5|$|Although 47 {{drivers were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier, {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure only 43 could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Drivers who recorded their lap times early in the session were at an advantage because the track was cooler and thus gave more grip. Edwards felt his car had oversteer during his run. Kyle Busch won the third pole position of his career {{with a time of}} 29.613 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Edwards, who was 0.125 seconds slower and had the pole position until Kyle Busch's lap. Martin qualified third, Gordon fourth, and Mike Skinner fifth. Biffle, Scott Riggs, Earnhardt, Kurt Busch, and Sadler completed the top ten qualifiers. The four drivers that failed to qualify were A. J. Allmendinger, Joe Nemechek, John Andretti, and Sauter (who crashed at turn-two on his first qualifying lap). Burney Lamar withdrew from the race prior to qualifying. After the qualifier Busch said his team was aware of the car's potential which was displayed in Friday's sole practice session and the January test session; he was worried about his vehicle being very tight going into the first and second turns having been on the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> throughout his fastest lap.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} allow the {{powertrain}} computer to optimize performance under every driving condition, the Insight’s <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> is a “drive-by-wire” type that uses an electronic position sensor instead of the conventional metal cable that usually connects the pedal to the engine’s throttle body. In the drive-by-wire system, the engine’s throttle body {{is controlled by the}} powertrain computer in response to the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> position—allowing the computer to determine the optimal throttle body, fuel, and CVT settings based on the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> position and its rate of travel.|$|E
25|$|The 2009 to 2010 {{model year}} Toyota Matrix (and its Pontiac Vibe relative) {{are subject to}} the 2009–2011 Toyota vehicle recalls {{regarding}} floor mat and <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> replacement.|$|E
50|$|Automobile <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> have {{historically}} been mechanical assemblies which link the pedal to the engine throttle by mechanical linkages or a Bowden cable. With the advent of electronic throttle control, <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> consist of a spring-loaded pedal arm connected to an electronic transducer. This transducer, typically a potentiometer orHall effect sensor, converts {{the position of the}} pedal arm to an electronic signal which is sent to an electronic control unit (ECU).|$|R
5000|$|February 22, 2011 [...] - [...] US: Toyota recalls an {{additional}} 2.17 million vehicles for <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> that become trapped on floor hardware.|$|R
5000|$|... 2006: The 2004 {{model year}} Ford Mustang Cobra was {{recalled}} by Ford for <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> {{that failed to}} return to idle after being fully pressed.|$|R
25|$|Current {{variants}} of the DSG will still downshift {{to the lowest}} possible gear ratio when the kick-down button is activated during full throttle whilst in manual mode. In Manual mode this kick-down is only activated by an additional button {{at the bottom of}} the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> travel; unless this is pressed the DSG will not downshift, and will simply perform a full-throttle acceleration in whatever gear was previously being utilised.|$|E
25|$|Achieving full {{acceleration}} or hill climbing, {{while avoiding}} engine speeds {{higher than a}} certain limit (e.g. 3000 or 4000 RPM), is difficult since it requires avoiding triggering the kick-down-switch. Avoiding triggering the kick-down-switch requires a good feel of the throttle pedal, but use of full throttle can still be achieved with a little sensitivity as the kick-down button is only activated beyond the normal full opening of the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most drivers {{reported}} initial {{difficulties in}} mastering the MINI E aggressive regenerative braking system which is {{integrated into the}} <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal.</b> However, all drivers said that once they learned to like the system, they discovered that they could travel more smoothly, and learned to control almost all acceleration and braking events with one pedal. They also discovered, thanks to the display panel information, that they recovered energy proportional to their expertise with the single pedal.|$|E
5000|$|Jan 21, 2010 [...] - [...] US: 2.3 million Toyota {{vehicles}} recalled due to faulty <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> (of those, 2.1 million already {{involved in}} floor mat recall).|$|R
5000|$|.....drivers {{generally}} {{prefer the}} feel, i.e., the tactile response, of conventional cable-driven throttle systems. Designers have therefore attempted {{to address this}} preference with mechanisms for emulating the tactile response of cable-driven <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals.</b>|$|R
50|$|During its {{production}} run, Lincoln made few {{changes to the}} first-generation Navigator. In 1999, alongside {{the addition of the}} InTech V8, power-adjustable brake and <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> were added; the previously optional 17-inch wheels became standard.|$|R
25|$|The {{incident}} devastated Audi {{sales in}} the United States, which did not rebound for 15 years. The initial incidents which prompted the report were found by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Transport Canada to have been attributable to operator error, where car owners had depressed the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> instead of the brake pedal. CBS issued a partial retraction, without acknowledging the test results of involved government agencies. Years later, Dateline NBC, a rival to 60 Minutes, {{was found guilty of}} similar tactics regarding the fuel tank integrity of General Motors pickup trucks.|$|E
25|$|On 15 February 2017 Toyota {{recalled}} all of {{the roughly}} 2,800 zero-emission Mirai {{cars on the road}} due to problems with the output voltage generated by their fuel cell system. According to Toyota, under unique driving conditions, such as if the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> is depressed to the wide open throttle position after driving on a long descent while using cruise control, there was a possibility the output voltage generated by the fuel cell boost converter could exceed the maximum voltage. Toyota dealers will update the fuel cell system software at no cost to the customer, it said. The process will take about half an hour, it said.|$|E
25|$|The BMW i3 has two pedals {{like all}} cars with {{automatic}} transmission. The <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> acts as both accelerator and engine brake. When the driver releases the pedal, the vehicle's kinetic energy is regenerated by the vehicle drivetrain to recharge the battery. This {{has the effect}} of slowing the car down. During the field testing of the Mini E, which features an accelerator that recharges the battery in this way, and consists of brakes that only apply to the rear wheels, BMW has learned that drivers tend to rely on the engine brake: around 75% of all deceleration maneuvers are initiated without the brake pedal in urban traffic areas. BMW also expected the i3 to use the same type of battery and powertrain that is being tested in the BMW ActiveE trials.|$|E
50|$|A pair of Autoloc levers {{move over}} the top of the {{steering}} wheel. They operate the throttle and ignition. A pedal controls the engine braking system. Road tests as late as 1911 noted how Rover cars lacked <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Some {{questions}} and confusion exist if the Toyota explanation fully accounts for all instances of the unintended acceleration involving Toyota vehicles. CTS Corporation, the American manufacturer {{of the electronic}} <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> that Toyota claims are at fault, has announced that: ...|$|R
5000|$|On January 21, 2010, Toyota {{initiated}} a second recall, {{this time in}} response to reports of <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> sticking in cars without floor mats. The company had received three such complaints in 2009. In its recall announcement, Toyota stated that: ...|$|R
25|$|Toyota {{recalled}} {{and replaced}} 55,000 optional all-weather rubber floor mats from the Toyota Camry and ES 350 in September 2007, citing {{the risk of}} unsecured mats jamming the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal.</b> In August 2009, the NHTSA probed the ES 350 following 40 acceleration control complaints, eight crashes and 12 injuries, with floor mats implicated in most cases. An accident involving a loaner ES 350 killed four persons near San Diego on 28 August. The NHTSA and San Diego County Sheriff's Department found that the car was wrongly fitted with an unsecured SUV rubber floor mat; the mat had jammed the accelerator, which an earlier driver had complained about. On 29 September, a Toyota safety notice advised floor mat removal, shift to Neutral (N) gear in an emergency, with a 3-second push button ignition press for engine shutoff. On 29 November, the 2007–2010 MY floor mat recall was revised to add shorter accelerator pedals, thinner replacement mats, and a brake override feature which ignores accelerator input when the brake pedal is depressed.|$|E
500|$|... 21st-place {{qualifier}} Casey Mears had his car lose {{power on}} his second warm-up lap after exiting the fourth turn and stopped in turn two; he was allowed one attempt to record a timed lap as a result. Dario Franchitti and Moreno qualified in the 22nd and 23rd positions, while Castroneves took 24th. Carpentier, who qualified in 25th, was observed speeding after he exited pit road and was limited to one lap time. On his run, he went up onto the track's dirty side in turn two and removed his foot from the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal.</b> Fernández qualified {{at the back of}} the grid in 26th position and turned off his engine on the backstretch while {{on his second}} warm-up lap and stopped at the bottom of turn three. After qualifying,Tagliani said: [...] "The car is very fast, the team was very quick earlier this year at Michigan and we're looking good right now. We didn't expect to qualify that fast actually, but the car was free and it was great. I think we have a good shot to stay up front with that time." ...|$|E
500|$|Da Matta {{appeared}} in victory lane {{and later on}} the podium to celebrate his third win of the season; the victory earned him $1 million. He was happy with the result: [...] "I was pretty confident {{in the car and}} could go flat down to the end. You need to be a little lucky, being {{in the right place at}} the right time. For everybody, it's a very exciting race. We were racing all together all the time." [...] Da Matta stated he did not want to lead the race with two laps remaining because of the draft and believed there would be a larger battle for the victory. Second-place finisher Papis said his team were planning a new strategy after the race's distance was reduced and had been looking forward to further racing and congratulated Da Matta on winning the race. Tagliani, who finished in third, revealed that he lifted from his <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> and ran in fifth gear on the backstraight and stated it was about conserving fuel and avoiding being caught in any incidents. He said the final ten laps felt like qualifying lap times and felt the race before then was [...] "kind of boring, just driving around and around." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{problem of}} sudden {{unintended}} acceleration {{has been reported}} to have existed in some Lexus vehicles and Toyota vehicles going back to 1999, when CTS did not even make this product for any customer, CTS believes that the rare slow return pedal phenomenon, which may occur in extreme environmental conditions, should absolutely not be linked with any sudden unintended acceleration incidents. CTS is also not aware of any accidents and injuries caused by the rare slow return pedal condition, to the best of its knowledge. CTS wishes to clarify that it does not, and has never made, any <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> for Lexus vehicles and that CTS also has no <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> in Toyota vehicles prior to model year 2005.|$|R
50|$|In June 2010, Chrysler also {{recalled}} 35,000 Dodge and Jeep {{models for}} sticky <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> made by CTS Corporation. Chrysler {{stated that the}} CTS pedals have pivot bushings that may dislodge, causing the accelerator to become stuck or slow to return to idle.|$|R
5000|$|... 2003: Power-adjustable {{brake and}} <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> were {{available}} on 2003 Voyagers.

500|$|Friday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} 90 minutes. The cars went out {{one at a}} time in the reverse order of the fastest combined practice laps. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. The session took place in dry and sunny weather conditions. Bräck recorded the track speed record at Rockingham Motor Speedway and secured his first pole position of the season, the seventh of his CART career, as well as his second at the circuit, with a time of 24.908 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Michael Andretti who set a lap time two-hundredths of a second slower than Bräck. Da Matta qualified third. He had removed his foot from the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> when driving through the fourth turn and felt he could have started from first place. Takagi took fourth, and Franchitti started fifth after steering right to the track's outside on his second lap due to oversteer and reduced his speed preventing him from setting a faster time. Junqueira's car was set up with a large amount of downforce which restricted him to sixth, and Paul Tracy secured seventh because his car slid in the third and fourth turns. Tony Kanaan qualified in eighth and was satisfied with his lap which was recorded in a back-up car.|$|E
2500|$|Certain 2009 to 2010 {{model year}} Toyota Corolla (mainly U.S.-built models with VIN# {{beginning}} in [...] "1NX" [...] or [...] "2T1") {{were subject to}} the 2010 Toyota vehicle recalls regarding floor mat and <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> replacement.|$|E

50|$|In January 2010, the Toyota recalls {{affected}} {{the products of}} the Ford Group because Ford used the same supplier (CTS Corporation). It was suspected that the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> were defective and posed a danger. About 1600 Ford Transits of the 2006 China generation were affected by the recall.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2010, Toyota {{suspended}} {{sales of}} eight recalled vehicle models to fix <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> with mechanical problems {{that could cause}} them to become stuck.

5000|$|On February 8, 2011, the NHTSA, in {{collaboration}} with NASA, released its findings into the investigation on the Toyota drive-by-wire throttle system. After a 10-month search, NASA and NHTSA scientists found no electronic defect in Toyota vehicles. Driver error or pedal misapplication was found {{responsible for most of}} the incidents. The report ended stating, [...] "Our conclusion is Toyota's problems were mechanical, not electrical." [...] This included sticking <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals,</b> and pedals caught under floor mats.|$|R
2500|$|... 1895: Frederick William Lanchester and {{his brother}} build the first petrol driven four-wheeled car in Britain. Lanchester also {{experiments}} with the wick carburetor, fuel injection, turbochargers and invents the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> and first uses the pendulum governor for controlling {{the speed of a}} car engine. In 1893 he designs and builds his first engine (a vertical single cylinder) that is fitted to the first British motorboat.|$|E
2500|$|Six-cylinder Hornets {{could be}} ordered {{with a new}} British {{supplied}} Laycock de Normanville [...] "J-type" [...] overdrive. Optional on cars with a manual three-speed transmission, the unit was controlled by a pushbutton {{at the end of}} the turn signal stalk. The overdrive unit engages automatically at speeds above [...] and drops out at [...] It also included an <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> kickdown switch for faster passing.|$|E
2500|$|Under [...] "normal", {{progressive}} and linear acceleration and deceleration, the DSG shifts in a sequential manner; i.e., under acceleration: 1st → 2nd → 3rd → 4th → 5th → 6th, {{and the same}} sequence reversed for deceleration. However, the DSG can also skip the normal sequential method, by missing gears, and shift two or more gears. This is most apparent if the car is being driven at sedate speeds {{in one of the}} higher gears with a light throttle opening, and the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> is then pressed down, engaging the kick-down function. During kick-down, the DSG will skip gears, shifting directly to the most appropriate gear depending on speed and throttle opening. This kick-down may be engaged by any increased <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> opening, and is completely independent of the additional resistance to be found when the pedal is pressed fully to the floor, which will activate a similar kick-down function when in Manual operation mode. The seven-speed unit in the 2007 Audi variants will not automatically shift to 6th gear; rather, it stays at 5th to keep power available at a high RPM while cruising.|$|E
50|$|Left-foot braking is the {{technique}} of using the left foot to operate the brake pedal in an automobile, leaving the right foot dedicated to the throttle pedal. It contrasts with the practice of using the left foot to operate the clutch pedal, leaving the right foot to share the duties of controlling both brake and <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some cars {{also have}} memory adjustments, which can recall (usually) two {{different}} adjustments {{of the seat}} by pressing a button. The 1981 Cadillac was the first car to offer this feature in its modern version. By the 1990s, these systems began allowing customized settings and adjustment for such conveniences as rearview mirrors, brake and <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals,</b> climate control and the car's stereo system.|$|R
