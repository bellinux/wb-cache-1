500|$|Woolverton created Belle {{as part of}} [...] "her self-directed {{mandate to}} move women and girls forward." [...] The Express-Times {{described}} the character as an intelligent young woman who [...] "sings songs <b>about</b> <b>reading</b> and wanting to gain knowledge, rather than falling in love." [...] Woolverton credits Belle's knowledge and love of books with providing the character with a [...] "point of view {{of her life and}} that doesn't necessarily involve a man getting her there." [...] One of the film's main themes, Belle is considered an outsider because her love of reading provides her with knowledge of the outside world as opposed to her [...] "narrow-minded" [...] village peers. Writing for Wired.com, Matt Blum dubbed Belle [...] "the geekiest heroine of any Disney animated film", exemplified by an opening number that demonstrates just how much she does not fit in with her peers due to her intelligence and active imagination. Similarly, Boxoffices Amy Nicholson coined the character [...] "Disney's Smartest Heroine," [...] while Rob Burch of The Hollywood News observed that the character [...] "comes across as arrogant at times" [...] because she [...] "spends much of the first act complaining." [...] In her book Sex, Love and Abuse: Discourses on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, author Sharon Hayes described Belle as [...] "the quintessential beautiful young ingenue." [...] Comparing Belle's personality to that of the princess in the Brothers Grimm's fairy tale [...] "The Frog Prince", The Meanings of [...] "Beauty and the Beast": A Handbook author Jerry Griswold described the character as a similarly [...] "feisty and outspoken" [...] heroine. Writing for St. Francis Xavier University, Dawn Elizabeth England observed that Belle possesses equally as many traditionally feminine as she does masculine traits, citing her bravery, independence and assertiveness as masculine, and her sensitivity and fearfulness as feminine. According to Hard Bodies: Hollywood Masculinity in the Reagan Era author Susan Jeffords, [...] "Belle's credentials as heroine are established ... when she {{is the only one of}} the town's single women not to swoon over Gaston," [...] while the character's love of reading is essentially manipulated [...] "to mark her as better than the rest of the townspeople." [...] Writing for The Statesman, David O'Connor cited Belle's intelligence and bibliophilia as [...] "in stark opposition to the insensitive and significantly dim-witted Gaston." [...] Critics continue to debate over whether Belle or the Beast is the film's protagonist. Susan Jeffords, author of Hard Bodies: Hollywood Masculinity in the Reagan Era, felt that although Belle appears to be the protagonist in Beaumont's original fairy tale, the character becomes [...] "less the focus of the narrative" [...] in Disney's adaptation and more of a [...] "mechanism for solving the Beast's 'dilemma'." [...] In her article [...] "The Tangled Evolution of the Disney Princess", Noelle Buffam felt that Belle arrived just in time when Disney's heroines were [...] "in a dire need for some change," [...] awarding her [...] "the red stamp of approval" [...] for her intelligence and spirit.|$|E

Rawlinson reads the piece as primarily <b>about</b> <b>reading</b> itself, and the social implications of certain types of reading; [...] "inside the apparently random concoction of prose, song and slapstick [...] lies an extraordinary, almost dazzling examination of the relationship between our habits of reading and the society they produce [...] Blake consistently and consciously foregrounds how our understanding of our society, our voices and even our perceptions are governed by our habits of reading [...] An Island contains a deliberate and careful plan to challenge [...] misreadings by teaching us how to read the world comically. It is nothing less than a degree course in comic Vision."

As such Rawlinson feels An Island is best described as [...] "philosoparody." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other critics, such as Duckworth, {{contend that}} Austen's heroines [...] "support and {{maintain}} an inherited structure {{of values and}} behavior", displaying a version of Christian stoicism. He emphasizes that Austen's novels highlight the dangers of individualism; her heroines emerge from isolation and despair to be reinstated into society. In Mansfield Park, in particular, the morally suspect characters—the Crawfords, Rushworth and the Bertram daughters—represent individualism. The heroine of Emma embodies the dangers of individualism as her position of power allows her to affect everyone in Highbury. In Sense and Sensibility, Austen juxtaposes Elinor, who regulates the expression of her feelings according to social conventions, with Marianne, who expresses her feelings in accordance with sensibility and literary conventions. The novel suggests that Elinor's behaviour [...] "is based on a truer perception {{of the nature of}} emotions" [...] than Marianne's, even though it is based on social convention, because those very conventions allow her to process emotions like grief, while sensibility forces Marianne to indulge it. By following social conventions, Elinor is more sensitive to the feelings of those around her; her emotions bring [...] "together private and public experience, or one's relations with oneself and with others". Individual romantic experience is less important than the social good that comes of Elinor's self-denial; however, that very self-denial leads to personal happiness in the end when she marries her love. As Lynch explains, [...] "s a whole Austen's writing is about social relations—the relationship between, say, domestic life and public life—and <b>about</b> <b>reading</b> relations—about the textual conventions by which audiences are formed and distinguished. Her narratives weave together the processes of romantic choice and cultural discrimination." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{situation}} changed {{somewhat by}} the late nineteenth century. The clergy's colossal efforts to educate the peasants resulted in the relative loss of priestly power. New members of the intelligentsia arose from the peasantry, some of whom objected to what they {{considered to be the}} priestly patronizing attitudes towards peasants as childlike or drunkards needing to be taught and led. Simultaneously, urban intellectuals no longer had to go through priests in order to spread their ideas among a newly literate peasantry. The Radical movement appeared in Western Ukraine in the 1870s. Its political party, founded in 1890, was explicitly anti-clerical and sought to limit the clergy's influence. The Radicals helped to spread discontent against the status quo by criticizing sacramental fees that were considered to be too high for the poor peasants, publicizing disputes over land rights between the Church and the peasantry, and attacking priests' authority on moral matters. Often having to wait until the priests had taught the peasants how to read, the Radicals took over many of the reading clubs that the priests had founded and turned them into sources of anti-clerical agitation. [...] In the words of one church leader speaking <b>about</b> <b>reading</b> clubs, [...] "instead of national love they have awakened in our peasant self-love and arrogance." [...] The Radicals' anti-clerical efforts helped to curb the clergy's power. For example, father M. Sichynsy, who had been elected to the Galician Diet in 1883, lost an election to the Reichsrat in 1889 to a Polish candidate, count Borkowski in part because of conflicts between the priest and local peasants over land usage. While the clergy dominated the ethnic Ukrainian parliamentary delegations in the 1860s and 1870s, of the 28 Ukrainian members of Austria's parliament in 1909-1911 only four were clerics. Despite such changes, the largest and most popular western Ukrainian political party from the late nineteenth until through the mid twentieth century continued to be the Ukrainian National Democratic Party, founded and led by the priest's son Kost Levytsky. [...] Nearly sixty percent {{of the members of the}} Ukrainian National Council, the legislative body of the Western Ukrainian People's Republic that ruled western Ukraine from 1918-1919, came from priestly families. [...] The head of the Ukrainian Catholic Church, Andrey Sheptytsky, would be seen as a [...] "father figure" [...] for most western Ukrainians until his death in the 1940s.|$|E
