40|$|Throughout most of {{the twentieth}} century, <b>agrarian</b> <b>parties</b> have been a common {{phenomenon}} in European party systems. In Scandinavian countries and Switzerland, <b>agrarian</b> <b>parties</b> developed into enduring and relevant parties, while in other countries, such as France, Belgium and Germany, <b>agrarian</b> <b>parties</b> were flash-in-the-pan <b>parties.</b> The Dutch <b>agrarian</b> <b>parties</b> are a somewhat unusual case compared to many other countries. In terms of electoral strength and influence, they were rather irrelevant, although the pre-war Plattelandersbond and the post-war Boerenpartij both managed to hold at least one seat in parliament for nearly twenty years. Between 1963 and 1967, the Boerenpartij even served as the main populist party in the Netherlands. This contribution will analyse {{the similarities and differences}} between the two parties, as well as the political opportunity structure related to each of the parties in the Netherlands...|$|R

The Labor Party split in 1921, with the left wing establishing the Communist Party. Although strong during the 1920s, they were marginalized through the 1930s. A short-lived Labor Government reigned in 1928, but did not establish a sound parliamentary support until the 1935 Nygaardsvold's Cabinet, based on an alliance with the <b>Agrarian</b> <b>Party.</b> During the 1920s and 1930s, Norway established three dependencies, Bouvetøya, Peter I Island and Queen Maud Land, annexed Jan Mayen and secured sovereignty of Svalbard through the Svalbard Treaty.

25|$|Despite {{the slow}} rate of {{industrialization}} into the 19th century, many important changes {{were taking place}} in the agrarian economy because of innovations and the large population growth. These innovations included government-sponsored programs of enclosure, aggressive exploitation of agricultural lands, and the introduction of new crops such as the potato. Because the Swedish peasantry had never been enserfed as elsewhere in Europe, the Swedish farming culture began to take on a critical role in the Swedish political process, which has continued through modern times with modern <b>Agrarian</b> <b>party</b> (now called the Centre Party). Between 1870 and 1914, Sweden began developing the industrialized economy that exists today.|$|E

While the party had historically functioned as part of a two-party coalition with the centre-right Liberal Party (and its predecessors) for most of its existence, tensions have existed over the coalition arrangement, and on two occasions the party split over the issue.|$|E

25|$|A traditionalist figure whose {{perspective}} on {{life was a}} combination of nationalism and Humanism, Sadoveanu moved between right- and left-wing political forces throughout the interwar period, while serving terms in Parliament. Rallying with People's Party, the National <b>Agrarian</b> <b>Party,</b> and the National Liberal Party-Brătianu, he was editor of the leftist newspapers Adevărul and Dimineața, and was the target of a violent far right press campaign. After World War II, Sadoveanu became a political associate of the Romanian Communist Party. He wrote in favor of the Soviet Union and Stalinism, joined the Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union and adopted Socialist realism. Many of his texts and speeches, including the political novel Mitrea Cocor and the famous slogan Lumina vine de la Răsărit ("The Light Arises in the East"), are also viewed as propaganda in favor of communization.|$|E
25|$|However, {{accidents}} involving the aircraft entering uncontrolled spins continued with another aircraft being lost on 25 July 1930. At this point pilot {{confidence in the}} aircraft reached an all-time low, with seven officer pilots writing a letter of protest to the Ministry of Defence, voicing {{their opposition to the}} further use of the M.F.9. The criticism led to the halting of work on five M.F.9s then under construction (F.136, F.138, F.140 and replacement machines F.130 and F.132), although one almost complete M.F.9c (F.142) was finished in February 1932. F.142 and the incomplete aircraft had steel tube hulls instead of the wooden constructions of the earlier aircraft. An investigative commission concluded on 4 May 1932 that even the improved M.F.9c model was not usable for training purposes and recommended that the type should be discarded entirely. Director Høver strongly opposed this view, but did not win through with his view that further improvements could save the aircraft and the type was retired and put in reserve on 17 July 1932. The document sent by the Ministry of Defence to the RNNAS was signed by the <b>Agrarian</b> <b>Party</b> Minister of Defence, Vidkun Quisling.|$|E

The clash led to Goga's creation of the splinter National <b>Agrarian</b> <b>Party,</b> which, although never an important force, obtained more of the vote in the 1932 elections (approx. 3% compared to Averescu's 2%).|$|E
