5|$|In September 1933, Bruce was {{appointed}} by Lyons to replace the ailing Sir Granville Ryrie as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, giving him ambassadorial rank. He formally resigned from parliament on 7 October 1933. Bruce would excel in the new post, becoming a trusted confidant among Conservative politicians and a familiar face in British government circles, which led to him at one point considering entering British politics formally. Bruce was particularly close to Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, with whom he frequently consulted, and was notably influential in pressing for Edward VIII's abdication in 1936. His importance and power in London was {{due in part to}} the free rein that Lyons gave him a rarity in the history of the position. Combined with the turmoil and frequent ministerial changes within the Commonwealth Department of External Affairs, Bruce was generally credited as Australia's most influential <b>and</b> <b>credible</b> international representative during his posting, often determining matters of foreign policy in his own right.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMAP estimators <b>and</b> HPD <b>credible</b> {{sets are}} often criticized in the {{literature}} because of paradoxical behaviour {{due to a lack}} of equivariance under reparametrization. In this paper, we propose a new version of MAP estimators <b>and</b> HPD <b>credible</b> sets that avoid this undesirable feature. Moreover, in the special case of non-informative prior, the new MAP estimators coincide with the equivariant frequentist ML estimators.

The two suspects were quickly tracked down and arrested. In custody, each man claimed that the other had pulled the trigger. Atkins's version of the events, however, was found to contain a number of inconsistencies. Doubts concerning Atkins's testimony were strengthened when a cell-mate claimed that Atkins had confessed to him that he had shot Nesbitt. A deal of life imprisonment was negotiated with Jones in return for his full testimony against Atkins. The jury decided that Jones's version of events was the more coherent <b>and</b> <b>credible,</b> and convicted Atkins of capital murder.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>credible</b> sets <b>and</b> marginal <b>credible</b> intervals {{resulting from the}} horseshoe prior in the sparse multivariate normal means model. We do so in an adaptive setting without assuming knowledge of the sparsity level (number of signals). We consider both the hierarchical Bayes method of putting a prior on the unknown sparsity level and the empirical Bayes method with the sparsity level estimated by maximum marginal likelihood. We show that <b>credible</b> balls <b>and</b> marginal <b>credible</b> intervals have good frequentist coverage and optimal size if the sparsity level of the prior is set correctly. By general theory honest confidence sets cannot adapt in size to an unknown sparsity level. Accordingly the hierarchical <b>and</b> empirical Bayes <b>credible</b> sets based on the horseshoe prior are not honest over the full parameter space. We show that {{this is due to}} over-shrinkage for certain parameters and characterise the set of parameters for which <b>credible</b> balls <b>and</b> marginal <b>credible</b> intervals do give correct uncertainty quantification. In particular we show that the fraction of false discoveries by the marginal Bayesian procedure is controlled by a correct choice of cut-off...|$|R

25|$|The European Parliament heard {{testimony}} about organ harvesting in China during a 6 December 2012 session {{on human rights}} in China. One year later, it passed a resolution expressing “deep concern over the persistent <b>and</b> <b>credible</b> reports of systematic, state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in the People’s Republic of China, including from large numbers of Falun Gong practitioners imprisoned for their religious beliefs, {{as well as from}} members of other religious and ethnic minority groups.” The resolution called for the immediate release of all prisoners of conscience, and urged Chinese authorities to respond to United Nations inquiries about the source of organs used in transplants. In March 2014, the European Economic and Social Committee in Brussels convened a follow-up event on organ transplant abuses in China. Participants and speakers at the session endorsed the recommendations of the parliamentary resolution, which recognized that Falun Gong and other minority groups are targets of forced organ harvesting in China. EESC President Henri Malosse called for greater pressure to be put on the Chinese government to end organ transplant abuses.|$|E

However, questions about {{the authenticity of the}} documents persist, with claims that the documents were obtained either from Israel or the MEK, an Iranian dissident group officially considered to be a terrorist organization by the United States, and that investigations into the alleged studies are intended to reveal intelligence about Iran's conventional weapons programs. Some IAEA officials have requested a clear statement be made by the agency that it could not affirm the documents' authenticity. They cite that as a key document in the study had since been proven to have been fraudulently altered, it put in doubt the entire collection.|$|E
