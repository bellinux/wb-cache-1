40|$|<b>Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</b> <b>copolymers</b> (ABS) {{are known}} to be {{sensitive}} towards ageing which can lead to color changes, primary interest in this study. The color changes were expressed in terms of the CIELAB color system. ABS plaques were subjected to heat ageing and artificial weathering. Uncolored ABS and dark gray colored specimens were employed. The pigmented ABS plaques were also imposed with different surface textures. In general, the uncolored material suffered from the most severe discoloration and the artificial weathering produced the strongest effect. For both types of specimens, a clear yellowing took place. Both the pigment system and the surface texture affected the color development during the ageing test. The latter can be of significant importance in certain applications when components with different surface textures are placed adjacent to each other. The surface micro-hardness increased with increasing ageing time and its change followed that of the discoloration. Chemical changes of the surface layers were characterized by FTIR and were in accordance with results reported in the literature; i. e., an increase of the bands associated with carbonyl groups with increasing ageing time and a decrease of the bands associated with the polybutadiene phase clearly indicated chemical degradation due to ageing treatments...|$|R
40|$|Three metal {{hydroxide}} nanorods (MHR) with uniform diameters were synthesized, {{and then}} combined with graphene nanosheets (GNS) to prepare <b>acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene</b> (ABS) <b>copolymer</b> composites. An excellent dispersion of exfoliated two-dimensional (2 -D) GNS and 1 -D MHR in the ABS matrix was achieved. The effects of combined GNS and MHR on the mechanical, thermal and flame retardant {{properties of the}} ABS composites were investigated. With the addition of 2 wt% GNS and 4 wt% Co(OH) 2, the tensile strength, bending strength and storage modulus of the ABS composites were increased by 45. 1 %, 40. 5 % and 42. 3 % respectively. The ABS/GNS/Co(OH) 2 ternary composite shows the lowest maximum weight loss rate and highest residue yield. Noticeable reduction in the flammability was achieved {{with the addition of}} GNS and Co(OH) 2, due to the formation of more continuous and compact charred layers that retarded the mass and heat transfer between the flame and the polymer matrix...|$|R

The Charpy notched impact strength decreased quickly when φ≤ 10 %, and then decreased gently with increasing φ. While the bending strength increased when φ≤ 10 %, and then it decreased gradually with increasing φ. However, the effects of filler size and its surface treatment on these mechanical properties were insignificant. Furthermore, the Vicat softening temperature (TV) of the samples was measured at a constant loading and a temperature ramp rate. The result showed that TV increased with the addition of.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of waste computers {{is an issue that}} is gaining increasing interest around the world. In this paper, results from the fast pyrolysis in a fluidized bed reactor of three different waste computer monitor casings composed of mainly <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</b> (ABS) <b>copolymer</b> and two different waste computer body casings composed of mostly poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) type polymers are presented. Preliminary characterization of the waste plastics was investigated using coupled thermogravimetric analysis-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (TGA-FT-IR). The results showed that the plastics decomposed in two stages. For the ABS-containing monitor casings, aromatic and aliphatic material were released in the first and second stages. The PVC-containing computer body casing samples showed a first-stage evolution of HCl and a second stage evolution of aromatic and aliphatic material and further HCl. In addition, each of the five plastics was fast-pyrolyzed in a laboratory-scale fluidized bed reactor at 500 °C. The fluidized bed pyrolysis led to the conversion of most of the plastics to pyrolysis oil, although the two PVC computer body cases produced large quantities of HCl. The pyrolysis oils were characterized by GC-MS and it was found that they were chemically very heterogeneous and contained a wide range of aliphatic, aromatic, halogenated, oxygenated, and nitrogenated compounds...|$|R
40|$|Multiwall carbon {{nanotubes}} (MWNTs) were melt-mixed in polyamide 6 (PA 6) and <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</b> (ABS) <b>copolymer</b> blends using {{a simultaneous}} mixing protocol {{in order to}} investigate the state of dispersion of MWNTs in PA 6 /ABS blends. The blend composition was varied from 40 / 60 (wt/wt) to 60 / 40 (wt/wt) in PA 6 /ABS blends, which showed co-continuous' morphology {{in the presence of}} MWNTs. State of dispersion of MWNTs in these blends was assessed through bulk electrical conductivity measurements, morphological analysis, solution experiments, and UV-vis spectroscopic analysis. MWNTs were subsequently modified with a novel organic modifier, sodium salt of 6 -aminohexanoic acid (Na-AHA), to improve the state of dispersion of MWNTs. Blends with unmodified MWNTs exhibited the DC electrical conductivity in the range approximate to 10 (- 11) to approximate to 10 (- 5) S/cm, whereas blends with Na-AHA-modified MWNTs exhibited DC electrical conductivity in the range approximate to 10 (- 7) to approximate to 10 (- 5) S/cm. The reduction in MWNTs agglomerate' size (approximate to 73. 7 m for 40 / 60 blend with unmodified MWNTs to approximate to 59. 9 m in the corresponding blend with Na-AHA-modified MWNTs) was observed through morphological analysis.

The mechanical properties, morphology and rheological behavior of the impact modified PPO/PA 6 blends were investigated. The selective location of the maleated copolymers in one phase or at interface accounted for the different toughening effects of the maleated copolymer, which {{is closely related to}} their molecular structure and composition. SEBS-g-MA was uniformly dispersed in PPO phase and greatly toughened PPO/PA 6 blends even at low temperature. MBS-g-MA particles were mainly dispersed in the PA 6 phase and around the PPO phase, resulting in a significant enhancement of the notched Izod impact strength of PPO/PA 6 blends from 45 J/m to 281 J/m at the MBS-g-MA content of 20 phr. In comparison, the ABS-g-MA was mainly dispersed in PA 6 phase without much influencing the original mechanical properties of the PPO/PA 6 blend.

Effect of {{co-monomer}} {{content in}} <b>Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene</b> <b>copolymer</b> (ABS) on the rheological property of sawdust reinforced ABS composites was investigated using capillary die rheometer. Three grades of commercial ABS resin were used. Sawdust from Para rubber tree treated with N- 2 (aminoethyl) 3 -aminopropyl trimethoxy silane was blended with ABS by melt blending process using twin-screw extruder. From the results, shear thinning behavior {{was found for}} all of composites in the same shear rate ranges for testing that were investigated. At the low shear rate, the composites which contain higher acrylonitrile content, showed higher viscosity. At high shear rate, the viscosity of each co-monomer dependent composites tends to come {{close to each other}} on the curves. In this study, Carreau’s model was used for curve fitting and those parameters were also determined. Die swell ratio of the composites tended to increase at the initial ranges of shear rate of 10 - 500 s- 1, and then the swelling ratio value decreased dramatically once the shear rate were further applied.

30|$|An epoxy {{monolith}} layer with {{porous structure}} is fabricated {{on the surface}} of a stainless steel (SUS) plate by polymerization induced phase separation process as the mediator for the bonding of SUS and various thermoplastic resin plates. Bonding strength is evaluated in the presence and absence of the epoxy monolith layer by a tensile lap shear test. The morphology of fracture surfaces is observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in order to clarify the anchor effect of molten resins into the pores of the epoxy monoliths. The bonding strength values are calculated to be 1.2 ‒ 2.7  MPa based on an apparent adhesion area for the bonding of SUS with polyethylene, polypropylene, polyoxymethylene and <b>acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene</b> <b>copolymer</b> {{in the presence of the}} epoxy monolith mediator. These values are 2 ‒ 30 times higher than those for direct metal-resin bonding. By the SEM observation, stretched needle-like structures were detected on the both fracture surfaces of the resins and the epoxy monoliths. The direct observation of the stretched debris out of the holes located at the monolith surfaces indicates the significant anchor effect for the present metal-resin bonding system. The bonding system mediated by the epoxy monolith layer is conveniently used for the bonding of dissimilar materials such as metals and resins without any special process and apparatus.|$|E
40|$|Injection {{moulding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly used manufacturing methods for the production of polymer-based components such as car bumpers and other automotive details. The surface appearance of these products is of great importance since it is directly connected to the perceived quality. Injection-moulded thermoplastics can exhibit a number of surface defects which lower their quality impression. To a large extent, this work deals with characterisation of flow-induced surface defects called tiger stripes or flow marks. They consist in alternating glossy and dull bands which appear on the surface of injection-moulded polymers, especially when long flow lengths are involved. The flow marks are approximately perpendicular to the flow direction and they are often opposite in phase on the two sides of the moulded object. The materials typically used for injection moulding of car components, and studied in the present work, are elastomer-modified polypropylene grades containing fillers. Two main theories behind the formation of the flow marks are discussed here: a slip-stick phenomenon and a snake-like flow which can initiate an unstable flow front during the filling of the mould. Several techniques were used in order to characterise the banded regions. Stereographic scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as well as gloss evaluation, revealed that the dull regions were rougher and less glossy than the other type of bands. SEM micrographs of the cross section of the stripes indicated differences in the filler distribution between the different bands; the dull bands seemed to contain a lower amount of filler in the proximity of their surface. A course of events leading to this difference is suggested. Rheological studies of the polymer melts suggested that a higher melt elasticity is beneficial since it reduces the propensity for the defects generation. The effect of ageing on the severity of the flow marks is discussed in terms of surface roughness, surface hardness and thermal stability. <b>Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</b> (ABS) <b>copolymer</b> is another engineering polymer widely used to produce vehicle interior components as well as domestic appliances, toys, etc. ABS is known to be sensitive towards ageing especially when exposed to UV-light. The effect of ageing on the appearance of injection-moulded ABS samples was studied here, in particular colour changes were evaluated. Natural coloured and grey coloured ABS specimens, containing the same type and the same amount of stabilisers, were exposed to a heat ageing treatment and to artificial weathering. In general, the natural coloured ABS suffered the most severe discolouration and the artificial weathering produced the strongest effect. Interestingly, an imposed surface texture appeared to affect the colour change induced by ageing. Chemical and mechanical changes on the surface layers of the investigated samples were reported...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of char formation effect of zinc acetylacetonate (Zn(acac) (2)) on <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</b> <b>copolymer</b> (ABS) was studied. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) {{was used to}} study the mass loss and char yield of ABS composites. In situ temperature-dependent Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to characterize the chemical change during thermal decomposition. Roman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were applied to characterize the structure and morphology of the char after combustion. Results showed {{that the presence of}} Zn(acac) (2) not only slowed down thermal decomposition of the ABS composites, but also increased the charred residue. A more compact and denser char layer with higher graphitization degree was formed for ABS composites with Zn(acac) (2). To study the char formation {{mechanism of}} Zn(acac) (2) on ABS, thermal decomposition was analyzed for the composites of Zn(acac) (2) with PB, PS and SAN, respectively. Also, the chemical structure change was investigated for Zn(acac) (2) during thermal decomposition. Based on these results, it was deduced that the increase of char yield of ABS composites was probably attributed to the interaction between the units of acrylonitrile in ABS and zinc acetate, produced during the thermal decomposition of Zn(acac) (2).

In this work, one virgin and one recycled ternary blend consisting of these three components were melt-blended in an extruder to study the influence of processing conditions on the mechanical and thermal properties. Favourable processing conditions with respect to tensile properties of the virgin blend were found at intermediate screw rotations (40 - 80 rpm) and relatively low barrel temperatures (170 - 220 oC). The recycled blend and recycled ABS, HIPS and PP showed higher stiffness and yield stress, but lower elongation at break than the corresponding virgin materials. The stiffness and yield stress of the blends were found mainly to follow the rule of mixtures of their components while the elongation at break exhibited adverse characteristics indicating incompatibility between ABS, HIPS and PP. Differential scanning calorimetry showed an additional melt peak for the recycled blend compared to the virgin blend, otherwise the transitions were similar. The additional peak could be assigned to polyethylene in the PP component. The onset of the thermo-oxidative degradation was found to be at almost 190 oC {{in the case of the}} recycled blend, which was high considering that it was close to that of the virgin blend and higher than expected from the rule of mixtures of the recycled components...|$|E

The dispersion of the inorganic nanomatenals was evaluated by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, which confirmed nanocomposite formation. The thermal stability of nanomatenals and nanocomposites was assessed by thermogravimetnc analysis and the identity of the degradation products was investigating by in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and ultraviolet spectroscopy. The flammability properties of all the nanocomposites were evaluated using the cone calorimeter. The changes in the degradation products of PE, EVA, PS and PMMA nanocomposites were followed and the relationship between these changes and the unique structure of montmonllonite was highlighted. Modified clays known to have high thermal stability (quinolinium and oligomeric clays) have been shown to be suitable for nanocomposite synthesis with poly(ethylene terephtalate) (PET).

40|$|This work {{concerns}} a waste {{electrical and electronic equipment}} blend of recycled plastics (WEEEBR), reprocessed {{from a low}} density thermoplastics batch (600 kg) by removal of non-thermoplastic contamination (1. 2 weight % (wt%)). Some well-distributed inorganic domains (mainly 5 - 20 µm) containing Ca, Na, Mg, Fe or Ba still remained in the WEEEBR after melt-filtration. The WEEEBR consisted of high impact polystyrene (HIPS, 42 wt%), <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</b> <b>copolymer</b> (ABS, 38 wt%), polypropylene (PP, 10 wt%) and other thermoplastics (10 wt%). Although PP was a minor component in the blend, the phase separation of the polymers and the shear yielding observed in the fracture surfaces indicated the existence of partial co-continuous structures at appropriate mixing times, viscosity ratios and temperatures. Co-continuity of WEEEBR was suggested as a transitory morphological state, which was only observed by twin screw extrusion under certain processing conditions (around 60 rpm, 200 oC). These processing conditions resulted in a yield point and an elongation at break (εb) at about 5 %. Increasing the screw rotation rate by only 30 rpm or increasing the barrel temperature by only 20 oC resulted in a WEEEBR material without a yield point and about half the εb-value. The processing conditions in single screw extrusion or injection moulding were not observed to yield a co-continuous PP phase. Furthermore, injection moulding resulted in a layered structure with a small variation in composition in the layered structure. In addition, single screw extruded WEEEBR contained a significant amount of voids (50 - 300 µm), reducing the load-bearing cross-sectional area and probably giving rise to stress concentrations. The WEEEBR was already chemically degraded in the as-received state, which was indicated by a smaller than expected exotherm associated with the lower activation energy and the antioxidants were mainly de-activated (consumed). An increase in stiffness and a significant decrease in ductility were observed after reprocessing, which could to some extent be attributed to physical ageing caused by the cooling conditions used. The ductility of WEEEBR was significantly improved by compatibilisation, which was expected to promote the shear yielding deformation mechanism, particularly around defects and inclusions. Among four studied compatibilisers, the addition of only 2. 5 wt% SEBS was found to increase the εb-values of uncompatibilised WEEEBR more than 5 times...|$|E
30|$|Tough and {{reliable}} bonding between dissimilar materials {{is one of}} the most important and challenging topics in the fields of adhesion and adhesives because metal components used for automobiles, aircrafts, and mechanical parts have increasingly been replaced by lightweight plastics and polymer composites during recent years [1, 2]. Mechanical interaction between rough surfaces accompanying an anchor effect as well as chemical bond formation such as reacting-type adhesives are important to obtain reliable bonding systems. For the dissimilar materials bonding such as metals and resins, closer contact and good affinity are required at an interface between both adherends with completely different surface properties [3 – 10]. Especially, the surface modification of metals has been considered to be a key process. In fact, many techniques by chemical conversion, chemical etching, plasma and laser treatments, as well as primer coating have been developed in order to realize high-strength adhesion for metal-resin bonding during injection, insertion, and transfer moldings and heat pressing processes [1, 2]. On the other hand, the surface structures of polymers are readily controlled using several phase separation systems. Monolithic porous materials consisting of polymers or inorganic compounds have been prepared by thermally induced phase separation [11], non-solvent induced phase separation [12], and polymerization induced phase separation [13]. They are mainly used as separation filters, column packing materials for ion exchange and chromatography, catalyst supports, and electrical or thermal insulators due to their high strength and porosity [14 – 18]. Among them, it should be noted that Tsujioka and coworkers reported the fabrication of epoxy  monoliths with a bicontinuous and highly porous structure and its application to the column packing materials for high-performance chromatographic and reacting systems [14]. The porous epoxy monoliths are expected to be applied to the modification of metal surfaces and adhesion to dissimilar materials including resins, but no report has ever been seen for the research on the dissimilar materials bonding using epoxy monoliths in the literature. In this study, we propose a new type of metal-resin bonding technique using monolithic epoxy resins as the adhesive layer manufactured on a metal surface by polymerization induced phase separation process. The bonding strengths were determined for the bonding system using a stainless steel (SUS) plate and polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyoxymethylene (POM), and <b>acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene</b> <b>copolymer</b> (ABS) as the thermoplastic resins in the presence of an epoxy monolith layer as the mediator for the robust bonding. The morphology of fracture surfaces was also investigated in order to discuss an anchor effect on this bonding system.|$|E
