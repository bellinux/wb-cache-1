40|$|Patients with {{hydrocephalus}} {{and risk}} factors for overdrainage may be submitted to ventricular shunt (VS) implant with <b>antisiphon</b> device. The objective {{of this study was}} to prospectively evaluate for two years the clinical and tomographic results of the implant of fixed-pressure valves with <b>antisiphon</b> device SPHERA® in 35 adult patients, with hydrocephalus and {{risk factors for}} overdrainage. Of these, 3 had congenital hydrocephalus in adult patients with very dilated ventricles (Evans index > 50 %), 3 had symptomatic overdrainage after previous VS implant (subdural hematoma, hygroma or slit ventricle syndrome), 1 had previous chronic subdural hematoma, 15 had normal pressure hydrocephalus with final lumbar pressure < 5 cm H 2 O after tap test (40 mL), 6 had pseudotumor cerebri, and 7 had hydrocephalus due to other causes. Clinical improvement was observed and sustained in 94. 3 % of the patients during the two-year period with no computed tomography (CT) evidence of hypo or overdrainage, and no immediate early or late significant complications...|$|E
40|$|Ventriculo-peritoneal {{shunting}} is {{the most}} commonly used method for the treatment of paediatric hydrocephalus. Despite improved shunts and surgical techniques there are still complications. This retrospective study focuses on diagnoses and treatment of shunt malfunction and infections. Cost/benefit of using an adjustable shunt was assessed. Two adjustable cerebrospinal fluid shunts and their compatible <b>antisiphon</b> devices were compared in-vitro. In 21 of 46 children the standard shunt was changed to an adjustable one due to over-drainage. Adjustment of the shunt was performed in 73 % of the children thereby avoiding surgery in several cases. This was a financial advantage. Ascites or an abdominal pseudocyst without infection was detected in eight children due to resorption difficulties. A ventriculo-atrial shunt was inserted for a period of time. In three children it could successfully be reverted to a ventriculo-peritoneal. In six children papilloedema was the only sign of shunt dysfunction. At revision the intracranial pressure ranged from 25 to 52 cm H 2 O. Fundoscopic examination in children older than 8 years may detect symptomless shunt malfunction. During a 13 -year period 39 shunt infections were diagnosed. Skin bacteria were found in 80 %. Prolonged and anaerobic cultures increased the detection rate by more than one third. The intraventricular infections were treated with intraventricular and systemic antibiotics resulting in quick sterilisation. No relapses were encountered. In five older children with distal catheter infection Propionibacterium acne was found. These were treated with intravenous antibiotics and exchanging of the shunt system. Strata NSCTM and Codman HakimTM worked according to the manufacturers except at the lowest setting. The resistance was below and in the lower range of the physiological one respectively. The <b>antisiphon</b> device of Strata shunt had to be placed in line with shunt to function properly...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although about 80 % of {{properly}} diagnosed {{patients with}} hydrocephalus improve after implantation of any model of shunt, the remaining 20 % may develop further complications because of inadequate shunt performance. Therefore, hydrocephalus shunts require careful independent laboratory evaluation. METHOD: Computer supported shunt testing, {{based on the}} new International Standard Organisation directives, characterises various aspects of pressure-flow performance of shunts such as variability with time, susceptibility to reflux, siphoning, temperature related behaviour, external pressure, {{the influence of a}} strong magnetic field (for example, MRI), presence of pulsation in differential pressure, particles in drained fluid, etc. RESULTS: Seven different models of valves, representing most common constructions, have been tested so far. Most contemporary valves have a hydrodynamic resistance which is too low. This may result in overdrainage both related to posture and during nocturnal cerebral vasogenic waves. A long distal catheter increases the resistance of these valves by 100 %- 200 %. Most shunts are very sensitive to the presence of air bubbles and small particles in drained fluid. Few shunt models offer reasonable resistance to negative outlet pressure, preventing complications related to overdrainage. Valves with an <b>antisiphon</b> device may be blocked by raised subcutaneous pressure. All programmable valves are susceptible to overdrainage in an upright position. CONCLUSION: The behaviour of a valve during such testing is of immediate relevance to the surgeon and may not be adequately described in the manufacturer's product information...|$|E
40|$|Fossil, facies, and isotope {{analyses}} {{of an early}} high-paleolatitude (55 °S) section suggests a highly unstable East Antarctic Ice Sheet from 32 to 27 Myr. The waxing and waning of this ice sheet from 140 % to 40 % of its present volume caused sea level changes of ± 25 m (ranging from - 30 to + 50 m) related to periodic glacial (100, 000 to 200, 000 years) and shorter interglacial events. The near-field Gippsland sea level (GSL) curve shares many similarities to the far-field New Jersey sea level (NJSL) estimates. However, there are possible resolution errors due to biochronology, taphonomy, and paleodepth estimates and the relative lack of lowstand deposits (in NJSL) that prevent detailed correlations with GSL. Nevertheless, the lateral variations in sea level between the GSL section and NJSL record that suggest ocean siphoning and <b>antisiphoning</b> may have propagated synchronous yet variable sea levels...|$|R
40|$|Background: Sophisticated shunt valves {{provide the}} {{possibility}} of pressure adjustment and <b>antisiphon</b> control but {{have a higher probability}} of valve dysfunction especially in a posthemorrhagic setting. The aim of the present study is to analyze the clinical outcome of patients with shunt dependent posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus after aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in order to identify patients who would benefit from a simple differential pressure valve. Methods: From 2000 to 2013, 547 patients with aneurysmatic SAH were treated at our institution, 114 underwent ventricular shunt placement (21. 1 %). 47 patients with available pre- and post-operative computed tomography scans, and an available follow-up of minimum 6 months were included. In order to measure the survival time which a nonprogrammable differential pressure valve would have had in an individual patient we defined the initial equalized shunt survival time (IESS). IESS is the time until surgical revisions of fixed differential pressure or flow-regulated valves for the treatment of over- or under-drainage as well as re-programming of adjustable valves due to over- or under-drainage. Results: Twenty patients were treated with fixed differential pressure valves, 15 patients were treated with flow-regulated valves, and 12 underwent ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement with differential pressure valves assisted by a gravitational unit. Patients who reacted with remarkable changes of the ventricular width after the insertion of external ventricular drainage (EVD), before shunt placement, showed a significantly longer IESS. Conclusions: Decline of the ventricular width after EVD placement was a predictor for successful VP shunt therapy in the later course of disease. Possibly, this could allow identifying patients who benefit from a simple differential pressure valve or a flow-regulated valve, and thus could possibly avoid valve-associated complications of a programmable valve in the later course of disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} was to assess CSF dynamics of different shunt constructions in patients with adult hydrocephalus syndrome and correlate these findings to clinical outcome, neuroradiology, and the specifications of the shunts provided by the manufacturer. Thirty four patients with idiopathic adult hydrocephalus (normal pressure hydrocephalus) syndrome were included in a prospective, consecutive case series. A differential pressure valve (Cordis Hakim standard system) was used in 28 patients and a variable resistance valve (Cordis Orbis-Sigma) in six. A constant pressure infusion method was used; CSF pressure and conductance were determined before surgery. Three months after shunt placement CSF pressure, the "pressure v flow" curve, and gravity induced flow were measured. There {{was no difference between}} mean preoperative and postoperative resting CSF pressures in patients with Hakim shunts. The opening pressures of the Hakim shunts were higher than the value proposed by the manufacturer. A pronounced gravity effect induced CSF flow and decrease of the CSF pressure. In functioning variable resistance valves, CSF dynamics normalised postoperatively. There was no gravity effect and the characteristics shaped "pressure v flow" curve was sometimes seen. Six patients (three differential pressure valves, three variable resistance valves) had non-functioning shunts. Four of these patients were improved after the operation but improvement was transient in three. In all patients, there was no relation between the width of the ventricles and clinical improvement or CSF pressure. In conclusion, the differential pressure valve system does not behave according to the specifications provided by the manufacturer. A decrease in CSF pressure in patients with this shunt was solely due to the effect of gravity. Eleven percent of the differential pressure valves and 50 % of the variable resistance valves were non-functioning. In the functioning variable resistance valves, the <b>antisiphon</b> system seems to be effective...|$|E
