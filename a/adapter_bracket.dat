5000|$|Rack slides are {{specifically}} intended for mounting equipment into 19-inch racks or 23-inch racks. These can be friction bearing, ball bearing, or roller bearing. They are sized {{to fit into}} racks with mounting flanges on the ends to mate to the mounting holes in racks. In some cases, one mounting flange is formed into the rack slide with an <b>adapter</b> <b>bracket</b> attached {{to the other end}} to accommodate different depths of the rack. The outer fixed member is attached to the rack and the inner moving member is generally screwed {{to the side of the}} mounted equipment. Rack slides are typically compound or 3-part slides allowing full extension of the mounted equipment and generally include provision for sliding the inner member completely free to allow removal of the equipment from the rack. They can also include stops to prevent accidentally pulling the equipment out of the rack without releasing the stop mechanism.|$|E
40|$|Apparatus for {{adapting}} {{a general}} purpose and effector device {{to a special}} purpose and effector is disclosed which includes an <b>adapter</b> <b>bracket</b> assembly which provides a mechanical and electrical interface between the end effector devices. The <b>adapter</b> <b>bracket</b> assembly includes an adapter connector post which interlocks with a diamond shaped gripping channel formed in closed jaws of the general purpose end effector. The angularly intersecting surfaces of the connector post and gripping channel prevent any relative movement there between. Containment webs constrain the outer finger plates of the general purpose jaws to prevent pitch motion. Electrical interface is provided by conical, self aligning electrical connector components carried by respective ones of said end effectors...|$|E
