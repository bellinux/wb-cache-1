40|$|Voracity {{and feeding}} {{preferences}} of <b>adult</b> <b>Coccinella</b> <b>septempunctata</b> L. and Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae, tribe Coccinellini) were evaluated {{in the laboratory}} on a common prey, the spirea aphid, Aphis citricola van der Goot (Homoptera: Aphididae), and on the twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acarina: Tetranychidae), a prey previously unrecorded for these two predators. The experiments were {{carried out in the}} laboratory on apple saplings (Malus domestica Borkhausen). Adult males and females of H. axyridis consumed significantly more mites than adults of C. septempunctata. For H. axyridis, males consumed 41. 3 spider mites in 24 h and females 48. 4, whereas for C. septempunctata males consumed 14. 1 prey and females 15. 2. The consumption of spirea aphids by the males was similar for the two species. Consumption by the females was significantly greater for H. axyridis (46. 5) than for C. septempunctata (22. 2). The two coccinellids showed a significant preference for A. citricola in the presence of T. urticae. This preference was more pronounced for C. septempunctata. The total number of prey consumed and the percentage of exploited biomass decreased significantly for C. septempunctata and stayed relatively constant for H. axyridis as the number of mites increased in the prey ratio. Our results suggest that T. urticae is only an alternative prey for both predators, and that H. axyridis should be more efficient than C. septempunctata in a prey assemblage with aphids and mites...|$|E
40|$|Results are {{reported}} {{of a field}} and laboratory study {{on the influence of}} <b>adult,</b> coccinellid predators <b>Coccinella</b> <b>septempunctata</b> (L.) and braconid parasitoids Aphidius rhopalosiphi deStefani-Perez on the spread of barley yellow dwarf virus by bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi (L.)) and English grain aphid (Sitobion avenae (F.)). Barley yellow dwarf (BYD) is the most widespread and economically important disease of cereals world wide (Plumb 1983).

40|$|The {{effects of}} within-species plant {{genotype}} mixing on the habitat preference of a polyphagous ladybird were studied. Plant species diversity is often claimed to positively affect habitat preferences of insect predators, but {{the effects of}} within-species genotype diversity have not been extensively studied. In a field experiment with different barley (Hordeum vulgare) genotypes in mixed and pure stands, <b>adult</b> seven-spot ladybird <b>Coccinella</b> <b>septempunctata,</b> a polyphagous predator, preferred a specific combination of genotypes over the single genotypes alone before aphids {{had arrived in the}} crop, and again when aphids were emigrating. In laboratory experiments on adult ladybird orientation to odour from barley, ladybirds were attracted/arrested by the mixed odour of the same barley genotype mixture that was preferred in the field. Exposure of one barley genotype to volatiles from the other also caused the odour of the exposed plants to become more attractive to ladybirds. The results support the hypothesis that plant volatiles may attract or arrest foraging adult ladybirds, contributing to the selection of favourable habitats, and they show that within-species plant genotype mixing can shape interactions within multitrophic communities...|$|R

In general results of these studies confirmed the results of previous work comparing foraging behavior on a smaller spatial scale in Petri dishes. However, behaviors were modified in response to spatial complexity, prey quality, and the host plant. Starved C. septempunctata adults and larvae fed for longer and consumed more aphids than non-starved coccinellids. Both larvae and adults fed on infected aphids and in some cases entirely consumed them. This was thought to be due to the ease of capture of infected (dead) aphids and the feeding stimuli provided by the presence of the host plant and, where there was a choice of prey, uninfected aphids in the environment. Both larvae and adults spent the majority of the time foraging in the upper regions of plants and visited more plants when they were not starved or when they were {{in the presence of}} less suitable, infected aphid prey...|$|R

The beetles were kept alone, paired with conspecifics or paired with heterospecifics, and presented with potato aphids (Macrosiphum euphorbiae).

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the intraguild predation behaviour of three ladybird species (<b>Coccinella</b> <b>septempunctata,</b> Adalia bipunctata, and H. axyridis). Predation behaviour was investigated in semi-field experiments on small lime trees (Tilia platyphyllos). Two fourth-instar larvae placed on a tree rarely made contact during 3 -hour observations. When placed together on a single leaf in 23 %– 43 % of the observations at least one contact was made. Of those contacts 0 %– 27 % resulted in an attack. Harmonia axyridis attacked mostly heterospecifics, while A. bipunctata and C. septempunctata attacked heterospecifics as often as conspecifics.
