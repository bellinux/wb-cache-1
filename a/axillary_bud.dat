This monopodial character may be exhibited by prostrate, trunkless, and trunk-forming members. Some common palms restricted to solitary growth include Washingtonia and Roystonea. Palms may instead grow in sparse though dense clusters. The trunk develops an <b>axillary</b> <b>bud</b> at a leaf node, usually near the base, from which a new shoot emerges. The new shoot, in turn, produces an <b>axillary</b> <b>bud</b> and a clustering habit results. Exclusively sympodial genera include many of the rattans, Guihaia, and Rhapis. Several palm genera have both solitary and clustering members. Palms which are usually solitary may grow in clusters, and vice versa.

50|$|<b>Axillary</b> <b>buds</b> do {{not become}} {{actively}} growing shoots on plants with strong apical dominance (the tendency to grow just the terminal bud on the main stem). Apical dominance occurs because the shoot apical meristem produces auxin which prevents <b>axillary</b> <b>buds</b> from growing. The <b>axillary</b> <b>buds</b> begin developing when {{they are exposed to}} less auxin, for example if the plant naturally has weak apical dominance, if apical dominance is broken by removing the terminal bud, or if the terminal bud has grown far enough away for the auxin to have less of an effect.|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} in vitro grafting of Theobroma cacao where seedlings of the UF 677 genotype {{were used as}} the rootstock and apices or <b>axillary</b> <b>buds</b> of a Trinitarian genotype were used as scion. Three methods of grafting using scions from seedlings were evaluated. Apical grafts using apex and side grafts using apex displayed better graft success (95 and 80 %, respectively). However, side grafts using <b>axillary</b> <b>buds</b> reached a greater height on average and a higher number of leaves per plant (1. 76  cm and 3. 72, respectively). Histological studies revealed new vascular elements at the graft union area. Side grafts with <b>axillary</b> <b>buds</b> provided the highest survival rate (82 %) after the acclimatization step. A shoot of at least 1  cm with two leaves is required for plant survival after transfer to ex vitro conditions. Side grafting was carried out with <b>axillary</b> <b>buds</b> from adult trees and nursery plants. Only the grafts with buds from nursery grafted plants were successful, with a rate of 26 %. Overall, side grafting with <b>axillary</b> <b>buds</b> is the most appropriate method for cacao micrografting.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the origin and to observe the development of <b>axillary</b> <b>buds</b> in Phaseolus limensis (lima beans). Plant morphologists have long been interested in the mode of origin of <b>axillary</b> <b>buds.</b> The ferns, grasses, and woody plants have been studied most extensively. There was confusion as to whether <b>axillary</b> <b>buds</b> originated from the subtending leaf, the leaf above, the main shoot, or from detached apical meristem. All situations were found to occur,Since not much work had been done on <b>axillary</b> <b>buds</b> in this plant, lima beans were chosen. It is necessary to study the anatomy of the embryo as wellas growing plants in order to obtain a complete picture of development. The accessibility of the embryo and the growth form adapt this plant well to such study. For this study, Phaseolus limensis seeds were soaked and allowed to germinate. Materials were collected at definite intervals throughout the growth of the plant. The material was killed, fixed, thin sectioned, mounted on slides, and stained differentially. A comparison of the sequential sections was made in order to follow the morphogenesis of the <b>axillary</b> <b>buds</b> and to observe the accompanying morphological and cytological changes.

40|$|The {{influence}} of cytokinin on auxin transport during release of <b>axillary</b> <b>buds</b> from apical dominance was studied. Expression of auxin-carrier coding genes PsAUX 1 (AUXIN RESISTANT 1) and PsPIN 1 (PIN-FORMED 1) was explored in <b>axillary</b> <b>buds</b> of the 2 nd node of 7 -day pea plants (Pisum sativum L.) cv. Vladan after decapitation or after exogenous application of benzyladenine (6 -benzylaminopurine) onto <b>axillary</b> <b>buds</b> of intact plants. Localization of the PsPIN 1 protein, {{the key factor}} for polar transport of auxin in <b>axillary</b> <b>buds,</b> was visualised by immunohistochemistry. After exogenous application of cytokinin the expression of PsAUX 1 and PsPIN 1 rapidly increased with a simultaneous rapid decrease in PsDRM 1 and PsAD 1 expression – genes related to bud dormancy. The same changes in expression were observed after decapitation, however they were markedly slower. The PsPIN 1 auxin efflux carrier in the inhibited <b>axillary</b> <b>buds</b> of intact plants was localised in a non-polar manner. After exogenous application of cytokinin gradual polarisation of the PsPIN 1 protein occurred on the basal pole of polar auxin transport competent cells. Despite the fact that direct auxin application to buds of intact plants led {{to an increase in}} PsAUX 1 and PsPIN 1 expression, the buds remained dormant (non-growing) what was accompanied by persistent expression of the dormancy markers PsDRM 1 and PsAD 1. The results indicate a possible effect of cytokinins on biosynthesis, and/or transport of auxin in <b>axillary</b> <b>buds</b> and they highlight the importance of auxin-cytokinin crosstalk in the regulation of bud outgrowth after breaking of apical dominance...|$|R
