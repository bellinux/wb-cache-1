The {{purpose of this}} research is to obtain model estimation best fit over 90 %. Furthermore, the purpose {{of this research is}} to design controllers which the overshoot percentage close to zero percent and obtain a shorter rise time compare to current hot <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> system. The research divided into 3 area of focus, first focus on the development of Pseudo-Random Binary Sequences (PRBS) controller prototype to use as a System Identification Tool. The development of the controller was designed using PIC controllers. Testing was being conducted to ensure the controller is fully operational. Next, the output data from the hot <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> system (HABS) was captured for analysis. Second, the research focused on the modeling of <b>a</b> hot <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> system using System Identification and Estimation approach. By obtaining the mathematical model of <b>a</b> hot <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> system, tuning can be made possible. The output data was being run on MATLAB to compare between several of model structures. Model structures selected for this research are Auto-Regressive with eXogeneous inputs (ARX), Auto-Regressive Moving-Average with eXogeneous inputs (ARMAX), Output Error (OE) and Box–Jenkins (BJ). Result shows the eXogeneous inputs (ARX) obtained the highest best fit which best resemble the dynamic system of <b>a</b> hot <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> system (HABS) and was selected to be implemented in the controllers. Third area of focus is the simulation design of controllers; controllers which were selected for this research were PID controllers, Self-tuning controllers and Fuzzy controllers.

In this paper, we developed <b>a</b> synthetic jet <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> to supply <b>a</b> high stoichiometric <b>air</b> flow. The synthetic jet mechanism is a zero mass flux device that converts electrical energy into the momentum. The synthetic jet actuation is usually generated by a traditional PZT actuator, which consists of a small cylindrical cavity, in/outlet channel and PZT diaphragms. The flow rate of the fabricated synthetic jet <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> was 400 cc/min at 550 Hz and its power consumption was very low under 0. 3 W.

5000|$|One {{treatment}} for obstructive hypopnea is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP is a treatment {{in which the}} patient wears a mask over the nose and/or mouth. <b>An</b> <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> forces air through the upper airway. The air pressure is adjusted {{so that it is}} just enough to maintain the oxygen saturation levels in the blood. Another treatment is sometimes a custom fitted oral appliance. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's protocol for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) recommends oral appliances for those who prefer them to CPAP and have mild to moderate sleep apnea or those that do not respond to/cannot wear a CPAP. Severe cases of OSA may be treated with an oral appliance if the patient has had a trial run with a CPAP. Oral Appliances should be custom made by a dentist with training in dental sleep medicine. [...] Mild obstructive hypopnea can often be treated by losing weight or by avoiding sleeping on one's back. Also quitting smoking, and avoiding alcohol, sedatives and hypnotics (soporifics) before sleep can be quite effective. Surgery is generally a last resort in hypopnea treatment, but is a site-specific option for the upper airway. Depending on the cause of obstruction, surgery may focus on the soft palate, the uvula, tonsils, adenoids or the tongue. There are also more complex surgeries that are performed with the adjustment of other bone structures - the mouth, nose and facial bones.|$|E

Proper rotation in these kinds of composting machines is an efficient technique which produces uniform end product due to good agitation, aeration and mixing of the compost (Rich and Bharti 2015).

40|$|This study explores {{a method}} of {{generating}} electricity while recovering waste heat through the integration of heat pipes and thermoelectric generators (i. e. HPTEG system). The simultaneous waste heat recovery and power generation processes are achieved {{without the use of}} any moving parts. The HPTEG system consists of bismuth telluride thermoelectric generators (TEG), which are sandwiched between two finned pipes to achieve a temperature gradient across the TEG for electricity generation. A counter-flow heat exchanger was built using two separate air ducts. The air ducts were thermally coupled using the HPTEG modules. The evaporator section of the heat pipe absorbed the waste heat in a hot air duct. The heat was then transferred across the TEG surfaces. The condenser section of the HPTEG collected the excess heat from the TEG cold side before releasing it to the cold air duct. A 2 -kW electrical heater was installed in the hot air duct to simulate the exhaust gas. <b>An</b> <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> was installed at the inlet of each duct to direct the flow of air into the ducts.
