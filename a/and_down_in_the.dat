5|$|Since the Victorian era the Thames {{has been}} {{extensively}} embanked, {{and many of its}} London tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding. The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level by the slow 'tilting' of Britain (up in the north <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south) caused by post-glacial rebound.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field {{is one of}} heteroscedastic fluctuation. An instantaneous measurement of it, or several measurements of it across the span of decades or centuries, are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in the field strength. It has gone up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past for unknown reasons. Also, noting the local intensity of the dipole field (or its fluctuation) is insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not strictly a dipole field. The dipole component of Earth's field can diminish even while the total magnetic field remains the same or increases.|$|E

25|$|The proprietors of the Kennet and Avon Canal Company had {{inspected}} Weldon's {{device and}} recommended {{it to the}} adjoining Somerset Coal Canal for use at Combe Hay on their new line, to overcome water supply problems there. (The Somerset Coal Canal led directly to the Kennet and Avon {{and it was in}} the latter company's interest that the new route be opened as quickly as possible.) Three such locks were proposed, each to be 80ft (24.3m)long and 60ft (18.2m) deep and containing a closed wooden box which could take the boat. This box moved up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 60ft (18.2m) deep pool of water, which never left the lock.|$|E
25|$|Gillnets {{existed in}} ancient times as archaeological {{evidence}} from the Middle East demonstrates. In North America, Native American fishermen used cedar canoes and natural fibre nets, e.g., made with nettles or the inner bark of cedar. They would attach stones {{to the bottom of}} the nets as weights, and pieces of wood to the top, to use as floats. This allowed the net to suspend straight up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water. Each net would be suspended either from shore or between two boats. Native fishers in the Pacific Northwest, Canada, and Alaska still commonly use gillnets in their fisheries for salmon and steelhead.|$|E
25|$|A round {{drilling}} edge is used, {{being the}} size of a drinking bowl, while the depth of the borehole amounts to several tens of zhang. Large bamboo stems are used with the septa removed and fitted together by male-female joints to form the well, thus keeping the fresh water out so that the salty spring water comes up by itself. Smaller bamboo tubes are also used which travel up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wells as buckets. They have no bottom, but an orifice is mounted at the top. A piece of leather of several inches in size is hung up. As the tubes go {{in and out of the}} brine, the air pushes and sucks, closing and opening the leather valve. Each tube brings up several dou of brine… Where profit is to be had, people do not fail to know about it.|$|E

25|$|Thereafter, the {{government}} began a campaign of repression targeted against the United Irishmen, including executions, routine use of torture, transportation to penal colonies and house burnings. As the repression began to bite, the United Irishmen {{decided to go ahead}} with an insurrection without French help. Their activity culminated in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. When the central core of the plan, an uprising in Dublin, failed, the rebellion then spread in an apparently random fashion firstly around Dublin, then briefly in Kildare, Meath, Carlow and Wicklow. County Wexford in the southeast then saw the most sustained fighting of the rebellion, to be briefly joined by rebels who took to the field in Antrim <b>and</b> <b>Down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north. A small French force landed in Killala Bay in Mayo leading to a last outbreak of rebellion in counties Mayo, Leitrim and Longford. The rebellion lasted just three months before it was suppressed, but claimed an estimated 30,000 lives. Being the largest outburst of violence in modern Ireland, 1798 looms heavily in collective memory and was commemorated extensively in its centennial and bicentennial anniversaries.|$|E
500|$|Tracy was {{prone to}} bouts of {{depression}} and anxiety: he was described by Mrs. Tracy as having [...] "the most volatile disposition I've ever seen—up in the clouds one minute <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> depths the next. And when he's low, he's very, very low." [...] He was plagued by insomnia throughout his life. As a result, Tracy became dependent on barbiturates to sleep, followed by dexedrine to function. Hepburn, who adopted a nursing role towards Tracy, was unable to understand her partner's unhappiness. She wrote in her autobiography: [...] "What was it?... Never at peace... Tortured by some sort of guilt. Some terrible misery." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{potential}} {{solution to}} the water supply problem {{was the use of}} caisson locks as proposed by Robert Weldon, three of which could replace the 22conventional locks, because it wasted no water, however the technology had only been tried in a one-third scale prototype. Each lock was [...] long and [...] deep and contained a closed wooden box which could take a barge.

2500|$|Around 1800 {{the use of}} caisson locks was {{proposed}} by Robert Weldon for the Somerset Coal Canal in England. In this underwater lift, the chamber was 80ft long and [...] deep and contained a completely enclosed wooden box big enough to take a barge. This box moved up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> [...] deep pool of water. Apart from inevitable leakage, the water never left the chamber, and using the lock wasted no water. Instead, the boat entered the box and was sealed in by the door closing behind it, and the box itself was moved up or down through the water. When the box {{was at the bottom}} of the chamber, it was under almost [...] of water [...] at a pressure of three atmospheres, in total. One of these [...] "locks" [...] was built and demonstrated to the Prince Regent (later George IV), but it had various engineering problems and the design was not put into use on the Coal Canal.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{microphones}} did {{not produce}} intelligible speech, until Alexander Graham Bell made improvements including a variable-resistance microphone/transmitter. [...] Bell's liquid transmitter consisted of a metal cup filled with water {{with a small amount}} of sulfuric acid added. A sound wave caused the diaphragm to move, forcing a needle to move up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water. The electrical resistance between the wire and the cup was then inversely proportional to the size of the water meniscus around the submerged needle. [...] Elisha Gray filed a caveat for a version using a brass rod instead of the needle. [...] Other minor variations and improvements were made to the liquid microphone by Majoranna, Chambers, Vanni, Sykes, and Elisha Gray, and one version was patented by Reginald Fessenden in 1903. These were the first working microphones, but they were not practical for commercial application. [...] The famous first phone conversation between Bell and Watson took place using a liquid microphone.|$|E
2500|$|A {{major league}} team's Director of Player Development determines where a given player {{will be placed}} in the farm system, in {{coordination}} with the coaches and managers who evaluate their talent. [...] At the end of spring training, players both from the spring major camp and minor league winter camp are placed by the major league club on the roster of a minor league team. The Director of Player Development and the general manager usually determine the initial assignments for new draftees, who typically begin playing professionally in June after they have been signed to contracts. The farm system is ever-changing, and evaluation of players is a constantly ongoing process. The Director of Player Development and his managers meet or teleconference regularly to discuss how players are performing at each level. Personal development, injuries, and high levels of achievement by players in the classes below all steer a player's movement up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> class system.|$|E
2500|$|The tower has thirty two lifts for tenants to use, where 8 lifts serve roughly ten {{floors of}} the building. All tenant {{passenger}} lifts serve the ground floor and the following groups of floors – floors 5–17, floors 18–28, floors 28–39 and floors 39–50 (note that level 5 is the first office floor {{and there is no}} level 13). In addition there are 2 firemen's lifts which serve all floors in the building. These have colour designations with blue being in the northeast core of the building and green being in the southwest. From the building's initial construction until late 2009 there were 2 large freight lifts at which point another was added. This lift was built inside a vacant lift shaft and has the designation GL37 (GL for goods lift and 37 as it is the 37th lift in the building). The tower uses 'Gearless Traction Elevators' by Otis. [...] These lifts were installed in 1990 (aside from GL37 – 2009) using a gearless traction machine. [...] They have woven steel cables called hoisting ropes that are attached {{to the top of the}} lift cabin and wrapped around the drive sheave in special grooves. The other ends of the cables are attached to a counterweight that moves up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hoistway on its own guiderails. It takes 40 seconds by lift from lobby to top floor (The Canary Wharf website has not been updated to include the new goods lift GL37).|$|E
