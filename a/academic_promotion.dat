40|$|Sound {{management}} practice requires that administrative decisions affecting <b>academic</b> staff <b>promotions</b> reflect systematic, uniformly applied, fair, and valid evaluations of performance. To meet these requirements, a performance evaluation criteria and procedures must {{be put in}} place to reflect two decision elements: what will be evaluated, and how the evaluation will be made. This paper reviews literature regarding the three main criteria (Teaching, Research and Publication and Service to the Community) for <b>academic</b> staff <b>promotion</b> evaluation and how the modalities and procedures of <b>academic</b> staff <b>promotions</b> could create fertile ground for conflict to erupt. The paper reveals that academic staff face their evaluation with anxiety. However, the implementation and processing of <b>academic</b> staff <b>promotions</b> are interfaced with challenges. It is concluded that both faculty and administration should cherish the ideal methods and purposes of faculty assessment. Among other things, the paper recommends that administration/management should institute a data-based academic staff performance evaluation programme; specifically oriented toward such administrative actions as promotions. As a sequel, management/administration should robustly enlighten academic staff on their promotion modalities and procedures...|$|R

5000|$|In 1905, {{he played}} an {{important}} role in the creation of a Slavic languages department at the University of Iași. As seen by historian Radu Mârza, he was ambitious and vain, desirous of <b>academic</b> <b>promotion,</b> and determined to eclipse his former professor, Ioan Bogdan, who held a similar post at Bucharest. (The latter always denied he was in competition with his former student.) Bărbulescu's objective was to secure a far more prestigious job than the one he held at the archive. He had failed to obtain a position teaching old Romanian literature at Bucharest, and Bogdan had not offered his assistance. Bărbulescu then turned his attention to Iași, probably having been informed that discussion about a new department was underway. Around that time, as a distinguished member of the local Conservative club, he also replaced the defunct Spiru Prasin at the helm of Evenimentul newspaper. Being overwhelmed by his scholarly work, he failed to maintain its profile, and he was later replaced by Emil Severin, in turn replaced by Rudolf Șuțu.|$|E
5000|$|Edward Bentham's {{appointment}} to the Oxford regius professorship of Divinity took place in May or June 1763, {{following the death of}} the previous incumbent, John Fanshawe. The professorship came with an automatic entitlement to a canonry at Christ Church: unfortunately, however, the eighth prebendary chair to which this canonry entitled him was lower in the Christ Church cathedral hierarchy than the fifth prebendary chair which Bentham had up till now occupied since 1754. [...] In this sense, it was impossible to avoid the observation that elevation to the regius professorship represented not merely an <b>academic</b> <b>promotion</b> but also a canonical demotion. [...] In this context the Archbishop of Canterbury supplied a critique of the appointment (which he had himself recommended to the king and energetically encouraged Bentham to accept) in a letter written to the Archbishop of York on 31 May 1763: [...] "I am sorry for poor Bentham, but I am glad for the University". It is also reported that Edward Bentham's brother, the church historian James Bentham, saw the regius professorship as a step along the way to further ecclesiastical promotion; but in the event Edward Bentham was still serving as the Oxford University regius professor of Divinity when he died more than thirteen years later, in October 1776.|$|E

Candidates {{are more likely to}} be promoted when they are evaluated by an acquainted evaluator. The source of this premium depends on the nature of their relationship. Candidates promoted by a weak link turn out to be more productive in the future relative to other promoted candidates, suggesting that informational gains dominate potential evaluation biases. On the contrary, candidates promoted by a strong connection exhibit a worse research record both before and after the evaluation.
