25|$|The {{conception}} that {{an action}} for conversion lies only for tangible property {{capable of being}} identified and taken into <b>actual</b> <b>possession</b> {{is based on a}} fiction by which the action of trover was founded, namely, that the defendant had found the property of another, which was lost. This conception has become, in the progress of the law, something without meaning which has been discarded by most courts. Therefore, it has been generally accepted that an action for conversion lies for every species of personal property which is the subject of private ownership, whether animate or inanimate. Intangible property can be the subject of a conversion in the United States. There cannot be an action in conversion for choses in action or mere debt. Computer software can be the subject of a conversion.|$|E
25|$|Though Knoop {{of course}} {{had been only}} four {{at the time of}} the battle, so he had no {{personal}} knowledge, he could avail himself of the recollections of many Dutch veterans who had been there, and as a general-staff member he had access to the after-battle reports the Dutch units had made within two days after the battle ended. (These archived reports could have been made available to Siborne, and in one case he appears to have been in <b>actual</b> <b>possession</b> of one, but he never bothered to consult them). As a trained historian, Knoop now started to research these sources and wrote a detailed repudiation of Siborne's book based on all these sources. This book (published with the explicit consent of King William II as a semi-official rebuttal), was received with much enthusiasm in Dutch military circles. When soon thereafter there was a false rumor in the Dutch press that captain Siborne was on his way to demand satisfaction, no less than six officers of horse-artillery spontaneoulsy offered to act as Knoop's seconds, if necessary. But Siborne stayed safely in England.|$|E

According to one source King Edward had been told by Pope Boniface VIII to install Thomas as bishop, Edward proceeded to judge the matter for himself. After doing so, and having received Thomas' oath of fealty, King Edward ordered John de Warrene, the Earl of Surrey, to install Thomas into his episcopal temporalities.|$|E

This agreement, signed partly to legitimize British control of Singapore, and also to settle outstanding issues between the British and Dutch following the Napoleonic Wars, effectively divided the Malay world down the Straits of Melaka. It gave the Dutch Sumatra and the islands to the south of the Straits of Singapore, while the British received the Malay Peninsula and Singapore Island.

5000|$|Economic {{and social}} life in medieval Penkridge were enacted within the manor, the basic {{territorial}} unit of feudal society, which regulated {{the economic and social}} relationships of its members and enforced the law on them. The manor was sometimes co-extensive with the village, but not always. Penkridge was initially a royal manor, a situation that still had real meaning in 1086, when Domesday found that the king had land and a mill at Penkridge being directly worked for him by a small team. The situation changed, probably in the 12th century, when one of the kings gave it as a fief to the Hose or Hussey family, paving the way for its subsequent grant to Archbishop Henry de Loundres, who divided it into lay and deanery manors for his family and ecclesiastical successors respectively. This did not go unchallenged, and the Husseys raised claims to Penkridge occasionally until the 16th century - a lingering dispute typical of feudal land tenure - although their <b>actual</b> <b>possessions</b> shrank to a couple of small holdings at Wolgarston. Penkridge manor and the Deanery Manor were {{by no means the only}} manors within Penkridge parish. In fact, there were many, of various sizes and tenures.

The lessees did not take up <b>actual</b> <b>possession</b> of the land. The first lease was forfeited for non-payment of rent in 1918. A second lease was granted in 1919. The new lessee also did not take up possession. The lease was surrendered in 1921. Each lease was issued for pastoral purposes. Since 1922 the land had been reserved for the benefit of Aboriginals. Both the Wik people and the Thayorre People made claims over the area.|$|E
2500|$|An agent {{entrusted}} by {{a principal}} with {{the possession of}} goods is generally recognized as having a sufficient interest in the goods to enable him to maintain an action against a third person for a conversion. [...] Some jurisdictions hold that the agent must {{have more than a}} mere right of possession. [...] A similar result has been reached where the servant left the property in the possession of the defendant, who subsequently converted it. [...] Where a sheriff attached chattels and delivered them for safekeeping to a person, the person was merely the sheriff's servant, and having no interest in the chattels, could not maintain an action for their conversion. Causes of action for conversion are generally assignable, so that the action may be instituted by the assignee. An officer in possession of property may ignore a conversion of the same by a wrongdoer and proceed to sell the property on execution, the purchaser then being permitted to sue the wrongdoer for the conversion of the property. A transferee of personal property, or interest therein, who acquires the right of possession by or through the transfer, may maintain an action for a conversion committed after the transfer, though he has not yet received <b>actual</b> <b>possession</b> of the goods. A creditor, having no interest, generally may not be a plaintiff in an action to retrieve a debtor's converted property. An owner of land may bring an action in conversion, but he must be in material possession of the land and of the property severed from the land {{at the time of the}} conversion.|$|E

If the dance and music are pleasing, the bansa are believed to take <b>actual</b> <b>possession</b> of the dancers, whereupon the wali jinn will assist in releasing them {{at the end of}} the dance. The bansa are not feared, however, as they are regarded as actual spirits of ancestors.

2500|$|His written work, De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae (The Laws and Customs of England), was {{composed}} primarily before c. 1235. Most {{of the text}} was likely written by William of Raleigh and was then passed along to Bracton, who was his clerk. Bracton's contribution was largely to update the text to include, for example, changes made in the provisions of Merton in 1236. However, {{the true nature of}} Bracton's work is not clear. Pollock, Maitland, and Plucknett credit the work more to Bracton and less to the influence of Raleigh. These scholars date the work to a later time, closer to 1260. The work was never completed. According to these authors, the Second Barons' War ended the writing. Bracton had access to (or <b>actual</b> <b>possession</b> of) many rolls of recorded law cases from the King's court. These were called plea rolls and were usually not publicly available. It is probable he was forced to surrender these before his book was finished. Even in its unfinished state, it is the most thorough English medieval law book. He also likely had access to the cases of Martin Pateshull and William Raleigh, his mentors in the law. A notebook containing 2000 cases from Pateshull and Raleigh has been deemed to be Bracton's. This book contains notes written in the margin that are in Bracton's handwriting. He incorporated the information from these cases in his book. Bracton also studied noted Italian lawyer Azo of Bologna. He was familiar with Corpus Iuris Civilis (Body of [...] Civil Law), the Decretum and the Decretals, as well as the works of the canonist Tancred of Bologna. He became familiar with, and an advocate of the Latin concept of Universal Law or Natural Moral Law, based on his reading of these sources. Bracton would have been familiar with the description of natural moral law applied in the Decretals: [...] "The natural law dates from the creation of the rational creature. It does not vary with time, but remains unchangeable." [...] He also was familiar with Isidore of Seville or Isidorus Hispalensis (c. 570–636) who wrote of law: [...] "In determining the nature of law, there must be three conditions: the fostering of religion, in {{as much as it is}} proportionate to the Divine law; that it is helpful to discipline, in as much as it is proportionate to the natural law; and that is further the common weal, in as much as it is proportionate to the utility of mankind." [...] Bracton used these works as a basis for his legal philosophy. Certain Latin terms, such as [...] "corpus et animus" [...] (body and soul) being necessary for possession under the law, are seen in Bracton that would appear to be ecclesiastical in origin.|$|E
