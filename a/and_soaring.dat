5|$|The {{flight of}} the Alpine chough is swift and acrobatic with loose deep wing beats. Its high {{manoeuvrability}} is accomplished by fanning the tail, folding its wings, <b>and</b> <b>soaring</b> in the updraughts at cliff faces. Even in flight, it can be distinguished from the red-billed chough by its less rectangular wings, and longer, less square-ended tail.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Soviet Union from 1964 to 1982, {{referred}} to as the Brezhnev Era, covers the period of Leonid Brezhnev's rule of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). This period began with high economic growth <b>and</b> <b>soaring</b> prosperity, but gradually significant problems in social, political, and economic areas accumulated, so that the period is often described as the Era of Stagnation.|$|E

5|$|Castillo Armas faced {{significant}} internal resistance, {{which was}} blamed on communist agitation. The government, plagued by corruption <b>and</b> <b>soaring</b> debt, became dependent on {{aid from the}} US. In 1957 Castillo Armas was assassinated by a palace guard with leftist sympathies. He {{was the first of}} a series of authoritarian rulers in Guatemala who were close allies of the US. His reversal of the reforms of his predecessors sparked a series of leftist insurgencies in the country after his death, culminating in the Guatemalan Civil War of 1960 to 1996.|$|E
5|$|A style more melodic {{and more}} akin to the hard rock of bands like Rainbow, Magnum, UFO, Thin Lizzy and Whitesnake was equally {{represented}} during the NWOBHM. The music of Def Leppard, Praying Mantis, White Spirit, Demon, Shy, Gaskin, Dedringer and many others, contained hooks as much as riffs, often retained a closer link with blues rock, included power ballads and featured keyboards, acoustic instruments and melodic <b>and</b> <b>soaring</b> vocals. After {{the peak of the}} movement in 1981, this style was favoured by the media and gained greater acceptance among the British audience; it became prevalent when bands usually playing the more aggressive style of metal adapted to the more popular sound, which resembled that of mainstream American acts. These changes in musical direction disoriented some fans and led them to reject those bands which were perceived as having compromised key elements of their musical identity in the pursuit of success.|$|E
5|$|The Normans {{brought with}} them {{architectural}} styles from their own duchy, where austere stone churches were preferred. Under the early Norman kings this style was adapted to produce large, plain cathedrals with ribbed vaulting. During the 12th century the Anglo-Norman style became richer and more ornate, with pointed arches derived from French architecture replacing the curved Romanesque designs; this style is termed Early English Gothic and continued, with variation, {{throughout the rest of}} the Middle Ages. In the early 14th century the Perpendicular Gothic style was created in England, with an emphasis on verticality, immense windows <b>and</b> <b>soaring</b> arcades. Fine timber roofs in a variety of styles, but in particular the hammerbeam, were built in many English buildings. In the 15th century the architectural focus turned away from cathedrals and monasteries in favour of parish churches, often decorated with richly carved woodwork; in turn, these churches influenced the design of new chantry chapels for existing cathedrals.|$|E

25|$|Ballooning <b>and</b> <b>soaring</b> are not {{powered by}} muscle, {{but rather by}} {{external}} aerodynamic sources of energy: the wind and rising thermals, respectively.
