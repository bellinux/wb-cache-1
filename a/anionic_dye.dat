25|$|Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (CBB)(C45H44N3NaO7S2; mW: 825.97) is {{the most}} popular protein stain. It is an <b>anionic</b> <b>dye,</b> which non-specifically binds to proteins.

The excess dye incorporated into the gel can be removed by destaining with the same solution without the dye. The proteins are detected as blue bands on a clear background. As SDS is also anionic, it may interfere with staining process. Therefore, large volume of staining solution is recommended, at least ten times the volume of the gel.|$|E

Thus, the reactive units (CMDA) of the obtained P(CMDA-DMDAAC) s could be expected to bring about the covalent bonds with the hydroxyl groups of cotton (cellulose) to form an ether linkage when fixing, resulting in the stronger interactions of P(CMDA-DMDAAC) s with cotton fabric, as well as their electrostatic forces with <b>anionic</b> <b>dyes</b> to produce the insoluble-water color lakes, for the development of fastness of <b>anionic</b> <b>dyes</b> on cotton fabric...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{we report}} an {{approach}} for the adsorption and desorption of <b>anionic</b> (sulfonated) <b>dyes</b> from aqueous solution by doped polyaniline. In this study, we have synthesized PANI with two dopants, namely, p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) and camphorsulfonic acid (CSA), and used these to adsorb various dyes.

The adsorption of <b>anionic</b> <b>dyes</b> causes the variation in electrical conductivity of PANI, indicating its potential as a conductometric sensor for these dyes at very low concentration.

40|$|International audienceCapillary {{electrophoresis}} with photodiode array detection (CE-PDA) {{and with}} electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS) {{was used for}} the separation and the identification of 23 synthetic organic dyes, among those used in early 20 th century colour photographs such as autochromes. Both cationic and <b>anionic</b> <b>dyes</b> could be separated within 15 min using a single CE-PDA method. The method was used as the basis to develop a CE-ESI-MS methodology through the optimisation of the relevant ESI and MS parameters.

These parameters were optimised in positive and negative ion modes for cationic <b>dyes</b> and <b>anionic</b> <b>dyes,</b> respectively. The two analyses could be carried out successively on a single sample. In view of the application to cultural heritage objects, the CE-ESI-MS analytical procedure was applied to identify the dyes in a Filmcolor artefact, late version of the autochrome.

40|$|Among {{the various}} {{techniques}} for colour removal, {{adsorption is the}} most efficient and practically viable. However due to the relatively high production cost and difficulty in regeneration of activated carbon conventionally used as adsorbent for dye removal, {{there is a need}} to find alternatives. Consequently, layered double hydroxide (LDH) was proposed as an alternative adsorbent. MgAlâNOââlayered double hydroxide (LDH) (molar ratio Mg/Al: 4 : 1) was synthesised using coprecipitation method followed by hydrothermal treatment at 70 Â°C. Its calcined form (CLDH) was obtained at calcination temperature of 500 Â°C. The physicochemical characteristics of adsorbents, LDH and CLDH were determined prior to adsorption study involving <b>anionic</b> <b>dyes</b> (Acid Blue 29, Reactive Black 5, Reactive Orange 16 and Reactive Red 120 and a cationic dye Methylene Blue.

Adsorption of <b>anionic</b> <b>dyes</b> were influenced by pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time, initial dye concentration and temperature. High percentage removal for <b>anionic</b> <b>dyes</b> was favoured at pH < pHpzc (9. 3 - 10) indicating strong electrostatic interaction between negatively charged dyes and positively-charged surface of adsorbent. Complete decolorization of <b>anionic</b> <b>dyes</b> was achievable for 25 mg/L concentration within 3 hrs at 0. 2 g/L LDH dosage, but higher dye concentration needed longer equilibrium time within 24 hours.

5000|$|... Singaram was {{developing}} a glucose sensor based on boronic acids which {{might lead to}} an implantable diagnostic tool for continuous glucose detection for persons afflicted with diabetes mellitus. [...] Carbohydrates and their derivatives, including saccharides, phosphosugars, and nucleotides, are ubiquitous metabolites in every organism. Sensitive probes for monitoring {{the presence of these}} metabolites provide researchers a powerful tool to elucidate biological processes. Diabetics monitor glucose by testing blood four or more times a day, obtained from finger pricks or other sampling method. Glucose levels can fluctuate widely throughout the day, making it difficult to determine when it is important to test the blood. There has been no way to continuously monitor those fluctuations over long periods. Our group has extensively developed fluorescent probes for metabolites including glucose, phosphosugars, and nucleotides. We have developed a two-component optical probe with a modular receptor scaffold. This small molecule probe is water-soluble, and operates in the blue-green region of the spectrum. Saccharide recognition in our probe system is achieved with a boronic acids appended viologen that serves as an analyte responsive fluorescence quencher. We used an <b>anionic</b> <b>dye</b> which forms a weakly fluorescent complex with the cationic viologen receptor. At and near physiological pH, saccharide binding by the receptor results in a partial charge neutralization of the viologen. This produces an increase in the fluorescent signal dependent on glucose concentration. Incorporating the probe into a hydrogel polymer allowed for continuous monitoring of glucose concentrations in the physiological range in vivo. In another application, an array of probes with differential selectivity was used to discriminate important carbohydrate metabolites in water in multiwell plates.|$|E

Materials and Methods:MWCNTs were oxidized and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). In batch tests, the effects of various parameters such as pH solution (2. 0 - 7. 0), oxidized MWCNT dose (0. 01 - 0. 04 g), contact time (7 - 60 minutes), initial dye concentration (30 - 350 mg/l), and temperature (25 - 55 Â° C) were investigated. Results:The optimum pH for removing of investigated <b>anionic</b> <b>dyes</b> from water solutions {{was found to be}} 2. 0. The adsorption of the dyes reached equilibrium at 15 minutes.
