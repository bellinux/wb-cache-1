40|$|A {{custom built}} near-infra-red (NIR) Mueller matrix imaging {{ellipsometer}} (MMI) based on ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLCs) and waveplates (WPs) {{is described in}} detail. The instrument is used to perform strain-induced birefringence imaging of crystalline silicon, and visualise the 3 -D orientation of collagen fibres expressing linear retardance. The development of a spectroscopic Mueller matrix imaging microscope ellipsometer (&# 181;MMI) is presented. Preliminary verification indicate that the constructed &# 181;MMI works as expected. The theory behind Mueller matrix ellipsometry is outlined, including the description of polarised light, and its representation by the Mueller-Stokes formalism. Detailed analysis of the Mueller matrix, encompassing both the forward polar and the differential decomposition, is presented. These techniques {{are used in the}} study of both organic and in-organic samples. Photoelastic theory is briefly discussed in order to explain the phenomena of birefringence in strained silicon crystals, and a simple model was developed in order to estimate the maximum shear-stress. Vertical cross-sections of bi-crystal silicon separated by near-coincident site lattice grain boundaries Σ 9 and Σ 27 <b>a</b> <b>ingots</b> were studied using the custom built near infra-red MMI at 1300 nm. The obtained images were decomposed using the forward polar decomposition. The resulting optical properties were used to map the internal shear-stress of the samples. The shear-stress was found to be in the range of 2. 5 MPa to 5 MPa. Further studies are proposed in order to verify this technique. Chicken tendon is imaged at 940 nm with different incidence angles (0 deg and +/- 30 deg) using the custom built MMI. The differential decomposed Mueller matrix measurements were used to calculate the 3 -D directional orientation of the collagen fibres. Validation of the obtained 3 -D directional orientation was done by comparing the results with second-harmonic generation (SHG) images. The two methods were found to be in good agreement. Development of an optimal broadband spectroscopic Mueller matrix imaging system to work in the range 550 nm to 1150 nm is described. A design similar to the earlier presented MMI based on FLCs and WPs was chosen. The concept of genetic algorithms is introduced and utilised in order to improve on the design. Realisation of the instrument is documented from the choice of components, characterisation, re-optimisation of the design, and lastly, building and verifying the instrument. </p...|$|E

Electromagnetic alignment and electromagnetic focusing use evaporation {{material that is}} in the form of <b>an</b> <b>ingot,</b> while the pendant drop configuration uses <b>a</b> rod. <b>Ingots</b> are enclosed in a copper crucible or hearth, while a rod will be mounted at one end in a socket. Both the crucible and socket must be cooled. This is typically done by water circulation. In the case of ingots, molten liquid can form on its surface, which can be kept constant by vertical displacement of the ingot. The evaporation rate may be on the order of 10−2 g/(cm2·s).|$|R

40|$|The use of TurboSwirl {{to obtain}} an {{improved}} steel cleanliness during filling of <b>an</b> <b>ingot</b> was numerically studied by VOF and DPM models. It was found that a radius-reduced TurboSwirl or a proper tapered mold entrance nozzle with an adequate developed region for steel flow can {{reduce the risk of}} mold flux entrapment in <b>a</b> mold. The <b>ingot</b> casting process can create highly turbulent conditions inside the mold during the initial stages of casting. Since the TurboSwirl generates much calmer filling conditions it can promote separation of large nonmetallic inclusions. The TurboSwirl also collects large inclusions (200 [*]μm) towards the axis of rotation, which should promote agglomeration. In addition, the residence time for inclusions of small sizes can be prolonged, increasing chance of agglomeration, which indirectly promotes their separation from steel. Moreover, the average turbulent dissipation rate in <b>an</b> <b>ingot</b> casting swirl setup is about 40 % higher than that in a no swirl setup. This further facilitates the agglomeration of inclusions before they enter the mold. The removal of nonmetallic inclusions is thus enhanced because of an increasing inclusion collision rate due to both Stokes collisions and turbulent collisions, while maintaining a calm flow inside the mold...|$|R
