5|$|Mulder {{believes}} that the entity travels from victim to victim like a contagion. At his request, Scully performs an autopsy on Chantara's body at the morgue. During the procedure, a conversation between Scully and the coroner's assistant (Tara Karsian) causes the latter to panic about a Hantavirus outbreak. The entity suddenly kills her with the disease. When Mulder discusses the death with Scully, he realizes that Wetzel {{is in danger of}} being revisited by the entity. The agents and police return to the crack house, where the entity has trapped an injured Wetzel in an upstairs room. The agents are unable to enter the room until dawn comes, when the entity disappears and spares Wetzel's life. After the incident is over, Scully expresses her sympathies to Mulder that being filmed by a national television crew did not provide the public exposure to paranormal phenomena that he had hoped. However, Mulder remains hopeful, noting that it <b>all</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> how the production crew edits the footage together.|$|E
2500|$|Before age 13, she {{had broken}} into the top 100 {{players in the world}} and the British Chess Magazine declared: [...] "Judit Polgár's recent results make the {{performances}} of Fischer and Kasparov at a similar age pale by comparison." [...] British GM Nigel Short called Judit [...] "one of the three or four greatest chess prodigies in history". The other great chess prodigies were Paul Morphy, José Capablanca, and Samuel Reshevsky. However, Kasparov expressed early doubts: [...] "She has fantastic chess talent, but she is, after all, a woman. It <b>all</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the imperfections of the feminine psyche. No woman can sustain a prolonged battle." [...] Later in life, however, after he had lost a rapid game against Polgar himself in 2002, Kasparov revised his opinion: [...] "The Polgars showed that there are no inherent limitations to their aptitude—an idea that many male players refused to accept until they had unceremoniously been crushed by a twelve-year-old with a ponytail." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{key play}} {{occurred}} in the following Game 5 which changed {{the outcome of the}} series. With 2.1 seconds left in the fourth quarter, the Knicks' Hubert Davis attempted a 23-foot shot which was defended by Pippen, who was called for a personal foul by referee Hue Hollins, who determined that Pippen made contact with Davis. Television replays indicated that contact was made after Davis had released the ball. Davis successfully made both free throw attempts to assist in the Knicks victory, 87–86, and gave the Knicks a three games to two advantage in the series. the resulting incident was described as the most controversial moment of Hollins' career by Referee magazine. Hollins defended the call after the game saying, [...] "I saw Scottie make contact with his shooting motion. I'm positive there was contact on the shot." [...] Darell Garretson, the league's supervisor of officials and who also officiated in the league, agreed with Hollins and issued a statement, [...] "The perception is that referees should put their whistles in their pockets in the last minutes. But it <b>all</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> what is sufficient contact. There's an old, old adage that refs don't make those calls in the last seconds. Obviously, you hope you don't make a call that will decide a game. But the call was within the context of how we had been calling them all game." [...] Garretson later changed his stance of the call the next season. Speaking to a Chicago Tribune reporter, Garretson described Hollins' call as [...] "terrible". Chicago head coach Phil Jackson, upset over the outcome of the game, was fined $10,000 for comparing the loss to the gold medal game controversy at the 1972 Summer Olympics.|$|E
