40|$|Aims Our {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} characteristics of sulfur (S) accumulation and allocation by Suaeda salsa in two different habitats of the intertidal zone in the Yellow River Estuary of China. Methods We established two plots (30 m × 30 m) in two different tidal flats and collected different organs of S. salsa every 20 days from May to November 2008 from four or five sites selected at random from the two plots. Important findings The biomass of different organs of S. salsa in middle tidal flat (JP 1) and low tidal flat (JP 2) showed significant seasonal dynamics, and the values of JP 1 tended to be higher than those of JP 2. For JP 1 and JP 2, the ratios of aboveground biomass to belowground biomass changed similarly, but the values of JP 2 tendedto be larger than those of JP 1. The litter biomass of JP 1 and JP 2 increased exponentially during the growing season. Although the total sulfur (TS) contents in leaves, stems or litter of JP 1 and JP 2 fluctuated greatly during the growing season, they all initially increased and then decreased. In comparison, values in roots decreased at all times following an exponential decay model. The TS <b>accumulation</b> <b>amount</b> and rate (VS) of different organs and litter also had seasonal changes, and the values of above-ground organs of JP 1 were much higher than those of JP 2. Moreover, the TS <b>accumulation</b> <b>amount</b> and VS of above-ground parts were higher than those of below-ground parts. The S allocation ratios of different parts of JP 1 and JP 2 also had significant differences. Leaves had the highest allocation ratio, and values of JP 1 and JP 2 were (38. 34 ± 16. 19) % and (66. 27 ± 12. 09) %, respectively, indicating that leaves were the most important site of S storage...|$|E

The BEL- 7402 / 5 -FU cells tended to grow in clusters in vitro. It was found that the population doubling time of BEL- 7402 / 5 -FU cells was longer than that of its parental cells. The plate cloning efficiency and the adherence rate of BEL- 7402 / 5 -FU cells at the 2 nd and 3 rd hour were both lower than those of the parental cells. The distributing proportion of BEL- 7402 / 5 -FU cells in G 0 /G 1 phase was less than that of the parental cells, whereas the distributing proportion of BEL- 7402 / 5 -FU cells in S phase was higher than that of the parental cells.

In vascularly constrained plants (i. e. sectored plants), effects of vascular connections likely limit homogenous resource delivery, especially when environmental resource distribution is patchy. Here, we quantify relative roles of vascular connections, demands by different leaves (i. e. by leaf age and size), and molecule size of transported N compounds (effective sectoriality: nitrate v. ammonium) on allocation of 15 N in the sectored tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Vascular connections were the strongest predictor of both <b>accumulation</b> (<b>amount</b> per leaf; P< 0. 0001) and δ (estimate of concentration; P< 0. 0001) 15 N values in mature leaves, but young expanding leaves did not show such dramatically sectored uptake (accumulation: P= 0. 0685; δ: P= 0. 0455), suggesting that sectoriality is less strong in young expanding tissue, especially in the youngest leaf.

Incursions of the South Asian monsoon (SAM) occur sometimes during the summer months accompanied by strong precipitation but play a minor role for the total <b>accumulation</b> <b>amount.</b> Dust layers found in the snow pits show a rare earth elements signature which indicates that the dust very likely originates from the arid regions of western China and Central Asia.

Based on 500 km of radar profiles, forming a 10 km grid with 1 km spacing and a star-like pattern consisting of nine legs up to 25 km long, nine internal reflection horizons are continuously tracked. Depth distributions of electromagnetic wave speed, mass, and age are derived from dielectric-profilingdata of the EDML core. The horizons cover the upper 110 m of ice and yield the regional age-depth distribution, corresponding to around 1040 a of deposition history. The spatial pattern of accumulation shows a strong decreasing trend from north tosouth during all time intervals, roughly perpendicular to the ice divide. The accumulation, averaged over the last 140 a, decreases from 71 to 54 kg m- 2 a&# 8722; 1 over a distance of 40 km, about 25 % of the accumulation at EDML.

Therefore, three chill models were used to investigate whether winter temperature data {{can be related to}} E. nitens flower bud production at sites differing in chill <b>accumulation.</b> <b>Amount</b> of accumulated winter chill, in conjunction with paclobutrazol treatment, was able to explain between 66 and 72 % of the variation in E. nitens flower bud production. Although the potential chilling requirement of E. nitens can be calculated with similar accuracy by each of the chill models tested, the Dynamic Model performed best under the particular range of experimental conditions. At low to moderate levels of winter chill (43 to 81 Chilling Portions (CPs) of the Dynamic Model), paclobutrazol application hastened first flowering and increased the percentage reproductive trees by between 5 – 27 % in the case of seedlings, and between 2 – 62 % in the case of grafts. At high levels of winter chill (> 87 CPs), paclobutrazol had a negligible effect on the percentage reproductive trees in the case of either seedlings or grafts. At four and five years after planting, very high levels of accumulated winter chill (96 CPs) stimulated a high percentage of seedlings (25 – 50 %) and grafts (55 – 64 %) to produce flower buds. Considerable variation in precocity and chilling requirement (for floral induction) is evident within the South African E. nitens breeding population. A better accuracy in relating E. nitens floral bud production to amount of prior winter chilling could be achieved by further experimentation involving fewer genotypes and a wider range of chilling conditions...|$|E
40|$|Electrical treeing is an {{electrical}} aging phenomenon that severely threatens the operation safety of power equipment, in which polymer {{is used as}} primary insulation material. A type of low-density polyethylene-montmorillonite (LDPE/MMT) nanocomposite was prepared using melt method to study the impact of MMT nanoparticles on {{the growth of the}} electrical tree and on the breakdown properties of the LDPE material. The distribution characteristic of space charges of the specimens under DC voltage of – 50 kV/mm and short-circuit conditions was measured using pulsed electro-acoustic method. The electrical tree aging characteristics of specimens under AC voltage of power frequency were studied using needle-plate electrode structure test platform. The starting voltage of initiation, the triggering rate, and the growth rate of the electrical trees, as well as the breakdown performance of the specimens under AC voltage of power frequency were measured. The inhibitory mechanism of MMT nano-particles on the growth of electrical trees in nano-composites, and the mechanism behind the improvement of the breakdown strength of the LDPE/MMT specimens were illustrated. Experimental results showed that, the addition of MMT can effectively reduce the amount of space charges injected from electrodes and the <b>accumulation</b> <b>amount</b> in the center of samples. Moreover, space charges dissipated more slowly during short-circuit conditions. The speed and the scale of the growth of the electrical tree declined as the initiation conditions of electrical trees growing in LDPE/MMT nanocomposites increased; meanwhile, the breakdown strength increased substantially. Here are the reasons: MMT can reduce the mobility of carriers in LDPE material, thereby contributing to the improvement of the distribution of space charges. In the meanwhile, MMT changed the development path of electrical trees, and extended the discharge distance. Consequently, MMT postponed the occurrence of pene-trable breakdown in the LDPE/MMT specimen, and ultimately improved the breakdown strength of the specimen...|$|E

Several important trade routes from India and China (including the Silk Road) passed through Bactria and, {{as early as the}} Bronze Age, this had allowed the <b>accumulation</b> of vast <b>amounts</b> of wealth by the mostly nomadic population.
