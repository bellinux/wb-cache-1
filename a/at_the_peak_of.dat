40|$|Abstract-We {{show that}} in a {{thermonuclear}} plasma the magnetosonic wave propagating normal to the magnetic field can be unstable. The growth rate is small, however, and the wave is easily stabilized by perpendicular thermal conduction. IN A FULLY IGNITED thermonuclear plasma the fusion energy production balances the various energy losses and the fusion reaction is self-sustaining. The product ions (alpha particles {{in the case of}} a deuterium-tritium plasma) carry a considerable amount of free energy and can therefore drive new plasma instabilities. JACKSON (1986) considered as a preliminary example the propagation of a sound wave through a self-sustaining unmagnetized fusion plasma and showed that such a wave would be thermally unstable. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pressure wave the fusion energy production is enhanced due to the increased density and temperature (the converse being true <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pressure troughs), and this leads to amplification of the wave. A corresponding dispersion relation was derived from a simple fluid model. However, although increased alpha production occurs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wave, the very high energy of the alphas means they have very low collisionality.
