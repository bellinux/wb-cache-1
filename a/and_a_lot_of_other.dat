500|$|Prior to the album's release, Manson made {{a series}} of disparaging {{comments}} regarding Interscope and its artistic censorship; as well as its then-CEO Jimmy Iovine, who Manson said [...] "wasn't smart enough to understand what [...] do." [...] He also accused the label of caring more about Vitamin Water [...] than music. Several days after the album's release, Trent Reznor – who, as of 2015, remains friends and business partners with Iovine – called Manson a [...] "dopey clown", and said that [...] "He is a malicious guy and will step on anybodies face to succeed and cross any line of decency." [...] Manson responded by accusing Reznor of professional jealousy, saying: [...] "Since I've known Trent, he's always let his jealousy and bitterness for other people get in the way. I'm not talking about me—I sat back and watched him be jealous of Kurt Cobain and Billy Corgan <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> musicians in the past. I just don't find time to do that. I stopped thinking about him a while back." ...|$|E
500|$|Because [...] "radical, body-altering" [...] {{surgery on}} a long-running {{character}} {{would cause the}} production team ongoing problems with continuity, {{it was decided that}} Peggy would have a [...] "less visible" [...] lumpectomy, rather than a mastectomy. A member of the EastEnders production team explained: [...] "We have to think about costume and what it's going to look like afterwards and what we're lumbering ourselves with [...] you have to think of that for a long-term character." [...] Additionally, giving Peggy a lumpectomy at that stage of her disease was viewed favourably by source organisations, as it helped to spread a message that a mastectomy is not necessary in all breast cancer cases. However, the storyline was revisited several times over the next few years. In August 1997, Peggy was given the [...] "all-clear" [...] at her follow-up mammogram, and in March 1999 the cancer returned and she underwent a mastectomy, while in 2000 she had a breast reconstruction. It has been reported that Peggy was the first soap opera character to undergo a mastectomy. BBC Production chief executive Matthew Bannister praised Windsor's portrayal of Peggy coming to terms with a mastectomy, commenting: [...] "It's brought a good deal of comfort and help to us <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> people." ...|$|E

He sometimes jogged in the park and, while he owned him, took his Doberman Pinscher for walks. Lunch at the Clermont Club was followed by afternoon games of backgammon. Returning home to change into evening dress, the earl typically spent {{the remainder of the}} day at the Clermont, gambling into the early hours, watched sometimes by Veronica. In 1956, while still working at Brandt's, he had written of his desire to have [...] "£2m in the bank", claiming that [...] "motor-cars, yachts, expensive holidays and security for the future would give myself <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> people a lot of pleasure". He was described by his friends as a shy and taciturn man, but with his tall stature, [...] "luxuriant guardsman's moustache" [...] and masculine pursuits, his exploits made him popular. His profligacy extended to hiring private aircraft to take his friends to the races, asking a car dealer he knew to source an Aston Martin drophead coupé, drinking expensive Russian vodka and racing powerboats. In September 1966 he unsuccessfully screen tested for a part in Woman Times Seven, prompting him to automatically decline a later offer from film producer Cubby Broccoli, to screen test him for the role of James Bond.|$|E

But Dickie Bird <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> people have said, 'Geoff, there's nothing wrong; if you were guilty, then {{an awful lot of}} others were.' I think that's a fair comment; {{it was just one of}} those periods." [...] Cricket writer, Colin Bateman, noted that [...] "Geoff Cope's career was blighted by suspicions that his off-spinner's action was illegal and twice – in 1972 and 1978 – he was suspended by Lord's. The second suspension came after he had broken through into the Test side the previous winter in Pakistan, where he came tantalisingly close to a debut hat-trick".|$|E
2500|$|The demos {{finalised}} in Malibu {{caught the}} attention of Thom Panunzio, who aside from his production work (Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen, Ozzy Osbourne), served as an executive for Geffen Records. The band were flattered by Panunzio's interest, immediately agreeing to the collaboration. The quintet had decided against working with Neal Avron, who had produced the band's three previous albums, as they wanted to try something different. The band's frontman, Jordan Pundik explained that, [...] "We love Neal. Neal's amazing and he's one of our really close friends. But after three records with him, after writing those records <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> bands started to come out and get kind of popular, we kind of wanted to try something different." [...] After hearing a demo of [...] "On My Mind", Panunzio was keen to work on the project. Pundik recalled that, [...] "one of the songs that really got him to say. 'OK, I want to do this' was that song 'On My Mind.' That song really got him. Thom's done everything from like the Go-Go's to Bob Dylan, so he's very well rounded in music." ...|$|E

We've sorted it down to what songs are on the record, what the sequence of the songs is. The album art is ready." [...] However, shortly afterwards, Rose told MTV News [...] "You'll see , but I don't know if 'soon' is the word". Dizzy Reed mentioned in November 2002 that the album [...] "should be in stores by June (2003)" [...] and stating there were only [...] "a few odds and ends left to do, a couple of finishing touches, a couple of vocals – {{and we need to}} mix it." [...] Rose also confirmed the plans for multiple albums and stated that a part of the delay was due to lack of support from the label to older bands, saying, [...] "I've had to do way more jobs in it than I'm supposed to. I've had to be manager, A man, producer, sole lyric writer, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> things." [...] An editor from antiMUSIC claimed Rose told him in an informal chat in June 2003 that [...] "he wants to make sure it is a perfect as possible before it is released". In mid-2003, the band reportedly started the process of re-recording the album again. Shortly after Buckethead left the band in March 2004, Rose {{released a}} statement saying, [...] "Guns will be moving forward, we hope to announce a release date within the next few months." [...] Stinson claimed the album would be in the mastering stages by November 2004.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Australian journalist Nick Milligan on 25 March 2011, Anderson explained, [...] "I was in Los Angeles in 1989 recording an album which the 'Bound For Glory' single came off and I was hanging around with the Gunners <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> LA bad boy rock bands that we supposedly influenced. I realised then that apart {{from the fact that}} I was there to establish myself as a singer songwriter, there was still this great following for the band. I rang up the other members and said 'Let's reform. We've been apart for three years or more.' It was long enough for us to settle our differences and let all the wounds heal. I rang up each of the original members that were still interested and they all said, 'Yeah, let's get together.' So I said we should negotiate a deal where the band can come over and record in Los Angeles. But, of course, that was the year that our original drummer [...] "Digger" [...] Royall kicked his heroin habit. While he was recovering on methadone, cancer exploded through his body, quite sadly. That was the irony of it, because the cancer had been suppressed by the heroin addiction. Within months he was dead. That shook the band so badly on a personal level, because we had been so enthusiastic to reform. We didn't reform until '92. In '93, the word got around, because we had reformed with our existing drummer Paul DeMarco. The Gunners heard we were out playing again and said, 'We want you to do our support gigs throughout Australia.' We did those two Guns N' Roses raceways gigs - Eastern Creek in Sydney and the raceway down in Melbourne." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} {{designing}} Beauty and the Beasts costumes was more collaborative between designer and actor {{than most other}} Broadway productions Hould-Ward had previously worked on, and she frequently sought input from the cast {{to make sure they}} were able to move. Designing Belle's costumes was an [...] "easy" [...] task for Hould-Ward; the character is initially dressed in standard Disney heroine attire until replaced by more elaborate costumes once Belle meets the Beast. Hould-Ward based the character's famous yellow ballgown on several historic portraits. The gown became the first costume built for the production in order to accommodate Disney's mandate to market the dress in photoshoots and commercials starring Egan and Mann, six months prior to rehearsals. Weighing 45 pounds, the dress is a combination of various patterns and materials, including a hoop skirt, silk, brocade, beading, flowers and bows. Too large to fit inside Egan's dressing room after the ballroom sequence, undressing required assistance from three backstage crew members who used wires to hoist the dress up into the rafters, where it would be stored until the next performance. A lot of time was spent designing the Beast's costume, the creation of which was especially challenging due to requirements to [...] "allow enough of the performer to show through." [...] Hould-Ward's initial designs for the Beast were constantly rejected by Katzenberg, who reiterated that she [...] "put the movie onstage" [...] until the producer realized that the excessive prosthetics were limiting Mann's vocal performance. A wire frame was also used to maintain the costume's shape, which evokes heavy metal fashion until ultimately substituted for a black Oscar de la Renta-inspired velvet suit when the Beast finally transforms back into a prince. Hould-Ward designed the leads' costumes from the perspective of her daughter Leah, explaining, [...] "when Leah comes to see it, she remembers from the movie that the Beast was in that blue jacket. Leah expects that blue jacket, and if you don't give it to her, she <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> ten-year-olds are going to be sad". At the same time, the designer wanted her creations to be equally as interesting on an intellectual level for parents to enjoy also.|$|E
