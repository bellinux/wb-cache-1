40|$|Proteins {{are prone}} to {{inactivation}} in aqueous solutions because chemical modification and aggregation usually occur, particularly at high temperature. This review focuses on the recent advance in practical application with <b>amine</b> <b>compounds</b> that prevent the heat-induced inactivation and aggregation of proteins. Coexistence of amine solutes, typically diamines, polyamines, amino acid esters, and amidated amino acids decreases the heat-induced inactivation rate of proteins by one order of magnitude compared with that {{in the absence of}} additives under low concentrations of proteins at physiological pH. The <b>amine</b> <b>compounds</b> mainly suppress chemical modification, typically the β-elimination of disulfide bond and deamidation of asparagine side chain, thereby preventing heat-induced inactivation of proteins. Polyamines do not improve the refolding yield of proteins, owing to decrease in the solubility of unfolded proteins.

40|$|The strong {{influence}} of graphite oxide (GO) nanofiller {{on the glass}} transition temperature (Tg) of epoxy resins, generally attributed to restricted molecular mobility of the epoxy matrix by the nanofiller or to the crosslinking of GO layers via the epoxy chains, is investigated.

However, similar Tg increases are observed, when the filler is a high-surface-area graphite (HSAG), lacking oxidized groups. Moreover, these Tg differences tend to disappear as a consequence of aging or thermal annealing. These results suggest that the observed Tg increases are mainly due to a catalytic activity of graphitic layers on the crosslinking reaction between the epoxy resin components (epoxide oligomer and diamine), rather than to reaction of the epoxide groups with functional groups of GO.
