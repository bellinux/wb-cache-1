5|$|Responses are {{polyclonal}} {{in nature}} as each clone somewhat specializes in producing antibodies against a given epitope, and because, each antigen contains multiple epitopes, {{each of which}} in turn can be recognized {{by more than one}} clone of B cells. To be able to react to innumerable antigens, as well as multiple constituent epitopes, the immune system requires the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> a very great number of epitopes in all, i.e., there should be a great diversity of B cell clones.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{occasionally}} {{a host of}} parasitic cuckoos, such as the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus), but this is minimal because the common blackbird recognizes the adult of the parasitic species and its non-mimetic eggs. In the UK, only three nests of 59,770 examined (0.005%) contained cuckoo eggs. The introduced merula blackbird in New Zealand, where the cuckoo does not occur, has, over the past 130 years, lost the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> the adult common cuckoo but still rejects non-mimetic eggs.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} scientific literature on chess psychology. Alfred Binet and others showed that knowledge and verbal, rather than visuospatial, ability {{lies at the}} core of expertise. In his doctoral thesis, Adriaan de Groot showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of a position. According to de Groot, this perception, made possible by years of practice and study, {{is more important than the}} sheer ability to anticipate moves. De Groot showed that chess masters can memorize positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly. The ability to memorize does not alone account for chess-playing skill, since masters and novices, when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces, had equivalent recall (about half a dozen positions in each case). Rather, it is the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> patterns, which are then memorized, which distinguished the skilled players from the novices. When the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game, the masters had almost total positional recall.|$|E

50|$|Festinger's {{influential}} social comparison {{theory can}} be viewed as an extension of his prior theory related to the reliance on social reality for evaluating attitudes and opinions to the realm of abilities. Starting with the premise that humans have an innate drive to accurately evaluate their opinions and abilities, Festinger postulated that people will seek to evaluate their opinions and abilities by comparing them with those of others. Specifically, people will seek out others who are close to one’s own opinions and abilities for comparison because accurate comparisons are difficult when others are too divergent from oneself. To use Festinger's example, a chess novice does not compare his chess <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognized</b> masters of chess, nor does a college student compare his intellectual <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> a toddler.|$|R

However, slower vocabulary learners showed a deficit in their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> accurately <b>recognize</b> words learned visually and later heard. Results indicate that decoding takes place more readily than encoding (used to mean the opposite of decoding) and that slow learners have difficulty forming well-specified phonological representations when given words orthographically...|$|R
