The pseudo-first-order abatement kinetic was relatively fitted. The decrease in the distance between electrodes from 10.0 to 2.5  cm increased the rate constant from 0.01 to 0.026  min− 1 for TD, 0.007 to 0.020  min− 1 for COD and 0.006 to 0.018  min− 1 for BOD using Al–Fe electrode combination and from 0.008 to 0.019  min− 1 for TD, 0.006 to 0.015  min− 1 for COD and 0.005 to 0.014  min− 1 for BOD using Fe–Al electrode combination.

Chronoamperometry showed that significant oxidation of reference standard methyl parathion commenced at 1. 8 V vs Ag/AgCl, while spectrophotometric studies revealed that the absorbance of a commercial formulation of the insecticide decayed according to time in electrolysis. Electrochemical degradation experiments were performed in a laboratory-constructed polypropylene cell in which solutions containing methyl parathion (equivalent to 60 mgL− 1) were subjected to <b>electrolytic</b> <b>treatment</b> at different current densities (5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 mAcm− 2).

40|$|Tartrate {{stabilization}} is {{the process}} that removes components {{that contribute to the}} crystallization of potassium hydrogen tartrate (KHT) and calcium tartrate (CaT) which is an undesirable outcome for wine quality. There are a variety of current tartrate stabilization techniques such as cold stabilization, chemical additives, ion exchange resins, and electrodialysis that stabilize wine, but the most popular being cold stabilization. Cold stabilization requires high amounts of energy and resources to stabilize wine. With the ever increasing demand for more efficient processing, an alternative tartrate stabilization technology based on an electrolytic method was developed and its viability to stabilize wine was determined. Twelve treatments involving different combinations of time and current were replicated three times each on different batches of Chardonnay wine. Several different variables were analyzed for stability and quality purposes. Tartaric acid, potassium, calcium, and conductivity differences were the most important factors for tartrate stability. Temperature, titratable acidity, pH, color (hue and intensity), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were indicators of sensory quality characteristics of the wine. The concentrations of potassium, calcium, and tartaric acid were reduced by the electrolytic method at satisfactory process parameters, inherently making the wine more stable. The temperature and hue were significantly affected by the electrolytic method and accelerated the oxidative browning process. <b>Electrolytic</b> <b>treatment</b> of Chardonnay is a viable alternative stabilization technology. The technology can be further developed to become a great option in terms of water and energy consumption, process time, and price...|$|R
