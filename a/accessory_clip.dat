50|$|The Realist 45 also {{features}} the then-standard, old-style hot shoe (referred to as an <b>accessory</b> <b>clip).</b> This was more versatile {{at the time}} it was released because it allowed it to use most contemporary flash accessories, and in recent years it has made it much easier to find an adapter for modern electronic flash units than it was for the Kodak.|$|E
50|$|A {{supplementary}} lens is an <b>accessory</b> lens <b>clipped,</b> screwed or bayoneted {{to the front}} of a main lens that alters the lens' effective focal length. If it is a positive (converging) only supplement, it will shorten the focal length and reset the infinity focus of the lens to the focal length of the {{supplementary lens}}. These so-called close-up lenses are often uncorrected single element menisci, but are a cheap way to provide close focusing for an otherwise limited focus range lens.|$|R
25|$|ABC {{promoted}} {{and sold}} the program as prime family entertainment. Sponsors included the American Chicle Co., Rolaids, Anacin (1956), Williamson-Dickie (195760), Massey Ferguson (195860), Arrid, Postum (1958), Carter's Little Pills and Sargent's Dog Care Products (1960); and was sold nationally by Ted Bates & Company. Joe Slattery handled station breaks and some commercials, often appearing during Jubilee USA with Massey Ferguson farm tractors and <b>accessories</b> in film <b>clips</b> or on stage.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{documented}} {{appearance of}} the expression “To give the shirt off one’s back,” happened in 1771 as an idiom that indicates extreme desperation or generosity and is still in common usage. In 1827 Hannah Montague, a housewife in upstate New York, invents the detachable collar. Tired of constantly washing her husband’s entire shirt when only the collar needed it, she cut off his collars and devised a way of attaching them to the neckband after washing. It wasn't until the 1930s that collar stays became popular, although these early <b>accessories</b> resembled tie <b>clips</b> more than the small collar stiffeners available today. They connected the collar points to the necktie, keeping them in place ...|$|R
40|$|Accessory middle {{cerebral}} artery (MCA) is an infrequent vascular anomaly of the brain. Cerebral aneurysms {{associated with this}} anomalous artery are also very rare. To our knowledge, there have only been ten previous reports of an aneurysm associated with accessory MCA. The authors present two patients with accessory MCA-related aneurysms. A 38 -year-old male and a 59 -year-old female both presented with sudden-onset severe headache. In both patients, computed tomography (CT) scan revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage. A subsequent angiogram demonstrated an accessory MCA arising from the anterior {{cerebral artery}} (ACA) and a saccular aneurysm at the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) complex associated with an <b>accessory</b> MCA. Surgical <b>clipping</b> allowed for complete exclusion of the aneurysm from the arterial circulation. Based on our review of the ten cases of aneurysms associated with accessory MCA documented in the literature, we suggest that accessory MCA-related aneurysms can be classified according to whether the accessory MCA originates from the proximal A 1 segment or from the ACoA complex. We also {{emphasize the importance of}} precise interpretation of preoperative angiograms and intraoperative precaution in determining the presence of this anomalous artery prior to temporary clip placement...|$|R
