25|$|Surface albedo {{is defined}} as the ratio of {{irradiance}} reflected to the irradiance received by a surface. The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and <b>angular</b> <b>distribution</b> of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface. These factors vary with atmospheric composition, geographic location and time (see Position of the Sun). While bi-hemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly or annual averages.|$|E

This report extends similar {{recent studies of}} O 2 and N 2 to a wider set of molecules. We found that for sub- 10 -fs pulses of sufficiently low intensity the fragments' <b>angular</b> <b>distributions</b> for all studied molecules are determined by angular dependence of the first ionization step. Those experimental <b>angular</b> <b>distributions</b> were in good agreement with angular dependent ionization probabilities calculated with the molecular tunneling ionization theory. The measured <b>angular</b> <b>distributions</b> directly reflect the symmetry of the corresponding molecular orbitals. For higher laser intensities and longer pulse durations, dynamic alignment and postionization alignment start to affect the <b>angular</b> <b>distributions</b> and ion fragments are preferentially ejected along the laser-polarization direction.

40|$|<b>Angular</b> <b>distributions</b> {{of silicon}} atoms {{sputtered}} by gallium ions at grazing incidence were investigated experimentally and by simulation. The energies and the ion beam fluence studied are typical for using {{focused ion beam}} techniques for silicon micro-structuring. The <b>angular</b> <b>distributions</b> of the sputtered atoms at grazing ion beam incidence loose their cylindrical symmetry around the target surface normal due to the anisotropy of single collisions and of the collision cascades initiated by the energetic ions. The <b>angular</b> <b>distributions</b> were studied in this work both experimentally and using the simulation methods of Monte-Carlo and of Molecular Dynamics. To study {{the influence of the}} surface structure on the <b>angular</b> <b>distributions</b> of the sputtered atoms, different arrangements of silicon at oms {{on the surface of the}} targets were tested in simulations using Molecular Dynamics.

40|$|The {{sputtering}} of Cu atoms from liquid targets by normally incident 5 keV Ar^+ ions was simulated {{using the}} multiple interaction molecular dynamics technique. Yields, energy <b>distributions,</b> and <b>angular</b> <b>distributions</b> of sputtered atoms were obtained at several temperatures slightly {{above and below}} the experimental melting point of copper.

The ratio of yields from individual layers of the liquid targets, and the energy and <b>angular</b> <b>distributions</b> of ejected atoms generally were found to be similar to those obtained in previous simulations with solid Cu targets. Our results also are in qualitative agreement with Dumke's measurements of <b>angular</b> <b>distributions</b> and layer yield ratios of sputtered atoms from liquid Ga-In eutectic alloy targets.
