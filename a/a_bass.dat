5|$|Some {{instruments}} {{fall into}} more than one category: for example, the cello may be considered tenor, baritone or bass, depending on how its music fits into the ensemble, and the trombone may be alto, tenor, baritone, or bass and the French horn, bass, baritone, tenor, or alto, depending on the range it is played in. Many instruments have their range {{as part of their}} name: soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone, baritone horn, alto flute, bass guitar, etc. Additional adjectives describe instruments above the soprano range or below the bass, for example: sopranino saxophone, contrabass clarinet. When used in the name of an instrument, these terms are relative, describing the instrument's range in comparison to other instruments of its family and not in comparison to the human voice range or instruments of other families. For example, <b>a</b> <b>bass</b> flute's range is from C3 to F♯6, while <b>a</b> <b>bass</b> clarinet plays about one octave lower.|$|E

5|$|The group {{continued}} their Casbah residency {{into the new}} year, occasionally securing other gigs. In January, Brown grew ill {{and was unable to}} play the show. Best, however, insisted that the Quarrymen still pay Brown, but Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison refused; the incident resulted in the loss of their residency at the Casbah and Brown's departure from the group. Shortly after, however, Lennon convinced fellow art school student Stuart Sutcliffe to purchase <b>a</b> <b>bass</b> guitar and join the group. The group had no bookings, but began rehearsing vigorously to allow the musical novice Sutcliffe practice on his new instrument.|$|E

In response he bought a £5 acoustic guitar from a junk-shop near the Dublin quays, and began learning elementary chords and songs. John Leslie, who shared a bunk bed with Clayton at St. Columba's, persuaded him to join in with a school band where Clayton would play the bass guitar for the first time.

5|$|DecembeRadio played {{its last}} concert on November 8, 2012. No {{announcement}} of the band's dissolution was ever made, but in 2013 the three remaining members formed a secular country music trio called JEBtown, which played at least one show in Nashville and filmed a music video for a studio track. By 2014, the band members had {{moved on to other}} projects. Josh Reedy toured as <b>a</b> <b>bass</b> player with Chris Cagle, then joined Thomas Rhett's band as a keyboardist and guitarist. Brian Bunn had a stint as a touring guitarist with Third Day, then joined Reedy in Rhett's band.

5|$|During a gig with a {{stand-in}} drummer in late April at the Oldfield, {{the band}} first met Keith Moon. Moon {{grew up in}} Wembley, and had been drumming in bands since 1961. He was performing with a semi-professional band called the Beachcombers, and wanted to play full-time. Moon played a few songs with the group, breaking <b>a</b> <b>bass</b> drum pedal and tearing a drum skin. The band were impressed with his energy and enthusiasm, and offered him the job. Moon performed with the Beachcombers a few more times, but dates clashed and he chose to devote himself to the Who. The Beachcombers auditioned Sandom, but were unimpressed and did not ask him to join.|$|E
5|$|On June 29, 2014, in an {{interview}} to Totalrock radio, Duff McKagan talked to Hayley Leggs in Clisson France about {{the subject of a}} new lead vocalist for Velvet Revolver and revealed that there had been at least one audition for the role of lead vocalist, but said that the person that they auditioned did not properly impress the remaining members of the band. He also ruled himself out of being the lead vocalist of Velvet Revolver due to the experiences he has had of being the vocalist of his own band Loaded, saying that being the lead vocalist and being <b>a</b> <b>bass</b> player at the same time was not as appealing to him because it would require him to be much more static in his stage presence, saying that he prefers moving around on stage during live performances. In the same interview, McKagan talked about his new book which was then in the writing stages.|$|E

5|$|The introduction's {{keyboard}} fantasia gradually {{opens the}} band's languid, expansive interplay. The song's groove is established {{with the introduction}} of <b>a</b> <b>bass</b> guitar ostinato at 4:50. Rhythm and tenor guitars and a horn section are played in the next two minutes. During the bridge, Allen's drumming intensifies within the song's seven-minute mark, which leads to a fully developed Afrobeat section; Afrobeat is a type of loose funk music embellished with African syncopation, R-styled horn instrumentation, and improvisatory solos. Confusions extended mid-tempo section has complex arrangements of danceable grooves, multiple solos, and Allen's polyrhythms. In this section, Kuti plays tenor saxophone, which he had learned after the 's original tenor player, Igo Chico, left in 1973. The music is complemented by his outspoken call-and-response vocal passages. The song's final 10 minutes comprise raucous trumpet, tenor saxophone solos, and Kuti's lead vocals. Its closing section revisits the abstract interplay of the introduction.|$|E

5|$|The {{orchestra}} frequently {{includes two}} clarinetists playing individual parts—each player is usually {{equipped with a}} pair of standard clarinets in B and A, and clarinet parts commonly alternate between B and A instruments several times {{over the course of a}} piece, or less commonly, a movement (e.g., 1st movement Brahms' 3rd symphony). Clarinet sections grew larger during the last few decades of the 19th century, often employing a third clarinetist, an E or <b>a</b> <b>bass</b> clarinet. In the 20th century, composers such as Igor Stravinsky, Richard Strauss, Gustav Mahler, and Olivier Messiaen enlarged the clarinet section on occasion to up to nine players, employing many different clarinets including the E or D soprano clarinets, basset horn, alto clarinet, bass clarinet, and/or contrabass clarinet.|$|E
2500|$|The {{bass drum}} (also {{known as the}} [...] "kick drum") {{provides}} a regular but often-varied foundation to the rhythm. The bass drum is the lowest pitched drum and usually provides the basic beat or timing element with basic pulse patterns. Some drummers may use two or more bass drums or use <b>a</b> double <b>bass</b> drum pedal with <b>a</b> single <b>bass</b> drum. Double <b>bass</b> drumming is <b>an</b> important technique in many heavy metal genres. Using <b>a</b> double <b>bass</b> drum pedal enables a drummer to play <b>a</b> double <b>bass</b> drum style with only one bass drum, saving space in recording/performance areas and reducing time and effort during set-up, taking down, and transportation.|$|R
