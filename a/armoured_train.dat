5|$|On 17 March {{the whole}} brigade {{was ordered to}} deploy to assist the civil {{authorities}} dealing with growing unrest among the Egyptian civilian population. The regiment moved to the Nile Delta on 23 March, forming a column with four armoured cars and an <b>armoured</b> <b>train.</b> Any one found rioting was arrested and tried {{in front of a}} court headed by the commanding-officer, who also imposed sentences. Within weeks the rioting was quelled and the regiment returned to their camp, remaining there until 17 June when they were ordered to send their horses to the remount depot and move to Ismailia on the Suez Canal. On 30 June they embarked on the transport ship HMNZT Ulimaroa for New Zealand and the regiment was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The Ponte Grande Bridge was {{immediately}} outside the area defended by the Italian 206 Coastal Division, which would oppose the British seaborne landing. The fortress commander was Rear Admiral Priamo Leonardi, with Colonel Mario Damiani {{in command of}} the army contingent. The Augusta-Syracuse Naval Fortress Area, which included the Coastal Division, was protected by six medium and six heavy coastal artillery batteries, with eleven additional dual-purpose coastal and anti-aircraft batteries, with six batteries only of anti-aircraft guns. Finally the Fortress contained an <b>armoured</b> <b>train</b> with four 120mm guns. The army contingent was the 121st Coastal Defence Regiment, which included four battalions. There were also naval and air force battalions available, while the 54 Infantry Division Napoli {{was in a position to}} send reinforcements if required.|$|E

5000|$|Early in the 20th century, Russia used <b>armoured</b> <b>trains</b> {{during the}} Russo-Japanese War. [...] <b>Armoured</b> <b>trains</b> {{went on to}} see use during the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920) and World War I (1914-1918). The most {{intensive}} use of <b>armoured</b> <b>trains</b> was during the Russian Civil War (1918-1920). The Spanish Civil War saw a little use of <b>armoured</b> <b>trains,</b> though World War II (1939-1945) saw more. The French used them during the First Indochina War (1946-1954), {{and a number of}} countries had <b>armoured</b> <b>trains</b> during the Cold War. The last combat use appears to have been during the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s.|$|R

5|$|Murray {{considered}} it very unlikely that an attack would occur anywhere {{other than in}} the northern sector and therefore was prepared to reduce the troops in Nos 1 and 2 Sectors to a minimum. He decided not to reinforce his four infantry brigades, but to increase the available fire-power at Romani by moving up the 160th and 161st Machine Gun Companies of the 53rd (Welsh) and the 54th (East Anglian) Divisions. He also ordered the concentration of a small mobile column {{made up of the}} 11th Light Horse, the City of London Yeomanry (less one squadron each) with the 4th, 6th and 9th Companies of the Imperial Camel Brigade in No. 2 Sector. He calculated that the whole of the defensive force, including the camel transport necessary to enable infantry in the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division to advance into the desert, would be fully equipped and the camels assembled by 3 August. Approximately 10,000 Egyptian Camel Transport Corps camels concentrated at Romani prior to the battle. British monitors in the Mediterranean Sea off Mahamdiyah got into position to shell the assembling Ottoman force, while an <b>armoured</b> <b>train</b> at Kantara was ready to assist the defence of the right flank, and all available aircraft were on standby at Ismailia, Kantara, Port Said and Romani.|$|E

50|$|The Bolshevik {{forces in}} the Russian civil war used {{a wide range of}} <b>armoured</b> <b>trains.</b> Many were improvised by locals, others were {{constructed}} by naval engineers at the Putilov and Izhorskiy factories. As a result, the trains ranged from little more than sandbagged flatbeds to the heavily armed and <b>armoured</b> <b>trains</b> produced by the naval engineers. An attempt to standardise the design from October 1919 only had limited success. By {{the end of the war}} the Bolshevik forces had 103 <b>armoured</b> <b>trains</b> of all types.|$|R

5000|$|Poland used <b>armoured</b> <b>trains</b> {{extensively}} {{during the}} Invasion of Poland. One observer noted that [...] "Poland had only few <b>armoured</b> <b>trains,</b> but their officers and soldiers were fighting well. Again and again they were {{emerging from a}} cover in thick forests, disturbing German lines". One under-appreciated aspect of so many Polish <b>armoured</b> <b>trains</b> being deployed during the Polish Defensive War in 1939 is that when German planes attacked the railroads, it was usually the tracks themselves. As late as September 17, three fresh divisions in the east were moved westward by train. On September 18, three more divisions followed.|$|R

25|$|The Reds {{launched}} their first offensive against Vilppula on 2 February {{with the support}} of Russian troops and an <b>armoured</b> <b>train.</b> The Whites had built a defensive line behind the two bridges crossing the river Vilppulankoski. During the next five days, the Reds attacked several times, but all efforts failed. As they got reinforcements from the Helsinki Red Guard and the Saint Petersburg Finnish Red Guard, three more attacks were made in the next two weeks, but the Reds could not break through.|$|E
25|$|Promoted to captain on 20 April 1880, Wilson was {{appointed}} to command the torpedo boat depot ship HMS Hecla. In the Summer of 1882 {{he was ordered to}} take the Hecla to Egypt to deliver ammunition for British troops taking part in the Anglo-Egyptian War; on arrival, working with Captain John Fisher, he installed a heavy gun on a railway carriage and created an improvised <b>armoured</b> <b>train.</b> He was awarded the Ottoman Empire Order of the Medjidie, 3rd Class on 12 January 1883.|$|E
50|$|Armoured trams also existed, {{although}} {{apparently not}} purpose-built {{as some of}} the <b>armoured</b> <b>trains.</b> The just-formed Red Army used at least one armoured tram during the fighting for Moscow in the October Revolution in 1917. The Slovak National Uprising, more well known for its <b>armoured</b> <b>trains</b> described above, also used at least one makeshift example.|$|R

25|$|By Saturday, up to 1,000 rebels {{had been}} mobilised, and a {{detachment}} {{was sent to}} occupy the nearby village of Ferns. In Wexford, the British assembled a column of 1,000 soldiers (including the Connaught Rangers), two field guns and a 4.7 inch naval gun on a makeshift <b>armoured</b> <b>train.</b> On Sunday, the British sent messengers to Enniscorthy, informing the rebels of Pearse's surrender order. However, the Volunteer officers were skeptical. Two of them were escorted by the British to Arbour Hill Prison, where Pearse confirmed the surrender order.|$|E
25|$|On 21 February, the Red general {{offensive}} was launched, but the Vilppula Reds did {{not join}} the attack as the White artillery had stopped their <b>armoured</b> <b>train.</b> Fighting settled down, both sides now focused in firing each other with artillery. On 13 March, the Reds performed a peculiar operation as they loaded a train full of explosives and sent it towards the Vilppula station. The ghost train ran over the roadblocks and finally stopped at the rail yard, where the Whites managed to make the overpressured locomotive harmless and prevent the explosion.|$|E
25|$|In 1940 {{the railway}} {{was taken over}} by the {{military}} during World War II, and a miniature <b>armoured</b> <b>train</b> was used on the line. It was also used by the Department of Petroleum Warfare in the construction of PLUTO ("Pipe Line Under The Ocean") intended to supply fuel to the Allied forces after the D-Day Normandy landings. During the latter stages of the construction of PLUTO considerable damage was caused to the track on the extension when, to speed up the work, lengths of pipe were dragged along the trackbed by bulldozers, resulting in its reduction to a single track after the war.|$|E

25|$|Fighting erupted {{along the}} {{northern}} edge of the city centre on Tuesday afternoon. In the northeast, British troops left Amiens Street railway station in an <b>armoured</b> <b>train,</b> to secure and repair a section of damaged tracks. They were attacked by rebels who had taken up position at Annesley Bridge. After a two-hour battle, the British were forced to retreat and several soldiers were captured. At Phibsborough, in the northwest, rebels had occupied buildings and erected barricades at junctions on the North Circular Road. The British summoned 18-pounder field artillery from Athlone and shelled the rebel positions, destroying the barricades. After a fierce firefight, the rebels withdrew. They later made an unsuccessful attack on troops at Broadstone railway station.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 April, the Germans reached the harbour by the VesijÃ¤rvi lake. At {{the same time the}} Finnish White Army division, {{commanded}} by the Estonian major Hans Kalm, entered the town from north as the Reds on the RadiomÃ¤ki hill had surrendered. The German commander colonel Otto von Brandenstein and Hans Kalm greet each other in a modest ceremony held in the Lahti main street. On the next day, a small clash occurred as a group of 1,000 Red Guard fighters came by <b>armoured</b> <b>train</b> to Okeroinen, a village in Hollola, 5 kilometres south of Lahti. The Reds tried to break into the town but were pushed back. During the first two days of the battle, the Germans lost six men killed. Red losses were at least 37 killed and 500 captured. 300 more were captured within next three days as the Germans searched Reds from their homes. The ones found with a fired rifle were shot.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} day, the Armenian vanguard pushed against Sadakhlo, where general Tsulukdize's forces had {{fortified}} {{themselves at the}} station and nearby strategic heights. The initial Armenian attack was repulsed, {{and in order to}} outflank the defenders, the town of Shulaveri was captured the next day. Colonel Korolkov called for all Armenian men in the area, able to fight, to mobilize and support the army's offensive. On 20 December, the Armenians were blockading a vital train station that connected Sadakhlo with Tbilisi preventing further reinforcements. A day after, they massed all their artillery guns and launched an attack on the town, only to be repulsed with heavy casualties by the defenders who were equipped with an <b>armoured</b> <b>train.</b> Using the same train, the remaining Georgian troops broke out of the encirclement to join a defensive line further north. Following that defeat, Tsulukidze resigned and got replaced by general Sumbatashvili. The Georgian army was already mobilizing in the Lori district and started to prepare for major counterattacks.|$|E
