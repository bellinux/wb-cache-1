[...] Walter Chaw from Film Freak Central said the show was [...] "so odious, so repugnant, that it's impossible not to have predicted its newly-minted role as the most popular program in the land." [...] The Washington Posts Tom Shales was critical of the early series, finding it reminiscent of ER and commenting that: [...] "The show is much {{more a matter of}} commercial calculation than an honest attempt to try something fresh and different". He called Rhimes' script for the pilot episode [...] "nothing but <b>a</b> <b>casserole</b> made of equal parts ham and corn", writing that overall: [...] "It's a 'new' show only in the sense that Dr. Frankenstein's monster was a new man." [...] Kate Aurthur for The New York Times deemed the show a hybrid of Ally McBeal, Sex and the City and ER, writing of the news that it had become the highest-rated midseason drama in 12 years that: [...] "When you parse its ratings, Grey's Anatomy underscores one of the real lessons of the current season - men will watch shows with a female lead.
