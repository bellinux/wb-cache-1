This {{magnetic field}} is induced by <b>an</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> the ionosphere and the solar wind, rather than by an internal dynamo as in the Earth's core. Venus's small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against cosmic radiation.|$|E
5|$|Close {{examination}} of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, which is <b>an</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This {{is caused by the}} interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the Stark effect.|$|E

The ninth tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the season, Isis developed on September 1 from <b>an</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> a tropical wave and a large surface circulation to the southwest of Mexico. It moved northward, striking the extreme southeastern portion of the Baja California peninsula before attaining hurricane status in the Gulf of California. Isis made landfall at Topolobampo in the Mexican state of Sinaloa on September 3, and quickly lost its low-level circulation. The remnants persisted for several days before dissipating in the U.S. state of Idaho.|$|E

30|$|It is {{important}} to consider that the concentration and time of application adopted for the Biosillicate® solution in this study most likely facilitated the initial reaction with dentin. In addition to the chemical <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> the substrates through the formation of apatite, the phenomenon may have created <b>a</b> mechanical <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> the bioglass and dentin particles, increasing adhesion between the substrates [12].
