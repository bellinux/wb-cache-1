25|$|In October 2007, McTell {{released}} an 'audio book' titled <b>As</b> <b>Far</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> Tell. The three CDs included readings from the autobiography interspersed with new {{recordings of the}} songs they inspired. The <b>As</b> <b>Far</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> Tell treble CD was promoted by a tour that included a concert at St Mary’s church in Banbury, a location that featured in {{the first volume of}} autobiography.|$|E
25|$|During 2008, McTell {{combined}} the two volumes of his autobiography {{into a single}} volume under the title <b>As</b> <b>Far</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> Tell for publication to coincide with his autumn tour. The new edition featured additional chapters illustrated by photos from the May family album.|$|E

25|$|After their Defeat the Rebels {{retired to}} the Isle aux Noix, where they {{continued}} till lately, sending out some Parties, and many Emissaries, to debauch the Minds of the Canadians and Indians, {{in which they}} have proved too successful, and for which they were too well prepared by the Cabals and Intrigues of these two last years; We knew of their being reinforced, and very considerably, I suppose, as they appeared in Numbers near St. John's last Sunday Evening; where or when they landed, or the Particulars since, we have but very imperfect Accounts of, all Communications with the Forts of St. John's and Chambli, being, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> find, entirely cut off.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see, it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E
500|$|Customarily the ship's surgeon {{took the}} {{position}} of naturalist, and the Beagles surgeon Robert McCormick sought fame and fortune as an explorer. When they first met {{at the start of}} the voyage, Darwin had commented that [...] "My friend [...] is an ass, but we jog on very amicably". They walked into the countryside of St. Jago together, and Darwin, influenced by Lyell, found the surgeon's approach old-fashioned. They found a remarkable baobab tree, which FitzRoy measured and sketched. Darwin went on subsequent [...] "riding expeditions" [...] with Benjamin Bynoe and Rowlett to visit Ribeira Grande and St Domingo. FitzRoy extended their stay to 23 days, to complete his measurements of magnetism. Darwin subsequently wrote to Henslow that his collecting included [...] "several specimens of an Octopus, which possessed a most marvellous power of changing its colours; equalling any chamaelion, & evidently accommodating the changes to the colour of the ground which it passed over.—yellowish green, dark brown & red were the prevailing colours: this fact appears to be new, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> find out." [...] Henslow replied that [...] "The fact is not new, but any fresh observations will be highly important." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite Steiger's acclaim as an actor, he was {{frequently}} accused of overacting and won his {{fair share of}} critics, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. His acting was so dynamic at times that critics found him excessive and overbearing, and even uncomfortable or laughable to watch. Steiger once clashed with Armenian director Rouben Mamoulian, during a theatrical production of Oklahoma!, as he was intolerant of Steiger's [...] "unusual acting technique". Steiger ignored the director's concerns that he was mumbling his lines, and when he began chomping loudly on an apple during a scene with Gordon MacRae, Mamoulian exclaimed: [...] "Get out of my theater. Get out of my life!", and fired him. Even Kazan found several of the Actors Studio's techniques disagreeable, preferring [...] "more humor and verve and less self-indulgence, self-pity and self-awareness". Kazan felt that Steiger often displayed a competitive edge as an actor and tried to steal scenes from his co-stars. Steiger rejected these claims, insisting that he was merely [...] "trying to take the medium of acting to <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> go, and that why I sometimes go over the edge".|$|E
500|$|Although her {{research}} was progressing at Missouri, McClintock was {{not satisfied with}} her position at the University. She recalled being excluded from faculty meetings, and was not made aware of positions available at other institutions. In 1940, she wrote to Charles Burnham, [...] "I have decided that I must look for another job. <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make out, {{there is nothing more}} for me here. I am an assistant professor at $3,000 and I feel sure that that is the limit for me." [...] Initially, McClintock's position was created especially for her by Stadler, and might have depended on his presence at the university. McClintock believed she would not gain tenure at Missouri, even though according to some accounts, she knew she would be offered a promotion from Missouri in the spring of 1942. Recent evidence reveals that McClintock more likely decided to leave Missouri because she had lost trust in her employer and in the University administration, after discovering that her job would be in jeopardy if Stadler were to leave for Caltech, as he had considered doing. The university's retaliation against Stadler amplified her sentiments.|$|E

2500|$|Writing as Archie Goodwin, Ken Darby {{suggests}} that [...] "the actual location was on East 22nd Street in the Gramercy Park District. … Wolfe merely moved us, fictionally, {{from one place}} to the other in order to preserve his particular brand of privacy. <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> discover, there never were brownstone houses on West 35th Street." ...|$|E

It is clear that he is not quite at ease about him, tho' <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see determined not to abandon him. ... The combat in his mind between the candid interpretation of his friend's actions, and his own conviction deprives him of half the benefit of his understanding.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, Searle gave a {{brief reply}} to Derrida in The Construction of Social Reality. He called Derrida's {{conclusion}} [...] "preposterous" [...] {{and stated that}} [...] "Derrida, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tell, {{does not have an}} argument. He simply declares that there is nothing outside of texts..." [...] Searle's reference here is not to anything forwarded in the debate, but to a mistranslation of the phrase [...] "il n'y a pas de hors-texte" [...] ("there is no outside-text") which appears in Derrida's Of Grammatology (1967).|$|E

2500|$|<b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{see there}} is no {{difference}} between a firing squad, an electric chair, a gas chamber, or hanging. Death is death and I would interpret the shedding of man's blood in legal executions as a figurative expression which means the taking of life. There {{seems to me to be}} no present significance as to whether an execution is by a firing squad or in some other way. I, of course, deleted my article on [...] "hanging" [...] from the Second Edition of Mormon Doctrine because of the reasoning here mentioned.|$|E
2500|$|Ai Ogawa (October 21, 1947 – March 20, 2010), born as Florence Anthony, was an American {{poet and}} educator. She won the 1999 National Book Award for Poetry for Vice: New and Selected Poems. Ai {{is known for}} her mastery of the {{dramatic}} monologue as a poetic form, {{as well as for}} taking on dark, controversial topics in her work. [...] About writing in the dramatic monologue form, she’s said: “I want to take the narrative ‘persona’ poem <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> and I've never been one to do things in halves. All the way or nothing. I won't abandon that desire.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Hunter R. Rawlings III, President of the {{prominent}} Association of American Universities research group of universities to which UVA is an elected member, came to Charlottesville {{to make a}} speech to university faculty which included a statement about the proposal: [...] "there's no possibility, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see, that any state will ever relinquish its ownership and governance of its public universities, much less of its flagship research university". He encouraged university leaders to stop talking about privatization and instead push their state lawmakers to increase funding for higher education and research as a public good.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{occasional}} {{claims that}} Sky News may be inherently biased {{due to the}} fact that it is majority-owned by 21st Century Fox; most of 21st Century Fox's (and News Corp, in which Rupert Murdoch also has an ownership interest) news outlets have an openly conservative or right-wing outlook. In a 2010 article in the New Statesman, prominent journalist and broadcaster Mehdi Hasan argued that [...] "in style and in substance, of course, it is nothing like the pro-war, pro-Republican, pro-Palin Fox News Channel...
