5|$|Australia reached 3/135 when Miller and Arthur Morris {{departed}} {{in quick}} succession. With Sid Barnes retiring hurt {{because of a}} blow to the ribs, Tallon came in at 5/139, effectively six wickets down and made 18 in half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> falling at 6/172. Australia managed to reach 221 and avoid the follow on.|$|E

5|$|The Sinclair {{method is}} a method of using {{naltrexone}} or another opioid antagonists to treat alcoholism by having the person take the medication about <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> they drink alcohol, and only then.

5|$|At 1.15 pm, Parker {{was waiting}} outside the harbour with the reserve {{and raised a}} signal {{ordering}} Nelson to withdraw. Nelson acknowledged the signal but ignored it, while Nelson's second in command, Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves, repeated the signal but too did not obey it. Riou now {{found himself in a}} difficult position. Too junior an officer to risk disobeying a direct order, he remained in action for a further half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> reluctantly giving the order for his small squadron to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Birdwood {{planned to}} arrive off the {{peninsula}} after the moon had set, {{with the first}} troops landing at 03:30, <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> dawn.

5|$|Following Spies' speech, {{the crowd}} was {{addressed}} by Parsons, the Alabama-born editor of the radical English-language weekly The Alarm. The crowd was so calm that Mayor Carter Harrison Sr., who had stopped by to watch, walked home early. Parsons spoke for almost <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> standing down {{in favor of the}} last speaker of the evening, the British socialist Samuel Fielden, who delivered a brief ten-minute address. Many of the crowd had already left as the weather was deteriorating.|$|E
5|$|The Daily Show {{typically}} tapes {{four new}} episodes a week, Monday through Thursday, forty-two weeks a year. The show is broadcast at 11 PM Eastern/10 PM Central, {{a time when}} local television stations show their news reports and about half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> most other late-night comedy programs begin {{to go on the}} air. The program is rerun several times the next day, including a 7:30 PM Eastern/6:30 PM Central prime time broadcast.|$|E
5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{produces}} {{a variety of}} calls, including a piping call around half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> dawn, variously described as ki-owt, woik, queet, peet, or weet. Through the day, it makes squeaking noises while flying, and harsh squawks when mobbing. Its calls have been likened {{to those of the}} yellow-throated miner (Manorina flavigula), but are deeper. Blue-faced honeyeaters make a soft chirping around nestlings and family members.|$|E

5|$|The savage hand-to-hand {{fighting}} in the railway buildings and sidings lasted for more than <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> the light horsemen captured the area. Over 20 Ottoman and German soldiers {{were killed in the}} station buildings alone during the fighting. At the same time, 'C' Squadron, of the 11th Light Horse Regiment, and/or one squadron of the 12th Light Horse Regiment, moved up into the village of Samakh and captured the town during less severe fighting.|$|E
5|$|According {{to church}} doctrine, the sacraments {{of the church}} require the proper form, matter, and intent to be validly {{celebrate}}d. In addition, the Canon Laws for both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches govern who may licitly celebrate certain sacraments, as well as strict rules about who may receive the sacraments. Notably, because the Church teaches that Christ {{is present in the}} Eucharist, those who are conscious of being in a state of mortal sin are forbidden to receive the sacrament until they have received absolution through the sacrament of Reconciliation (Penance). Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating for at least <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> receiving the sacrament. Non-Catholics such are ordinarily prohibited from receiving the Eucharist as well.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} peace was {{completely}} restored in the city, {{the cost to}} the state for suppression of the mob was between $80,000 and $85,000. Later that year, the B agreed to a number of reforms: crewmen would not be called to work more than <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> a train's departure, crews were to be paid a quarter of a day's pay if the train they were working was canceled, and passes were to be given for men working who had long layovers. In 1880, the B Employees Relief Association was established.|$|E

5|$|Driving to the Emirates Stadium is {{strongly}} discouraged {{as there are}} strict matchday parking restrictions in operation around the stadium. <b>An</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> kick-off to one hour after the final whistle there is a complete ban on vehicle movement {{on a number of}} the surrounding roads, except for Islington residents and businesses with a road closure access permit. The parking restrictions mean that the stadium is highly dependent on the Underground service, particularly when there is no overground service in operation. Industrial action forced Arsenal to reschedule the match for the following month.|$|E
5|$|During its flyby of Amalthea, the Galileo orbiter's star scanner {{detected}} nine flashes {{that appear}} to be small moonlets near the orbit of Amalthea. Because they were sighted only from one location, their true distances could not be measured. These moonlets may be anywhere in size from gravel to stadium-sized. Their origins are unknown, but they may be gravitationally captured into current orbit or they may be ejecta from meteor impacts on Amalthea. On the next and final orbit (just <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> destruction), Galileo detected one more such moonlet. However, this time Amalthea {{was on the other side}} of the planet, so it is probable that the particles form a ring around the planet near Amalthea's orbit.|$|E
5|$|Each side's {{front line}} was {{constantly}} under observation by snipers and lookouts during daylight; movement was therefore restricted {{until after the}} dusk stand-to and night had fallen. Under the cover of darkness, troops attended to vital maintenance and resupply, with rations and water being brought to the front line, fresh units swapped places with troops moving to the rear for rest and recuperation. Trench raiding was also carried out and construction parties formed to repair trenches and fortifications, while wiring parties were sent out to repair or renew the barbed wire in no man's land. <b>An</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> dawn, everyone would stand-to once more.|$|E
