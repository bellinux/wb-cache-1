5|$|In 1920, {{commemorative}} coins {{were not}} {{sold by the}} government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, usually designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase them <b>at</b> <b>face</b> <b>value</b> and vend them {{to the public at}} a premium. Although not mentioned in the legislation, {{in the case of the}} Alabama Centennial half dollar, the centennial commission was the authorized group.|$|E
5|$|Model's true {{opinion on}} the value of the {{offensive}} remains unclear. Manstein took his recommendation <b>at</b> <b>face</b> <b>value,</b> while Guderian said that he was categorically against attacking. It has similarly been suggested that Model, in fact, hoped to scuttle the operation by causing it to be delayed until the Soviet forces launched their own attack.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} some dispute over {{the extent to which}} Kierkegaard {{influenced}} Bohr's philosophy and science. David Favrholdt argued that Kierkegaard had minimal influence over Bohr's work, taking Bohr's statement about disagreeing with Kierkegaard <b>at</b> <b>face</b> <b>value,</b> while Jan Faye argued that one can disagree with the content of a theory while accepting its general premises and structure.|$|E
50|$|With scrip fundraising, {{retailers}} offer {{gift cards}} (“scrip”, or “substitute money”) {{at a discount}} to non-profit organizations. The non-profit organizations then sell the gift cards to member families <b>at</b> full <b>face</b> <b>value.</b> The families redeem the gift cards <b>at</b> full <b>face</b> <b>value,</b> and the discount or rebate is retained by the non-profit organization as revenue.|$|R
5000|$|Buy {{that card}} <b>at</b> its <b>face</b> <b>value,</b> by paying money from their {{stockpile}} of cash to the bank; ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the term scrip evolved {{to include a}} {{fundraising}} method popular with non-profit organizations like schools, bands and athletic groups. With scrip fundraising, retailers offer the gift certificates and gift cards to non-profit organizations at a discount. The non-profit organizations sell the gift cards to member's families <b>at</b> full <b>face</b> <b>value.</b> The families redeem the gift cards <b>at</b> full <b>face</b> <b>value,</b> and the discount or rebate is retained by the non-profit organization as revenue.|$|R
5|$|Islamic philosopher Carl Ernst {{has argued}} that {{religious}} language is often political, especially in the public sphere, and that its purpose is to persuade people and establish authority, as well as convey information. He explains that the modern criticisms of the West made by some sections of Islam are an ideological reaction to colonialism, which intentionally uses the same language as colonialists. Ernst argues that when it is used rhetorically, religious language cannot be taken <b>at</b> <b>face</b> <b>value</b> because of its political implications.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{theory to}} Syme's {{has been put}} forward by François Paschoud, who claimed that Maximus was {{probably}} a satirical poet, {{in the same vein}} as Juvenal and not an imperial biographer at all. His argument rests on the point that, outside of the mentions in the History, the only extant referencing of Marius' work is always in the context of Juvenal, and that the History's description of him as a historian cannot be taken <b>at</b> <b>face</b> <b>value,</b> given how it invents or distorts so many other citations. This theory is rejected by historians such as Anthony Birley and David Rohrbacher.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 100,058 Illinois Centennial half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint during August 1918, with the excess over the round number {{reserved}} for {{inspection and testing}} at the 1919 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. There was no official packaging; a few were used in badges for the Illinois Centennial Commission. The coins were not publicized much outside Illinois. The centennial commission distributed them, <b>at</b> <b>face</b> <b>value,</b> to its county affiliates in proportion to their share of Illinois' population, on condition they be sold at a premium {{to help pay for}} local celebrations, and if one had already been held, for war relief.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} {{appears to}} have exceeded its estimated cost, for in 1888 debentures were redeemed by a preference share issue <b>at</b> a <b>face</b> <b>value</b> of £28,241.|$|R
25|$|The U.S. Government, however, {{has taken}} the {{position}} that paying debts with such coins <b>at</b> their <b>face</b> <b>value,</b> where the <b>face</b> <b>value</b> is lower than its intrinsic value, will implicate money laundering and tax evasion statutes.|$|R
60|$|Although the {{investigators}} seemed {{to accept his}} statements <b>at</b> their <b>face</b> <b>value,</b> the assistant general manager was far from being assured that their final report would redound to his credit.|$|R
5|$|Before the 20th century, and in {{some cases}} as late as the 1940s, historians largely took ancient {{literary}} sources <b>at</b> <b>face</b> <b>value</b> as evidence for the lives of women in the ancient world. In the middle of the 20th century this began to change. Early innovations in the study of women in ancient history began in France, as the Annales School began to take a greater interest in underrepresented groups. Robert Flacelière was an influential early author on women in Greece. Around the same time, feminist philosophy, such as Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex also examined the lives of women in the classical world.|$|E
5|$|Gore's {{windfall}} was realized when in 1790 the United States Congress, {{acting on}} a proposal made by Alexander Hamilton and supported by Gore's friend Rufus King, passed legislation that exchanged Continental and state paper for new U.S. paper <b>at</b> <b>face</b> <b>value.</b> Not only did Gore win on this exchange, but the paper he received appreciated in value before he sold it. The exact amount he made is unclear from the surviving documents: John Quincy Adams wrote that Gore's speculations made him the wealthiest lawyer in the country.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, a large {{quantity}} of unissued Morgan dollars {{was discovered in}} the Treasury vaults, including issues once thought rare. Individuals began purchasing large quantities of the pieces <b>at</b> <b>face</b> <b>value,</b> and eventually the Treasury ceased exchanging silver certificates for silver coin. Beginning in the 1970s, the Treasury conducted a sale of silver dollars minted at the Carson City Mint through the General Services Administration. In 2006, Morgan's reverse design was used on a silver dollar issued to commemorate the old San Francisco Mint building.|$|E
50|$|Taken <b>at</b> its <b>face</b> <b>value,</b> the {{commercial}} portrays {{a dangerous situation}} for a senior, with perhaps dire consequences: an elderly person suddenly incapacitated at home, unable to get help, perhaps for hours or even days.|$|R
5000|$|The 7% {{of bonds}} {{held by the}} [...] "Holdout" [...] {{bondholders}} had to be paid <b>at</b> full <b>face</b> <b>value,</b> whereas the other 93% had agreed to be repaid around 30% of the bonds' face value; ...|$|R
5000|$|Any {{repayments}} to the holdouts {{related to}} full <b>face</b> <b>value</b> would potentially trigger all earlier bondholders being entitled to repayments <b>at</b> full <b>face</b> <b>value</b> as well, effectively unwinding the entire {{intent of the}} renegotiations of 2000 - 2010, and creating an extra liability of $100 billion that Argentina {{could not afford to}} incur.|$|R
5|$|Nevertheless, Coolidge {{signed the}} bill, {{which became the}} Act of February 24, 1925, authorizing all three coins. This {{was the first time}} {{commemorative}} coin legislation covered more than one issue. A total of 300,000 for the California piece was authorized, with the coins to be drawn <b>at</b> <b>face</b> <b>value</b> on behalf of the Citizens' Committee by the San Francisco Clearing House Association or the Los Angeles Clearing House Association. The latter group of banks had in 1923 distributed the Monroe Doctrine Centennial half dollar.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{exist that}} Bogdan-Pitești's {{politics}} were already a merger of opposite or hardly compatible doctrines. He respected Catholicism and Judaism {{as the most}} elevated religious cultures, rejected Orthodoxy, atheism and communism as ideologies for the mediocre, and depicted himself as a Catholic anarchist. He believed in craniometry, and took scientific racism <b>at</b> <b>face</b> <b>value.</b> At some stage during the late 1880s, Bogdan-Pitești became a supporter of General Boulanger, who attempted to gain power in France {{with support from the}} Orléanist, Bonapartist and socialist camps; he reputedly befriended the prominent Boulangist and Romantic nationalist thinker Maurice Barrès.|$|E
5|$|The Huguenot-Walloon New Netherland Commission was {{established}} in 1922 {{under the auspices of}} the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America in anticipation of the upcoming anniversary. President Warren G. Harding was the honorary president of the commission, and Belgium's King Albert I accepted an honorary chairmanship. The commission, led by its chairman, Rev. Dr. John Baer Stoudt, planned an observance for the 300th anniversary of the Nieuw Nederlandt voyage, and sought the issuance of commemorative stamps and coins. At the time, commemorative coins were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase the coins <b>at</b> <b>face</b> <b>value</b> and vend them to the public at a premium.|$|E
25|$|American Silver Eagle bullion coins carry a <b>face</b> <b>value</b> of US$1. This {{is their}} legal value {{reflecting}} their issue and monetization as coins. Per , the coins are legal tender for all debts {{public and private}} <b>at</b> their <b>face</b> <b>value.</b> This value does not reflect their intrinsic value which is much greater and is dictated by their silver content and the metal's spot price.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, some debts were {{reinstated}} {{to compensate}} creditors partially for the catastrophic {{reduction in the}} value of debts that had been quoted in paper marks before the hyperinflation. A decree of 1925 reinstated some mortgages <b>at</b> 25% of <b>face</b> <b>value</b> in the new currency, effectively 25,000,000,000 times their value in the old paper marks, if they had been held for at least five years. Similarly, some government bonds were reinstated <b>at</b> 2.5% of <b>face</b> <b>value,</b> to be paid after reparations were paid.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the sparse}} {{evidence}} for the period, many interpretations are possible. Some have taken all the sources <b>at</b> their <b>face</b> <b>value</b> (e.g. Alcock 1971, Morris 1973, Ashe 1985) and others set aside the non-contemporary sources. Any interpretation can only be tentative and dates more so.|$|R
5|$|The United States {{had issued}} {{commemorative}} coins between 1892 and 1954, {{as a means}} for fundraising for organizations deemed worthy of federal support. A sponsoring organization would be designated in the authorizing legislation, and was permitted to buy up the issue <b>at</b> <b>face</b> <b>value,</b> selling it to the public at a premium, and pocketing the difference. Various problems with the issues, including mishandling of distributions and complaints that public coins should not be used for private profit, resulted in firm Treasury Department opposition to such issues, and none were struck after 1954.|$|E
5|$|From 1906 the CLR {{began to}} {{experience}} a large fall in passenger numbers caused by increased competition from the DR and the MR, which electrified the Inner Circle in 1905, and from the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP) which opened its rival route to Hammersmith in 1906. Road traffic also offered a greater challenge as motor buses began replacing the horse drawn variety in greater numbers. In an attempt to maintain income, the company increased the flat fare for longer journeys to three pence in July 1907 and reduced the fare for shorter journeys to one penny in March 1909. Multiple booklets of tickets, which had previously been sold <b>at</b> <b>face</b> <b>value,</b> were offered at discounts, and season tickets were introduced from July 1911.|$|E
5|$|However, {{even where}} {{recognisable}} facts are present, {{their use in}} the History cannot be taken <b>at</b> <b>face</b> <b>value.</b> In the Life of Alexander Severus, the History makes the claim at 24.4 that Alexander had considered banning male prostitution but had decided against making it illegal, although the author added that the emperor Philip did later ban the practice. Although the claim about Alexander is false, the note about Philip is true — {{the source of this}} is Aurelius Victor (28.6–7, and who in turn sourced it from the Kaisergeschichte), and the History even copies Victor's style of moralising asides, which were not in the Kaisergeschichte. Normally, this anecdote would have been included in a Life of Philip, but its absence saw the author include it in another life. This is taken as evidence that the mid-work lacuna is deliberate, as the author was apparently reluctant to abandon any useful material that could be gleaned from the Kaisergeschichte.|$|E
50|$|An accrual bond is a fixed-interest {{bond that}} is issued <b>at</b> its <b>face</b> <b>value</b> and repaid <b>at</b> {{the end of}} the {{maturity}} period together with the accrued interest. In Germany, the accrued interest is compounded. In contrast to zero-coupon bonds, accrual bonds have a clearly stated coupon rate.|$|R
25|$|These bullion coins carry <b>face</b> <b>values</b> of $5, $10, $25, and $50. These {{are their}} legal values {{reflecting}} their issue and monetized value as coins. They are legal tender for all debts {{public and private}} <b>at</b> their <b>face</b> <b>values.</b> These <b>face</b> <b>values</b> do not reflect their intrinsic value which is much greater and is mainly dictated by their troy weight and the current precious metal price. In 2012 the U.S. Mint sold the 2012 one ounce coin ($50 <b>face</b> <b>value)</b> <b>at</b> $1,835.00.|$|R
5000|$|In 1965, Jacob Deschin, camera {{editor of}} the New York Times, wrote about Tices' joint show with Jules Aarons at the {{underground}} Gallery [...] "George A. Tice portrays what he sees <b>at</b> its <b>face</b> <b>value,</b> with emphasis on technical precision and inventiveness." [...] (The New York Times, Apr 4, 1965) ...|$|R
5|$|Protracted {{negotiations}} {{took place}} over House conference negotiations on the bill, revolving in large part around Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield's eventually unsuccessful amendment to tie renewal to a troop withdrawal timetable from Vietnam; during this time the draft law expired and no more were conscripted. On August 5, the Nixon administration pleaded for a renewal before the Senate went on recess, but Gravel blocked Stennis's attempt to limit debate, and no vote was held. Finally on September 21, 1971, the Senate invoked cloture over Gravel's second filibuster attempt by one vote, and then passed the two-year draft extension. Gravel's attempts to stop the draft had failed (notwithstanding Gravel's later claims that he had stopped or shortened the draft, taken <b>at</b> <b>face</b> <b>value</b> in some media reports, during his 2008 presidential campaign).|$|E
5|$|While signing {{modeling}} posters for Jonathan Gold, {{a talent}} agent and professional wrestling promoter, Psaltis jokingly told Gold {{that she would}} be interested in pursuing a career in wrestling. Gold took her comment <b>at</b> <b>face</b> <b>value</b> and later contacted Psaltis, informing her that she was scheduled to appear at a wrestling show in New Jersey. With some trepidation, she went to the show and managed Tony Atlas in his match against Jimmy Snuka. Psaltis made her professional wrestling debut in January 1995. She met her future fiancé Simon Diamond during her time in the independent wrestling promotions. She also met Buddy Landell and Devon Storm, both of whom helped train her. Psaltis spent four years working on the northeastern independent circuit, appearing with promotions such as Maryland Championship Wrestling and the Mid-Eastern Wrestling Federation.|$|E
5|$|Bullion prices {{continued}} to drop through the 1880s, increasing the loss by anyone {{forced to sell}} at melt value after accepting a trade dollar <b>at</b> <b>face</b> <b>value.</b> Despite the support of Secretary of the Treasury Charles J. Folger, {{the question of the}} redemption of the trade dollar became caught up in controversy over the heavy coinage of the new Morgan dollar under the inflationary Bland–Allison Act. Silver interests objected to the silver from redeemed trade dollars being counted towards the Mint's monthly quota under the act, preferring to sell newly mined silver instead, and opposed acts which so provided. It was not until 1887 that Congress, ostensibly to relieve the poor (though most trade dollars were by then in the hands of speculators), provided for the redemption of unmutilated trade dollars. The act, which did not count the redeemed silver towards the Bland–Allison Act quota, passed into law on February 14, 1887, when the ten-day period which President Grover Cleveland had to either sign or veto it expired with no action by the President. Many coins were not redeemable due to chop marks or holes applied by Chinese businessmen, which was done to affirm the coin's silver content. The dollars were only redeemable for six months, and the recovered silver was struck into dimes, quarters, and half dollars.|$|E
50|$|A bond {{selling at}} par is priced <b>at</b> 100% of <b>face</b> <b>value.</b> Par can also {{refer to a}} bond's {{original}} issue value or its value upon redemption at maturity.|$|R
50|$|However, Kalhana's {{account of}} this victory over Yashovarman cannot be taken <b>at</b> the <b>face</b> <b>value.</b> According to {{historian}} Shyam Manohar Mishra (1977), the earlier historians have overrated Lalitaditya's success against Yashovarman: the defeated king acknowledged Lalitaditya's suzerainty for a short period, but became practically independent when Lalitaditya became engaged in other conflicts.|$|R
5000|$|In his 1960 {{book review}} of The Caretaker, fellow English playwright John Arden writes: [...] "Taken purely <b>at</b> its <b>face</b> <b>value</b> this play {{is a study}} of the {{unexpected}} strength of family ties against an intruder." [...] As Arden states, family relationships are one of the main thematic concerns of the play.|$|R
