50|$|Bioterrorism is an {{attractive}} weapon because biological agents are relatively easy and inexpensive to obtain, can be easily disseminated, and can cause widespread fear and panic beyond the <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>damage.</b> Military leaders, however, have learned that, as a military asset, bioterrorism has some important limitations; {{it is difficult to}} employ a bioweapon in a way that only affects the enemy and not friendly forces. A biological weapon is useful to terrorists mainly as a method of creating mass panic and disruption to a state or a country. However, technologists such as Bill Joy have warned of the potential power which genetic engineering might place in the hands of future bio-terrorists.|$|E
40|$|Based on {{experimental}} investigations using {{steel plate}} elements subjected to cyclic uniaxial loading, a continuous damage and/or deteriorating process is examined. In order to describe intermediate {{as well as}} ultimate damage states, energy related criteria for different types of failure modes are suggested. Pure tensile and compressive/tensile bending damage could be distinguished clearly {{on the basis of}} plastic deformation properties. The respective dissipated energies of the investigated specimens are calculated by use of an axial load-displacement coordinate system whose origin is adaptively shifted so as to divide the regions of the two damage contributions. The combination of the considered damage contributions to one single damage index is performed by set theory operations. Calculated damage indices could be correlated fairly well to <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>damage</b> observed during the experimental investigations. 1...|$|E

The current investigation aims to be more comprehensive, by looking at specific technology in actual production, with the aim to create 1) an inventory of substances with potential harm, from PEM fuel cell production, over the system {{in which it is}} used to final disposition, 2) an impact analysis including environmental effects, health effects and less tangible social effects, 3) a damage assessment accounted in terms of <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>damage,</b> 4) an assessment in comparative terms, weighing the different damage contributions on a common scale as far as possible, and 5) suggesting alternative procedures during production, materials choice, conditions of use, and finally decommissioning, that will reduce those impacts deemed critical, eventually by formulating norms and regulation to govern the use of fuel cells in society...|$|E
5000|$|Psychological trauma {{has great}} effects on {{physical}} aspects of patients' brains, {{to the point}} that it can have detrimental effects akin to <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> brain <b>damage.</b> The hippocampus, as mentioned above, is involved in the transference of short-term memories to long-term memories and it is especially sensitive to stress. Stress causes glucocorticoids (GCs), adrenal hormones, to be secreted and sustained exposure to these hormones can cause neural degeneration. The hippocampus is a principal target site for GCs and therefore experiences a severity of neuronal damage that other areas of the brain do not. [...] In severe trauma patients, especially those with post-traumatic stress disorder, the medial prefrontal cortex is volumetrically smaller in size than normal and is hyporesponsive when performing cognitive tasks, which could be a cause of involuntary recollection (intrusive thoughts). [...] The medial prefrontal cortex controls emotional responsiveness and conditioned fear responses to fear-inducing stimuli by interacting with the amygdala. In those cases, the metabolism in some parts of the medial prefrontal cortex didn't activate as they were supposed to when compared to those of a healthy subject.|$|R
50|$|As {{can be seen}} in {{the maps}} of {{earthquake}} activity in this region (shown in the figure on the right), seismicity is scattered throughout most of the New York metropolitan area, with some hint of a concentration of earthquakes in the area surrounding Manhattan Island. The largest known earthquake in this region occurred in 1884 and had a magnitude of approximately 5. For this earthquake, observations of fallen bricks and cracked plaster were reported from eastern Pennsylvania to central Connecticut, and the maximum intensity reported was at two sites in western Long Island (Jamaica, New York and Amityville, New York). Two other earthquakes of approximately magnitude 5 occurred in this region in 1737 and 1783. The figure on the right shows maps of the distribution of earthquakes of magnitude 3 and greater that occurred in this region from 1924 to 2010, along with locations of the larger earthquakes that occurred in 1737, 1783 and 1884. More recently, the 2011 Virginia earthquake, a 5.8 magnitude quake centered in northern Virginia that occurred on August 23, 2011, was felt by the occupants of some buildings in Manhattan, more than 200 miles north of the quake's epicenter and there was some <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> building <b>damage</b> in Brooklyn. There were some disruptions, including building evacuations and delays at airports, while Amtrak train service at Penn Station was also delayed.|$|R
40|$|Virtual creatures {{operating}} in a physically realistic 3 D environment, as originally introduced by Karl Sims, provide a challenging domain for artificial evolution. However, few coevolutionary experiments have been reported. Here we describe {{the results of our}} experiments on the evolution of physical combat among virtual creatures: essentially, we evolve creatures that trade blows with each other. While several authors have involved highly abstract forms of “combat ” in their systems, this is (to our knowledge) the first example of realistic physical combat between virtual creatures, based on <b>actual</b> contact and <b>physical</b> <b>damage.</b> This poses the question of apportioning damage in a collision. Our solution is to assign damage proportionally to how much each colliding limb contributed to the occurrence and depth of the collision. Our system successfully evolves a wide range of morphologies and fighting behaviours, which we describe visually and verbally. As with our previous efforts, our source code is publicly available...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} qualitative research in flood risk areas of England {{that suggests that}} the desire to feel secure can sometimes deter people from taking actions that would reduce the <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>damage</b> of a hazardous natural event. That is, it argues that people sometimes put what Giddens calls their ontological security above their physical security. Preferring to think of their homes as places that are innately safe, they reject the idea of defending them; preferring to think of nature as a positive moral force, they hesitate to {{view it as a}} source of real danger; and preferring to think of society as a competent protector of last resort, they are reluctant to accept the need to protect themselves. Being central to ontological security, such social representations (of ï¿½homeï¿½, ï¿½natureï¿½, ï¿½societyï¿½ etc.) are defended by avoiding perceptual shifts and behaviours that might challenge them. This paper discusses how and why they are defended, what happens when they become indefensible and why some householders and groups of householders are more willing than others to take self-protective actions against risks such as flooding...|$|E
40|$|Dentists, dental hygienists {{and dental}} assistants {{due to the}} nature of their work-related {{physical}} activity often have to deal with physical stress that will cause <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>damage.</b> The aim of the current survey was to analyse the frequency of job-related pain and associated impairment. The questionnaire for the cervical and lumbal region of the North American Spine Society was modified and used in the present investigation. Out of 6962 subjects, 2025 returned the questionnaire (response rate 34. 5 %). Between 20 % and 36 % of the participants suffered from pain in the cervical and lumbal region and were impaired in their daily activities, particularly during the lifting of objects, while standing or sleeping. Almost 40 % of the dentists and 53 % of the dental hygienists/dental assistants experienced problems related to perceived pain during or after dental treatments. More than half of the participants had already sought out medical help and/or physiotherapy due to job-related pain. The present data indicate that prophylactic and therapeutically based preventative measures should be encouraged in order to prevent cervical and back pain in this affected occupational group...|$|E
40|$|Most pains {{from the}} {{locomotor}} system arise due to involuntary, chronic {{tensions in the}} muscles or other tissues. When the patient is motivated, the pain is easily cured {{in most of the}} cases by using the tools of consciousness-based medicine, primarily therapeutic touch, conversation, and coaching the patient in a positive philosophy of life. The pains are often caused by “blockages” that may cause problems other than just pain. Often {{it turns out that the}} blocked areas develop <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>damage</b> over time: a slipped disk in the back, articular degeneration, or osteoarthritis when the cartilage is affected, can often be explained in this way. Apparently, the exact areas where the blockage is situated cause cellular problems, disrupting cellular order. The holistic process theory of healing and the related quality of life theories state that return to the natural state of being is possible, whenever the person gets the resources needed for existential healing. The resources needed are “holding” in the dimensions of awareness, respect, care, acknowledgment, and acceptance with support and processing in the dimensions of feeling, understanding, and letting go of negative attitudes and beliefs. The preconditions for holistic healing are trust and the intention for the healing to take place. Case stories of holistic treatment of patients with chronic back pain, low back pain, muscle problems, knee pain, and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis are discussed with exercises relevant for patients with these conditions in the holistic clinic...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years China has been {{developing}} operational capabilities in the ﬁeld of cyberspace warfare. A cyber attack may be deﬁned as the unauthorized penetration of computer and communications systems belonging to individuals or organizations for the purpose of espionage and information theft, in order thereby to damage or disrupt the functioning of these systems or to damage other systems dependent on them, even to a point of causing <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>damage.</b> Despite denials by the Chinese government, researchers posit that China is behind a string of cyber attacks against the United States, Japan, France, Australia, and other Western nations. This essay argues that an analysis of the publicly available information about the more recent attacks makes it possible to establish that China does in fact stand behind these attacks and also makes it possible to identify the link between China’s cyberspace warfare strategy and its choice of targets. The analysis includes an examination of the companies attacked to identify possible motives for the attacks. The motives for these attacks are presumably to steal capabilities and conduct industrial espionage against nations and commercial competitors. Attacking companies and organizations in the ﬁnancial and even political sectors allows access to valuable intelligence in these ﬁelds. By contrast, the intelligence value for immediate use in attacking companies providing critical infrastructures and communications services is usually relatively low. Rather, gaining access, if only to some providers of communications and internet services in the West and the United States, is liable to give attackers the ability to damage these services...|$|E
40|$|To perform {{computer-aided}} {{assessment of}} the injuries that may result from penetrating trauma, the relationship between human anatomy, physiology, and physical manifestations of injury must be modeled. Since penetrating injury involves <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>damage</b> to regions of the anatomy, any effective method for assessing penetrating injury must {{take into consideration the}} mechanism that produces the injury. However, it may not be possible to accurately capture the extent of damage associated with a mechanism of injury, and there may be only partial information available about patient manifestations of injury. These two problems introduce uncertainty into the assessment process. Assessment of ballistic injuries is further {{complicated by the fact that}} many different entry-to-exit wound pairings are possible when multiple external wounds exist, and the number of possible pairings increases exponentially with the number of external wounds. ^ We address these and other problems in our prototype system, TraumaSCAN, which assesses the effects of penetrating trauma by combining geometric reasoning about potentially injured anatomic structures with abductive reasoning about the consequences of these injuries. Geometric reasoning in TraumaSCAN makes use of 3 D polygonal surface representations of the anatomy and 3 D polygonal surface models of the damage associated with a mechanism of injury. Abductive reasoning is performed with Bayesian networks, which allow us to develop probabilistic causal models of the relationships between anatomic injuries, diseases, and patient findings. Combining geometric and abductive reasoning ensures that knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and manifestations of injury are integrated in the assessment process. Our approach uses probabilities as a means of mediating between the different forms of reasoning, provides a means of initial diagnosis that incorporates the mechanism of injury in a significant way, allows visual exploration of the potential consequences of penetrating injury which complements written feedback, and enables the systematic examination of alternative injury outcomes. We present results obtained from testing TraumaSCAN on a number of actual penetrating trauma cases for which the correct diagnoses are known. ...|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectiveFew {{data are}} {{available}} on the level of <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> activity in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip and knee. The aim {{of this study was to}} measure the level of <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> activity of patients with end-stage OA of the hip and the knee, to compare this with that of matched healthy controls, and to analyze the data in order to ascertain the factors of influence. MethodThe <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> activity was measured with an activity monitor (AM) in 40 hip and 44 knee OA patients, and compared with measurements obtained from healthy controls. Data were also collected on pain and psychological aspects as anxiety, depression and mental functioning. The primary outcome parameter of the <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> activity was the percentage of movement-related activity. ResultsThe percentage of movement-related activity did not differ between the two OA groups. It was 8. 8 (4. 2) % for the hip and 8. 1 (3. 8) % for the knee OA patients. The matched controls were significantly higher movement-related active than OA patients (about 11. 0 (2. 9) %). Increasing age and body mass index were negatively associated with the percentage of movement-related activity (β=− 0. 29 and β=− 0. 25, respectively), whereas mental functioning was positively related (β= 0. 30). ConclusionThe impact of end-stage OA on the level of <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> activity is equal for hip and knee OA patients. The <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> activity for both of the OA groups was significantly and clinically relevantly lower compared to controls. However, this difference was smaller than expected and less dominant than patients' perception of limitations in daily life. Clinicians must be aware that the patients' perception of physical functioning in daily life does not always correspond to the <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> activity...|$|R
