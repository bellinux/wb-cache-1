25|$|Nortel {{initially}} {{hoped to}} re-emerge from bankruptcy, implementing a retention bonus plan {{in an effort}} to retain its top executives during the restructuring period. These bonuses, totaling US$45 million, were targeted at 1,000 executive positions. At the end of January 2009, Nortel announced that it would be discontinuing its WiMAX business and its agreement with Alvarion. Nortel subsequently sold its Layer 4–7 <b>application</b> <b>delivery</b> business to Israeli technology firm Radware for $18 million, after Radware had initially placed a stalking horse bid. Nortel had acquired the application switch product line in October 2000 when it purchased Alteon WebSystems.|$|E

50|$|An <b>application</b> <b>delivery</b> network (ADN) is a {{suite of}} {{technologies}} that, when deployed together, provide application availability, security, visibility, and acceleration. Gartner defines <b>application</b> <b>delivery</b> networking as the combination of WAN optimization controllers (WOCs) and <b>application</b> <b>delivery</b> controllers (ADCs). At the data center end of an ADN is the <b>application</b> <b>delivery</b> controller, an advanced traffic management device that is often {{also referred to as}} a web switch, content switch, or multilayer switch, the purpose of which is to distribute traffic among a number of servers or geographically dislocated sites based on application specific criteria. In the branch office portion of an ADN is the WAN optimization controller, which works {{to reduce the number of}} bits that flow over the network using caching and compression, and shapes TCP traffic using prioritization and other optimization techniques. Some WOC components are installed on PCs or mobile clients, and there is typically a portion of the WOC installed in the data center. <b>Application</b> <b>delivery</b> networks are also offered by some CDN vendors.|$|E

40|$|Peptide self-assembled {{nanostructures}} {{are very}} popular in many biomedical <b>applications.</b> Drug <b>delivery</b> {{is one of the}} most promising applications among them. The tremendous advantages for peptide self-assembled nanostructures include good biocompatibility, low cost, tunable bioactivity, high drug loading capacities, chemical diversity, specific targeting, and stimuli responsive drug delivery at disease sites. Peptide self-assembled nanostructures such as nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanofibers, and hydrogels have been investigated by many researchers for drug <b>delivery</b> <b>applications.</b> In this review, the underlying mechanisms for the self-assembled nanostructures based on peptides with different types and structures are introduced and discussed. Peptide self-assembled nanostructures associated promising drug <b>delivery</b> <b>applications</b> such as anticancer drug and gene drug delivery are highlighted. Furthermore, peptide self-assembled nanostructures for targeted and stimuli responsive drug <b>delivery</b> <b>applications</b> are also reviewed and discussed...|$|R
