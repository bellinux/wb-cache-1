25|$|The KLM was {{designed}} to be a quick and easy to use system design tool, which means that no deep knowledge about psychology is required for its usage. Also, task times can be predicted (given the limitations) without having to build a prototype, recruit and test users, which saves time and money.

25|$|Upon {{agreement}} of <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>design,</b> RTL designers then implement the functional models in a hardware description language like Verilog, SystemVerilog, or VHDL. Using digital design components like adders, shifters, and state machines {{as well as}} computer architecture concepts like pipelining, superscalar execution, and branch prediction, RTL designers will break a functional description into hardware models of components on the chip working together. Each of the simple statements described in the system design can easily turn into thousands of lines of RTL code, {{which is why it}} is extremely difficult to verify that the RTL will do the right thing in all the possible cases that the user may throw at it.|$|E

25|$|Orthogonality is <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>design</b> {{property}} which {{guarantees that}} modifying the technical effect {{produced by a}} component of a system neither creates nor propagates side effects to other components of the system. Typically this is achieved through the separation of concerns and encapsulation, and {{it is essential for}} feasible and compact designs of complex systems. The emergent behavior of a system consisting of components should be controlled strictly by formal definitions of its logic and not by side effects resulting from poor integration, i.e., non-orthogonal design of modules and interfaces. Orthogonality reduces testing and development time because it is easier to verify designs that neither cause side effects nor depend on them.|$|E
25|$|Various {{manufacturers}} {{use different}} driver mounting arrangements {{to create a}} specific type of sound field in the space for which they are designed. The resulting radiation patterns may be intended to more closely simulate the way sound is produced by real instruments, or simply create a controlled energy distribution from the input signal (some using this approach are called monitors, as they are useful in checking the signal just recorded in a studio). An example of the first is a room corner system with many small drivers on the surface of a 1/8 sphere. <b>A</b> <b>system</b> <b>design</b> of this type was patented and produced commercially by Professor Amar Bose—the 2201. Later Bose models have deliberately emphasized production of both direct and reflected sound by the loudspeaker itself, regardless of its environment. The designs are controversial in high fidelity circles, but have proven commercially successful. Several other manufacturers' designs follow similar principles.|$|E

Specifically, we take visual inter-object scenario-based and intra-object state-based models (sequence charts and statecharts) used for <b>a</b> <b>system’s</b> <b>design,</b> and follow their activation and progress {{as they come}} to life at runtime, during the <b>system’s</b> execution. Thus, <b>a</b> <b>system’s</b> runtime is recorded and viewed through abstractions provided by behavioral models used for its design. We present two example applications related to the automatic generation and visual exploration of model-based traces and suggest a list of related challenges. ...|$|R
