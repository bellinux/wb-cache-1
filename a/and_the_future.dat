5|$|The {{empirical}} {{rejection of}} the unbiasedness hypothesis is a well-recognized puzzle among finance researchers. Empirical evidence for cointegration between the forward rate <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> spot rate is mixed. Researchers have published papers demonstrating empirical failure of the hypothesis by conducting regression analyses of the realized changes in spot exchange rates on forward premiums and finding negative slope coefficients. These researchers offer numerous rationales for such failure. One rationale centers around the relaxation of risk neutrality, while still assuming rational expectations, such that a foreign exchange risk premium may exist that can account for differences between the forward rate <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> spot rate.|$|E

5|$|After the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948 Haifa {{became the}} gateway for Jewish {{immigration}} into Israel. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the neighborhoods of Haifa were sometimes contested. After the war, Jewish immigrants were settled in new neighborhoods, among them Kiryat Hayim, Ramot Remez, Ramat Shaul, Kiryat Sprinzak, and Kiryat Eliezer. Bnei Zion Hospital (formerly Rothschild Hospital) and the Central Synagogue in Hadar Hacarmel date from this period. In 1953, {{a master plan}} was created for transportation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> architectural layout. In 1959, a group of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews, mostly Moroccan Jews, rioted in Wadi Salib, claiming the state was discriminating against them.

5|$|By 1153, {{the castle}} {{garrison}} was running very low on food, and Roger {{made a deal}} with Stephen allowing him to leave the castle with his followers. Henry, the Empress' son <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> Henry II, then intervened, marching his forces to relieve the castle and placing Stephen's counter-castles under siege himself. King Stephen marched back from Oxford, and the two forces confronted each other on the meadows outside the castle. The result was an embryonic peace deal called the Treaty of Wallingford, leading on to the permanent Treaty of Winchester that would ultimately {{bring an end to the}} civil war and install Henry as king following Stephen's death in 1153. Brien, who had no children, chose to enter a monastery, and surrendered Wallingford Castle to Henry at the end of the conflict in 1153.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} he was 6 years old, Domitian's mother and sister had long since died, while his father and brother were {{continuously}} active in the Roman military, commanding armies in Germania and Judaea. For Domitian, this meant that a significant part of his adolescence was spent in the absence of his near relatives.

5|$|By {{the time}} the Germans invaded Belgium in May 1940, there were still 40 tonnes of gold left in Belgium, held at the bank's offices in the port of Ostend. The only ship {{available}} in the area was A4, commanded by Lieutenant Van Vaerenbergh. On 19 May 1940, the vessel was loaded with the gold and, avoiding Dunkirk which was being bombed by the Luftwaffe, headed for the British coast, accompanied by the ship P16 which was carrying refugees. After being transferred from port to port because of concerns {{for the safety of}} the cargo during unloading, the gold was landed at Plymouth on 26 May, two days before the Belgian surrender. The gold was finally deposited at the Bank of England. A4 also carried Hubert Ansiaux, the civil servant charged with overseeing the evacuation of the gold to England <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> Governor of the National Bank.|$|E

William Clito, who was King Louis's preferred choice, remained opposed to Henry and was therefore unsuitable.
