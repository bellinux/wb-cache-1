40|$|The {{response}} of shear stress to a weak ac electric field as a probe {{is measured in}} a nematic liquid crystal under shear flow and dc electric fields. Two states with different responses are clearly observed when the dc electric field is changed at a constant shear rate: the flow <b>aligning</b> and non-flow <b>aligning</b> states. The director lies in the shear plane in the flow <b>aligning</b> state {{and out of the}} plane in the non-flow <b>aligning</b> state. Through application of dc electric field, the non-flow <b>aligning</b> state can be changed to the flow <b>aligning</b> state. In the transition from the flow <b>aligning</b> state to the non-flow <b>aligning</b> state, it is found that the response increases and the relaxation time becomes longer.

40|$|Available online 23 March 2015 [Background]Kinematically <b>aligned</b> total knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA) is {{of increasing}} interest because this method might improve postoperative patient satisfaction. In kinematic alignment the femoral component is implanted {{in a slightly}} more valgus and internally rotated position, and the tibial component is implanted in a slightly more varus and internally rotated position, than in mechanical alignment. However, the biomechanics of kinematically <b>aligned</b> TKA remain largely unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the kinematics and contact stresses of mechanically and kinematically <b>aligned</b> TKAs. [Methods]A musculoskeletal computer simulation was used to determine the effects of mechanically or kinematically <b>aligned</b> TKA. Knee kinematics were examined for mechanically <b>aligned,</b> kinematically <b>aligned,</b> and kinematically <b>aligned</b> outlier models. Patellofemoral and tibiofemoral contact forces were measured using finite element analysis. [Results]Greater femoral rollback and more external rotation of the femoral component were observed with kinematically <b>aligned</b> TKA than mechanically <b>aligned</b> TKA. However, patellofemoral and tibiofemoral contact stresses were increased in kinematically <b>aligned</b> TKA. [Conclusions]These findings suggest that kinematically <b>aligned</b> TKA produces near-normal knee kinematics, but that concerns for long-term outcome might arise because of high contact stresse...|$|R
