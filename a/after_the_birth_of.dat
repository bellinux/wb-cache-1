Though Post offered him financial interest in La Vita Inn and his prospective famous breakfast drink, Postum, provided Beilhart he would stay and work at the Inn. Outraged at his friend's betrayal, Beilhart ordered Post {{out of his house}} and left Battle Creek for Ohio. Louema left Jacob and took the children back to her family in Kansas in 1897. This experience undoubtedly had a profound effect upon Beilhart's view of marriage.|$|E

In 1939, he returned to cricket journalism and according to Christopher Douglas, achieved his highest standard as a writer.|$|E
50|$|They {{disappeared}} from Queensland after World War Two, but {{the nurses and}} midwives who ran them were once an indispensable {{group of people who}} looked <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>births</b> <b>of</b> most Queenslanders. Of the hospitals which have survived, few are still identified in the public mind as such. Herries' Hospital is still strongly associated with the midwives and nurses who were so important for the health and well being of Queensland's mothers.|$|R
50|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>births</b> <b>of</b> {{two daughters}} over a 15-month period, Dick and Mel chose {{to return home}} from touring.

5|$|Although the {{marriage}} had been strained from the beginning, Teresa Cristina continued striving to {{be a good}} wife. Her constancy toward fulfilling her duty, along with the birth of children, softened PedroII's attitude. The two discovered shared interests, and their concern for and delight in their children created a sense of family happiness. That they were sexually active and compatible is witnessed by the series of pregnancies which ensued. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> their first son in February 1845, the Empress bore children in July 1846, July 1847, and July 1848—named Afonso, Isabel, Leopoldina and Pedro, respectively.|$|E
5|$|As {{a tribute}} to his then-pregnant wife, Ilary Blasi, Totti imitated a {{childbirth}} scene by stuffing the ball under his shirt and {{lying on his back}} while his teammates extracted the ball. His current ritual of sucking his thumb after a goal began after his son was born and continued <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> his daughter. Blasi has revealed that Totti also sucks his thumb in dedication to her and not just for their children. On 11 January 2015, Totti scored twice against Lazio in the Derby della Capitale as Roma came back from 2–0 down; he then took a selfie with Roma fans.|$|E

Harriet Jacobs was re-hired by Willis to work for the family.|$|E
5000|$|The {{structure}} of US justice systems makes development of maternal attachment nearly impossible. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>births</b> <b>of</b> their children, {{many women are}} returned to the jail or prison, and their infant immediately enters foster or kinship care. [...] However, within many state policies, relatives are given less financial support, which can leave foster care to be more viable than kinship placement. [...] "For 50% of all incarcerated mothers, this separation becomes a lifelong sentence of permanent separation between mothers and their children." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>births</b> <b>of</b> {{their first}} two sons, Lowell Page Fillmore and Waldo Rickert Fillmore, {{the family moved to}} Kansas City, Missouri.

Myrtle subsequently recovered from chronic tuberculosis and attributed her recovery to her use of prayer and other methods learned in Weeks's classes. Subsequently Charles began to heal from his childhood accident, a development which he too attributed to following this philosophy. Charles Fillmore became a devoted student of philosophy and religion.|$|R

Seven days after being notified of the proposed adoption by the Capobiancos, Brown obtained a stay of the adoption proceedings under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and he deployed with his Army unit to Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny {{descended from}} tribal chiefs through his mother, Kimou N'Drive (also known as N'Dri Kan). She died much later in 1936.

Houphouët-Boigny had two elder sisters, Faitai (1898?–1998) and Adjoua (d. 1987), as well as a younger brother Augustin (d. 1939).|$|E
25|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>births</b> <b>of</b> their children, Victoria Eugenie's {{relationship}} with Alfonso deteriorated, {{and he had}} numerous affairs. It {{has been said that}} he had a dalliance with the Queen's cousin, Beatrice, Duchess of Galliera, but this is disputed. There is some evidence that Alfonso tried to seduce Beatrice, but she didn't give in. The king, in anger, expelled her and her husband from Spain. Then members of the king's circle spread rumours that Beatrice had been expelled because of her bad behaviour, which was not true. All this situation was very painful for the Queen, who could do nothing to help her cousin.|$|R
50|$|In {{the third}} canto of the poem, a burnt cross {{is used to}} summon Clan Alpine to rise against King James. This method of {{rallying}} supporters and publicizing their attacks was adapted by the second Ku Klux Klan in 1915 <b>after</b> <b>the</b> film, <b>The</b> <b>Birth</b> <b>of</b> a Nation. <b>The</b> Ku Klux Klan used cross burning for dramatic terror as a racist tactic.|$|R
40|$|Maternal care is obligate in mammals {{to ensure}} {{offspring}} survivability; however levels of investment are flexible dependent on resource availability. Parental investment theory predicts a mother should cease investing {{in an individual}} offspring when {{the benefits of the}} investment to her inclusive fitness are outweighed by the costs. The Trivers-Willard hypothesis predicts that a son of high quality will out-reproduce a daughter of comparable quality, while a daughter will have higher reproductive success than a son if both are of low quality. Postnatal depression is suggested by some evolutionary theorists to reflect active withdrawal of maternal investment in humans under conditions where continued investment is too costly. If this is the case then it should be expected to 1) conform to Trivers-Willard predictions and be both more common in association with sons than daughters, and 2) be more common in circumstances in which investment in sons is more costly. We test these hypotheses using data collected from a survey of women's complete reproductive histories which utilised retrospective measures of postnatal depression. Multilevel modelling showed that women were more likely to suffer postnatal depression <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>births</b> <b>of</b> sons than <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>births</b> <b>of</b> daughters, when controlling for other postnatal depression risk factors. Having sons was also found to elevate postnatal depression risk when mothers experienced low social support or complicated births. This is a novel and important finding of which healthcare professionals should be made aware...|$|R
5|$|In public, Alexandra was dignified and charming; in private, affectionate and jolly. She enjoyed {{many social}} activities, {{including}} dancing and ice-skating, {{and was an}} expert horsewoman and tandem driver. She also enjoyed hunting, {{to the dismay of}} Queen Victoria, who asked her to stop, but without success. Even <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> her first child, she continued to socialise much as before, which led to some friction between the queen and the young couple, exacerbated by Alexandra's loathing of Prussians and the queen's partiality towards them.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{professional}} obligations <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> {{his first}} son in 1987 {{coincided with a}} reduction in his literary output. During the 1990s he instead focused his attention on his novel Feuers Geraun. Two early versions of this novel's chapters were published by the Upper Austrian magazine die Rampe in 1994 (Der Schreiber von Aram) and 1997 (Das Gesetz). These chapters deal with Jewish and biblical traditions. The publishing list on Ebner's website lists only six publications in anthologies by 2004, but seventeen are listed from between 2005 and 2008.|$|E
5|$|Joe {{received}} little formal schooling. Due to the transient lifestyle of coal miners, {{his family moved}} frequently during his childhood. The McGinnitys moved to Gallatin County in 1878.

40|$|Extensive {{population}} surveys {{begun in}} Italy in 1943 revealed a {{high incidence of}} mycrocytemia. Health authorities established a national organization to combat microcytemia which financed and directed activities throughout Italy from 1955 to 1971. The work performed by the microcytemia centers in screening and prophylaxis is described. The results of a screening program underway since 1967 involving 46, 559 students of the University of Rome are presented in detail. A preliminary survey of 256 families revealed that <b>the</b> incidence <b>of</b> subsequent <b>births</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>births</b> <b>of</b> a child affected by Cooley's anemia was generally low. Results obtained to date are encouraging and justify more extensive programs for the prevention and treatment of microcytemia...|$|R
