New plans from NSB criticized {{the mix of}} rack and <b>adhesion</b> railway, and instead proposed a conventional <b>adhesion</b> line all the way. Engineer Ferdinand Bjerke traveled to Continental Europe to study several combined railways. He published a preliminary report in 1911, which recommended an <b>adhesion</b> railway, although he also felt {{the need for a}} detailed study of a rack railway. His final report was finished in 1913, and although it recommended <b>adhesion,</b> it pointed out that the line's capacity would be smaller than predicted and that costs would be three times as high—NOK5.5 million. The plans were approved by the Ministry of Labour and NSB's main board in 1915.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental model of peritoneal <b>adhesions,</b> in the rat, {{based on two}} relatively minor accidents that may occur during abdominal surgery in man: drying of the serosa, and bleeding. Drying alone had little effect; drying plus bleeding consistently produced <b>adhesions</b> to the dried area. Fresh blood alone produced <b>adhesions</b> between the three membranous structures [omentum and pelvic fat bodies (PFBs) ]. The formation of persistent <b>adhesions</b> required whole blood. Preformed clots above a critical size induced <b>adhesions</b> even without previous serosal injury; they were usually captured by the omentum and PFBs. If all three membranous structures were excised, the clots caused visceral <b>adhesions.</b> The protective role of the omentum, its structure, and the mechanism of omental <b>adhesions,</b> are discussed.

More importantly, <b>adhesions</b> are so variable in severity following previous surgery that it becomes difficult to distinguish between surgery-related and endometriosis-related <b>adhesions.</b> Finally, the occurrence of cystic ovarian endometriosis without <b>adhesions</b> is so rare that, anyway, a statistical evaluation of this potentially different group will be practically impossible by lack of numbers.|$|R

25|$|A {{classical}} hunting oscillation is a swaying {{motion of}} a railway vehicle (often called truck hunting) {{caused by the}} coning action on which the directional stability of an <b>adhesion</b> railway depends. It arises from the interaction of <b>adhesion</b> forces and inertial forces. At low speed, <b>adhesion</b> dominates but, as the speed increases, the <b>adhesion</b> forces and inertial forces become comparable in magnitude and the oscillation begins at a critical speed. Above this speed, the motion can be violent, damaging track and wheels and potentially causing derailment. The problem does not occur on systems with a differential because the action depends on both wheels of a wheelset rotating at the same angular rate, although differentials tend to be rare, and conventional trains have their wheels fixed to the axles in pairs instead.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, {{inflammatory}} responses {{within the}} bone marrow are believed to foster many hematological diseases. The secretion of IL-6 by bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) and the secretion of the <b>adhesion</b> molecules VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and LFA, is induced {{in the presence of}} TNF-α and the <b>adhesion</b> of MM cells to BMSC. In vitro proliferation of MM cell lines and inhibition of Fas-mediated apoptosis is promoted by IL-6. Thalidomide and its analogs directly decrease the up-regulation of IL-6 and indirectly through TNF-α, thereby reducing the secretion of <b>adhesion</b> molecules leading to fewer MM cells adhering to BMSC. Osteoclasts become highly active during MM, leading to bone resorption and secretion of various MM survival factors. They decrease the levels of <b>adhesion</b> molecules paramount to osteoclast activation, decrease the formation of the cells that form osteoclasts and downregulate cathepsin K, an important cysteine protease expressed in osteoclasts.|$|E

40|$|Fibronectin matrix {{formation}} {{requires the}} increased cytoskeletal tension generated by cadherin <b>adhesions,</b> and is suppressed by membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT 1 -MMP). In a co-culture of Rat 1 fibroblasts and MT 1 -MMP-silenced HT 1080 cells, fibronectin fibrils extended from Rat 1 to cell-matrix <b>adhesions</b> in HT 1080 cells, and N-cadherin <b>adhesions</b> were formed between Rat 1 and HT 1080 cells. In control HT 1080 cells contacting with Rat 1 fibroblasts, cell-matrix <b>adhesions</b> were {{formed in the}} side away from Rat 1 fibroblasts, and fibronectin assembly and N-cadherin <b>adhesions</b> were not formed. The role of N-cadherin <b>adhesions</b> in fibronectin matrix formation was studied using MT 1 -MMP-silenced HT 1080 cells. MT 1 -MMP knockdown promoted fibronectin matrix assembly and N-cadherin <b>adhesions</b> in HT 1080 cells, which was abrogated by double knockdown with either integrin β 1 or fibronectin. Conversely, inhibition of N-cadherin <b>adhesions</b> by its knockdown or treatment with its neutralizing antibody suppressed fibronectin matrix formation in MT 1 -MMP-silenced cells. These results demonstrate that fibronectin assembly initiated by MT 1 -MMP knockdown results in increase of N-cadherin <b>adhesions,</b> which are prerequisite for further fibronectin matrix formation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The global {{increase}} in Cesarean section rate {{is associated with}} short- and long-term complications, including <b>adhesions</b> with potential serious maternal and fetal consequences. This study investigated the prevalence of <b>adhesions</b> and association between <b>adhesions</b> and postoperative complications in a tertiary referral hospital in Accra, Ghana. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 335 women scheduled for cesarean section at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Ghana were included from June to December 2015. Presence or absence of <b>adhesions</b> was recorded and {{the severity of the}} <b>adhesions</b> was scored using a classification system. Associations between presence and severity of <b>adhesions,</b> postoperative complications, and maternal and infant outcomes at discharge and 6 weeks postpartum were assessed using multivariate logistic and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Of the participating women, 128 (38 %) had <b>adhesions</b> and 207 (62 %) did not. Prevalence of <b>adhesions</b> increased with history of caesarean section; 2. 8 % with no CS but may have had an abdominal surgery, 51 % with one previous CS, 62 % with > 1 CS). <b>Adhesions</b> significantly increased operation time (mean 39. 2 (± 15. 1) minutes, absolute adjusted difference with presence of <b>adhesions</b> 9. 6 min, 95 %CI 6. 4 - 12. 8), infant delivery time (mean 5. 4 (± 4. 8) minutes, adjusted difference 2. 4 min, 95 %CI 1. 3 - 3. 4), and blood loss for women with severe <b>adhesions</b> (mean blood loss 418. 8 ml (± 140. 6), adjusted difference 57. 6 ml (95 %CI 12. 1 - 103. 0). No differences for other outcomes were observed. CONCLUSION: With cesarean section rates rising globally, intra-abdominal <b>adhesions</b> occur more frequently. Risks of <b>adhesions</b> and associated complications should be considered in counseling patients for cesarean section...|$|R
