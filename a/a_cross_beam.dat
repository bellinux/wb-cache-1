The other corners had clasping pilasters behind which were the urinals. This wide mill designed using Stott 1871 patent for fireproof construction.

40|$|Predicting future {{condition}} {{and reliability of}} the deteriorating structures is vital for their effective management. Probabilistic models {{have been developed to}} estimate and predict the extent of deterioration in concrete structures but their input parameters are fraught with uncertainties, hence limiting the effective use of the models for long term predictions. On the other hand, continuous innovations in the sensing and measurement technology have {{led to the development of}} monitoring instruments that can provide continuous (or almost continuous) real time information regarding structural performance. Thus, powerful decision support tools may be developed by combining information obtained through structural health monitoring with probabilistic performance prediction models. The potential benefits of improving performance prediction using health monitoring systems and their implications on the management of deterioration prone structures are presented in this paper. A typical structural element of a bridge (e. g. slab, beam or <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>beam</b> etc) subjected to chloride induced deterioration is considered. It is shown that the confidence inpredicted performance can be improved considerably through the use of health monitoring methods and hence, the management activities such as inspections, repair and maintenance etc can be adjusted whilst keeping consistent target performance levels. A comparison of various probabilistic models for the input parameters (e. g. exposure conditions, threshold chloride concentration etc) indicates that the effects of uncertainty can be minimised through the in service health monitoring systems...|$|E
40|$|New {{challenges}} for design, manufacturing and packaging of MEMS/NEMS {{arise from the}} ongoing miniaturization process. Therefore there is a demand on detailed information on thermo-mechanical material properties of the applied materials. Because of size effects and the strong dependency of the thermo-mechanical behavior of active and passive components on process parameters often unsolved questions of residual stresses lead to system failure due to crack formation. With the fibDAC (Focused Ion Beam based Deformation Analysis by Correlation) method which is {{presented in this paper}} the classical hole drilling method for stress release measurement has been downscaled to the nanoscale. The ion beam of the FIB station is used as a milling tool which causes the stress release at silicon microstructures of MEMS devices. The analysis of the stress release is achieved by digital image correlation (DIC) applied to load state SEM images captured in <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>beam</b> equipment (combination of SEM and FIB). The results of the DIC analysis are deformation fields which are transferred to stress solution by application of finite element analysis. In another step the resolution of the method has been improved by the application of trench milling instead of hole milling. Thereby deformation measurements in the nm range are established. The method is also a powerful tool for the analysis of sub-grain stresses of engineering materials...|$|E

The work has been carried out by Hannah Jordansson, a student at the Faculty of Health, Nature and Technology science. The main task of the project was to develop a calculation program in Excel for industrial conveyors for the company ÅF Industry.
