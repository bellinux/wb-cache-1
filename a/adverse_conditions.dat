5|$|Although {{survival}} in undisturbed sites is high, at 80–90%, the corn crake suffers from modern farming practices, since mechanised mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks {{in a given}} site. The influence of weather on corn crake chick survival is limited: although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother {{for a few days}} until they become independent, and this may cushion them from <b>adverse</b> <b>conditions.</b> The number of live chicks hatched {{is more important than the}} weather, with lower {{survival in}} large broods.|$|E

5|$|For Kant a {{good will}} is a broader {{conception}} than a will which acts from duty. A will which acts from duty is distinguishable as a will which overcomes hindrances {{in order to}} keep the moral law. A dutiful will is thus a special case of a good will which becomes visible in <b>adverse</b> <b>conditions.</b> Kant argues that only acts performed with regard to duty have moral worth. This is not to say that acts performed merely in accordance with duty are worthless (these still deserve approval and encouragement), but that special esteem is given to acts which are performed out of duty.|$|E
5|$|Lacking firm {{movement}} {{because of}} weak steering currents, Gordon meandered north-northeast {{in the presence}} of mild west-southwesterly wind shear, unable to strengthen under the <b>adverse</b> <b>conditions.</b> By November 11, a trough prodded Gordon to the north-northeast at 8mph (13km/h), and it strengthened by 6mph (9km/h) as it moved through the central Caribbean Sea. The trough continued steering Gordon, bending it eastward towards Jamaica on the afternoon on November 12. Despite the warm waters, Gordon did not strengthen that day as strong upper-tropospheric shear hindered development, disorganized the upper level circulation, and reduced its winds to 40mph (65km/h).|$|E
5|$|Like the sassabies, {{hartebeest}} produce quiet quacking and grunting sounds. Juveniles {{tend to be}} {{more vocal}} than adults, and produce a quacking call when alarmed or pursued. The hartebeest uses defecation as an olfactory and visual display. Herds are generally sedentary, and tend to migrate only under <b>adverse</b> <b>conditions</b> such as natural calamities. The hartebeest is the least migratory in the tribe Alcelaphini (which also includes wildebeest and sassabies), and also consumes the least amount of water and has the lowest metabolic rate among the members of the tribe.|$|E

5|$|Outside of Nova Scotia, {{the winds}} from Carol were {{strong enough to}} knock down trees and power lines in New Brunswick. Light rainfall, peaking at 2.44inches (62mm) in the province, caused street {{flooding}} in Moncton. The rainfall reached as far west as Ontario, and as far east as Prince Edward Island, where rainfall reached 1.73inches (44mm). Winds in the latter province damaged roofs and downed some trees, resulting in minor power outages. Further north in Quebec, <b>adverse</b> <b>conditions</b> from the storm delayed a search party after a plane crash.|$|E
5|$|Parental care {{is found}} in a few species of beetle, perhaps for {{protection}} against <b>adverse</b> <b>conditions</b> and predators. The rove beetle Bledius spectabilis lives in salt marshes, so the eggs and larvae are endangered by the rising tide. The maternal beetle patrols the eggs and larvae, burrowing {{to keep them from}} flooding and asphyxiating, and protects them from the predatory carabid beetle Dicheirotrichus gustavi and from the parasitoidal wasp Barycnemis blediator, which kills some 15% of the larvae.|$|E

Despite the exceptionally <b>adverse</b> <b>conditions</b> faced by the keepers, which resulted in them receiving additional payments in kind, Ewing {{was not the only}} one who served the light for a decade or more. However, some found the lonely rock and its cramped quarters less to their taste. One had to be prevented from diving into the sea and attempting to swim ashore.|$|E

5|$|A primary {{function}} of the FMPU was the training of combat cameramen. The units were based at nearby Page Military Academy. There were approximately 16 combat units, each made up of seven officers and between 20 and 30 enlisted men. They were trained to {{use a variety of}} photographic equipment and cameras and also received combat and weapons training. The cameramen were sent to every army air force base to document all aspects of the base's operations as well as aerial battle tactics and enemy airplane performance. Every cameraman was trained to load film into their camera under <b>adverse</b> <b>conditions,</b> and if need be, to develop it on location. Most of the aerial motion picture photography shot during World War II was filmed by Fort Roach alumni.|$|E

The band members considered him to be an unattainable candidate as a producer, but he responded favourably. Upon learning that {{he was interested in}} working with them, they moved to London. At the time, Nelson was occupied working with Coldplay. For eight to ten months, the band lived in <b>adverse</b> <b>conditions</b> in one room in a house in London. During this period, the members took up menial employment opportunities. Picchio sold double-glazing over the telephone. Moule worked in a pub and in a car workshop, and Joel worked on a farm.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began at}} the National Museum Cardiff, which doubled for the history museum {{depicted}} in the episode's first scene. To portray the tunnel the bus travelled into, the Queen's Gate Tunnel of the A4232 road in Butetown was closed for four nights to accommodate filming. The last major piece of filming in Wales {{took place in the}} closed Mir (formerly Alphasteel) steelworks in Newport, which doubled almost unaltered for the Tritovore spaceship. Scenes set in London's Oxford Street were filmed at St Mary Street, Cardiff. Filming took place {{at the peak of the}} February 2009 Great Britain snowfall, where the sub-zero temperatures slowed filming and had a visible effect on the cast. To accommodate for the <b>adverse</b> <b>conditions,</b> Davies included a line in the script that specified that the Tritovore spaceship cooled as external temperatures increase.|$|E

The results reveal that workers currently facing <b>adverse</b> working <b>conditions</b> have greater intentions to switch jobs and they are also more willing to stop working completely. In addition, those workers search new matches more frequently. There is evidence that <b>adverse</b> working <b>conditions</b> consistently increase the level of job dissatisfaction and, in turn, it is job dissatisfaction that drives workers’ intentions to quit and intensifies actual job search. working conditions, job satisfaction, on-the-job search, quit intentions...|$|R
5|$|Given an {{adequate}} supply of food, larvae pupate and weave silken cocoons after three larval stages. Within the cocoon, the larva moults {{for a final}} time and undergoes metamorphosis into the adult form. This can take just four days, but may take much longer under <b>adverse</b> <b>conditions,</b> and there follows a variable-length stage during which the pre-emergent adult awaits a suitable opportunity to emerge. Trigger factors for emergence include vibrations (including sound), heat (in warm-blooded hosts), and increased levels of carbon dioxide, all of which stimuli may indicate {{the presence of a}} suitable host. Large numbers of pre-emergent fleas may be present in otherwise flea-free environments, and the introduction of a suitable host may trigger a mass emergence.|$|E
5|$|In December 1987, the Conservancy {{performed}} one of {{its first}} breed rescues when it removed a viable population of Santa Cruz sheep from Santa Cruz Island. The sheep {{were in danger of}} being eradicated by The Nature Conservancy, which was working to save indigenous vegetation that the breed used as food. The first twelve lambs were removed from the island in 1988, with further animals brought to the mainland in 1991. The population now stands at 125 animals and is considered an important genetic resource due to its island heritage, which kept it isolated from other breeds and forced it to adapt to <b>adverse</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E
5|$|Las Casas {{worked there}} in <b>adverse</b> <b>conditions</b> for the {{following}} months, being constantly harassed by the Spanish pearl fishers of Cubagua island who traded slaves for alcohol with the natives. Early in 1522 Las Casas left the settlement to complain to the authorities. While he was gone the native Caribs attacked the settlement of Cumaná, burned {{it to the ground}} and killed four of Las Casas's men. He returned to Hispaniola in January 1522, and heard the news of the massacre. The rumours even included him among the dead. To make matters worse, his detractors used the event as evidence of the need to pacify the Indians using military means. The tragic outcome of Las Casas's great mainland adventure made him turn his life in a new direction.|$|E

The potential influence of <b>adverse</b> working <b>conditions</b> on self-reported fairness of pay at the workplace is considered as an alternative, indirect measure of job satisfaction. The results show that working conditions have a very minor role in the determination of individual wages in the Finnish labour market.

5|$|Late in its duration, Gert passed just {{southeast}} of Newfoundland before becoming extratropical, producing wave heights of 77.4ft (23.6m) offshore and 30ft (9m) onshore. In St. Bride's along the Avalon Peninsula, a large wave severely damaged a wharf, destroying five boats and damaging 45 others. Along the wharf, a wave swept three {{people into the}} ocean, hospitalizing one of them. The wharf required $2million (1999CAD, $1.9million 1999USD) in repairs, forcing its closure. Further west, high waves damaged a fish plant in Lord's Cove. Gale-force winds extended across southeastern Newfoundland, and in the Grand Banks a station reported winds of 74mph (120km/h). Onshore, the winds downed trees and caused power outages, primarily in the St. John's area. In addition, the <b>adverse</b> <b>conditions</b> from Gert prompted the cancellation of flights to and from St. John's International Airport.|$|E
5|$|Nest {{success in}} {{undisturbed}} sites is high, at 80–90%, but much lower in fertilised meadows and on arable land. The method {{and timing of}} mowing is crucial; mechanized mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks in a given site, and losses average 50% of first brood chicks and somewhat less than 40% of second brood chicks. The influence of weather on chick survival is limited; although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother {{to a greater or}} lesser extent until they become independent, and this may cushion them from <b>adverse</b> <b>conditions.</b> The number of live chicks hatched is more important than the weather, with lower survival in large broods. The annual adult survival rate is under 30%, although some individuals may live for 5–7 years.|$|E
5|$|Taxable, Glimmer and Big Drum were {{complicated}} in execution, requiring {{coordination of}} air and naval forces. Launched in poor weather conditions, Taxable {{did not appear to}} have the desired effect and failed to elicit any significant response from the Germans. The reaction to Glimmer was more encouraging. The attacks on the bomber squadrons indicated, at least to the satisfaction of RAF Bomber Command, that the Germans believed a genuine threat existed. There is no evidence that Big Drum elicited any specific response from the shore. According to historian Mary Barbier, the <b>adverse</b> <b>conditions</b> and complexity of the operations contributed to the limited enemy response.|$|E
