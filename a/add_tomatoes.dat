Many recipes <b>add</b> <b>tomatoes</b> or canned tomato sauce, while others add beef broth and/or brandy or other distilled spirits. In some older recipes {{the addition of a}} calf's foot or soup bones would add gelatin to the braising liquid, which serves to thicken the resulting sauce.|$|E

5000|$|Although not a {{universal}} mutation, many western {{interpretations of the}} dish <b>add</b> <b>tomatoes</b> to the sauce, thinning it slightly, enriching the flavour and deepening the red colour. This is especially common with ready made pour-over cooking sauces, {{such as those of}} the Patak brand, {{to the point where the}} dish may be considered tomato-based. This variation may instead have a similar origin to Tikka masala. Alternatively, this variation may instead be based on the Kashmiri practice of always cooking meat and tomatoes together whenever both are available, a mixture which may then have been used with the other ingredients to create a [...] "Tomatomeat" [...] Rogan Josh whose identity was then simplified in transit. The origin may also simply be a case of corner cutting, using relatively cheaper ingredients such as processed tomatoes, which wouldn't be as easily noticed in a hot, red sauce, to bulk out an otherwise more expensive dish of lamb, spices and aromatic chilis.|$|E
5000|$|Peel, {{wash and}} prick baby {{potatoes}} {{all over with}} the help of a fork. In some recipes the potatoes are kept unpeeled. In this case they should be washed properly.

50|$|There {{are many}} famous pizzerias in Naples where these {{traditional}} pizzas {{can be found}} such as Da Michele, Port'Alba, Brandi, Di Matteo, Sorbillo, Trianon, and Umberto (founded: 1916).

2500|$|Tomatoes {{are another}} {{ingredient}} on which opinions differ. Wick Fowler, north Texas newspaperman and inventor of [...] "Two-Alarm Chili" [...] (which he later marketed as a [...] "kit" [...] of spices), insisted on <b>adding</b> <b>tomato</b> sauce to his chili— one 15-oz. can per three pounds of meat.

50|$|The {{innovation}} {{that led to}} flat bread pizza {{was the use of}} tomato as a topping. For some time after the tomato was brought to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century, it was believed by many Europeans to be poisonous (as some other fruits of the nightshade family are). However, by the late 18th century, it was common for the poor of the area around Naples to <b>add</b> <b>tomato</b> to their yeast-based flat bread, and so the pizza began. The dish gained popularity, and soon pizza became a tourist attraction as visitors to Naples ventured into the poorer areas of the city to try the local specialty.|$|R

50|$|In West Bengal, and {{especially}} Kolkata, egg roll {{refers to a}} fried egg wrapped inside a paratha fried flat-bread. After the paratha has been prepared, an egg is cracked on a pan and while the egg is still uncooked, the paratha is added. It is cooked until the egg is well done and is stuck to the paratha. After that, the contents are removed from the pan and sliced raw onions, sliced green chilis, sliced cucumbers, a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, and black salt is added. An optional choice is <b>adding</b> <b>tomato</b> ketchup at the end. It is wrapped in paper {{and served as a}} take away street food. This delicacy was specially invented for the Colonial Britishers living in the then Calcutta as a quick snack.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This study {{includes}} {{the investigation of}} the chemical properties such as pH value and a*-value, sensorial evaluations, residual nitrite and the oxidation level of Chinese-style sausage—red sausage, which have been produced by both reducing the nitrite level (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg) and <b>adding</b> <b>tomato</b> powder (0 %, 2 % and 4 %). According to the results, 100 mg/kg of nitrite together with 2 % tomato powder is better. Then the sausages produced with 100 mg/kg nitrite and 2 % tomato powder, along with sausage which produced with only 150 mg/kg of nitrite are stored at 4 °C for 45 days. It was observed that addition of 2 % of tomato powder increased degradation of nitrite and decreased the level of oxidation. This study provides a potential solution for nitrite substitute in meat products...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} supplementing the diet of Comisana sheep with by-products from industrial tomato manifacture on the composition and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) content of milk fat, two groups of 50 ewes each were fed either total mixed ration standard (TMRS) or total mixed ration with <b>added</b> <b>tomato</b> by-products (TMRA). Milk fat composition was determinated by HRGC. The milk fat content for animals fed the TMRA diet increased by 6, 41 % aafter six weeks, compared with the animals fed the TMRS diet. The CLA content in the milk fat for the group of animal fed the TMRA diet was 19, 8 % higher than for those fed the TMRS diet. The fatty acid composition showed {{an increase in the}} amount of PUFA; the n- 3 :n- 6 ratio increased by 13 % in the milk from sheep fed with the TMRA diet...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the infl uence of {{lactic acid}} {{fermentation}} {{on the quality of}} tomato powder was evaluated. The eff ect of <b>adding</b> fermented <b>tomato</b> powder to ready-to-cook minced pork meat to improve its nutritional value and sensory characteristics was also analysed. The cell growth of Lactobacillus sakei (7. 53 log CFU/g) was more intense in the medium containing tomato powder, compared to the growth of Pediococcus pentosaceus (6. 35 log CFU/g) during 24 h of fermentation; however, higher acidity (pH= 4. 1) was observed in the tomato powder samples fermented with Pediococcus pentosaceus. The spontaneous fermentation of tomato powder reduced cell growth by 38 % and pH values slightly increased to 4. 17, compared to the fermentation with pure LAB. The lactofermentation of tomato powder increased the average β-carotene and lycopene mass fractions by 43. 9 and 50. 2 %, respectively, compared with the nonfermented samples. Lycopene and β-carotene contents in the ready-to-cook minced pork meat were proportional to the <b>added</b> <b>tomato</b> powder (10 and 30 %). Aft er cooking, β-carotene and lycopene contents decreased, on average, by 24. 2 and 41. 2 %, respectively. The highest loss (up to 49. 2 %) of carotenoids was found in samples with 30 % nonfermented tomato powder. Tomato powder fermented with 10 % Lactobacillus sakei KTU 05 - 6 can be recommended as both a colouring agent and a source of lycopene in the preparation of ready-to-cook minced pork meat...|$|R
30|$|The {{crude protein}} content of chicken {{sausages}} decreased significantly (P[*]<[*] 0.05) with lean meat replacement, however, reduction was not significant (P[*]>[*] 0.05) between the variants prepared by incorporation of 12 and 18 percent levels of pumpkin. At 18 percent level it was significantly (P[*]<[*] 0.05) lower as compared to control. The probable reasons for the decreased protein content {{may be attributed to}} the comparatively lower protein contents of pumpkin pulp. Suradkar et al. (2013) also reported a decrease in the protein content of chicken nuggets containing bread crumbs. Verma et al. (2013) also observed a decrease in the protein content of sheep meat nuggets on incorporation of guava powder. Taludkar and Sharma (2009) observed a decrease in protein content of chicken meat patties incorporated with wheat and oat bran. Similar results were reported by Candogan (2002) for beef patties with <b>added</b> <b>tomato</b> paste and by Anderson and Berry (2001) for high-fat ground beef with added inner pea fibre.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ingredients}} are ground beef, rice, yellow split peas, leeks, mint, parsley, onion, and Persian spices for the dough and boiled egg, walnut, fried onion, and dried apricot for {{the core of}} the Kufteh. Boil rice and split peas separately each for fifteen minutes. Cut one onion in small pieces and fry it in vegetable oil. Mix and cut all of the vegetables into small pieces. Grate another onion in tiny pieces and drain out its juice. Mix all ground beef, ground onion, boiled rice, boiled peas and vegetables with Azerbaijani spices and salt and squish them all. Make a ground ball of the pulp and put the apricot, and boiled egg in the middle. <b>Add</b> <b>tomato</b> paste and barberries to the frying onion and fry for couple of minutes again then pour water inside it and heat it up till it boils. Carefully put the meatballs inside the boiling mix and keep it boiling for half an hour.|$|R
