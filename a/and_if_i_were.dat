25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{imperfections}} in the new South Africa where I would have hoped that things would be better, but on balance I think we have basically achieved what we set out to achieve. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> to draw balance sheets on where South Africa stands now, I would say that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. But the positives – the stability in South Africa, the adherence to well-balanced economic policies, fighting inflation, doing all the right things in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth – are in place.|$|E
500|$|Hamilton's {{policies}} as Secretary of the Treasury greatly affected the United States government and still continue to influence it. His constitutional interpretation, specifically of the Necessary and Proper Clause, set precedents for federal authority {{that are still}} used by the courts and are considered an authority on constitutional interpretation. The prominent French diplomat Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, who spent 1794 in the United States, wrote, [...] "I consider Napoleon, Fox, and Hamilton the three greatest men of our epoch, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> forced to decide between the three, I would give without hesitation {{the first place to}} Hamilton", adding that Hamilton had intuited the problems of European conservatives.|$|E
500|$|In June 1837 Chopin visited London incognito in {{the company}} of the piano {{manufacturer}} Camille Pleyel where he played at a musical soirée at the house of English piano maker James Broadwood. On his return to Paris, his association with Sand began in earnest, {{and by the end of}} June 1838 they had become lovers. Sand, who was six years older than the composer, and who had had a series of lovers, wrote at this time: [...] "I must say I was confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me... I have still not recovered from my astonishment, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> a proud person I should be feeling humiliated at having been carried away..." [...] The two spent a miserable winter on Majorca (8 November 1838 to 13 February 1839), where, together with Sand's two children, they had journeyed in the hope of improving the health of Chopin and that of Sand's 15-year-old son Maurice, and also to escape the threats of Sand's former lover Félicien Mallefille. After discovering that the couple were not married, the deeply traditional Catholic people of Majorca became inhospitable, making accommodation difficult to find. This compelled the group to take lodgings in a former Carthusian monastery in Valldemossa, which gave little shelter from the cold winter weather.|$|E

2500|$|Montaigne died of quinsy {{at the age}} of 59, in 1592 at the Château de Montaigne. The {{disease in}} his case [...] "brought about {{paralysis}} of the tongue", and he had once said [...] "the most fruitful and natural play of the mind is conversation. I find it sweeter than any other action in life; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> forced to choose, I think I would rather lose my sight than my hearing and voice." [...] Remaining in possession of all his other faculties, he requested mass, and died during the celebration of that mass.|$|E
2500|$|Shlomo Ben-Ami, then Israel's Minister of Foreign Relations {{who participated}} in the talks, stated that the Palestinians wanted the {{immediate}} withdrawal of the Israelis from the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, and only subsequently the Palestinian authority would dismantle the Palestinian organizations. The Israeli response was [...] "we can't accept the demand for a return to the borders of June 1967 as a pre-condition for the negotiation." [...] In 2006, Shlomo Ben-Ami stated on Democracy Now! that [...] "Camp David was not the missed opportunity for the Palestinians, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> a Palestinian I would have rejected Camp David, as well. This is something I put in the book. But Taba is the problem. The Clinton parameters are the problem" [...] referring to his 2001 book Scars of War, Wounds of Peace: The Israeli-Arab Tragedy.|$|E
2500|$|Tutu has {{acknowledged}} the significant role Jews {{played in the}} anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa and has voiced support for Israel's security concerns, speaking against suicide bombing. He is an adversary {{of the doctrine of}} Supersessionism, the biblical interpretation that the Christian Church supersedes or replaces Israel in God's plan, and that the New Covenant nullifies the biblical promises made to Israel. He is also an active and prominent proponent of the campaign for divestment from Israel, likening Israel's treatment of Palestinians to the treatment of Black South Africans under apartheid. Tutu drew this comparison on a Christmas visit to Jerusalem in 1989, when he said that he is a [...] "black South African, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> to change the names, a description of what is happening in Gaza and the West Bank could describe events in South Africa." [...] He made similar comments in 2002, speaking of [...] "the humiliation of the Palestinians at checkpoints and roadblocks, suffering like us when young white police officers prevented us from moving about".|$|E

2500|$|Reports of Guzmán's {{treatment}} of the Indigenous had reached Mexico City and Spain, and, at Bishop Zumárraga's request the Crown sent Diego Pérez de la Torre to investigate. Guzmán was arrested in 1536. He was held a prisoner {{for more than a}} year and then sent to Spain in fetters. He was released from the [...] in 1538. In 1539 he returned to his position as royal contino bodyguard - court records show him on the payroll every year from 1539 to 1561 (in 1561 as [...] "deceased"). In 1552 he wrote up a memorial containing his own version of the events leading to his fall. In his account he justified his execution of the Purépecha Cazonci as being necessary in order to bring a Christian rule of law to the area, and he assured that: [...] "in truth no execution more just has been carried out in all of New Spain, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> deserving of any punishment it would be for having doubted some days about whether to carry it out." ...|$|E
2500|$|The duo and {{the rest}} of the show's writing staff then spent three weeks writing {{material}} for the episode, with it being twice the length of a standard episode. The writers did not intentionally tone down their material as they knew that Lucasfilm would inform them of any items unsuitable for broadcast. Lucasfilm's director of marketing Tom Warner noted that [...] "There were definitely a few [...] I batted an eye at, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> producing probably wouldn't have put in. But they were having fun with it." [...] The writers decided not to choose [...] "obvious" [...] things to subvert so, for example, rather than just penning a sketch mocking Jar Jar Binks, had Jar Jar meet up with Darth Vader and react to the changes he has undergone since they last met. Goldstein noted [...] "It was a wild challenge to come up with fresh, new stuff since Star Wars has already been parodied for 30 years now." [...] On the style of the humor, Green opined: [...] "We love to emphasize the mundane in the extraordinary, and Star Wars was perfect for that. You have something that's intergalactic, and yet there's got to be some textural machinations of day-to-day business: How can you run an industry that large without paperwork? And where are the bathrooms?" ...|$|E
