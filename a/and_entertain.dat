5|$|The team's cheerleaders are the Carolina Topcats, a {{group of}} 24 women who lead cheers <b>and</b> <b>entertain</b> fans at home games. The TopCats {{participate}} in both corporate and charity events. The team's drumline is PurrCussion, an ensemble of snare, tenor, and bass drummers as well as cymbal players. PurrCussion performs for fans outside the stadium and introduces players prior to home games; it consists of drummers from across the Carolinas.|$|E
5|$|Fans may wear a full {{or partial}} fursuit or other costume {{to express their}} {{identity}} <b>and</b> <b>entertain</b> others, though typically less than 15% of attendees bring a costume, and few of these wear them all the time. Others may wear accessories such as ears or a tail, particularly outside the main convention area. Nearly all will wear one or more custom convention badges featuring a depiction of their anthropomorphic persona, some with attached ribbons providing an indicator of social status, such as a notice of affiliation, or sponsorship of the convention. Sales of such accessories form {{a part of the}} commerce at furry conventions.|$|E

5|$|In addition, {{visitors}} could {{participate in}} solving chess {{problems at the}} National Flag Square from 1 August to 14 September. At the Baku Boulevard, three giant chess sets were available to the visitors from 10 August to 14 September, while one-metre high painted chess pieces made by 30 professional artists were being displayed from 20 August to 14 September. The Baku Boulevard also hosted Chess Queen dances and performances from 1 to 14 September. The Queen as a chess piece symbolises freedom of movement. The role of the Queens is played by acclaimed artists that performed dances as well as greet <b>and</b> <b>entertain</b> the visitors.|$|E
5|$|Parades {{generally}} impress {{and delight}} (5, 6, 7, 8), often by including unusual, colourful costumes (6, 7). Sometimes they also commemorate (5, 8) or celebrate (1, 4, 8, 9, 10). Sometimes {{they have a}} serious purpose, such as when the context is military (1, 2, 5), when the intention is sometimes to intimidate; or religious, when the audience might participate or {{have a role to}} play (6, 7, 9). Even if a parade uses new technology and is some distance away (10), it is likely to have a strong appeal, draw the attention of onlookers <b>and</b> <b>entertain</b> them.|$|E
5|$|The {{series is}} {{designed}} for a pre-school audience, featuring five performers who educate <b>and</b> <b>entertain</b> through music, movement and play. Music {{is an integral part}} of the series with the band's pop appeal resonating in the program. The segments of the show are based on an educational model. The original cast was composed of Kellie Crawford, Kathleen de Leon Jones, Nathan Foley, Tim Harding and Charli Robinson. This line-up had been completely phased out by the end of 2008 and were replaced with a new line-up of performers. Hi-5 received three Logie Television Awards for Most Outstanding Children's Program.|$|E

5|$|Parades {{are held}} {{for a range}} of purposes, often more than one. Whether their mood is sombre or festive, being public events that are {{designed}} to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic, parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences. Cavalcades and the modern variant, the motorcade, are examples of public processions. Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend, while others become part of the audience by happenstance. Whatever their mood or primary purpose, parades attract <b>and</b> <b>entertain</b> people who watch them pass by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space (such as the Trooping the Colour in 5) and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast.|$|E

25|$|The Society has a cricket team {{which plays}} {{at a number}} of venues each season.

25|$|The {{concept of}} a fixed park for {{amusement}} was further developed {{with the beginning of}} the world's fairs.

25|$|The {{most recent}} {{statistics}} show {{a decrease in}} the population of the city, to 205,934 in the middle of 2009. This is mainly because quite a large number of citizens have been moving to nearby communities, adjacent to the formal administrative area of Toruń, but still outside it. As a result, Toruń is surrounded by a belt of densely populated settlements, whose inhabitants work, shop <b>and</b> <b>entertain</b> in the city proper, but do not officially live there.|$|E

25|$|The series {{revolves}} around {{the daily lives of}} two 23-year-old friends, Mordecai (a blue jay), and Rigby (a raccoon). They work as groundskeepers at a park, and spend their days trying to avoid work <b>and</b> <b>entertain</b> themselves by any means. This is much to the chagrin of their manager/boss Benson (a gumball machine) and their coworker Skips (a yeti), but to the delight of their (other) manager/boss Pops (a man with a lollipop-shaped head). Other coworkers include an overweight green man called Muscle Man, and a ghost called Hi-Five Ghost.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to consider the context in which these terms appear in the stories since, as a writer of fiction, Tolkien's primary purpose is to engage <b>and</b> <b>entertain</b> the reader while not being tied to a set terminology the way a military historian must be. Tolkien sometimes adopts just that historian stance going into great detail about tactical movements, weapons and formations as he does in The Battles of the Fords of Isen, or Cirion and Eorl. He can apply the same attention to detail to the drill of a shield-wall formation as to the intricacies of family relationships of the Sackville-Baggins.|$|E
25|$|The mill did {{not only}} {{serve as a}} {{workplace}} for its employees, it also led {{the development of the}} surrounding land, which was used to house <b>and</b> <b>entertain</b> employees and their families. When textile mills opened in the South in the late 1800s and early 1900s, mill towns sprouted up around the growing textile mills. They were tight-knit communities made up of textile workers, their families and sometimes management. Mill village residents usually did not leave the area around the factory, because textile companies provided food, goods and other necessities. The village at Erwin Mill was no different. The company built houses alongside the mill in the early 1890s {{and by the end of}} the 19th century hundreds of workers lived in single-family homes around the mill.|$|E
