5|$|Horse {{ownership}} {{was widespread}} by the 12th century. Both tenant farmers and landlords {{were involved in}} the harrowing of land for arable crops in the relatively new open field system, and employed horses for this work. Horses and carts were increasingly used for transporting farm goods and implements; peasants were obliged to transport such items in their own carts, though the poorest may have had to rely on one horse for all their farm work. The necessity for carting produce revolutionised communication between villages. Horse-breeding as <b>an</b> <b>enterprise</b> continued; in the 14th century, Hexham Priory had 80broodmares, the Prior of Durham owned two stud farms, Rievaulx Abbey owned one, Gilbert d'Umfraville, Earl of Angus, in Scotland, had significant grazing lands for mares, and horse-breeding was being carried out both east and west of the Pennines.|$|E

Field of New Jersey started <b>an</b> <b>enterprise</b> {{to develop}} the Florida coast from Key Biscayne to Jupiter by {{clearing}} native vegetation, leveling Indian midden mounds and beach dunes, and planting coconuts. Osborn and Field imported 300,000unhusked coconuts from the Caribbean, of which 76,000 were planted on Key Biscayne. Most of the shoots from the coconuts on Key Biscayne were eaten by rats and marsh rabbits (Sylvilagus palustris). As {{a result of their}} efforts, in 1885 Osborn and Field were allowed to purchase Key Biscayne and other oceanfront land from the Florida Internal Improvement Trust Fund for 70cents an acre.|$|E
5|$|Horse {{improvement}} as a goal, {{and horse}} breeding as <b>an</b> <b>enterprise,</b> date to medieval times; King John imported a hundred Flemish stallions, Edward III imported fifty Spanish stallions, and various priories and abbeys owned stud farms. Laws were passed restricting and prohibiting horse exports {{and for the}} culling of horses considered undesirable in type. By the 17th century, specific horse breeds were being recorded as suitable for specific purposes, and new horse-drawn agricultural machinery was being designed. Fast coaches pulled by teams of horses with Thoroughbred blood could make use of improved roads, and coaching inn proprietors owned hundreds of horses to support the trade. Steam power took {{over the role of}} horses in agriculture from the mid-19th century, but horses continued to be used in warfare for almost another 100 years, as their speed and agility over rough terrain remained unequalled. Working horses had all but disappeared from Britain by the 1980s, and today horses in Britain are kept almost wholly for recreational purposes.|$|E

5|$|The Scottish {{education}} system underwent radical change and {{expansion in the}} 20th century. In 1918 Roman Catholic schools were brought into the system, but retained their distinct religious character, access to schools by priests and the requirement that school staff be acceptable to the Church. The school leaving age was raised to 14 in 1901, and although plans to raise it to 15 in the 1940s were never ratified, increasing numbers stayed on beyond elementary education and it was eventually raised to 16 in 1973. As a result, secondary education was the major area {{of growth in the}} inter-war period, particularly for girls, who stayed on in full-time education in increasing numbers throughout the century. New qualifications were developed to cope with changing aspirations and economics, with the Leaving Certificate being replaced by the Scottish Certificate of Education Ordinary Grade ('O-Grade') and Higher Grade ('Higher') qualifications in 1962, which became the basic entry qualification for university study. The centre of the {{education system}} also became more focused on Scotland, with the ministry of education partly moving north in 1918 and then finally having its headquarters relocated to Edinburgh in 1939. After devolution, in 1999 the new Scottish Executive set up an Education Department and <b>an</b> <b>Enterprise,</b> Transport and Lifelong Learning Department, which together took over its functions. One of the major diversions from practice in England, possible because of devolution, was the abolition of student tuition fees in 1999, instead retaining a system of means-tested student grants.|$|E

30|$|Based on {{empirical}} evidence from enterprises in Jiangsu Province, this paper studies key influencing factors of their innovation {{activities at the}} micro level. Results show that a “threshold effect” and a reversed U-shaped relationship exist between <b>an</b> <b>enterprise’s</b> size and intensity of its innovation input when factors such as brand, entrepreneur background, HR, industrial and regional differences are controlled. Agglomeration effect is found influencing <b>an</b> <b>enterprise’s</b> innovation activities negatively rather than positively. A non-linear relationship is also found between <b>an</b> <b>enterprise’s</b> innovation activities and export ratio, showing a “capture effect”. A behavior mode {{of the effects of}} these influencing factors on innovation activities of China’s manufacturing enterprises is established and implications are provided.|$|R

25|$|The Zachman Framework is <b>an</b> <b>enterprise</b> {{ontology}} and is {{a fundamental}} structure for Enterprise Architecture which provides a formal and structured way of viewing and defining <b>an</b> <b>enterprise.</b> The ontology is a two dimensional classification schema that reflects the intersection between two historical classifications. The first are primitive interrogatives: What, How, When, Who, Where, and Why. The second {{is derived from the}} philosophical concept of reification, the transformation of an abstract idea into an instantiation. The Zachman Framework reification transformations are: Identification, Definition, Representation, Specification, Configuration and Instantiation.|$|E

25|$|Only a tiny {{fraction}} of the detected errors ends up as not correctable. For example, specification for <b>an</b> <b>enterprise</b> SAS disk (a model from 2013) estimates this fraction to be one uncorrected error in every 1016 bits, and another SAS enterprise disk from 2013 specifies similar error rates. Another modern (as of 2013) enterprise SATA disk specifies an error rate of less than 10 non-recoverable read errors in every 1016 bits. <b>An</b> <b>enterprise</b> disk with a Fibre Channel interface, which uses 520 byte sectors to support the Data Integrity Field standard to combat data corruption, specifies similar error rates in 2005.|$|E
30|$|Since {{most of the}} {{surveyed}} enterprises {{were not}} listed companies, our measure of business performance rested mainly on <b>an</b> <b>enterprise’s</b> ability to generate profit.

It well reflects the return on owners’ equity. ROE[*]=[*](net revenue/shareholders’ equity)[*]*[*] 100  %. We set the profit of enterprises that have negative net profits to zero. Since the ROE curve is right skewed, we applied the logarithm before modeling.|$|R
