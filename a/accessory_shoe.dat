5000|$|The Multi Interface Shoe is a {{proprietary}} camera hotshoe introduced by Sony on 12 September 2012, replacing {{an assortment of}} other proprietary hotshoes used by Sony in various types of cameras in the past, including the Auto-lock <b>Accessory</b> <b>Shoe</b> (aka AAS or [...] "iISO" [...] shoe) introduced by Minolta in 1988 and used on Sony α DSLRs, SLTs and some NEX cameras, and the Smart Accessory Terminals types 1 (SAT) and 2 (SAT2) used on {{the majority of the}} Sony α NEX-line. It also replaces Sony's former Cyber-shot hotshoe, Intelligent <b>Accessory</b> <b>Shoe</b> (IAS) and Active Interface Shoe (AIS).|$|E

50|$|The 4-pin Auto-lock <b>Accessory</b> <b>Shoe</b> (a.k.a. iISO hotshoe) on all Sony DSLRs/SLTs {{and some}} NEX models up to 2012-08 was {{introduced}} by Minolta in 1988 for their Maxxum/Dynax/α series of A-mount AF SLRs and was also used on their digital DiMAGE A cameras series. It offers a slide-on auto-locking mechanism but is mechanically incompatible with hotshoes based on the ISO 518 standard as utilized by most other camera and accessory manufacturers. A compatible 7-pin variant existed as well, but was rarely used by Minolta, {{and not at all}} by Sony. The passive adapters Minolta FS-1100 and FS-PC allow to adapt Minolta AF and TTL flashes with ISO-based foot to cameras with Auto-lock <b>Accessory</b> <b>Shoe,</b> whereas the FS-1200 allows to use AF TTL flashes with Auto-lock Accessory Foot on earlier Minolta SLRs. These adapters provide no voltage protection or galvanic isolation, but they maintain TTL support with Minolta film cameras. Digital cameras, however, require digital-ready flashes for TTL support. If no TTL support, but voltage protection and galvanic isolation is required, the Sony FA-HS1AM can be used instead to mount ISO-based equipment on Auto-lock <b>Accessory</b> <b>Shoe</b> cameras. If no electrical connection is required, the mechanical adapter Sony FA-SA1AM can be used as well.|$|E
50|$|An <b>accessory</b> <b>shoe</b> {{was on the}} top of the housing, {{but without}} a 'hot-shoe' contact. The rewind knob held a film speed reminder, {{covering}} ASA 8-800/DIN 10-30, but no folding rewind handle. The frame counter needed to be reset manually. It counted down from the number of exposures in the roll to zero.|$|E
50|$|The optical viewfinder, with {{individual}} eyesight adjustment, is mounted in an <b>accessory</b> <b>shoe</b> slightly offset to the left-hand {{side on the}} top plate. It matches the field-of-view of the standard 50mm camera lens. It may be replaced by separately available ones matching {{the field of view}} of interchangeable lenses of the photographer's choice.|$|E

Some of their NEX cameras used a proprietary Smart Accessory Terminal (versions 1 and 2). In September 2012, Sony announced a new ISO-based 21+3 pin Multi Interface Shoe for use with their future digital cameras and camcorders of the Alpha, NEX, Handycam, NXCAM and Cyber-shot series. This quick-lock hotshoe is mechanically and electrically compatible with a standard 2-pin ISO-518 hotshoe, but electrically compatible with the previous Auto-lock <b>Accessory</b> <b>Shoe</b> with extensions, so that passive adapters ADP-AMA and ADP-MAA allow to use digital-ready iISO flashes on new cameras and some new Multi Interface Shoe equipment on older cameras, while providing compatibility with standard ISO-based equipment as well.|$|E

50|$|The OM2n MD used <b>accessory</b> <b>shoe</b> 4 {{with two}} {{additional}} contacts above the main central sync point. This shoe used two small pins {{to make contact}} with the camera circuitry. For this purpose an OM2n MD will have the large securing threaded recess used for shoe 1 on the older OM2 MD plus two smaller recesses for the added contacts visible on the rear of the prism above the viewfinder. The flash shoes are not backwardly interchangeable between models.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, {{the first}} concept study got an {{immovable}} lens tube. The original movable sliding tube {{was one of}} the most expensive parts, because it had to be precisely manufactured on a lathe for a light tight fitting. The second concept study retained the sliding tube for the lens, but used a selenium light meter. A light meter for the <b>accessory</b> <b>shoe</b> was assigned to be built by Gossen in early 1968, but finally an uncoupled light meter was integrated in the camera housing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanical}} {{design of the}} <b>accessory</b> <b>shoe</b> now common on most cameras dates back to 1913, when Oskar Barnack, {{the inventor of the}} Leica, devised it for attaching an accessory viewfinder. By 1940's, with the addition of the central contact, the design became commonly used for attaching and triggering accessory flashes and known as the [...] "hot-shoe". Prior to 1988, Minolta has used that familiar, common hot-shoe design, adding, just like the other makers, its own proprietary contacts for enhanced control.|$|E
