5000|$|Born Jo Ann Gibson, near Culloden, Georgia on April 17, 1912, {{she was the}} {{youngest}} of twelve children. Her parents were Owen Boston and Dollie Webb Gibson who had owned a farm. She attended Fort Valley State College and then became a public school teacher in Macon, where she was married to Wilbur Robinson for a short time. Five years later, she went to Atlanta, where she earned an M.A. in English at Atlanta University. After teaching in Texas she then accepted a position at Alabama State College in Montgomery. It was there she joined the Women's Political Council, which Mary Fair Burks had founded three years earlier. In part the WPC was an organization dedicated to increasing voter registration in the African American community. In 1949, Robinson was verbally attacked by a bus driver for sitting in the front [...] "Whites only" [...] section of the bus. Her response to the incident was to attempt to start a protest boycott. But, when she approached her fellow members of the Women’s Political Council with her story and proposal, she was told that it was “a fact of life in Montgomery.” In late 1950, she succeeded Burks as president of the WPC and helped focus the group's efforts on bus abuses. Robinson was an outspoken critic of the treatment of African-Americans on public transportation. She was also active in the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. The Women's Political Council had made complaints <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> seating to the Montgomery City Commission and about abusive drivers, and achieved some concessions, including an undertaking that drivers would be courteous and having buses stopping at every corner in black neighborhoods, as they did in white areas.|$|E

40|$|A {{discussion}} is presented of various structure-preserving models for power systems {{along with their}} differential-algebraic and local-normal-form representations. The different models emanate {{from a variety of}} the generator and load damping properties. The equilibria of interest reflect the bus power imbalance after a fault and depend {{on the nature of the}} generator and load damping. The classical view of dynamical system equilibria cannot be applied to these models unless an unrealistic assumption <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> real power balance is made. Transformations of frequency and bus power resolve this difficulty. The results provide a useful basis for the derivation of energy functions of power systems and their justification as Lyapunov functions. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
