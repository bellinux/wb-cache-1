40|$|Autoimmune neuropathies are a {{group of}} {{conditions}} resulting from inflammatory attack of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), an <b>acute</b> <b>autoimmune</b> <b>neuropathy,</b> presents in both axonal and demyelinating forms. Axonal forms of GBS are caused by autoantibodies which target gangliosides on peripheral nerves. Here, they cause axonal damage via activation of the complement pathway. In ex vivo preparations, anti-ganglioside antibodies {{have been shown to}} cause complement-mediated injury to the node of Ranvier and the motor nerve terminal. Of these two vulnerable sites, the motor nerve terminal has recently been shown to be able to internalise anti-ganglioside antibody while the node of Ranvier does not. Rabbit models have demonstrated that immunisation with ganglioside results in a motor axonal neuropathy but no such model currently exists in mice. This is partially {{due to the fact that}} wildtype mice respond poorly when immunised with ganglioside and partially due to the requirement of an exogenous complement source to cause injury. This laboratory has recently developed GalNAcT-/ [...] Tg(neuronal) and GalNAcT-/ [...] Tg(glial) mice with complex ganglioside expression restricted to neurons and glia, respectively. This thesis aimed to develop a mouse model of GBS by actively immunising these mice with ganglioside liposomes. Subsequently, the aims were expanded to look at the clearance of the antibodies by membranes which express their ganglioside target. To complete these aims, wildtype, GalNAcT-/-, GalNAcT-/ [...] Tg(neuronal) and GalNAcT-/ [...] Tg(glial) mice were compared. Following immunisation with liposomes containing GD 1 b, wildtype mice responded poorly as demonstrated by low presence of immunoglobulin in their sera. Conversely, GalNAcT-/- mice, which lack complex gangliosides, showed high presence of immunoglobulin in their sera. GalNAcT-/ [...] Tg(neuronal) and GalNAcT-/ [...] Tg(glial) mice showed intermediate levels. This was assumed to be due to varying levels of tolerance to “self” lipids among the mice. However, when normal human serum was introduced, GalNAcT-/ [...] Tg(neuronal) and GalNAcT-/ [...] Tg(glial) mice did not show any complement-mediated injury. Based upon evidence from ELISpots from the splenocytes of these mice, there did not appear to be any major differences in anti-GD 1 b antibody-producing cells among genotypes. The possibility that the antibodies produced by these mice were being removed by internalisation was investigated at the NMJ ex vivo and in vivo. Ex vivo, antibodies against complex gangliosides were demonstrated to be cleared in a receptor-dependent and activity-dependent manner. Following passive immunisation with pathogenic monoclonal antibody in vivo, serum levels of the antibody were cleared rapidly in wildtype mice but remain elevated at 7 days in GalNAcT-/- mice. GalNAcT-/ [...] Tg(neuronal) mice cleared antibody at an intermediate rate. Non-pathogenic antibodies were not cleared from the circulation over the 7 days from any of the three genotypes. These results have demonstrated that levels of anti-ganglioside antibody can be regulated by receptor-dependent internalisation, especially at the motor nerve terminal. These studies have highlighted this structure as a novel regulator of anti-ganglioside antibody in vivo. The clearance of antibody is also dependent on the ability of the antibody to bind to living tissue; therefore antibodies detected in patient serum may not represent pathogenic, disease-causing antibodies. These factors may profoundly influence host vulnerability to antibody-mediated disease by affecting circulating levels of pathological antibodies...|$|E
40|$|Guillain-Barré {{syndrome}} {{is the most}} common and most severe acute paralytic neuropathy, with about 100   000 people developing the disorder every year worldwide. Under the umbrella term of Guillain-Barré syndrome are several recognisable variants with distinct clinical and pathological features. The severe, generalised manifestation of Guillain-Barré syndrome with respiratory failure affects 20 – 30 % of cases. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange is the optimal management approach, alongside supportive care. Understanding of the infectious triggers and immunological and pathological mechanisms has advanced substantially in the past 10 years, and is guiding clinical trials investigating new treatments.

40|$|Immune {{responses}} {{directed towards}} gangliosides and their microbial mimics are important mediators of several subtypes of <b>acute</b> post-infectious <b>autoimmune</b> <b>neuropathy,</b> collectively {{referred to as}} the Guillain–Barré syndromes. In this diverse group of paralytic syndromes, the immunopathology is in a proportion of cases characterised by anti-ganglioside antibody deposits, accompanied by inflammatory destruction of both axonal and glial components within the PNS. By gaining an understanding of the immunological mechanisms underlying these pathological pathways, {{it should be possible to}} select the correct targets for therapeutic intervention. Recent years has seen particular progress in our understanding of the basis for, and immunological consequences of molecular mimicry between gangliosides and microbial glycans, the relationships between ganglioside antibody specificity and different clinical phenotypes of GBS, the pathological basis for antibody-mediated nerve injury and the testing of intervention strategies in pre-clinical models.

40|$|Guillain-Barré {{syndrome}} and its variant, Miller-Fisher syndrome, are <b>acute,</b> postinfectious, <b>autoimmune</b> <b>neuropathies</b> that frequently follow Campylobacter jejuni enteritis. The pathogenesis {{is believed to}} involve molecular mimicry between sialylated epitopes on C. jejuni LPSs and neural gangliosides. More than 90 % of Miller-Fisher syndrome cases have serum anti-GQ 1 b and anti-GT 1 a ganglioside antibodies that may also react with other disialylated gangliosides including GD 3 and GD 1 b. Structural studies on LPS from neuropathy-associated C. jejuni strains have revealed GT 1 a-like and GD 3 -like core oligosaccharides. To determine whether this structural mimicry results in pathogenic autoantibodies, we immunized mice with GT 1 a/GD 3 -like C. jejuni LPS and then cloned mAb’s that reacted with both the immunizing LPS and GQ 1 b/GT 1 a/GD 3 gangliosides. Immunohistology demonstrated antibody binding to ganglioside-rich sites including motor nerve terminals. In ex vivo electrophysiological studies of nerve terminal function, application of antibodies either ex vivo or in vivo via passive immunization induced massive quantal release of acetylcholine, followed by neurotransmission block. This effect was complement-dependent and associated with extensive deposits of IgM and C 3 c at nerve terminals. These data provide {{strong support for the}} molecular mimicry hypothesis as a mechanism for the induction of cross-reactive pathogenic anti-ganglioside/LPS antibodies in postinfectious neuropathies...|$|R

40|$|Inflammatory neuropathies {{represent}} disabling human {{autoimmune disorders}} with considerable disease variability. Animal models provide insights into defined {{aspects of their}} disease pathogenesis. Forkhead box P 3 (FoxP 3) + regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) are anti-inflammatory cells that maintain immune tolerance and counteract tissue damage {{in a variety of}} immune-mediated disorders. Dysfunction or a reduced frequency of Tregs have been associated with different human autoimmune disorders. We here analyzed the functional relevance of Tregs in determining disease manifestation and severity in murine models of <b>autoimmune</b> <b>neuropathies.</b> We took advantage of the DEREG mouse system allowing depletion of Treg with high specificity as well as anti-CD 25 directed antibodies to deplete Tregs in mice in actively induced experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN). Furthermore antibody-depletion was performed in an adoptive transfer model of chronic neuritis. Early Treg depletion increased clinical EAN severity both in active and adoptive transfer chronic neuritis. This was accompanied by increased proliferation of myelin specific T cells and histological signs of peripheral nerve inflammation. Late stage Treg depletion after initial disease manifestation however did not exacerbate inflammatory neuropathy symptoms further. We conclude that Tregs determine disease severity in experimental <b>autoimmune</b> <b>neuropathies</b> during the initial priming phase, but have no major disease modifying function after disease manifestation. Potential future therapeutic approaches targeting Tregs should thus be performed early in inflammatory neuropathies...|$|R

As these immune responses resemble <b>acute</b> <b>autoimmune</b> hepatitis, it was examined whether autoantibody production and the activation of autoantibody-producing B- 1 cells were accompanied by this phenomenon. Autoantibodies against Hep- 2 cells and double-stranded DNA were detected in sera as early as day 3 (showing a peak at day 14) when mice were treated with α-GalCer.
