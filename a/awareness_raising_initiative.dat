40|$|Part 10 : EthicsInternational audienceFailures to {{consider}} the ethical aspects of technology development and design have resulted in significant negative impacts on individuals over the last decade. In consequence {{we have seen the}} emergence and growing interest in technology design movements such as “value sensitive design” and “privacy by design” aimed at specifically addressing issues of social and ethical impact. However, there {{is still a long way}} to go in raising awareness of ethical issues in technology design. This paper presents research undertaken as part of the European co-funded project “EGAIS’ which addresses precisely this issue of ethics consideration in technology development. A key component of the <b>awareness</b> <b>raising</b> <b>initiative</b> in technology design is the use of scenarios to prompt thinking across a range of stakeholders, and with this in mind the authors conducted a workshop at this IFIP Summer School using a scenario to stimulate discussion and promote ‘context aware’ thinking.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{investigate}} {{and compare the}} predictors of personal and perceived stigma associated with depression. Method Three samples were surveyed to investigate the predictors: a national sample of 1, 001 Australian adults; a local community sample of 5, 572 residents of the Australian Capital Territory and Queanbeyan aged 18 to 50 years; and a psychologically distressed subset (n = 487) of the latter sample. Personal and Perceived Stigma were measured using the two subscales of the Depression Stigma Scale. Potential predictors included demographic variables (age, gender, education, country of birth, remoteness of residence), psychological distress, awareness of Australia's national depression initiative beyondblue, depression literacy and level of exposure to depression. Not all predictors were used for all samples. Results Personal stigma was consistently higher among men, those with less education and those born overseas. It was also associated with greater current psychological distress, lower prior contact with depression, not having heard of a national <b>awareness</b> <b>raising</b> <b>initiative,</b> and lower depression literacy. These findings differed from those for perceived stigma except for psychological distress which was associated with both higher personal and higher perceived stigma. Remoteness of residence {{was not associated with}} either type of stigma. Conclusion The findings highlight the importance of treating the concepts of personal and perceived stigma separately in designing measures of stigma, in interpreting the pattern of findings in studies of the predictors of stigma, and in designing, interpreting the impact of and disseminating interventions for stigma. </p...|$|E

40|$|In today’s {{business}} environment all business operations are enabled by technology. Its always on and connected nature has brought new business possibilities {{but at the}} same time has increased the number of potential threats. Information security has become an established discipline as more and more businesses realize its value. Many surveys have indicated the importance of protecting valuable information and an important aspect that must be addressed in this regard is information security awareness. The human component has been recognized to have an important role in information security since the only way to reduce security risks is through making employees more information security aware. This also means that employees take responsibility of their actions when dealing with information in their everyday activities. The research is concentrated mainly on information security concepts alongside their relation to the human factor with evidence that users remain susceptible to information security threats, thus illustrating the need for more effective user training in order to raise the level of security awareness. Two surveys were undertaken in order to investigate the potential of raising security awareness within existing education systems by measuring the level of security awareness amongst the online population. The surveys analyzed not only the awareness levels and needs of students during their study and their preparation towards entering the workforce, but also whether this awareness level changes as they progress in their studies. The results of both surveys established that the awareness level of students concerning information security concepts is not at a sufficient level for students entering university education and does not significantly change as they progress their academic life towards entering the workforce. In respect to this, the research proposes and develops the information security toolkit as a prototype <b>awareness</b> <b>raising</b> <b>initiative.</b> The research goes one step further by piloting and evaluating toolkit effectiveness. As an awareness raising method, the toolkit will be the basis for the general technology user to understand the challenges associated with secure use of information technology and help him assess its current knowledge, identify lacks and weaknesses and acquire the required knowledge in order to be competent and confident users of technology.

40|$|Today {{we live in}} an {{information}} society that is constantly growing in terms of the amount of information that are processed, stored, and communicated. Information security is a field that is of concern for both the individual and the society as a whole, as both groups are exposed to information every day. A society like this will demand more emphasis on information security. Previous researchers that has addressed this problem argues that security awareness is the most significant factor in order to raise the general security level. They also mention education as a solution to increase the security awareness and thereby achieve a secure environment. The aim of this thesis is to examine the differences between trained and untrained home users in security awareness and behaviour. The research was conducted, using a quantitative method in form of a survey research with the distribution of self-completion questionnaires. The study has a total of 162 respondents that participated. The result was presented and analysed through the use of the software program, IBM SPSS. The results of the findings suggest that the awareness of the trained home users is higher than of those who are untrained home users. Additionally, the discussion suggests that the home users who have participated in <b>awareness</b> <b>raising</b> <b>initiatives,</b> such as education and training, does not necessarily apply more security measures in their home environment, than those who are regarded as untrained home users. Hence, this study suggests that the increase in awareness may not necessarily be the only factor that affects the user’s behaviour, since those who have not participated in <b>awareness</b> <b>raising</b> <b>initiatives</b> applies security measures, almost to the same extent to those who have. This thesis might be able to act as a foundation for future research within the field, considering that the research is a comparative study between trained and untrained home users of the variables security awareness and behaviour where the found results, does not fully agree with previous research. However, an increase in awareness is a good start, but may need to be paired with appropriate training from other parties, such as internet service providers (ISPs) and banks. Maybe the solution could be to develop and strive for a continuous information security culture of the Swedish society, which may result in a deeper learning and understanding of security issues and inspire home users to be engaged and proactive about their information security behaviour...|$|R

Unfortunately, {{it has long been}} understood that good security cannot be achieved through technical means alone and a solid understanding of the issues and how to protect yourself is required from users. Whilst many initiatives, programs and strategies have been proposed to improve the level of information security awareness, most have been directed at organizations, with a few national programs focused upon home users. Given people 2 ̆ 7 s use of technology is primarily focused upon those two areas: the workplace and home, this paper seeks to understand the knowledge and practice relationship between these environments.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of public perception {{to climate change}} is an essential factor {{in the development of}} adaptation policies. In the Mediterranean, agriculture, as the largest consumer of freshwater, has the highest potential to suffer adverse impacts of climate change. Future water availability predictions, conflicting interests among stakeholders and an increasing social concern about the environment further aggravate the situation. Therefore studying public support for adaptation policies can {{play a key role in}} successfully adapting the sector. The study site, approximately 36, 000 hectares of rice fields in Seville (Spain), exemplifies an area in the Mediterranean where water needs to be carefully re-allocated in view of the limitations anticipated by climate change scenarios; in particular where conflicts will arise between water for agriculture and water for ‘natural’ ecosystems. This paper proposes an ex-ante evaluation of the societal support for adaptation policies. A survey of 117 respondents was conducted and a Logit model utilized to analyze which predictors positively or negatively affect people's support for adaptation policies. Results suggest that the main barriers to support these policies were economic losses and low climate change concern whereas the primary motivation factor was environmental commitment. Additionally, the main socio-demographic determinants were gender, age, education and family structure. In order to improve societal support for climate change adaptation policies, implementing educational and <b>awareness</b> <b>raising</b> <b>initiatives</b> will be the main challenges for policy makers to overcome...|$|R

This study explored the current service provision for children with autism and their families in Ethiopia, the existing challenges and urgent needs, and stakeholders’ views on the best approaches to further develop services. Methods. A situational analysis was conducted based on i) qualitative interviews with existing service providers; ii) consultation with a wider group of stakeholders through two stakeholder workshops; and iii) information available in the public domain. Findings were triangulated where possible. Results. Existing diagnostic and educational services for children with autism are scarce and largely confined to Ethiopia’s capital city, with little provision in rural areas. Families of children with autism experience practical and psychosocial challenges, including severe stigma. Informants further raised the lack of culturally and contextually appropriate autism instruments as an important problem to be addressed. The study informants and local stakeholders provided several approaches for future service provision expansion, including service decentralisation, mental health training and <b>awareness</b> <b>raising</b> <b>initiatives.</b> Conclusions. Services for children with autism in Ethiopia are extremely limited; appropriate care for these children is further impeded by stigma and lack of awareness. Ethiopia’s plans to scale up mental healthcare integrated in primary healthcare provides an opportunity to expand services for children with autism and other developmental disorders. These plans and additional strategies outlined in this paper can help to address the current service provision gaps and may also inform service enhancement approaches in other low-income countries...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nepal is {{experiencing}} a significant 'treatment gap' in mental health care. People with mental disorders do not always receive appropriate treatment due {{to a range of}} structural and individual issues, including stigma and poverty. The PRIME (Programme for Improving Mental Health Care) programme has developed a mental health care plan to address this issue in Nepal and four other low and middle income countries. This study aims to inform the development of this comprehensive care plan by investigating the perceptions of stakeholders at different levels of the care system in the district of Chitwan in southern Nepal: health professionals, lay workers and community members. It focuses specifically on issues of demand and access to care, and aims to identify barriers and potential solutions for reaching people with priority mental disorders. METHODS: This qualitative study consisted of key informant interviews (33) and focus group discussions (83 participants in 9 groups) at community and health facility levels. Data were analysed using a framework analysis approach. RESULTS: As well as pragmatic barriers at the health facility level, mental health stigma and certain cultural norms were found to reduce access and demand for services. Respondents perceived the lack of awareness about mental health problems to be a major problem underlying this, even among those with high levels of education or status. They proposed strategies to improve awareness, such as channelling education through trusted and respected community figures, and responding to the need for openness or privacy in educational programmes, depending on the issue at hand. Adapting to local perceptions of stigmatised treatments emerged as another key strategy to improve demand. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies barriers to accessing care in Nepal that reach beyond the health facility and into the social fabric of the community.

40|$|Thesis (MPhil (Sustainable Development Planning and Management)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Gender {{equality}} {{and access to}} basic water services are complexly interlinked objectives for both poverty alleviation and sustainable development. In South Africa, research shows that despite the emphasis on mainstreaming gender equality in the water services sector, (and the concomitant policies and structures) the lives of poor women in this sector are not substantively being transformed. This study was therefore aimed at deriving principles that would enhance the impact of gender mainstreaming in the water services sector, and at evaluating current South African guidelines according to these principles. The study was qualitative in nature, and both theoretical and empirical information was used to derive the above principles. The initial literature survey indicated {{a need for a}} systemic approach to gender mainstreaming in the water services sector. Therefore, theoretical information was principally obtained from literature on poverty, sustainable development, complexity theory, feminism and governance. Empirical information was obtained from three sources, namely (1) participant observation of the meetings of the Strategic Advisory Group on Gender of the Water Services Sector Leadership Group (WSSLG), (2) individual interviews with a range of stakeholders, and (3) focus group interviews with community members involved in six water services projects – three each in the Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga Provinces. The study resulted in a proposed framework of fourteen focus areas for gender mainstreaming in the water services sector. These focus areas, along with illustrative questions, are the following: (1) Policy premises and formulation (Is the policy premised on equity and poverty alleviation?) (2) Approach to gender mainstreaming (How is the 50 / 50 campaign being implemented?) (3) The role of the gender officials (Is the gender focal point part of the strategic management team?) (4) Co-operative governance (Are IDP officials and women’s organizations involved?) (5) Public participation (Is the public participation process adequately resourced?) (6) Advocacy and <b>awareness</b> <b>raising</b> (Do family gender relations feature in <b>awareness</b> <b>raising</b> <b>initiatives?)</b> (7) Access to basic services (Are women specifically targeted in service provision?) (8) HIV/AIDS and gender-based violence (What measures are in place to decrease the risk of disease?) (9) Economic empowerment (Are the employment opportunities created sustainable?) (10) Leadership by women (How is the leadership capacity of women being developed?) (11) Capacity development of women (Is the training aimed at portable skills?) (12) Project/programme management (What monitoring and evaluation processes are being used?) (13) Environmental sustainability (What measures are in place to conserve water and reduce pollution?) (14) Engaging with traditional culture (How are restrictive cultural traditions addressed?) When the above framework was applied to the WSSLG Gender Mainstreaming Strategy and Action Plan (DWAF, 2005), the WSSLG strategy was in certain respects found to be non-responsive to the learning garnered in this study. Particularly, the WSSLG strategy neither adopts a poverty alleviation approach, nor addresses environmental sustainability and traditional culture. It also does not facilitate co-operative governance and programme management. Finally, gender inequality in the water services sector impedes both poverty alleviation and sustainable development. Systemic solutions are required, and these study results might be germane to these...|$|R

Drug and Alcohol Task Forces have been identified as the appropriate structures through which the measure will be implemented. Funding of € 50, 000 will be available to each Task Force equating to a total of € 1. 2 million for 2015. Ends Note to Editors The Dormant Accounts Act 2001 together with the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Act 2003 and the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Acts 2005 - 2012 provide a framework for the administration of unclaimed accounts in credit institutions (i. e. banks, building societies and An Post) and unclaimed life assurance policies in insurance undertakings and in this regard, institutions/undertakings are required to take steps to identify and contact the owners of dormant accounts and unclaimed life assurance policies. The legislation also provides for a scheme for the disbursement of funds that are unlikely to be reclaimed. In each year monies may be disbursed in accordance with Part 6 of the 2012 Act, from the Account, but only for the purposes of programmes or projects to assist: 1. the personal and social development of persons who are economically or socially disadvantaged; 2. the educational development of persons who are educationally disadvantaged or 3. persons with a disability (within the meaning of the Equal Status Act 2000).

40|$|In {{the rapidly}} {{advancing}} {{field of the}} life sciences, issues relating to responsibility for research are becoming a key area of discussion. Attempting to conceptualise how individual and collective responsibilities {{may be attributed to}} scientists for their research is proving both difficult and complex. Issues relating to responsibility for research may be loosely divided into two different areas. Internal responsibilities refer to those that scientists hold to their research and their colleagues to ensure that high quality data is produced with integrity. Broad social responsibilities, in contrast, reflect the social contract that scientists hold with society and refer to the commitment of scientific research to enhance and promote humanity in a manner that takes into consideration social priorities and norms. By far, research on internal responsibilities has formed the bulk of current discussions on responsibility in life science ethics. These responsibilities have come to be represented by the field of research ethics, which focuses on the prevention of misconduct and the promotion of globally harmonised approaches to daily conduct. Research ethics has been widely endorsed, and a high level of international agreement has resulted in country-specific approaches to <b>awareness</b> <b>raising</b> and pedagogy – such as the Responsible Conduct of Research approach developed in the USA – being applicable for use in divergent social contexts. In contrast, however, broad social issues have received comparatively less attention from the life science ethics community. Indeed, these topics often do not have a place in ethics curricula, or form “add-on” topics to ethics modules. This thesis suggests that presenting broad social issues as a progression of research ethics topics may cause considerable difficulties for pedagogy. In particular, this thesis suggests that these problems arise through the promotion of an internationally harmonised approach to research ethics, the focus on avoiding misconduct, and the reliance on informal teaching within laboratories as a fundamental aspect of perpetuating research ethics. This thesis suggests that the crucial issue of contextual variations within ethics discussions is often marginalised. I argue such variations may have considerable implications for how scientists engage with notions of professional responsibility. Such points are particularly salient when noting that many scientists in developing countries are introduced to these topics through Western-centric ethics modules that do not take into account social, regulatory and physical variations in research environments in these countries. In order to critically interrogate contextual variations and social responsibility, the thesis makes use of an interdisciplinary approach, using a variety of methods of investigation. The topic of dual-use – the potential for beneficial research to be misused by third parties for nefarious means – was taken as a focalising example of a broad social issue and formed the basis of comparative investigations with scientists in sub-Saharan Africa and the UK. The fieldwork results showed significant variations between how scientists in developing countries and developed countries interacted with the topic of dual-use. It became clear that the Western-centric approach promoted by most current dual-use <b>awareness</b> <b>raising</b> <b>initiatives,</b> and the implicit research ethics teaching approaches in these models, caused considerable difficulties for African scientists attempting to access these discussions. Using the theoretical framework outlined {{at the beginning of the}} thesis and the fieldwork, the thesis concludes by proposing a number of changes that could be made to the way that broad social issues are presented to scientists within ethics pedagogy.  Wellcome Trus...|$|R
