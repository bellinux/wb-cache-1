These were tested for their <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance</b> factors using eleven different antibiotics. Their ability to transfer <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>plasmids</b> to a sensitive E. coli strain (RR 1) was tested by transformation and conjugation experiments. Agarose gel electrophoresis was used to determine the size and number of the R-plasmids. Southern blotting was used to assess homologies between <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>plasmids</b> from different isolates. Among the isolates tested, 36. 7 % contained plasmids, and all these were from strains isolated from two hospitals. No R-plasmids could be detected among the multiple resistant strains isolated from the third hospital. Among the strains that contained plasmids, approximately 63. 6 % transferred multiple <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance</b> to E. coli and the rest transferred only one <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance</b> marker. The majority of strains carrying out the plasmids showed similarities in band number and size. In view of the similarities this group was denoted the predominant group, and selected for further molecular investigations. Restriction endonuclease digests of plasmids from this group gave the same restriction pattern which confirmed that they were closely related.

This study used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and plasmid analysis to further analyze the molecular epidemiology of Shigella flexneri strains isolated from hospitals and an urban community in Fortaleza, Brazil. Twenty-six strains of S. flexneri from three distinct areas {{in the city of}} Fortaleza, Brazil, were examined: 14 strains from people with diarrhea who lived in an urban community of 2, 000 persons, 5 strains from patients in the university hospital, and 7 strains from children in a pediatric hospital. PFGE identified six unique groups of S. flexneri circulating among patients during the 45 -month study. Seven strains were further studied for <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>plasmid</b> profiles. Three unique <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>plasmid</b> profiles were found. Strains collected from the hospitalized patients demonstrated the variety of PFGE and antibiotic resistance patterns in the area.
