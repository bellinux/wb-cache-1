50|$|Stalking is a {{controversial}} crime because a conviction {{does not require}} any physical harm. The anti-stalking statute of Illinois <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> controversial. It <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> restrictive, {{by the standards of}} this type of legislation.|$|R

5|$|All the {{functions}} of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These protein interactions can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence. Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication <b>are</b> <b>particularly</b> important.|$|E
5|$|Although the Ocosito ceramic {{tradition}} {{continued in}} use, the Late Preclassic ceramics in Takalik Abaj were {{strongly related to}} the Miraflores Ceramic Sphere that included Escuintla, the Valley of Guatemala and western El Salvador. This ceramic tradition consists of fine red wares that <b>are</b> <b>particularly</b> associated with Kaminaljuyu and are found throughout the southeastern Guatemalan highlands and the adjacent Pacific slope.|$|E
5|$|Banksia serrata has {{a central}} taproot and few lateral roots. Clusters of fine {{branched}} proteoid roots up to 15cm (6in) long arise from larger roots. These roots <b>are</b> <b>particularly</b> efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, {{such as the}} phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia.|$|E

5|$|During January and February winter storms {{become more}} likely {{than they are in}} December. While they do not affect the entire U.S., the Northeast and Midwest <b>are</b> <b>particularly</b> prone to them, along with most {{neighboring}} areas of Canada. This includes many major metropolitan areas, and movie markets, in both countries.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes called DNA ligases can rejoin cut {{or broken}} DNA strands. Ligases <b>are</b> <b>particularly</b> {{important}} in lagging strand DNA replication, as they join together the short segments of DNA produced at the replication fork into a complete {{copy of the}} DNA template. They are also used in DNA repair and genetic recombination.|$|E
5|$|Fat-rich plant {{products}} such as nuts and conifer seeds <b>are</b> <b>particularly</b> important as winter food {{in the north of}} the woodpecker's range, and can then supply more than 30% of the bird's energy requirements. Other plant items consumed include buds, berries and tree sap, the latter obtained by drilling rings of holes around a tree trunk.|$|E

5|$|In most Western music, tone {{clusters}} tend to {{be heard}} as dissonant. Clusters may be performed with almost any individual instrument on which three or more notes can be played simultaneously, {{as well as by}} most groups of instruments or voices. Keyboard instruments <b>are</b> <b>particularly</b> suited to the performance of tone clusters because it is relatively easy to play multiple notes in unison on them.|$|E
5|$|Like most Proteaceae, T.truncata has fine proteoid {{roots that}} arise from larger roots. These are roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. They <b>are</b> <b>particularly</b> efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, including the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. Waratah seeds are often eaten—and destroyed—by animals and do not travel far (just several metres) from the parent plants.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.telmatiaea has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These roots <b>are</b> <b>particularly</b> efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia.|$|E

5|$|Microorganisms are {{essential}} tools in biotechnology, biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology. The yeasts brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) are important model organisms in science, {{since they are}} simple eukaryotes that can be grown rapidly in large numbers and are easily manipulated. They <b>are</b> <b>particularly</b> valuable in genetics, genomics and proteomics, for example in protein production.|$|E
5|$|Modern weapons technologies, {{including}} the required research and development, <b>are</b> <b>particularly</b> capital-intensive and costly. The time between initial {{research and the}} deployment of weapon systems can be {{as long as a}} decade, during which the government must provide financial security and political justification for the project. In other words, the state not only provides the funding but also identifies a credible external enemy who warrants such expenditure.|$|E
5|$|Monitoring of {{the volcano}} and {{predictions}} of large eruptions <b>are</b> <b>particularly</b> important because of its location in a densely populated area, {{with the city of}} Kagoshima's 680,000 residents just a few kilometers from the volcano. The city conducts regular evacuation drills, and a number of shelters have been built where people can take refuge from falling volcanic debris.|$|E

5|$|Most Proteaceae and all Banksia species, {{including}} B.scabrella, have proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters of}} short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These roots <b>are</b> <b>particularly</b> efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. B.scabrella is highly susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.|$|E
5|$|Organ cases {{occasionally}} {{feature a}} few ranks of pipes protruding horizontally {{from the case}} {{in the manner of a}} row of trumpets.

5|$|Other highly {{specialized}} feeders include cookiecutter sharks, which feed on flesh sliced out of other larger fish and marine mammals. Cookiecutter teeth are enormous {{compared to the}} animal's size. The lower teeth <b>are</b> <b>particularly</b> sharp. Although {{they have never been}} observed feeding, they are believed to latch onto their prey and use their thick lips to make a seal, twisting their bodies to rip off flesh.|$|E
