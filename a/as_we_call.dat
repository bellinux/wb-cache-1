25|$|In England, {{during the}} Elizabethan and Jacobean eras, any {{stringed}} keyboard instrument was {{often described as}} a virginals, and could equally apply to a harpsichord or possibly even a clavichord or spinet. Thus, the masterworks of William Byrd and his contemporaries were often played on full-size, Italian or Flemish harpsichords, and {{not only on the}} virginals <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> it today. Contemporary nomenclature often referred to a pair of virginals, which implied a single instrument, possibly a harpsichord with two registers, or a double virginals (see below).|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s Kirchherr and her art school friends were {{involved}} in the European existentialist movement whose followers were later nicknamed [...] "Exis" [...] by Lennon. In 1995 she told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "Our philosophy then, because we were only little kids, was wearing black clothes and going around looking moody. Of course, we hadn't a clue who Jean-Paul Sartre was. We got inspired by all the French artists and writers, because that was the closest we could get. England was so far away, and America was out of the question. So France was the nearest. So we got all the information from France, and we tried to dress like the French existentialists... We wanted to be free, we wanted to be different, and tried to be cool, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> it now." ...|$|E

500|$|It is {{possible}} to conceive of disconnected spacetimes, each existing but unable to interact with one another. An easily visualized metaphor {{is a group of}} separate soap bubbles, in which observers living on one soap bubble cannot interact with those on other soap bubbles, even in principle. According to one common terminology, each [...] "soap bubble" [...] of spacetime is denoted as a universe, whereas our particular spacetime is denoted as the Universe, just <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> our moon the Moon. The entire collection of these separate spacetimes is denoted as the multiverse. With this terminology, different Universes are not causally connected to each other. In principle, the other unconnected Universes may have different dimensionalities and topologies of spacetime, different forms of matter and energy, and different physical laws and physical constants, although such possibilities are purely speculative. Others consider each of several bubbles created as part of chaotic inflation to be separate Universes, though in this model these universes all share a causal origin.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the band}} liked the demo, it was {{difficult}} for them to record the song. Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "At the time it sounded like a foreign language, whereas now we understand how it works". The arrangement, with two time signature shifts and frequent chord changes, was rehearsed many times, but the group struggled to get a performance they liked. According to co-producer Daniel Lanois, [...] "that was the science project song. I remember having this massive schoolhouse blackboard, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> them. I was holding a pointer, like a college professor, walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking nerd. It was ridiculous." [...] Co-producer Brian Eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name". The band worked on a single take for weeks, but as Eno explained, that particular version had a lot of problems with it and the group continued trying to fix it up. Through all of their work, they had gradually replaced each instrument take until nothing remained from the original performance.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} the 5th century BCE the Greek philosopher Hippo {{expressed}} the opinion that cultigens (<b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> them now) were produced from wild plants {{as the result of}} the care bestowed on them by man, a revolutionary view at a time when they were regarded as the special creation and gift of the gods. In devising ways of classifying organisms the philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BCE) established the important idea of a fundamentum divisionis — the principle that groups can be progressively subdivided. This has been assumed in biological classification ever since and is congruent with the relatively recent idea of evolution as descent with modification. All biological classification follows this principle of groups within groups, known as a nested hierarchy, but this form of classification does not necessarily presuppose evolution. [...] The earliest scientific (rather than utilitarian) approach to plants is attributed to Aristotle's student Theophrastus (371–286 BCE), known as the [...] "father of botany". In his Enquiry into Plants Theophrastus described 480 kinds of plant, dividing the plant kingdom into trees, shrubs, undershrubs and herbs with further subdivision into wild and cultivated, flowering and non-flowering, deciduous or evergreen.|$|E

2500|$|The name Pelargonium {{is derived}} from the Greek , pelargós (stork), because the seed head looks like a stork's beak. Dillenius {{originally}} suggested the name 'stork', because Geranium was named after a crane — [...] "a πελαργός, ciconia, sicuti vocamus Gerania, γερανός, grus" [...] (as pelargos, stork, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> the Gerania, geranos, crane). Despite the Latin, this {{should not be confused with}} the modern-day Ciconia genus, of birds in the stork family.|$|E
2500|$|The latest {{research}} {{into the life of}} Paul disputes his claim of conversion. In 2015, independent researchers P.J. Gott and Logan Licht reported evidence they discovered that suggests the books of the New Testament were written in [...] "enigmatical modes of expression," [...] the method Philo the Alexandrian Jew attributes to the Essene sect of Judaism. Josephus the Jewish historian writes, [...] "The Essenes also, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> a sect of ours … live the same kind of life as do those whom the Greeks call Pythagoreans …" ...|$|E
2500|$|Lind died at her {{residence}} at Brookside, Salthill, Slough, {{at the age}} of 61, having become ill rather suddenly that year. [...] Her obituary from The Times said, [...] "She was very pretty; she was very graceful; there was something appealing about her which might almost be called childish. She had a queer and very attractive little croak in her voice, and an elementary, little-girlish way of saying things which made them peculiarly engaging, and caused her saying of them to stick in the memory with a permanence which their wit or point might by no means justify. Add to this the enchanting lissomeness and beauty of all such movements as she was mistress of, and a stage personality (<b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> it) which was like no one else's, and there is more than justification for the glow which the remembrance of her performances kindles." [...] Lind's funeral took place at St. Mary's Church, Slough, on Friday, 31 August 1923, and she was buried in Windsor Cemetery.|$|E

30|$|The {{framework}} of the Kit-Build concept map is designed based on a concept map strategy, which includes a concept map construction tool, an automatic concept map assessment, and an analyzer of instructor. The significant component of the Kit-Build concept map is a “kit.” The kit consists of the concepts and the relations with linking words. These components are extracted from a concept map of an instructor (<b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>called</b> “goal map”) on the segmentation task. An automatic assessment methodology of the Kit-Build concept map is a proposition level exact matching between a goal map and concept map of learners (<b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>called</b> “learner map”). These abilities respond {{to the concerns of}} concept map assessment following a kit which is the quantity controller, and to the propositional exact matching based on the goal map which is the quality controller.|$|R
