2500|$|The {{most common}} mascot {{symbol for the}} party has been the donkey, or jackass.

Its most lasting impression came from the cartoons of Thomas Nast from 1870 in Harper's Weekly. Cartoonists followed Nast and used the donkey to represent the Democrats, and the elephant to represent the Republicans.|$|E
