Generalizing the Lagrangian used in that work, by inserting <b>a</b> <b>term</b> <b>containing</b> the basic vector of the AP-geometry, we have obtained {{a new class of}} path equations with <b>a</b> geometric <b>term</b> similar to Lorentz force term.

40|$|An {{algorithm}} is given for inverting functions defined by left-linear ground convergent rewrite systems, with left sides restricted in depth and right sides not having defined symbols at the top. 1 Introduction We {{are interested in}} the problem of solving equations of the form t = N, where t is <b>an</b> arbitrary <b>term</b> <b>containing</b> defined function symbols, constructors (that is, undefined function symbols), and variables, while N is <b>a</b> ground constructor <b>term,</b> by which we mean <b>a</b> <b>term</b> <b>containing</b> only constructors and constants. For example, given a definition of squaring, the square root of 9 is found by solving x 2 = sssssssss 0 (using the unary successor constructor s to represent integers), and the solution is x = sss 0. We describe a broad class of functions that can be inverted in this manner. To solve such problems, we restrict ourselves here to equational theories that can be presented as (rather typical) functional programs in the form of ground convergent left-linear rewrite systems, [...] ...|$|R

40|$|We {{promote the}} Immirzi {{parameter}} to be a minimally coupled scalar field and we analyzed the Hamiltonian constraints {{in the framework}} of Loop Quantum Gravity without the time gauge. Proper SU(2) connections can be defined and <b>a</b> <b>term</b> <b>containing</b> derivatives of the field β enters into their definition. Furthermore, boost degrees of freedom are non-dynamical, while the super-momentum constraints coincide with the scalar field case. Hence, the kinematical Hilbert space can be defined as for gravity in presence of a minimally coupled scalar field. Then, we analyzed the dynamical implications of this scenario and we outlined how a the dynamical relaxation to a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value is predicted. Comment: 5 page...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} entire solutions for a class of fourth order, dilation invariant, semilinear elliptic equations with power-type weights and with subcritical or critical growth in the nonlinear term. These equations define non compact variational problems and are characterized {{by the presence of}} <b>a</b> <b>term</b> <b>containing</b> lower order derivatives, whose strength is ruled by a parameter λ. We can prove existence of entire solutions found as extremal functions for some Rellich-Sobolev type inequalities. Moreover, when the nonlinearity is suitably close to the critical one and the parameter λ is large, symmetry breaking phenomena occur and in some cases the asymptotic behavior of radial and non radial ground states can be somehow described.

40|$|Abstract. The modern {{materials}} undergoing large elastic deformations and exhibiting strong {{magnetostrictive effect}} are modelled here by free energy functionals for nonlinear and non-local magnetoelastic behaviour. The {{aim of this}} work is to prove a new theorem which claims that a sequence of free energy functionals of slightly compressible magnetostrictive materials with a non-local elastic behaviour, converges to an energy functional of a nearly incompressible magnetostrictive material. This convergence {{is referred to as}} a Γ-convergence. The non-locality is limited to non-local elastic behaviour which is modelled by <b>a</b> <b>term</b> <b>containing</b> the second gradient of deformation in the energy functional. Key words: gamma-convergence, incompressibility, magnetostrictive material, second gradient of deformation, existence of minimizers. 1...|$|R
