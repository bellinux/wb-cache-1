40|$|Dual-use {{items are}} goods and {{technologies}} with civil and military uses. In several countries, including the EU Member States, {{the export of}} dual-use goods is controlled by national licensing processes {{as a measure of}} non-proliferation. Dual-use items relate to a variety of generally high-tech goods falling in diverse categories: nuclear materials, facilities and equipment; special materials and related equipment; materials processing; electronics; computers; telecommunications and information security; sensors and lasers; navigation and avionics; marine; <b>aerospace</b> <b>and</b> <b>propulsion.</b> In connection to the ongoing review of the EU export control policy, currently based on Regulation 428 / 2009 and amendments, it is of relevance to know the size of the EU dual-use sector and have a method to assess, in a quantitative way, the impact of export controls on trade. Because the dual-use trade draws from a range of industrial sectors, no single trade statistics exists today to portrait this cross-cutting sector ‘as a whole’. In this report we estimate the total intra- and extra-EU Dual-Use Export Value (DUEV). DUEV is meant to be an indicator of the relevance of the dual-use sector to the EU economy. To estimate DUEV, lower and upper bound values are first derived based on license data provided by EU Member States and on COMEXT export data available from Eurostat. The bounds are then combined in a single estimate to DUEV. As a result, DUEV is estimated to be at most 3. 3 % of the total intra- and extra-EU export in 2013, equivalent to about 150 Billion of Euros. The report explains the method used to derive these figures by qualitative reasoning on quantitative data. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|E

40|$|Products {{made from}} {{advanced}} ceramics show great promise for revolutionizing <b>aerospace</b> <b>and</b> terrestrial <b>propulsion,</b> <b>and</b> power generation. However, ceramic components {{are difficult to}} design because brittle materials in general have widely varying strength values. The CAPES/Life software eases this task by providing a tool to optimize the design and manufacture of brittle material components using probabilistic reliability analysis techniques. Probabilistic component design involves predicting the probability of failure for a thermomechanically loaded component from specimen rupture data. Typically, these experiments are performed using many simple geometry flexural or tensile test specimens. A static, dynamic, or cyclic load is applied to each specimen until fracture. Statistical strength and SCG (fatigue) parameters are then determined from these data. Using these parameters and the results obtained from a finite element analysis, the time-dependent reliability for a complex component geometry and loading is then predicted. Appropriate design changes are made until an acceptable probability of failure has been reached...|$|R
