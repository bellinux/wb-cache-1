Single-stage hydraulic turbochargers can reduce energy use in AGR processes.

This significantly reduces operating costs for the <b>acid</b> gas <b>removal</b> unit. This paper will present a turbocharger based system that optimizes energy use while simultaneously fulfilling the required controls functionality of the LCV.

One of these chemical solvents is a kind of tertiary amine called MDEA. The main goal of this master thesis is modeling an <b>acid</b> gas <b>removal</b> plant using MDEA. At first, a brief explanation about Natural gas chain in Norwegian continental shelf is given, then a bibliographical research was made regarding <b>acid</b> gas <b>removal</b> processes; in addition, some criteria for selection of proper <b>acid</b> gases <b>removal</b> process are discussed. Asg&# 229;rd B has an offshore absorption unit to remove selective acid gas using FLEXORB- a solvent which is used to remove selectively H 2 S. Another solvent that can be used in the absorption process to remove H 2 S selectively is MDEA. In this project, MDEA is replaced with FLEXORB to observe the solvent behavior from different angles in the Asg&# 229;rd B <b>acid</b> gas <b>removal</b> unit. For this purpose, a simulation of the process has been done in which MDEA was used as a solvent and the obtained results will be discussed. The simulation of this plant is designed based on the data collected from Statoil. Unisim software has been chosen to simulate amine based <b>acid</b> gas <b>removal</b> unit. It has also been tried to optimize the process. To do so, heat exchanger network was designed using Pinch Analysis method and the required external energy has been calculated. It helps to use heat flows of the streams in the process in order not to waste the energy. Finally, it is concluded that required recycled flow rate of MDEA is much more than FLEXORB and consequently, the required make up water for MDEA solvent will be more than required water in the process using FLEXORB. Furthermore, FLEXORB acts more selectively than MDEA in the case of H 2 S removal. Changing different parameters in the simulation shows that (i) inlet lean amine temperature entering the absorber does not affect the absorption process, (ii) increasing of heat duty in the reboiler of regenerator decreases acid gases in the treated gas, (iii) lean amine flow rate with an acceptable loading has a direct effect on the product quality.

The sour gas will flow through the absorption-adsorption column and at the same time, amine solvent flow through that column countercurrently with the gas. Amine solvent flows using the circulation pump at the flowrate 120 L/hr. For parameter MEA/MDEA mixture composition, five different ratios of amine solvents were used in every 10 minutes of experiment.
