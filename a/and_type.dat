5|$|Alveoli {{consist of}} {{two types of}} {{alveolar}} cell and an alveolar macrophage.

Type I cells provide 95% of the surface area of each alveoli and are flat ("squamous"), <b>and</b> <b>Type</b> II cells generally cluster {{in the corners of}} the alveoli and have a cuboidal shape. Despite this, cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 1:1 or 6:4.|$|E

40|$|Background: Reading <b>and</b> <b>typing</b> text {{messages}} while driving seriously impairs driving performance and are prohibited activities in many jurisdictions. Hong Kong is a bilingual society {{and many people}} write in both Chinese and English. As the input methods for text messaging in Chinese and English are considerably different, this study used a driving simulator approach to compare the effects of reading <b>and</b> <b>typing</b> Chinese <b>and</b> English {{text messages}} on driving performance. Method: The driving performances of 26 participants were monitored under the following conditions: (1) no distraction, (2) reading <b>and</b> <b>typing</b> Chinese text messages, and (3) reading <b>and</b> <b>typing</b> English text messages. The following measures of driving performance were collected under all of the conditions: reaction time (RT), driving lane undulation (DLU), driving speed fluctuation (DSF), and car-following distance (CFD) between test and leading cars. Results: RT, DLU, and DSF were significantly impaired by reading <b>and</b> <b>typing</b> both Chinese <b>and</b> English text messages. Moreover, typing text messages distracted drivers more than reading them. Although the Chinese text messaging input system {{is more complicated than}} the English system, the use of Chinese did not cause a significantly different degree of distraction. Conclusion: Both reading <b>and</b> <b>typing</b> text messages while driving should be prohibited regardless of whether Chinese or English is used. postprin...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine if a personality test, The Myers-Briggs <b>Type</b> Indicator (MBTI), <b>and</b> a career decision-making process questionnaire could be used to identify specific personality <b>types,</b> <b>and</b> examine the problems <b>and</b> influences these <b>types</b> have in the career decision-making process. The sample for this study consisted of 33 undeclared/undecided students, 25 females and 8 males, enrolled in the fall 1987 freshman and sophomore classes. Two research questions and 13 hypotheses directed this study. Research question 1 asked, "Can the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator be used to assess career decision-making in undecided students?" Results indicated that two Myers-Briggs <b>types,</b> Feeling <b>and</b> Perceiving, appeared twice as often as other types. Research question 2 asked, "Can the career decision-making process questionnaire be used to assess career decision-making in undecided students?" Results found that Introverted types reported greater indecision and anxiety in career decision-making. Correlations between MBTI <b>types</b> <b>and</b> career influences revealed relationships between: Perceiving <b>types</b> <b>and</b> their interests, Thinking <b>types</b> <b>and</b> faculty members, Judging <b>types</b> <b>and</b> earning a degree, Feeling <b>types</b> <b>and</b> making money.

5|$|After CalabiâYau {{manifolds}} {{had entered}} physics {{as a way}} to compactify extra dimensions, many physicists began studying these manifolds. In the late 1980s, Lance Dixon, Wolfgang Lerche, Cumrun Vafa, and Nick Warner noticed that given such a compactification of string theory, {{it is not possible to}} reconstruct uniquely a corresponding CalabiâYau manifold. Instead, two different versions of string theory called type IIA string theory <b>and</b> <b>type</b> IIB can be compactified on completely different CalabiâYau manifolds giving rise to the same physics. In this situation, the manifolds are called mirror manifolds, and the relationship between the two physical theories is called mirror symmetry.|$|E
