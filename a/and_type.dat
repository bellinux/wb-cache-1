5|$|Alveoli {{consist of}} {{two types of}} {{alveolar}} cell and an alveolar macrophage.

Type I cells provide 95% of the surface area of each alveoli and are flat ("squamous"), <b>and</b> <b>Type</b> II cells generally cluster {{in the corners of}} the alveoli and have a cuboidal shape. Despite this, cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 1:1 or 6:4.|$|E

40|$|Background: Reading <b>and</b> <b>typing</b> text {{messages}} while driving seriously impairs driving performance and are prohibited activities in many jurisdictions. Hong Kong is a bilingual society {{and many people}} write in both Chinese and English. As the input methods for text messaging in Chinese and English are considerably different, this study used a driving simulator approach to compare the effects of reading <b>and</b> <b>typing</b> Chinese <b>and</b> English {{text messages}} on driving performance. Method: The driving performances of 26 participants were monitored under the following conditions: (1) no distraction, (2) reading <b>and</b> <b>typing</b> Chinese text messages, and (3) reading <b>and</b> <b>typing</b> English text messages. The following measures of driving performance were collected under all of the conditions: reaction time (RT), driving lane undulation (DLU), driving speed fluctuation (DSF), and car-following distance (CFD) between test and leading cars. Results: RT, DLU, and DSF were significantly impaired by reading <b>and</b> <b>typing</b> both Chinese <b>and</b> English text messages. Moreover, typing text messages distracted drivers more than reading them. Although the Chinese text messaging input system {{is more complicated than}} the English system, the use of Chinese did not cause a significantly different degree of distraction. Conclusion: Both reading <b>and</b> <b>typing</b> text messages while driving should be prohibited regardless of whether Chinese or English is used. postprin...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine if a personality test, The Myers-Briggs <b>Type</b> Indicator (MBTI), <b>and</b> a career decision-making process questionnaire could be used to identify specific personality <b>types,</b> <b>and</b> examine the problems <b>and</b> influences these <b>types</b> have in the career decision-making process. The sample for this study consisted of 33 undeclared/undecided students, 25 females and 8 males, enrolled in the fall 1987 freshman and sophomore classes. Two research questions and 13 hypotheses directed this study. Research question 1 asked, "Can the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator be used to assess career decision-making in undecided students?" Results indicated that two Myers-Briggs <b>types,</b> Feeling <b>and</b> Perceiving, appeared twice as often as other types. Research question 2 asked, "Can the career decision-making process questionnaire be used to assess career decision-making in undecided students?" Results found that Introverted types reported greater indecision and anxiety in career decision-making. Correlations between MBTI <b>types</b> <b>and</b> career influences revealed relationships between: Perceiving <b>types</b> <b>and</b> their interests, Thinking <b>types</b> <b>and</b> faculty members, Judging <b>types</b> <b>and</b> earning a degree, Feeling <b>types</b> <b>and</b> making money.

5|$|After Calabi–Yau {{manifolds}} {{had entered}} physics {{as a way}} to compactify extra dimensions, many physicists began studying these manifolds. In the late 1980s, Lance Dixon, Wolfgang Lerche, Cumrun Vafa, and Nick Warner noticed that given such a compactification of string theory, {{it is not possible to}} reconstruct uniquely a corresponding Calabi–Yau manifold. Instead, two different versions of string theory called type IIA string theory <b>and</b> <b>type</b> IIB can be compactified on completely different Calabi–Yau manifolds giving rise to the same physics. In this situation, the manifolds are called mirror manifolds, and the relationship between the two physical theories is called mirror symmetry.|$|E
