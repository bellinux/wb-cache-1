40|$|This {{report is}} based on an {{analysis}} of the practicability and the effect of different models for allocating costs of journal and other digital information licences between HEIs where journal collections or other information products have been licensed by a "bloc" of institutions for a single <b>all-in</b> <b>price</b> – the so-called "Big Deal". This type of transaction is contemplated for core resources that have widespread application in HE. It can operate at a national level, or on a regional basis, or for groups of academic libraries with a common interest in a particular discipline. The report draws on two studies: Activities, costs and funding flows in the scholarly communications system in the UK, Research information Network, London, 2008 (referred to as the ‘CEPA Report), and Review of the Costs and Benefits of Single Payment Arrangements for Jisc/NESLi 2 Licences, Jisc Collections, London, 2009, referred to as the ‘Single Payment Report’ Both reports point to the benefits of moving to a digital journal environment in which online-only journal lists are licensed from publishers (and print versions discontinued) and paid for in a single payment transaction and in which significant reductions in library operating costs are achievable...|$|E
40|$|There {{are over}} 20 'components' in an {{international}} door-to-door transportation, ranging from warehousing and distribution, to forwarding, documentation, transportation, customs clearance, etc [...] As tariffs in ocean transportation tend to converge due to competition and service homogenization, carriers, in competition with third party logistics service providers, strive to integrate door-to-door services under their control. In doing so, and among others, they invest heavily in logistics rather than ships that can nowadays be easily chartered in from institutional investors. Integration efforts however have been met {{with varying degrees of}} success in the face of skeptical and suspicious shippers requiring cost break down and more transparency. With the use of game theory, this paper attempts to develop winning service bundling strategies for ocean carriers, i. e. global supply chain solutions under <b>all-in</b> <b>prices.</b> Preliminary results show that, under certain conditions, bundling can be an equilibrium strategy for one or more carriers, and despite leveraging around captive liner services and potentially enhanced profits, bundling does not necessarily lead to a loss in social welfare...|$|R
