5|$|Amanita australis {{mushrooms}} {{that have}} lost their warts and have had the colours faded may resemble <b>another</b> <b>New</b> Zealand species, A.nothofagi. The two species may be distinguished reliably using microscopy—A.nothofagi does not have clamp connections {{at the base of}} the basidia, unlike A.australis.A.australis also bears some resemblance to the eastern North American and east Asian species A.abrupta, which also has an abruptly bulbous stem base.|$|E

5|$|New {{gameplay}} features distinguish Shadow the Hedgehog {{from previous}} Sonic games. For example, Shadow can use guns to combat enemies, adding {{an element of}} third-person shooter gameplay. Parts of the scenery, such as traffic signs, {{can also be used}} as weapons. <b>Another</b> <b>new</b> feature is the ability to drive vehicles, such as motorcycles and alien aircraft. Although Shadow can outrun the game's vehicles, the latter have unique capabilities, such as crushing enemies and traversing otherwise impassible acid-covered areas.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other major}} and {{supporting}} characters from Final Fantasy X {{appear in the}} game.

5|$|A 1990 CDOT design {{proposal}} for a new bridge was dropped after heavy opposition. In 2004 the city of Aspen {{and the town of}} Snowmass jointly funded design work for <b>another</b> <b>new</b> bridge. CDOT expedited the planning process for the bridge and work began the next year. Construction of the segmental concrete box-girder replacement was complicated by the need to protect the wetlands below, a problem that was solved by building the bridge from the top down and taking measures to allow the concrete piers to be poured and dried during winter.|$|E
5|$|After what {{is later}} {{believed}} to have been at least three months, Daniel is finally able to reconstruct the planet's history with the finished translations: the Ancients had attempted to escape a mysterious plague by building a time machine but never got it to work properly. Upon returning to the planet, SG-1 learn of the death of Malikai's wife, whom Malikai wants to visit in the past {{with the help of the}} time machine. O'Neill's experience of his son's death convinces Malikai to shut down the device before yet <b>another</b> <b>new</b> loop can start. Back at the SGC, O'Neill, Carter, and Daniel have their first breakfast after the loops, and O'Neill answers Daniel's question about unusual activities in the loops with a long look at Carter.|$|E

According to Samuel, both the Anes and Lopez households secretly practised Judaism, which was then illegal in England, while outwardly conforming as Anglicans. Other scholars are ambivalent on the matter; Lopez would always insist {{that he was a}} Christian. Roderigo and Sarah had four sons and two daughters, of whom at least the eldest five—Ellyn (Elinor), Ambrose, Douglas, William and Ann—were baptised within the hospital precincts at St Bartholomew-the-Less between 1564 and 1579. Lopez's brother Lewis lived with them in Holborn; a second brother, Diego Lopes Aleman, became a merchant in Antwerp and Venice.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{raising the}} orchestra's profile and helping it return to prosperity, Solti {{considerably}} expanded its repertoire. Under him the Chicago Symphony gave its first cycles of the symphonies of Bruckner and Mahler. He introduced new works commissioned for the orchestra, such as Lutosławski's Third Symphony, and Tippett's Fourth Symphony which {{was dedicated to}} Solti. <b>Another</b> <b>new</b> work was Tippett's Byzantium, an orchestral song-cycle, premiered by Solti and the orchestra with the soprano Faye Robinson. Solti frequently programmed works by American composers, including Charles Ives and Elliott Carter.|$|E
5|$|At the {{expiration}} {{of his term}} as lieutenant governor in 1995, Patton announced his candidacy for governor. The 1995 gubernatorial election was novel in several ways, following a 1992 constitutional amendment. It was the first election in Kentucky history in which the governor and lieutenant governor were elected as a ticket. <b>Another</b> <b>new</b> provision stated that if no candidate received at least 40percent {{of the vote in}} his or her party's primary, a runoff election would occur between the top two candidates. Most significantly, {{for the first time in}} Kentucky history the winners of each race would be allowed to succeed themselves in office and serve another term. Also, as a result of campaign finance reform passed under Governor Jones, candidates would receive public campaign financing and would have their campaign spending capped, negating the advantage of wealthy candidates.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{continued}} {{to defy the}} Senate by next appointing Wheeler Hazard Peckham <b>another</b> <b>New</b> York attorney who had opposed Hill's machine in that state. Hill used all of his influence to block Peckham's confirmation, and on February 16, 1894, the Senate rejected the nomination {{by a vote of}} 32 to 41. Reformers urged Cleveland to continue the fight against Hill and to nominate Frederic R. Coudert, but Cleveland acquiesced in an inoffensive choice, that of Senator Edward Douglass White of Louisiana, whose nomination was accepted unanimously. Later, in 1896, another vacancy on the Court led Cleveland to consider Hornblower again, but he declined to be nominated. Instead, Cleveland nominated Rufus Wheeler Peckham, the brother of Wheeler Hazard Peckham, and the Senate confirmed the second Peckham easily.|$|E
