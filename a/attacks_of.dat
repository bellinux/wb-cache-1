40|$|Abstract. The {{experiences}} were {{performed in the}} Tautii Magheraus locality, located at 3 km from Baia Mare. Five variety of grapevine were studied: Cramposie, Feteasca regala, Muscat Ottonel, Perla de Zala and Italian Riesling. The resistance of the cultivated grapevine varieties against the <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> the main phytopathogenic fungi: Plasmopara viticola, Uncinula necator, Botryotinia fuckeliana, {{in terms of the}} 2011 year, was studied. In order to assess the resistance of the grapevine varieties against the phytopathogenic agents attack, the frequency, intensity and degree <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> were determined. The most sensitive to the <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> downy mildew on leaves was the Italian Riessling, with a degree <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> 71. 5 %; and the most resistant variety was Perla de Zala, with a degree <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> 26 %. The most resistant to the <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> grape powdery mildew on leaves was the Muscat Ottonel variety, with a degree <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> 8. 1 %; and the most sensitive was the Italian Riesling variety with 18. 1 %. In case <b>of</b> the <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> downy mildew on grapes, the most sensitive was the Italian Riesling variety with a degree <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> 11. 5 %; and the most resistant was Perla de Zala with 2. 5 %. During the vegetation of the 2011 year, the chemical protection was performed with fungicides that were administered by seven sprayings...|$|R
50|$|<b>Attack</b> <b>of</b> the 60 Foot Centerfold is a 1995 satirical {{science fiction}} film {{starring}} J.J.

The {{film is a}} parody <b>of</b> <b>Attack</b> <b>of</b> the 50 Foot Woman (1958), but contains much nudity. The film was loosely remade in 2012 as <b>Attack</b> <b>of</b> the 50 Foot Cheerleader.|$|R
5|$|Diuretics {{have been}} {{associated}} with <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> gout. However, a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide does not seem to increase risk. Other medications that increase the risk include niacin, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (except losartan), beta blockers, ritonavir, and pyrazinamide. The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{is a form}} of {{inflammatory}} arthritis characterized by recurrent <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> a red, tender, hot, and swollen joint. Pain typically comes on rapidly in less than twelve hours. The joint {{at the base of the}} big toe is affected in about half of cases. It may also result in tophi, kidney stones, or urate nephropathy.|$|E

5|$|Missouri was {{detached}} from the carrier task force off Okinawa on 5 May and sailed for Ulithi. During the Okinawa campaign she had shot down five enemy planes, assisted {{in the destruction of}} six others, and scored one probable kill.

Her shore bombardment destroyed several gun emplacements and many other military, governmental, and industrial structures.|$|E
5|$|Others {{argue that}} there is no {{available}} evidence that demonstrates that any of these organisms are capable of causing aphthous stomatitis by themselves. Some people with aphthous stomatitis may show herpes virus within the epithelium of the mucosa, but without any productive infection.

However, antiviral medication has no effect on aphthous stomatitis.|$|E

Following his promotion, unit morale improved, and every one of his men re-enlisted.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Wanat {{has been}} {{described}} as one of the bloodiest Taliban <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> the war and one of several attacks on remote outposts. In contrast to previous roadside bombings and haphazard attacks and ambushes, this attack was well-coordinated with fighters from many insurgent groups with an effort that was disciplined and sustained which was able to precisely target key equipment such as a wire-guided missile launcher.|$|E

The only casualties were five civilian workers, injured when a 110-lb bomb landed on their shelter.|$|E

5|$|The brigade repulsed a heavy {{attack on}} the morning of 12 March, but settled into a {{relatively}} static position thereafter. On 9 May, the Garhwal Brigade was used as a second wave in the first <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> the Battle of Aubers Ridge, without success; they saw action again on the night of 15 May, where the leading battalions met heavy resistance and Blackader was forced to call off the attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} was then deployed in defensive operations against massed Soviet attacks. From 26 August to 15 September the division repulsed five <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> divisional strength and a further 85 <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> battalion strength. The heaviest combat occurred on 26 August near Bespalovka and on 28 August, when the division halted a Soviet breakthrough at Bol'shaya Gomol'sha. Fegelein led a counterattack on 8 September, recapturing the height 199,0 at Verkhniy Bishkin. On 11 September 1943, during these defensive battles, {{he was awarded}} the Close Combat Clasp in bronze. Fegelein was severely wounded on 30 September 1943 and was hospitalised for a few weeks. He received the German Cross in gold on 1 November 1943. Following his convalescence he was appointed chief of Amt VI—Office for Rider and Driver Training—in the SS-Führungshauptamt on 1 January 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{perception}} of sharks as dangerous animals has been popularized by publicity {{given to a}} few isolated unprovoked attacks, such as the Jersey Shore shark <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> 1916, and through popular fictional works about shark attacks, such as the Jaws film series. Jaws author Peter Benchley, as well as Jaws director Steven Spielberg later attempted to dispel the image of sharks as man-eating monsters.|$|E

In both cases, solvent cooperation is effective {{in the formation of}} the adducts. The relevance of such a result in relation to the catalytic properties of Ti−zeolites is discussed...|$|R
5|$|Thyrotoxic {{periodic}} paralysis (TPP) is {{a condition}} featuring <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> muscle weakness {{in the presence of}} hyperthyroidism (overactivity of the thyroid gland). Hypokalemia (a decreased potassium level in the blood) is usually present during attacks. The condition may be life-threatening if weakness of the breathing muscles leads to respiratory failure, or if the low potassium levels lead to cardiac arrhythmias (irregularities in the heart rate). If untreated, it is typically recurrent in nature.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{are useful for}} preventing further episodes of gout, including allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid. Long term medications are not recommended until a person has had two <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> gout, unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or urate nephropathy exist. It is not until this point that medications are cost-effective. They are not usually started until one to two weeks after an acute flare has resolved, due to theoretical concerns of worsening the attack. They are often used in combination with either an NSAID or colchicine {{for the first three}} to six months.|$|E
5|$|A {{very small}} {{proportion}} (those affected by SMAD4 (MADH4) mutations, see below) have multiple benign polyps {{in the large}} intestine, which may bleed or transform into colorectal cancer. A similarly small proportion experiences pulmonary hypertension, a state in which the pressure in the lung arteries is increased, exerting pressure {{on the right side}} of the heart and causing peripheral edema (swelling of the legs), fainting and <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> chest pain. It has been observed that the risk of thrombosis (particularly venous thrombosis, in the form of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) may be increased. There is a suspicion that those with HHT may have a mild immunodeficiency and are therefore at a slightly increased risk from infections.|$|E
