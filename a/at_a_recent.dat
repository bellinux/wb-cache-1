5|$|In 2010, Australia had {{its most}} {{successful}} Winter Olympics, ending with two gold and one silver. There were a further seven finishes {{in the top}} ten. Flagbearer Bright returned and won gold. After falling in her first run in the final—only the highest of the two runs is counted—she had to perform her second run before all the other competitors as she was ranked last after the first phase, and produced the top-score; the later competitors could not match her and she took victory. In 2010, Lydia Lassila (née Ierodiaconou) took gold, having come into the event as the reigning World Cup champion and favourite after setting a record score <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> World Cup competition. After being second after the first jump, she scored highly on her final attempt, and the leader Xu Mengtao from China failed to land her second jump cleanly, sealing Lassila's win. Cooper returned for a final campaign and came fifth. Begg-Smith was again the favorite after three consecutive World Cup wins, but he was narrowly beaten by local skier Alexandre Bilodeau.|$|E

Admiral Morrison called Marlett to his office and made it clear how offended {{he was with the}} cartoon. Marlett apologized to the admiral and the offending storyboard was replaced with another idea.

25|$|As Zupaysaurus was {{originally}} described, the head bore two thin parallel crests {{on top of}} the skull, similar to theropods like Dilophosaurus and Coelophysis kayentakatae. These crests are thought to have been formed by the nasal bones solely, unlike those of many other theropods which also incorporated the lacrimal bones. Crests on the skull were pervasive among theropods and may have been used for communicative purposes such as species or gender recognition. However, more recent analysis of the skull has cast doubt on the presence of these crests in Zupaysaurus. An unpublished abstract presented <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> conference indicated the structures initially identified as crests were in fact the lacrimal bones displaced upwards during the process of fossilization. Other cranial ornamentation included a rugose laterally-projecting lacrimal ridge {{on the top of the}} skull.|$|E

25|$|Churchill {{received}} him in trademark fashion: in bed, {{wearing an}} embroidered dressing gown, smoking a cigar. He, Joseph Stalin, and Franklin D. Roosevelt had discussed {{the matter of}} Yugoslavia <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> conference in Teheran, and had decided to give all possible support to the Partisans. This was the turning point. The Chetniks were given a task (a bridge to blow up) and a deadline, to show whether they could still be effective allies; they failed this test and supplies were re-directed from them to the Partisans. The British government was left with the tricky political and moral problem of King Peter and his royalist government in exile. But the main issues were air supplies and air support, and to help co-ordinate this, Maclean's mission was expanded. Some of the new officers included Andrew Maxwell of the Scots Guards, John Clarke of the 2nd Scots Guards, Geoffrey Kup, a gunnery expert, Hilary King, a signals officer, Johnny Tregida, and, for a time, Randolph Churchill. Some of these were SAS or otherwise known from the Western Desert Campaign the previous year.|$|E

A spokesperson for the NWWA said that, although the river had a reputation for being polluted, it was getting much better but still had not reached a state where they would be satisfied. She added that tests were being carried out to show the improved cleanliness of the Irwell and that 600trout had recently been put in the river at Summerseat, near Bury. The proposals were welcomed by both Salford University and Agecroft Rowing Club, with the university stating that they wished to use that section for their boat race. [...] Later that year it was reported that hundreds of trees and shrubs were to be planted {{along the banks of the}} Irwell between Broughton and Pomona Dock in a £650,000 [...] "green finger" [...] scheme to [...] "bring the countryside into the heart of industrial Salford". The dossier outlining the scheme, prepared by Salford's Technical Services Officer, emphasised the [...] "bleak character" [...] of the Irwell Valley with [...] "many constructions by the river that are decaying and rotting" [...] and said [...] "the main problems are caused by an excess of ammonia and a high organic content from sewage effluents which discharge into the water upstream."
