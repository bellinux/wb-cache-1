5|$|At {{the time}} of McCarthy's speech, {{communism}} was a significant concern in the United States. This concern was exacerbated {{by the actions of}} the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe, the victory of the communists in the Chinese Civil War, the Soviets' development of a nuclear weapon the year before, and by the contemporary controversy surrounding Alger Hiss and the confession of Soviet spy Klaus Fuchs. With this background and due to the sensational nature of McCarthy's charge against the State Department, the Wheeling speech soon attracted <b>a</b> <b>flood</b> <b>of</b> press interest in McCarthy's claim.|$|E
5|$|During the Industrial Revolution the Welsh woollen {{industry}} {{was slow to}} mechanize compared to the mills of northern England. When railways reached mid Wales in the 1860s they brought <b>a</b> <b>flood</b> <b>of</b> cheap mass-produced products that destroyed the local industry. However, development of the South Wales Coalfield opened a growing market for woollen products from water-powered mills in the south west, which prospered until after World War I. At one time {{there were more than}} 300 working wool mills. The industry went into steady decline after World War I, and only a few mills continue to operate.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1700s, some European settlers, who were granted {{warrants}} by William Penn, explored Native American trails in the Nescopeck Creek watershed. On these paths, skirmishes occasionally occurred between settlers and Native Americans. One {{example is the}} Sugarloaf Massacre, {{when a group of}} Native Americans ambushed some soldiers on the Lehigh Path near Nescopeck Creek in 1780. The first mill was built in the Nescopeck Creek watershed in 1788. By 1791, there were four settlers along Nescopeck Creek. In 1795, Samuel Mifflin built a sawmill at the mouth of Nescopeck Creek. A gristmill was built on Nescopeck Creek the same year. <b>A</b> <b>flood</b> <b>of</b> Nescopeck Creek in 1786, known as the Pumpkin Flood, was noted for sweeping large numbers of pumpkins downstream on the creek.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 2004, the Cassini–Huygens {{space probe}} {{performed}} the SOI (Saturn Orbit Insertion) maneuver and entered orbit around Saturn. Before the SOI, Cassini had already studied the system extensively. In June 2004, it had conducted a close flyby of Phoebe, sending back high-resolution images and data. Cassini flyby of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, has captured radar images of large lakes and their coastlines with numerous islands and mountains. The orbiter completed two Titan flybys before releasing the Huygens probe on 25 December 2004. Huygens descended {{onto the surface}} of Titan on 14 January 2005, sending <b>a</b> <b>flood</b> <b>of</b> data during the atmospheric descent and after the landing. Cassini has since conducted multiple flybys of Titan and other icy satellites.|$|E
5|$|The final trigger, however, was the {{discovery}} of gold elsewhere in Canada and Alaska, prompting a new stampede, this {{time away from the}} Klondike. In August 1898, gold had been found at Atlin Lake {{at the head of the}} Yukon River, generating a flurry of interest, but during the winter of 1898–99 much larger quantities were found at Nome at the mouth of the Yukon. In 1899, <b>a</b> <b>flood</b> <b>of</b> prospectors from across the region left for Nome, 8,000 from Dawson alone during a single week in August. The Klondike gold rush was over.|$|E

5|$|Brasenose was {{a smaller}} {{community}} during the war, but it kept going. Once again, union with Lincoln College was discussed: {{but in other}} areas, temporary merger was more appropriate; thus, Brasenose and Christ Church fielded single sports teams. The College hosted military personnel {{as it had in}} the First World War; a Nissen hut was even set up in Deer Park. Brasenose sent <b>a</b> <b>flood</b> <b>of</b> undergraduates into the forces; in particular, the college's sporting, masculine ethos meant many joined the Royal Air Force. This would contribute significantly to a high death total– 123 for the Allies and 1 for the Germans– more than in the First World War, although proportionately less. Many of Brasenose's sporting heroes died; among survivors were future Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie and cricketer Pieter van der Bijl.|$|E
5|$|Henry VII {{made more}} use of Windsor. In 1488, shortly after {{succeeding}} to the throne, {{he held a}} massive feast for the Order of the Garter at the castle. He completed the roof of St George's Chapel, and set about converting the older eastern Lady Chapel into a proposed shrine to Henry VI, whose canonisation was then considered imminent. In the event, Henry VI was not canonised and the project was abandoned, although the shrine continued to attract <b>a</b> <b>flood</b> <b>of</b> pilgrims. Henry VII appears to have remodelled the King's Chamber in the palace, and had {{the roof of the}} Great Kitchen rebuilt in 1489. He also built a three-storied tower on the west end of the palace, which he used for his personal apartments. Windsor began to be used for international diplomatic events, including the grand visit of Philip I of Castile in 1506. William de la Pole, one of the surviving Yorkist claimants to the throne, was imprisoned at Windsor Castle during Henry's reign, before his execution in 1513.|$|E
5|$|In 1341, the once-mighty Byzantine Empire {{was in a}} {{state of}} turmoil. Despite the {{restoration}} of the Empire's capital to Constantinople and the recovery of a measure of its former power by Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282), the policies implemented during his reign had exhausted the state's resources, and the Empire's strength waned under his successor, Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328). During Andronikos II's long reign, the remaining Byzantine possessions in Asia Minor slowly fell to the advancing Turks, most notably the newly established Ottoman emirate. This caused <b>a</b> <b>flood</b> <b>of</b> refugees into Byzantium's European provinces, while at the same time the Catalan Company wrought havoc in the imperial domains. Taxes also rose dramatically to finance tributes to the Empire's enemies. A combination of these failures and personal ambition moved the Emperor's grandson and heir, the young Andronikos III Palaiologos, to revolt. Supported by a group of young aristocrats led by John Kantakouzenos and Syrgiannes Palaiologos, Andronikos III deposed his grandfather after a series of conflicts during the 1320s. Although successful in removing the old Emperor from power, the war did not augur well for the future, as the Empire's neighbours—the Serbs, Bulgarians, Turks, Genoese and Venetians—took advantage of Byzantine infighting to gain territory or expand their influence within the Empire.|$|E

5|$|In 1926, WWV {{was nearly}} shut down. Its signal could only cover {{the eastern half}} of the United States, and other {{stations}} located in Minneapolis and at Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were slowly making WWV redundant. The station's impending shutdown was announced in 1926, but it was saved by <b>a</b> <b>flood</b> <b>of</b> protests from citizens who relied on the service. Later, in 1931, WWV underwent an upgrade. Its transmitter, now directly controlled by a quartz oscillator, was moved to College Park, Maryland. Broadcasts began on 5MHz. A year later, the station was moved again, to Department of Agriculture land in Beltsville, Maryland. Broadcasts were added on 10 and 15MHz, power was increased, and time signals, an A440 tone, and ionosphere reports were all added to the broadcast in June 1937.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, in {{collaboration}} with numerous companies, Microsoft created a home computer system, MSX, which contained {{its own version of}} the DOS operating system, called MSX-DOS; this became relatively popular in Japan, Europe and South America. Later, the market saw <b>a</b> <b>flood</b> <b>of</b> IBM PC clones after Columbia Data Products successfully cloned the IBM BIOS, quickly followed by Eagle Computer and Compaq. The deal with IBM allowed Microsoft to have control of its own QDOS derivative, MS-DOS, and through aggressive marketing of the operating system to manufacturers of IBM-PC clones Microsoft rose from a small player to one of the major software vendors in the home computer industry. With the release of the Microsoft Mouse on May 2, 1983, Microsoft continued to expand its product line in other markets. This expansion included Microsoft Press, a book publishing division, on July 11 the same year, which debuted with two titles: Exploring the IBM PCjr Home Computer by Peter Norton, and The Apple Macintosh Book by Cary Lu.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} many small Scottish islands, Papa Stour's {{population}} peaked in the 19th century and {{has experienced a}} significant decline since then (see e.g. Mingulay). By 1970 the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen 'fairly elderly' residents, but an advertisement in Exchange and Mart reversed the decline. A croft and five sheep were offered free of charge to incomers which brought <b>a</b> <b>flood</b> <b>of</b> applicants. By 1981 the census recorded a population of 33. However, by 2005 the population had fallen to 20 after serious discord between islanders led to several court cases. A number of people left the island and the school closed. By early 2008 the population had dropped to just nine after a family of seven left. The 2011 census recorded a usually resident population of 15 - during the decade 2011-11 Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.|$|E
