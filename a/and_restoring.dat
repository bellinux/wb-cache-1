40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} dental bleaching on the shear bond strength of enamel. Methods: Fifty molars were selected and divided into five groups (n= 10); G 1 -without bleaching (control); G 2 -bleached with 10 % carbamide peroxide <b>and</b> <b>restored</b> 24 h later; G 3 -bleached with 10 % carbamide peroxide <b>and</b> <b>restored</b> seven days later; G 4 -bleached with 35 % hydrogen peroxide <b>and</b> <b>restored</b> a 35 % <b>and</b> <b>restored</b> 24 h later; G 5 -bleached with 35 % hydrogen peroxide <b>and</b> <b>restored</b> a 35 % <b>and</b> <b>restored</b> seven days later. During the 24 h and 7 -day intervals the test specimens remained stored in artificial saliva, after which the restorative procedures were performed on the enamel. Results: The microshear bond strength test indicated the following results in MPa (ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc) : G 1 - 43. 15 a (± 5. 19); G 2 - 31. 34 ab (± 4. 41); G 3 - 36. 66 ab (± 3. 11); G 4 - 22. 87 c (± 3. 76) and G 5 - 35. 67 ab (± 4. 64). Conclusion: Groups G 1, G 2, G 3 and G 5 showed no statistical difference and Group G 4 (bleached with 35 % hydrogen peroxide <b>and</b> <b>restored</b> 24 h later) showed diminished bond strength between the bleached enamel and resin composite...|$|R

5|$|In 1607, {{after the}} death of Leonard Fryer, Peake was {{appointed}} serjeant-painter to King James I, sharing the office with John De Critz, who had held the post since 1603.
