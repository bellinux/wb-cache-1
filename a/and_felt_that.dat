5|$|During the 1970s, Loxton {{also became}} more disillusioned with cricket, as player {{behaviour}} deteriorated and incidences of verbal hostility and altercations increased. The former all-rounder {{was known for}} his vigorous advocacy of the more sedate and gentlemanly conduct that existed during his playing days <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> he and his fellow administrators were losing control of the sport.|$|E

The label went defunct in June 2004.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder's {{abduction}} was {{devised by}} Chris Carter {{towards the end}} of seventh season as a way of allowing the actor to leave the series.

5|$|The Enterprises {{chief medical}} officer and {{a close friend of}} Kirk and Spock. Kelley was {{dissatisfied}} with an earlier version of the script to the point that he considered not taking part. Kelley noted his character spoke many of the film's lighter lines, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> this role was essential in bringing a lighter side to the onscreen drama.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} created by Shu Takumi, who wrote and {{directed}} the first three games. The first game was conceived in 2000 when Takumi's boss at the time, Shinji Mikami, gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted to; Takumi had originally joined Capcom wanting to make mystery and adventure games, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> {{this was a big}} chance for him to make a mark as a creator. The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play. It was originally going to be a detective game, with Phoenix being a private investigator, but at one point Takumi realized that finding and taking apart contradictions was not related to detective work, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the main setting of the game should be courtrooms.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} {{was created to}} {{accompany}} the song featuring Gaga. It portrayed her and Knowles {{in a number of}} costumes, brandishing colorful guns towards men and paying homage to the film Reservoir Dogs and pinup legend Bettie Page.

However, they complimented the costumes and the cinematic homage of the video. The video {{went on to win the}} BET award for Video of the Year.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} as {{archbishop}} there was a dispute with the monks of Christ Church Priory in Canterbury, who resented Baldwin's attempts to impose stricter control over them and disputed the legitimacy of Baldwin's election.

5|$|Heisman {{challenged}} Pop Warner's undefeated Pittsburgh team to {{a decisive}} national championship game, but he declined. In the next season of 1918, Tech lost a lopsided game to Pitt 320.

By 1919, Heisman had divorced his wife <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> he would embarrass his wife socially if he remained in Atlanta. Heisman moved to Pennsylvania, leaving Tech {{in the hands of}} William Alexander.|$|E
5|$|His socialist {{activism}} monopolised his time, {{forcing him}} to abandon a translation of the Persian Shahnameh. It also led to him seeing far less of Burne-Jones, {{with whom he had}} strong political differences; although once a republican, Burne-Jones had become increasingly conservative, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the DF were exploiting Morris for his talents and influence. While Morris devoted much time to trying to convert his friends to the cause, of Morris' circle of artistic comrades, only Webb and Faulkner fully embraced socialism, while Swinburne expressed his sympathy with it.|$|E

5|$|In April 1956, Marshall led a {{delegation}} to London to negotiate for complete self-rule in the Merdeka Talks, but the talks failed when the British {{were reluctant to}} give up control over Singapore's internal security. The British were concerned about communist influence and labour strikes which were undermining Singapore's economic stability, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the local government was ineffective in handling earlier riots. Marshall resigned following {{the failure of the}} talk.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} full season with Lewes, Wormull was used {{in a number of}} {{different}} positions, but in 2007â€“08, he usually played in central midfield, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the continuity helped his performance. He scored the winning goal against Sutton United in the third qualifying round of the FA Cup, and made an assist for one goal and was involved in the second in the fourth qualifying round, to take the club through to the first round proper for the second year running. Wormull contributed five goals from midfield towards his club winning the Conference South title, though an injured ankle meant he missed the last few weeks of the season.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, OPEC {{lost its}} two newest members, {{who had joined}} in the mid-1970s. Ecuador withdrew in December 1992, because it was unwilling to pay the annual US$2million {{membership}} fee <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it needed to produce more oil than it was allowed under the OPEC quota, although it rejoined in October 2007. Similar concerns prompted Gabon to suspend membership in January 1995; it rejoined in July 2016. Iraq has remained a member of OPEC since the organization's founding, but Iraqi production was {{not a part of}} OPEC quota agreements from 1998 to 2016, due to the country's daunting political difficulties.|$|E

5|$|Jagannadh {{expressed}} interest in making a sequel of the film after {{the response to the}} original on its first day and planned to begin work on the same from late 2012. Mahesh too confirmed the same in late January 2012 during the scripting stage of the sequel titled Businessman 2. It was planned as a bilingual film to be shot in Telugu and Hindi simultaneously. Ram Gopal Varma also {{expressed interest}} after listening to the script <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the sequel would do much better business that the original. However, Jagannadh shelved the sequel in early August 2012 and opted to direct Mahesh in an original film.|$|E
5|$|Jon Favreau, the writer, {{director}} and star of Chef, wrote the film's script {{in about two}} weeks. He had long {{wanted to make a}} film about food and chefs, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the subject was suited to a small-scale independent film rather than a big-budget production. He cited Jiro Dreams of Sushi, Eat Drink Man Woman and Big Night as inspirations for creating a food-centric film.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Del Arco had {{no concept}} of what a Borg was prior to the audition. He {{received}} his script on the evening prior to meeting with the producers <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> {{it gave him a}} decent sense of the character. Instead, Del Arco later explained that he was deliberately anti-social towards the other actors at the audition in order to get into Hugh's mindset. When he performed for the producers, someone else read the lines assigned to Picard and La Forge, and he felt like he immediately got a positive result. He received a call back, and returned to audition once more.|$|E

5|$|Morton {{interviewed about}} 70 {{people who had}} known Madonna since her youth. He had {{to spend a lot}} of evenings in bars and clubs in New York chatting to peopleâ€”including artists, musicians, and directorsâ€”who had an {{interesting}} perspective on Madonna and the world. After its release, Madonna received mixed reviews from contemporary critics, who pointed out Morton's poor writing skills <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the book did not present anything new about the singer. The book was a commercial disappointment. In the United States, the book reached eight on The New York Times Best Seller list, and sold half of its initial print.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} seven people, and took ten months to make. It was directed by Shu Takumi and produced by Atsushi Inaba, with music by Masakazu Sugimori, character design by Kumiko Suekane, and art by Tatsuro Iwamoto. In 2000, after Takumi had finished his work on Dino Crisis 2, his boss at the time, Shinji Mikami, gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted to.
