5|$|Hepatitis: During the 1940s the cause, {{method of}} {{communication}} and treatment of infectious hepatitis was not well understood. Experimentation began with COs working at psychiatric hospitals and was expanded to a major research project with 30 to 60 test subjects at the University of Pennsylvania and Yale University. The men were inoculated with infected blood plasma, swallowed nose and throat washings and the human body wastes of infected patients, <b>and</b> <b>drank</b> contaminated water.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{literature}} {{focuses on}} the dining habits of the upper classes, for whom the evening meal (cena) had important social functions.

By the late Republic, if not earlier, women dined, reclined, <b>and</b> <b>drank</b> wine along with men.|$|E

Inferring that Spike bit <b>and</b> <b>drank</b> from Anya, Xander pummels him ferociously until Anya wakes and stops him; excited that he fought to defend her, Anya gestures that they should go have sex.|$|E

5|$|An oral legend {{tells how}} the goddess Prachanda-Chandika {{appeared}} {{to aid the}} gods in the god-demon war, when the gods prayed to the Great Goddess Mahashakti.

The name Prachanda-Chandika also appears as a synonym of Chhinnamasta in her hundred-name hymn in the Shakta Pramoda (19th century). Another oral legend relates her to the Samudra manthan (Churning of the Ocean) episode, where the gods and demons churned the milk ocean to acquire the amrita (the elixir of immortality). Chhinnamasta drank the demons' share of the elixir and then beheaded herself {{to prevent them from}} acquiring it.|$|E

Napolitano specifically remembered the first home game of Wilson's senior year, which happened shortly after his father's death. No fewer than 29 professional scouts, all with radar guns, showed up to see him pitch. According to Napolitano, Wilson was completely oblivious to their appearance; he ate <b>and</b> <b>drank</b> in the dugout, warmed up, and pitched a two-hitter while apparently not noticing that scouts were there. The Cleveland Indians offered him a contract straight out of high school, {{but he did not}} sign, opting to attend college instead.|$|E

40|$|This {{essay is}} {{a survey of}} the field of food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> history in Australia since the 1970 s. It {{discusses}} the range of research and picks out key historiographic aspects: the search for an Australian cuisine; regional food cultures; connection between sources and historical interpretation; and the interdisciplinarity of food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> history. It suggests that as food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> histories have broadened beyond a search for culinary traditions and a gastronomic sensibility, so our understanding of food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> in Australian history has deepened. It also argues that food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> history is more than textual knowledge in books and articles: television programs and exhibitions held in museums and libraries, for example, have enhanced our understanding of food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> histories...|$|R

5|$|The ancient chronicles mention {{two tests}} that Dutthagamani planned {{to find out}} these warriors' skill before the battle. For the first test, Dutthagamani asked the warriors to drink a large {{cauldron}} of toddy, intending to test their strength. When all others refused, Suranimala stepped forward <b>and</b> <b>drank</b> the entire cauldron without any effort. The second test was to test Nandimithra, {{the commander of the}} army. Dutthagamani had his royal elephant, Kandula, infuriated and set on Nandimithra. However, the warrior stood his ground and taking the elephant by its tusks, pushed it to the ground. Thus clearing all doubts as to the abilities and skill of his warriors, Dutthagamani sounded the war drums and raising his flags, started the assault to take Vijithapura.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh {{suffered}} from psychotic episodes and delusions {{and though he}} worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical health, did not eat properly <b>and</b> <b>drank</b> heavily. His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor, when in a rage, he severed part of his own left ear. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at Saint-Rémy. After he discharged himself {{and moved to the}} Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris, he came under the care of the homoeopathic doctor Paul Gachet. His depression continued and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a revolver. He died from his injuries two days later.|$|E

She was admired for her fashion sense, having imported all of her clothing from Paris. Charlotte also smoked <b>and</b> <b>drank,</b> and was liked by many for hosting entertaining parties. She earned a reputation as a gossip, and many found her acid-tongued; she was known for befriending someone and earning their confidence, only to spread their secrets to others.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{literature}} has highlighted {{the link between}} unhealthy food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> consumption with chronic illness such as obesity and diabetes. 1 However, unhealthy food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> sponsorship in sport is common.

40|$|Abstract Background Overweight {{and obesity}} are {{recognised}} {{nationally and internationally}} as key public health challenges. Food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> advertising {{is one of the}} array of factors that influence both diet and physical activity choices and, hence, body weight and obesity. Little previous work has focused on food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> advertising in magazines. We studied food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> advertising {{in a wide range of}} popular UK monthly women's magazines published over a full year. We explored differences in the prevalence of food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> advertising <b>and</b> the type of food <b>and</b> <b>drinks</b> advertised according to season, magazine type and socio-economic profile of readers. Methods All advertisements in all issues of 18 popular UK monthly women's magazines published over 12 months were identified. For each food or drink advertisement, branded food <b>and</b> <b>drinks</b> were noted <b>and</b> categorised into one of seven food groups. All analyses were at the level of the individual advertisement. Results A total of 35 053 advertisements were identified; 1380 (3. 9 %) of these were for food or drink. The most common food group represented was 'food <b>and</b> <b>drinks</b> high in fat and/or sugar' (28. 0 % of food advertisements), the least common group was 'fruits & vegetables' (2. 0 % of food advertisements). Advertisements for alcohol accounted for 10. 1 % of all food advertisements. Food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> advertisements were most common in summer, general interest magazines, and those with the most affluent readerships. There were some differences in the type of food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> advertised across season, magazine type and socio-economic profile of readers. Conclusions Food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> advertisements represented only a small proportion of advertisements in UK women's monthly magazines. Food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> advertisements in these magazines feature a high proportion of 'less healthy' foods. There were a number of differences across season, magazine type and according to the socio-economic profile of readers in the prevalence of food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> advertisements. Fewer differences were seen in the type of food <b>and</b> <b>drinks</b> advertised. </p...|$|R
40|$|Several decades ago, food <b>and</b> <b>drinks</b> were {{disallowed}} in most Japanese libraries. However, as {{discussions of}} “Library as a Place” {{have increased in}} recent years, the number of public and university libraries that have relaxed their policies to allow food <b>and</b> <b>drinks</b> have been increasing. This study focused on the opinions of library users on allowing food <b>and</b> <b>drinks</b> in public libraries and conducted a questionnaire survey among users of nine Japanese libraries. The results indicated that many users favored allowing food <b>and</b> <b>drinks</b> in libraries. Furthermore, {{it was found that}} users tend to frequently visit and stay longer in libraries where food <b>and</b> <b>drinks</b> are allowed...|$|R
5|$|Burnham {{would not}} smoke and seldom drank alcohol, fearing these habits would injure the acuteness of {{his sense of}} smell. He found ways to train himself in mental patience, took power naps instead of indulging in periods of long sleep, <b>and</b> <b>drank</b> very little liquid. He trained himself to accept these abstinences in order to endure the most appalling fatigues, hunger, thirst, and wounds, so that when {{scouting}} or traveling {{where there was no}} water, he might still be able to exist. On more than one occasion he survived in environments where others would have died, or were in fact dying, of exhaustion. He was quiet-mannered and courteous, according to contemporaries. Their reports describe a man who was neither shy nor self-conscious, who was extremely modest, and who seldom spoke of his many adventures.|$|E
5|$|Courville and Percy {{decided to}} test Tarrare's {{capacity}} for food. A meal {{had been prepared}} for 15 labourers near the hospital gates; although generally hospital staff restrained Tarrare {{in the presence of}} food, on this occasion Courville allowed him to reach the table undisturbed. Tarrare ate the entire meal of two large meat pies, plates of grease and salt and four gallons of milk, and then immediately fell asleep; Courville noted that Tarrare's belly became taut and inflated like a large balloon. On another occasion Tarrare was presented with a live cat. He tore the cat's abdomen open with his teeth <b>and</b> <b>drank</b> its blood, and proceeded to eat the entire cat aside from its bones, before vomiting up its fur and skin. Following this, hospital staff offered Tarrare a variety of other animals including snakes, lizards and puppies, all of which were eaten; he also swallowed an entire eel without chewing, having first crushed its head with his teeth.|$|E
5|$|Disillusioned with Covent Garden, MacMillan {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} the Deutsche Oper in Berlin to run its ballet company. Parry describes this as an unhappy experience. Though at Covent Garden Webster may sometimes have been suspected of favouring the opera {{at the expense of}} the ballet, MacMillan discovered that at the Berlin house there was no doubt that the ballet was given distinctly lower priority. He did not speak German, which reduced his enjoyment from watching films (of which he was a great devotee) and theatre and limited him generally in everyday life. Although he had taken several colleagues with him, including Seymour, many moved away over the course of his nearly four years in charge, and MacMillan became increasingly isolated. It was the first time he had been in a managerial as well as a creative role, and the strain affected his physical and mental health. He smoked <b>and</b> <b>drank</b> heavily and suffered a minor stroke.|$|E

5|$|Pottier {{also won}} the fourth stage. In the fifth stage, he was leading by one hour at the halfway point. A cycling legend says {{that he decided to}} stop, entered a bar and ordered a bottle of wine, <b>and</b> <b>drank</b> it almost completely. When he saw the first other cyclists passing by, Pottier mounted his bicycle again, went after them, and won the stage. By this point, Pottier was leading the overall {{classification}} firmly. The winner of the 1905 Tour de France, Louis Trousselier, had had a bad first half of the Tour, and was many points behind. Trousselier rediscovered his form {{in the second half of}} the race, won the 7th, 9th, 10th and 11th stages, and was challenging the second place of Georges Passerieu. Passerieu defended his position by winning the 12th stage. In the last stage, Pottier showed his strength by winning the stage, after finishing together in Paris with Passerieu.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{their return}} on Oct 24, 1871, Hall {{suddenly}} fell ill after drinking {{a cup of}} coffee. His symptoms started with an upset stomach, then progressed to vomiting and delirium the following day. Hall accused several of the ship's company, including Bessels, of having poisoned him. Following these accusations, he refused medical treatment from Bessels, <b>and</b> <b>drank</b> only liquids delivered directly by his Inuit friend Tookoolito. He seemed to improve for a few days, and was even able to go up on deck. Bessels had prevailed upon Bryan, the ship's chaplain, to convince Hall to allow the doctor to see him. By November 4, Hall relented, and Bessels resumed treatment. Shortly after, Hall's condition began to deteriorate, and he suffered vomiting and delirium, and collapsed. Bessels diagnosed apoplexy, and Hall finally died on November 8. He was taken ashore and given a formal burial.|$|E
5|$|A {{rapprochement}} {{between the}} two men was achieved in the winter of 1384, when Carrouges and Le Gris were both invited to the estate of a mutual friend, Jean Crespin, to celebrate the birth of his son. For the first time, Carrouges brought his wife Marguerite into society and it was at this party that she made her first acquaintance with Le Gris. Despite the tension between them, Carrouges and Le Gris shook hands <b>and</b> <b>drank</b> together, putting their quarrel behind them before their peers and neighbours. A few months later Jean de Carrouges departed on campaign to Scotland and Le Gris took the opportunity to increase his influence with the Count, making substantial financial and territorial gains in the his rival's absence. Carrouges returned a year later, now a knight but bankrupt, ill and suffering the aftermath of a long and unsuccessful campaign. When Carrouges appeared at Argentan in January 1386 he was involved in a confrontation with his erstwhile friend. Although it is not known what was said, the two men separated on poor terms and Carrouges departed for Paris in a state of agitation.|$|E

5|$|While {{food was}} {{extremely}} {{hard to come}} by, an even more pressing need was obtaining drinking water. Thirst {{and the search for}} water are mentioned in most of the Robinsons' memoirs. The most common sources originally included toilet cisterns, boilers, and standing water found inside bathtubs. As these ran out, those in hiding were forced to risk sneaking access to wells, which were often guarded by German soldiers. Some memoirs describe long periods observing a particular well and waiting for a chance to obtain a quick drink. Another method involved obtaining polluted sewer water from the canals, and then filtering it through coals wrapped in rags. Generally, records indicate that whatever scant water supplies existed were shared fairly among individuals hiding as a group. In at least one instance, one person was unable to withstand the thirst <b>and</b> <b>drank</b> the whole group's water supply. As a result, Jakub Wiśnia, a former Gęsiówka inmate and after its liberation, a Home Army soldier, was court-martialed by his fellow group members and sentenced to death. The execution was to be postponed until after liberation, but when that occurred, the Robinsons were so overwhelmed with joy, the crime was forgiven and the sentence was never mentioned again.|$|E
