5|$|In 2009, the CRS {{proposed}} four options: Option 1 was {{to continue}} the VH-71 program with Increment I and II versions; the <b>additional</b> <b>cost</b> was estimated at $10billion and the entry into service date was 2019. Option 2 was to restructure the program to provide 23 Increment I aircraft; at an <b>additional</b> <b>cost</b> of $6.4billion and would be operational by 2012. Option 3 was a restructure to provide 19 Increment I aircraft to replace the current fleet; the <b>additional</b> <b>cost</b> for this option was estimated at $5.6billion and the entry into service by 2012. The last option was to upgrade and extend life of current fleet {{at a cost of}} $1.4billion; however this would not meet the standards required for future presidential helicopters, and would require replacement sooner.|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} also {{available}} electronically at: [URL] {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the additional needs and associated financial costs of disability from the perspective of disabled people themselves. The research took place at a time when it is recognised that disabled people have a range of <b>additional</b> needs and <b>costs</b> (Large, 1991) and have a disproportionate risk of poverty (Gordon, et al., 2000). However, research to date has not provided a clear measure of these <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> (Berthoud, 1998). As a result, levels of nationally provided financial benefits and local services are predicated on limited evidence. Certain state benefits are meant to offset, at least partially, the <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> associated with disability, but the extent to which these benefits meet <b>additional</b> needs and <b>costs</b> is unknown. Recently, ‘fairer charging’ policies for local authority domiciliary care have been introduced with the intention that service charges should take into account the <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> that individuals incur because of disability. Clear guidance for determining these <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> is proving elusive. The central aim of this research was to provide clear evidence on the extent of these <b>additional</b> <b>costs...</b>|$|R

5|$|In June 2016, the {{estimated}} cost of the one-stop SSE was revised from $2 billion to $2.9 billion because tunnels need to be deeper than expected in some places, with the new terminal station being 45 to 90 per cent deeper. An <b>additional</b> <b>cost</b> factor is that a high water table would require more concrete. There is also a $300 million maintenance cost to keep Line 3 Scarborough operating until the SSE's opening {{resulting in a total}} project cost of $3.2 billion.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{study by}} the Electric Power Research Institute {{published}} in June 2013, the total cost of ownership of the 2013 Nissan Leaf SV is substantially lower than that of comparable conventional and hybrid vehicles. For comparison, the study constructed average hybrid and conventional vehicles and assumed an average US distance per trip distribution. The study took into account the manufacturer's suggested retail price, taxes, credits, destination charge, electric charging station, fuel cost, maintenance cost, and <b>additional</b> <b>cost</b> due to the use of a gasoline vehicle for trips beyond the range of the Leaf.|$|E
5|$|In April 1958, Eisenhower asked Congress for {{legislation}} {{to overhaul the}} Department of Defense. Over a decade had passed since the legislation which had established it, and {{he was concerned about}} the degree of inter-service rivalry, duplication and mismanagement that was evident in many programs. In ballistic missile development, the Soviet Sputnik program had demonstrated that country's technological lead over the United States. The Army and Air Force had rival programs, PGM-19 Jupiter and PGM-17 Thor respectively, and the <b>additional</b> <b>cost</b> to the taxpayers of developing two systems instead of one was estimated at $500million.|$|E

40|$|When in employment, after-tax income must {{be spent}} on childcare, {{required}} clothing and transport for example. These <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> {{must be taken into}} account when analysing the motivation to work as not to do so could underestimate the incentives to take-up paid employment. Using data from the Irish Household Budget Survey, this paper takes a two-stage logit model and Hausman selection model to control for selection effects to estimate the <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> an employed CES faces compared to an unemployed CES. The main finding is that the <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> of working are highly significant at nearly 2 ̆ 0 ac 7000 per year without children; increasing to nearly 2 ̆ 0 ac 9000 per year with one child under the age of five. These substantial <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> seriously hamper work incentives as it is shown that there is a 25 -fold increase (without young children) in the number of individuals who have a higher income when unemployed than when in employment with the inclusion of these <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> of working...|$|R

5|$|In June 2002, the Tukwila City Council {{rejected}} a {{memorandum of agreement}} with Sound Transit that would have expedited processing of light rail permits issued by the city. Although the city council supported the Tukwila Freeway Route in 2001, the lack of service to Southcenter drove the rejection despite lobbying from elected officials in other cities. Despite fears that Tukwila's decision would jeopardize federal funding for the project, Sound Transit was granted its application for a $500 million commitment from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) later that month. The city council approved expedited permitting in 2004 after requesting Sound Transit increase the parking capacity at the future South 154th Street station and park and ride to 600 stalls, at an <b>additional</b> <b>cost</b> of $5 million.|$|E

Players who pre-ordered the game at selected retailers were able to have their games upgraded to the Premium Edition at no <b>additional</b> <b>cost.</b> The Premium Edition grants players additional advantages in the multiplayer segment of the game, including an experience points boost and early access to the Officer class. A multiplayer beta for selected applicants on the Xbox 360 platform was held in 2010.

5|$|On July 11, 2016, the MassDOT Board {{approved}} {{spending an}} additional $19 million {{to finish the}} station {{by the end of}} September, bringing the total cost of the extension to $93.3 million. The <b>additional</b> <b>cost</b> included replacement for several Pan Am Southern-owned bridges which were in poorer shape than originally thought, and night and weekend work to speed completion. Service to the station had to begin by September 30, or the state risked a revocation of the $59.2 million in federal funds. Limited service began on September 30, 2016, with two weekday round trips; full service began with the schedule change on November 21, 2016.|$|E

5|$|The {{absence of}} {{distinct}} currencies also theoretically removes exchange rate risks, although {{the imposition of}} transfer restrictions in 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis means {{that the situation is}} not quite so simple. The risk of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies or individuals that invest or trade outside their own currency zones. Companies that hedge against this risk will no longer need to shoulder this <b>additional</b> <b>cost.</b> This is particularly important for countries whose currencies had traditionally fluctuated a great deal, particularly the Mediterranean nations.|$|E
5|$|The combat data {{system was}} {{procured}} separately to the submarine design; 14 companies {{were identified as}} capable of providing what the RAN wanted, from which eight were approached in January 1983 with a separate request for tender. Five responded: a consortium led by Rockwell International of the United States, Plessey of the United Kingdom, Signaal of the Netherlands, Sintra Alcatel of France, and a collaboration between the German Krupp Atlas Elektronik and the British Ferranti. Each tender was required to offer a system with a distributed architecture, {{despite the absence of}} an accepted definition for 'distributed computing' at that time, and had to show the cost of programming the software in Ada, although they could offer <b>additional</b> <b>cost</b> breakdowns for other programming languages.|$|E
5|$|The monarchy was {{restored}} after Cromwell's death, {{and for the}} coronation of King CharlesII, who {{had been living in}} exile abroad, new Jewels were made based on records of the lost items. They were supplied by the banker and Royal Goldsmith, SirRobert Vyner, at a cost of £12,184– as much as three warships. A medieval anointing spoon and three swords had survived and were returned to the Crown, as were some historically important gemstones.

5|$|On 30 June 2011, Edinburgh Council {{voted to}} {{continue}} the line between Edinburgh Airport and St Andrew Square. Costs rose to an estimated £770m, leaving the council with a shortfall of more than £200m. The option to scrap the project was considered, but rejected. On 25 August 2011, the council voted to cut the line to run between the airport and Haymarket, reducing the expected cost to £715m. A week later, after the Scottish Government threatened to withhold £72 million of funding, the council reversed its decision, restoring the terminus at St Andrew Square. On 29 November 2011 {{it was announced that}} the eastern terminus would be at York Place instead of St Andrew Square; the intention had been to build the tracks to a reversing point at York Place (without a stop for passengers). Extending passenger services from St Andrew Square to York Place would enable Broughton Street, Picardy Place and the surrounding area to be better served at comparatively little <b>additional</b> <b>cost.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{restoration}} {{then was}} carried out between 1907 and 1911, using the principles of anastylosis and led by Theodor van Erp. The first seven months of restoration were occupied with excavating the grounds around the monument to find missing Buddha heads and panel stones. Van Erp dismantled and rebuilt the upper three circular platforms and stupas. Along the way, Van Erp discovered more things {{he could do to}} improve the monument; he submitted another proposal, which was approved with the <b>additional</b> <b>cost</b> of 34,600 guilders. At first glance, Borobudur had been restored to its old glory. Van Erp went further by carefully reconstructing the chhatra (three-tiered parasol) pinnacle on top of the main stupa. However, he later dismantled the chhatra, citing that there were not enough original stones used in reconstructing the pinnacle, which means that the original design of Borobudur's pinnacle is actually unknown. The dismantled chhatra now is stored in Karmawibhangga Museum, a few hundred meters north from Borobudur.|$|E

5|$|In October 2012, {{with the}} project still unfinished, the museum {{published}} a report examining {{the reasons for the}} delay and <b>additional</b> <b>cost.</b> It found that the museum had greatly underestimated the work required due to the poor condition of the locomotive, much of which had been missed by a rushed inspection, which produced an overly optimistic assessment which was not based on engineering realities. It also found that once the project was underway, management lacked the experience, continuity or resources to undertake such a complex task, which was also hampered by illness and recruitment issues. Although the museum had a formal contract system to manage suppliers, managers failed to implement it properly, and it was ill-suited to the cottage industry nature of the heritage railway sector which the suppliers were largely drawn from, many of whom had failed to meet their contractual targets. Problems were also caused by the conflicting objectives of producing a certified main line locomotive while retaining as many original components and assemblies as possible, and between the need to overhaul the locomotive {{and use it as a}} marketing tool for the museum. The report recommended that the NRM consider the scope, size and responsibilities of their project management and engineering functions, and their contracting policy.|$|E
5|$|Nevadas {{construction}} was authorized by an Act of Congress on 4 March 1911. The contract went to Fore River Shipbuilding Company on 22 January 1912 {{for a total}} of $5,895,000 (not including the armor and armament), and the time of {{construction was}} originally to be 36 months. A secondary contract was signed on 31 July 1912 for $50,000 to cover the <b>additional</b> <b>cost</b> of a geared cruising unit on each propeller shaft; this also extended the planned construction time by five months. Her keel was laid down on 4 November 1912, and by 12 August 1914, the ship was 72.4% complete. Nevada was launched on 11 July 1914; she was sponsored by Miss Eleanor Anne Seibert, niece of Governor Tasker Oddie of Nevada and a descendant of the first Secretary of the Navy, Benjamin Stoddert. The launch was attended by several prominent members of the government, including Governor Oddie, Governor David I.
