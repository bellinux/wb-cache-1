5|$|As part of {{promotion}} for {{the songs}} release as a single, an accompanying music video {{was shot at}} Venice Beach, California, and directed by Dave Meyers. The content of the video revolves around couples who try to resolve their differences and arguments. In the video, scenes of Lewis performing {{in front of a}} heart engulfed in flames <b>and</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> an apartment floor barefoot are intercut. In the United States, Lewis performed the song live on the Late Show with David Letterman, whilst in the United Kingdom, she performed on multiple television shows, including So You Think You Can Dance, The Alan Titchmarsh Show and The National Lottery Draws. It was included on the set list of her debut tour, The Labyrinth (2010).|$|E
5|$|The Smoking Gunns defended their WWF Tag Team Championship in {{the next}} match against Owen Hart and his mystery partner, who was {{revealed}} to be Yokozuna. The Gunns worked together to control the match at the beginning, but Yokozuna gained control by performing a leg drop on Billy Gunn. Hart attempted to perform a dropkick from the top rope but accidentally hit Yokozuna. The Gunns briefly took control until Yokozuna performed a belly to belly suplex and landed on Billy. He then performed a Banzai Drop, jumping from the second rope <b>and</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> Billy's chest. Hart tagged in and considered performing the Sharpshooter submission hold; instead, he pinned Billy Gunn to win the title belts for his team.|$|E
5|$|Authorities {{received}} the first distress {{call from a}} person who escaped from the restaurant at 12:38pm, and the first police car reached the building at 12:47pm. The policemen were armed with the standard equipment for Czech police officers: holstered pistols (mostly with variants of CZ75 that was also used by Kovář), body armor, and a select-fire rifle stored in car. The first two officers to arrive immediately entered the building with body armor on and guns drawn. , taking cover behind a bar opposite to the door, opened fire on the officers {{as soon as they}} entered. The police noted people lying on the ground <b>and</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> chairs between them and the shooter. Not knowing the status of the civilians, the police decided not to return fire, covered the exits, and waited for the arrival of a tactical unit. By this time, other police units as well as the first ambulance car had arrived, taking away the wounded female victim who had escaped.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the party}} was {{established}} a Political Bureau ("Politburo") and Organisation Bureau ("Orgburo") to accompany the existing Central Committee; the decisions of these party bodies had to be adopted by Sovnarkom and the Council of Labour and Defence. Lenin was the most significant figure in this governance structure; {{as well as being}} the Chairman of Sovnarkom <b>and</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> the Council of Labour and Defence, he was on the Central Committee and Politburo of the Communist Party. The only individual to have anywhere near this influence was Lenin's right-hand man, Yakov Sverdlov, who died in March 1919 during a flu pandemic. In November 1917, Lenin and his wife took a two-room flat within the Smolny Institute; the following month they left for a brief holiday in Halia, Finland. In January 1918, he survived an assassination attempt in Petrograd; Fritz Platten, who was with Lenin at the time, shielded him and was injured by a bullet.|$|E

25|$|Taíno {{society was}} divided into two classes: naborias (commoners) and nitaínos (nobles). These were governed by male chiefs known as caciques, who were advised by priests/healers known as bohiques. Caciques enjoyed the {{privilege}} of wearing golden pendants called guanín, living in square bohíos, instead of the round ones of ordinary villagers, <b>and</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> wooden stools to be above the guests they received. Bohiques were extolled for their healing powers and ability to speak with gods. They were consulted and granted the Taíno permission to engage in important tasks.|$|E
25|$|The video {{opens with}} a shot of running water. Rihanna is then {{presented}} undressing and climbing into a bathtub. Throughout {{the rest of the}} video, the singer is presented nude in the tub full of cloudy green water; subtle camera angles protect her modesty. Rihanna is shown wearing little make-up and with long hair tangled and wet over one side of her face. The singer seems morose and sad as she occasionally flickers her eyes to the ceiling and puts her head in her hands, showing off long manicured nails and a diamond stud earring. The low-key video also features Mikky Ekko, who performs his parts of the song separately including scenes of him {{perched on the edge of}} a different bathtub, gazing into a mirror, in front of an unlit fireplace, <b>and</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a grand chair. The video switches between the pair throughout the course of the video until it concludes with a single tear falling from Rihanna's eye as she sinks lower into the bathtub.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, the Century and the Regal {{once again}} became {{versions}} of the same car, only offered as a four-door sedan, <b>and</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a revised W platform that was shared with the Oldsmobile Intrigue, the Pontiac Grand Prix, the Chevrolet Lumina and Chevrolet Monte Carlo. Differences between the Regal and Century were mostly cosmetic. As the upmarket version, the Regal offered larger engines and fancier trim, and once again boasted a newer version of the 3.8L V6. While the Century was mainly a reliable, economy-minded car based upon the W-body, the Regal was fitted with many amenities, including heated leather seats (optional on the Century), a Monsoon 8-speaker surround sound system, dual climate control, and expansive interior space. Few changes occurred during this version's seven-year run. It offered 5-passenger seating on all trim levels like the Pontiac Grand Prix and Oldsmobile Intrigue (formerly Cutlass Supreme), unlike their predecessors that had optional 6-passenger seating and the Buick Century (formerly built on the A platform) which had standard 6-passenger seating.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year (in July 1934), they visited Angola once again. This time Lead Belly begged {{them to make}} a recording of a song he had written to take to the Governor requesting parole, which they did. However, unbeknownst to them, Lead Belly was released in August for good time (and because of cost-cutting due to the Depression) and not because of the Lomaxes' recording, which the Governor may not have listened to. In September 1934, Lead Belly wrote to Lomax requesting employment, since he needed to have a job in order not to be sent back to prison. At the urging of John Jr., Lomax engaged Lead Belly as his driver and assistant, and the pair traveled the South together collecting folk songs for the next three months. Then, in December 1934, Lead Belly famously performed illustrating John Lomax's scheduled lecture of folk songs at a smoker and sing-along held at the national MLA meeting in Philadelphia (see Lead Belly). Their association continued for three more months until the following March (1935). In January, Lomax, who knew nothing whatever about the recording business, became Lead Belly's manager and, through a friend, cowboy singer Tex Ritter, got Lead Belly a recording contract with the famous A man Art Satherly of ARC records. Satherly had publicity photos made of the singer wearing overalls <b>and</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> sacks of grain, garb and setting that were customary in commercial publicity photos of country singers in those days. But Lead Belly's recordings, marketed as race music, failed to sell. A filmed re-enactment in early 1935 for The March of Time newsreel of Lomax's discovery of Lead Belly in prison, led to the myth that John Lomax made Lead Belly perform in prison stripes (which is inaccurate). He did perform in overalls, however. During Lomax's two-week lecture tour with Lead Belly on the eastern college circuit in March 1935 (pre-scheduled by Lomax before teaming up with Lead Belly), the two men quarreled over money and never spoke to one another again.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Vida" [...] was {{released}} on 15 November 2010. It was filmed in Mexico and directed by Argentinian filmmaker Joaquín Cambre. In an interview, Joaquín Cambre commented that he [...] "tried to represent that mix of feelings crafting an ambience [...] of hope inside of a story that inetivably has a tragic end. Ricardo Arjona plays the song while listening to the story playing on an old disc." [...] On the video, Arjona is seen on an old room, playing guitar <b>and</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a couch, close to a bed, while singing the lyrics. In between, scenes showing a family reaching to a house, in which {{the father of the}} men is laying, close to death. As of 28 July 2012, the video has reached 3.9 million views on YouTube.|$|E
500|$|The show {{began with}} the video {{introduction}} [...] "The Britney Spears Experience", in which three images of Spears welcomed spectators to the show. Then, a giant metal orb was lowered onstage and lifted again to reveal Spears standing behind it, wearing a pink halter top (some shows It was orange), a side silver jacket, and glittery jeans. Spears started with two dance-oriented performances of [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] and [...] "Stronger". This was followed by [...] "What U See (Is What U Get)" [...] in which she removed her silver side jacket and she danced on a stripper pole wearing a pink cowboy hat. The act ended with Spears talking to the audience <b>and</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a stool to perform [...] "From The Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] with her guitarist Skip.|$|E

500|$|During planning, the Allies {{identified}} three areas as key and decisive terrain in the area: the beach north of Katika, which was later codenamed [...] "Scarlet" [...] by the Allies, the [...] peak called Sattelberg [...] {{to the south}} west, which dominated the area due to its height, and Finschhafen, possessing a small airfield <b>and</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> the coast in a bay which offered protected harbour facilities. Before the war, the town had {{a population of about}} 30 white and 60 native people. There were good anchorages for vessels of up to 5,000 tons in Dreger Harbour, Langemak Bay, and Finsch Harbour. The flat coastal strip provided a number of potential airfield sites. German names abounded in the area because the Territory of New Guinea [...] was a German colony from 1884 until it was occupied by Australia in 1914.|$|E
500|$|During planning, the Allies {{identified}} three areas as key and decisive terrain in the area: the beach north of Katika, which was later codenamed [...] "Scarlet" [...] by the Allies, the [...] peak called Sattelberg [...] to the south-west, which dominated the area {{due to its}} height, and Finschhafen, possessing a small airfield <b>and</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> the coast in a bay which offered protected harbour facilities [...] south of Scarlet Beach. The Japanese, too, regarded Sattelberg and Finschhafen as key areas. In addition to these, they identified a ridge that ran between the village of Gusika on the coast, about [...] north of Katika, and Wareo [...] inland to the west. The importance of this ridge lay in the track that ran along it, over which the Japanese supplied their forces around Sattelberg. It also offered a natural barrier to any advance north from Finschhafen, making it a potential defensive line.|$|E
