40|$|INTRODUCTION Haemostasis and {{adhesion}} prevention {{in surgery}} is {{of paramount importance}} to prevent complications. It is even more important in neurosurgical procedures where even minor complications can lead to devastating consequences. There is constant work in the direction of development of both haemostatic and anti-adhesion agents with recent research with the use of chitosan dextran gel and autologous muscle tissue showing promise. Normal wound healing following surgery may lead to adhesion formation with the development of adhesions correlating to the presence and amount of blood clot. This linking of bleeding and adhesion formation is key to adhesion prevention. The amount and site of adhesion formation will often influence the postoperative course of the patient. While there have been many substances developed in an attempt to prevent adhesions, this thesis will examine Chitosan dextran (CD) gel and muscle for their potential role in neurological surgery. CD gel has previously been shown to be effective as a haemostat and as an anti- <b>adhesion</b> <b>agent</b> in endoscopic sinus surgery while autologous muscle {{has been shown to be}} effective with major vascular injury. This thesis will examine Chitosan Dextran gel in central nervous system and also try to explore the potential mechanisms of action of muscle tissue in bleeding control. METHODS The haemostatic and anti adhesion potential of Chitosan Dextran gel was studied with the help of sheep models. A neurosurgical burr hole model was used to assess the safety and efficacy of Chitosan Dextran gel on the dura and brain tissue. Bleeding control was tested at the level of bone, dura and brain separately with both Chitosan Dextran gel and Gelfoam paste on separate burr holes. Baseline bleeding was measured at the time of injury using the Boezaart scale, and then every two minutes after the application of each agent until complete haemostasis or 10 minutes, whichever was earlier. Safety was assessed through MRI scans and histopathological analysis. To further assess the antiadhesion potential of Chitosan Dextran gel, a sheep model of spinal laminectomy was used. Gelfoam paste was again used as the control agent. Following the laminectomy procedure and exposure of dura, the test agent, i. e, Chitosan Dextran gel or Gelfoam or normal saline wash was applied on the dura and the wound was closed. Healing was allowed for three months. The efficacy of adhesion prevention was assessed by Peel test and MRI scans. Histopathology was performed to assess safety of the agent. In vitro studies were performed to evaluate the haemostatic action of muscle tissue. Muscle extracts were prepared by dissolving crushed snap-frozen muscle tissue in saline. Plain saline was used as control. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time, and platelet aggregation studies were performed on both muscle extract and saline. Prothrombin time and APTT were repeated using factor VII–deficient plasma, factor X–deficient plasma, lupus plasma, and contact pathway inhibited plasma. RESULTS 1. The efficacy and safety profiles of Chitosan Dextran gel were comparable to those of Gelfoam in the neurosurgical burr hole study. The logistic regression model suggested that Chitosan Dextran gel was more effective at stopping bleeding after two minutes, the clinical significance may be small and this should be tested in a model with greater volume of bleeding with more intervention numbers. 2. With regards to antiadhesion efficacy of Chitosan Dextran gel in the sheep model of laminectomy there was a significant reduction in adhesions when compared to the untreated (normal saline) group. However when compared to the Gelfoam treated group there was no significant difference. MRI did not show any difference in the overall epidural fibrosis among the three groups. 3. In vitro muscle coagulation studies did not show any significant difference between muscle and saline except in the APTT using factor X-deficient plasma. Higher concentrations of muscle extract showed an increase in platelet aggregation. CONCLUSION Chitosan Dextran gel is an effective safe haemostatic and anti-adhesive agent in the central nervous system. Further work is needed to extend its use in neurosurgical procedures in humans. Platelet aggregation appears to play an important role in the haemostatic action of muscle tissue and further study of this mechanism may improve the development of new topical haemostatic agents.

Despite this, most survey respondents still rely on surgery alone.|$|R

30|$|This is {{the first}} {{meta-analysis}} of the efficacy of 4  % icodextrin solution as an <b>adhesion</b> prevention <b>agent</b> in gynaecological surgery to the authors’ knowledge. It has demonstrated {{that there is a}} dearth of evidence regarding the use of 4  % icodextrin solution. The findings suggest that currently, there is insufficient evidence to support that 4  % icodextrin solution is effective at preventing adhesions in gynaecological surgery compared to RLS. Although 4  % icodextrin solution is cheaper and easier toapply than other commercial adhesion-prevention agents, if it does not prevent adhesions it is neither in the patient’s best interest, or cost-effective to continue using it. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommends that the mAFS score should be used when evaluating adhesion prevention agents; however in addition to this, data should be published in complete and in a way which allows for comparison with other studies. Alternative <b>adhesion</b> prevention <b>agents</b> should continue to be considered for gynaecological surgery.|$|R
30|$|Introduction: The wound status {{generated}} by enucleation and suturing during LM might influence the postoperative adhesion formation {{regardless of the}} use of <b>adhesion</b> preventing <b>agents,</b> because several investigators have reported that potential wound adhesions are related to the characteristics of the myomas. We investigated the incidence of adhesions at sites of uterine myomectomy at second-look laparoscopy (SLL) in order to determine whether the uterine repair at LM influenced postoperative adhesion formation.|$|R
30|$|Postoperative {{abdominal}} adhesions {{are one of}} {{the most}} common post-laparotomy complications observed. Several types of <b>adhesion</b> preventative <b>agents</b> are available and their effectiveness and adverse impact have been clinically evaluated in previous studies. However, few basic studies have tested whether those agents do not trigger any unwanted xenobiotic reaction, which makes some surgeons hesitant to use them. To clarify this point, we investigated whether the <b>adhesion</b> preventative <b>agent</b> Seprafilm® (KAKEN PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD., Tokyo, Japan), one of the most widely used hyaluronate-based bioresorbable membrane (HBBM), can trigger an inflammatory response in normal abdominal tissue and delay the healing process. The rat underwent laparotomy and a HBBM was placed directly below the incision. Tissue samples at the incision and away from the incision (normal tissue) were harvested and inflammatory response and fibrosis were evaluated using quantitative PCR and histological scoring. We found that HBBM did not induce inflammatory cytokine expression at mRNA level in the peritoneal wall tissue or modify the fibrosis process in the abdominal cavity. These findings confirm the safety of using HBBM for the prevention of adhesion development post-laparotomy.|$|R
40|$|Modern {{green algae}} {{constitute}} {{a large and}} diverse taxonomic assemblage that encompasses many multicellular phenotypes including colonial, filamentous and parenchymatous forms. In all multicellular green algae, each cell is surrounded by an extracellular matrix, most often {{in the form of}} a cell wall. Volvocalean taxa like Volvox have an elaborate, gel-like, hydroxyproline rich glycoprotein covering that contains the cells of the colony. In ulvophytes, uronic acid-rich and sulfated polysaccharides are the likely <b>adhesion</b> <b>agents</b> that maintain the multicellular habit. Charophytes also produce polysaccharide-rich cell walls and in late divergent taxa, pectin plays a critical role in cell-adhesion in the multicellular complex. Cell walls are products of coordinated interaction of membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics and the cell’s signal transduction machinery responding both to precise internal clocks and external environmental cues. Most often, these activities must be synchronized with the secretion, deposition and remodeling of the polymers of the extracellular matrix. Rapid advances in molecular genetics, cell biology and cell wall biochemistry of green algae will soon provide new insights into the evolution and subcellular processes leading to multicellularity...|$|R
30|$|Endometriosis is a {{very common}} gynaecological condition, with the ovaries being the most {{frequent}} site of disease [6]. Deposits are often found {{on the underside of}} the ovary, causing the ovary to become adherent to the ovarian fossa. Surgical treatment involves releasing the ovary from its fossa by a combination of sharp and blunt dissection and either ablation or excision of the disease. At the end of the procedure, therefore, there are two opposing raw surfaces, which are very prone to re-adhere. As such, it is common practice to use some form of <b>adhesion</b> preventative <b>agent</b> to try and avoid this.|$|R
30|$|A {{product called}} Seprafilm® (KAKEN PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD., Tokyo, Japan), {{one of the}} most widely used hyaluronate-based bioresorbable {{membrane}} (HBBM), is a well-known <b>adhesion</b> preventative <b>agent,</b> however, little information about whether it can induce any unwanted immune reaction in the local tissue is not clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate whether inflammatory reactions, especially a xenobiotic reaction, are elicited by implanting a HBBM in the abdominal cavity. If no unfavorable xenobiotic reaction to normal tissue and no influence of healing process are confirmed, it should help to feel safe for the use of HBBM to reduce the post-laparotomy complications due to abdominal adhesions.|$|R
30|$|<b>Adhesion</b> {{prevention}} <b>agents</b> broadly {{fall into}} two categories: site specific and non-site specific. The latter rely on hydrofloatation of the viscera postoperatively to allow healing to occur with the viscera separated and therefore, theoretically, decreasing the chance of adhesion formation. Clearly, to be effective, however, the viscera have to float. Whilst this is obviously likely in an air-containing viscera such as the bowel, the same cannot be assumed of other organs. The most commonly used solutions for hydrofloatation are either Hartmann’s solution, normal saline (sometimes heparinised) or 4 % icodextrin solution. We therefore conducted a simple experiment to see if ovaries floated in these solutions.|$|R
30|$|Oxidized {{regenerated}} cellulose (Interceed®, Ethicon–J&J, Somerville, NJ, USA) {{is the most}} widely used <b>adhesion</b> prevention <b>agent</b> and has been shown to reduce adhesion formation in both animal and human studies.

The efficacy of Interceed® has been studied in more than 13 clinical trials that included 600 patients. A meta-analysis of ten randomized, controlled studies reported a 24.2  % reduction in adhesion formation on the side treated with Interceed [71]. Despite this report, concerns about Interceed® continue, especially regarding its efficacy in preventing adhesions and its apparent ineffectiveness in the presence of blood. In this setting, Interceed® may aggravate rather than prevent adhesion formation.|$|R

30|$|Considering {{the factors}} in {{selecting}} an anti-adhesion agent, evidence that an <b>agent</b> reduces <b>adhesions</b> and was safe were cited as key.

Evidence of impact on adhesion-related outcomes was also considered important. There are however very few studies that have looked at the impact of an agent on clinical outcomes such as pregnancy, reduction in SBO or ease of re-operative surgery, largely because of the complexity of undertaking clinical outcome studies in surgery [32]. Regulatory authorities require studies of <b>adhesion</b> reduction <b>agents</b> for regulatory approval to focus on adhesion reduction [33] and clinical outcome studies are likely to remain beyond their scope.|$|R
30|$|A {{number of}} postsurgical <b>adhesion</b> {{preventative}} <b>agents</b> are available. The efficacy of these agents has been evaluated in animal models (Bae et al. 2005; Lim et al. 2009; Ozcelik 2003; Harris et al. 1995; Shimizu et al. 2014; Oncel et al. 2005), {{as well as}} several large scale human clinical studies (Becker et al. 1996; Diamond 1996; González-Quintero and Cruz-Pachano 2009). The safety of these agents is usually determined by monitoring the patients’ vital signs and laboratory tests, which enables the detection of a systemic reaction against the preventative agents. However, xenobiotic reaction can happen locally (Böstman et al. 1990; Böstman 1992), and the effect of localized application of these reagents in the abdominal cavity, i.e., the potential adverse effects on normal tissues {{in the vicinity of the}} treatment site or remote tissues to which the reagent has spread, have not been examined.|$|R
30|$|Notwithstanding the {{response}} rate, the survey indicates that amongst what were largely senior-level gynaecological surgeons, {{there is a}} general increased awareness of the risk and seriousness of adhesions. However, gynaecological surgeons are not yet routinely advising patients of the risk of adhesions as part of the consent process. Despite evidence indicating that changes in surgical practice have had little impact on reducing adhesion complications, most surgeons responding currently rely on surgery alone as their anti-adhesion strategy. With increasing evidence supporting the efficacy of <b>adhesion</b> reduction <b>agents</b> to complement good surgical practice, as the recent ESGE consensus position on adhesion management proposes, it is timely for all gynaecological surgeons to act on adhesions. This survey of UK gynaecological surgeons provides a useful benchmark for future action on adhesions and similar studies in other countries may be useful to allow for subsequent audit of the recent ESGE consensus proposals for action on adhesions [4, 5].|$|R

Randomised-controlled trials comparing the use of 4  % icodextrin solution vs. Ringer’s-lactated saline (control) in women of any age undergoing fertility-conserving surgery either by laparoscopy or laparotomy were searched and meta-analysis performed. Compared to Ringer’s-lactated saline, {{there was no significant difference}} in the number of patients free from de novo adhesions at second-look laparoscopy (SLL) (odds ratio, 1.21 [0.76, 1.93]), the adhesion score reduction at SLL (mean difference (MD), 0.71 [− 0.66, 2.08]), the percentage reduction in adhesion extent (MD, 5.47 [− 4.18, 15.12]) or severity (MD, 13.49 [− 23.78, 50.75]). The included studies reported the effect of 4  % icodextrin in different ways thus limiting meta-analysis. This is the first meta-analysis of icodextrin and the lack of evidence found to support the use of icodextrin suggests further research is required which should be presented in a uniform manner.|$|R
30|$|Abdominal adhesions form as {{a result}} of the {{inflammatory}} response to peritoneal trauma, when the mesothelial lining, which separates tissues, is disrupted. Surgical trauma to the mesothelial layer of peritoneum leads to bleeding and leakage of plasma proteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin- 1, interleukin- 6 and tumour necrosis factor-α. Fibrin is deposited at the site of tissue damage and either gets degraded or is transformed into a permanent connective tissue structure, namely, an adhesion. Adhesion prevention strategies have been developed by either using site-specific or more generally active <b>adhesion</b> reducing <b>agents.</b> Icodextrin 4 % solution (Adept™) is now commonly used in gynaecological minimal access surgery and open procedures for prevention of adhesions.

For comparison, the esterification reaction using dodecanoyl chloride was adopted to modify the surface of the newspaper pulp prior to mixing with the PP matrix. Experimental results revealed that the MAPP was a good coupling agent for newspaper pulp/PP composites. The mechanical properties of the composites with MAPP were better than the ones without MAPP. Likewise, surface modification by esterification helped to promote the compatibility between the newspaper pulp and PP. Although, comparing to the MAPP-newspaper pulp/PP composites, the strength of esterified-newspaper pulp/PP composites was lowered; it was found that this surface treatment increased the flexibility and elongation at break of the composites. In conclusion, the polypropylene/ 20 % newspaper pulp with 10 % MAPP by weight of newspaper pulp composite showed the highest mechanical properties.

The activating anti-ICAM- 3 HP 2 / 19, but not other anti-ICAM- 3 mAb, was able to enhance T lymphoblast adhesion to these proteins when combined with very low doses of anti-CD 3 mAb, which were unable by themselves to induce this phenomenon. In contrast, anti-ICAM- 1 mAb did not enhance T cell attachment to these substrata. T cell adhesion to ICAM- 1, VCAM- 1, FN 40, and FN 80 was specifically blocked by anti-LFA- 1, anti-VLA alpha 4, and anti-VLA alpha 5 mAb, respectively. The activating anti-ICAM- 3 HP 2 / 19 was also able to specifically enhance the VLA- 4 - and VLA- 5 -mediated binding of leukemic T Jurkat cells to VCAM- 1, FN 40, and FN 80, {{even in the absence}} of cooccupancy of the CD 3 -TcR complex. We also studied the localization of ICAM- 3, LFA- 1, and the VLA beta 1 integrin, by immunofluorescence microscopy, on cells interacting with ICAM- 1, VCAM- 1 and FN 80. We found that the anti-ICAM- 3 HP 2 / 19 mAb specifically promoted a dramatic change on the morphology of T lymphoblasts when these cells were allowed to interact with those adhesion ligands. Under these conditions, it was observed that a large cell contact area from which an uropod-like structure (heading uropod) was projected toward the outer milieu. However, when T blasts were stimulated with other <b>adhesion</b> promoting <b>agents</b> as the activating anti-VLA beta 1 TS 2 / 16 mAb or phorbol esters, this structure was not detected. The anti-ICAM- 3 TP 1 / 24 mAb was also unable to induce this phenomenon. Notably, a striking cell redistribution of ICAM- 3 was induced specifically by the HP 2 / 19 mAb, but not by the other anti-ICAM- 3 mAb or the other <b>adhesion</b> promoting <b>agents.</b> Thus, ICAM- 3 was almost exclusively concentrated in the most distal portion of the heading uropod whereas either LFA- 1 or the VLA beta 1 integrin were uniformly distributed all over the large contact area. Moreover, this phenomenon was also observed when T cells were specifically stimulated with the HP 2 / 19 mAb to interact with TNF alpha-activated endothelial cells.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} a crosslinked hyaluronic acid (HA) {{for the prevention of}} postsurgical adhesions after laparoscopic myomectomy using the Harmonic Ace. Materials and Methods: Women 23 - 42 years of age who wished to conceive underwent laparoscopic myomectomy. As <b>adhesion</b> preventing <b>agents,</b> crosslinked HA gel was applied on the myometrial scar {{at the end of the}} surgery in Group A, whereas in Group B a Ringer's lactate solution was used in a prospective, observational study. Second-look mini-laparoscopy was performed 45 - 60 days after surgery and the adhesions were assessed according to a site-specific modified scoring. Results: The incidence of postoperative adhesions was the same in both groups, but anatomically significant adhesions and site-specific modified score was significantly reduced in Group A compared to Group B control group (31. 8 % vs 54. 6 % and 1. 05 ± 1 vs 2. 27 ± 2. 5, respectively). Conclusion: The use of auto-cross-linked HA gel confirms a protection on adhesion formation on myometrial wounds, although the degree of this effect appears to be weak. The absence of adnexa adhesions using the HA and a different uterine incision appear remarkable, although a larger number of patients is required to confirm the present findings...|$|R
40|$|Eosinophils are {{effector}} cells that migrate toward several mediators released at inflammatory sites {{to perform their}} multiple functions. The mechanisms driving eosinophil selective accumulation in sites of allergic inflammation are well established and involve several steps controlled by <b>adhesion</b> molecules, priming <b>agents,</b> chemotactic and surviving factors. Even though the majority of studies focused on role of protein mediators like IL- 5 and eotaxins, lipid mediators also participate in eosinophil recruitment and activation. Among the lipid mediators with distinguish eosinophil recruitment and activation capabilities are platelet activating factor (PAF) and the eicosanoids, including leukotriene B 4, cysteinyl leukotrienes and prostaglandin D 2. In this review, we focused {{on the role of}} these four lipid mediators in eosinophil recruitment and activation, since they are recognized as key mediators of eosinophilic inflammatory responses...|$|R
