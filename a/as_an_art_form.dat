It provided a basis for six TV programmes over the following months. There was, however, little real discussion of photography <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>art</b> <b>form.</b>|$|E
5|$|Photography in Denmark has {{developed}} from strong participation {{and interest in}} the very beginnings of the art in 1839 {{to the success of}} a considerable number of Danes in the world of photography today.

Although Denmark was slow to accept photography <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>art</b> <b>form,</b> Danish photographers are now increasingly active, participating in key exhibitions around the world.|$|E

5|$|Andjar {{became a}} writer for the {{theatrical}} troupe Dardanella in November 1930, working under the group's founder Willy A. Piedro. Andjar believed the troupe to be dedicated to the betterment of the toneel <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>art</b> <b>form</b> and not only motivated by financial interests, as were the earlier stambul troupes. He wrote and published many plays with the group's backing, including Dr Samsi and Singa Minangkabau (The Lion of Minangkabau). Andjar also worked as a theatre critic, writing several pieces on the history of local theatre, sometimes using his birth name and sometimes his pseudonym. In 1936 Andjar went with Dardanella to India to record a film adaptation of his drama Dr Samsi, which followed a doctor who was blackmailed after an unscrupulous Indo discovered he had an illegitimate child. The deal fell through, however, and Andjar left India with his wife Ratna.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in black-and-white tones, using lighting, film grain effects and minimal ambient sounds to create an eerie atmosphere often associated with the horror genre. Journalists praised the dark presentation, describing the work as comparable to film noir and German Expressionism. Based on its aesthetics, reviewers classified Limbo {{as an example of}} video games <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>art</b> <b>form.</b> Limbo received positive reviews, but its minimal story polarised critics; some critics found the open-ended work to have deeper meaning that tied well with the game's mechanics, while others believed the lack of significant plot and abrupt ending detracted from the game. A common point of criticism from reviewers was that the high cost of the game relative to its short length might deter players from purchasing the title, but some reviews proposed that Limbo had an ideal length. The title was the third-highest selling game on the Xbox Live Arcade service in 2010, generating around $7.5 million in revenue. The title won several awards from industry groups after its release, and was named {{as one of the top}} games for 2010 by several publications. Playdead's next title, Inside, was released in 2016, and revisited many of the same themes presented in Limbo.|$|E
