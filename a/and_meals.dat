40|$|Individually fed steer calves (n= 90) {{were used}} to {{evaluate}} different rendering procedures of pork meat <b>and</b> bone <b>meal</b> on protein quality as compared to soybean meal.

5|$|The {{biggest concern}} was food; {{ensuring}} {{there was enough}} food occupied most of the internees' time.

Everyday, the internees were served rice congee at 8am, <b>and</b> <b>meals</b> consisting of rice with stew at both 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. Additionally, they relied on food mailed from friends or relatives in the city, Red Cross aid, garden-grown vegetables, and bought food from the canteen or the black market.|$|E

5|$|Szilard {{received}} German {{citizenship in}} 1930, but was already {{uneasy about the}} political situation in Europe. When Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933, Szilard urged {{his family and friends}} to flee Europe while they still could. He moved to England, and transferred his savings of £1,595 (£ today) from his bank in Zurich to one in London. He lived in hotels where lodging <b>and</b> <b>meals</b> cost about £5/5 a week. For those less fortunate, he helped found the Academic Assistance Council, an organization dedicated to helping refugee scholars find new jobs, and persuaded the Royal Society to provide accommodation for it at Burlington House. He enlisted the help of academics such as Harald Bohr, G. H. Hardy, Archibald Hill and Frederick G. Donnan. By the outbreak of World War II in 1939, it had helped to find places for over 2,500 refugee scholars.|$|E
40|$|Whether {{the long}} acting {{somatostatin}} analogue SMS 201 - 995 (octreotide, Sandostatin) could inhibit the basal <b>and</b> <b>meal</b> stimulated hypergastrinaemia <b>and</b> hyperpepsinogenaemia induced by omeprazole was investigated. Eight healthy subjects were randomised to receive five day courses of SMS 201 - 995 (25 micrograms subcutaneously three times daily), omeprazole (40 mg once a day), {{a combination of}} both drugs, or placebo. Basal <b>and</b> <b>meal</b> stimulated serum gastrin and basal serum pepsinogen A and C values were measured the day before treatment, on day five of treatment, and the day after each course of treatment. Omeprazole caused significant increases in basal <b>and</b> <b>meal</b> stimulated peak <b>and</b> integrated serum gastrin values and pepsinogen A and C levels, which were still significantly raised the day after stopping omeprazole treatment. Giving SMS 201 - 995 with omeprazole significantly reduced any omeprazole induced increases in basal <b>and</b> <b>meal</b> stimulated peak <b>and</b> integrated serum gastrin levels; serum pepsinogen A and C values were significantly inhibited too. Serum gastrin values during combined therapy were not significantly different from those during placebo treatment, whereas pepsinogen A and C levels were still significantly raised. On the day after stopping combined therapy, basal <b>and</b> <b>meal</b> stimulated peak <b>and</b> integrated serum gastrin and serum pepsinogen C (but not pepsinogen A) levels were not significantly different from values obtained on the day after stopping omeprazole alone. SMS 201 - 995 without omeprazole significantly inhibited basal <b>and</b> <b>meal</b> stimulated peak <b>and</b> integrated serum gastrin levels. Pepsinogen A was also significantly inhibited by SMS 210 - 995, but the reduction in pepsinogen C failed to reach statistical significance. In conclusion, SMS 201 - 995 prevents basal <b>and</b> <b>meal</b> stimulated increases in serum gastrin during omeprazole therapy. This finding may have clinical importance in the few patients who have pronounced hypergastrinaemia because of profound long acting acid inhibition...|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} compete with rival {{shipping}} company Cunard, the White Star Line offered their steerage passengers modest luxuries, {{in the hopes that}} emigrants would write to relatives back home and encourage them to travel on White Star Line ships. Third class passengers had their own dining facilities, with chairs instead of benches, <b>and</b> <b>meals</b> prepared by the third class kitchen staff. On other liners, the steerage passengers would have been expected to bring their own food. Rather than dormitory-style sleeping areas, third class passengers had their own cabins. The single men and women were separated, women in the stern in two to six berth cabins, men in the bow in up to ten berth cabins, often shared with strangers. Each stateroom was fitted with wood panelling and beds with mattresses, blankets, pillows, electric lights, heat and a washbasin with running water, except for the bow cabins which did not have a private washbasin. Two public bathtubs were also provided, one for the men, the other for women.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{separate}} efforts {{to establish a}} Naval Academy football team in 1879. The first was guided by first-classman J.H. Robinson, who developed it as a training regiment {{to help keep the}} school's baseball team in shape. The team played the sport under rules that made it much closer to soccer, where the players were permitted only to kick the ball in order to advance it. The second effort, headed by first-classman William John Maxwell was more successful in its efforts. Maxwell met with two of his friends, Tunstall Smith and Henry Woods, who played for the Baltimore Athletic Club and officially challenged their team to a game with the Naval Academy. A team was formed from academy first-classmen, which Maxwell led as a manager, trainer, and captain. The team would wake up and practice before reveille and following drill <b>and</b> <b>meals.</b> The squad received encouragement from some of the faculty, who allowed them to eat a late dinner and skip final drill for additional practicing. This was against the direct orders of the school superintendent, who had banned football and similar activities.|$|E
