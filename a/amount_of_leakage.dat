Methodology: This case study with multiple subjects, constituted a sample group of 14 women, who underwent a retraining urogynecology program (Manual Reeducation, Electrical Stimulation and Biofeedback), twice a week for a total of twenty sessions, lasting three months. Before and after the program, perineometry was performed to assess the strength of maximum voluntary contraction of the pelvic muscles, and pad-test to quantify urinary leakage.

40|$|Abstract- Due to Technology scaling the {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>leakage</b> power has significantly {{increased in the}} modern day system-on-chip devices. The runtime leakage component during the active state is almost becoming equal to the standby leakage component. Hence Present day research is more focused on reduction <b>of</b> runtime <b>leakage</b> current. we present a novel runtime leakage reduction for 70 nm technology. As an attempt to save the leakage power in the active mode, run-time power gating is explored at various design levels. In the present work we propose a power control method based on Transient Time Slot (TTS) of a logic gate. Using static timing analysis, for each logic gate of the circuit we find its idle period (non-transition period) within the clock period. We switch off the power supply during that period which saves significant <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> run time <b>leakage</b> power. The Logic gates are partitioned according to a heuristic algorithm proposed into clusters so that pair of control transistors is attached to each cluster. Power is supplied only during Transient Time Slot. We simulated ISCAC’ 85 bench mark circuits and observed that there is significant <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> run time <b>leakage</b> saved. We designed a multiplier using the proposed approach and observed about 85 % <b>of</b> runtime <b>leakage</b> savings. Later we simulated c 6288 netlist which is a ideal transistor netlist and observed that same <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> runtime <b>leakage</b> power is saved as that of TTS method.

The sample consisted of 32 female athletes from Famalic&# 227;o Athletic Volleyball Club (Portugal). The athletes were selected by convenience and distributed randomly into two groups: experimental group (EG = 16 athletes) and the control group (CG = 16 athletes). The EG underwent PFMRP for three months. The PFMRP was the awareness and identification of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM), pre-timed PFM contraction prior to occasions of increased intra-abdominal pressure, and 30 daily contractions of MPP at home. The CG had only access to the pamphlet. The assessment instruments included the questionnaires, the Pad Test (<b>amount</b> <b>of</b> urinary <b>leakage)</b> and frequency record <b>of</b> urinary <b>leakage</b> (7 -day diary) before and after PFMRP.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of two different root canal irrigation solutions (5. 25 % NaOCl followed by 17 % EDTA and QMix) on the apical sealing ability of two different root canal sealers (MTA Fillapex and Adseal). Methods. Forty-six single-canal teeth were divided into 4 experimental groups of 10 teeth each and a positive and negative group of 3 teeth each. The root canals were prepared using step-back technique. The teeth in groups 1 and 2 were irrigated with 5. 25 % NaOCl followed by 17 % EDTA and the teeth in groups 3 and 4 were irrigated with QMix. Finally all the teeth were flushed with sterile saline and dried using paper points. Obturation was accomplished by gutta-percha using lateral condensation technique. MTA Fillapex sealer was used in groups 1 and 3 whereas Adseal was used in groups 2 and 4. Dye penetration method was used to evaluate apical leakage.

50|$|The above test {{procedure}} describes how to determine total duct leakage, {{or how much}} leakage there is {{for all of the}} ductwork connected to the HVAC system. Another test is for duct leakage to the outside.

Energy conservation is improved mostly by sealing ductwork that is outside the thermal envelope or connected to the outside.
