5|$|Wesley, aware the Enterprise is in orbit, {{arranges}} for {{the children}} to passively resist. When the Aldeans request Picard's help to resolve the issue with the children, the crew finds a way to beam through the shield, allowing Commander Riker and Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) to sneak onto the planet. Data manages to disable the Custodian, disrupting the Aldean's transporter and planetary shield. Dr. Crusher explains to the Aldeans that their shield has weakened the ozone layer of their planet, exposing the inhabitants to ultraviolet radiation that has left them unable to bear children. The radiation would likely have the same effects on the children from the Enterprise. Without the planetary shield, the ozone layer will naturally return, allowing the Aldeans to reproduce again. The Aldeans recognize the error of their ways and return the children to the Enterprise. They accept Starfleet's help to correct their ancient systems <b>and</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> they will have to forgo their invisibility to continue their society.|$|E

25|$|Many art {{programs}} in Christian institutions consider nudity {{in any form}} to be in conflict with their beliefs, and therefore hire only clothed models for art classes, which may bring into question the completeness of the art education offered. However other Christian institutions see no conflict but rather maintain the need for nude figure studies {{as part of a}} complete classical art education, <b>and</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> an appreciation of the beauty of the human body is compatible with a Christian education.|$|E

Rogers, {{described as a}} skilled administrator who was sensitive {{to the need for}} the NPS to work with SHPO, academia and local governments, was picked to lead this newly merged associate directorate. When the NPS had reorganized in the mid-1960s it had eliminated the positions of regional historians and chosen instead to merge those positions into Utley's Washington office. The 1983 reorganization of the directorates in control of Register activities represented a return to the organization pre-MISSION 66.|$|E
25|$|Dance, music, {{colorful}} ceremonial {{dresses and}} other arts are a notable feature of religious expression among Balinese Hindus. As in India, these expressions celebrate various mudra to express ideas, grace, decorum and culture. Dance-drama is common. Various stories are expressed. For example, one involves {{a battle between}} the mythical characters Rangda the witch (representing adharma, something like disorder) and Barong the protective spirit represented with a lion mask (representing dharma), in which performers fall into a trance, the good attempts to conquer evil, the dancers express the idea that good and evil exists within each individual, and that conquering evil implies ejecting evil from oneself. The dance-drama regularly ends undecided, neither side winning, because the primary purpose is to restore balance <b>and</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> the battle between dharma and adharma (good and evil) is within each person and a never ending one. Barong, or dharma, is a major symbolic and ritual paradigm found in various festivities, dances, arts and temples.|$|E

500|$|The {{open-ended}} {{nature of}} the lyrics has led to many interpretations. Journalist Michael Campbell believed the lyrics send [...] "a message of hope" [...] and wish for a [...] "world that is not divided by class, wealth, race, or any other arbitrary criterion". With regard to the place Bono was referring to in the song, he said, [...] "I'm not sure, really, about that. I used {{to think it was}} Belfast..." [...] Journalist Niall Stokes believes the title was influenced by Bono's and his wife Ali's visit to Ethiopia as volunteer aid-workers. Bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open-ended lyrics: [...] "I can look at it now <b>and</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> [...] {{has one of the most}} banal couplets in the history of pop music. But it also contains some of the biggest ideas. In a curious way, that seems to work. If you get any way heavy about these things, you don't communicate. But if you're flip or throwaway about it, then you do. That's one of the paradoxes I've come to terms with." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many Protestant reformers, {{including}} Martin Luther, John Calvin, Thomas Cranmer, John Thomas, John Knox, and Cotton Mather, {{identified the}} Roman Papacy as the Antichrist.

Such are Strategic ecosystem: beyond [...] "The Plan", Governance (a series of pages on {{reports from the}} Club of Rome, the Commission on Global Governance, and four others groups), Strategic denial: action inhibition, Post-crisis opportunities: range of strategies, and Post-crisis opportunities: strategies in chaos. A long series of pages explores how to [...] "move beyond the unimodal answer <b>and</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> because each form of action has both strengths and weaknesses, {{the key to a}} more effectively multimodal answer lies in finding how to interrelate the various unimodal answers so that they correct for each others weaknesses and counteract each others excesses.” But, it must also be asked, is integrated action of any type feasible at this time? The exploration begins with Strategic appropriateness: questionable answers, and finishes with Action implications: consensus, uncertainty and action formulation. Conditions for progress in strategy-making are more explicitly brought up in pages such as Strategic ecosystem: integrating constraint and opposition, and Post-crisis opportunities: in quest of radical coherence.|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR HOWELLS,--How {{stunning}} are {{the changes}} which age makes {{in a man}} while he sleeps. When I finished Carlyle's French Revolution in 1871, I was a Girondin; every time I have read it since, I have read it differently being influenced and changed, little by little, by life and environment (and Taine and St. Simon): and now I lay the book down once more, <b>and</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> I am a Sansculotte!--And not a pale, characterless Sansculotte, but a Marat. Carlyle teaches no such gospel so the change is in me--in my vision of the evidences.|$|E

[...] For therein he said: [...] "No great artist ever sees things as they really are." [...] Yet, that half-truth might also be put thus: The seeing of things as they really are--the seeing of a proportion veiled from other eyes (together with the power of expression), is what makes a man an artist. What makes him a great artist is a high fervour of spirit, which produces a superlative, instead of a comparative, clarity of vision.|$|E
6000|$|My {{own history}} {{includes}} an incident which will always connect me with England in a pathetic way, for when I arrived here {{seven years ago}} {{with my wife and}} my daughter--we had gone around the globe lecturing to raise money to clear off a debt--my wife and one of my daughters started across the ocean to bring to England our eldest daughter. She was twenty four years of age and in the bloom of young womanhood, and we were unsuspecting. When my wife and daughter--and my wife has passed from this life since--when they had reached mid Atlantic, a cablegram--one of those heartbreaking cablegrams which we all in our days have to experience--was put into my hand. It stated that that daughter of ours had gone to her long sleep.
