5|$|In 1873, {{the arsenal}} was renamed Little Rock Barracks {{and the main}} {{building}} used as married officers' quarters. The building was drastically altered the inside and outside. Prior to renovation, a rear basement door provided the only entrance, while the tower served as <b>a</b> <b>hoist</b> to move munitions between floors. By 1868, front and rear porches had {{been added to the}} building, as well as interior walls and stairs, some of which remain today, including the central staircase. In 1880, Douglas MacArthur was born on the northwest upper floor of this building while his father, U.S. Army Captain Arthur MacArthur, was stationed there.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{accounts}} {{show the}} details of the payments for the construction of the tower between 1398 and 1399, including charges for 36,850 bricks, stone, sand, lime, <b>a</b> <b>hoist</b> and various equipment. At least 170 cartloads of stone are mentioned, and the bricks may have been brought to the site along the river by boat, while some of the timber was brought from Great Yarmouth. The total cost of the building from these records, including labour, came to around £36. The number of bricks used in the tower, however, was probably twice the listed number purchased, and the city may therefore already have stockpiled some bricks on the location before the build.|$|E
5|$|Friday {{made his}} debut for Walthamstow on 27 March 1971, against Bromley, {{coming off the}} bench to set up Walthamstow's equaliser. His first goal came on 17 April, when playing against Tooting & Mitcham he once again {{appeared}} as a substitute and scored a header late in the game. He joined west London club Hayes in December 1971 after scoring twice against them in an Isthmian League match. Hayes offered £30 per week, and were also based closer {{to his home in}} Acton. A near-fatal accident at work in July 1972 caused Friday to undergo extensive surgery; while working on a roof in Lambeth, <b>a</b> <b>hoist</b> rope became stuck on the scaffold he was working on. The Hayes forward attempted to free the rope but fell and landed on a large spike: the spike went up through one of his buttocks, through his stomach and narrowly avoided a lung. Not only was Friday strong enough to pull himself off the spike, he recovered from his injuries within three months and returned to the Hayes team in October 1972.|$|E
50|$|New {{friction}} hoists {{are less}} expensive than new drum hoists, and the lead time for delivery may be shorter as there is more competition for manufacturing. Multi-rope friction <b>hoists</b> have <b>a</b> larger lift capacity than <b>a</b> drum <b>hoist.</b> <b>A</b> friction <b>hoist</b> is smaller in diameter than <b>a</b> drum <b>hoist</b> for the same service, {{making it easier to}} ship and install than <b>a</b> drum <b>hoist.</b>|$|R

25|$|Pave Hawk combat {{enhancements}} {{include a}} radar warning receiver, infrared jammer and a flare/chaff countermeasure dispensing system. HH-60G rescue equipment includes <b>a</b> <b>hoist</b> capable of lifting a 600-pound (270kg) load from a hover height of 200 feet (60 m), and a personnel locating system. A number of Pave Hawks {{are equipped with}} an over-the-horizon tactical data receiver {{that is capable of}} receiving near real-time mission update information.|$|E
25|$|Once the huts {{were located}} at Bordon, the 23rd Field Company Royal Engineers placed the huts. The {{movement}} of the huts was completed in May 1905. There {{were a number of}} notable accidents. In June 1903, a sapper was crushed to death underneath a hut, while the team attempted <b>a</b> <b>hoist</b> in the rain. A second hut slipped off of its railway trolleys at Whitehill, and was abandoned. It was later converted into the local police station.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{portion of}} the engine house was built in 1880-1882 and served as the mine's primary engine house. <b>A</b> <b>hoisting</b> plant {{consisting}} of two engines built by the Iron Bay Foundry of Marquette was installed in the building, and the equipment was used to haul ore from what was then known as the Incline Pit and the Sellwood (or Number 3) Pit. [...] In 1884, {{the size of the}} building was doubled, and <b>a</b> four-engine <b>hoist</b> was installed.|$|R
25|$|Also {{known as}} the Fairbanks Scale, the {{platform}} scale is a benched scale for measuring the counterbalance weight of loaded objects at ground level, thus eliminating the use of <b>a</b> <b>hoist.</b> After a series {{of trial and error}} in his designs, Thaddeus Fairbanks patented his invention in 1830. E & T Fairbanks & Company, a business partnership between Thaddeus and his brother, Erastus Fairbanks, exported their famous scales around the world to exotic locations such as England, China, Cuba, Russia, and India due to the high demand.|$|E
25|$|BTS-2 (Ob'yekt 9) (Bronetankoviy Tyagach Sredniy - Medium Armoured Tractor) - BTS-1 {{fitted with}} <b>a</b> <b>hoist</b> {{and a small}} folding crane with a {{capacity}} of 3 tonnes. It was developed on the T-54 hull in 1951; series production started in 1955. The prototype Ob'yekt 9 had a commander's cupola fitted with a DShK 1938/46 heavy machine gun, but the production model has a square commander's hatch, opening to the right. It has a combat weight of 32 tonnes. Only {{a very small number}} remains in service.|$|E
25|$|Helicopters {{have taken}} a primary role in air-sea rescue since their {{introduction}} in the 1940s. Helicopters can fly in rougher weather than fixed-wing aircraft, and they can deliver injured passengers directly to hospitals or other emergency facilities. A practical amphibious helicopter first appeared in 1941 and the water-landing feature soon proved its worth. Non-amphibious helicopters were required to hover above {{the scene of a}} water accident and utilize <b>a</b> <b>hoist</b> but amphibious helicopters were capable of setting down on the water to effect a rescue more directly.|$|E

5000|$|The {{unloaded}} {{wire rope}} of small hand-powered <b>hoists</b> often exhibits <b>a</b> snarled [...] "set", making {{the use of}} <b>a</b> chain <b>hoist</b> in this application less frustrating, but heavier. In addition, if the wire in <b>a</b> wire <b>hoist</b> fails, it can whip and cause injury, while a chain will simply break.|$|R
50|$|The two sister-ships, {{which were}} built {{side by side}} by Palmers, were {{designed}} and built specifically to serve as flagships on distant stations, primarily with the Pacific squadron. They were powered by a Maudslay horizontal twin-cylinder return connecting-rod engine, and were the last British battleships to be fitted with <b>a</b> <b>hoisting</b> screw.|$|R
25|$|The SA 330 Puma is a {{twin-engine}} helicopter {{intended for}} personnel transport and logistic support duties. As a troop carrier, up to 16 soldiers can be seated on foldable seats; in a casualty evacuation configuration, the cabin can hold six litters and four additional personnel; the Puma can also perform cargo transport duties, using alternatively an external sling or the internal cabin, {{with a maximum}} weight of 2500kg. Civilian Pumas feature a variety of passenger cabin layouts, including those intended for VIP services. In a search and rescue capacity, <b>a</b> <b>hoist</b> is commonly installed, often mounted on the starboard fuselage.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, a giraffe called Victor tore {{a muscle}} in his leg, {{collapsed}} on his stomach, and {{was unable to}} get up. The press suggested that he had slipped while trying to mate and compared his situation to the splits. All attempts to get him on his feet failed, and his plight became a major international news story. Portsmouth Dockyard made <b>a</b> <b>hoist</b> to attempt to raise him onto his feet. He {{died of a heart attack}} very shortly afterward in the arms of his keeper Ruth. The publicity turned Marwell into a major tourist attraction, and interest was revived the following summer, when Victor's mate, Dribbles, gave birth to a female calf named Victoria.|$|E
25|$|On 17 July 1991, Manser climbed unaided {{to the top}} of 30-foot high {{lamp post}} outside of the G7 media centre in London. After {{reaching}} the top, he unrolled a banner that displayed a message about the plight of Sarawak rainforests. He chained himself to the lamp post {{for two and a half}} hours. His protest also coincided with protests by Earth First! and the London Rainforest Action Group. Police used <b>a</b> <b>hoist</b> to reach the top of the lamp post and cut his chains. Manser climbed down the lamp post without force at 1:40 PM. He was then taken to the Bow street police station and held until the G7 summit ended at 6:30 PM, when he was released without being charged with an offense.|$|E

50|$|For a given {{rated load}} wire rope is lighter in weight {{per unit length}} but overall length {{is limited by the}} drum {{diameter}} that the cable must be wound onto. The lift chain of <b>a</b> chain <b>hoist</b> is far larger than the liftwheel over which chain may function. Therefore, <b>a</b> high-performance chain <b>hoist</b> may be of significantly smaller physical size than <b>a</b> wire rope <b>hoist</b> rated at the same working load.|$|R
500|$|As one {{walked into}} the tunnel, there is an {{enlarged}} chamber allowing for two-way human traffic. This was important since the walkways in the tunnel {{tend to be very}} narrow. The tunnel then splits into two. One leads to the cartridge storeroom and hoist area while the other leads to the shell storeroom and hoist area. [...] <b>A</b> <b>hoist</b> is a mechanical pulley system to lift the shells and cartridges from the underground room to the emplacement above it. The allocation of separation hoists for the shells and the cartridges allows for convenience and a more systematic operation of the gun above it.|$|E
500|$|On {{either side}} of the terreplein, wide of the 64-pound guns, are two small rooms known as the expense stores. They were used for {{ready-to-use}} ammunition for the adjacent guns, except for armour piercing shells which were stored in the rear-defence wall's archways. Between the 64-pounders and the 10" [...] gun positions are two raised observation platforms set into the structure for gun commanders to spot the fall of outgoing shells. Ranging was either performed from here or from a ranging position set in the sand hills to the fort's north. Between the 10" [...] guns is a T-shaped loading gallery that draws shells and gunpowder via <b>a</b> <b>hoist</b> system from the magazine below. Either side of the gallery was installed the Armstrong mechanical loading systems for the 10" [...] guns. These mechanical systems proved unsuccessful and were removed in the 1890s, though the southern one has been reconstructed. The magazine is accessed from the manning parade and is directly beneath the 10" [...] gun loading gallery. Voice pipes and hoists originally installed have been removed but their remains are visible.|$|E
500|$|In 1861, Bartholomew {{met with}} the chairman, Warde-Aldam, to propose a system of {{sectional}} boats, each consisting of six compartments, with a bow and stern section. The compartments or tubs would be unloaded into ships by a hydraulic hoist at Goole, which would lift them from the water and tip them over. Warde-Aldam thought that such a system could carry 45,000 tons of coal per year, and £13,382 was allocated for three train boats, <b>a</b> <b>hoist,</b> and hydraulic machinery to control the hoist and the lock into the docks. By late 1864, the prototypes were operational, with the stern section replaced by a pusher tug. Soon afterwards, extra compartments were ordered, as experience showed that a tug and seven compartments could fit into the larger locks. In 1874, Warde-Aldam noted that [...] "...the people now call them 'Tom Puddings' from their wobbling gait." [...] The length of the trains increased to ten or eleven tubs, but such a train was difficult to steer from the rear, and so the tugs moved {{to the front and}} pulled the assembly. In 1880 they carried 151,860 tons, and by 1913 there were 18 tugs, 1,010 compartments, and 1,560,006 tons were carried, 33 times Warde-Aldam's original estimate.|$|E

500|$|A 20th-century {{modification}} of the compartment boat system was used to feed the coal-fired Ferrybridge [...] "C" [...] power station. Starting in 1967, Cawoods Hargreaves used trains of three tubs or coal pans, which were rigidly connected, and pushed by a tug when loaded. The trains were filled with coal using canalside chutes at the colliery and pushed to the power station, where <b>a</b> <b>hoist</b> lifted each pan from the canal and upturned it to drop its contents onto a conveyor belt. Nine tugs and 35 pans were employed, with each pan holding around 170 tonnes. By the time the final load left Astley colliery in December 2002, 43 million tonnes had been delivered to Ferrybridge in this way. Experiments were made with trains of four pans, which allowed copper pipes to be carried {{on top of the}} coal for delivery to Goole, but this was short-lived. Coal carrying came to an abrupt halt in 2003 when the St Aidan's opencast mine was exhausted and the coal from Kellingley colliery was found to have levels of sulphur content high above the acceptable limit. During 2008, three of the trains were used on the River Don, to transport 250,000 tonnes of limestone from a quarry at Cadeby to Hexthorpe.|$|E
