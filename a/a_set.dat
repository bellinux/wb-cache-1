40|$|This paper {{presents}} some algebraic {{properties of}} some certain sets of stochastic matrices of probabilistic automata {{from the standpoint}} of their characteristic values. At first, <b>a</b> definite <b>set</b> and <b>a</b> quasidefinite <b>set</b> introduced by Paz (1965), are algebraically investigated. Then we introduce new concepts, <b>a</b> periodic <b>set</b> and <b>a</b> quasiperiodic <b>set,</b> which are defined among stochastic matrices with a period t. The results obtained from <b>a</b> periodic <b>set</b> and <b>a</b> quasiperiodic <b>set</b> have <b>a</b> remarkable correspondence to those from <b>a</b> definite <b>set</b> and <b>a</b> quasidefinite <b>set,</b> respectively, and the formers {{in the case of the}} period t = 1 coincide with the latters. It is known that <b>a</b> definite <b>set</b> and <b>a</b> quasidefinite <b>set</b> are the special case and the extended concept of actual automata, respectively, and <b>a</b> definite <b>set</b> can be associated with a definite automaton. On the other hand, it is shown that <b>a</b> periodic <b>set</b> can be associated with a bounded transient automation which is constructed from autonomous and definite machines...|$|R

5|$|Given <b>a</b> <b>set</b> with an {{addition}} operation, one cannot always define a corresponding subtraction operation on that set; {{the set of}} natural numbers is a simple example.

5|$|In 1923, John von Neumann {{developed}} an axiom system that eliminates the paradoxes {{by using an}} approach similar to Cantor's—namely, by identifying collections that are not sets and treating them differently. Von Neumann stated that a class is too big to be <b>a</b> <b>set</b> {{if it can be}} put into one-to-one correspondence with the class of all sets. He defined <b>a</b> <b>set</b> as a class that is a member of some class and stated the axiom: A class is not <b>a</b> <b>set</b> if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the class of all sets. This axiom implies that these big classes are not sets, which eliminates the paradoxes since they cannot be members of any class. Von Neumann also used his axiom to prove the well-ordering theorem: Like Cantor, he assumed that the ordinals form <b>a</b> <b>set.</b> The resulting contradiction implies that the class of all ordinals is not <b>a</b> <b>set.</b> Then his axiom provides a one-to-one correspondence between this class and the class of all sets. This correspondence well-orders the class of all sets, which implies the well-ordering theorem. In 1930, Zermelo defined models of set theory that satisfy von Neumann's axiom.|$|E
