5|$|Brock {{arrived in}} Canada {{with the rest}} of the 49th foot and was {{initially}} assigned to Montreal. Almost immediately, in 1804 he was faced with one of the primary problems in Canada: desertion. Seven soldiers stole a boat and fled across the river (and border) into the United States. Despite having no jurisdiction on American soil, Brock sent a party across the border in pursuit <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> were captured.|$|E

5|$|Jervis had the {{reputation}} as a disciplinarian and {{put in place a}} new system that would ensure that the men in the Mediterranean fleet did not mutiny. To begin with the admiral wrote a new set of standing orders. For example, Jervis divided the seamen and marines and berthed the two separately putting the marines between the officers aft <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> forward. Thus he created an effective barrier between officers and potentially unruly crews.|$|E

5|$|A duel {{was fought}} on the moor in July 1804 between Mr. Jones and Mr. Shakspere Philips. Mr. Jones fired at Mr. Philips without effect and Mr. Philips then fired his pistol in the air, {{upon which the}} seconds interfered, the two man shook hands and honour was satisfied.

5|$|A second war in Bernicia, {{probably}} in 1018, was more successful. The Battle of Carham, by the River Tweed, {{was a victory}} for the Scots led by Malcolm II <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> of Strathclyde led by their king, Owen the Bald. By this time Earl Uchtred may have been dead, and Eiríkr Hákonarson was appointed Earl of Northumbria by his brother-in-law Cnut the Great, although his authority seems to have been limited to the south, the former kingdom of Deira, and he took no action against the Scots so far as is known. The work De obsessione Dunelmi (The siege of Durham, associated with Symeon of Durham) claims that Uchtred's brother Eadwulf Cudel surrendered Lothian to Malcolm II, presumably {{in the aftermath of the}} defeat at Carham. This is likely to have been the lands between Dunbar and the Tweed as other parts of Lothian had been under Scots control before this time. It has been suggested that Cnut received tribute from the Scots for Lothian, but as he had likely received none from the Bernician Earls this is not very probable.|$|E
5|$|Alice and Meg have {{received}} Falstaff's letters. They compare them, {{see that they}} are identical and, together with Mistress Quickly and Nannetta Ford, resolve to punish Falstaff. Meanwhile, Ford has been warned of the letters by Bardolfo and Pistola. All three are thirsty for revenge and are supported by Dr Caius and Fenton, a young gentleman. To Ford's disapproval, Fenton is in love with Nannetta. Finding a moment to be alone, the young lovers exchange banter. They are interrupted by the return of Alice, Meg and Mistress Quickly. The act ends with an ensemble in which the women <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> separately plan revenge on Falstaff.|$|E

5|$|At 05:00 on 9 May 1857 {{a parade}} of the entire Meerut Division took place, to {{announce}} the sentences of the convicted men. The troops present included the 60th Rifles, 6th Dragoon Guards, and batteries of Bengal Artillery, {{as well as the}} 11th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry, the 20th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry and, dismounted, the remainder of the men of the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry. The sentences were read, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> stripped of their uniforms, then placed in shackles, while the Meerut Division watched. Despite pleas from the condemned men, none of their fellow soldiers came to their assistance. The entire process took around two hours to complete, following which the convicted soldiers were handed over to the civilian authorities and taken to the local jail under armed escort. After the parade, Hewitt communicated to his headquarters that all was calm, but during the night various junior officials received warnings of impending trouble from concerned sepoys or members of their household staff.|$|E

5|$|Bowerman and his athletes' {{philosophy}} and stories were documented by Kenny Moore. Moore {{wrote the book}} Bowerman <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Men</b> of Oregon and practiced journalism, most notably for Sports Illustrated. He also was the screenwriter with Robert Towne for Without Limits, a movie that {{told the story of}} Prefontaine and Bowerman. In addition, he was also an actor in Personal Best, a movie with track and field as one of the central themes. Bowerman himself wrote several books on the sport of running including High Performance Training for Track and Field which details coaching instruction for high level competition. He also wrote a book with a cardiologist called Jogging, which detailed the medical benefits of jogging, to which many credited its exploding popularity. Bowerman's successor, Bill Dellinger, also authored a number of books regarding running, including Competitive Runner's Training Book, The Running Experience and Winning Running.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} in Canadian waters, Curtis became friends with Governor Molyneux Shuldham who became Curtis' patron and in 1775 {{assisted}} his transfer into HMS Chatham off New York City. The following year, with the American Revolutionary War underway, Curtis was promoted to commander and given the sloop HMS Senegal. Curtis performed well in his new command {{and a year later}} was again promoted after being noticed by Lord Howe.

5|$|Following this, the 15th Battalion {{moved to}} Mouquet Farm, where they {{supported}} {{an attack by}} the 14th Battalion and carried out defensive duties. They remained there until early September, when they were withdrawn back to Warloy and then to Reingheist, via Doulens. Before this occurred, on 30 August, the 15th experienced a change in command, as Cannan, who had been promoted to brigadier-general, was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Terence McSharry. The remainder {{of the year was}} spent in the Ypres salient, around St Eloi and Boorlartbeek, before winter fell on the Western Front. It was the worst winter in Europe in 40 years, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> suffered heavily from sickness and the cold as they rotated through the line, conducting defensive duties and labouring before moving to Gueudecourt, and then later Lagnicourt, in the new year.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} four days, the Allied troops were pushed {{south-east}} towards the city of Singapore. Throughout this time, the battalion's companies were in almost constant action, either—in the case of 'B', 'C', 'D' and 'E' Companies—under separate command, or 'A' and 'HQ' Companies with Battalion Headquarters. The reinforcements of 'E' Company, detached to the Special Reserve Battalion, suffered heavily. In three days, they lost 43 men killed or missing, before the ad hoc formation was disbanded <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> returned to the 2/4th. 7 Platoon, 'B' Company, took on a mounted role, procuring four Bren carriers, with which they began patrolling in support. On 12 February they were engaged along the Buona Vista Road, while supporting the Malayan Regiment. The following day, they were attacked by a Japanese light tank, which knocked {{out one of the}} carriers before the platoon extricated themselves.|$|E
