5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb is {{the only}} known {{exoplanet}} in the orbit of host star MOA-2009-BLG-387L. The planet {{is estimated to be}} 2.6 times the mass of Jupiter. However, because knowledge of the exact parameters of the planet are tied to the host star's parameters, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>host</b> star's parameters are not well-constrained, uncertainty places MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb's mass between 1.0 and 6.7 times that of Jupiter. The planet is estimated to orbit its host star every 1970 days at a distance of 1.8 AU, some 1.8 times the mean distance between Earth and the Sun. Uncertainty broadens the mean distance to between 1.1 and 2.7 AU.|$|E
5|$|Maria {{competed in}} the Diva Search in 2004, {{deciding}} to enter the contest after seeing an advertisement while watching Raw. Even though she only placed fifth in the contest, she {{was hired by the}} company. She stood out in the contest by giving fellow contestant Carmella DeCesare the finger after being eliminated from the contest. Maria began making appearances in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), WWE's then-developmental territory. She contributed booking ideas, and her work at OVW earned her a spot on the Raw brand roster. Maria was brought on to Raw as a ditzy backstage interviewer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>host</b> of WWE KissCam in November 2004. Her gimmick involved her asking wrong questions, irritating and amusing the roster.|$|E

Jacob Tullin Thams had won the 1924 Winter Olympics event and has also won the 1926 World Championships, making him reigning Olympic and world champion. The rest of the delegation consisted Alf Andersen, Sigmund Ruud—the oldest of the Ruud brothers—and Hans Kleppen. Andersen had won all eight Norwegian qualifications for the Olympics. Other favorites were Rudolf Burkert, who had won and the ski jumping part of the Nordic combined event, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>host</b> nation's Gérard Vuilleumier. Asia participated {{for the first time}} in an international tournament, represented by Japan's Motohiko Ban.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes {{inhabited}} the Earth from approximately 3–4 billion years ago. No obvious changes in morphology or cellular organisation occurred in these organisms {{over the next}} few billion years. The eukaryotic cells emerged between 1.6–2.7 billion years ago. The next major change in cell structure came when bacteria were engulfed by eukaryotic cells, in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis. The engulfed bacteria <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>host</b> cell then underwent coevolution, with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes. Another engulfment of cyanobacterial-like organisms {{led to the formation of}} chloroplasts in algae and plants.|$|E

5|$|The {{grasshopper}} nematode (Mermis nigrescens) {{is a long}} slender worm that infects grasshoppers, {{living in}} the insect's hemocoel. Adult worms lay eggs on plants <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>host</b> becomes infected when the foliage is eaten. Spinochordodes tellinii and Paragordius tricuspidatus are parasitic worms that infect grasshoppers and alter the behaviour of their hosts. When the worms are sufficiently developed, the grasshopper is persuaded to leap into a nearby body of water where it drowns, thus enabling the parasite {{to continue with the}} next stage of its life cycle, which takes place in water.|$|E

The Gliders would win the Osaka Cup again under Triscai in 2010 and 2012, and would be runners-up in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Bishop's work {{evolved to}} include studies of drug {{resistance}} {{in both the}} parasites <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>host</b> organisms, the studies that would earn her {{a place in the}} Royal Society. Significant work from this period of Bishop's life included a study showing that the parasite itself did not develop resistance to quinine, but that host organisms could develop resistance to the drug proguanil. Her in vitro research was proven accurate when the drugs she studied were used to treat patients suffering from tertian malaria, a form of the illness in which the paroxysm of fever occurs every third day. She also investigated the drugs pamaquine and atebrin, along with proguanil, though proguanil was the only one shown to cause the development of drug resistance. Other studies showed that malaria parasites could develop cross-resistance to other antimalarial drugs. Bishop worked at Molteno until 1967. Her research and experimental protocols were later used in rodent and human studies, albeit with modifications.|$|E

5|$|In September 1985, the Board of Governors of the World Bank {{endorsed}} the Convention establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency. MIGA was established and became operational on April 12, 1988 {{under the leadership}} of then-Executive Vice President Yoshio Terasawa, becoming the fifth member institution of the World Bank Group. MIGA initially had $1 billion ($1.94 billion in 2012 dollars) in capital and 29 member states. All members of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) were eligible to become members of the agency. MIGA was established as an effort to complement existing sources of non-commercial risk insurance for investments in developing countries, and thereby improve investor confidence. The agency's mandate to be apolitical has been said to be an advantage over private and national risk insurance markets. By serving as a multilateral guarantor, the agency reduces the likelihood of confrontations among the investor's country <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>host</b> country.|$|E
5|$|Like live action, machinima is {{recorded}} in real-time, and real people can act {{and control the}} camera. Filmmakers are often encouraged to follow traditional cinematic conventions, such as avoiding wide fields of view, the overuse of slow motion, and errors in visual continuity. Unlike live action, machinima involves less expensive, digital special effects and sets, possibly with a science-fiction or historical theme. Explosions and stunts can be tried and repeated without monetary cost and risk of injury, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>host</b> environment may allow unrealistic physical constraints. University of Cambridge experiments in 2002 and 2003 attempted to use machinima to re-create {{a scene from the}} 1942 live-action film Casablanca. Machinima filming differed from traditional cinematography in that character expression was limited, but camera movements were more flexible and improvised. Nitsche compared this experiment to an unpredictable Dogme 95 production.|$|E
5|$|The Fast5 Series is a {{competition}} {{among the top}} six national netball teams, as ranked by the INF World Rankings. It is organised by the INF {{in conjunction with the}} national governing bodies of the six competing nations, UK Sport, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>host</b> city's local council. The All England Netball Association covers air travel, accommodation, food and local travel expenses for all teams, while the respective netball governing bodies cover player allowances. It is held over three days, with each team playing each other once during the first two days in a round-robin format. The four highest-scoring teams advance to the semi-finals; the winners face each other in the Grand Final. The competition features modified fastnet rules and has been likened to Twenty20 cricket and rugby sevens. A new format featuring shorter matches with modified rules was designed to make the game more appealing to spectators and television audiences. The World Netball Series was held annually in England from 2009 to 2011.|$|E
