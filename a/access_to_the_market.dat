25|$|The Xuanpingmen {{gate was}} the main gate between the city and suburbs. The {{district}} north of the Weiyang Palace was the most exclusive. The main market, called the Nine Markets, was the eastern economic terminus of the Silk Road. <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> was from the Northeast and Northwest gates, which were the most heavily used by the common people. The former connect with a bridge over the Wei River to the northern suburbs and the latter connected {{with the rest of}} China to the east. An intricate network of underground passages connected the imperial harem with other palaces and the city. These passages were controlled by underground gatehouses and their existence was unknown.|$|E
25|$|Maersk instead {{chose to}} target the {{inclusive}} tours charter market. The first customer was Karavane Rejser, who chartered a flight to Corsica. To gain better <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> Maersk bought two travel agents in December 1971, Raffels Rejser and Bangs Rejser. Thereafter the airline bought five used Boeing 720Bs in 1973. This was followed up with purchasing the tour operator Unisol in 1974. The three agencies were merged {{to form a new}} agency under the brand Unisol and 120,000 annual trips. Unisol—Denmark's third largest inclusive tours travel agency—was placed under the industrial department in Maersk, while the airline reported directly to the executive administration. This caused a lack of coordination between the companies and Maersk never made money from the inclusive tours operations.|$|E

The 1999–2003 Commission on Self-Governance even proposed that Greenland should aim at Thule Air Base's removal from American authority and operation under the aegis of the United Nations.|$|E
500|$|Cournot, a {{professor}} of mathematics, developed a mathematical treatment in 1838 for duopoly—a market condition defined by competition between two sellers. [...] This treatment of competition, first published in Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth, {{is referred to as}} Cournot duopoly. It is assumed that both sellers had equal <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> and could produce their goods without cost. [...] Further, it assumed that both goods were homogeneous. [...] Each seller would vary her output based on the output of the other and the market price would be determined by the total quantity supplied. [...] The profit for each firm would be determined by multiplying their output and the per unit Market price. [...] Differentiating the profit function with respect to quantity supplied for each firm left a system of linear equations, the simultaneous solution of which gave the equilibrium quantity, price and profits. Cournot's contributions to the mathematization of economics would be neglected for decades, but eventually influenced many of the marginalists. [...] Cournot's models of duopoly and Oligopoly also represent one of the first formulations of non-cooperative games. [...] Today the solution can be given as a Nash equilibrium but Cournot's work preceded modern game theory by over 100 years.|$|E
60|$|Our city, tho' {{laid out}} with a {{beautiful}} regularity, the streets large, straight, and crossing each other at right angles, had the disgrace of suffering those streets to remain long unpav'd, and in wet weather the wheels of heavy carriages plough'd them into a quagmire, {{so that it was}} difficult to cross them; and in dry weather the dust was offensive. I had liv'd near what was call'd the Jersey Market, and saw with pain the inhabitants wading in mud while purchasing their provisions. A strip of ground down the middle of that market was at length pav'd with brick, so that, being once in the market, they had firm footing, but were often over shoes in dirt to get there. By talking and writing on the subject, I was at length instrumental in getting the street pav'd with stone between the market and the brick'd foot-pavement, that was on each side next the houses. This, for some time, gave an easy <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> dry-shod; but, the rest of the street not being pav'd, whenever a carriage came out of the mud upon this pavement, it shook off and left its dirt upon it, and it was soon cover'd with mire, which was not remov'd, the city as yet having no scavengers.|$|E

After some inquiry I found a poor industrious man who was willing to undertake keeping the pavement clean, by sweeping it twice a week, carrying off the dirt from before all the neighbours' doors, for the sum of sixpence per month, to be paid by each house. I then wrote and printed a paper, setting forth the advantages to the neighbourhood that might be obtained from this small expense; the greater ease in keeping our houses clean, so much dirt not being brought in by people's feet; the benefit to the shops by more custom, as buyers could more easily get at them; and by not having, in windy weather, the dust blown in upon their goods, &c. I sent one of these papers to each house, and in a day or two went round to see who would subscribe to an agreement to pay these sixpences; it was unanimously signed, and, for a time, well executed. All the inhabitants of the city were delighted with the cleanliness of the pavement that surrounded the market, it being a convenience to all, and this raised a general desire to have all the streets paved, and made the people more willing to submit to a tax for that purpose. After some time I drew a bill for paving the city and brought it into the Assembly. It was just before I went to England, in 1757, and did not pass till I was gone, and then with an alteration in the mode of assessment, which I thought not for the better; but with an additional provision for lighting as well as paving the streets, which was a great improvement. It was by a private person, the late Mr. John Clifton, giving a sample of the utility of lamps, by placing one at his door, that the people were first impressed with the idea of lighting all the city. The honour of this public benefit has also been ascribed to me, but it belongs truly to that gentleman. I did but follow his example, and have only some merit to claim respecting the form of our lamps, as differing from the globe lamps we were at first supplied with from London. They were found inconvenient in these respects: they admitted no air below; the smoke, therefore, did not readily go out above, but circulated in the globe, lodged on its inside, and soon obstructed the light they were intended to afford; giving, besides, the daily trouble of wiping them clean: and an accidental stroke on one of them would demolish it, and render it totally useless. I therefore suggested the composing them of four flat panes, with a long funnel above to draw up the smoke, and crevices admitting air below to facilitate the ascent of the smoke; by this means they were kept clean, and did not grow dark in a few hours, as the London lamps do, but continued bright till morning; and an accidental stroke would generally break but a single pane, easily repaired. I have sometimes wondered that the Londoners did not, from the effect holes in the bottom of the globe-lamps used at Vauxhall have in keeping them clean, learn to have such holes in their street-lamps. But these holes being made for another purpose, viz., to communicate flame more suddenly to the wick by a little flax hanging down through them, the other use of letting in air seems not to have been thought of: and, therefore, after the lamps have been lit a few hours, the streets of London are very poorly illuminated.|$|E

40|$|We analyze firms’ {{production}} and hedging decisions under imperfect competition with potential entry. Specifically, we consider an oligopoly industry producing a homogeneous output in which risk-averse firms incur a sunk cost {{upon entering the}} industry, and, then, compete in Cournot with one another. Each firm faces uncertainty in the input cost when making production decision, and has <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> futures <b>market</b> <b>to</b> hedge its random cost. We provide two sets of results. First, we show that there exists a unique equilibrium in which, in contrast to previous results in the literature, {{production and}} output price depend {{on the distribution of}} the spot price and risk aversion, i. e., there is no separation when <b>the</b> firms have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> futures <b>market.</b> Second, we study <b>the</b> effect of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> futures <b>market</b> on entry, production, and prices. <b>The</b> effect of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> futures <b>market</b> on <b>the</b> number of firms is ambiguous depending on the value of the futures price and the parameters of the model.
