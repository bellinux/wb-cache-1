It's just being mastered, it's a lovely album; I didn't write this one, this is old songs and I have to sort out my situation- I don't want the same problem as before.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy commented {{on the structure of}} the series' first season. [...] "I loved how it began. I loved it in the middle and I loved the end. The only thing really frustrating for me, to be honest with you, is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it up as we went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, [...] go back and see all of the little things, like people who have no reflections in mirrors. When you go back, you will see everything was set up." [...] When asked if the House [...] "pulled" [...] the Harmons to it, Murphy responded, [...] "I don't know if they were targeted. I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary. <b>And</b> <b>also</b> <b>I</b> think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{having written}} about eight songs while on tour in 2005, Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy {{decided to write}} new music because they wanted the album to be [...] "...quite new, to be quite {{different}} sounding from everything we've ever done before." [...] Despite having recorded their second album in {{a short amount of}} time, Kapranos stressed that the band wanted to take their time. He voices, [...] "This time we wanted to spend more time developing, <b>and</b> <b>also,</b> <b>I</b> suppose, allowing songs and sounds to evolve more before we ended up writing an album, and absorbing more music and ideas and, I suppose, life itself. And when I say life, I mean life off the road, because I wouldn't classify life on the road as real life." [...] Franz Ferdinand began working on Tonight in early 2007. Franz Ferdinand was supposed to record the album with producer Brian Higgins, yet in March 2008, the two entities parted ways. The drummer, Paul Thomson, says [...] "We wrote with Higgins for a while and initially we thought we'd work more with him but it didn't really work out. We just realized that we're not really a pop group." [...] However, they also commented they have not given up on the pop concept. The songs on the album were written and recorded at the old town hall of Govan, Scotland as well as Mr. Dan's Studio in Buckeye, Arizona. The band first moved into Govan's old town hall following a year of touring in support of their second studio album and mostly used it for storing and rehearsing.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, Oregon Public Broadcasting {{published}} an article titled [...] "What is Cesar Chavez's Connection to Oregon?" [...] The article centers on the controversial public debate at the time regarding whether a Portland street should be {{named in honor of}} Cesar Chavez. Those opposed to honoring Chavez with a Portland street had occasionally argued that the activist had no presence in the state. The article contains an interview with a man who assisted Chavez during a public address he made at the state Capitol in Salem, Oregon. The article concludes with an interview with Joseph Gallegos, an early faculty member of Colegio Cesar Chavez who claims that during the 1970s and 1980s [...] "the Colegio was a critical symbol of our presence, the Latino presence here in the state, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>I</b> think trying to bring attention to the problem the Colegio was trying to address, that Latinos were not getting through the four-year institutions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Describing the {{composition}} of [...] "Oh Yeah", the album's best known track, Blank said, [...] "First I did the music and then I invited Dieter to sing along, and {{he came up with}} some lines which I thought, 'no Dieter, it's too complicated, we don't need that many lyrics'. I had the idea of just this guy, a fat little monster sits there very relaxed and says, [...] "Oh yeah, oh yeah". So I told him, 'Why don't you try just to sing on and on 'oh yeah'?... Dieter was very angry when I told him this and he said, 'are you crazy, all the time [...] "Oh yeah"? Are you crazy?! I can't do this, no no, come on, come on.' And then he said, 'some lyrics, like [...] "the moon... beautiful", is this too much?!' and I said, 'no, it's OK', and then he did this 'oh yeah' and at the end he thought, 'yeah it's nice', he loved it himself also. <b>And</b> <b>also</b> <b>I</b> wanted to install lots of human noises, all kind of phonetic rhythms with my mouth; you hear lots of noises in the background which are done with my mouth." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1991, {{with the}} {{expansion}} of the popularity of their band, Will Sin decided to release an EP entitled [...] "U Make Me Feel" [...] with an unknown female singer under the pseudonym Elsi Curry, and it was released as a promotional record. Later that same month, after the Sixth Mark of the Synergy Tour, and a one-week tour of Russia, the Shamen headed to Tenerife, to film a video for [...] "Move Any Mountain". On 23 May, Will Sinnott drowned whilst swimming off the coast of La Gomera. Colin Angus later said: [...] "When it first happened, I was still reeling from the shock of Will's completely unexpected and tragic death, and I couldn't think about the Shamen at all, couldn't see how anything could continue. But as I came to terms with it and thought about the situation I realised that what the Shamen was about was positivity and that positivity is like the spirit of the music and positivity acknowledges the need for change. So for those reasons I elected to carry on <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>I</b> knew that the name Shamen really meant a lot to Will {{and that was one of}} the main attractions for joining the band for him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Steven [...] "Bajo" [...] O'Donnell (Series 2–12) took on {{the role}} as host {{following}} the resignation of Mike Makowski. On 9 March 2007, {{it was announced that}} he would be the new co-host. He later described the experience of joining the show as [...] "a dream come true. It felt perfect for me. It had all my interests in one little basket, creative control in a collaborative team, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>I</b> was getting to the point of giving up. The timing was perfect and unbelievably lucky." [...] He had been trying to get a job in film and TV for about 7 or 8 years, and had seen the show before, so accepted the open call-out which involved [...] "writing a review and doing a DVD presentation." [...] He said he got his [...] "dream job" [...] due to [...] "luck and persistence". He explains, [...] "Gaming was about 50% of my life , mainly PC gaming but I grew up with all the consoles... Working on the show has really opened up more genres to me that I never got into as much." [...] He described the progression from unemployed actor to host of an award winning show in 2 years as [...] "rewarding, fantastic, exciting and relieving." [...] Bajo's first gaming memory was of Ms. Pac-Man. When explaining to other what he does for a living, Bajo feels the need to defend it, explaining that [...] "it's actually really hard work".|$|E
2500|$|Although reviewers {{have read}} {{political}} intonations into the album's ostensible themes, deeming it “unashamedly prog in its ambition and dimensions”, Turner {{is reluctant to}} admit to such an agenda. [...] "I'd hesitate to call the record 'political' because Isis has never taken a public political stand on anything. At the same time, it's intended to draw a parallel between the system that Bentham created and what's {{going on in the}} world right now". Likewise, he notes that the album is “absolutely not about a political agenda. I always try to write about stuff that is specific to my life during the time I write an album. And I try to find things that I'm emotionally and intellectually attached to. We've never been a political band. But right now politics are such a great importance. You can travel everywhere and you simply cannot ignore them. And so this is one of the main things that have been occupying my mind during the creation of this record. So beyond these things just being interesting themselves they have a lot of relevance to what's {{going on in the world}} right now [...] I think these things are relevant to everybody's lives and specifically to me and this band and what we experienced through living in this country over the last couple of years. <b>And</b> <b>also</b> <b>I</b> think my lyrics are so abstract and fragmented sometimes that I feel like those things are a better representation of what I'm writing about than printed lyrics might be.” Despite his denial that Panopticon is politically motivated, Turner does refer to the then-incumbent George W. Bush administration's tenure as a source of inspiration; about how Bentham's essay bore relevance to “hit home in terms of how [...] is treating its own citizens outside and within the country.” ...|$|E
