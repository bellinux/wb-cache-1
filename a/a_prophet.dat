5|$|After his death, non-Mormon {{newspapers}} were almost unanimous in portraying Smith {{as a religious}} fanatic. Conversely, within Mormonism, Smith was memorialized first and foremost as <b>a</b> <b>prophet,</b> martyred to seal the testimony of his faith.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 7th century Muhammad was {{attacked}} by non-Muslim Arab contemporaries for preaching monotheism. In modern times, criticism has also dealt with Muhammad's sincerity in claiming to be <b>a</b> <b>prophet,</b> his morality, warfare, and his marriages.|$|E

5|$|In December 1531, the Zurich council {{selected}} Heinrich Bullinger as his successor. He immediately removed {{any doubts}} about Zwingli's orthodoxy and defended him as <b>a</b> <b>prophet</b> and a martyr. During Bullinger's rule, the confessional divisions of the Confederation were stabilised. He rallied the reformed cities and cantons and helped them {{to recover from the}} defeat at Kappel. Zwingli had instituted fundamental reforms, while Bullinger consolidated and refined them.|$|E
5|$|In his own time, Whitman {{attracted}} {{an influential}} coterie of disciples and admirers. Some, like Oscar Wilde and Edward Carpenter, viewed Whitman both as <b>a</b> <b>prophet</b> of a utopian future and of same-sex desire – {{the passion of}} comrades. This aligned with their own desires for a future of brotherly socialism.|$|E

50|$|The Quran portrays Muhammad as the Seal of the Prophets, {{which is}} {{understood}} by mainstream Sunni and Shia Muslims {{to mean that}} anyone who claims to be <b>a</b> new <b>prophet</b> after him is <b>a</b> false <b>prophet.</b> All mainstream Muslim scholars' perspectives from both Sunni and Shia sects {{do not see the}} second coming of the Messiah as the coming of <b>a</b> new <b>prophet,</b> as the Islamic Messiah Jesus had already been <b>an</b> existing <b>prophet,</b> and will rule by the Qur'an and Sunnah of Muhammad, bringing no new revelation or prophecy.|$|R
5000|$|Joseph Stacy Murdock (June 26, 1822 - February 14, 1899) was an American colonizer, leader, and Latter-day Saint hymn writer. He {{wrote the}} words to [...] "Come Listen to <b>a</b> <b>Prophet's</b> Voice." ...|$|R
5|$|In his teens, Muhammad {{accompanied}} {{his uncle}} on Syrian trading journeys to gain experience in commercial trade. Islamic tradition states that when Muhammad was either nine or twelve while accompanying the Meccans' caravan to Syria, {{he met a}} Christian monk or hermit named Bahira {{who is said to}} have foreseen Muhammad's career as <b>a</b> <b>prophet</b> of God.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{published}} many revelations {{and other}} texts that his followers regard as scripture. His teachings include unique {{views about the}} nature of God, cosmology, family structures, political organization, and religious collectivism. His followers regard him as <b>a</b> <b>prophet</b> comparable to Moses and Elijah, and several religious denominations consider themselves the continuation of the church he organized, including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Community of Christ.|$|E
5|$|The Sunnah contributed {{much to the}} {{development}} of Islamic law, particularly {{from the end of the}} first Islamic century. Muslim mystics, known as sufis, who were seeking for the inner meaning of the Quran and the inner nature of Muhammad, viewed the prophet of Islam not only as <b>a</b> <b>prophet</b> but also as a perfect human-being. All Sufi orders trace their chain of spiritual descent back to Muhammad.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Peter Waldo or any other later religious figures were directly influenced by Peter of Bruys. His low view of the Old Testament and the New Testament epistles was not shared by later Protestant figures such as Martin Luther or John Smyth. In spite of this, Peter of Bruys is considered <b>a</b> <b>prophet</b> of the Reformation by some evangelical Protestants and Anabaptists.|$|E
5|$|There {{were already}} {{converts}} to Islam among the city's Greek-speaking Christian population before Gaza's capitulation to the Muslims. At the near {{end of the}} Byzantine era, Gaza had become the home of an increasingly influential group of Arab traders from Mecca, including Umar ibn al-Khattab, who later became the second ruler of the Islamic Caliphate. Muhammad visited the city more than once before being <b>a</b> <b>prophet</b> of Islam.|$|E
5|$|In 1994 {{he played}} <b>a</b> <b>prophet</b> in Jo Brand Through the Cakehole, and in 1995 he {{performed}} on stage as Frank in Educating Rita, a No.1 National Tour. In 1996 he visited Ghana on an eight-day tour for the charity Save The Children. Mantle {{was a friend}} of Jill Dando, and played the prosecuting barrister in a TV dramatisation of the trial of Barry George in a Tonight With Trevor McDonald special, Nothing But The Truth.|$|E
50|$|Another {{mention of}} <b>a</b> false <b>prophet</b> in the New Testament is an antichrist spirit which denies the Son. The {{earliest}} encounters with Islam identified the message as antichrist and their professed <b>prophet,</b> Muhammad, as <b>a</b> false <b>prophet.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Murdock {{wrote the}} poem [...] "Come Listen To <b>A</b> <b>Prophet's</b> Voice", which {{was put to}} music by Joseph J. Daynes. The hymn was based on Murdock's {{friendship}} with Joseph Smith, for whom he had acted as a bodyguard.|$|R

5|$|Knights of the Nines quest {{begins as}} the player {{approaches}} the Chapel of Dibella in Anvil. The Chapel was recently abused; everyone {{there has been}} killed in a dark ritual. The player proceeds to consult <b>a</b> <b>prophet</b> near the scene of the attack, who is preaching about it. The prophet reveals to the player that the one responsible for the attacks is Umaril, an ancient revenge-seeking Ayleid sorcerer-king, who has escaped from his prison in Oblivion to destroy Cyrodiil. Umaril can only be defeated by the prophesized Crusader, favoured by the gods, bearing the relics of Pelinal Whitestrake, the man who originally slew Umaril, and banished his spirit to Oblivion.|$|E
5|$|Later, Means and Black {{listen to}} McKenna reading {{a passage from}} the Bible. Afterwards, McKenna reveals that she knows {{a great deal about}} the Polaroid Man who kidnapped Black weeks earlier. Means {{receives}} a vision herself during the conversation, and becomes convinced that McKenna is <b>a</b> <b>prophet</b> of some sort. Black thinks the girl is acting out, but Means reveals that she is reciting passages from the non-canonical Gnostic Gospels, which supposed that Mary Magdalene was the only disciple to fully understand the teachings of Jesus Christ. Means believes the girls are not seeing visions of Saint Mary, but of Mary Magdalene.|$|E
5|$|Lowell {{believed}} that the poet {{played an important role}} as <b>a</b> <b>prophet</b> and critic of society. He used poetry for reform, particularly in abolitionism. However, his commitment to the anti-slavery cause wavered over the years, as did his opinion on African-Americans. He attempted to emulate the true Yankee accent in the dialogue of his characters, particularly in The Biglow Papers. This depiction of the dialect, as well as his many satires, was an inspiration to writers such as Mark Twain and H. L. Mencken.|$|E

5000|$|The {{above is}} {{different}} from true prophecy in a few ways. <b>A</b> proper <b>prophet</b> would have no doubt about {{his status as a}} prophet; he would know definitely without any uncertainty that his revelation was a true prophecy. Also, while one with Holy Spirit would retain control over his body and senses, <b>a</b> <b>prophet's</b> limbs would tremble, his physical powers would weaken, and he would lose control of his senses in order that his mind be able to focus entirely on the revelation. (The sole exception to this is Moses, who retained his composure during prophecy.) ...|$|R
5|$|Shabazz was {{the subject}} of the 2013 {{television}} movie Betty & Coretta, in which she was played by Mary J. Blige. She was portrayed by Angela Bassett in the 1992 film MalcolmX. Bassett also played the part of Shabazz in the 1995 film Panther. Yolanda King, the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, played Shabazz in the 1981 television movie Death of <b>a</b> <b>Prophet,</b> and Shabazz was portrayed by Victoria Dillard in the 2001 film Ali.|$|E
5|$|Smith's {{authority}} was undermined when Oliver Cowdery, Hiram Page, and other church members also claimed to receive revelations. In response, Smith dictated a revelation which clarified his office as <b>a</b> <b>prophet</b> and an apostle, and which declared that only {{he held the}} ability to give doctrine and scripture for the entire church. Shortly after the conference, Smith dispatched Cowdery, Peter Whitmer, and others {{on a mission to}} proselytize Native Americans. Cowdery was also assigned the task of locating the site of the New Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|The {{religion}} {{was born in}} Iran, where it has faced ongoing persecution since its inception. It grew from the mid-19th century Bábí religion, whose founder taught that God would soon send <b>a</b> <b>prophet</b> {{in the manner of}} Jesus or Muhammad. In 1863, after being banished from his native Iran, Bahá'u'lláh announced that he was this prophet. He was further exiled, spending over a decade in the prison city of Akka in the Ottoman province of Syria, in what is now Israel. Following Bahá'u'lláh's death in 1892, leadership of the religion fell to his son `Abdu'l-Bahá (1844-1921), and later his great-grandson Shoghi Effendi (1897-1957). Bahá'ís around the world annually elect local, regional, and national Spiritual Assemblies that govern the affairs of the religion, and every five years the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies elect the Universal House of Justice, the nine-member supreme governing institution of the worldwide Bahá'í community, which sits in Haifa, Israel near the shrine of Báb.|$|E
