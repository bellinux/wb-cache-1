Die castings that feature proper draft are easier to remove from the die and result in high-quality surfaces and more precise finished product.|$|E
5|$|Favorinus {{argued that}} it was absurd to imagine that stars and planets would affect human bodies {{in the same way as}} they affect the tides, and equally absurd that small motions in the heavens cause large changes in people's fates. Sextus Empiricus {{argued that it}} was absurd to link human {{attributes}} with myths about the signs of the zodiac. Carneades argued that belief in fate denies free will and morality; that people born at different times can <b>all</b> <b>die</b> in the same accident or battle; and that contrary to uniform influences from the stars, tribes and cultures are all different.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by Owen Beattie, a professor of anthropology at the University of Alberta, began a series of scientific studies of the graves, bodies, and other physical evidence left by Franklin's men on Beechey Island and King William Island. They concluded that the men buried on Beechey Island most likely died of pneumonia and perhaps tuberculosis, and that lead poisoning may have worsened their health, owing to badly soldered cans held in the ships' food stores. However, it was later suggested that the source of this lead may not have been tinned food, but the distilled water systems fitted to the ships. Cut marks on human bones found on King William Island were seen as signs of cannibalism. The combined evidence of all studies suggested that the crewmen did not <b>all</b> <b>die</b> quickly. Hypothermia, starvation, lead poisoning and diseases including scurvy, along with general exposure to a hostile environment whilst lacking adequate clothing and nutrition, killed everyone on the expedition in the years following its last sighting by Europeans in 1845.|$|E

5|$|While {{pollination}} by ants {{is somewhat}} rare, several Myrmecia {{species have been}} observed pollinating flowers. For example, the orchid Leporella fimbriata is a myrmecophyte {{which can only be}} pollinated by the winged male ant M. urens. Pollination of this orchid usually occurs between April and June during warm afternoons, and may take several days until the short-lived males <b>all</b> <b>die.</b> The flower mimics M. urens queens, so the males move from flower to flower in an attempt to copulate with it. M. nigrocincta workers have been recorded visiting flowers of Eucalyptus regnans and Senna acclinis, and are considered a potential pollination vector for E. regnans trees. Although Senna acclinis is self-compatible, the inability of M. nigrocincta to appropriately release pollen would restrict its capacity to effect pollination. Foraging M. pilosula workers are regularly observed on the inflorescences of Prasophyllum alpinum (mostly pollinated by wasps of the family Ichneumonidae). Although pollinia are often seen in the ants' jaw, they have a habit of cleaning their mandibles on the leaves and stems of nectar-rich plants before moving on, preventing pollen exchange. Whether M. pilosula contributes to pollination is unknown.|$|E

25|$|After {{the group}} reels with shock and grief, Rick tells a heartbroken Maggie, still {{suffering}} from pregnancy complications, {{that they need}} to get her to the Hilltop Colony's doctor. However, Maggie insists they all head back to Alexandria and prepare to fight. Rick counters, saying they will <b>all</b> <b>die</b> if they go after Negan and his army. The group insist on continuing to the Hilltop, but Maggie demands they do not follow her. Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) volunteers to escort Maggie to the Hilltop to recover, along with the bodies of Glenn and Abraham. As a walker slowly approaches, Rick picks up his axe and joins the others in the RV. Saddened, Rick has a vision of his entire group, including Abraham and Glenn as well as Maggie's yet-born child, enjoying a peaceful outdoor meal together in Alexandria, before coming back to reality. Through the right hand side view-mirror, Rick sees the walker eating the leftover blood remains of Glenn as he drives away.|$|E
25|$|In 1891, <b>all</b> <b>Die</b> Jungen {{were either}} {{expelled}} from the SPD or left voluntarily. They then founded the Union of Independent Socialists (VUS). Rocker became a member and founded a local section in Mainz, mostly active in distributing anarchist literature smuggled in from Belgium or the Netherlands in the city. He was a regular speaker at labor union meetings. On December 18, 1892, he spoke {{at a meeting of}} unemployed workers. Impressed by Rocker's speech, the speaker that followed Rocker, who was not from Mainz and therefore did not know at what point the police would intervene, advised the unemployed to take from the rich, rather to starve. The meeting was then dissolved by the police. The speaker was arrested, while Rocker barely escaped. He decided to flee Germany to Paris via Frankfurt. He had, however, already been toying with the idea of leaving the country, in order to learn new languages, get to know anarchist groups abroad, and, above all, to escape conscription.|$|E

He told King Brian all that he had learned, took baptism, and gathered his men to come to Dublin with Brian's forces a week before Palm Sunday.|$|E

The band abandoned the idea of making a [...] "save the world" [...] concept album as they reasoned that [...] "when people talk about saving the world they're really talking about saving humans.

500|$|Suddenly, {{the action}} starts over. Mulder wakes {{to find that}} his {{waterbed}} has sprung a leak, his alarm clock is broken, {{and he needs to}} pay his landlord for water damage. To the audience, time itself is stuck in a loop. Everyone is oblivious to the repetition of events except for one person, Pam (Carrie Hamilton), Bernard's girlfriend. [...] Over multiple iterations of the events, Pam does everything in her power to save the agents, including trying to prevent them from entering the bank, trying to inform them of the time loop, and even begging Skinner not to let the police into the building. It is implied that she has lived these events many times, as she refers to having had Mulder ask her the same question over fifty times. There are subtle changes in the events, and Mulder and Scully's conversation is worded differently each time, but the results are always the same: Bernard detonates the bomb, usually after shooting Mulder, and they <b>all</b> <b>die.</b>|$|E
500|$|Bloody Fun Day {{received}} {{a positive response}} from video game critics. Psychotronic, reviewer for Jay is Games, called it [...] "an exceptionally well-crafted and deep game" [...] and [...] "refreshingly original", saying the developer [...] "gets more interesting with every new title". Kotaku Australia's David Wildgoose stated the game is [...] "rather addictive". Vue Weekly writer Darren Zenko stated that the game is addictive, finding himself playing for more than 8 hours in a day. Psychotronic disliked the lack of variety in levels, due to only one island shape being available and no enemies being present. He also highlighted the lack of special effects when using the reapers' abilities, since Cuties <b>all</b> <b>die</b> using the same animation {{regardless of whether they}} are killed with a reaper's scythe or a special ability.
