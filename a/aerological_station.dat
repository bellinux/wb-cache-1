The land was cleared, leveled, and the first hangar constructed. The 40 acre of land was officially {{designated}} as an active airport and named Fly Field after Colonel Ben Franklin Fly. In the beginning, Fly Field had limitations, including loose sand {{and a lack of}} facilities. In 1925, the Chamber's Aviation Committee decided another 160 acre was needed to create a first-class landing field in Yuma. Intense negotiations resulted in a public/private land trade, along with a promise by the government to provide Fly Field a steel frame hangar capable of housing 12 airplanes. Congressman Douglas of Arizona introduced a bill asking for the lease of 640 acre of government land to Yuma County for 20 years at a cost of $1 per year, with the privilege of renewal for another 20 years at the same rate. President Calvin Coolidge signed the Yuma Aviation Bill on February 27, 1928. Almost immediately, the aviation committee started lining up activities for the airport. Yuma was selected to be a night stop for three transcontinental air races from New York to Los Angeles, and an international air race from Mexico to Los Angeles. The Chamber agreed to provide free gas and oil to the racers, at an estimated cost of $2,000. Yuma was also selected to be a stop-over for the first All American Tour of 25 Airplanes. In June of that year, the military announced that a United States Meteorological and <b>Aerological</b> <b>station</b> would be constructed at Fly Field at a cost of $30,000 and would be manned by four Army personnel, marking the first military presence at Yuma's airport.|$|E

40|$|During {{the field}} {{campaign}} performed within the SANA-project (readjustment {{of the atmosphere}} in the five new federal states of the Federal Republic of Germany) at a flat, rural site in eastern Germany, several cases of a jumplike increase of ozone at the surface under stable conditions during the nights have been observed. The concentration jumps of ozone are on the order of 1 / 2 to 2 / 3 of the days maximum and the level is significantly higher than under normal conditions with stable stratification. The cases are correlated with an increase in wind speed, wind shear and a downward flux of ozone. In the case selected here, the increase in turbulence is caused by the evolution of a low-level jet (LLJ) with the core just above the top of surface inversion. The analysis of wind profile measurements at the <b>aerological</b> <b>stations</b> in north-eastern Germany reveals a spatial extension of the low-level jet of up to 600 km in length and 200 km in width, Thus the significance of the LLJ on the transport capability of the atmosphere is twofold: due to the large spatial extent of the LLJ and the high wind speed at the jet core level air pollutants are transported overhundreds of kilometers during one night. Secondly, due to the strong wind shear between the jet core and the ground pollutants can be mixed to the ground far away from the release area. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

TEMPERA is the first ground-based microwave radiometer {{that makes it possible}} to obtain temperature profiles in the troposphere and stratosphere at the same time. In order to characterize the clouds a multi-instrumental approach has been adopted. Cloud base altitudes were detected using ceilometer measurements while the integrated liquid water was measured by TROWARA radiometer. Both instruments are co-located with TEMPERA in Bern (Switzerland). Using this information and a constant Liquid Water Content value inside the cloud a liquid profile is provided to characterize the clouds in the inversion algorithm. Microwave temperature profiles have been obtained incorporating this water liquid profile in the inversion algorithm and also without considering the clouds, in order to assess its effect on the retrievals. The results have been compared with the temperature profiles from radiosondes which are launched twice a day at the <b>aerological</b> <b>station</b> of MeteoSwiss in Payerne (40 km W of Bern).

Hudson in 1991 were analyzed based on radiation and meteorological observations at Syowa Station (69 °S, 40 °E), east Antarctica. The direct effect is seen in solar radiation components. The normal incident solar radiation was decreased as much as 30 % of normal value in December 1991,while the diffuse solar radiation increased 50 %. In December 1992,the decrease of normal incident radiation fell 20 % and the increase of diffuse radiation fell 30 %. The indirect effect is thought to appear in atmospheric temperature and stratospheric ozone. At the altitudes where volcanic aerosol is injected, atmospheric temperature will be raised and at the altitudes below that, the temperature will drop. From Syowa <b>station</b> <b>aerological</b> data, there was little temperature increase in the lower stratosphere 6 months after the eruptions.

The data reveal the frequent development of strong nocturnal drainage flows at all sites. Down-valley nose-shaped wind speed profiles are observed with maximum values occurring at heights between 20 m and 60 m AGL. The flow intensity shows considerable inter-daily variability and a seasonal modulation of maximum speeds, which in the cold season can attain hourly average values larger than 20 m s− 1. Turbulent mixing appears significant over the full tower layer, affecting the curvature of the nighttime temperature profile and possibly explaining the observed increase of surface temperatures in the down-valley direction. Nocturnal valley winds and temperatures are weakly controlled by upper-air conditions observed at the nearest <b>aerological</b> <b>station.</b> Estimates of terms in the momentum budget for the development and the quasi-stationary phases of the down-valley flows suggest that the pressure gradient force due to the near-surface cooling along the sloping valley axes {{plays an important role}} in these drainage flows. A scale for the jet nose height of equilibrium turbulent down-slope jets is proposed, based on surface friction velocity and surface inversion intensity. At one of the sites this scale explains about 70 % of the case-to-case observed variance of jet nose heights.

40|$|AbstractThe study {{investigates the}} local {{characteristics}} of methane dispersion {{generated by the}} Pata Rat non–compliant municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill located in vicinity of Cluj–Napoca, Romania, using a numerical model developed at The Center for Promoting Entrepreneurship in the Sustainable Development Domain, from Technical University of Cluj–Napoca. The model {{was applied to the}} analysis of the methane dispersion emitted from the landfill, in two different weather conditions. In the first case the synoptic scale effects were weak favoring local flow development, while in the second case, the synoptic scale effects were predominant. The numerical model takes into account the local orography and daytime heating. In the studied area, the topography presents substantial variation, which affects the airflow dynamics. The initial conditions are formulated using observational data, recorded at the Meteorological and <b>Aerological</b> <b>Station</b> Cluj–Napoca, as well as the Meteorological Station of Cluj–Napoca International Airport. In the first case, wind direction and intensity present diurnal variations due to the thermally induced local circulations. In air layers near the ground, up to 350 – 400 m, these variations are more pronounced and significantly influence the dispersion of methane. In the second case, local effects are blurred by a more intense synoptic scale circulation. In these conditions the area affected by methane dispersion is much lower as compared to the previous case. In addition, the time intervals for presence of unpleasant odor due to landfill gases were estimated. Simulation shows that the dispersion is strongly influenced by the weather conditions and local topography. The results indicate the possibility of using the model as a decisional support in assessing the applications and strategies for air pollution control on local scale. An accurate mapping of pollutant dispersion is useful both for urban planning and residential developers...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the {{assessment}} of the tropospheric performance of a new temperature radiometer (TEMPERA) at 60  GHz. With this goal, an intercomparison campaign was carried out at the <b>aerological</b> <b>station</b> of MeteoSwiss in Payerne (Switzerland). The brightness temperature and the tropospheric temperature were assessed by means of a comparison with simultaneous and collocated radiosondes that are launched twice a day at this station. In addition, the TEMPERA performances are compared with the ones from a commercial microwave radiometer (HATPRO), which has some different instrumental characteristics and uses a different inversion algorithm. Brightness temperatures from both radiometers were compared with the ones simulated using a radiative transfer model and atmospheric profiles from radiosondes. A total of 532 cases were analyzed under all weather conditions and evidenced larger brightness temperature deviations between the two radiometers and the radiosondes for the most transparent channels. Two different retrievals for the TEMPERA radiometer were implemented in order to evaluate the effect of the different channels on the temperature retrievals. The comparison with radiosondes evidenced better results very similar to the ones from HATPRO, when the eight more opaque channels were used. The study shows the good performance of TEMPERA to retrieve temperature profiles in the troposphere. The inversion method of TEMPERA is based on the optimal estimation method. The main advantage of this algorithm {{is that there is no}} necessity for radiosonde information to achieve good results in contrast to conventional methods as neural networks or lineal regression.

40|$|Microwave {{radiometry}} is {{a suitable}} technique to measure atmospheric temperature profiles with high temporal resolution during clear sky and cloudy conditions. In this study, we included cloud {{models in the}} inversion algorithm of the microwave radiometer TEMPERA (TEMPErature RAdiometer) {{to determine the effect}} of cloud liquid water on the temperature retrievals. The cloud models were built based on measurements of cloud base altitude and integrated liquid water (ILW), all performed at the <b>aerological</b> <b>station</b> (MeteoSwiss) in Payerne (Switzerland). Cloud base altitudes were detected using ceilometer measurements while the ILW was measured by a HATPRO (Humidity And Temperature PROfiler) radiometer. To assess the quality of the TEMPERA retrieval when clouds were considered, the resulting temperature profiles were compared to 2  years of radiosonde measurements. The TEMPERA instrument measures radiation at 12 channels in the frequency range from 51 to 57  GHz, corresponding to the left wing of the oxygen emission line complex. When the full spectral information with all the 12 frequency channels was used, we found a marked improvement in the temperature retrievals after including a cloud model. The chosen cloud model influenced the resulting temperature profile, especially for high clouds and clouds with a large amount of liquid water. Using all 12 channels, however, presented large deviations between different cases, suggesting that additional uncertainties exist in the lower, more transparent channels. Using less spectral information with the higher, more opaque channels only also improved the temperature profiles when clouds where included, but the influence of the chosen cloud model was less important. We conclude that tropospheric temperature profiles can be optimized by considering clouds in the microwave retrieval, and that the choice of the cloud model has a direct impact on the resulting temperature profile...|$|E
40|$|The {{motivation}} {{of this study}} is to verify theoretical expectations placed on ground-based microwave radiometer (MWR) techniques and to confirm whether they are suitable for supporting key missions of national weather services, such as timely and accurate weather advisories and warnings. We evaluate reliability and accuracy of atmospheric temperature profiles retrieved continuously by the microwave profiler system HATPRO (Humidity And Temperature PROfiler) operated at the <b>aerological</b> <b>station</b> of Payerne (MeteoSwiss) in the time period August 2006 –December 2009. Assessment is performed by comparing temperatures from the radiometer against temperature measurements from a radiosonde accounting for a total of 2107 quality-controlled all-season cases. In the evaluated time period, the MWR delivered reliable temperature profiles in 86 % of all-weather conditions on a temporal resolution of 12 – 13 min. Random differences between MWR and radiosonde are down to 0. 5 K in the lower boundary layer and increase to 1. 7 K at 4 km height. The differences observed between MWR and radiosonde in the lower boundary layer are similar to the differences observed between the radiosonde and another in-situ sensor located on a close-by 30 m tower. Temperature retrievals from above 4 km contain less than 5 % of the total information content of the measurements, which makes clear that this technique is mainly suited for continuous observations in the boundary layer. Systematic temperature differences are also observed throughout the retrieved profile and can account for up to ± 0. 5 K. These errors are due to offsets in the measurements of the microwave radiances that have been corrected for in data post-processing and lead to nearly bias-free overall temperature retrievals. Different reasons for the radiance offsets are discussed, but cannot be unambiguously determined retrospectively. Monitoring and, if necessary, corrections for radiance offsets as well as a real-time rigorous automated data quality control are mandatory for microwave profiler systems that are designated for operational temperature profiling. In the analysis of a subset of different atmospheric situations, it is shown that lifted inversions and data quality during precipitation present the largest challenges for operational MWR temperature profiling...|$|E

Climate in this region {{is determined by the}} dominant influence of the SE Pacific subtropical anticyclone, the presence of the Andes that isolates this region from the influence of warm and moist continental air masses, and the stabilizing effect of a relatively cold adjacent ocean. A marked temperature inversion layer separates the well mixed and humid boundary layer from the subsiding dry air aloft. A layer of stratus clouds develops in {{the upper part of the}} boundary layer, spreading over a large oceanic region offshore the coast of Peru and Chile. The most remarkable feature in the evolution of surface temperature along the arid coast of northern Chile is a relatively abrupt increase during the mid- 70 ´s, particularly well defined in the daily maximum temperature regime. This evolution appears as a regional manifestation of a well documented large scale climate shift in the Pacific basin. A negative trend was detected in the series of maximum daily temperature for the periods before and after the shift, while the minimum temperature regime has remained quite stationary in recent decades. This is consistent with IPCC results showing the occurrence of a weak negative trend is sea surface temperature in the oceanic region adyacent to northern Chile during the period 1976 - 2000. Consistent with the evolution of surface temperature at coastal stations, the aerological record at Antofagasta shows a weak negative trend for temperature in the boundary layer since de mid 70 ´s, in constrast with a marked temperature increase in the layer above the temperature inversion (up to around 750 hPa). While at middle levels in the troposphere the temperature regime has remained quite stationary during recent decades, a significant negative trend is observed in the upper troposphere and the lower part of the stratosphere during the same period. Regarding the temperature inversion layer and the associated stratus cloud deck, this study confirms earlier results documenting the occurrence of a significant upward displacement of this layer during El Niño episodes. Furthermore, in addition to the ENSO-related interannual variability, the height of the inversion layer has been decreasing since the mid 70 's, particularly during the austral summer when a negative trend of around - 40 m every 10 years was detected [...] Pages: 227 - 22...|$|E
