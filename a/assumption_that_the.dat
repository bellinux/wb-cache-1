5|$|A common {{source of}} data for {{archaeoastronomy}} {{is the study of}} alignments. This is based on the <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> axis of alignment of an archaeological site is meaningfully oriented towards an astronomical target. Brown archaeoastronomers may justify this assumption through reading historical or ethnographic sources, while Green archaeoastronomers tend to prove that alignments are unlikely to be selected by chance, usually by demonstrating common patterns of alignment at multiple sites.|$|E
5|$|The {{overarching}} methodological {{principle of}} positivism is to conduct sociology in broadly {{the same manner}} as natural science. An emphasis on empiricism and the scientific method is sought to provide a tested foundation for sociological research based on the <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge, and that such knowledge can only arrive by positive affirmation through scientific methodology.|$|E
5|$|The update rule is an {{injective}} function, that is, {{there are}} no two configurations that both map to the same common configuration. This condition is obviously implied by the <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> update rule is a bijection. In the other direction, the Garden of Eden theorem for cellular automata implies that every injective update rule is bijective.|$|E

5|$|Ammianus {{puts the}} Alamanni force at around 35,000. This is {{consistent}} with two other figures he gives for Alamannic armies elsewhere in his history: an army of 40,000 in 378; and in 366 an army divided in three, with one division 10,000 strong. Nevertheless, several historians regard Ammianus' figure as unrealistically high. It has been recently suggested that in reality the Alamanni at Strasbourg may have been only about 15,000, {{much the same as}} the Romans. This calculation is based on the <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> average reported size of Alamanni raiding-bands (800 men) represented the maximum manpower of a pagus. For various reasons, the midpoint figure between these two extremes (about 25,000 men) appears the most likely scenario.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{activity}} occurs along a protein's active site. Traditional drug design methods involve tightly binding to {{this site}} and blocking its activity, under the <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> target protein exists in one rigid structure. However, this approach works for approximately only 15% of all proteins. Proteins contain allosteric sites which, when bound to by small molecules, can alter a protein's conformation and ultimately affect the protein's activity. These sites are attractive drug targets, but locating them is very computationally costly. In 2012, Folding@home and MSMs {{were used to}} identify allosteric sites in three medically relevant proteins: beta-lactamase, interleukin-2, and RNase H.|$|E
5|$|Deutschland {{was ordered}} by the Imperial Navy from the Samuda Brothers {{shipyard}} in London, UK; her keel was laid in 1872. Deutschland and her sister Kaiser were ordered shortly {{after the end of}} the Franco-Prussian War, under the <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> French would quickly attempt a war of revenge. The ship was launched on 12 September 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet on 20 July 1875. Deutschland cost the German government 8,240,000gold marks. She was the last German capital ship built by a foreign shipbuilder.|$|E

5|$|Development of Virtue's Last Reward {{began on}} the Nintendo DS, but this changed early in {{production}} following {{the announcement of the}} Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita. The development team at Chunsoft wanted to utilize the three-dimensional (3D) features of the newer systems, and changed production of the game to the Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita. As neither system had been released yet, the team was under the <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 3D features would require 3D character models. Uchikoshi later remarked that designing 3D character models proved to be a challenge for Chunsoft due to company's inexperience with 3D effects.|$|E
5|$|Euchambersia was a {{small and}} short-snouted therocephalian, {{possessing}} large canines as {{is typical of the}} group. However, it is notable among therocephalians for possessing ridges on its canines and a large indentation {{in the side of the}} skull. Under the erroneous <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> canines are grooved instead of ridged, it has been proposed that these structures supported a venom delivery mechanism. More recently, the internal structure of the skull of Euchambersia has been used as stronger evidence in favour of the hypothesis that it was venomous; other possibilities, such as the indentation supporting some sort of sensory organ, still remain plausible.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} a long-held <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{majority}} of stars occur in gravitationally bound, multiple-star systems. This is particularly true for very massive O and B class stars, where 80% of the stars {{are believed to be}} part of multiple-star systems. The proportion of single star systems increases with decreasing star mass, so that only 25% of red dwarfs are known to have stellar companions. As 85% of all stars are red dwarfs, most stars in the Milky Way are likely single from birth.|$|E

5|$|Since the 2002 {{publication}} of The Rise of the Creative Class, Florida has enjoyed academic and commercial success {{in his study}} and promotion {{of the concept of}} a creative class, or a cohort of highly innovative, highly creative individuals who are sought after by businesses. Who's Your City?, Florida's fourth book on the subject, combines scholarly research with a lighthearted self-help tone.

5|$|The Australian Army {{had entered}} the Second World War with {{inadequate}} resources due to severe cutbacks {{at the hands of}} conservative governments in the 1920s and 1930s. This was compounded by a lack of interest and appreciation of logistics on the part of its civilian and military leadership. There was an <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Australian Army would form part of an expeditionary force that would fight overseas in a larger British force. This was indeed the case in the Great War, and again in the Second World War in the Middle East and Malaya, but not in SWPA, where the Australian Army not only had to provide its own logistic support, but support to its Allies as well.|$|E

5|$|The {{best fit}} for the shape of HAT-P-33b's orbit {{suggests}} that the orbit is slightly elliptical, as the planet's orbital eccentricity is fit to 0.148. However, because the star HAT-P-33 has such {{a high level of}} jitter, it is difficult to constrain the planet's eccentricity with accuracy. Most of the planet's defined characteristics are {{based on the assumption that}} HAT-P-33b has an elliptical orbit, although the planet's discoverers have also derived HAT-P-33b's characteristics on the <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> planet has a circular orbit. The elliptical model has been chosen because it is considered to be the most likely scenario.|$|E
5|$|The credits {{printed on}} the sleeve of the first release were largely {{incomplete}} and made no distinction between the recording sessions of 1982-84 and those of 1987-88, apparently validating the false <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> original line-up of Blue Öyster Cult had reunited for {{the making of the}} album. Aside from the list of band members, the credits reported only some session musicians {{and other members of the}} so-called Guitar Orchestra of the State of Imaginos, and omitted other personnel who had contributed to Imaginos.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Rob LaZebnik, {{inspired}} by when his teenage son came out. Critical reception was mixed: the emotionally touching aspects of LaZebnik's script and Harry Shearer's portrayal of Smithers were praised. However, criticisms included the plot possibly ending the innuendo-driven humor involving Smithers' secret love of Burns, and an <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> character was being retconned due to changing attitudes on homosexuality since the series' debut. The episode was covered by international media.|$|E

5|$|The oldest {{unambiguous}} termite fossils date to {{the early}} Cretaceous, but given the diversity of Cretaceous termites and early fossil records showing mutualism between microorganisms and these insects, they likely originated earlier in the Jurassic or Triassic. Further evidence of a Jurassic origin is the <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> extinct Fruitafossor consumed termites, judging from its morphological similarity to modern termite-eating mammals. The oldest termite nest discovered {{is believed to be}} from the Upper Cretaceous in West Texas, where the oldest known faecal pellets were also discovered.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} hoard, discovered {{within a}} large ring barrow known as Istriţa Hill near Pietroasele, Romania, consisted of 22 pieces, comprising a wide assortment of gold vessels, plates and cups {{as well as}} jewellery, including two rings with inscriptions. When first uncovered, the objects were found stuck together by an unidentifiable black mass, leading to the <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hoard might have been covered {{in some kind of}} organic material (e.g. cloth or leather) prior to being interred. The total weight of the find was approximately 20kg (44lb.).|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} {{induction}} discussed above {{is seen in}} another form in debates over the foundations of statistics. The standard approach to statistical hypothesis testing avoids claims about whether evidence supports a hypothesis or makes it more probable. Instead, the typical test yields a p-value, which is the probability of the evidence being such as it is, under the <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hypothesis being tested is true. If the p-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, Bayesian inference seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include probability interpretations, overfitting, {{and the difference between}} correlation and causation.|$|E
