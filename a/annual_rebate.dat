5000|$|Each jobber, {{like each}} manufacturer, had to [...] "post bail"—"give cash {{security}} {{that he would}} carry out his bargain." [...] There was a rebate system similar to that for the manufacturers: [...] "If he had not cut prices and had not bought ware from anyone other than the corporate defendants, {{at the end of}} the calendar year, he was entitled to receive a rebate of 5 percent on the amount paid by him during the year." [...] Nearly 400 jobbers signed these agreements. They constituted more than four-fifths of all the jobbers in the country. It was estimated that the annual sales to the licensed jobbers was more than $8 million, so that their <b>annual</b> <b>rebates</b> were more than $40,000—which they would receive only if they obeyed the agreements. [...] "Moreover, the agreements told the jobbers in plain words that, if they cut prices or bought ware from anybody other than the corporate defendants, none of the latter would sell them again." [...] "The makers of nearly four-fifths of the ware and more than four out of every five dealers in it become parties to the combination." ...|$|R

5000|$|At the Dublin European Council in November 1979, Thatcher {{argued that}} the United Kingdom paid far more to the European Economic Community (EEC) than it {{received}} in spending. She famously declared at the summit: [...] "We are not asking the Community or anyone else for money. We are simply asking to have our own money back". Her arguments were successful and at the June 1984 Fontainbleau Summit, the EEC agreed on an <b>annual</b> <b>rebate</b> for the United Kingdom, amounting to 66% {{of the difference between}} Britain's EU contributions and receipts. This still remains in effect, although Tony Blair later agreed to significantly reduce the size of the rebate. It periodically causes political controversy among the members of the European Union.|$|E
50|$|The city {{created the}} Community Investment Fund to grant $252 million between 2012 and 2016 to {{renovate}} and construct new Calgarian public recreation and community facilities such as libraries. The fund provides funding for community groups to renovate their facilities that {{provide services to}} Calgarians. The fund is composed from major sources such as <b>annual</b> <b>rebate</b> of $42 million from the Alberta government, $4 million from GST refund, and $150 million from a fund created by urban developers for community growth. The fund {{was a response to}} address the need for access for recreational services, especially sports and physical facilities for children. Such as ice rinks and swimming pools. The fund also addresses the need for renovations for many aging facilities providing essential services for Calgarians.

50|$|Implementing {{this new}} policy was Louis Faidherbe, the French {{governor}} of Senegal from 1854 to 1861 and from 1863 to 1865. In 1840 a French ordinance had established Senegal {{as a permanent}} French possession with a government whose jurisdiction extended over all settlements then effectively under French control, including those in Mauritania. By undertaking the governance of these Mauritanian settlements, French rulers directly challenged Maure claims of sovereignty. Under orders from the new government of Louis Napoleon to end the coutume, to secure the gum arabic trade, {{and to protect the}} sedentary populations of the southern bank from Maure raids, Faidherbe conquered the Oualo Kingdom. He then {{turned his attention to the}} amirates of Trarza and Brakna that had united against him. The Maures attacked Saint Louis in 1855 and almost succeeded in reclaiming the settlement, but they were repulsed and defeated a year later, north of the Senegal River. The treaties ending the war extended a French protectorate over Trarza and Brakna, replaced the coutume with a 3 percent <b>annual</b> <b>rebate</b> on the value of gum arabic delivered, and recognized French sovereignty over the northern bank of the Senegal River.|$|E
40|$|Across the nation, large budget gaps {{are forcing}} state governments to make tough policy choices. While {{some states are}} trying to control spending, others are turning to tax {{increases}} to balance their budgets. Some state {{officials are trying to}} pass the buck for their poor fiscal management by pleading for a bailout from Washington. But a bailout would encourage states to continue overspending, which {{is the source of the}} current fiscal mess. The states' mistake was to allow rapid tax revenue growth during the 1990 s to fuel an unsustainable expansion in spending. Between fiscal years 1990 and 2001, state tax revenue grew 86 percent [...] more than the 55 percent of inflation plus population growth. If states had limited spending growth to that benchmark, budgets would have been $ 93 billion smaller by FY 01 [...] representing savings roughly twice the size of today's state budget gaps. If revenue growth higher than the benchmark had been given back to taxpayers in permanent tax cuts and <b>annual</b> <b>rebates,</b> rebates could have been temporarily suspended during FY 02 and FY 03 to provide a cushion with which to balance state budgets. Current budget gaps provide policymakers an opportunity to weed out the budget excesses built up during the past decade. Yet overall state spending continues to grow. After soaring 8. 0 percent in FY 01, state general fund spending has not been cut in FY 02 or FY 03 even as large budget gaps have appeared. States should impose tax and spending growth caps to prevent budgets from growing too quickly during the next boom. Revenue growth above a benchmark would be given back in tax cuts and tax rebates. That would prevent spending from increasing too quickly and provide the option of suspending rebates during slowdowns to close budget gaps without the damage caused by tax rate increases...|$|R
50|$|The {{agricultural}} sector {{is supported by}} subsidies from the European Union {{in the form of}} the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). In 2013 this represented approximately €45billion (less than 33% of the overall budget of €148billion) of the EU's total spending. It was used originally to guarantee a minimum price for farmers in the EU. This is criticised as a form of protectionism, inhibiting trade, and damaging developing countries; one of the most vocal opponents is the UK, the second largest economy within the bloc, which has repeatedly refused to give up the <b>annual</b> UK <b>rebate</b> unless the CAP undergoes significant reform; France, the biggest beneficiary of the CAP and the bloc's third largest economy, is its most vocal proponent. The CAP is however witnessing substantial reform. In 1985, around 70% of the EU budget was spent on agriculture. In 2011, direct aid to farmers and market-related expenditure amount to just 30% of the budget, and rural development spending to 11%. By 2011, 90% of direct support had become non-trade-distorting (not linked to production) as reforms have continued to be made to the CAP, its funding and its design.|$|R

40|$|Banks {{always try}} to obtain {{customers}}’ loyalty by various ways. Retail banks issue reward cards to persuade customers not to change bank. By collecting points clients can take extra services like purchasing at certain stores discount of some percent or getting an airplane ticket free if enough point is accumulated.

By using them card holders can receive back a few percent {{of the amount of}} their purchasing as an <b>annual</b> <b>rebate.</b> However collecting points seems to be a good opportunity to keep customers, the relation is not definite. In this working paper based on a preceding research we present some examples how banks try to keep their clients. ...|$|E
40|$|To contain {{expenditures}} {{in an increasingly}} demand driven health care system, in 2005 a no-claim rebate {{was introduced in the}} Dutch health insurance system. Since demand-side cost sharing is a very controversial issue, the no-claim rebate was launched as a consumer friendly bonus system to reward prudent utilization of health services. Internationally, the introduction of a mandatory no-claim rebate in a social health insurance scheme is unprecedented. Consumers were entitled to an <b>annual</b> <b>rebate</b> of 255 eruos if no claims were made. During the year, all health care expenses except for GP visits and maternity care were deducted from the rebate until the rebate became zero. In this article, we discuss the rationale of the no-claim rebate and the available evidence of its effect. Using a questionnaire in a convenience sample, we examined people's knowledge, attitudes, and sensitivity to the incentive scheme. We find that only 4 % of respondents stated that they would reduce consumption because of the no-claim rebate. Respondents also indicated that they were willing to accept a high loss of rebate in order to use a medical treatment. However, during the last month of the year many respondents seemed willing to postpone consumption until the next year {{in order to keep the}} rebate of the current year intact. A small majority of respondents considered the no-claim rebate to be unfair. Finally, we briefly discuss why in 2008 the no-claim rebate was replaced by a mandatory deductible...|$|E
40|$|All {{countries}} - whether industrial, developing, or {{in transition}} {{to a market economy}} - are interested in health care reform. A central focus of reform everywhere is to make patients more responsive to health care costs without diluting the protection offered by public or private insurance. Conventional insurance offers customers little incentive to monitor their own use of health care services or to adopt and maintain better health habits. The authors describe an alternative health insurance structure first adopted in Mendocino County, California, in 1979, and compare it with conventional forms of insurance. The Mendocino or"stay well"plan offers consumers direct incentives to control their use of health care services and to adopt healthier lifestyles. How well this insurance can contain health care costs depends {{on the size of the}} incentives and consumer responsiveness to them. Conditions in some developing countries and in many countries moving to market based economies - overuse of services, poor health habits, and declining real incomes - improves the likelihood of a favorable response to such incentives. How to structure the stay well system depends on the country, but the stay well plan is a general flexible form of insurance that subsumes most conventional plans as special cases. The rewards for low use might take many forms. As in the Mendocino plan, the rewards might be a credit to a retirement account, but they could just as easily be <b>annual</b> cash <b>rebates</b> or credits against out of pocket expenses that exceed an individual's or family's spending goal in a future period. Administration of the stay well plan appears not to be unduly complex. If anything, incorporating stay well incentives in a single-payer or national health care system would be simpler than incorporating them in a self insured fund. The success of the plan hinges on whether incentives shift the frequency distribution of health care spending by reducing unnecessary utilization in the short run and through better health care habits, reducing long run costs. Despite additional payments to low users, the stay well plan could be less expensive than conventional plans with similar coverage. As in any insurance plan, solvency is enhanced by larger groups, better risk pooling, economies of scale in administration and claims processing, and greater bargaining power with health care providers.
