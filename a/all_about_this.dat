True Hollywood Story segment, she stated that she often {{went to see the}} Groundlings perform before she joined. She said that, at one show, she went backstage and talked with Groundling member Phil Hartman and asked him what the group was <b>all</b> <b>about.</b> <b>This</b> led to her taking classes there and eventually being asked into the Groundling's main company. While Kathy was a Groundling, she became best friends with Judy Toll.|$|E

His obituarist Rupert Christiansen writes that, as a principled Marxist, Bush [...] "put the requirements of the revolutionary proletariat {{at the head of the}} composer's responsibilities", a choice which others, such as Tippett, chose not to make. [...] However, Vaughan Williams thought that, despite Bush's oft-declared theories of the purposes of art and music, [...] "when the inspiration comes over him he forgets <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> and remembers only the one eternal rule for all artists, 'To thine own self be true'." ...|$|E

He's very very {{well-known}} painter in the area there and we all call him Tom Thumb and when Tom Thumb was going through his blue period, {{this is one of}} the most important times of his whole life and he's going to sell many many paintings now taken from his blue period and this is all about Tom Thumb and his early days and so we name this Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues" ...|$|E

500|$|SFScope's Sarah Stegall {{praised the}} writers for {{showcasing}} Peter, believing Jackson gave [...] "a solid, convincing performance that teaches {{us more about}} Peter than we learned {{in the first half}} of this season". She also was pleased with Peter's reactions to the obstacles thrown in his path, but criticized the writing for having another man behind the murders ('Too much coincidence. Way too much coincidence. From a plotting standpoint, it was clumsy'). Stegall concluded her review by praising all of the actors' performances, explaining that other than the [...] "clumsy" [...] killer plot twist, [...] "I had no complaints at <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> episode. The supporting cast was top notch". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly enjoyed how the episode mystery was processed from Peter's point of view, and loved the revelation at the end about Walternate. MTV columnist Josh Wigler praised the episode's [...] "pretty mature storytelling" [...] for not making Peter [...] "go on an angry rampage" [...] or become [...] "an angsty ball of self-loathing" [...] after the previous episode's events. He continued, [...] "You can see that he's hurting, but he's still not quite sure how to process everything. Excellent work from the writers and Joshua Jackson".|$|E
500|$|Giving {{the album}} 8 on 10, Alex Needham from NME criticized the compilation's lack of new tracks, and said [...] "while far from immaculate, {{this is still}} quite a collection". About GHV2, New Strait Times Christie Leo commented that [...] "this second volume of {{greatest}} hits isn't as immediately accessible as the first. But that's not what this collection is <b>all</b> <b>about.</b> <b>This</b> 14-track set actually provides a more daring glimpse into the inner machinations of the music marketing juggernaut, Madonna". AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a mixed review calling it [...] "slightly disappointing", justifying {{that it was because}} during the 1990s, Madonna was an album artist. He finished his review saying that [...] "the end result is less {{than the sum of its}} parts, even if this is a good way to get all of Madge's 90s hits at once." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that [...] "GHV2 certainly encapsulates the second decade of the performer's boundary-bridging career", but criticized the lack of new material, and its [...] "choppy edits, random sequences and missing links", saying: [...] "the collection doesn't seem to do justice to a career that has always been ahead of the game and focused on the future". Charlotte Robinson from PopMatters criticized its sequencing, stating, [...] "Chronological sequencing would have made it easier to follow the course of Madonna's musical evolution. But would these changes have made GHV2 a significantly better album? Probably not. As it stands, it's the best summary of Madonna's second decade as a performer we're going to get." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{month before}} the U.S. broadcast, Le Guin posted on her website [...] "A Reply to Some Statements Made by the Film-Makers" [...] {{published}} in the December 2004 issue of Sci Fi Magazine. She opened with the observation, [...] "I've {{tried very hard to}} keep from saying anything at <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> production, being well aware that movies must differ in many ways from the books they're based on, and feeling that I really had no business talking about it, since I was not included in planning it and was given no part in discussions or decisions."

2500|$|Petiot {{failed to}} keep a low profile. The Gestapo {{eventually}} found out about him and, by April 1943, they had heard <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> [...] "route" [...] for the escape of wanted persons, which they assumed {{was part of the}} Resistance. Gestapo agent Robert Jodkum forced prisoner Yvan Dreyfus to approach the supposed network, but Dreyfus simply vanished. A later informer successfully infiltrated the operation, and the Gestapo arrested Fourrier, Pintard, and Nézondet. Under torture, they confessed that [...] "Dr. Eugène" [...] was Marcel Petiot. Nézondet was later released, but three others spent eight months in prison, suspected of helping Jews to escape. Even under torture, they did not identify any other members of the Resistance because they knew of none. The Gestapo released the three men in January 1944.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{packaged}} as a gatefold sleeve designed {{and illustrated by}} Roger Dean, who had also designed the art for Fragile, Close to the Edge (1972), and the band's first live album, Yessongs (1973). Each of them carried a loose narrative thread that Dean did not continue for Tales from Topographic Oceans. The album's design was discussed during an in-depth conversation Dean and Anderson had in 1973 during the band's flight from London to Tokyo via Anchorage, Alaska, during the Close to the Edge tour. Prior to the flight, Dean had completed the front cover to The View Over Atlantis (1969) by John Mitchell, and [...] "the wives and girlfriends made a cake ... and we all had some. I {{have no idea what}} was in it but from London to Anchorage, I was stoned ... But from Anchorage to Tokyo, I couldn't stop talking. And I was telling Jon <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> book, about patterns in the landscape and dragon lines, and we were flying hour after hour after hour over the most amazing landscapes ... So the idea of ... a sort of magical landscape and an alternative landscape ... that informed everything: the album cover, the merchandising, the stage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following his {{appearance}} in the second season, Dane returned to the series in this episode. According to Dane, he was originally hired by the series producers in order to film one episode, but was ultimately asked to return. [...] "As far as I know, I was doing one episode. That's what I signed up for. But because of who the character was, {{there was a lot}} of room for him to come back. I got real lucky, they invited me back." [...] When offered the series regular position, Dane was not aware of the character's future on the show, noting the boldness of the character's introduction in the previous season, by contrast to his first {{appearance in the}} third season. Fellow cast member Pompeo offered her insight on Sloan's reintroduction, noting that the inevitability of the character's return was due to his overwhelming popularity, mainly among the female audience, who immediately responded to the concept of the character. Dane only makes a short, uncredited appearance in the episode, seeing his naked character exiting a steamy bathroom. The scene has become one of the most iconic of the series. Dane offered his outlook on the scene, [...] "It was a spectacular entrance. It was <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> brand new towel, which had a hard time staying together. Every time I put it together and let my hands go, it was almost like throwing caution to the wind." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his autobiography, Twain writes further of Captain Sellers' use of [...] "Mark Twain": I was a cub pilot on the Mississippi River then, {{and one day}} I wrote a {{rude and}} crude satire which was leveled at Captain Isaiah Sellers, the oldest {{steamboat}} pilot on the Mississippi River, and the most respected, esteemed, and revered. For many years he had occasionally written brief paragraphs concerning {{the river and the}} changes which it had undergone under his observation during fifty years, and had signed these paragraphs [...] "Mark Twain" [...] and published them in the St. Louis and New Orleans journals. In my satire I made rude game of his reminiscences. It was a shabby poor performance, but I didn't know it, and the pilots didn't know it. The pilots thought it was brilliant. They were jealous of Sellers, because when the gray-heads among them pleased their vanity by detailing in the hearing of the younger craftsmen marvels which they had seen in the long ago on the river, Sellers was always likely to step in at the psychological moment and snuff them out with wonders of his own which made their small marvels look pale and sick. However, I have told <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> in [...] "Old Times on the Mississippi." [...] The pilots handed my extravagant satire to a river reporter, and it was published in the New Orleans True Delta. That poor old Captain Sellers was deeply wounded. He had never been held up to ridicule before; he was sensitive, and he never got over the hurt which I had wantonly and stupidly inflicted upon his dignity. I was proud of my performance for a while, and considered it quite wonderful, but I have changed my opinion of it long ago. Sellers never published another paragraph nor ever used his nom de guerre again.|$|E
