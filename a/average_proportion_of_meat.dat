30|$|Some {{portions}} of Apollo FAN samples {{have been reported}} to consist of high abundances of plagioclase (> 98 %; e.g., Dixon and Papike 1975; James et al. 1989, 1991; McGee 1993; Warren 1990). Moreover, some FAN samples are modally heterogeneous because they contain several lithologies (e.g., 60025 in Floss et al. 1998). The <b>average</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> plagioclase is approximately 96 % for large FAN rocks (mass > 1  g), although the mass-weighted average may be biased by Apollo FAN sample 60015 (Wieczorek et al. 2006). The Apollo FAN sample 60015 is the largest anorthosite, with nearly half the mass of the total FAN and the highest abundances of plagioclase (approximately 99 %) among FAN. Therefore, excluding 60015, the mass-weighted <b>average</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> plagioclase in FAN samples drops to 93 % (Wieczorek et al. 2006). We reinvestigate the mineralogy and petrology of 60015 and compare the results with those of pure anorthosites available from the Dhofar 489 group.|$|R
