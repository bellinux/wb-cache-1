40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{influence}} of client gender and auditor gender on auditorsâ€™ judgments. In an experimental task, a client offers unverified explanations {{as to why the}} auditorâ€™s initial proposed <b>adjusting</b> <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> (AJE) to lower the inventory value should not be recorded. The design includes one randomly manipulated variable (client gender: male or female) and one measured variable (auditor gender: male or female). The dependent variable assesses {{the influence of}} the clientâ€™s explanations on the auditorâ€™s final proposed AJE recommendation. The results indicate that both male and female auditors exhibited a male-favorability; that is, they were persuaded more by a male than female client to change their initial AJE recommendation. Furthermore, female auditors were more influenced by a male client and less influenced by a female client than male auditors. Using an expert panelâ€™s consensus opinion as a benchmark for the "best" solution, the male auditors were more accurate than female auditors, irrespective of client gender. Additional research will aid in substantiating, determining the limits, and generalizing the findings. audit judgment;auditor gender;client gender;gender stereotypes;risk taking;selectivity hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|Two {{alternative}} approaches {{are used in}} audit practice to make quantitative materiality assessments about proposed audit adjustments. The cumulative approach (often called the “iron curtain ” approach in practice) compares to net income {{the total amount of}} misstatement existing {{at the end of the}} current period, while the current-period approach (often called the “rollover” approach in practice) compares to net income the amount of misstatement added in the current period. Depending on the specific context, either of these approaches could make a misstatement appear more material quantitatively. The Panel on Audit Effectiveness and the SEC have expressed concern that these alternative materiality approaches could affect auditor judgments, but no research has investigated this question. We report the results of an experiment in which 234 audit managers and partners from one Big 4 firm completed eight cases that required them to determine whether the final outcome of an audit would be to book or waive a proposed <b>adjusting</b> <b>journal</b> <b>entry.</b> We manipulated materiality approach between auditors by providing auditors with either the current-period or cumulative formats used at their firm to summarize proposed audit adjustments. Results indicated a robust and often unintentional effect of materiality approach on auditors ’ adjustment decisions, regardless of whether misstatements were large or small, subjective or objective, and income increasing or income decreasing...|$|E

Specifically, GAO found lack of approval for payments to vendors, inaccurate classification of transactions in the general ledger, lack of supporting documents for <b>adjusting</b> <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> made by the foundation's accounting firm, incomplete personnel files, and lack of congressional reports for fiscal year 2000. The leadership of the Congressional Award Foundation changed {{near the end of}} the fiscal year 2001, and this transition may have contributed to the weaknesses found during GAO's audit. Since this transition, the foundation has established the executive position of the Director of Finance and Administration to oversee daily financial and administrative operations. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{accounting}}/accountancy, <b>adjusting</b> <b>entries</b> are <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> {{usually made}} {{at the end of}} an accounting period to allocate income and expenditure to the period in which they actually occurred. The revenue recognition principle is the basis of making adjusting entries that pertain to unearned and accrued revenues under accrual-basis accounting.

5000|$|<b>Journal</b> <b>entries</b> are an {{important}} part of accountancy.A <b>journal</b> <b>entry,</b> in accounting, is the logging of a transaction into accounting journal items. The <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> can consist of several recordings, each of which is either a debit or a credit. The total of the debits must equal the total of the credits or the <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> is said to be [...] "unbalanced". <b>Journal</b> <b>entries</b> can record unique items or recurring items such as depreciation or bond amortization. In accounting software, <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> are usually entered using a separate module from accounts payable, which typically has its own subledger that indirectly affects the general ledger. As a result, <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> directly change the account balances on the general ledger.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} how the auditing of <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> can detect and prevent financial statement fraud. Financial statement fraud occurs when an intentional act causes financial statements to be materially misstated. Although {{it is not}} a new phenomenon, financial statement fraud has attracted much publicity in the wake of numerous cases of financial malfeasance (e. g. ENRON, WorldCom). Existing literature has provided limited empirical evidence on the link between auditing <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> and financial statement fraud. The lack of evidence contrasts sharply with the responsibility of auditors to test the appropriateness of <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> recorded in a general ledger. It becomes more pronounced when considering that <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> pose a high risk of financial statement fraud, as the case of WorldCom has demonstrated. It is further exacerbated given that fraud results in considerable costs to a number of parties, for example: auditors may be exposed to litigation; investors may experience negative stock returns; and, capital markets may suffer from reduced liquidity. Motivated by these considerations, the thesis adopts the tenets of design-science research in order to develop three quantitative models for auditing <b>journal</b> <b>entries.</b> It first employs self-organizing map and extreme value theory to design the models as constructs. Subsequently, it codes the constructs in MATLAB to build functioning instantiations; and finally, it evaluates the instantiations by conducting a series of experiments on an accounting dataset containing <b>journal</b> <b>entries.</b> The contribution of the thesis lies in the proposed models and their potential applications in accounting. The first model can assist management to monitor the processing of <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> as well as to assess the accuracy of financial statements. The second model can detect novel <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> that differ from legitimate <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> {{to such an extent that}} they could be ‘suspicious’. The third model can identify those <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> that have both a very low probability of occurring and a monetary amount large enough to materially misstate financial statements. The thesis has a novelty value in that it investigates financial statement fraud from the unexplored perspective of <b>journal</b> <b>entries.</b> The thesis can lead to concrete practical applications in accounting, as the models can be implemented as a Computerised Assisted Audit Technique. This potentiality can be the focal point of additional research...|$|R

50|$|Folio Number: Every page of {{a journal}} is numbered. This number {{is known as a}} folio number. The folio number is used as a cross {{reference}} between the journal and the ledger accounts. The use of folio numbers makes it easy to refer back from the ledger account to the <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> or forward from the <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> to the ledger account. In addition, folio numbers are a check that all <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> have been recorded in the ledger system.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} report is a narrative on my encounter with sport psychology. I used the metaphors of “touring” and “journal” {{to guide the}} construction of this narrative. Before embarking on my tour with sport psychology, I introduced myself as researcher (chapter 2, <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> I) and stated the research problem, question and goal(s) (chapter 3, <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> II). I then went on a tour with sport psychology. I visited a sport psychology museum {{to learn more about}} the history of sport psychology (chapter 4, <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> III) and a sport psychology library {{to learn more about the}} field of sport psychology (chapter 5, <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> IV). I also attended a sport psychology conference to become better acquainted with postgraduate sport psychology training in Psychology Departments (chapter 6, <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> V). I also visited a sport psychology department at a university in Australia, to witness the delivery of a postgraduate training programme in sport psychology (chapter 7, <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> VI), as well as a sport centre in South Africa and a sport institute in Australia, to see how and the extent to which sport psychology was practised (chapter 8, <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> VII). After my tour with sport psychology I took what I had learnt and adapted the MA (Counselling Psychology) programme at the University of Pretoria, South Africa. This led to the programme having three core modules and two elective modules. The core modules are fundamental psychology, counselling psychology and career psychology. The elective modules are: community psychology and sport psychology. The sport psychology module consists of the following courses: sport psychology, sport management, sport sociology and exercise psychology. The Professional Board of Psychology at the Health Professions Council of South Africa approved this module at the end of 2003 (chapter 9, <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> VIII). Finally, I also looked at the influence of my experience with sport psychology on my identity as a psychologist (chapter 10, <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> IX).
