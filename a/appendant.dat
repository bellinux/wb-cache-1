5|$|The Order of the	White Shrine of Jerusalem Like {{the members}} of the Masonic Lodge and other <b>appendant</b> bodies, members of the White Shrine must profess a belief in a Supreme Being. However, the White Shrine goes one step further, {{requiring}} members to profess a belief in Jesus Christ as the Savior and Redeemer of the World. Membership is open to female relatives of Master Masons or members either active for three years or majority of the International Order of Rainbow for Girls or Job's Daughters International who have attained of eighteen (18) years of age.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{there were}} three manors within the parish; Ditton Manor, with the <b>appendant</b> Brampton Manor, and Sifletone, {{all of which were}} owned by the Bishop of Bayeux at this time. The Bishop of Bayeaux was Odo, Earl of Kent, half brother of William the Conqueror. In 1082, after it was {{discovered}} that Odo planned a military expedition to Italy, he was imprisoned and his estates (including Ditton, Brampton and Sifletone) were confiscated to the Crown. Following this, Ditton Manor appears to have been held by the Clares, earls of Gloucester, by a family who assumed their surname from Ditton. Likewise, Sifletone was confiscated and went to another family who took their surname from it.|$|E

40|$|In the {{presented}} {{research work}} sulfonamide, acetamide and oxadiazole functionalities were incorporated as <b>appendants</b> of piperidine. The {{aim of this}} work was to synthesize new compounds exhibiting diverse and improved pharmacological potential in search of new drug contenders with enhanced activity, might be helpful in controlling many degenerative diseases. The present work was accomplished to synthesize 149 compounds having specific structural as well as chemical properties in six different schemes. The synthesized derivatives were evaluated for their enzyme inhibitory potential against different enzymes, that is, acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase and lipoxygenase; antibacterial activity using different bacterial strains of gram positive and negative bacteria; and moreover molecular docking studies was also performed for the potent derivatives against AChE & BChE. The scheme- 1 {{was based on the}} synthesis of twenty different N-substituted derivatives including N-alkyl-N-(piperidin- 1 -yl) benzenesulfonamide (5 a-f) and Naryl- 2 -[(phenylsulfonyl) (piperidin- 1 -yl) amino]acetamide (7 a-n) from 1 -amino piperidine. In scheme- 2 ten 2 -O-substituted derivatives (9 a-j) of 1 -[(3, 5 -dichloro- 2 - hydroxyphenyl) sulfonyl] piperidine (8) were synthesized by reacting 2 - bromoacetamide electrophiles with 8. In scheme- 3, 4 -(Piperidine- 1 -yl) aniline was subjected to react with different sulfonyl chlorides (1 a-k) to form eleven alkyl/aralkyl sulfonamides (10 a-k) which were substituted with ethyl iodide to generate eleven newfangled N-ethyl substituted sulfonamides (11 aâ€“k). Schemes- 4 & 5 were based on Ethyl isonipecotate as main piperidine based reactant which then treated differently to generate series of novel cholinesterase inhibitors. In series 4 Ethyl isonipecotate was firstly converted to ethyl 1 -(phenylsulfonyl) piperidine- 4 -carboxylate (12) which then reacted with NH 2 -NH 2 (hydrated) to form 1 -(phenylsulfonyl) piperidin- 4 - carbohydrazide (13). By reacting 13 with different sulfonyl chlorides, fourteen N'-(1 - (phenylsulfonyl) piperidine- 4 -carbonyl) sulfonohydrazide derivatives (14 a-n) were synthesized. 5 -(1 -(Phenylsulfonyl) piperidin- 4 -yl) - 1, 3, 4 -Oxadiazol- 2 -thiol (15) was synthesized by refluxing carbohydrazide 13 with CS 2 /KOH in ethanol. This 1, 3, 4 - Oxadiazole 15, was processed for the synthesis of S-substituted 1, 3, 4 -Oxadiazol derivatives (16 a-v) (Scheme- 5). This synthetic scheme involved the stirring of alkyl/aralkyl halides with 15 in the presence of NaH/DMF. The eleven aralkyl/aryl carboxylic acids (18 a-k) were converted into corresponding ethyl esters (19 a-k) through esterification with ethanol in the presence of small amount of conc. H 2 SO 4 as catalyst. Ethyl esters (19 a-k) were further converted into carbohydrazides (20 a-k) by stirring with hydrazine in methanol. The eleven 1, 3, 4 -Oxadiazoles (21 a-k) were synthesized by refluxing carbohydrazides with CS 2 /KOH in ethanol (Scheme- 6). This scheme also included the formation of an electrophile, 22, by stirring of piperidine with 4 -(bromomethyl) benzenesulfonyl chloride in aqueous basic medium and then stirring of 22 with eleven 5 -substituted- 1, 3, 4 -Oxadiazol- 2 -thiols in NaH/DMF to synthesize 5 -aralkyl/aryl- 1, 3, 4 -Oxadiazol- 2 -yl 4 -(piperidin- 1 -ylsulfonyl) benzyl sulfide (23 a-k). All the compounds were corroborated through spectral analysis including 1 H-NMR, IR and EI-MS. Scheme 1 - 4 & 6 derivatives were screened against AChE, BChE & LOX enzyme and showed excellent to moderate inhibitory potential and most potent inhibitors from each of above mentioned schemes were docked with AChE & BChE proteins to establish the binding models for structure activity relationship. Scheme- 5 derivatives were screened against both gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains i. e. B. subtilis (+), S. aureus (+) and S. sonnei (-), E. coli (-), P. aeruginosa (-) and S. typhi (-) using Ampicillin and Ciprofloxacin as reference standard. All compounds showed varying degree of antimicrobial activity...|$|R

25|$|Pectins, {{also known}} as pectic polysaccharides, are rich in galacturonic acid. Several {{distinct}} polysaccharides have been identified and characterised within the pectic group. Homogalacturonans are linear chains of α-(1–4)-linked D-galacturonic acid. Substituted galacturonans are characterized {{by the presence of}} saccharide <b>appendant</b> residues (such as D-xylose or D-apiose in the respective cases of xylogalacturonan and apiogalacturonan) branching from a backbone of D-galacturonic acid residues. Rhamnogalacturonan I pectins (RG-I) contain a backbone of the repeating disaccharide: 4)-α-D-galacturonic acid-(1,2)-α-L-rhamnose-(1. From many of the rhamnose residues, sidechains of various neutral sugars branch off. The neutral sugars are mainly D-galactose, L-arabinose and D-xylose, with the types and proportions of neutral sugars varying with the origin of pectin.|$|E

2500|$|In {{anticipation}} of the association's 100th anniversary in 2010, the memorial underwent significant repair. The GNWMMA Board of Directors approved a significant expenditure of funds to make these changes. The Main Assembly Hall was renamed the Grand Masonic Hall, and restored to its original condition. The [...] "Grand Masonic Hall" [...] was also enclosed with glass and doors, permitting it {{to be used as}} a conference center. Air conditioning was installed throughout the building, elevators reaching to the first floor added, the roof over the second and third floors repaired, the memorial made even more handicap-accessible, the main front granite steps removed and reset, and a security and surveillance system installed. The hallways around the Grand Masonic Hall on the first floor were repainted, new lighting installed, and a new photo exhibit ("The Golden Age of Masonic Architecture") placed on the walls. The room containing the historic replica of the Alexandria-Washington Lodge No. 22 meeting room was also renovated and updated, to better display the Washingtoniana in the room. A new exhibit, [...] "The Form and Function of American Freemasonry," [...] was added to the first floor to help explain what Freemasonry is and what its symbols represent. Also planned were an exhibit (intended for the Grotto's third floor room) about Freemasonry's <b>appendant</b> bodies and a history of the memorial and its relationship with the city of Alexandria.|$|E
2500|$|At the GWMNMA's {{annual meeting}} in February 1947, the Alexandria-Washington Lodge Replica Room was dedicated. [...] The {{association}} also voted to allot {{one of the rooms}} in the unfinished tower to the Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm (also known as [...] "the Grotto"), which had raised $25,000 to finish the room. The Supreme Council, Scottish Rite (Southern Jurisdiction, USA) donated $100,000 to finish the north lodge room on the second floor and dedicate it to Cryptic Masonry. [...] Prior to this donation, the association was unsure whether <b>appendant</b> bodies of Freemasonry should be allowed to occupy rooms in the memorial. [...] The Southern Jurisdiction's donation effectively ended this debate. It also encouraged many Grand Lodges (state organizations) of Masonry to make large donations to the memorial, bringing new life to the memorial's fund-raising efforts. [...] The association also agreed to expend funds to build a kitchen and dining room, hang bronze doors on the first floor, and install bronze grillwork for the heating and ventilation system on the first floor. Two other major decisions were made in 1947 as well. [...] Long-time memorial architect Harvey W. Corbett presented his plans for completing the memorial's interior, and sculptor Bryant Baker discussed his plans for a life-size statue of George Washington to adorn the memorial hall. The Order of DeMolay, the young men's affiliate of Freemasonry, had won the association's approval for a campaign to raise money for a bronze statue of George Washington back in 1934. Baker proposed a marble statue that would cost $50,000 to $60,000 and stand on a pedestal worth $7,000 to $10,000. The association also began work on its first elevator. The Otis Elevator Company was awarded this contract on October 23, 1947. [...] Designed to fit into the southeast stairwell, the company overcame the 7.5 degree incline of the stairwell by putting wheels {{on one side of the}} elevator car to keep it vertical.

2500|$|The tower {{contains}} the third through ninth floors. The tower {{is divided into}} four sections, each smaller in circumference than the one below. There are two floors in the first, second, and third section, but only one floor in the fourth section. The third floor contains exhibits about the history, charitable activities, and socializing that various Masonic bodies engage in. The third floor used to be solely dedicated to the Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm ("the Grotto"), and housed the organization's archives. But beginning in February 2012, the third floor was renovated to contain displays about other <b>appendant</b> bodies as well (although the Grotto's display in the room remains by far the largest). The fourth floor {{contains the}} George Washington Museum, which is maintained with funding from the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite of the Southern and Northern Jurisdictions of the United States. The Donald De Lue bronze statue of Washington {{is located in the}} museum, which also contains many items used or owned by Washington. The fourth floor is double the height of the third floor, with a mezzanine that contains additional exhibits. The fifth floor is the same height as the third floor, and is dedicated to exhibits and symbols important to Royal Arch Masonry. This floor is in the Egyptian Revival and ancient Hebraic architectural styles. It also contains a replica of the ark of the covenant (curtains automatically open and close to reveal the replica to visitors). The sixth floor contains the Memorial Library. This floor is double the height of the fifth floor, and like the fourth floor contains a mezzanine. The seventh floor is the same height as the third and fifth floors, and is dedicated to Cryptic Masonry (the second part of the York Rite system of Masonic degrees). The room is a symbolic replica of the legendary crypt beneath the Temple of Solomon where secrets and treasures were kept. It also contains murals which depict key events mentioned in Cryptic initiation rituals (such as the murder of Hiram Abiff, architect of Solomon's Temple). The eighth floor is the same height as the seventh floor, and contains a chapel dedicated to the Knights Templar. It is in the early French Gothic architectural style. Like the fourth and sixth floors, it is double the height of the third and fifth floors but it lacks the mezzanine found on the fourth and sixth floors. The stained glass windows in this chapel depict four scenes from the Christian Bible: Jesus healing the blind, the Sermon on the Mount, the crucifixion of Jesus, and the ascension of Jesus into heaven. The ninth floor is the same height as the third, fifth, and seventh floors, and contains both the Tall Cedars Room and the observation platform. [...] The Tall Cedars of Lebanon is a social group for Master Masons, and their room on the ninth floor depicts King Solomon's throne room and symbols important to this group. The observation platform, which rings the exterior of the ninth floor, is accessible only from this room.|$|E

60|$|First, if {{that light}} be (as is affirmed, Diopt. cap. 1. §. 8.) not so {{properly}} a motion, as an action or propension to motion, I cannot conceive how {{the eye can}} come to be sensible of the verticity of a Globule, which is generated in a drop of Rain, perhaps a mile off from it. For that Globule is not carry'd to the eye according to his formerly recited Principle; and if not so, I cannot conceive how it can communicate its rotation, or circular motion {{to the line of}} the Globules between the drop and the eye. It cannot be by means of every ones turning the next before him; for if so, then onely all the Globules that are in the odd places must be turned the same way with the first, namely, the 3. 5. 7. 9. 11, &c. but all the Globules interposited between them in the even places; namely, the 2. 4. 6. 8. 10. &c. must be the quite contrary, whence, according to the Cartesian Hypothesis, there must be no distinct colour generated, but a confusion. Next, since the Cartesian Globuli are suppos'd (Principiorum Philosoph. Part. 3. §. 86.) to be each of them continually in motion about their centers, I cannot conceive how the eye is able to distinguish this new generated motion from their former inherent one, if I may so call that other wherewith they are mov'd or turbinated, from some other cause than refraction. And thirdly, I cannot conceive how these motions should not happen sometimes to oppose each other, and then, in stead of a rotation, there would be nothing but a direct motion generated, and consequently no colour. And fourthly, I cannot conceive, how by the Cartesian Hypothesis it is possible to give any plausible reason {{of the nature of the}} Colours generated in the thin laminæ of these our Microscopical Observations; for in many of these, the refracting and reflecting surfaces are parallel to each other, and consequently no rotation can be generated, nor is there any necessity of a shadow or termination of the bright Rays, such as is suppos'd (Chap. 8. §. 5. Et præterea observavi umbram quoque, aut limitationem luminis requiri: and Chap. 8. §. 9.) to be necessary to the generation of any distinct colours; Besides that, here is oftentimes one colour generated without any of the other <b>appendant</b> ones, which cannot be by the Cartesian Hypothesis.|$|E
