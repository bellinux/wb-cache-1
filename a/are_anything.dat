Their ears reach back to half the length of their body when at rest. It also has a globular shaped muzzle and elongated nostrils. Its whole body is 98 millimeters long. The forearms of the bat <b>are</b> <b>anything</b> from 39 to 48 millimeters, the tail can be about 46 millimeters, and the hind foot can be about 11 millimeters.|$|E

25|$|On {{the lower}} slopes of Devil's Peak, above Groote Schuur Hospital, an animal camp bequeathed to the City of Cape Town by Cecil John Rhodes {{has been used}} in recent years as part of the Quagga Project. The quaggas used to roam the Cape Peninsula, the Karoo and the Free State in large numbers, but were hunted to {{extinction}} during the early 1800s. The last quagga died in an Amsterdam zoo in 1883. In 1987 a project was launched by Reinhold Rau to back-breed the quagga, after it had been established, using mitochondrial DNA obtained from museum specimens, that the quagga was closely related to the plains zebra, and on 20 January 2005 a foal considered to be the first quagga-like individual because of a visible reduced striping was born. These quagga-like zebras are officially known as Rau quaggas, as no one can be certain that they <b>are</b> <b>anything</b> more than quagga look-alikes. The animal camp above Groote Schuur Hospital has several good looking Rau quaggas, but they are unfortunately not easily seen except from within the game camp, which is quite large and undulating, and the animals are few. The animal camp is not open to the public.|$|E
25|$|In {{respect to}} the other {{non-lethal}} weapon effects from an IND detonated {{on or near the}} surface, the detonation's blast wave would likely produce a momentary electric grid blackout due to the loss of a large portion of a city's electrical equipment drawing power/electrical load, while the electromagnetic pulse(EMP) from a surface/ground-burst explosion would cause little damage outside the blast area, so cell phone towers that survive the blast should be capable of carrying communications. Although if communications during the 9/11 attacks or after a major hurricane <b>are</b> <b>anything</b> to go by, and the cell phone network towers survive, the service would be overloaded(a Mass call event) and thereby made useless soon after; however, if prior arrangements between the cell network and emergency responders are made to give them priority and bar access to all other individuals, then it may be an effective service. However, as Civil defense(CD) shelters, as depicted in the film, were stocked for such an eventuality, they contained amongst other things, at least one CDV-715 radiation survey meter and a CD emergency radio receiver which would respectively be used to facilitate a safe delayed evacuation, regardless of outside help and if communications continued, inform them of the outside situation as it developed.|$|E

I have found this game obsessively fascinating—and the graphics and player interface are superb". He called it the [...] "Star Wars of science fiction games. Brilliantly designed and programmed ... the standard against which all other space-exploration games must be measured". Compute! listed it in May 1988 as one of [...] "Our Favorite Games", stating that [...] "Starflight captures the feel of a certain type of science fiction ... the game can take hundreds of hours to play fully, yet those hours <b>are</b> <b>anything</b> but boring".|$|E

500|$|The oration also {{moves away}} from the {{religious}} ideology of the Tetrarchy, with its focus on twin dynasties of Jupiter and Hercules. Instead, the orator proclaims that Constantine experienced a divine vision of Apollo and Victory granting him laurel wreaths of health and a long reign. In the likeness of Apollo Constantine recognized himself as the saving figure to whom would be granted [...] "rule of the whole world", as the poet Virgil had once foretold. The oration's religious shift is paralleled by a similar shift in Constantine's coinage. In his early reign, the coinage of Constantine advertised Mars as his patron. From 310AD on, Mars was replaced by Sol Invictus, a god conventionally identified with Apollo. There is little reason to believe that either the dynastic connection or the divine vision <b>are</b> <b>anything</b> other than fiction, but their proclamation strengthened Constantine's claims to legitimacy and increased his popularity among the citizens of Gaul.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "All About That Bass" [...] became {{a subject of}} {{controversy}} among several music critics who felt that the song did not promote a positive body image as Trainor intended. The singer was accused of anti-feminism and shaming thin women in the song, namely in the lyrics [...] "bringing booty back / Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches that," [...] and [...] "Yeah my mama she told me don't worry about your size / She says, 'Boys like a little more booty to hold at night.'" [...] The former lyric was however developed by Kadish and not Trainor. In a publication by The Daily Telegraph, Olivia O'Niell analyzed, [...] "If the song's 908,000 likes on YouTube and Meghan's 90,000 followers on Twitter <b>are</b> <b>anything</b> to go by, {{it would seem that}} the message most people are taking away from the hit is a positive one". However, O'Niell went on to highlight that the lyrics [...] "have outraged some listeners, with YouTube comments criticizing Trainor for her 'thinly veiled hypocrisy'".|$|E
500|$|Jenny Sawyer {{wrote in}} Christian Science Monitor on 25 July 2007 that the books {{represent}} a [...] "disturbing trend in commercial storytelling and Western society" [...] in that stories [...] "moral center [...] {{have all but}} vanished from much of today's pop culture... after 10 years, 4,195 pages, and over 375 million copies, J. K. Rowling's towering achievement lacks the cornerstone of almost all great children's literature: the hero's moral journey". Harry Potter, Sawyer argues, neither faces a [...] "moral struggle" [...] nor undergoes any ethical growth, and is thus [...] "no guide in circumstances in which right and wrong <b>are</b> <b>anything</b> less than black and white". In contrast Emily Griesinger described Harry's first passage through to Platform 9¾ as an application of faith and hope, and his encounter with the Sorting Hat as {{the first of many}} in which Harry is shaped by the choices he makes. She also noted the [...] "deeper magic" [...] by which the self-sacrifice of Harry's mother protects the boy throughout the series, and which the power-hungry Voldemort fails to understand.|$|E

He exercised tight control over the bureaucracy {{as well as his}} cabinet, stating: [...] "Do not imagine that my Ministers <b>are</b> <b>anything</b> but my Secretaries. I put them in their offices to listen and report, and nothing more." [...] His supporters were rewarded with positions within the state apparatus, and anyone he deemed a threat was purged. Opposition newspapers were burned in public squares. Rosas created an elaborate cult of personality, presenting himself as an almighty and fatherlike figure who protected the people. His portraits were carried in street demonstrations and placed on church altars to be venerated. Rosismo was no longer a mere faction within the Federalist ranks; it had become a political movement. As early as 1829, Rosas had confided to an Uruguayan diplomatic envoy: [...] "I tell you I am not a Federalist, and I have never belonged to that party." [...] During his governorship, he still claimed to have favoured Federalism against Unitarianism, although in practice Federalism had by that time been subsumed into the Rosismo movement.|$|E
500|$|Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine {{criticized the}} music videos for {{the songs on}} B'Day Anthology Video Album, writing that [...] "none of them <b>are</b> <b>anything</b> special, though most will please narrow-minded fans". To {{celebrate}} the album's tenth year anniversary, Billboard published [...] "Beyoncé's Best Fashion Moments from Her Decade-Old 'B'Day Anthology Video Album'", the list in which Billboard editor Da'Shan Smith commented on ten best outfits Beyoncé wore in the music videos, on April 3, 2017, and stated: [...] "The project has delivered audiences some of the singer's most iconic looks. In every frame she appears in, Beyoncé oozes a radiant confidence, wearing stunning outfits and costumes to match. Here is the project's ten best looks – from House of Deréon signatures to impromptu costume designs and haute couture get ups." [...] The same day, Vibe published a list in which Smith ranked all thirteen music videos from the worst to the best; he stated: [...] "B'Day Video Anthology Album must be heralded as an important pop culture artifact. As expressed before, it's the birther of Beyoncé's passion for providing fans visual sequences they need to tell an album’s story. Imagine a B'Day without its Anthology—although the go-go and funk infused tracks already made an impression upon audio listens only, the visuals made the record pop to life." ...|$|E
500|$|Releases {{from major}} studios – such as The Big Lebowski (1998), which was {{distributed}} by Universal Studios – can become cult films when they fail {{at the box}} office and develop a cult following through reissues, such as midnight movies, festivals, and home video. [...] Hollywood films, due to their nature, are more likely to attract this kind of attention, which leads to a mainstreaming effect of cult culture. [...] With major studios behind them, even financially unsuccessful films can be re-released multiple times, which plays into a trend to capture audiences through repetitious reissues. [...] The constant use of profanity and drugs in otherwise mainstream, Hollywood films, such as The Big Lebowski, can alienate critics and audiences yet lead to a large cult following among more open-minded demographics not often associated with cult films, such as Wall Street bankers and professional soldiers. [...] Thus, even comparatively mainstream films can satisfy the traditional demands of a cult film, perceived by fans as transgressive, niche, and uncommercial. [...] Discussing his reputation for making cult films, Bollywood director Anurag Kashyap said, [...] "I didn't set out to make cult films. I wanted to make box-office hits." [...] Writing in Cult Cinema, academics Ernest Mathijs and Jamie Sexton state that this acceptance of mainstream culture and commercialism is not out of character, as cult audiences have a more complex relationship to these concepts: they are more opposed to mainstream values and excessive commercialism than they <b>are</b> <b>anything</b> else.|$|E
