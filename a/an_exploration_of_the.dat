5|$|Following the {{legislative}} session, Beshear began to address his agenda related to energy production. In April 2008, {{he announced that}} he would divide the state's Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet to form a new Energy and Environmental Cabinet. The move essentially reversed the consolidation of Environmental, Public Protection, and Labor Cabinets effected under Beshear's predecessor, Ernie Fletcher. Later in the year, Beshear released what he called the state's first-ever comprehensive energy plan. The plan called for expansion of solar, wind, and biomass energy generation, as well as more speculative ventures such as coal gasification and carbon capture and sequestration. Although the plan called for <b>an</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use of nuclear power, Beshear stopped short of advocating an end to the state's ban on the construction of nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|Marcel Pagnol's 1953 film Manon des Sources {{was four}} hours long, and {{subsequently}} cut by its distributor. The end result left Pagnol dissatisfied, {{and led him}} to retell the story as a novel. The {{first part of the}} novel, titled Jean de Florette, was <b>an</b> <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> background for the film; a prequel of sorts. Together the two volumes made up the work Pagnol called L'Eau des collines (The Water of the Hills). Berri came across Pagnol's book by chance in a hotel room, and was captivated by it. He decided that in order to do the story justice it had to be made in two parts.|$|E
