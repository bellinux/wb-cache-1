Donna entered the series as a staff nurse, characterised as a wild-child with a chaotic personal life. During her tenure, she grew to take her work more seriously, becoming a ward sister <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> more personal responsibilities by adopting her half-niece Mia (Jada Wallace-Mitchell). A tart with a heart character, Donna had many romantic liaisons with her colleagues, including a one-night stand with midwife Mickie Hendrie (Kelly Adams).

5|$|In 1871, Stevenson {{defeated}} incumbent Thomas C. McCreery for {{his seat}} in the U.S. Senate after criticizing McCreery for allegedly supporting the appointment of Stephen G. Burbridge, who was hated by most Kentuckians, to a federal position. In the Senate, he opposed internal improvements and defended a constructionist view of the constitution, resisting efforts to expand the powers expressly granted in that document. Beginning in late 1873, Stephenson functioned as the first chairman (later called floor leader) of the Senate Democratic caucus. He did not seek reelection in 1877, returning to his law practice <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> future Kentucky Governor William Goebel as a law partner. He chaired the 1880 Democratic National Convention and {{was elected president of}} the American Bar Association in 1884. He died in Covington on August 10, 1886, and was buried in Spring Grove Cemetery at Cincinnati, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Philip and {{his army}} joined {{his son in}} 338 BC, and they marched south through Thermopylae, taking it after {{stubborn}} resistance from its Theban garrison. They went on to occupy the city of Elatea, only a few days' march from both Athens and Thebes. The Athenians, led by Demosthenes, voted to seek alliance with Thebes against Macedonia. Both Athens and Philip sent embassies to win Thebes' favour, but Athens won the contest. Philip marched on Amphissa (ostensibly acting on {{the request of the}} Amphictyonic League), capturing the mercenaries sent there by Demosthenes <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> the city's surrender. Philip then returned to Elatea, sending a final offer of peace to Athens and Thebes, who both rejected it.|$|E

There are approximately 300 students on roll, including a large sixth form making up around half of the school.

5|$|When the deanship of the {{law school}} came open in 1929, Macdonald agonized over whether he should seek the job. He {{apparently}} had strong support from several members of the university's board of governors. At the same time however, he was increasingly drawn to politics <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> the deanship would mean postponing his political ambitions indefinitely. In the end, the job was offered to Sidney Smith, another prominent Canadian academic who accepted on condition that Macdonald remain at the school. Macdonald did stay, but only for one more year. In 1930, he resigned so he would be free to enter politics.|$|E
5|$|As {{in many of}} his {{previous}} pursuits, Burnet set an ambitious agenda for himself but ran into difficulties. He saw the Academy as the peak lobby group {{of the scientific community}} and their main liaison with government and industry. He tried to lift its profile and use it to persuade the political and industrial leadership to invest more in science. He also wanted to use the Academy to increase the involvement of the eminent scientists of Australia in training and motivating the next generation, but these initiatives were not successful {{due to a lack of}} concrete method. Most controversially, he tried to change the membership criteria of the Academy. He wanted to stop the Royal Society from operating in Australia <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> new Australian members. He reasoned that the Australian Academy would not be strong if the Royal Society would be able to compete with it, and he felt that if Australian scientists were allowed to possess membership of the both bodies, the more established Royal Society would make the Australian Academy look poor in comparison. Questions were raised over the existing dual members—such as Burnet—being able to maintain their status and the hypocrisy thereby entailed in Burnet's nationalistic proposal, and it was defeated heavily.|$|E

Ged patches his boat and escapes the island, pursuing the creature into the East Reach. On the island of Iffish he meets his friend Vetch, who insists on joining him. They journey east far beyond the last known lands before they finally come upon the shadow. Here Ged realizes that the shadow has always been a part of his own spirit. Naming it with his own name, he merges with the shadow creature, understanding <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> it as part of himself, and thus healing himself.|$|E

5|$|Miller was {{discharged}} from the RAAF on 26 June 1946, {{and returned to his}} job at Vacuum Oil. Miller resented {{the fact that many of}} his colleagues had avoided the hazards of war and moved steadily up the ladder and regarded his job as demeaning. Under such circumstances, Miller contemplated quitting Australian cricket <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> a professional contract with Rawtenstall in the Lancashire League, valued at £1,000 per year, for three seasons. With advertising and commercial commitments likely to triple this figure, playing in England would have been approximately ten times more lucrative than continuing in Australia. However, Miller was worried that his impulsive style would be curtailed by the pressures of professionalism. At that time, the Board of Control's policy stipulated that any player that signed with a professional league in England could not represent Australia. Miller's contract would see him in England until he was 30, effectively ending his career for Australia. Furthermore, it would have prevented him from playing Australian football during the winter. Miller weighed it up and opted to sign the contract that tied him to Rawtenstall, with his duties to start with the onset of the English season in April 1947.|$|E
5|$|Shaw {{appeared}} in regional theatres in Bristol, Liverpool and Hull. In 1925, he performed in London as the Archangel in The Sign of the Sun, and played first Lewis Dodd {{and then the}} Major in separate productions of The Constant Nymph. He received instruction in verse speaking under famed theatre director William Bridges-Adams in the Stratford Festival Company at Stratford-upon-Avon, where he played some of his early Shakespeare roles, including Romeo in Romeo and Juliet, Ferdinand in The Tempest and Prince Hal in Henry IV in 1926. He was criticised for the audacity he displayed in the latter role. When Prince Hal takes on his kingship and rejects the self-indulgent character Falstaff, convention of the day called for Prince Hal to change from a jovial drinking partner to an arrogant snob, but Shaw saw the view as simple-minded and contradictory toward Shakespeare's script. Instead, he displayed inward regrets about leaving Falstaff <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> the new responsibilities. The interpretation was criticised at the time but, years later, became the standard approach to the character.|$|E
5|$|The post-1785 period {{would see}} {{an era of}} {{prosperity}} of the college under Principal William Cleaver. The college began to be populated by gentlemen, its income doubling between 1790 and 1810, and academic success considerable. Efforts to reconstruct Brasenose were not completed, however, until {{the second half of}} the century with the addition of New Quad between 1886 and 1911. Brasenose's financial position remained secure, although under the tenure of Principal Edward Hartopp Cradock Brasenose's academic record waned greatly, with much of its success focussed on sports– where it excelled most notably in cricket and rowing. The mid-Century Royal Commissions were navigated– although they were opposed in form, their recommendations welcomed including the submission of accounts. The election of Charles Buller Heberden as Principal in 1889 led to a reversal in Brasenose's academic failures, although its sporting performance suffered. Heberden was the first lay Principal, presiding over an increasingly secular college, opening up the library to undergraduates, instituting an entrance exam for the first time <b>and</b> <b>accepting</b> Rhodes scholarships.|$|E
