25|$|Celle Air Base is a {{controlled}} military airbase where visual and instrument flights are allowed. It {{is surrounded by}} a control zone of <b>airspace</b> <b>class</b> “D” which is active during the hours of operation. The area of responsibility is classified as “E”.|$|E
25|$|Tivat Airport is {{assigned}} 4D classification by ICAO, <b>airspace</b> <b>class</b> D, and is {{noted for its}} challenging approach and landing procedures. Landing at Tivat is considered demanding due to hilly terrain surrounding the valley in which the airport is situated, and strong prevailing crosswinds. Runway 32 approach requires a descent into the valley of Tivatsko polje, and a 20° turn for runway alignment just before landing. Runway 14 approach is even more challenging, because of the circle to land maneuver executed in the dramatic scenery surrounding the Bay of Kotor. It is known among pilots as the European Kai Tak because of its tricky approach and landing procedures. Passengers are awarded spectacular views of the bay, the surrounding mountains and a low flyby over Porto Montenegro luxury yacht marina. The airport is also popular among plane spotters, as end of the runway is easily accessible and offers unobstructed views of takeoffs and landings, with a scenic mountain backdrop.|$|E

50|$|The airport {{does not}} have a control tower, as it has an <b>airspace</b> <b>class</b> of E. There is both an Automated Surface Observation System (ASOS) and Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF) {{available}} at Plymouth Airport.|$|E
50|$|There {{are seven}} <b>airspace</b> <b>classes</b> {{in use in}} Canada (letters A through G), but the letters do not always {{correspond}} with ICAO definitions.|$|R
5000|$|No {{flight in}} any of the <b>airspace</b> <b>classes</b> that require radio {{communication}} (B, C, or D) without first obtaining additional instruction and instructor endorsement ...|$|R
5000|$|The Albert ROPER (1919-10-13 The Paris Convention) {{implementation}} of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) <b>airspace</b> <b>classes</b> defines classes A through G (with {{the exception of}} class F which is not used in the United States). The other U.S. implementations are described below. The United States also defines categories of airspace that may overlap with <b>classes</b> of <b>airspace.</b> <b>Classes</b> of <b>airspace</b> are mutually exclusive. Thus, airspace can be [...] "class E" [...] and [...] "restricted" [...] at the same time, but it cannot be both [...] "class E" [...] and [...] "class B" [...] at the same location {{and at the same}} time.|$|R
50|$|Some {{airspace}} categories have {{no correlation}} with ICAO airspace classes but are nevertheless important in United States airspace. The <b>airspace</b> <b>class</b> (A, B, etc.) in which special use airspace is found still controls the requirements {{and procedures for}} flying into/through it.|$|E
50|$|Celle Air Base is a {{controlled}} military airbase where visual and instrument flights are allowed. It {{is surrounded by}} a control zone of <b>airspace</b> <b>class</b> “D” which is active during the hours of operation. The area of responsibility is classified as “E”.|$|E
50|$|On May 27, 2010, the FAA {{published}} {{its final}} rule mandating that by 2020 all aircraft owners {{will be required}} to have ADS-B Out capabilities when operating in any airspace that currently requires a transponder (airspace classes A, B, and C, and <b>airspace</b> <b>class</b> E at certain altitudes).|$|E
50|$|ICAO classifies <b>airspace</b> {{in seven}} <b>classes</b> from classes A to G. Controlled <b>airspace</b> is <b>classes</b> A to E, {{in order of}} {{decreasing}} ATC regulation of flights. Flight under instrument flight rules (IFR) is allowed in all controlled airspace (some countries also permit IFR in uncontrolled airspace); flight under visual flight rules (VFR) is permitted in all <b>airspace</b> except <b>class</b> A.|$|R
50|$|Uncontrolled {{airspace}} is airspace {{where an}} Air Traffic Control (ATC) service is not deemed necessary or cannot {{be provided for}} practical reasons. According to the <b>airspace</b> <b>classes</b> set by ICAO, both class F and <b>class</b> G <b>airspace</b> are uncontrolled. It {{is the opposite of}} controlled airspace.|$|R
50|$|<b>Airspace</b> <b>classes</b> A through E are {{controlled}}. Class F can {{be controlled}} or uncontrolled. Class G is always uncontrolled.Airspace is managed by Transport Canada and detailed information regarding exact dimensions and classification {{is available in the}} Designated Airspace Handbook which is published every fifty-six days by NAV CANADA.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{increased}} flight activity and its {{location in the}} busy airspace corridor between Salem McNary Field and Portland International Airport, an Air Traffic Control (ATC) tower was constructed at the Aurora State Airport. As of late 2015 construction of the control tower was complete and the tower became operational. In addition to the new ATC Tower the <b>Airspace</b> <b>class</b> designation at UAO was changed to [...] "Class D" [...] Airspace.|$|E
50|$|Uncontrolled {{airspace}} or Class G airspace is {{the portion}} of the airspace that has not been designated as Class A, B, C, D, or E. It is therefore designated uncontrolled <b>airspace.</b> <b>Class</b> G airspace extends from the surface {{to the base of the}} overlying Class E airspace. Although ATC has no authority or responsibility to control air traffic, pilots should remember there are visual flight rules (VFR) minimums which apply to Class G airspace.|$|E
50|$|In the USA {{the term}} control zone {{is no longer}} used and has been {{replaced}} by <b>airspace</b> <b>class</b> D. Typically it extends 5 miles in diameter with a height of 2500 ft AGL (above ground level) around small commercial airports. Aircraft are required to establish radio contactwith the control tower before entering and to maintain in contact while in class D airspace. This implies that an aircraft must be equipped with at least a portable radio to fly in Class D airspace.|$|E
50|$|A {{sectional}} chart shows topographical {{features that are}} important to aviators, such as terrain elevations, ground features identifiable from altitude (rivers, dams, bridges, buildings, etc.), and ground features useful to pilots (airports, beacons, landmarks, etc.). The chart also shows information on <b>airspace</b> <b>classes,</b> ground-based navigation aids, radio frequencies, longitude and latitude, navigation waypoints, navigation routes.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Class</b> A <b>airspace</b> {{extends from}} 18000 ft {{mean sea level}} MSL to FL600 (approximately 60000 ft MSL) {{throughout}} the continental United States and Alaska. Unlike the altitude measurements used in other <b>airspace</b> <b>classes,</b> the FLnnn flight levels used in <b>class</b> A <b>airspace</b> are pressure altitudes referenced to a standardized altimeter setting of 29.92" [...] Hg and thus the true altitudes depend on local atmospheric pressure variations.|$|R
5000|$|In the UK, an IR (UK restricted) - {{formerly}} the [...] "IMC rating" [...] - which permits flight under IFR in <b>airspace</b> <b>classes</b> B to G in instrument meteorological conditions, a non-instrument-rated pilot can also elect to fly under IFR in {{visual meteorological conditions}} outside controlled airspace. Compared {{to the rest of}} the world, the UK's flight crew licensing regime is somewhat unusual in its licensing for meteorological conditions and airspace, rather than flight rules.|$|R
5000|$|In Iraq, The Flight Information Regions (FIR) {{is known}} as Baghdad FIR. It is {{classified}} into Class A, D, E and G <b>airspace.</b> <b>Class</b> B, C and F airspace are not used in the Baghdad FIR. Air traffic services are provided in all controlled airspace, by the controlling ATC Unit, based on an ATS Surveillance System (supplemented by procedural non-ATS Surveillance System procedures) or MRU where authorized based on Procedural (non- ATC Surveillance System) procedures and supplemented by ATC Surveillance System where possible.|$|E
50|$|Class B {{airspace}} {{extends from}} the surface up to 10,000 ft. AGL and is the area above and around the busiest airports (e.g., LAX, MIA, CVG) and is also heavily controlled. A side view of Class B airspace resembles an upside-down wedding cake with three layers becoming bigger toward the top. Class B's layers are designed individually {{to meet the needs}} of the airport they overlay. Pilots must also receive clearance to enter the Class B airspace but Visual Flight Rules may be used, unlike in Class A <b>airspace.</b> <b>Class</b> B airspace corresponds to the area formerly known as a Terminal Control Area or TCA.|$|E
50|$|Other {{controlled}} airspace is designated as Class E, this includes {{a large part}} of the lower <b>airspace.</b> <b>Class</b> E airspace exists in many forms. It can serve as a surface-based extension to Class D airspace to accommodate IFR approach/departure procedure areas. Class E airspace can be designated to have a floor of 700' AGL or 1,200' AGL, or a customized floor of any other altitude. Class E airspace exists above Class G surface areas from 14,500' MSL to 18,000 MSL. Federal airways from 1,200 AGL to 18,000 MSL within 4 mi of the centerline of the airway is designated Class E airspace. Airspace at any altitude over 60,000' (the ceiling of Class A airspace) is designated Class E airspace.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{identify}} operational difficulties, which hamper the integration of RPAS into the airspace, and point out potential solutions. A fictitious scenario of a RPA carrying urgently needed spare parts from the hub Frankfurt/Main to the small regional airport Rostock-Laage is used to highlight the prerequisites for the integration provided by the different <b>airspace</b> <b>classes</b> in Germany. The design and performance characteristics of the RPA {{are based on a}} manned turboprop aircraft, hence it must comply with the procedures currently used in manned aviation...|$|R
50|$|The Shannon FIR {{contains}} the SOTA (Shannon Oceanic Transition Area) and NOTA (North Oceanic Transition Area), {{as of the}} start of 2006. The <b>airspace</b> is <b>class</b> A <b>airspace</b> from FL55 to FL660.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>Class</b> A <b>airspace,</b> {{since all}} <b>Class</b> A {{operations}} must be conducted IFR.|$|R
50|$|Restricted {{airspace}} zones may not {{be active}} ("hot") at all times; in such cases there are typically schedules of local dates and times available to aviators specifying when the zone is active, and at other times, the airspace is subject to normal VFR/IFR operation for the applicable <b>airspace</b> <b>class.</b> A few zones are activated by NOTAM; an example is R-2503D over Camp Pendleton in southern California, between San Diego and Los Angeles. This particular zone, beginning at 2000ft above sea level over most of southern Camp Pendleton, can only be active for {{a certain number of}} days per year, thus allowing small planes to fly a direct route over land between the two metro areas instead of being diverted offshore or into mountainous terrain further inland.|$|E
5000|$|The 1993 Auckland mid-air {{collision}} was an aircraft accident in New Zealand. It occurred on 26 November 1993, when two aircraft operated by Airwork, {{under contract to}} the New Zealand Police, collided and crashed in central Auckland. The {{mid-air collision}} of the Aérospatiale TwinStar helicopter and Piper Archer aeroplane resulted {{in the deaths of}} all four occupants [...] - [...] a civilian Airwork pilot on each aircraft and two New Zealand Police officers on the helicopter. The accident occurred in daylight with excellent visibility, in uncontrolled <b>airspace</b> (<b>class</b> G), with both aircraft flying under visual flight rules. Both the helicopter and aeroplane were operated by Airwork (NZ), and working under contract to the New Zealand Police {{at the time of the}} accident.|$|E
50|$|If the {{airspace}} is not Class A, B, C, or D, and {{is controlled}} airspace, {{then it is}} Class E <b>airspace.</b> <b>Class</b> E airspace extends upward from either the surface or a designated altitude to the overlying or adjacent controlled airspace. When designated as a surface area, the airspace is configured to contain all instrument procedures. Also in this class are federal airways, airspace beginning at either 700 or 1,200 feet above ground level (AGL) used to transition {{to and from the}} terminal or en route environment, and en route domestic and offshore airspace areas designated below 18,000 feet MSL. Unless designated at a lower altitude, Class E airspace begins at 14,500 MSL over the United States, including that airspace overlying the waters within 12 NM of the coast of the 48 contiguous states and Alaska, up to but not including 18,000 feet MSL, and the airspace above FL 600.|$|E
