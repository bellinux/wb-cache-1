500|$|Brandon Sanderson's {{review in}} The Official Time Waster's Guide cites the comic's world design, {{longevity}} and a discomforting setting where intelligent animals are killed as strengths. However, Sanderson also complained that Holbrook does not enforce this aspect {{in the main}} characters, saying, [...] "While Kell, Rudy, and others make kills every day, none of the main character herbivores ever really {{have to worry about}} being stalked and killed. When they are threatened (such as when Lindesfarne is stalked by some cougars near the beginning of the comic's run), the enemy predators are presented as dark, evil things to be defeated.…This sense of careless, off-handed killing gives the comic <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> humor—however, to maintain that air of humor, Bill never allows the society to work its everyday worst on any of the main characters." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviews of Bookends {{upon its}} release in 1968 were largely positive. Allen Evans of the British {{publication}} New Musical Express (NME) gave the record {{four out of}} five stars and called it [...] "inspiring, descriptive music," [...] while noting the album is [...] "Imaginative and at times confusing to know what the composer is getting at, if anything." [...] Rival newspaper Melody Maker did not use a ratings system, but called Bookends a [...] "thoughtful, clever and well-produced album." [...] Reviewer Chris Welch criticized the songs as [...] "not particularly tuneful," [...] but performed with [...] "Beatles fervour and Beatles conviction," [...] praising the lyricism, opining that [...] "The words capture part of America today, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> sickness and tragedy." [...] In the US, Rolling Stone reviewer Arthur Schmidt wrote that [...] "The music is, for me, questionable, but I've always found their music questionable.

500|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} with previous Ace Attorney games, players could identify with Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice; for Ace Attorney Investigations, they wanted players to be {{immersed in the}} game and feel like they are Edgeworth. He said that they think players will feel a connection with Edgeworth and understand his character. As examples of this, Eshiro cited the ability to directly control Edgeworth, and the possibility to see inside his head: the game's logic system was created because the development team wanted to show how Edgeworth thinks. It represents what is happening inside his mind, which Eshiro describes as a [...] "very cool, calm and collected way of thinking". For the rebuttal phases in the game, Eshiro wanted to try out new things that could not be done in courtroom battles: during rebuttals, several characters come in and out during each scene at a rapid pace, providing the player with evidence, to create drama with tension. Ace Attorney Investigations has a larger focus on the environment than previous Ace Attorney titles had; previous titles featured gameplay elements in which the player finds contradictions in suspects' statements, whereas the goal of Ace Attorney Investigations is to find things at the crime scene that contradict the evidence the player has. The game's third person perspective was specifically chosen to be different from the main series' first person perspective, and to show the environment so that players can walk around inside it. The game system was designed specifically for Ace Attorney Investigations, with the aim of being different from the main series; therefore, Eshiro felt that <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> features should stay within the Investigations series, and not be used in other Ace Attorney titles.|$|E
500|$|When first announced, XV {{used the}} mythos of Fabula Nova Crystallis, {{described}} by Kitase as [...] "a backdrop and starting point" [...] for the story. For Versus XIII, Nomura {{decided to focus}} more on the world and on realistic human characters. The terminology of the mythos, including the concept of l'Cie (magically imbued warriors burdened with a pre-determined task), was originally present in Versus XIII. A key figure in the mythos, the Goddess Etro, was originally represented in-game in a piece of artwork by Amano and was a key deity worshiped in the game world. During the transition process between Versus XIII and XV, the game [...] "disconnected" [...] from the mythos' core framework, existing as a thematic base for the world and story without being overtly expressed. While the adjustments were being decided upon, it was chosen to keep the mythos as part of XV, as much of the world was built upon it and would lose <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> substance if removed entirely. Instead, the team chose to adjust the mythos to fit the game's modern setting. Specific terminology, such as [...] "l'Cie" [...] and [...] "fal'Cie", was removed so the game would retain an individual identity and introduce the concepts in an understandable way. A common theme that carried over into XV was defined by Tabata as humans chosen by the crystal placing their lives at risk. The revised cosmology drew inspiration from Japanese folklore and various Western mythologies. The game's summoned monsters, referred to in-game as [...] "Astrals", were designed to play integral parts in the story and world as opposed to being simple monsters to be called into battle. They were intelligent beings that Noctis needed to forge a pact with rather than simply commanding them. Due to their key role in the story, the staff chose traditional Final Fantasy summons such as Leviathan and Titan instead of creating ones unique to the game.|$|E

'Illegal' {{in the words of the}} state." [...] He criticised neoliberal reforms like free trade, [...] "which destroy Mexican agriculture" [...] through dumping American and Canadian corn in Mexico; as well as the denial of land reform citing examples such as Honduras and Guatemala. He elaborated [...] "Gradually you make it impossible in the Southern countries for a peasantry to survive and make a go of it," [...] and concluded that this process has left people in Mexico, Central and South America little choice except to find work in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Rytas {{was told}} that no schools would be {{approved}} if they were less than [...] from a public Polish school and instead concentrated on reestablishing local chapters and reading rooms. From June to August, Rytas established 103 chapters with about 1,500 members. Further activities were interrupted by World War II. After the invasion of Poland in September 1939, Vilnius Region was occupied by the Soviet Union and then partially transferred to Lithuania in October according to the Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty.

[...] "Basically, I'm not Lizzie McGuire anymore", she said. She said the album deals with issues she would not discuss publicly and provides [...] "some answers", but she disagreed with people who believed the album presented a different side of her, saying [...] "I think it's just more me this time because I got to really do it how I wanted to."

2500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, [...] " [...] is a {{much more}} complex film than Mr. Carpenter's 'Halloween,' though it's not really about {{anything}} more complicated than a scare down the spine. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> eerie power comes from the kind of unexplained, almost supernatural events one expects to find in a horror movie but not in a melodrama of this sort … If the movie is really about anything at all, it's about methods of urban warfare and defense. Mr. Carpenter is an extremely resourceful director whose ability to construct films entirely out of action and movement suggests that he may one day be a director to rank with Don Siegel." [...] Jeffrey Wells of Films In Review wrote, [...] "Skillfully paced and edited, Assault was rich with Hawksian dialogue and humor, especially in the clever caricature of the classic 'Hawks woman' by Laurie Zimmer." [...] Tom Allen and Andrew Sarris of the Village Voice described the film as [...] "one of the most stylishly kinetic independent films of the 1970s." [...] Alan Jones of Starburst wrote, [...] "Bravura remake of Rio Bravo." [...] Dave Golder of SFX magazine hailed the film as, [...] "A superb, bloody thriller about a siege in an abandoned L.A. cop station." [...] In his book The Horror Films of the 1970s, John Kenneth Muir gave the film three and a half stars, calling it [...] "a lean, mean exciting horror motion picture... a movie of ingenuity, cunning and thrills." [...] Mick Martin & Marsha Porter of the Video Movie Guide gave the film four and a half stars out of five, writing, [...] "…John Carpenter's riveting movie about a nearly deserted L.A. police station that finds itself under siege by a youth gang. It's a modern day version of Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo, with exceptional performances by the entire cast." [...] In 2003, Dalton Ross of Entertainment Weekly described Assault as [...] "a tight, tense thriller … Carpenter's eerie score and Douglas Knapp's stylish cinematography give this low-budget shoot-out all the weight of an urban Rio Bravo." [...] Leonard Maltin also gave the film three and a half stars out of four: [...] "A nearly deserted L.A. police station finds itself under a state of siege by a youth gang in this riveting thriller, a modern-day paraphrase of Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo. Writer/director Carpenter also did the eerie music score for this knockout." ...|$|E

60|$|In my experience, {{games played}} with a fiendish outfit furnish ecstasies of delight which games played with the other kind cannot match. Twenty-seven years ago my budding little family spent the summer at Bateman's Point, near Newport, Rhode Island. It was a {{comfortable}} boarding-place, well stocked with sweet mothers and little children, but the male sex was scarce; however, there was another young fellow besides myself, and he and I had good times--Higgins was his name, {{but that was not}} his fault. He was a very pleasant and companionable person. On the premises there was what had once been a bowling-alley. It was a single alley, and it was estimated that it had been out of repair for sixty years--but not the balls, the balls were in good condition; there were forty-one of them, and they ranged in size from a grapefruit up to a lignum-vitæ sphere that you could hardly lift. Higgins and I played on that alley day after day. At first, one of us located himself at the bottom end to set up the pins in case anything should happen to them, but nothing happened. The surface of that alley consisted of a rolling stretch of elevations and depressions, and neither of us could, by any art known to us, persuade a ball to stay on the alley until it should accomplish something. Little balls and big, the same thing always happened--the ball left the alley before it was half-way home and went thundering down alongside of it {{the rest of the way}} and made the gamekeeper climb out and take care of himself. No matter, we persevered, and were rewarded. We examined the alley, noted and located <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> peculiarities, and little by little we learned how to deliver a ball in such a way that it would travel home and knock down a pin or two. By and by we succeeded in improving our game to a point where we were able to get all of the pins with thirty-five balls--so we made it a thirty-five-ball game. If the player did not succeed with thirty-five, he had lost the game. I suppose that all the balls, taken together, weighed five hundred pounds, or maybe a ton--or along there somewhere--but anyway it was hot weather, and by the time that a player had sent thirty-five of them home he was in a drench of perspiration, and physically exhausted.|$|E
