50|$|On the {{southern}} {{islands of the}} Arctic Archipelago patches of low-lying and dwarf versions of arctic deciduous and evergreen shrubs are identified. In certain regions - such as Nunavut, the Baffin Uplands and the Lancaster Plateaus - Arctic willow (Salix arctica), purple saxifrage (Saxifraga oppositifolia) and Kobresia simpliciuscula are also common. Other species found include the northern <b>Labrador</b> <b>tea,</b> Vaccinium ssp., foxtail grass and Luzula multiflora. In the Southern Arctic tundra, shrubs are more regular, consisting of dwarf birch, <b>Arctic</b> willow, northern <b>Labrador</b> <b>tea,</b> Dryas spp., and Vaccinium ssp. In waterlogged areas, moss, willow and sedge cover is substantial.|$|R

50|$|Toxicity occurs due to terpenoid ledol {{found in}} all <b>Labrador</b> <b>tea</b> species. R. groenlandicum has the lowest {{toxicity}} due to lower levels of ledol. Grayanotoxins are also present, but few lethal human cases of poisoning due to grayanotoxins in <b>Labrador</b> <b>tea</b> have been documented. However, lethal poisonings have been documented in livestock.|$|R
