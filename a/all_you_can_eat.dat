25|$|Formerly {{a working-class}} neighborhood, Wrigleyville is the {{nickname}} {{to the neighborhood}} directly surrounding Wrigley Field. Also known as Lakeview West, its borders run from Cornelia Avenue and Grace Street, to Halsted Street and Racine Avenue. Wrigleyville features low-rise brick buildings and houses, some with rooftop bleachers colloquially called Wrigley Rooftops where people can purchase seats to watch baseball games or concerts that, while generally more expensive than tickets for seats within the park itself, come with <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>eat</b> and drink service. Proprietors {{are able to do}} so under special agreements with the Chicago Cubs organization. Many Wrigleyville bars and restaurants (particularly on North Clark Street) feature sports-oriented themes. Bars such as Sluggers, Murphy's Bleachers, Casey Moran's, Rockwood Place, Sports Corner and The Cubby Bear host the Cubs crowds near the Wrigley Field intersection of North Clark Street and West Addison Street.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have taken}} issue with ticket {{prices at the}} ballpark, set at $7, $15, and $18. While less {{expensive}} than ticket prices for major league ballparks, prices are {{among the highest in}} all minor league classes. However, the ballpark has seen strong attendance despite these ticket prices. The ballpark runs a number of specials throughout the year including [...] "Friends & Family" [...] where 4 tickets, 4 hats and 4 value meals to a restaurant cost less than $10 a ticket. It also has a [...] "High 5 Plan" [...] where a block of 5 games (roughly one game each month) start at $9 a game, or a $19 ticket that includes <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>eat</b> food and drink. In its inaugural season, Dr Pepper Ballpark had an attendance of 675,620, ranking it fourth overall in minor league baseball attendance for the year. The ballpark sold out for 53 RoughRiders home games that season.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} comply with a conditional-use permit {{limiting}} Dodger Stadium's seating capacity to 56,000 it was the only current MLB park (through 2005 [...] ) that had never increased its capacity. Whenever higher revenue lower seats were added some in the upper deck or pavilion were removed to keep the number the same. Through the sale of standing room only tickets, the Dodgers' 2009 home opener drew 57,099 fans, the largest crowd in stadium history. Following a number of incidents in the early 1970s in which fans showered Cincinnati Reds left fielder Pete Rose with beer, bottles, cups, and trash, the sale of beer was discontinued in both pavilions. Beer sales were reinstated in the right field pavilion in 2008, when that section was converted into the <b>All</b> <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Eat</b> Pavilion. Fans seated in that section can eat unlimited hot dogs and peanuts and also have access to free soft drinks. There is a charge for beer.|$|E

2500|$|Blue Horse {{invariably}} dined with Burbank at {{noon and}} {{always had a}} good appetite. One day, after dinner, Burbank said to Blue Horse: [...] "I notice that you always eat everything in front of you, but you never pass your plate back the second time or ask for another cup of coffee. Why is that? Is it because you cannot eat any more or drink any more coffee. O, yes, he replied, I could eat more, but I thought the twenty-five cents you paid for my dinner was for just what was placed before me. No, I said, the twenty-five cents pays for <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>eat.</b> Hereafter, if one plate is not enough, ask for more, and drink all the coffee you want. All right, he replied, I will. And he did. I also told him to tell his friends this, and suggested that if any white men sitting at his table left anything to eat on their plates before them, {{that it would be}} all right for him to gather it up and take it home for his wife and children. It is needless to say that all the Sioux Indians who patronized that hotel afterward got all that was coming to them.” One time Blue Horse was in the Indian trader's store with his little niece, who saw something on the shelves that she very much wanted. Blue Horse had no money, so he took off his old moccasins and gave them to the Indian trader in exchange for what the little girl craved and he walked home barefooted.|$|E
