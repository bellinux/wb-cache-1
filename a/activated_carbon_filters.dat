25|$|Granular Activated Carbon adsorption: {{a form of}} {{activated}} carbon with a high surface area, adsorbs many compounds including many toxic compounds. Water passing through {{activated carbon}} is commonly used in municipal regions with organic contamination, taste or odors. Many household water filters and fish tanks use <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>filters</b> to further purify the water. Household filters for drinking water sometimes contain silver as metallic silver nanoparticle. If water is held in the carbon block for longer periods, microorganisms can grow inside which results in fouling and contamination. Silver nanoparticles are excellent anti-bacterial material and they can decompose toxic halo-organic compounds such as pesticides into non-toxic organic products.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} type of aquarium filter consists only of filter {{wool and}} activated carbon. The filter wool traps large debris and particles, and the activated carbon adsorbs smaller impurities. These {{should be changed}} regularly at suitable intervals. [...] This is particularly important {{in the case of}} <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>filters,</b> which may re-release their adsorbed contents in large (and therefore harmful) doses if they are allowed to saturate. Activated carbon adsorbs toxins on the extended porous surface of the carbon. It cannot be reactivated by boiling in water. The adsorption of activated carbon can be restored by thermal regeneration at temperatures of 500–900°C (932–1,652°F), electrochemical regeneration, ultrasound, or other industrial processes. For the aquarist, replacing the activated carbon with fresh material is simple and inexpensive.|$|E
2500|$|Micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, {{ingredients}} of household chemicals, chemicals used in small businesses or industries, environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant (EPPP) or pesticides {{may not be}} eliminated in the conventional treatment process (primary, secondary and tertiary treatment) and therefore lead to water pollution. Although concentrations of those substances and their decompostion products are quite low, {{there is still a}} chance to harm aquatic organisms. For pharmaceuticals, the following substances have been identified as [...] "toxicologically relevant": substances with endocrine disrupting effects, genotoxic substances and substances that enhance the development of bacterial resistances. They mainly belong to the group of environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants. Techniques for elimination of micropollutants via a fourth treatment stage during sewage treatment are being tested in Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands. However, since those techniques are still costly, they are not yet applied on a regular basis. Such process steps mainly consist of <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>filters</b> that adsorb the micropollutants. Ozone can also be applied as an oxidative method. Also the use of enzymes such as the enzyme laccase is under investigation. A new concept which could provide an energy-efficient treatment of micropollutants could be the use of laccase secreting fungi cultivated at a wastewater treatment plant to degrade micropollutants {{and at the same time}} to provide enzymes at a cathode of a microbial biofuel cells. Microbial biofuel cells are investigated for their property to treat organic matter in wastewater.|$|E
