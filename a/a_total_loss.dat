5|$|A 2007–2008 {{survey of}} over 19% of all colonies {{revealed}} <b>a</b> <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> of 35.8%. Operations that pollinated almonds lost, on average, {{the same number}} of colonies as those that did not. The 37.9% of operations that reported having at least some of their colonies die with a complete lack of bees had <b>a</b> <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> of 40.8% of colonies compared to the 17.1% loss reported by beekeepers without this symptom. Large operations {{were more likely to have}} this symptom, suggesting a contagious condition may be a causal factor. About 60% of all colonies that were reported dead in this survey died without the presence of dead bees in the hive, thus possibly suffered from CCD.|$|E

5|$|Abdül Kadir was {{the first}} Ottoman pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} to be constructed. She was laid down in 1892 {{at the beginning of}} a small-scale expansion of the Ottoman Navy. Work slowed down considerably once she was framed. By the early 1900s the only progress that had been made was the addition of armor plating around her keel. Once that was finished, work ceased. Construction was planned to resume in 1904 but by that time her keel blocks, which were used to prevent hogging and sagging, had shifted and the ship was considered <b>a</b> <b>total</b> <b>loss.</b> She was scrapped on the slipway in 1914.

5|$|Cahill had won {{popular support}} as a {{vigorous}} and impressive minister who had resolved problems with New South Wales' electricity supply {{and in his}} first 10 months as premier had reinvigorated the party. He brought order to the government's chaotic public works program. In addition, he attacked the increasingly unpopular federal Coalition government of Robert Menzies. All this, combined with Bruxner and Treatt constantly clashing over policy and candidate issues, contributed to the Liberal-Country Coalition again being defeated at the 14 February 1953 election. This amounted to <b>a</b> <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> of ten seats, three being Country Party seats, and a swing against them of 7.2%. Bruxner retained his seat with 60.15%.|$|E

5|$|For {{eight years}} after the fire, One Meridian Plaza sat vacant and damaged—in the center of Philadelphia's {{business}} district.

At the time of its demolition in 1999, One Meridian Plaza was the third-tallest destroyed building in the world.|$|E

5|$|Like the {{preceding}} Siegfried-class ships, Odin and Ägir were obsolete {{by the time}} World War I had started. Regardless, they were still used in their primary role until 1915, at which point they were withdrawn from active service. The ships performed a variety of secondary duties {{until the end of}} the war. On 17 June 1919, both ships were struck from the naval register and sold to the A. Bernstein Company in Hamburg. The shipping company had the ships rebuilt as freighters; Odin served in this capacity until she was scrapped in 1935, however Ägir accidentally grounded near the Karlsö lighthouse on the island of Gotland in 1929 and proved to be <b>a</b> <b>total</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E
5|$|North of Guam, Chataan {{affected}} Rota with 74km/h (46mph) sustained {{winds and}} gusts to 120km/h (75mph) at the island's airport. Rainfall {{was much less}} than elsewhere in the typhoon's path, and a 24-hour total of 38.6mm (1.52in) was reported at Rota's airport. The storm inflicted heavy damage to crops and fisheries, and 60% of farmers reported <b>a</b> <b>total</b> <b>loss.</b> Chataan also damaged roads on the island, many due to fallen trees.
