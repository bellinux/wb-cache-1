2500|$|The {{new series}} is a {{continuation}} of the old series, with the story continuing after a 20-year break. It does not take the events of the 1990s TV movies [...] or [...] as canon. Instead we find the characters 20 years after the events of the Season 14 cliffhanger. In an interview with UltimateDallas.com, writer/producer Cynthia Cidre was asked to describe the new Dallas. She responded, [...] "I tried to be really, really respectful of the original Dallas because it was really clear to me that the people who love Dallas are [...] Trekkies, really committed to that show <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> not understand that before, so I never wanted to violate anything that had happened in the past. On the other hand that was the past, twenty years had gone by, so at the same time I think we're properly balanced between the characters of Bobby Ewing, J.R. and Sue Ellen. I also have the new cast and it's John Ross and Christopher, the children of Bobby and J.R., and their love interests. Total respect and a balance of old and new." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} July, Tunney competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England {{where she}} was Team GB's {{youngest}} athlete at the games, aged 15. She helped the British team qualify in fifth place and individually she qualified to the all around final with a score of 56.391. [...] Tunney said, [...] "I went out thinking I should just enjoy my first Olympics <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did.</b> It was {{the most amazing thing}} I've ever done in my life. It was tense but the crowd were so supportive." [...] In the team final, Tunney contributed scores of 14.866 on vault and 14.766 on uneven bars toward the British team's sixth-place finish. [...] She said, [...] "First Olympic Games and we're getting into the team final and finishing sixth, you can't ask for anything bigger. It was inspiring to see the men get a medal. They did their best yesterday and so did we, even though we didn't medal." [...] In the all around final, Tunney placed thirteenth with a score of 56.932. [...] She said, [...] "It's been an amazing experience here in London; the best week of my life. To compete at a home Games in front of this crowd has been incredible. To be the youngest in Team GB I'm very proud and I've learnt so much. The rest of the Games I'm looking forward to the atmosphere and cheering on Team GB." ...|$|E

60|$|MRS. JUNO [thoughtfully] I don't {{know what}} to say. I must think over it. I have always been rather severe on this sort of thing; {{but when it came}} to the point I didn't behave as I thought I should behave. I didn't intend to be wicked; but somehow or other, Nature, or {{whatever}} you choose to call it, didn't take much notice of my intentions.

I am not at all a superstitious man, or one given to vain imaginings, but I am sure that Savage <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> see and hear the spirit or the shadow of my wife. Her body {{it could not have}} been as you will admit, though how she could utter, or seem to utter, audible speech without one is more than I can tell. Also I am sure that she is captive upon yonder mountain and came to call me to rescue her. Under these circumstances I feel that it is my duty, as well as my desire, to give up any idea of leaving the country and try to find out the truth." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} for it, but to turn back and begin all over again. It was very hard, but I turned back, though with a heavy heart, and began laboriously and methodically to plod over the same tedious ground at a snail's pace; {{stopping}} to examine minutely every speck in the way, on all sides, and making the most desperate efforts to know these elusive characters by sight wherever I met them. I was always punctual at the office; at the Doctor's too: <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> work, as the common expression is, like a cart-horse. One day, when I went to the Commons as usual, I found Mr. Spenlow in the doorway looking extremely grave, and talking to himself. As {{he was in the}} habit of complaining of pains in his head--he had naturally a short throat, and I do seriously believe he over-starched himself--I was at first alarmed by the idea that he was not quite right in that direction; but he soon relieved my uneasiness.|$|E

"Mrs. Whimple," [...] said Herbert, when I {{told him}} so, [...] "is {{the best of}} housewives, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not know what my Clara would do without her motherly help.

5000|$|A {{director}} called Michael Gracey did the video. When {{he presented}} {{the idea to}} me, I was won over straight away. I always had a thing for Jane Fonda in Barbarella!

5000|$|Joe Klein refuted {{the charges}} of anti-Semitism in his reply, stating that he was [...] "anti-neoconservative".Listen, people can vote {{whichever}} way they want, for whatever reason they want. I just don't want to see policy makers who make decisions {{on the basis of}} whether American policy will benefit Israel or not. In some cases, you want to provide protection for Israel certainly, but you don't want {{to go to war with}} Iran. When Jennifer Rubin or Abe Foxman calls me antisemitic, they're wrong. I am anti-neoconservative. I think these people are following very perversely extremist policies <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> believe that it was time for mainstream Jews to stand up and say, [...] "They don't represent us, they don't represent Israel." ...|$|E

'Well, I have been thinking of that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not believe there was anything in it.

50|$|In the 1940s, with {{hopes of}} {{spending}} more time on her art, Schinasi moved west to Los Angeles first expanding and finally selling her eyeglass concern. The move away from her business and New York allowed for {{a new level of}} commitment to her art. Having begun studies with Howard Warshaw at Jepson School of Art in Los Angeles. Schinasi said, “I took a room in the house as my studio and put a sign on the door: ‘Do not come in unless there’s a catastrophe. I wanted to have three hours a day just to myself without interruption, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> work very hard.’” Altina began to paint in earnest and her large paintings were selected for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) juried show. In Los Angeles, Altina spent many years as a volunteer art therapist and muralist at experimental mental health center, Synanon.|$|E

5000|$|Walter Hill {{later said}} he was [...] "determined {{to keep it a}} very big and open canvas". I know there were two things that were beyond the script elements. Unless you really saw the country that they were caught up in and also felt the weight of the herd and what the herd does to {{decision}} making. The fact that these are all tiny characters caught up in a bad landscape may not sound very controversial but when you're dealing with a venue like the small screen that is contrary to what a lot of guys perceive to be good form. A lot of people say you the way to deal with it is to accommodate the reality of it and play it closer and more intimately. But I just {{thought you were going to}} lose a lot if you did that <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> feel that you were going to know the characters so I wasn't going to cheat them but I wanted to put them in a big landscape. One scene he is most proud of occurs when Church's character has to put one of the horses down by shooting it after it hurts its leg.|$|E
500|$|Three {{months before}} he died, Hergé stated that [...] "Unfortunately I cannot say much about this {{forthcoming}} Tintin adventure because, though I started it three years ago, I have not had much {{time to work on}} it and still do not know how it will turn out.

Robinson was {{dissatisfied}} with how Dorsey Burnette sang a version of it and offered it to Guitar. [...] "I said, 'I'll give up my royalties and everything just to do this song,'" [...] she told Robinson in recounting their collaboration on [...] "Dark Moon" [...] to Wayne Jancik in The Billboard Book of One-Hit Wonders. [...] "I knew it was up for grabs and somebody was gonna get it. I got it, but he took me at my word, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> give up my royalties. It was {{one of the hardest things}} I ever put together. Ned Miller wrote it, but we tried in maybe five or six different ways in different studios before it came out right." [...] The final version consisted of just two guitars and a bass backing Bonnie. [...] The song was originally issued under Fabor Records in 1956. [...] "Dark Moon" [...] was then issued over to Dot Records and by the spring of 1957, [...] "Dark Moon" [...] hit the pop top 10 list and went into the country top 15 list.
