40|$|We present {{observations}} of the 85. 69 GHz continuum emission and H 42 alpha line emission from the central 30 arcsec within NGC 4945. Both sources of emission originate from nearly identical structures that can be modelled as exponential discs with a scale length of ~ 2. 1 arcsec (or ~ 40 pc). An analysis of the spectral energy distribution based on combining these data with archival data imply that 84 % +/- 10 % of the 85. 69 GHz continuum emission originates from free-free emission. The electron temperature is 5400 +/- 600 K, which is comparable {{to what has been}} measured near the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy. The star formation rate (SFR) based on the H 42 alpha and 85. 69 GHz free-free emission (and using a distance of 3. 8 Mpc) is 4. 35 +/- 0. 25 M/yr. This is consistent with the SFR from the total infrared flux and with previous measurements based on recombination line emission, and it is within a factor of ~ 2 of SFRs derived from radio data. The Spitzer Space Telescope 24 micron data and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer 22 micron data yield SFRs ~ 10 x lower than the ALMA measurements, most likely because the mid-infrared data are strongly affected by dust <b>attenuation</b> <b>equivalent</b> to A_V= 150.

40|$|The {{essential}} requirement of a material {{to be used}} for engineering purposes at nuclear establishments is its ability to attenuate the most penetrating ionizing radiations, gamma (γ) -rays. Mostly, high-Z materials such as heavy concrete, lead, mercury, and their mixtures or alloys have been used in the construction of nuclear establishments and thus termed as nuclear engineering materials (NEM). The NEM are classified into two categories, namely opaque and transparent, depending on their behavior towards the visible spectrum of EM waves. The majority of NEM are opaque. By contrast, various types of glass, which are transparent to visible light, are necessary at certain places in the nuclear establishments. In the present study, γ-ray shielding behaviors (GSB) of six glass samples (transparent NEM) were evaluated and compared with some opaque NEM {{in a wide range of}} energy (15  keV– 15  MeV) and optical thickness (OT).

One method would be to use the differential attenuation measured between the two frequencies of the radar as an indication of the rain rate. Microwave attenuation is widely regarded as a good estimator of the intensity of precipitation. The theory of microwave attenuation is presented, as well as an estimation of the error sources involved in the measurement of attenuation with dual-wavelength radars. Two long-time datasets of disdrometer data are used to test the feasibility of tuning the radar Z - R relationship by measuring the relation between reflectivity and X-band attenuation. As an interesting fact, a surprising proportionality between these two variables is found for higher intensities of precipitation (Z > 40 dBZ).

40|$|International audienceIn the high-intensity focused {{ultrasound}} (US), or HIFU, field, it {{is well-known}} that the cavitation {{effect can be}} used to induce lesions of larger volume. The principle is based on the increase in the <b>equivalent</b> <b>attenuation</b> coefficient of the tissue {{in the presence of the}} bubbles created by cavitation. The elementary lesions produced by combination of cavitation and thermal effects, using focused transducers, were spherical and developed upstream of the focal point. This paper presents a method that combines cavitation with a thermal effect to obtain deeper lesions using a plane transducer, rather than a focused one. The cavitation effect was produced by delivering intensities of 60 W/cm 2 at the face of the transducer for 0. 5 s. The applicator was then rotated through 90 degrees at a constant speed of between 0. 5 and 1. 5 degrees /s. During this rotation, ex vivo tissues were exposed continuously to an acoustic intensity of 14 W/cm 2 to combine the cavitation effect with a thermal effect. The necroses were, on average, twice as deep when the cavitation effect was used as those obtained with a thermal effect alone. Observed macroscopically, the lesions have a very well-delimited geometry. Temperature measurements made at different angles of treatment have shown that they were coagulation necroses...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} a seven-day {{exposure}} to a 2 °C increase above the maximum summer temperature and an 86 % reduction in subsurface irradiance on the net photosynthetic output and mortality of the scleractinian coral species Montastrea cavernosa were examined in vitro as both single- and simultaneous multiple-stressor events. The effect on photosynthetic output was expressed as the percent change in the Pg:R 24 ratio following the seven-day treatment period. Mortality {{was defined as the}} absence of viable coral tissue {{at the end of the}} seven-day recovery period. The level of elevated temperature (31. 5 °C) was based on partial datasets of in situ measurements of subsurface temperature, spanning the years 2000 - 2002, recorded on the crest of the outer reef tract of Ft. Lauderdale, FL at a depth of 15 m. The degree of irradiance <b>attenuation</b> was <b>equivalent</b> to an increase in turbidity from the ambient value of 0. 3 NTU at the average specimen collection depth of 21. 3 m to a value 10 NTU, induced by an increase in total suspended solids from 7. 6 to 57. 0 mg L- 1. The individual stressors of elevated temperature and reduced irradiance both produced significant, sub-lethal depressions of the Pg:R 24 ratio of M. cavernosa colonies, but a significant interaction between the two stressors was not detected. However, simultaneous exposure to the two stressors did result in significantly greater post-recovery mortality, evidence of an exacerbative interaction between elevated temperature and reduced irradiance for the relatively deep dwelling colonies of M. cavernosa in this study. The finding of a significant exacerbative interaction between elevated temperature and reduced irradiance on coral mortality illustrates the importance of considering multiple-stressors when assessing the {{effects of a}}nthropogenic and natural disturbances on the current and future health of coral reefs. Pertinent to local issues of coastal zone management, the finding of a significant effect of attenuated radiance on the Pg:R 24 ratio and a potentially lethal interaction between attenuated irradiance and elevated temperature indicates the current Florida regulatory limit of 29 NTU above background may not adequately protect scleractinians occupying the deeper reef zones...|$|R
40|$|Gasoline direct {{injection}} (GDI) vehicles {{have recently been}} identified as a significant source of carbonaceous aerosol, of both primary and secondary origin. Here we investigated primary emissions and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from GDI vehicle exhaust for multiple vehicles and driving test cycles, and novel GDI after-treatment systems. Emissions were characterized by proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (gaseous non-methane organic compounds, NMOCs), aerosol mass spectrometry (sub-micron non-refractory particles), and light <b>attenuation</b> measurements (<b>equivalent</b> black carbon (eBC) determination using Aethalometer measurements) together with supporting instrumentation. We evaluated the effect of retrofitted prototype gasoline particle filters (GPFs) on primary eBC, organic aerosol (OA), NMOCs, as well as SOA formation. Two regulatory driving test cycles were investigated, and the importance of distinct phases within these cycles (e. g. cold engine start, hot engine start, high speed driving) to primary emissions and secondary products was evaluated. Atmospheric processing was simulated using both the PSI mobile smog chamber (SC) and the potential aerosol mass oxidation flow reactor (OFR). GPF retrofitting was found to greatly decrease primary particulate matter (PM) through removal of eBC, but showed limited partial removal of the minor POA fraction, and had no detectable effect on either NMOC emissions (absolute emission factors or relative composition) or SOA production. In all tests, overall primary and secondary PM and NMOC emissions were dominated by the engine cold start, i. e. before thermal activation of the catalytic after-treatment system. Differences were found in the bulk compositional properties of SOA produced by the OFR and the SC (O : C and H : C ratios), while the SOA yields agree within our uncertainties, with a tendency for lower SOA yields in SC experiments. A few aromatic compounds are found to dominate the NMOC emissions (primarily benzene, toluene, xylene isomers and C 3 -benzenes). A large fraction (> 0. 5) of the SOA production was explained by those compounds, based on investigation of reacted NMOC mass and comparison with SOA yield curves of toluene, o-xylene and 1, 2, 4 -trimethylbenzene determined in our OFR within this study. Remaining differences in the obtained SOA yields may result from diverse reasons including aging conditions, unaccounted-for precursors and differences in SOA yields of aromatic hydrocarbons with different degrees of substitution, as well as experimental uncertainties in the assessment of particle and vapor wall losses...|$|R
30|$|In this research, {{to obtain}} the {{attenuation}} properties of IBC, in vivo experiments with 7 volunteers were carried out in a frequency band range from 10  kHz to 500  kHz, and the results have indicated that human body channel <b>attenuation</b> can be <b>equivalent</b> to a band-pass filter characteristic. In addition, the equalizer which effectively reduced ISI was designed according to the frequency-selective fading characteristic {{of the human body}} channel. Then an IBC base band modulation simulation model was established based on human body channel characteristic, and the BER of different modulation methods were also evaluated and compared with each other. The results indicated that when higher band utilization was not required, FSK had lower BER and could better conform to the requirements of an IBC system. Moreover, FSK would not easily be affected by a change of channel parameters. To investigate the energy consumption of the MAC layer based on TDMA and CSMA/CA, a multi-node physiological signal monitor and transmission system was designed using the proposed band-pass filter characteristics of the human body to compare the power consumption of MAC layer based on TDMA and CSMA/CA. An FSK modulation-demodulation method was applied in the system. The outcome showed that TDMA had lower power consumption, but the number of nodes was easier to change under CSMA/CA because each node had the same priority. Considering the different priorities of human physiological signals and the lower power consumption, an FSK method with TDMA is more suitable for human communication in health care systems.|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Subsonic Technology Noise Reduction Program goal is {{to reduce}} {{aircraft}} noise by 10 EPNdB by the year 2000 relative, to 1992 technology. The improvement goal for nacelle attenuation is 25 % relative to 1992 technology by 1997 and 50 % by 2000. The Advanced Turbofan Duct Liner Concepts Task work by Boeing presented in this document was in support of these goals. The basis for the technical approach was a Boeing study conducted in 1993 - 94 under NASA/FAA contract NAS 1 - 19349, Task 6, investigating broadband acoustic liner concepts. As {{a result of this}} work, it was recommended that linear double layer, linear and perforate triple layer, parallel element, and bulk absorber liners be further investigated to improve nacelle attenuations. NASA LaRC also suggested that "adaptive" liner concepts that would allow "in-situ" acoustic impedance control also be considered. As a result, bias flow and high-temperature liner concepts were also added to the investigation. The major conclusion from the above studies is that improvements in nacelle liner average acoustic impedance characteristics alone will not result in 25 % increased nacelle noise reduction relative to 1992 technology. Nacelle design advancements currently being developed by Boeing are expected to add 20 - 40 % more acoustic lining to hardwall regions in current inlets, which is predicted to result in and additional 40 - 80 % attenuation improvement. Similar advancements are expected to allow 10 - 30 % more acoustic lining in current fan ducts with 10 - 30 % more attenuation expected.

40|$|Using a {{numerical}} approach, we explore wave-induced fluid flow effects in partially saturated porous rocks {{in which the}} gas-water saturation patterns are governed by mesoscopic heterogeneities associated with the dry frame properties. The link between the dry frame properties and the gas saturation {{is defined by the}} assumption of capillary pressure equilibrium, which in the presence of heterogeneity implies that neighbouring regions can exhibit different levels of saturation. To determine the <b>equivalent</b> <b>attenuation</b> and phase velocity of the synthetic rock samples considered in this study, we apply {{a numerical}} upscaling procedure, which permits to take into account mesoscopic heterogeneities associated with the dry frame properties as well as spatially continuous variations of the pore fluid properties. The multiscale nature of the fluid saturation is taken into account by locally computing the physical properties of an effective fluid, which are then used for the larger-scale simulations. We consider two sets of numerical experiments to analyse such effects in heterogeneous partially saturated porous media, where the saturation field is determined by variations in porosity and clay content, respectively. In both cases we also evaluate the seismic responses of corresponding binary, patchy-type saturation patterns. Our results indicate that significant attenuation and modest velocity dispersion effects take place in this kind of media for both binary patchy-type and spatially continuous gas saturation patterns and in particular in the presence of relatively small amounts of gas. The numerical experiments also show that the nature of the gas distribution patterns is a critical parameter controlling the seismic responses of these environments, since attenuation and velocity dispersion effects are much more significant and occur over a broader saturation range for binary patchy-type gas-water distributions. This analysis therefore suggests that the physical mechanisms governing partial saturation should be accounted for when analysing seismic data in a poroelastic framework. In this context, heterogeneities associated with the dry frame properties, which do not play important roles in wave-induced fluid flow processes per se, should be taken into account since they may determine the kind of gas distribution pattern taking place in the porous roc...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{regulation}} and environment {{of star formation}} across cosmic time is critical to tracing the build-up of mass in the Universe and the interplay between the stars and gas that are the constituents of galaxies. Three studies are presented in this thesis, each examining a different aspect of star formation at a specific epoch. The first study {{presents the results of}} a photometric and spectroscopic survey of 321 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at z = 3 to investigate systematically the relationship between Lyα emission and stellar populations. Lyα equivalent widths were calculated from rest-frame UV spectroscopy and optical/near-infrared/ Spitzer photometry was used in population synthesis modeling to derive the key properties of age, dust extinction, star formation rate (SFR), and stellar mass. We directly compare the stellar populations of LBGs with and without strong Lyα emission, where we designate the former group (Lyα equivalent widths greater than 20 Å) as Lyα-emitters (LAEs) and the latter group (Lyα equivalent widths fewer than 20 Å) as non-LAEs. This controlled method of comparing objects from the same UV luminosity distribution represents an improvement over previous studies in which the stellar populations of LBGs and narrowband-selected LAEs were contrasted, where the latter were often intrinsically fainter in broadband filters by an order of magnitude simply due to different selection criteria. Using a variety of statistical tests, we find that Lyα equivalent width and age, SFR, and dust extinction, respectively, are significantly correlated in the sense that objects with strong Lyα emission also tend to be older, lower in star formation rate, and less dusty than objects with weak Lyα emission, or the line in absorption. We accordingly conclude that, within the LBG sample, objects with strong Lyα emission represent a later stage of galaxy evolution in which supernovae-induced outflows have reduced the dust covering fraction. We also examined the hypothesis that the attenuation of Lyα photons is lower than that of the continuum, as proposed by some, but found no evidence to support this picture. The second study focuses specifically on galactic-scale outflowing winds in 72 star-forming galaxies at z = 1 in the Extended Groth Strip. Galaxies were selected from the DEEP 2 survey and follow-up LRIS spectroscopy was obtained covering SiII, CIV, FeII, MgII, and MgI lines in the rest-frame ultraviolet. Using GALEX, HST, and Spitzer imaging available for the Extended Groth Strip, we examine galaxies on a per-object basis in order to better understand both the prevalence of galactic outflows at z = 1 and the star-forming and structural properties of objects experiencing outflows. Gas velocities, measured from the centroids of FeII interstellar absorption lines, are found to span the interval - 217, + 155 km s - 1. We find that approximately 40 % (10 %) of the sample exhibits blueshifted FeII lines at the 1 σ (3 σ) level. We also measure maximal outflow velocities using the profiles of the FeII and MgII lines; we find that MgII frequently traces higher velocity gas than FeII. Using quantitative morphological parameters derived from the HST imaging, we find that mergers are not a prerequisite for driving outflows. More face-on galaxies also show stronger winds than highly inclined systems, consistent with the canonical picture of winds emanating perpendicular to galactic disks. In light of clumpy galaxy morphologies, we develop a new physically-motivated technique for estimating areas corresponding to star formation. We use these area measurements in tandem with GALEX -derived star-formation rates to calculate star-formation rate surface densities. At least 70 % of the sample exceeds a star-formation rate surface density of 0. 1 solar masses yr - 1 kpc - 2, the threshold necessary for driving an outflow in local starbursts. At the same time, the outflow detection fraction of only 40 % in FeII absorption provides further evidence for an outflow geometry that is not spherically symmetric. We see a 3 σ trend between outflow velocity and star-formation rate surface density, but no significant trend between outflow velocity and star-formation rate. Higher resolution data are needed in order to test the scaling relations between outflow velocity and both star-formation rate and star-formation rate surface density predicted by theory. Galactic winds are further explored in the third study of this thesis, where we present a study at z = 1 of the prevalence and kinematics of ultraviolet emission lines from fine-structure FeII* transitions and resonance MgII transitions. Utilizing a multiwavelength dataset of 212 star-forming galaxies, we investigate how the strength and kinematics of FeII* and MgII emission lines vary as a function of galaxy properties. We find that FeII* emission is prevalent in the sample; composite spectra assembled {{on the basis of a}} variety of galaxy properties all show FeII* emission, particularly in the stronger 2396 and 2626 Å lines. This prevalence of emission is in contrast to observations of local galaxies; the lack of FeII* emission in the small star-forming regions targeted by spectroscopic observations at z = 0 may imply that FeII* emission arises in more extended galaxy halos. The strength of FeII* emission is most strongly modulated by star-formation rate, dust <b>attenuation,</b> and [OII] <b>equivalent</b> width, such that systems with lower star-formation rates, lower dust levels, and larger [OII] equivalent widths show stronger FeII* emission. MgII emission, while not observed in a spectral stack of all the data in our sample, is seen in 30 % of individual objects. We find that objects showing MgII emission have preferentially larger [OII] equivalent widths, bluer U-B colors, and lower stellar masses than the sample as a whole. Active galactic nuclei are not likely responsible for the MgII emission in our sample, since we have excluded active galaxies from our dataset. We also do not observe the NeV emission line at 3425 Å characteristic of active galaxies in our co-added spectra. We find that the kinematics of FeII* emission lines are consistent with the systemic velocity. This result does not necessarily imply that these lines arise from star-forming regions, however, as an optically thin galactic wind could show blueshifted and redshifted FeII* emission lines centered around 0 km s - 1. We note that FeII* emission arising from extended gas is consistent with the hypothesis that slit losses are responsible for the lack of FeII* emission in local samples. We propose that dust is primarily responsible for the correlations between FeII* strength and galaxy properties, as objects with lower star-formation rates and larger [OII] equivalent widths also exhibit lower dust attenuations, on average. The strong MgII emission seen in systems with larger [OII] equivalent widths, bluer U-B colors, and lower stellar masses may also be the result of low dust attenuation in these objects. Larger studies composed of high signal-to-noise observations will be critical for testing the hypothesis that dust is the primary modulator of fine-structure and resonance emission...|$|R
