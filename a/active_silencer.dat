50|$|For {{classical}} silencers, the {{signaling pathway}} is relatively simple. Since repression is <b>active,</b> <b>silencer</b> elements target the assembly of GTFs, necessary for transcription of the gene. These silencer elements are mostly located upstream of the gene and can vary between short and long distances. For long-range silencers, {{it has been observed}} that the DNA will form a loop in order to bring the silencer closer to the promoter and loop out the interfering DNA. Silencers also target helicase sites in the DNA that are rich in adenine and thymine (AT) and prone to unwinding the DNA, allowing room to initiate transcription. The inhibited helicase activity leads to the inhibition of transcription. This is commonly seen in the human thyrotropin-β gene promoter. NREs can induce a bend in the promoter region to block interactions, as seen when an NRE binds to Yin-Yang 1 (YY1), and flank regulatory signals or promoter regions as well. When the silencer region is located within an intron, there can be two types of repressions. First, there can be a physical blockage of a splice site. Second, there can be a bend in the DNA that will inhibit RNA processing.|$|E

Exhaust system manufacturers {{have to develop}} new concepts of exhaust systems which comply the noise emission standards without affecting the engine efficiency adversely. An original active exhaust silencer has been developed, based on an electrically controllable valve combined with a buffer volume. The system is able to attenuate the exhaust noise without passive attenuation prior to the <b>active</b> <b>silencer.</b> There have been developed electrical equivalent models to dimension the silencer wherein the engine acoustical characteristics, such as the acoustic impedance and source strength at the exhaust, have been included. A cold engine test rig is developed which generates realistic exhaust noise using compressed air with similar characteristics as an operational engine. The test rig permits to develop new concepts of exhaust systems economically, using low cost materials and standard measurement equipment.

40|$|An <b>active</b> <b>silencer</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} to attenuate combustion engine exhaust noise. The silencer consists of an electrically controlled valve connected to a buer volume. The pulsating ow from the engine is buered in the volume. The valve connected to it is controlled such that only the mean ow passes to the atmosphere. This ow is free from uctuations and consequently free of sound. An iterative learning controller {{has been developed}} to control the active valve. In the control algorithm, non-causal lters are implemented. These lters allow to control systems with high dynamics over a broad frequency range. The <b>active</b> <b>silencer</b> has been experimentally validated on a cold engine simulator, which generates realistic exhaust noise and gas ow using compressed air. The exhaust noise has been reduced in a frequency range starting from 5 Hz until 800 Hz. Depending on the rotational speed of the engine, the typical reductions ranges from 13 dB to 24 dB. status: accepte...|$|E

40|$|International audienceActive {{noise control}} is often {{concerned}} with the strong attenuation of single or multiple tonal noise disturbances which may have unknown and time varying frequencies. Currently in applications, adaptive feed-forward compensation is used which {{requires the use of}} an additional transducer and introduces an instability risk due to a positive internal coupling. However for these types of noise a feedback approach can be efficiently used and this will be illustrated in this paper. One considers the case of two tonal disturbances located in two distinct frequency regions subject to frequency variations within a given range as well the case of interferences between tonal disturbances of very close frequencies. The objective is to minimize the measured residual noise in a predefined location. These problems occurs often in ventilation systems (<b>active</b> <b>silencers).</b> To solve these problems robust and adaptive solutions are considered. A robust controller design using sensitivity function shaping is considered. The maximum achievable attenuation is inverse proportional to the range of frequency variations of the tonal disturbances. To further improve the performance an add-on direct adaptive feedback approach using the Internal Model Principle and the Youla Kucera parametrization is considered. The adaptive approach allows both to improve the performance within the given frequency ranges as well as to extend the admissible domain of frequencies variations. Experimental results obtained on a relevant test bench will illustrate the performance of the two designs...|$|R
40|$|Forced {{air cooling}} systems, {{such as an}} {{airconditioning}} system produce noise. For a pleasant living environment, this noise is undesirable. A way to suppress produced noise is reducing the sound in the duct where the air flows through afterwards. a his report handles the noise reduction in an <b>active</b> duct <b>silencer</b> {{by the use of}} a discrete feedback controller. Models of the involved processes are made. With these models and suitable choices of weighting functions, an H 2 optimal controller is calculated. The controller is reduced taking into account the sensitivity of the closed loop process. Stability and performance are maintained in this way. Finally the controller is implemented on the system and a validation has been made to indicate the active noise cancellation that could be obtained with feedback control...|$|R

40|$|Active {{resonator}} silencers {{are particularly}} effective in attenuating low-frequency noise, practically applied since {{more than ten}} years. The essential electroacoustic components such as loudspeaker, microphone and electronics are moderately priced. But regarding the complete products, such as silencers in ducts of ventilation systems mostly produced in small series, it often leads to uneconomical solutions caused by {{the costs of the}} necessary cabinets. Usually the cabinets are manufactured from metal sheets to comply with the requirements of sound insulation as well as to enclose the air volume as one of the crucial resonator elements. In or-der to reduce the manufacturing expenses small or flat cabinets are required. But a small volume contradicts the performance of the active silencers. Thus, the applicability of lean <b>active</b> <b>silencer</b> was investigated with respect to lean transducers and optimized volume of the cabinets. Starting from the point of an application with standard active resonator cassettes, the specific requirements and restrictions of this type of silencers are presented. The scope of appropriate designed transducers is discussed.

The Silencer takes you one gigantic {{step closer to}} this goal. The disturbing influence of vibration has its origins in buildings, in people moving through the room and also in airbourne sound input from the loud-speakers. All these sources of disturbance lead to a distorted rendition of audiosignals. The <b>Silencer’s</b> <b>active</b> damping system suppresses these distur-bances masterfully, delivering spectacular results that are simply not available with passive vibration isolation systems.

40|$|Rev-erbA alpha is {{an orphan}} steroid {{receptor}} that {{is expressed in}} skeletal muscle. Rev-erbA alpha binds to single/tandem copies of an AGGTCA motif, is transcribed on the noncoding strand of the c-erbA-alpha gene locus, and is postulated to modulate the thyroid hormone (T- 3) response. T- 3 induces terminal muscle differentiation and regulates fiber type composition via direct activation of the muscle-specific myoD gene family (e. g. myoD, myogenin). The myoD gene family can direct the fate of mesodermal cell lineages and activate muscle differentiation. Hence we investigated the expression and physiological role of Rev-erbA alpha during myogenesis. We observed abundant levels of Rev-erbA alpha mRNA in dividing C 2 C 12 myoblasts, which were suppressed when the cells differentiated into postmitotic multinucleated myotubes. This decrease in Rev-erbA alpha mRNA correlated {{with the appearance of}} muscle-specific mRNAs (e. g, myogenin and alpha-actin). Constitutive overexpression of full length Rev-erbA alpha cDNA in the myogenic cells completely abolished differentiation, suppressed myoD mRNA levels, and abrogated the induction of myogenin mRNA. We then demonstrated that 1) GAL 4 -Rev-erbA alpha chimeras that contain the 2 ̆ 7 AB 2 ̆ 7 region and lack the 2 ̆ 7 E 2 ̆ 7 region activated transcription of GAL 4 response elements in the presence of 8 -Br-cAMP and 2) the ligand-binding domain (LED) contains an <b>active</b> transcriptional <b>silencer.</b> Overexpression of Rev-erbA alpha(Delta AB) in myogenic cells had no impact on the ability of these cells to morphologically or biochemically differentiate. Furthermore, this orphan receptor 1) down-regulated thyroid hormone receptor (TR) /T- 3 mediated transciptional activity from the myogenin promoter and thyroid hormone response element (TRE) and 2) disrupted TR homodimer and TR/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer formation on a number of TREs found in the myoD gene family. In conclusion, Rev-erbA alpha functions as a negative regulator of myogenesis by targeting the expression of the myoD gene family. The mechanism of action may involve inhibition of functional TR/RXR heterodimer formation on critical TREs and dominant trans-repression of gene expression...|$|R
40|$|RVR/Rev-erb beta/BD 73 is {{an orphan}} steroid {{receptor}} {{that has no}} known ligand in the "classical' sense. RVR binds as a monomer to an element which consists of an A/T-rich sequence upstream of the consensus hexameric half-site. However, RVR does not activate transcription and blocks transactivation of this element by ROR/RZR. The mechanism of RVR action remains obscure, hence we used the GAL 4 hybrid system to identify and characterize an <b>active</b> transcriptional <b>silencer</b> in the ligand binding domain (LBD) of RVR. Rigorous deletion and mutational analysis demonstrated that this repressor domain is encoded by amino acids 416 - 449 of RVR. Furthermore, we demonstrated that efficient repression {{is dependent on the}} so-called LBD-specific signature motif, (F/W) AKxxxxFxxLxxxDQxxLL (which spans loop 3 - 4 and helix 4) and helix 5 (H 5; identified in the crystal structures of the steroid receptor LBDs). Although RVR is expressed in many adult tissues, including skeletal muscle, and during embryogenesis, its physiological function in differentiation and mammalian development remains unknown. Since other 'orphans', e. g. COUP-TF II and Rev-erbA alpha, have been demonstrated to regulate muscle and adipocyte differentiation, we investigated the expression and functional role of RVR during mouse myogenesis. In C 2 C 12 myogenic cells, RVR mRNA was detected in proliferating myoblasts and was suppressed when the cells were induced to differentiate into post-mitotic, multinucleated myotubes by serum withdrawal. This decrease in RVR mRNA correlated with the appearance of muscle-specific markers (e. g. myogenin mRNA). RVR 'loss of function' studies by constitutive over-expression of a dominant negative RVR delta E resulted in increased levels of p 21 Cip 1 /Waf 1 and myogenin mRNAs after serum withdrawal. Time course studies indicated that expression of RVR delta E mRNA results in the precocious induction and accumulation of myogenin and p 21 mRNAs after serum withdrawal. In addition, we demonstrated that over-expression of the COUP-TF II and Rev-erbA alpha receptors in C 2 C 12 cells completely blocked induction of p 21 mRNA after serum withdrawal. In conclusion, our studies identified a potent transcriptional repression domain in RVR, characterized critical amino acids within the silencing region and provide evidence for the physiological role of RVR during myogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Active {{headsets}} {{have been}} on the market for years and now it is time for something else to enter the stage. The technology of active noise reduction can for exmple also be used in ventilation systems for reducing ventilation noise. An active control system principally consists of four important components, namely the downstream error microphone, the upstream detection or reference microphone, the digital signal processor (DSP) and a loudspeaker. The upstream reference microphone listen to the primary ventilation noise and sends it to the DSP which makes a phase shift to the signal and sends it to the loudspeaker. The loudspeaker sends out the opposite waveform of the incoming one and reduce the primary ventilation noise. To adjust the sound radrated from the loudspeaker so low reidual soundlevel is obtained a downstream error microphone is used. The residual sound is a sum of the primary ventilation noise and the secondary sound generated by the loudspeaker. In noice reduction systems today there are not many systems that use the <b>active</b> technology. Passive <b>silencers</b> have low noise attenuation at low frequencies, approximately under 250 Hz, and that is why the active technology should be used. The aim with a <b>silencer</b> based on <b>active</b> noise control is to improve the reduction of the low frequency noise below 250 Hz. In this project we also have a passive component that reduce the higher frequencies. The active control system should make the system better in the low frequency range. The use of both active and passive noise reduction at the same time makes an even better system and the goal with this work was to implement a system with high performance to a low cost. + 4670833496...|$|R
