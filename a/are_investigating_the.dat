5|$|Although {{the venom}} {{of a few}} spider and {{scorpion}} species can be very dangerous to humans, medical researchers <b>are</b> <b>investigating</b> <b>the</b> use of these venoms {{for the treatment of}} disorders ranging from cancer to erectile dysfunction. The medical industry also uses the blood of horseshoe crabs as a test for the presence of contaminant bacteria. Mites can cause allergies in humans, transmit several diseases to humans and their livestock, and are serious agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|Researchers <b>are</b> <b>investigating</b> <b>the</b> {{clinical}} significance of c-KIT mutations in AML. These are prevalent, and potentially clinically relevant {{because of the}} availability of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and sunitinib that can block the activity of c-KIT pharmacologically. It is expected that additional markers (e.g., RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53) that have consistently been associated with an inferior outcome will soon be included in these recommendations. The prognostic importance of other mutated genes (e.g., DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2) is less clear.|$|E

5|$|The uses of {{bioluminescence}} by animals include counter-illumination camouflage, mimicry {{of other}} animals, for example to lure prey, and signalling to other individuals {{of the same}} species, such as to attract mates. In the laboratory, luciferase-based systems are used in genetic engineering and for biomedical research. Other researchers <b>are</b> <b>investigating</b> <b>the</b> possibility of using bioluminescent systems for street and decorative lighting, and a bioluminescent plant has been created.|$|E

5|$|Walter Skinner's {{old college}} friend, Hollywood {{producer}} Wayne Federman, {{is involved in}} a film project about the FBI. During Federman's research phase, Skinner gives him access to Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, who <b>are</b> <b>investigating</b> <b>the</b> attempted murder of Cardinal O'Fallon. Federman tags along and constantly interrupts the agents. While searching the catacombs of O'Fallon's church, Mulder finds the remains of Micah Hoffman, a missing 1960s counter-culturalist. Searching Hoffman's apartment, they find bombs and counterfeiting tools, as well as forged gospel of Mary Magdalene. Mulder and Federman return to the church and search the catacombs, finding several skeletons and pieces of the forged gospel. Federman wanders off and stumbles upon animated bones, who attempt to assemble a shattered piece of pottery. He panics and leaves the scene.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and {{her mother}} visit her brother Bill and his {{pregnant}} wife Tara around Christmas time. Scully answers the phone, and {{the person on the}} other line, who sounds just like her dead sister Melissa, tells her that someone needs her help. Scully traces the call to a nearby home in San Diego where a group of cops <b>are</b> <b>investigating</b> <b>the</b> suicide of a woman, Roberta Sim. The lead detective, Kresge, tells Scully that it was impossible for Roberta to have dialed, as she died before the telephone call was made. That night after dinner Scully reveals to her mother that due to her abduction and cancer she is unable to bear children. Scully flashes back to when as a child, she hid her pet rabbit from her brother in a lunchbox, only for it to suffocate and die. Scully receives another telephone call from the same person on her cell phone, which was once again made from the Sim home. Roberta's husband, Marshall, is meeting with two dark-suited men inside his house and has no desire to listen to and help Scully figure out what is going on.|$|E

Salinger's and Whitman's investigation takes them from Berlin to Milan, where the IBBC assassinates Umberto Calvini, an arms manufacturer who is an Italian prime ministerial candidate. The bank's assassin diverts suspicion to a local assassin with political connections, who is promptly killed by a corrupt policeman. Salinger and Whitman get a lead on the second assassin, but the corrupt policeman shows up again and orders {{them out of the}} country. At the airport they are able to check the security camera footage for clues on the whereabouts on the bank's assassin, and follow a suspect to New York City.|$|E
