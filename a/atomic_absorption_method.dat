40|$|A new, <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> {{spectrophotometric}} <b>method</b> for {{serum iron}} and iron-binding capacity is described, which utilizes 20 % (w/v) TCA plus heating at 90 #{ 176 }for 15 mm. This procedure liberates the ferric iron; precipitates the protein, facilitating removal by centrifugation; and avoids significant interferences by contaminating hemoglobin iron. The method is highly specific, accurate, {{and has the}} additional feature of requiring less time than most colorimetric or <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>methods</b> employing chelation and extraction. IN’lOST of the spectrophotometric methods for serum or plasma iron determinations suffer from {{at least one of}} three undesirable features: (1) low sensitivity of the color reaction employed, (2) turbidity in the final color solution, and (3) nonspecific background absorbance in the color solution (1). <b>Atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> spectrophotometry not only over-comes these problems, but it additionally has greater specificity and accuracy. Thus, various workers have used <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> technics for the determination of iron in serum or plasma, and a variety of methods (2 - 4) have been developed to that end. Usually, the iron content was determined on undiluted plasma or a 1 : 1 dilution of plasma and deionized water. However, the high protein content of the atomized samples frequently gave erratic results. In addition, it was impossible to distinguish between serum ferric iron and hemoglobin ferrous iron in the sample.

The establishment of the simple determination of molybdenum content in serum was conducted. The effect of the matrix modifier to use for the direct determination of a trace amount of molybdenum in serum by graphite furnace <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>method</b> (GF-AAS) was considered. For the determination of molybdenum in serum, :Mg (NO 3) 2, Pd+Mg (NO 3) 2 or BaF 2 as a matrix modifier were used and their fundamental analytical conditions were examined. Before atomizing and measuring molybdenum in serum, {{it was necessary to}} ash the organic matter contained in serum at a high　temperature to remove interference materials such as human serum protein. To get the stability of the absorbance of molybdenum and to remove the interference material coexisting in serum, the addition of Pd+Mg (NO 3) 2, BaF 2 as a matrix modifier was needed at the ashing temperature 1, 800 ℃, 1, 700 ℃, respectively. To examine the influence of the matrix interference between the calibration curve method and the standard addition method, their slopes were compared. Because the slope between the calibration curve method and standard addition method almost agreed, the addition of BaF 2 as a　matrix modifier was thought to be removed matrix interference in serum.

A method has now been developed for solvent extraction of tungsten, making rapid determination of tungsten at low concentrations possible.

This system was effectively used for the extraction of gold from cyanide solutioins (2). Even in aqueous solutions, phospho-tungstates give greater sensitivity (37 µg/ml for 1 % absorption) compared to simple tungstates (63 µg/ml for 1 % absorption). Standard tungsten solutions for extraction studies were prepared by converting aqueous solutions of sodium tungstate to sodium phospho-tungstate by boiling with ortho phosphoric acid.
