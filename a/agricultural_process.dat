5000|$|The term “riddle drum” is of Southern English {{origin and}} is tied {{in with the}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>process.</b> In England {{winnowing}} corn is colloquially called [...] "Riddling", and until the 20th century winnowing sieves were made by stretching an animal skin across a wooden hoop. Holes were then burnt into the skin at close intervals of appropriate size for the corn to be sieved (barley, wheat) and were known as riddle sieves. In Cornwall riddle drums were called crowdy crawn. John Davey of Zennor (1812-1891), the last native speaker of the Cornish language, describes, [...] "a wooden hoop covered with sheep-skin, used for taking up corn. Sometimes used as a tambourine, then called crowdy-crawn." [...] “Crowdy” in the Cornish language means, [...] "fiddle playing" [...] and “crawn” means [...] "animal skin". Riddle Sieves were also used in Ireland and were called, [...] "riddles," [...] or [...] "English sieves.".|$|E
5000|$|According to Leroux, human {{excrement}} has remarkable fertilising properties, which society {{fails to}} harness. The human waste that is otherwise discarded would fertilise agricultural production sufficient to cover society's progressively increasing food consumption. Leroux posits {{the existence of}} a natural law dependent on the circulation of human excrement back through the <b>agricultural</b> <b>process</b> and which maintains a necessary balance between soil fertility and inexorable population growth. In the Revue de l'ordre social (No. 1, 1850, p. 6), Leroux responded to his critics, summing up his theory as follows: [...] "Si les hommes étaient croyants, savants, religieux, ajoute-t-il, au lieu de rire, comme ils le font, du socialisme, ils professeraient avec respect et vénération la doctrine du circulus. Chacun recueillerait religieusement son fumier pour le donner à l’état, c’est-à-dire au percepteur, en guise d’impôt ou de contribution personelle. La production agricole serait immédiatement doublée, et la misère disparaîtrait du globe" [...] (If men were believers, learned, religious, then, rather than laughing at socialism, as they do, they would profess the doctrine of circulus with respect and veneration. Each would religiously collect his dung to give it to the state, that is, to the tax-collector, by way of an impost or personal contribution. Agricultural production would instantly be doubled, and poverty would vanish from the globe).|$|E

5000|$|In 2007, the United Nations {{reported}} on [...] "Organic Agriculture and Food Security", stating that using organic and sustainable agriculture {{could be used}} as a tool to reach global food security without expanding land usage and reducing environmental impacts. Another way to define sustainable agriculture is to give attention to the [...] "human and environmental aspects," [...] because of the turn to a more unsustainable way of farming in U.S. agriculture. During the Great Depression in the United States many farming families were living in subhuman and hungry conditions and treated [...] "sustainability as a resource-input and food-output equation." [...] Though conditions have improved, the farming has not as much done so. There has been evidence provided by developing nations from the early 2000s stating that when people in their communities are not factored into the <b>agricultural</b> <b>process</b> that serious harm is done. Although global food security would most likely not drastically fall, these practices would impact, first hand, local, rural farming communities, making them unable to feed themselves and their families. The social scientist, Charles Kellogg has stated that, [...] "In a final effort, exploited people pass their suffering to the land." [...] This turn to more unsustainable farming has seen suffering for many people. For if something is sustainable, it should be that way in all aspects of it, not just the crop yield or soil health.

5000|$|Frame {{drumming}} {{has been}} around since neolithic times developing across countries and regions into quite unique instruments with their own variants of drum, playing methods and rhythms. The Riddle Drum is quite distinct from other frame drums today and not musically interchangeable with them. Frame drum skins are thin and tight to create high harmonics when playing with the fingers, also frame drummers tend to play {{around the edges of the}} drum for a higher tone and a prime quality sought in a drum is lengthy resonance. Frame drumming is also quite a sophisticated form of drumming and can be difficult to learn, while Riddle Drumming is reasonably easy, so much more accessible as folk instruments than frame drums. Riddle Drum skins tend to be thicker and looser than those of frame drum giving them a bass tone, also they tend to be hit near the centre of the drum and the free hand pressed against the skin to reduce resonance. The reason the unique playing style developed is most likely because thin, tight skins would not survive the <b>agricultural</b> <b>process</b> and the other uses Riddle Sieves were put too, [...] "filling sacks with grain, holding wool, when carded and ready for the spinning wheel, or feathers plucked three time a year.". Surviving examples of Riddle Sieves from Scotland, France, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire and Nepal all show heavy wear and tear, skins stretched out of shape from carrying heavy weights, holes tearing into others holes and some with long tears across the skin sown up. So Riddle Drumming became quite distinct from other frame drumming. It also adopted a unique double ended stick held in a pencil grip (or sometimes a leather thong) with the player striking the drum in series of glancing blows (sometimes with both ends of the stick) rather than directly striking the drum with one end of a stick as done in most forms of stick drumming. Stick drumming may have emerged because the stretching and wear and tear on the sieves made them unplayable with the fingers. Also the nature of traditional English music, such as jigs and hornpipes, which require a heavy accentuated beat to inform the dancers when to place their feet.|$|E
50|$|The last {{old world}} regime in crisis was Russia; {{they were the}} last {{underdeveloped}} great powers that were bombarded by state change {{as well as the}} loss of status in the international arena (Skocpol 1979, 81). The Russian imperial state was in crisis due to their multiple defeats in previous wars. In the 19th century, he state developed a competition to be the dominant power in the European state system (83-84). The population during that time was living in cities was 8 to 10 percent or 60 million (82). During this era, there were two types of landlord/serf relations that prevailed and often combined in one estate or intermixed in one locale; black soil provinces, and infertile soil(83). Those who worked in the black soil provinces performed the services on the lord’s demesne for one half or more of each week (83). The second system had hard conditions and made the serfs face primitive conditions making their job difficult. The second crisis was the Crimean debacle and reform of Western Europe during the 19th century (83). Imperial Russia was on their defense when it came to controlling the Russian Sea. Russia appeared on the global sphere {{to be one of the}} strongest single powers in 1815 but after 1848 they lost their position as a great power in the international arena (84). The Crimean war handed the severe blow to Russia’s strength and further displayed Russia’s inferiority to other countries in this moment in time (84). The military defeats made the citizens of the state lose confidence in their government forcing them to reform (85). The first sign of reform was emancipation of the serfs, directly limiting nobility’s autocracy, further dissolving the imperial state. The third crisis that occurred was the weakness of the landed nobility; this group was the middle class between the serf economy and the imperial state (85). The Russian dominant class was created with the financial funding of the peasantry through the state, the landed nobility was economically weak and dependent on the imperial authorities to control the state (87). The fourth crisis in the old regime was the state guided industrialization that occurred after the post-Crimean reform era, the goal of the state was to spur industrialization from the upper class and did not come until after some initial experiments’ with laissez faire capitalist policies (90). Russia was open to foreign trade and investment believing that they could acquire modern industrial, transportation materials and techniques to speed up the <b>agricultural</b> <b>process.</b> The state didn’t predict the possibility of trade and investments leading to the furtherance of Russia’s demise; the agricultural productivity declined, the price for grain dropped, the need for imports and indebtedness grew (90). Russia was further dissolved by the war and military measures cost the state as well as created famines in 1891. The Russian economy was tied to Europe’s finances, the western market contracted Russian’s industry, and grown rapidly in the 1890s, but the crisis created a long recession. Despite the declining economy, Russia still functioned as a competing Great Power in the European arena (94). Yet, the state still couldn’t move forward because of the collapse of the agricultural system. The last crisis that occurred in the old world regime was the impact of war. In the 20th century, Russia was caught in the middle of an “crosscurrent” between the international world and the Europe (94). The states goal was to maintain their power and status as the Great Power and the only way this could be done was through war. The biggest war Russia ever became involved in was World War 1, engulfing all of the European states forcing Russia to protect their status and assets (95). The consequences led Russia further downward because of the military defeats, economic and administrative chaos (96).|$|E
