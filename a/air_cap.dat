5000|$|Bubble Wrap (originally <b>Air</b> <b>Cap)</b> is a trademarked {{brand of}} Sealed Air Corporation that {{includes}} numerous cushioning products made from bubble wrap. The brand {{is produced by}} the Product Care division of Sealed Air. Both the Bubble Wrap brand and product were introduced in 1960, with the launch of Sealed Air. [...] Although the brand was originally used for the packaging of IBM computers, Sealed Air now does most of its Bubble Wrap business in the food packaging industry.|$|E
5000|$|The idea {{of such a}} {{centralised}} control room is surprisingly old; {{it can be found}} in science fiction as early as The Struggle for Empire (1900). Early versions were used in the Second World War; according to Rear Admiral Cal Laning, the idea for a command information center was taken “specifically, consciously, and directly” from the spaceship Directrix in the Lensman novels of E. E. Smith, Ph.D., and influenced by the works of his friend and collaborator Robert Heinlein, a retired American naval officer. After the numerous losses during the various naval battles off Guadalcanal during the war of attrition that was {{part and parcel of the}} Solomon Islands campaign and the Battle of Guadalcanal, the United States Navy employed operational analysis, determined many of their losses were due to procedure and disorganization, and implemented the Combat Information Centers, building on what was initially called [...] "radar plot" [...] according to an essay [...] "CIC Yesterday and Today" [...] by the Naval Historical Center. That same article points out that in 1942 radar, radar procedure, battle experiences, needs, and the CIC all grew up together as needs developed and experience was gained and training spread, all in fits and starts, beginning with the earliest radar uses in the Pacific battles starting with the Coral Sea, when radar gave rise to the first tentative attempt to vector an <b>Air</b> <b>CAP</b> to approaching Japanese flights, maturing some before the Battle of Midway, where post-battle analysis of Coral Sea's results had given more confidence in the ability and to the process and the desire was bolstered by new procedures giving their measure of added confidence.|$|E

40|$|The jet bores (16) in the cap have a spacing (12) from a plane (15) {{extending}} through the atomising bore (14) {{at right angles}} to the direction of application. This ensures a spatial and temporal separation of the atomisation and jet formation. The spacing comes to between 20 mm and 300 mm, and preferably between 50 mm and 150 mm. Each <b>air</b> <b>cap</b> cheek may have at least two jet bores with different spacing. USE - Atomisation cap is used to form spray for application on liquid to surface.

40|$|Conventional {{automotive}} {{spray gun}} {{is widely used}} in the automotive industries for coating and is especially popular among small and medium industries due to its low cost and maintenance. However studies showed that it also causes overspray of paint that affect the hygiene factor concerning health and less cost effective when usage of spray is not properly utilized. Various methods {{have been used to}} study the efficiency of the spray through simulation software and lab approach. In this work, the simulations of the spray paint are performed from the <b>air</b> <b>cap</b> of the spray gun and continue until the flat spray surface. The simulations are performed using ANSYS CFX Version 14. 5 based on the Taguchi method. The Taguchi method used in this study implemented the L’ 9 orthogonal array, since this case study consists of 3 level and 3 factor. This simulation utilize paint as a non-Newtonian fluid taking into consideration the concentration of paint as the additional variable in [kg/m 3], air velocity at the inlet of atomizer, spreader and paint inlet and lastly the recommended distance (200 mm to 250 mm) and spray angle (90 ° to the spray surface area) as suggested by the spray manufacturers. Results show that the spray angle is perpendicular to the surface area, the spray pattern has a better concentration of paint compared to when the angle is arced 45 ° from the spray surface. Furthermore, at arced 45 ° from the spray surface, the overspray can be seen over the intended spray surface. The most desired simulation result was achieved with, air velocity 1 m/s, paint velocity 2 m/s at a distance between <b>air</b> <b>cap</b> and spray surface is 200 mm...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the {{assessment}} of the thermal and mechanical properties of Invar steel coatings, deposited using electric are spraying, and the correlation of these properties to the spray parameters and processes used to offer coatings with characteristics appropriate to the requirements of tools used in the fabrication of precision polymer matrix composite work pieces. In particular, two processing methods, inert and air atomization, and three are spray gun configurations (<b>air</b> <b>cap</b> design) were evaluated. The low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) properties of Invar are maintained in the spray-deposited coatings using both high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) and air-atomized are spraying, although HVOF coatings have significantly lower CTE and greater durability than those deposited by are spraying. The mechanical properties of the coatings are low compared to bulk Invar, regardless of the spray parameters and hardware used. Inert are spraying affords more consistent coating characteristics but this comes with a compromised durability.

Pellets obtained following the optimal operating conditions (defined in a pre-formulation study) were film coated with the acrylic polymer Eudragit L 30 D in order to produce a model formulation consisting of enteric polymer- coated pellets containing ibuprofen. During its preparation, the formulation showed no degradation of the drug; moreover, a low percentage of residual humidity was obtained, indicating that this system is very efficient for the production of highly stable formulations.

40|$|Coated microneedle patches have {{demonstrated}} potential for effective, minimally invasive, drug and vaccine delivery. To facilitate cost-effective, industrial-scale production of coated microneedle patches, a continuous coating method which utilises conventional pharmaceutical processes {{is an attractive}} prospect. Here, the potential of spray-coating silicon microneedle patches using a conventional film-coating process was evaluated and the key process parameters which impact on coating coalescence and weight were identified by employing a fractional factorial design to coat flat silicon patches. Processing parameters analysed included concentration of coating material, liquid input rate, duration of spraying, atomisation air pressure, gun-to-surface distance and <b>air</b> <b>cap</b> setting. Two film-coating materials were investigated; hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). HPMC readily formed a film-coat on silicon when suitable spray coating parameter settings were determined. CMC films required {{the inclusion of a}} surfactant (1 %, w/w Tween 80) to facilitate coalescence of the sprayed droplets on the silicon surface. Spray coating parameters identified by experimental design, successfully coated 280 μm silicon microneedle arrays, producing an intact film-coat, which follows the contours of the microneedle array without occlusion of the microneedle shape. This study demonstrates a novel method of coating microneedle arrays with biocompatible polymers using a conventional film-coating process. It is the first study to indicate the thickness and roughness of coatings applied to microneedle arrays. The study also highlights the importance of identifying suitable processing parameters when film coating substrates of micron dimensions. The ability of a fractional factorial design to identify these critical parameters is also demonstrated. The polymer coatings applied in this study can potentially be drug loaded for intradermal drug and vaccine delivery...|$|E
