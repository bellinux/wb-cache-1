We have designed the hydro-mechanical forming in which Al sheet was drawn to a kind of preform step following gas blow forming for final accurate geometry. In order to judge a formability enhancement of Al sheet in terms of forming process, model geometry came from a practical <b>automotive</b> <b>part</b> which had quite depth with complicated curvatures, which was proven that a single sheet forming could not gave a successful part. Experimentally, we succeeded to make the model part with accurate dimension. The optimum forming conditions for respective forming steps were considered most important technical features of this hydro-mechanical. Also, the effort to avoid detrimental microstructure evolutions was given and discussed for a practical application...|$|R
