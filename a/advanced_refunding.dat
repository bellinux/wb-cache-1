40|$|States, municipalities, {{and other}} {{regional}} or local public bodies {{have the authority}} to issue debt securities, the interest on which is tax exempt under federal regulations. As a consequence, the interest which these entities must pay on their bonds is usually below the rate on U. S. government securities of identical maturity. Arbitrage bonds [...] issued by a municipality {{to take advantage of this}} differential [...] are not generally permitted, with the exception of <b>Advance</b> <b>Refunding.</b> <b>Advance</b> <b>Refunding</b> is the process by which the proceeds of a municipal bond issue are invested in Treasury securities and these securities placed in a trust fund to pay when due the principal and interest on debt previously outstanding. To limit the arbitrage profit to the municipality engaging in <b>Advance</b> <b>Refunding,</b> the U. S. government has strictly limited the amount of the new issue which may be invested at a yield rate greater than the rate obtained on the new municipal debt. This article, after discussing the appropriate government regulations, provides a simple example of <b>Advance</b> <b>Refunding</b> and a theoretical analysis of a simple refunding scheme. It then describes a two stage optimization procedure which will maximize the savings to the municipality which chooses to <b>Advance</b> <b>Refund</b> its debt. Results of this new procedure, which first minimizes the amount of Treasury securities and then provides an optimal maturity schedule for the new debt, are compared with actual refundings using other programs. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 replaced the 15 -percent tax rate for individual taxpayers with a 10 -percent rate. To stimulate the economy quickly, the act provided for an <b>advance</b> <b>refund</b> in 2001. Between July and December 2001, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), working with the Department of the Treasury's Financial Management Service (FMS), mailed out 86 million <b>advance</b> <b>refund</b> checks totaling $ 36. 4 billion. IRS spent $ 104 million to run the <b>advance</b> tax <b>refund</b> program, and FMS spent $ 34 million to issue checks; IRS expects to spend another $ 12 million during fiscal year 2002. Overall, GAO found that IRS and FMS {{did a good job}} carrying out the program. However, the <b>advance</b> <b>refunds</b> and related rate reduction led to increased errors during the 2002 tax-filing season because of taxpayer confusion about the tax credit. In GAO's view, an independent review of the computer programming used to carry out a major effort such as the <b>advance</b> tax <b>refund</b> program might help avoid future problems. At the same time, clearer tax return instructions might reduce the number of returns filed in error. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 directed the Treasury to issue <b>advance</b> 2001 tax <b>refunds</b> to individual taxpayers who filed a tax year 2000 return. As a result, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had to identify eligible taxpayers so that checks could be sent to these taxpayers by December 31, 2001. The Department of the Treasury's Financial Management Service was to issue the checks on behalf of IRS, with the first checks to be received {{during the week of}} July 23, 2001. As of September 30, 2001, 84 million taxpayers were to have received $ 36 billion in advance tax funds. IRS offset about $ 2. 1 billion from these <b>advance</b> tax <b>refunds</b> to recover delinquent federal taxes. IRS spent $ 104 million to run the program through September 2001, which included IRS staffing costs as well as the costs associated with contracts, postage, and printing. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration identified two initial problems that affected either the accuracy or timeliness of the <b>advance</b> <b>refund</b> notices. One involved computer programming errors that resulted in 523, 000 taxpayers receiving notices indicating that they would receive larger <b>advance</b> tax <b>refunds</b> than they were entitled to receive. The IG also determined that 5. 3 million taxpayers who had filled their tax returns by the April 16 filing deadline would have delays of up to nine weeks in receiving their <b>advance</b> <b>refund</b> notices. Two problems that continued throughout the <b>advance</b> tax <b>refund</b> period involved (1) undeliverable refund notices and checks due to incorrect addresses and (2) taxpayer difficulties in reaching IRS telephone assistors. Another problem that was quickly identified and corrected during {{the early stages of the}} <b>advance</b> tax <b>refund</b> period involved duplicate checks sent to about 25 taxpayers. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an {{overview}} of the municipal bond market with an emphasis on the numerous embedded contingent claims. Embedded contingent claims include the standard call features, sinking funds, the <b>advance</b> <b>refunding</b> option, the synthetic <b>advance</b> <b>refunding</b> option, the credit risk option (default risk), marketability, and the numerous tax-related events. Municipal bond investors must carefully assess the relative value of these contingent claims before investing in municipal bonds. Also, due to unique risk premiums within the municipal bond market, it is important to carefully structure the municipal bond holdings, paying particular attention to duration, within the context of an overall financial plan. There appears to be a benefit to lengthening the duration of the municipal bond portion of the portfolio. © 199...|$|R

50|$|There is a delay refund scheme {{entitling}} {{passengers to}} a partial or full refund {{of the ticket}} price if a journey is delayed by {{half an hour or}} more. The scheme does not apply on short-distance journeys (tickets less than €2.30) and cases in which the delay is the result of planned cancellations that were announced some days in <b>advance.</b> <b>Refunds</b> are, in general, half the ticket price of a one-way trip after a delay of over 30 minutes, the full ticket price after a delay of one hour or more. That applies to nearly all kinds of tickets. The refund is not considered a monetary compensation for lost time but rather as a reduction in charges where a poor service has been provided.

40|$|The {{federal tax}} {{exemption}} afforded to municipal bonds makes them a desirable investment, but the tax exemption is a costly preference {{in the federal}} tax system, that has caused a loss of 9. 4 billion in federal revenues {{in the fiscal year}} of 1981. Legislation has been enacted to regulate the use of the tax exemption for municipal bonds when their issuers engage in arbitrage practices. Arbitrage bonds are defined under Section 103 (c) of the Internal Revenue Code as municipal securities which are issued for the purpose of investing the majority of the proceeds in higher yielding securities, or to replace funds invested at a higher yield, and disqualifies them from tax exemption. The Internal Revenue Service has established regulations governing municipal arbitrage practices, which is discussed by this Note. This note emphasizes arbitrage regulations which are designed to control problems associated with <b>advance</b> <b>refunding</b> bonds- securities issued and invested for the purpose of retiring a prior, outstanding issue. The Note considers the effects of Revenue Ruling 80 - 328, preventing state housing authorities from simultaneously issuing notes and bonds to finance the same low cost housing projects. It also examines the IRS 2 ̆ 7 s restrictive application of the arbitrage regulations in light of a recent Tax Court decision, State of Washington v. Commissioner, which invalidates an arbitrage regulation prohibiting the recovery of expenses incurred in the issuance of bonds. The author suggests that the effects of Revenue Ruling 80 - 328 concerning state housing construction, and the court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in State of Washington v. Commissioner indicate that the IRS may have exceeded its authority in administering the arbitrage provisions of the Code...|$|R
5000|$|RALs {{began in}} 1985 when Ronald Smith, an Accountant in Virginia Beach, VA started the {{practice}} of <b>Refund</b> <b>Advance</b> Loans at his accounting firm, Action Accounting & Taxes located at 5441 Virginia Beach Blvd. This service of Loans On Tax Refunds was advertised widely through WYAH, TV and on Cox Cable in the Hampton Roads area by Action Accounting & Taxes in 1985, 1986 and 1987. The <b>Advance</b> <b>Refund</b> Loans became a huge business success from the start and a sensation {{in the area in}} 1986 and 1987 and was the first and only firm in the United States that was offering that service according to the IRS. In 1986 a salesman from Charlie Falk's Auto on Virginia Beach Blvd, where today Town Centre now exits, asked Mr. Smith if they could make an arrangement where Action Accounting & Taxes could prepare taxes for customers seeking to purchase cars in order to supplement their down payments on used or new car purchases. Mr. Smith agreed to this idea and {{that was the beginning of}} Loans on Tax Refunds being used in conjunction with car financing and that practice then quickly spread throughout the area and then throughout the entire United States. Mr. Smith was the first one to invent, organize and pioneer the process of Tax Refund Loans in this way and went on to make millions in this business. The financing was originally fully handled by Joel S. Coplon and Company, a small private financing company closely connected with Mr. Smith at the time. Action Accounting and Taxes, the firm that Mr. Smith owned, was one mile from where John Hewitt was just starting a new business venture. Mr. Hewitt had just recently purchased Mel Jackson's Tax Service which was a run down group of offices throughout the Hampton Road's area. Mr. Hewitt began to offer Refund Anticipation Loans in 1988 and built a national franchise out of the idea which funded and built Jackson Hewitt Tax Service. Then in 1989 H & R Block joined in the industry and it became a billion dollar industry across the United States being coopted into thousands of different accounting firms and tax practices across the United States and abroad. It was reported in 1989 that H & R Block had doubled it's business at over 4,000 locations due to the introduction of this new Refund Loan Service. It later spread to Canada as well through Liberty Tax Service and in time this company moved into the United States market as well offering the same service. The proliferation of this tax loan practice coincided with the introduction of electronic filing which IRS introduced electronic filing as a way to decrease its cost of operation. Previous to this time refunds would take on average two to three months to come back from the IRS which is why the Loan on Tax Refund also known as Refund Anticipations Loan business flourished. In 1988, Mr. Smith as well as Mr. Coplon were jointly sued by the Attorney General of Virginia in a Richmond State Court for charging usurious interest. Mr. Smith was eventually dismissed from the case and it was reported by the State's Attorney at the time that the reason for his dismissal from the case was that Mr. Smith was [...] "not culpable".|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} {{support for a}} proposal to eliminate refund fraud in the U. S. by turning Forms W- 2, and 1099 into self-certified/ self-authenticated tax documents. The proposal suggests that a “digital signature” of these documents should be taken after they are completed. The signature should then be made part of the final document. This proposal was initially <b>advanced</b> in <b>Refund</b> Fraud? Real-Time Solution! The underlying premise of that article was that the US could dramatically reduce, if not eliminate, refund fraud if it borrowing digital security techniques from the VAT. The article did not however, explain or expand upon these techniques from within the VATs where they were developed. This article takes up the VAT side of that analysis. VAT frauds frequently manipulate documents for gain, and VAT jurisdictions have spent {{a considerable amount of}} time and energy devising effective and efficient methods for determining if a document is legitimate (or original). The strong suggestion is that the IRS should look to the VAT to solve refund fraud, because even though the tax is different, the administrative problem is the same. The refund fraud problem is essentially document verification problem. The VAT is very good at document verification. The IRS can learn from the VAT. This paper looks at three VAT jurisdictions, Brazil, Quebec and Belgium, and explains how they use technology to solve document authentication problems. In each case a tax fraud is facilitated by false documentation, and the administrative response is to use technology to certify the documents and stop the fraud. In Brazil the fraud arises in the context of internal cross-border B 2 B transactions. In Quebec and Belgium the fraud is skimming profits from B 2 C cash and debit/credit card transactions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a theoretical framework}} of advanced demand through six propositions. The framework introduces the concept of acquisition and valuation risks and suggests that advanced demand distribution {{is rooted in the}} trade off between them. This trade-off also interacts with the firm’s pricing policy in the sense that buyers may decide to buy early or later depending on the firm’s advanced and consumption-time prices. Furthermore, since advanced buyers may not consume, firms may be able to re-sell capacity relinquished. Accordingly, advanced buyers may be preferred due to this characteristic. By extending the framework, the study then analyses the prospects of <b>refunding</b> <b>advanced</b> buyers who {{may not be able to}} consume and proposes four ways through which refunds could provide additional revenue to firms. Through the application of the framework, the study shows that advanced demand may not be as random as researchers traditionally believe and further suggests theoretical reasons why and when service firms are able to practice revenue management. This is because revenue management practice requires the existence of a meaningful selling period in advance, and this could only be so when acquisition risks are high. A critical analysis of revenue management follows, showing that tools such as overbookin...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Americans’ financial capability, {{using data}} from a new survey. Financial capability is {{measured in terms of}} how well people make ends meet, plan ahead, choose and manage financial products, and possess the skills and knowledge to make financial decisions. The findings reported in this work paint a troubling picture of the state of financial capability in the United States. The majority of Americans do not plan for predictable events such as retirement or children’s college education. Most importantly, people do not make provisions for unexpected events and emergencies, leaving themselves and the economy exposed to shocks. To understand financial capability, it is important to look not only at assets but also at debt and debt management, as an increasingly large portion of the population carry debt. In managing debt, Americans engage in behaviors that can generate large expenses, such as sizable interest payments and fees. Moreover, more than one in five Americans has used alternative (and often costly) borrowing methods (payday loans, <b>advances</b> on tax <b>refunds,</b> pawn shops, etc.) in the past five years. The most worrisome finding is that many people do not seem well informed and knowledgeable about their terms of borrowing; a sizeable group does not know the terms of their mortgages or the interest rates they pay on their loans. Finally, the majority of Americans lack basic numeracy and knowledge of fundamental economic principles such as the workings of inflation, risk diversification, and the relationship between asset prices and interest rates. ...|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Taxpayers {{who do not want}} to wait for their tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may choose to obtain refund anticipation loans (RAL). RALs are short-term, high-interest bank loans that are advertised and brokered by both national chain and local tax preparation companies. Although the annual percentage rate (APR) on RALs can be over 500 percent, they allow taxpayers to receive cash refunds quickly [...] sometimes within the same day and even within an hour of filing their tax returns. After filing a taxpayer's return electronically, the tax preparer works in cooperation with a bank to <b>advance</b> the <b>refund</b> as a loan minus tax preparation costs, other fees, and a finance charge. As part of the RAL process, the taxpayer provides authorization to IRS to send the refund directly to the bank to repay the loan. Despite the benefits of receiving cash quickly based on an expected refund, IRS officials and others have raised concerns about whether taxpayers are fully aware of the costs involved and their tax filing alternatives. For example, in a 2007 report to Congress, the IRS National Taxpayer Advocate questioned whether RAL consumers actually understand the nature of the loan product they are receiving. According to the Advocate, while tax preparers offering RALs are required to obtain taxpayers' signatures on written disclosure forms, there are no requirements that such disclosures be made orally. The Advocate wrote that despite the written disclosures provided to them, consumers may not fully understand that the RAL is in fact a loan and not simply a way to receive a faster refund from IRS. Further, without an oral explanation, consumers may lack a general {{understanding of the nature of}} the product and its impact on credit reports, as well as other consequences of default. In January 2008, in order to address this issue, IRS and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) indicated in a Federal Register notice that they were considering rules to prohibit tax preparers from marketing RALs based on information gathered during the tax preparation process. In their notice, IRS and Treasury cite concerns about tax preparers improperly inflating refunds in order to market RALs, particularly when working with customers eligible for the earned income tax credit (EITC). IRS studies have found that this credit is particularly susceptible to fraud, in many cases perpetuated by paid tax preparers. In 1999, an IRS compliance study found $ 10. 4 billion of overclaims on the EITC, of which $ 7. 2 billion (70 percent) was attributed to tax returns completed by paid preparers. Based on continuing concerns over how RALs are marketed to taxpayers, Congress requested that GAO perform a limited investigation to identify examples of where RALs are marketed and the types of information tax preparers disclose to potential RAL applicants. ...|$|R
