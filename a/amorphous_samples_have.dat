The nanoporous nature of crystalline phase has been confirmed also by DSC analysis, which points out that the crystalline domain displays a very low melting temperature. Sorption experiments indicate that semi-crystalline PPO is a promising candidate for use as membrane material in gas separation processes, in view of the remarkably high values of solubility and diffusivity.

The present analysis allows concluding that {{the volume of the}} guest plays {{a crucial role in the}} choice of the type of d-clathrate that can be obtained. As a matter of fact, longer n-alkanes, such as n-octane, n-nonane or n-decane, turned out to give rise triclinic d-clathrates presenting a guest/monomeric-unit ratio of 1 / 8, while d-clathrates containing shorter alkanes, like n-hexane or n-heptane, instead, present a monoclinic or a triclinic structure with a guest/monomeric-unit ratio of 1 / 4. These results confirm the validity of a simple criterion to predict the type of s-PS d-clathrate with a certain guest on the basis of the experimental d 010, as described in Macromolecules 2010, 43, 8549 e 8558.

40|$|Thin {{films of}} hafnium oxide (HfO 2) have been grown by high {{pressure}} reactive sputtering on transparent quartz substrates (UV- grade silica) and silicon wafers. Deposition conditions were adjusted to obtain polycrystalline {{as well as}} amorphous films. Optical properties of the films deposited on the silica substrates were investigated by transmittance and reflectance spectroscopy in the ultraviolet, visible and near infrared range. A numerical analysis method {{that takes into account}} the different surface roughness of the polycrystalline and amorphous films was applied to calculate the optical constants (refractive index and absorption coefficient). Amorphous films were found to have a higher refractive index and a lower transparency than polycrystalline films. This is attributed to a higher density of the <b>amorphous</b> <b>samples,</b> which was confirmed by atomic density measurements performed by heavy- ion elastic recoil detection analysis. The absorption coefficient gave an excellent fit to the Tauc law (indirect gap), which allowed a band gap value of 5. 54 eV to be obtained. The structure of the films (amorphous or polycrystalline) was found to have no significant influence {{on the nature of the}} band gap. The Tauc plots also give information about the structure of the films, because the slope of the plot (the Tauc parameter) is related to the degree of order in the bond network. The <b>amorphous</b> <b>samples</b> <b>had</b> a larger value of the Tauc parameter, i. e. more order than the polycrystalline samples.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the mechanical properties and elastic behavior of low-stereoregular and nearly amorphous syndiotactic polypropylene (sam-PP), prepared with heterocycle-fused indenyl silyl amido dimethyltitanium complexes, is presented. High-molecular-weight poorly syndiotactic sam-PP samples show good elastic behavior at room temperature in a large range of deformation. While highly stereoregular and crystalline syndiotactic polypropylene shows good elastic properties only for previously stretched oriented fibers, sam-PP samples present good elasticity even for unoriented compression-molded films during the first stretching. Because of the very low crystallinity, these samples experience a negligible irreversible plastic deformation and show a typical behavior of thermoplastic elastomers. The small crystalline domains in the amorphous matrix act as physical knots of the elastomeric lattice, preventing the viscous flow of the amorphous chains. The elastic behavior {{is associated with a}} reversible polymorphic transition between the trans-planar mesomorphic form and helical form I, which occurs in the crystalline domains during successive stretching and relaxing of fiber specimens, giving an enthalpic contribution which assists the elastic recovery of the samples. The entropic effect of the conformational transition of the amorphous chains, connecting the crystalline domains as tie chains, is, however, mainly responsible for the elasticity. The comparison with the mechanical properties of high-molecular-weight <b>amorphous</b> polypropylene <b>samples</b> <b>has</b> shown that the latter present lower strength and experience rapid viscous flow of the chains at high deformations and/or by application of stresses for long time.

On the <b>amorphous</b> <b>sample</b> (Figure 3 b), the central area (which was previously pre-stressed, Figure 3 a) shows smaller currents {{than the rest of}} the scanned region.

The quantitative values of the background current on the three concentric areas are shown in the table of Figure 3. In the <b>amorphous</b> <b>sample,</b> the background current decreases significantly as the stress proceeds, making the structure less conductive. This behavior, as already pointed out for SiO 2 layers [29] or high-k dielectrics, can be related to negative charge trapping in the native defects or in traps generated during the stress.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the OD stretching band as a probe to detect HDO in astrophysical ice is discussed based on IR laboratory spectra of HDO molecules embedded in H 2 O ice. This band is extremely broad and tends to disappear into the absorption continuum of H 2 O for low-temperature <b>amorphous</b> <b>samples.</b> Detectable HDO/H 2 O ratios with this technique may range from a few percent for <b>amorphous</b> <b>samples</b> to a few per thousand in crystalline ice. These relatively high upper limits and the appreciable dependence of the band shape on temperature, which would complicate the interpretation of data from many lines of sight, decisively limit {{the usefulness of the}} technique for HDO detection in astronomical observations. The process of isotopic H/D exchange in mixed ice of H 2 O/D 2 O is also studied through the evolution of the OD band in IR spectra. Isotopic exchange starts at ∼ 120 K and is greatly accelerated at 150 K, as crystallization proceeds in the ice. Annealed <b>amorphous</b> <b>samples</b> prove to be more favorable for isotope exchange than samples directly formed in crystalline phase. The annealing process seems to favor a polycrystalline ice morphology with a higher defect activity. These morphology differences can be of relevance for deuterium fractionation in astronomical environments...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} and physical stability of amorphous sulfathiazole obtained from polymorphic forms I and III by cryomilling was investigated by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. Principal component analysis {{was applied to}} the NIR data to monitor the generation of crystalline disorder with milling time and to study subsequent recrystallization under different storage conditions. Complete conversion into the amorphous phase was observed for both forms after 45 (form I) and 150 min (form III) milling time. Upon storage under vacuum over silica gel for 14 days at 4 degrees C, <b>amorphous</b> <b>samples</b> remained <b>amorphous.</b> However, under the same conditions at ambient temperature, recrystallization occurred. <b>Amorphous</b> <b>samples</b> obtained from form I had crystallized back to the original polymorph, whereas those prepared from form III had partially crystallized to mixtures of polymorphs. <b>Amorphous</b> <b>samples</b> stored at ambient temperature and humidity absorbed moisture, which facilitated crystallization to a mixture of polymorphs in both cases. Quantitative analyses of amorphous content in binary mixtures with forms I and III were carried out by XRPD and NIR spectroscopy combined with partial least squares regression. The calibration models had root mean square error of prediction values ofThis paper is based upon works supported by the Science Foundation Ireland under Grant No. [07 /SRC/B 1158] as part of the Solid State Pharmaceutical Cluster (SSPC) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} study of the {{ferromagnetic}} behaviour of crystalline and <b>amorphous</b> <b>samples</b> with identical composition Fe 2 Zr. The crystalline sample was obtained by arc melting. The two <b>amorphous</b> <b>samples</b> were obtained by mechanical grinding from the intermetallic crystalline phase and by mechanical alloying starting from the elements, respectively. We investigated the magnetic properties of the alloy using Mössbauer spectroscopy and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry. The values of the Mössbauer parameters are reported and discussed. We present the initial magnetization curves and hysteresis loops. The magnetization behaviour is marked by saturation at low field values with very small values of remanent magnetization and coercive field, indicating that the samples are soft ferromagnets; this feature is more sharpened in the crystal. The mechanically grinded sample is more similar to the crystalline compound than the mechanically alloyed sample. ...|$|R
