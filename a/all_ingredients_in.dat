40|$|The recent {{experimental}} {{realization of}} 1 D equal Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling (ERD-SOC) for cold atoms provide a disorder-free {{platform for the}} implementation and observation of Majorana fermions (MFs), similar to the well studied solid state nanowire/superconductor heterostructures. However, the corresponding 1 D chains of cold atoms possess strong quantum fluctuation, which may destroy the superfluids and MFs.

40|$|Two {{trials were}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of irradiation of individual ingredients or the whole diet on growth performance in nursery pigs. The response was similar for both trials with pigs fed diets containing irradiated spray-dried animal plasma or soybean meal having increased (P< 0. 05) ADG compared with pigs fed the control diet with no irradiated ingredients or the complete diet that was irradiated. Also, ADFI (P< 0. 05) was higher for pigs consuming the diet with irradiated soybean meal compared with those fed the irradiated whole diet. Pigs fed irradiated spray-dried animal plasma also had superior F/G (P< 0. 05) compared with those fed diets containing irradiated microingredients or if all ingredients had been irradiated before manufacturing. Therefore, irradiation of certain feed ingredients can improve growth performance in nursery, whereas irradiation of <b>all</b> <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> the diet or the whole diet does not enhance performance...|$|E

40|$|Our {{work was}} {{to study the}} preparation, {{physicochemical}} characterization, and in vitro characteristic of Zingiber cassumunar blended patches. The Z. cassumunar blended patches incorporating Z. cassumunar Roxb. also known as Plai were prepared from chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol with glycerin as plasticizer. They were prepared by adding <b>all</b> <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> a beaker and homogeneously mixing them. Then, they were transferred into Petri-dish and dried in hot air oven. The hydrophilic nature of the Z. cassumunar blended patches was confirmed by the moisture uptake, swelling ratio, erosion, and porosity values. The FTIR, DSC, XRD, and SEM studies showed revealed blended patches with amorphous region that was homogeneously smooth and compact in both surface and cross section dimensions. They exhibited controlled the release behavior of (E) - 4 -(3 ′, 4 ′-dimethoxyphenyl) but- 3 -en-l-ol (compound D) that is the main active compound in Z. cassumunar for anti-inflammation activity. However, in in vitro skin permeation study, the compound D was accumulated in newborn pig skin {{more than in the}} receptor medium. Thus, the blended patches showed the suitable entrapment and controlled release of compound D. Accordingly, we have demonstrated that such chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol formulated patches might be developed for medical use...|$|E
40|$|During {{traditional}} {{industrial processing}} {{of fruit and}} vegetable derived foods, consideration of the eventual retention, bio-accessibility or bio-availability of nutrients has hitherto been a secondary priority. Indeed standard processing of soups and sauces involves treating <b>all</b> <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> a similar way, usually by prolonged heat treatment and results in both lowered nutritional value and sensory quality of food products. Such products are typically structured using various additives including starches, gums and stabilizers, which consumers regard as unnatural, rather than exploiting the endogenous structuring potential of the fruit and vegetable ingredients as available at the farm gate. Recent studies undertaken within the EU sponsored 2 ̆ 7 Healthy Structuring 2 ̆ 7 project have shown how to design an industrially manufactured product with good sensory qualities that is natural and nutritious. The strategy has been to use the inherent structural and nutritional properties of the raw material ingredients, {{on the one hand}} to ensure the textural quality of the final product without the use of artificial gums or stabilizers and, on the other hand to optimize the nutritional quality of the final product. This review briefly summarizes both the approach taken and the results obtained within the project...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. According to the Uniformization Theorem any surface can be {{conformal}}ly mapped into a flat domain, that is, {{a domain}} with zero Gaussian curvature. The conformal factor indicates the local scaling introduced {{by such a}} mapping. This process {{could be used to}} compute geometric quantities in a simplified flat domain. For example, the computation of geodesic distances on a curved surface can be mapped into solving an eikonal equation in a plane weighted by the conformal factor. Solving an eikonal equation on the weighted plane can then be done with regular sampling of the domain using, for example, the fast marching method. The connection between the conformal factor on the plane and the surface geometry can be justified analytically. Still, in order to construct consistent numerical solvers that exploit this relation one needs to prove that the conformal factor is bounded. In this paper we provide theoretical bounds over the conformal factor and introduce optimization formulations that control its behavior. It is demonstrated that without such a control the numerical results are unboundedly inaccurate. Putting <b>all</b> <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> the right order, we introduce a method for computing geodesic distances on a two dimensional manifold by using the fast marching algorithm on a weighed flat domain. ...|$|E
