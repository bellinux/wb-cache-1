25|$|Unlike Clapton, Ginger Baker {{had enjoyed}} his Blind Faith {{experience}} {{and looked to}} carry on {{an offshoot of the}} band in the form of Ginger Baker's Air Force with both Grech and Winwood. After a few shows together, Winwood left with Grech and went to Island Records to reunite and reform Traffic (Grech is featured on bass on the Traffic albums The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys <b>and</b> <b>Welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Canteen). Winwood would later go on to have a successful solo career and Grech was a member of various groups before his death in 1990 due to a brain hemorrhage.|$|E
500|$|Marcia Mitzman Gaven (born February 28, 1959) is {{an award-winning}} American actress from New York. Since {{studying}} at the High School of Performing Arts and the State University of New York at Purchase, she {{has appeared in}} many musicals during her career singing in both mezzo-soprano and soprano roles. Her Broadway debut came in 1979 when she played Betty Rizzo in Grease, serving as the replacement for the original actress of the role. In the 1980s she appeared in the musicals The Rocky Horror Show, [...] Oliver!, Zorba, Nine, Anything Goes, Chess, <b>and</b> <b>Welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Club, and in the operas Brigadoon, South Pacific, and [...]|$|E

500|$|Also in 1988, Gaven {{played the}} part of the Russian chess player's wife Svetlana in the {{short-lived}} Broadway production of the musical Chess, for which she was praised by critics. The following year she appeared as Carol Bates in the Broadway musical Welcome to the Club. It revolves around four men who have been put in jail for not paying alimony. The musical shows why they ended up divorcing their wives, one of which is played by Gaven. Both Chess <b>and</b> <b>Welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Club were unsuccessful. John Simon criticized the latter musical in a New York Magazine review but praised Gaven's performance, writing: [...] "The cast ranges from the charmless to the hopeless [...] in this mess. Only Marcia Mitzman manages to stand out from the crowd, and when she gets the right part in the right show, she'll do just fine." [...] Associated Press drama critic Michael Kuchwara also wrote negatively about Welcome to the Club while giving praise to Gaven for projecting [...] "a sympathy [...] that isn't apparent in the book." ...|$|E
2500|$|After leaving, Smith {{started a}} family with his Canadian wife, Nathalie, and would not play guitar again until he joined Iron Maiden onstage at Donington Park in 1992 to perform [...] "Running Free". In the same year, after hearing King's X for the first time, {{he decided that he}} would [...] "love to play in a band like that" [...] and formed The Untouchables, which later became Psycho Motel. The band {{recorded}} two albums, State of Mind in 1996 <b>and</b> <b>Welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> World in 1997, during which they supported Iron Maiden on the British leg of The X Factour. The project was put on hold, however, when Smith joined Bruce Dickinson for his 1997 album, Accident of Birth, after which he became a full-time member of Dickinson's solo outfit, embarking on two world tours and contributing to one further studio release, 1998's The Chemical Wedding.|$|E

60|$|At nightfall {{he had not}} returned. The woman {{prepared}} {{supper and}} waited. Then she put Baby to bed and sang softly to her until she slept. By this time the fire on the hearth, at which she had cooked supper, had burned out {{and the room was}} lighted by a single candle. This she afterward placed in the open window as a sign <b>and</b> <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hunter if he should approach from that side. She had thoughtfully closed and barred the door against such wild animals as might prefer it to an open window --of the habits of beasts of prey in entering a house uninvited she was not advised, though with true female prevision she may have considered the possibility of their entrance by way of the chimney. As the night wore on she became not less anxious, but more drowsy, and at last rested her arms upon the bed by the child and her head upon the arms. The candle in the window burned down to the socket, sputtered and flared a moment and went out unobserved; for the woman slept and dreamed.|$|E
6000|$|Elated {{with the}} idea of seeing life, Pen went into a hundred queer London haunts. He liked to think he was consorting with all sorts of men--so he beheld coalheavers in their tap-rooms; boxers in their inn-parlours; honest {{citizens}} disporting in the suburbs or on the river; and {{he would have liked to}} hob and nob with celebrated pickpockets, or drink a pot of ale with a company of burglars and cracksmen, had chance afforded him an opportunity of making the acquaintance of this class of society. It was good to see the gravity with which Warrington listened to the Tutbury Pet or the Brighton Stunner at the Champion's Arms, and behold the interest which he took in the coalheaving company assembled at the Fox-under-the-Hill. His acquaintance with the public-houses of the metropolis and its neighbourhood, and with the frequenters of their various parlours, was prodigious. He was the personal friend of the landlord and landlady, <b>and</b> <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bar as to the clubroom. He liked their society, he said, better than that of his own class, whose manners annoyed him, and whose conversation bored him. [...] "In society," [...] he used to say, [...] "everybody is the same, wears the same dress, eats and drinks, and says the same things; one young dandy at the club talks and looks just like another, one Miss at a ball exactly resembles another, whereas there's character here. I like to talk with the strongest man in England, or the man who can drink the most beer in England, or with that tremendous republican of a hatter, who thinks Thistlewood was the greatest character in history. I like better gin-and-water than claret. I like a sanded floor in Carnaby Market better than a chalked one in Mayfair. I prefer Snobs, I own it." [...] Indeed, this gentleman was a social republican; and it never entered his head while conversing with Jack and Tom that he was in any respect their better; although, perhaps, the deference which they paid him might secretly please him.|$|E
60|$|Never {{was fair}} weather after foul-nor warm weather after cold-nor a sweet and {{beautiful}} spring after a heavy, and nipping, and terrible winter, so comfortable, sweet, desirable, <b>and</b> <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> poor birds and beasts of the field, as this {{day will be}} to the church of God. Darkness! it was the plague of Egypt: it is an empty, forlorn, desolate, solitary, and discomforting state; wherefore light, even the illuminating grace of God, especially in the measure that it shall be communicated unto us at this day, it must needs be precious. In light there is warmth and pleasure; it is {{by the light of}} the sun that the whole universe appears unto us distinctly, and it is by the heat thereof that everything groweth and flourisheth; all which will now be gloriously and spiritually answered in this holy and new Jerusalem (2 Thess 2). O how clearly will all the spiders, and dragons, and owls, and foul spirits of Antichrist at that day be discovered by the light hereof! (Rev 18:1-4). Now also will all the pretty robins and little birds in the Lord's field most sweetly send forth their pleasant notes, and all the flowers and herbs of his garden spring. Then will it be said to the church by her Husband and Saviour, 'Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away; for lo, the winter is past the rain is over and gone, the flowers appear on the earth, the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; the fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell' (Cant 2:10-13). You know how pleasant this is, even to be fulfilled in the letter of it, not only to birds and beasts, but men; especially it is pleasant to such men that have for several years been held in the chains of affliction. It must needs, therefore, be most pleasant and desirable to the afflicted church of Christ, who hath lain now in the dungeon of Antichrist for above a thousand years. But, Lord, how will this lady, when she gets her liberty, and when she is returned to her own city, how will she then take pleasure in the warm and spangling beams of thy shining grace! and solace herself with thee in the garden, among the nuts and the pomegranates, among the lilies and flowers, and all the chief spices (Cant 7:11-13).|$|E
