Based on the field {{measured}} data, the reason of bolt pre-stressed hysteresis descending in soft coal roadway was analyzed in detail by theoretical analysis and field measurement. Closely encircling the changing law of <b>anchorage</b> <b>force</b> during the bolt bearing course, the reason of the low initial <b>anchorage</b> <b>force</b> in soft coal roadway, the effect of surrounding rock deformation on bolt <b>anchorage</b> <b>force</b> and the circulating hysteresis descending of <b>anchorage</b> <b>force</b> as well as the impact of the structure stability on bearing structure of the bolt-mesh support were analyzed. The analyzed results show there exists a great amount of bolt pre-stress hysteresis descending in soft coal roadway because of remarkable difference between bolt and soft coal deformable capability. Thus, many comprehensive measures should be taken to effectively control the initial loose deformation of non-anchorage rocks between two bolts, to achieve higher initial <b>anchorage</b> <b>force</b> and to prevent <b>anchorage</b> <b>force</b> losing during bolt bearing course. At the same time along with increasing the bolting strength, the structure compensating measures should be taken to ensure the structure stability of the bolt-mesh support and to realize the high-strength stable bolting...|$|E

40|$|Reliable {{mechanical}} {{weed control}} requires knowledge of the achievable levels of weed control and crop damage when using certain implements in specific conditions. Quantitative methods that use weed, crop, soil, and cultivator characteristics to predict weed control and crop damage need to be developed. To that end, the relative susceptibility of weeds and crop plants to mechanical weeding and the selective ability of cultivators need to be quantified separately. The method presented in this study uses measured plant anchorage forces to quantify crop and weed sensitivity to being uprooted by a weed harrow and predicts the relationship between weed and crop uprooting by mechanical weeding. Uprooting and <b>anchorage</b> <b>force</b> of young perennial ryegrass and garden cress plants were measured in laboratory harrowing experiments on sandy soil. A nonlinear equation was introduced to describe the relationship between weed uprooting and crop uprooting. The parameters representing the selective potential of the actual crop-weed condition (K-pot) and the imlement selective ability (K-cult) did not depend on crop uprooting. The relationship between potential weed and crop uprooting that could theoretically be obtained by a perfectly selective implement (i. e., pulling each plant with equal force) was calculated from plant <b>anchorage</b> <b>force</b> distributions measured before harrowing. The observed uprooting percentages achieved by harrowing were lower than the potential uprooting percentages. With K-cult accounting for imperfect weeder selective ability, prediction accuracy was satisfactory. Field validation is required to confirm whether this method improves comparison and prediction of weeding performance of different weeding implements in different crop-weed situations...|$|E

The current seismic design approach is based on the equivalent lateral force (ELF) method whose underlying assumptions significantly differ from the actual dynamic response of these buildings. The seismic behavior of rigid wall-flexible rood diaphragm (RWFD) Buildings is dominated by the diaphragm 2 ̆ 7 s response instead of the wall 2 ̆ 7 in-plane response. Furthermore, the diaphragm 2 ̆ 7 s ductility and overstrength capacity is unique to its own construction.

The criterion of structure stability is developed based on plastic complementary energy and its variation. It is presented that the principle of minimum plastic complementary energy is the combination of structure equilibrium, coordination condition of deformation and constitutive relationship.

The structure global stability can be described by the relationship between the global degree of safety of structure and the plastic complementary energy. Correspondingly, the new idea is used in the evaluations of global stability, <b>anchorage</b> <b>force</b> of dam-toe, fracture of dam-heel and treatment of faults of high arch dams in China.

40|$|The seismic {{behavior}} of large low-rise buildings with rigid walls and flexible diaphragms will be dominated {{more by the}} diaphragm’s seismic response than by the very stiff vertical walls. For practitioners, estimating the stiffness of large flexible diaphragms is important for computing building setbacks from property lines and adjacent structures as well as evaluating structural integrity under seismic loads. In addition, researchers attempting to accurately model a building’s dynamic behavior need to assemble an accurate diaphragm stiffness prediction. The traditional diaphragm chord model consists of a single continuous line of axial resistance at the diaphragm boundaries; however, as this paper will demonstrate a collective series of structural members distributed across the diaphragm will function intentionally or unintentionally as a collective chord, adding significant flexural stiffness and reducing chord forces. In seismically active areas, masonry and concrete wall <b>anchorage</b> <b>forces</b> utilize code-mandated continuous cross-ties within the diaphragm, and often these cross-ties are sufficiently strong and stiff to unintentionally develop collective chord behavior whether in steel or in wood diaphragm systems. While neglecting this embedded collective chord behavior results in conservative chord and diaphragm drift designs, researchers or practitioners trying to predict seismic response of these buildings will potentially underestimate the true seismic response...|$|R
40|$|The {{ultimate}} strength of R/C beams retrofitted in flexure and shear {{by means of}} externally bonded fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) has {{attracted the attention of}} many researchers due to the particularities highlighted by a wide set of experimental results.

30|$|However, no firm {{evidence}} {{exists in the}} literature regarding the optimal force levels for maxillary dentoalveolar intrusion. The proponents of extra-oral traction, {{in the form of}} headgear, advocate relatively high-force magnitudes ranging anywhere from 300 to 1, 500 g of force. Most however use forces in the range of 400 to 600 g. In terms of traditional intra-oral tooth borne mechanics, Burstone [20] suggested 20 g of intrusive force for incisors and 50 g for canines, whilst Proffit [21] advocates 10 to 20 g of continuous intrusive force. Kalra et al. [22] applied 90 g of force to intrude molars in children compared to Melson and Fiorelli [23] who suggested 50 g of force for molar intrusion in adults. With the advent of skeletal <b>anchorage,</b> <b>force</b> systems could be altered and increased without concern for unwanted side effects in the reactive unit and B chter [24] found miniscrews to remain clinically stable at force levels up to 900 g. Using skeletal anchorage, the suggested intrusive force level for single maxillary molars, from literature, appears to be 100 to 200 g [25]. Kato and Kato however found 100 g of force to be insufficient for en masse molar intrusion, but smooth progressive intrusion was achieved when the force levels where increased to 300 g per side [26].

The steel-belt has {{the ability}} to improve support effect of the whole system that {{coordinate}} the <b>anchorage</b> <b>force</b> of bolt or cable, improve the support effect of the anchor system and diffuse the fore acted on bolt or cable. During the progress of support in the roadway, there has appeared flat, W and M steel-belt, and all of them have played important roles in different stages of support in the roadway. However, steel-belt now is rarely used in the deep rock roadway. High convex steel-belt is a new product, but whether it can adapt or not to the deep roadway, it's well worth our attention. The structure of high convex steel-belt and the characteristics of deep roadway are introduced in this paper. Numerical test on four kinds of mine steel-belt is carried out by ANSYS, and the advantage of high convex steel-belt is comparatively analyzed in deep roadway. At last, an example is shown. Research indicates that the steel-belt bears mainly the point load or local load due to non smooth and even convex wall sides, and it lies in a state of inelastic and large deformation due to non uniformity deformation of surrounding rock in the deep rock roadway. The mechanical behavior of convex steel-belt has the performance of obvious advantages. It can adapt to the large deformation of deep roadway due to the convex structure.

The phenomenon of progressive collapse can be likened to the failure of a house of cards where structural damage propagates beyond the locality of the initial damage and to an extent disproportional to the original cause. Insufficient consideration of the structure’s potential for progressive collapse has widely been seen as responsible for some of the most high profile structural collapses of the last 60 years. The need to rigorously consider and mitigate for the risk of such collapse occurring is often seen to be more imperative within the design and detailing of pre-cast concrete structures, which is mainly due to their segmental nature of and associated inherent lack of structural continuity. Aimed at highlighting the need for a more quantitative design methodology, the paper evaluates the suitability of commonly advocated measures for ensuring structural robustness in pre-cast building typologies. Using a non-linear ‘push-down’ simulation the suitability of existing tying and <b>anchorage</b> <b>force</b> provisions are evaluated, with such prescriptive detailing rules often adopted by design engineers to justify a suitable level of structural robustness. This computational assessment enabled a quantitative assessment of the performance of pre-cast framed buildings subjected to a sudden column loss event. The findings highlight a need for current design and detailing practice to take more appropriate account of the nonlinear response of components and joints incorporated within multi-storey buildings...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{promising}} clinical {{results for the}} use of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) in musculoskeletal defect treatment, inadequate control of cell survival, engraftment and fate limits the success of this cell-based therapy. Integrin-mediated cell adhesion plays a central role in tissue formation, maintenance, and repair by providing <b>anchorage</b> <b>forces</b> and triggering signals that regulate cell function. We hypothesize that biomaterials presenting integrin-specific adhesive motifs will direct hMSC engraftment and function to improve bone repair. The objective of this project is to engineer bioartificial hydrogels presenting integrin-specific ligands as biomimetic cell delivery vehicles for enhanced in vivo engraftment and function – an innovative strategy as it focuses on engineering specificity to integrin receptors to promote survival and cell-based repair without the use of exogenous growth factors. We investigated the performance of a cell-mediated degradable hydrogel functionalized with integrin-specific ligands in supporting the survival of transplanted hMSC and tissue repair in a segmental bone defect. This was accomplished by incorporating the adhesive  2  1 integrin-specific GFOGER ligand, adhesive v 3 integrin-specific RGD ligand, non-adhesive RDG peptide, or non-adhesive GAOGER peptide combined with human mesenchymal stem cells in a protease-degradable PEG-maleimide hydrogel. Cell survival was tracked through transgenic luciferase expression and bone repair was monitored by microcomputer tomography. We hypothesized that hydrogel delivery vehicles that promoted cell viability in combination with the pro-osteogenic properties of the carrier would result in superior bone repair. We found that α 2 β 1 -specific GFOGER-functionalized hydrogels promoted enhanced hMSC survival and bone repair, with differential expression of vascularization and inflammation-related genes in vivo compared to RGD- or RDG-functionalized hydrogels, highlighting integrin-specificity as an important consideration in the design of cell delivery vehicles for engraftment and tissue repair. We have generated new insights into transplanted hMSC survival, engraftment and function in a bone repair model allowing for direct correlations among hydrogel formulation and integrin specificity, transplanted cell survival, and bone repair outcomes. This work is significant and innovative because improved design of cell delivery vehicles may improve efficacy of current hMSC therapies in the clinic. Ph. D...|$|R

40|$|The current design {{practice}} of precast buildings {{is based on}} a frame mode, where the peripheral cladding panelsenter only as masses without anystiffness. The panels are then connected to the structure with fastenings dimensioned with a local calculation {{on the basis of their}} mass for <b>anchorage</b> <b>forces</b> orthogonal to the plane of the panels. This design approach does not work, as it was recently dramatically shown by several recent violent shakes, like L’Aquila (Italy) in 2009, Grenada (Spain) in 2010, and Emilia (Italy) in 2012. The panels, fixed in this way to the structure, come to be integral part of the resisting system, conditioning its seismic response. The high stiffness of this resisting system leads to forces much higher than those calculated from the frame model. These forces are related to the global mass of the floors and are primarily directed in the plane of the walls. Furthermore, the seismic force reduction in the type of precast structures of concern relies on energy dissipation in plastic hinges formed in the columns. Very large drifts of the columns are needed to activate this energy dissipation foreseen in design. However, typically, the capacity of the connections between cladding and structure is exhausted well before such large drifts can develop. Therefore, the design of these connections cannot rely on the seismic reduction factor used for design of the bare structure. New technological solutions for connectors with proper design approaches were urgently required. The research project SAFECLADDING was thus aimed at investigating, by means of a balanced combination of experimental and analytical activity, the seismic behaviour of precast structures with cladding wall panels and at developing innovative connection devices and novel design approaches for a correct conception and dimensioning of the fastening system to guarantee good seismic performance of the structure throughout its service life. The final outcome of the SAFECLADDING project is represented by a set of documents providing the design guidelines produced by the consortium. The guidelines have a theoretical derivation supported by the experimental results of the testing campaigns and numerical simulations performed within the project. General know-how on production practice and international literature on the subject have been also considered.

Citrus and two Liberty ships, SS George Flavel and SS McKenzie, transported Coast Guard construction crews to erect Quonset huts for Construction Detachment [...] "A" [...] at Massacre Bay, Attu and at Baxter Cove, Adak. Unloading at Adak was done with 5' x 7' steel pontoon-type barges. They arrived on 24 December 1943. Heavy ground swells made unloading materiel from the cutter to the barge precarious. Despite the possibility of a sudden squall, both barges made the beach about sundown. Temporary floodlights were then rigged and unloading operations continued until 1200 on Christmas Day. As the storm increased in intensity, Citrus was unable to maintain her <b>anchorage</b> and was <b>forced</b> to return to Massacre Bay until the storm subsided on 2 January 1944.|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the force}} {{analysis}} and mechanical transmission mechanism of grouting bolts, the self-developed test apparatus for interfacial mechanics is used to study the distribution rule of axial force and interfacial stress of bolts in anchorage body. At the same time, pull-out tests of anchorage body are simulated with the particle flow code software PFC 2 D, and stress distribution and failure patters are researched under different loading rates. The {{results show that the}} distribution of axial force and interfacial shear stress is nonuniform along the <b>anchorage</b> section: axial <b>force</b> decreases, shear force increases first and then decreases, and the maximum value of both of them is closed to the pull-out side; with the increase of loading rates, both of axial force and interfacial shear stress show a trend of increase in the upper anchorage section but changes are not obvious in the lower anchorage section, which causes serious stress concentration; failure strength of pull-out and loading rates show a linear correlation; according to loading rates’ impact on the anchoring effect, the loading rates’ scope can be divided into soft scope (v 100 [*]mm/s) ...|$|R
