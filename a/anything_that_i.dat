5|$|The {{order and}} {{regularity}} that prevailed on board, {{from the moment}} the ship struck till she totally disappeared, far exceeded <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had thought could be effected by the best discipline; and it is the more to be wondered at seeing that most of the soldiers were but a short time in the service. Everyone did as he was directed and there was not a murmur or cry amongst them until the ship made her final plunge – all received their orders and carried them out as if they were embarking instead of going to the bottom – I never saw any embarkation conducted with so little noise or confusion.|$|E

[...] Just to hear Zadok the Priest, I think, has lifted me to Cloud Nine, because it's something that I love. [...] And to hear that and to have the Queen pass so close to me.

500|$|After Khia {{was given}} a diminished role in the music video, {{she went to her}} MySpace account to say she was not pleased with her scenes being {{displayed}} in a TV during the music video, and criticized Jackson. Despite that, Khia said years later that the situation was calmed down, and wrote a song with Jackson in mind. However, she did not regret the feedback she gave the singer, stating, [...] "I don't say <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't mean. I meant every word that I said. People mix the truth with hate, but no I didn't appreciate her putting me on the television. A lot of people blew that out of proportion like, 'Oh my god, Khia's hating on Janet,' but she called me and we were okay. It's just me voicing the situation to my fans".|$|E
500|$|When Cher was {{in fifth}} grade, she {{produced}} {{a performance of}} the musical Oklahoma! for her teacher and class. She organized a group of girls, directing and choreographing their dance routines. Unable to convince boys to participate, she acted the male roles and sang their songs. By age nine, she had developed an unusually low voice. Fascinated by film stars, Cher's role model was Audrey Hepburn, particularly due to {{her role in the}} 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's. Cher began to take after the unconventional outfits and behavior of Hepburn's character. She was disappointed by the absence of dark-haired Hollywood actresses whom she could emulate then. She had wanted to be famous since childhood but felt unattractive and untalented, later commenting, [...] "I couldn't think of <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could do... I didn't think I'd be a singer or dancer. I just thought, well, I'll be famous. That was my goal." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 60 Minutes {{interview}} on March 31, 2005, Fonda reiterated {{that she had}} no regrets about her trip to North Vietnam in 1972, {{with the exception of the}} anti-aircraft-gun photo. She stated that the incident was a [...] "betrayal" [...] of American forces and of the [...] "country that gave me privilege". Fonda said, [...] "The image of Jane Fonda, Barbarella, Henry Fonda's daughter ... sitting on an enemy aircraft gun was a betrayal ... the largest lapse of judgment that I can even imagine." [...] She later distinguished between regret over the use of her image as propaganda and pride for her anti-war activism: [...] "There are hundreds of American delegations that had met with the POWs. Both sides were using the POWs for propaganda ... It's not something that I will apologize for." [...] Fonda said she had no regrets about the broadcasts she made on Radio Hanoi, something she asked the North Vietnamese to do: [...] "Our government was lying to us and men were dying because of it, and I felt I had to do <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could to expose the lies and help end the war." ...|$|E

[...] "They've lost any sensibility that they had, and they've allowed all the kooks in. So I'm going independent." [...] He also told CMT that he would likely vote for the Republican ticket, partially because of his admiration for Sarah Palin.|$|E

2500|$|This led to {{increased}} {{pressures on the}} two creators (and the team which they formed to help them), including a prolonged period (about a year) of artist's block in Laird. The [...] "incredible growth {{and complexity of the}} business" [...] that sprang up around their instantly-successful Turtles properties, led to Laird: [...] "suddenly discover to my horror that I no longer enjoyed drawing. It was a real shock, because if I ever had <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could rely on... it was that I loved to draw." ...|$|E

2500|$|After touring {{for nearly}} two years, the Wallflowers took a short break before {{returning}} to the studio to record their third album, (Breach). [...] Dylan approached the songwriting process differently this time than he had for the Wallflowers' two previous albums, explaining that he didn't want to avoid the subject of his personal life, as he had done in the past: [...] "(Breach) was the first record that I realized that it's necessary and I have a right to write about <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want to write about. [...] I'm not going to dance around these subjects anymore [...] [...] [...] I don't have any interest in writing songs that are defensive or that address anything that don't come naturally to me but I also realized that I needed to stop this nonsense of pretending that hiding any of this information counts to anybody; it just doesn't really matter anymore." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{for many}} years Mona had made it a {{practice}} to enroll in occasional college-level courses, {{it was in the}} mid 1960s that she completed both a bachelor’s and a master's degree from Queens College. [...] She then taught remedial reading at two Queens elementary schools for eight years. [...] As she recalled, “Every time I would feel mentally stagnant, I would just go take a course at Hunter or [...] [...] [...] any school downtown. And I loved anthropology, I took a lot of courses in that; I loved psychology and I took a lot of courses in that; <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt like that I wanted to do. So it was not until later years that one of the teachers at Queens College talked me into matriculating. And I’m glad he did because when I did graduate, I graduated magna cum laude.” ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Master of Stillness" [...] {{records the}} {{creation}} of [...] "Labyrinth" [...] (2011), Smart's final work before retiring aged 91. Critic John McDonald calls it [...] "a farewell picture – a last definitive statement that rules a line under a long and distinguished career". Curator, author and critic Barry Pearce, interviewed in the film, says of [...] "Labyrinth": [...] "It {{is a kind of}} arrival at the painting he was always chasing, never satisfied, hoping the next one on the easel would be the elusive masterpiece, the one that said it all." [...] Hunter visited Smart at his farmhouse in Tuscany and the painter took her to some of the places near Arezzo that have long inspired him – the concrete streetscapes and urban wastelands that define his vision. [...] "If a good painting comes off, it has a stillness, it has a perfection, and that's as great as <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think a musician or a poet can do", said Smart.|$|E
2500|$|Many of Irwin's stories {{revolve around}} his fictional aunt, Dr. Marguerite Van Camp, whom he {{describes}} as being about 85 years old. Aunt Marguerite founded Southern White Old Lady Hospital in rural Georgia because (as Irwin explains in Marguerite's old lady voice) [...] "all our husbands have moved on, and we were tired of the garden club and the bridge club and the ladies club. So Mary Frances and Julia and I all went back to medical school." [...] Irwin loosely based the character of Marguerite on his mother ("unabashed and delightfully inappropriate") and his maternal grandmother ("a genteel, bun-haired lady of means"). [...] As Irwin explains, [...] "I was raised by Southern women so I imitate a lot of them. Marguerite {{is the voice of}} my grandmother, who was born in 1894, and the attitude of my mother. And <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want to gripe about I put into [...] voice and nobody feels bad about me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hutton {{responded to}} these criticisms in a 2010 paper {{entitled}} [...] "Writing the History of Witchcraft: A Personal View", published in [...] Hutton {{was critical of}} Whitmore's work, characterising it {{as an attempt to}} [...] "destroy my reputation as an authority upon the history of Paganism and witchcraft, at least among Pagans, and especially belief in the arguments of Triumph." [...] Noting that Whitmore [...] "makes no attempt to construct an alternate history" [...] to that presented in Triumph, Hutton accuses Whitmore of carrying out [...] "very little research" [...] into primary source material, instead basing his arguments on [...] "secondary texts of varying quality". Contesting some of Whitmore's claims, Hutton then criticises Whitmore's final chapter, which he calls a [...] "meanspirited" [...] collection of [...] "every criticism that {{he has been able to}} find of <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have written." [...] He went on to challenge Whitmore on this, asking why his work in Triumph of the Moon had not been criticised by [...] "leading figures of British and American Paganism" [...] and by [...] "professional historians, archaeologists, anthropologists, classicists, and literary experts" [...] if it had been as flawed as Whitmore claims.|$|E
2500|$|Joubert {{moved to}} Moseley, Birmingham, in 1962 {{to take up}} a Senior Lectureship at the University of Birmingham; he was later made Reader in Music. In 1979 he was a visiting {{professor}} at the University of Otago in New Zealand. The number and scope of his works increased, and among those composed during the following decades were two further full-length operas, Under Western Eyes (Op. 51, 1968) and Jane Eyre (Op. 134) (based on the novels by Joseph Conrad and Charlotte Brontë respectively), Symphony No. 2 (Op. 68, 1970), various large-scale choral works with orchestras including the oratorio The Raising of Lazarus (Op. 67, 1970) and Herefordshire Canticles (Op. 93, 1979), a second and third piano sonata (Op. 71, 1972; Op. 157), a second and third string quartet (Op. 91, 1977; Op. 112, 1986), song cycles with piano and/or instrumental ensembles, and accompanied and unaccompanied smaller-scale choral music. On the wide scope of his work, Joubert has commented: [...] "I've never really wanted to be pigeonholed as a composer. I've always wanted to write <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was either asked to, or wanted to write. I've never wanted to specialise, although I have to a certain extent been pigeonholed already. I'd rather not be looked upon as sort of limited in that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Third, {{it appears}} likely that Spinoza {{had already taken}} the {{initiative}} to separate himself from the Talmud Torah congregation and was vocally expressing his hostility to Judaism itself. He had probably stopped attending services at the synagogue, either after the lawsuit with his sister or after the knife attack on its steps. He might already have been voicing the view expressed later in his Theological-Political Treatise that the civil authorities should suppress Judaism as harmful to the Jews themselves. Either for financial or other reasons, he had in any case effectively stopped contributing to the synagogue by March 1656. He had also committed the [...] "monstrous deed," [...] contrary to the regulations of the synagogue and the views of some rabbinical authorities (including Maimonides), of filing suit in a civil court rather than with the synagogue authorities—to renounce his father's heritage, no less. Upon being notified of the issuance of the censure, he {{is reported to have}} said: [...] "Very well; this does not force me to do <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would not have done of my own accord, had I not been afraid of a scandal." [...] Thus, unlike most of the censure issued routinely by the Amsterdam congregation to discipline its members, the censure issued against Spinoza did not lead to repentance and so was never withdrawn.|$|E
