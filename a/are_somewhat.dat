5|$|Lyotropic mesophases are {{analyzed}} {{in a similar}} fashion, though these experiments <b>are</b> <b>somewhat</b> more complex, as the concentration of mesogen is a key factor. These experiments are run at various concentrations of mesogen in order to analyze that impact.|$|E
5|$|The rotor of the Wankel {{engine is}} shaped as a {{curvilinear}} triangle {{that is often}} cited {{as an example of}} a Reuleaux triangle. However, its curved sides <b>are</b> <b>somewhat</b> flatter than those of a Reuleaux triangle and so it does not have constant width.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is greyish-black. Spores are {{narrowly}} elliptical to spindle-shaped, smooth, and measure 17–23 by 4.5–7.5μm. The cystidia <b>are</b> <b>somewhat</b> spindle-shaped or narrowly club-shaped, and measure 112–164 by 13–20µm. They have characteristically thick walls, up to 7.5µm wide {{in the middle}} portion.|$|E

25|$|Wolfberry {{species are}} {{deciduous}} woody perennial plants, growing 1–3 m high.

25|$|The term {{platform}} game <b>is</b> <b>somewhat</b> ambiguous, {{particularly when}} referring to games that predate the widespread, international use of the term.

5|$|Danvers carrots. These {{have strong}} foliage and the roots are longer than Chantaney types, {{and they have}} a conical shape with a {{well-defined}} shoulder, tapering to a point. They <b>are</b> <b>somewhat</b> shorter than Imperator cultivars, but more tolerant of heavy soil conditions. Danvers cultivars store well and are used both fresh and for processing. They were developed in 1871 in Danvers, Massachusetts. Cultivars include 'Danvers Half Long' and 'Danvers 126'.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies {{produce a}} {{yellow-brown}} spore print. Spores are egg-shaped to ellipsoid, smooth, thin-walled, and measure 8.4–10.5 by 4.2–4.9µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 25–35 by 7–9µm. Cystidia are present {{on both the}} tube walls (as pleurocystidia) and abundantly on the edges (as cheilocystidia). They <b>are</b> <b>somewhat</b> spindle-shaped, sometimes with a central swelling, and measure 45–70 by 7–12μm. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae, {{and all of the}} hyphae are inamyloid.|$|E
5|$|Mole cricket fossils are rare. A stem group fossil, Cratotetraspinus, {{is known}} from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil. Two {{specimens}} of Marchandia magnifica in amber {{have been found in}} the Lower Cretaceous of Charente-Maritime in France. They <b>are</b> <b>somewhat</b> more abundant in the Tertiary amber of the Baltic and Dominican regions; impressions are found in Europe and the American Green River Formation.|$|E
50|$|Just as the {{selection}} of axes in the Cartesian coordinate system <b>is</b> <b>somewhat</b> arbitrary, {{the selection}} of a single system of homogeneous coordinates out of all possible systems <b>is</b> <b>somewhat</b> arbitrary. Therefore, it is useful to know how the different systems are related to each other.|$|R

50|$|This crater is not heavily eroded, but the rim <b>is</b> <b>somewhat</b> {{disrupted}} at {{the northern}} and southern ends. To the south the rim has a prominent outward bulge that extends an extra 5-10 km. The interior <b>is</b> <b>somewhat</b> uneven, with low central ridges near the midpoint.|$|R
5|$|Resistance welding {{involves}} {{the generation of}} heat by passing current through the resistance caused by the contact between two or more metal surfaces. Small pools of molten metal are formed at the weld area as high current (1000–100,000 A) is passed through the metal. In general, resistance welding methods are efficient and cause little pollution, but their applications <b>are</b> <b>somewhat</b> limited and the equipment cost can be high.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is olive to olive-brown. The smooth spores <b>are</b> <b>somewhat</b> oblong to {{slightly}} ventricose (fattened in the middle), and measure 10–14 by 4–5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 25–35 by 8–10µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} faces of the tubes) are fuse-shaped and ventricose, with dimensions of 50–60 by 10–14µm.|$|E
5|$|The spores {{are roughly}} spherical to ellipsoidal, {{measuring}} 7.9–9.5 by 8.0–8.8µm. They feature surface ornamentations up to 0.8µm high {{and an almost}} complete reticulum comprising broad, rounded ridges. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) <b>are</b> <b>somewhat</b> cylindrical, four-spored, and measure 50–70 by 9–11µm. The cap cuticle is an ixocutis (made of gelatinous hyphae that run parallel to the cap surface) up to 60µm thick, with hyphae that are 2–6wide that are usually branched and interwoven.|$|E

5|$|The two kingdoms within Kent were {{east and}} west Kent. Western Kent has fewer archaeological finds from the {{earliest}} periods than east Kent, and the eastern finds <b>are</b> <b>somewhat</b> distinct in character, showing Jutish and Frankish influence. The archaeological evidence, combined with the known political division into two kingdoms, makes it likely that {{the origin of the}} subkingdoms was the conquest of the western half by the eastern, which would have been the first area settled by the invaders.|$|E
5|$|The {{wealth of}} galaxies at {{different}} stages of their evolution also allowed astronomers to estimate the variation in the rate of star formation over the lifetime of the Universe. While estimates of the redshifts of HDF galaxies <b>are</b> <b>somewhat</b> crude, astronomers believe that star formation was occurring at its maximum rate 8–10 billion years ago, and has decreased by a factor of about 10 since then.|$|E
5|$|These escaped {{slaves were}} able to defeat a small force of troops sent after them from Capua, and equip {{themselves}} with captured military equipment {{as well as their}} gladiatorial weapons. Sources <b>are</b> <b>somewhat</b> contradictory on the order of events immediately following the escape, but they generally agree that this band of escaped gladiators plundered the region surrounding Capua, recruited many other slaves into their ranks, and eventually retired to a more defensible position on Mount Vesuvius.|$|E

5|$|Tornadoes {{are most}} likely in the spring. Major tornado {{outbreaks}} affected parts of eastern North Carolina on March 28, 1984, and April 16, 2011. The month of May experiences the greatest rise in temperatures. During the spring, there are warm days and cool nights in the Piedmont. Temperatures <b>are</b> <b>somewhat</b> cooler {{in the mountains and}} warmer, particularly at night, near the coast. North Carolina's humidity is lowest in the spring.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{recommendations}} for children <b>are</b> <b>somewhat</b> {{different from those}} for adults. The World Health Organization recommends treating all children less than 5 years of age; children above 5 are treated like adults. The United States guidelines recommend treating all children less than 12 months of age and all those with HIV RNA counts greater than 100,000copies/mL between one year and five years of age.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the temple}} was located in the {{south-east}} corner of the enclosure wall. The entrance led to an open courtyard that stretched from east to west. The ritual cleaning and preparation of the offerings took place here. Because of the extensive degradation suffered by the temple, reconstruction attempts <b>are</b> <b>somewhat</b> speculative. From the ruins, archaeologists propose that the temple comprised an open colonnade, possibly made of granite, a sacrificial chapel adjoining the pyramid side, three statue niches and a few magazine chambers. No traces of a cult pyramid were found onsite. In {{the halls of the}} temple were depictions of animal processions and offerings carriers moving towards the Shrine of the Queen.|$|E
