40|$|We {{establish}} {{the existence of}} time quasicrystals as stable trajectories in dissipative dynamical systems. These tilings of the time axis, with two unit cells of different durations, can be generated as cuts through a periodic lattice spanned by two orthogonal directions of time. We show that there are precisely two admissible time quasicrystals, which we term the infinite Pell and Clapeyron words, reached by a generalization of the period-doubling cascade. Finite Pell and Clapeyron words of increasing length provide systematic periodic approximations to the time quasicrystals which can be verified experimentally. The results apply to <b>all</b> <b>systems</b> <b>featuring</b> the `universal sequence' of periodic windows.

All features have been designed solely with the equestrian sport in mind, as apposed to competitor multipurpose sport designs. This is author's company business concept. The main objectives have been commercial and educational. A brief introductory explanation of the equestrian sport is presented.

Ifighly bandwidth efficient, fixed but arbitrarily programmable rate, perceptually weighted Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) based video codecs are proposed for quarter common intermediate format (QCIF) videophone sequences. Perceptually weighted cost/gain controlled motion compensation and quad-class DCT-based compression is applied with and without run-length coding. Specifically, we propose video codecs having transmission rates In the range of 5 - 11. 36 kbps and preselected the 11. 36 kbps Codec 1, the 8. 52 kbps Codec and the 8 kbps Codec 2 a, for which we designed the intelligent reconfigurable Systems 1 - 5. After sensitivity-matched binary Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) forward error correction (FEC) coding the data rate associated with Codec 1 and Codec 2 a became 20. 32 kbps, while that of Codec 2 was 15. 24 kbps. Throughout these systems a partial forced update (PM) technique was invoked in order to keep transmitter and receiver aligned amongst hostile channel conditions. When using Codec 1 in System 1 and coherent pilot symbol assisted 16 -level quadrature amplitude modulation (16 -PSAQAM), an overall signalling rate of 9 kBd was yielded. Over lower quality channels the 4 QAM mode of operation had to be invoked, which required twice as many time slots to accommodate the resulting 18 kBd stream.

All sensors have {{to be placed on}} the structure so that <b>all</b> sought <b>system</b> <b>features</b> be obtained from the experimental tests. Sensor network design is rather diffused in laboratory applications, but there are scarce investigations on real civil structures, and they are not so well documented. In order to give a contribution in this framework, the present paper deals with the optimal sensor placement problem in lattice towers. With reference to six of the most diffused existing optimum criteria and according to mechanical and energetic formulations, several sensor network configurations are calculated for two broadcasting antennas, adopted as benchmark cases of studies. The final topological configurations of the networks are compared, and the most relevant differences are discussed. Moreover, the information content behaviour is computed to investigate the connection between sensor network topology and its ability to withstand the presence of undesired signals (e. g., noise) during the measurements.

The neutralizer of the interlingual asymmetry that inevitably appears between the compared linguistic systems becomes a cognitive approach to language learning. It may be illustrated by some discrepancies between the French and the Russian language systems that appear on the grammatical and lexical levels transferring some grammatical categories and interlingual lexical homonyms. The cognitive approach to language learning that lies in the basis of the formation of some interlingual lexical homonyms, shows that their values are rarely the same, and the situation where the amount of the value of this kind of vocabulary has significant differences, is quite stereotyped and neutral. In the practice of translation, based on the various manifestations of the relations between the different linguistic cultures, a situation becomes enough frequency where the choice of meanings of different level – not grammatical, lexical or syntactic – is simply inevitable to transfer of any grammatical category, which has no formal counterpart in another language system. </p...|$|R

40|$|Nearly <b>all</b> living <b>systems</b> <b>feature</b> a temperature-independent {{oscillation}} {{period in}} circadian clocks. This ubiquitous property {{occurs at the}} system level and {{is rooted in the}} network architecture of the clock machinery. To investigate the mechanism of this prominent property of the circadian clock and provide general guidance for generating robust genetic oscillators with temperature-compensated oscillations, we theoretically explored the design principle and core network topologies preferred by oscillations with a temperature-independent period. By enumerating all topologies of genetic regulatory circuits with three genes, we obtained four network motifs, namely, a delayed negative feedback oscillator, repressilator, activator-inhibitor oscillator and substrate-depletion oscillator; hybrids of these motifs constitute the vast majority of target network topologies. These motifs are biased in their capacities for achieving oscillations and the temperature sensitivity of the period. The delayed negative feedback oscillator and repressilator are more robust for oscillations, whereas the activator-inhibitor and substrate-depletion oscillators are superior for maintaining a temperature-independent oscillation period. These results suggest that thermally robust oscillation can be more plausibly achieved by hybridizing these two categories of network motifs. Antagonistic balance and temperature insulation mechanisms for achieving temperature compensation are typically found in these topologies with temperature robustness. In the temperature insulation approach, the oscillation period relies on very few parameters, and these parameters are influenced only slightly by temperature. This approach prevents the temperature from affecting the oscillation period and generates circadian rhythms that are robust against environmental perturbations...|$|R

30|$|However, this {{initially}} attractive view can be refuted by {{remembering that}} the overall function of the system network is to describe the potential for meaning making activity in an aspect of a given language. The system network, then, divides up this potential in different ways according to the pragmatic considerations discussed earlier; within the overall potential of linguistic meaning making, {{there are many ways}} of dividing up this potential depending on what the linguist is intending to examine. Considering the lexicogrammatical potential of language, the most abstract way this potential can be divided up is in three: into the simultaneous systems of transitivity, mood, and theme. Many years of linguistic description and hypothesising has told us that there are many more ways to divide up this potential even further. SFL scholars represent these means of further divisions in system networks. However, regardless of the number of ways this potential is split, it still involves the same linguistic capability. The question, then, is not whether a less delicate <b>system</b> <b>feature</b> like indicative is more removed from a situation than a more delicate option like interrogative, but instead the comparison should be made between indicative and <b>all</b> of the <b>system</b> <b>features</b> it dominates.

However, the increased use of these generating units may affect significantly the reliability and overall operational performance of the power systems since their availability level and effective use are restricted by the random and unpredicted weather conditions.
