25|$|The blacktip trevally, Caranx heberi (also {{known as}} the blacktip {{kingfish}} and yellowtail kingfish), is a species of large marine fish classified in the jack family Carangidae. The blacktip trevally is distributed throughout the tropical to subtropical Indian and West Pacific Oceans, ranging from South Africa {{in the west to}} Fiji, Japan and northern Australia in the east. It inhabits coastal waters throughout its range, preferring moderately deep clear waters over rocky and coral reefs.
