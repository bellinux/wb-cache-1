Terrorizer dubbed Enter the Grave the nineteenth best album of 2007, whereas Classic Rock rated the full-length the thirty-eighth best album of 2007.|$|E
500|$|Carnivàle {{was often}} {{compared}} to David Lynch's 1990s mystery TV series Twin Peaks and John Steinbeck's 1939 novel The Grapes of Wrath. Matt Roush of TV Guide called Carnivàle [...] "the perfect show {{for those who}} thought Twin Peaks was too accessible", whereas the show reminded Salon.com's Heather Havrilesky of the [...] "disappointment you feel as a kid {{when you come to}} the last few pages of The Grapes of Wrath." [...] She argued that a [...] "surreal Twin Peaks-style shockfest [...] hardly bears repeating," [...] especially if it [...] "avoid the 'hugging and learning' of mainstream television [...] such <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>diet</b> <b>of</b> anguish and dashed hopes that viewers refuse to take the risk of making an emotional connection." [...] Carnivàle, as The Australian stated, [...] "seems to have been conceived in essentially literary terms" [...] which [...] "can sometimes work on the page but is deadly on the large screen, let alone a small one. It's almost like a biblical injunction against pretension on television." [...] A reviewer admitted his temptation to dismiss the first season of Carnivàle as [...] "too artsy and esoteric" [...] because his lack of involvement prevented him from understanding [...] "what the heck was going on, [...] can be a problem for a dramatic television series." [...] TV Zone however considered Carnivàle [...] "a series like no other and [...] {{the fact that it is}} so open to interpretation surprisingly proves to be one of its greatest strengths." [...] Carnivàle was lauded for bringing [...] "the hopelessness of the Great Depression to life" [...] and for being among the first TV shows to show [...] "unmitigated pain and disappointment", but reviewers were not confident that viewers would find the [...] "slowly unfolding sadness" [...] appealing over long or would have the patience or endurance to find out the meaning of the show.|$|E

6000|$|Quite {{like other}} boys Lowell was {{subjected}} to the processes of the more formal education of books. He was first sent to a [...] "dame school," [...] {{and then to the}} private school of William Wells, under whose rigid tuition he became thoroughly grounded in the classics. Among his schoolfellows was W.W. Story, the poet-sculptor, who continued his life-long friend. Thomas Wentworth Higginson, {{who was one of the}} younger boys of the school, recalls the high talk of Story and Lowell about the Fairie Queen. At fifteen he entered Harvard College, then an institution with about two hundred students. The course of study in those days was narrow and dull, <b>a</b> pretty <b>steady</b> <b>diet</b> <b>of</b> Greek, Latin and Mathematics, with an occasional dessert of Paley's Evidences of Christianity or Butler's Analogy. Lowell was not distinguished for scholarship, but he read omnivorously and wrote copiously, often in smooth flowing verse, fashioned after the accepted English models of the period. He was an editor of Harvardiana, the college magazine, and was elected class poet in his senior year. But his habit of lounging with the poets in the secluded alcoves of the old library, in preference to attending recitations, finally became too scandalous for official forbearance, and he was rusticated, [...] "on account of constant neglect of his college duties," [...] as the faculty records state. He was sent to Concord, where his exile was not without mitigating profit, as he became acquainted with Emerson and Thoreau. Here he wrote the class poem, which he was permitted to circulate in print at his Commencement. This production, which now stands at the head of the list of his published works, was curiously unprophetic of his later tendencies. It was written in the neatly, polished couplets of the Pope type and other imitative metres, and aimed to satirize the radical movements of the period, especially the transcendentalists and abolitionists, with both of whom he was soon to be in active sympathy.|$|R

After seven albums (13 Songs, Repeater, <b>Steady</b> <b>Diet</b> <b>of</b> Nothing, In on the Kill Taker, Red Medicine, End Hits, The Argument), and several tours, Fugazi went on [...] "indefinite hiatus" [...] in 2003.|$|R
25|$|For Fugazi's second studio-album <b>Steady</b> <b>Diet</b> <b>of</b> Nothing, {{released}} in July 1991, the band once again asked Ted Niceley to produce. Niceley {{had become a}} chef and had to reluctantly turn down the job, so the band members decided to produce the record themselves. After the success of Repeater and its subsequent world tour, <b>Steady</b> <b>Diet</b> was highly anticipated, six months prior to its release Dischord had pre-orders in excess of 160,000 for the album.|$|R
50|$|Fugazi {{has been}} on an {{indefinite}} hiatus since 2002.

5000|$|Eating for {{convenience}} and food availability occurs when {{people choose to}} snack on energy-dense food that is readily available. In some areas the only food available is processed food, which is energy-dense and low in essential nutrients.

[...] These foods are high in calories, fat, salt, and have a very low nutrient density.|$|R
50|$|Toward {{the end of}} the {{monotonous}} winter {{they spent}} at Fort Clatsop, the men were desperate to return east.

Dover was host to exhibition runs by the Legendary Don ‘Big Daddy” Garlits, California’s “T.V Tommy Ivo”, the original Batmobile and Jet Cars. Funny Car match races by every major player throughout the sixties and early seventies, served up <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>diet</b> to feed spectators and racer’s appetite for speed.

5000|$|Billboard {{called it}} a [...] "static {{presentation}} of pop tunes" [...] and felt it needed better direction. Billboard gave a very mixed review of WABD's daytime schedule, though the November 10, 1948, edition of Variety commented that the schedule was no more monotonous than [...] "the <b>steady</b> <b>diet</b> <b>of</b> disk jockeys and/or soap operas fed daytime radio listeners". DuMont expected that the shows would be viewed by housewives who were too busy to watch complex shows (as noted in the 2004 book The Forgotten Network by David Weinstein). Despite the mixed reviews, the schedule proved successful enough that other New York City stations began to increase their daytime offerings in response.|$|R
50|$|The Frankenstein's <b>steady</b> <b>diet</b> <b>of</b> {{controversy}} started early, {{with police}} busts for spiking the espresso with brandy and for allowing {{a woman to}} be photographed nude against the inside murals. Both charges were eventually dropped, but the damage had been done. The last straw was when the local ladies Church League came down on them for creating a stained-glass window of the Frankenstein monster. The Church League claimed that stained glass was only {{for use in the}} church, and rallied the community against the Frankenstein. Owner Burt Shonberg threatened to erect a crucified Frankenstein dummy in front of the coffeehouse, if they didn't back off.

5000|$|The {{show and}} its content {{is often cited}} as a {{contributing}} factor to the perceived sense of [...] "entitlement" [...] seen in the Millennial generation who grew up watching the show as children. One specific criticism is:"His shows do not assist children in learning to deal with negative feelings and emotions. As one commentator puts it, the real danger from Barney is 'denial: the refusal to recognize the existence of unpleasant realities. For along with his <b>steady</b> <b>diet</b> <b>of</b> giggles and unconditional love, Barney offers our children a one-dimensional world where everyone must be happy and everything must be resolved right away.'"The creator and performer of the San Diego Chicken mascot, Ted Giannoulas, called Barney a [...] "ubiquitous and insipid creature" [...] in a 1999 court case.|$|R
50|$|Platypus apicalis is {{classified}} as an ambrosia wood boring beetle. Beetles in the category survive by boring tunnels into the xylem (water transport tissue) and phloem (food transport tissue) of a host tree species. Ambrosia beetles have a symbiotic relationship with a category of fungus known as Ambrosia. Fungal spores are contained within the gut of Ambrosia beetles and as beetles bore into a tree, they release the spores. The fungus is then cultivated within the tree and used by the beetles as a food sources. The xylem and phloem tissue of the tree is merely a medium for the fungus, {{it is not a}} source of food for the beetle. Platypus aplicalis do not feed on the wood they bore, instead they eat the yeast that accumulates on the bored tunnels. This yeast provides <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>diet</b> for both adults and larvae (.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Steady</b> <b>Diet</b> <b>of</b> Nothing was {{recorded}} during January and February 1991 at Inner Ear Studios and is notable {{for being the}} group's first self-produced release. As a result of not having an outside producer besides engineer Don Zientara, the album's recording and mixing sessions were tough on the band. Guy Picciotto said of making the record, [...] "it was a tough record for us to make. It was our first attempt at producing and mixing by ourselves, and we didn’t feel like we {{had a really good}} handle, technically, on what we wanted to do. And we were also pretty fried from a shitload of back-to-back touring. I appreciate <b>Steady</b> <b>Diet</b> for <b>a</b> lot <b>of</b> things, but there was a flatness to both the performances and the sound that was weird to us." [...] Singer/guitarist Ian MacKaye explained, [...] "It was like we were walking on eggshells, trying not to offend each other. No one would say, [...] "Turn your guitar down," [...] or, [...] "Turn the drums down." [...] So we ended up getting a democratic mix, {{and a lot of times}} democratic mixes equal bad mixes. And I feel <b>Steady</b> <b>Diet</b> is <b>a</b> classic example of us being very conservative, although a lot of people think it's our best record." ...|$|R
5000|$|There {{were many}} African-Americans that were displeased with {{the images of}} {{themselves}} portrayed in movies such as Super Fly, Sweet Sweetback’s Baadassssss Song, and Shaft.

50|$|Fugazi {{formed in}} Washington, D.C., in 1987 with a lineup of MacKaye, bassist Joe Lally, and drummer Brendan Canty.
