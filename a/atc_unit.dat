5|$|At 22:18 AT (01:18 UTC), ATC Moncton {{handed over}} traffic {{control of the}} plane to Halifax Terminal Control Unit, a {{specialized}} <b>ATC</b> <b>unit</b> managing traffic {{in and out of}} Halifax.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the move}} of its {{transport}} wings, the German Air Force did not station any flying units at Celle Air Base. However, {{air traffic control}} (ATC) was provided by a mixed Army/Air Force unit until the 1990s. Apart from the stationary <b>ATC</b> <b>unit,</b> a mobile <b>ATC</b> <b>unit</b> existed in Celle which was equipped with a mobile tower, radar and other equipment to provide air traffic control services for specially allocated places, for example, on German motorways designed as emergency landing strips during the Cold War.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the Cold War Celle Air Base's {{ability for}} {{instrument}} flights was removed and the emergency landing strips on the motorways were abandoned. Following the removal of ILS as well as approach radar and the corresponding reduction within the <b>ATC</b> <b>unit,</b> the German Air Force finally left the base. Several smaller units were disbanded or relocated and only the Heeresfliegerregiment 16 remained as a flying unit at Celle.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{confusion}} over assigned squawk codes, <b>ATC</b> <b>units</b> will typically be allocated blocks of squawk codes, not overlapping with the blocks of nearby <b>ATC</b> <b>units,</b> to assign at their discretion.|$|R
50|$|Reorganisation {{saw many}} schools cease cadet support and by 1970 Sea Cadet and Air Training Corps (<b>ATC)</b> <b>units</b> had {{decreased}} to 55 units with 3,200 cadets.|$|R
50|$|Not all <b>ATC</b> <b>units</b> {{will use}} radar to {{identify}} aircraft, but they assign squawk codes nevertheless. As an example, London Information - the {{flight information service}} station that covers {{the lower half of}} the UK - does not have access to radar images, but does assign squawk code 1177 to all aircraft that receive a FIS from them. This tells other radar equipped <b>ATC</b> <b>units</b> that that specific aircraft is listening on the London Information radio frequency, in case they need to contact that aircraft.|$|R
2500|$|Systems for {{identifying}} units and organizations {{assigned to the}} airlift changed several times between 1942 and 1945. The final change occurred on 1 August 1944 when the Air Transport Command discontinued the use of station numbers to identify its units and designated them as numbered [...] "AAF Base Units" [...] with parenthetical modifiers describing their function. AAF base units collectively identified all permanent party organizations, including flying units, at any particular non-combat base. The flying units were commonly denoted as lettered squadrons, i.e. [...] "Squadron B," [...] within the Base Unit. To illustrate the various organizational changes affecting the India-China airlift, the unit at Chabua under 10AF deployed overseas as the 1st Ferrying Group. It was redesignated the 1st Transport Group on 1 December 1942 to denote {{that it was an}} <b>ATC</b> <b>unit.</b> Next it became Station No. 6 (APO 629 New York) on 1 December 1943 when for flexibility ATC no longer fielded groups or squadrons as units. Finally it became the 1333rd AAF Base Unit (Foreign Transport Station) on 1 August 1944 in conformance with AAF policy service-wide. Similarly, Headquarters Squadron, Eastern Sector, India-China Wing, established at Chabua on 16 September 1943 to administer the headquarters of the airlift, was redesignated the Headquarters Squadron, Assam Wing on 1 July 1944 when ATC reorganized itself into [...] "divisions" [...] and [...] "wings"; and Squadron A, 1325th AAF Base Unit (HQ Assam Wing) on 1 August 1944.|$|E
5000|$|Flights on {{visual flight}} rules (VFR), when in {{uncontrolled}} airspace, will [...] "squawk VFR" [...] (or conspicuity code in the UK, 1200 in the U.S., 7000 in Europe). Upon contact with an <b>ATC</b> <b>unit,</b> they will be told to squawk a certain unique code. When changing frequency, for instance because the VFR flight leaves controlled airspace or changes to another <b>ATC</b> <b>unit,</b> the VFR flight will be told to [...] "squawk VFR" [...] again.|$|E

50|$|Currently, most {{military}} <b>ATC</b> <b>units</b> use the Australian Defence Air Traffic System. The RAAF use Airservices Australia's TAAATS {{systems in}} Perth to provide approach services to RAAF Base Pearce.|$|R
50|$|Currently, most Airservices Australia <b>ATC</b> <b>units</b> use The Australian Advanced Air Traffic System. The {{introduction}} of the new computerised system increased controllers' productivity. By 2021, Australia will be providing air traffic control services using the most advanced and integrated {{air traffic control system}} in the world known as OneSKY which will unify Australian skies under a new, harmonised air traffic management system.|$|R
40|$|Digital systems which {{deal with}} {{functions}} outside the aircraft in commercial aviation are discussed with attention to navigation and communication. New systems of {{air traffic control}} (ATC) are described, including time division multiple access (TDMA) to ground-based <b>ATC</b> <b>units</b> and to the Navstar/GPS (global positioning system). Such innovations are expected to come on-line before the mid- 1980 s, and greatly increase air safety, {{while at the same}} time making a pilot's work easier...|$|R
50|$|At 22:18 AT (01:18 UTC), ATC Moncton {{handed over}} traffic {{control of the}} plane to Halifax Terminal Control Unit, a {{specialized}} <b>ATC</b> <b>unit</b> managing traffic {{in and out of}} Halifax.|$|E
50|$|The {{seamless}} integration of all Units permits {{the application of}} 5NM separation minima throughout the total covered area, also at transfers of traffic from one <b>ATC</b> <b>unit</b> to the next one. 3NM separation can be done following an in-depth operational evaluation of the ARTAS behaviour in the local environments.|$|E
50|$|After {{the end of}} the Cold War Celle Air Base's {{ability for}} {{instrument}} flights was removed and the emergency landing strips on the motorways were abandoned. Following the removal of ILS as well as approach radar and the corresponding reduction within the <b>ATC</b> <b>unit,</b> the German Air Force finally left the base.

50|$|Oceanic ATC {{operations}} at the Prestwick Centre are undertaken using the Nav Canada designed ATC flight data system, Gander Automated Air Traffic System+ (GAATS+). GAATS+ has been in service with NATS since November 2014. (Located close to Gander International Airport, Newfoundland, Canada, is the Nav Canada Gander ATC centre {{which is responsible for}} flights in the northwest part of the North Atlantic.) GAATS+ enables controllers to maintain accurate flight data, undertake communications with flights and electronically communicate with adjacent <b>ATC</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Class G: All {{remaining}} airspace, comprising by far {{the largest}} part of the airspace below FL 195. The UK is unusual in that it has not adopted a widespread class E system of airways for most airspace lower than FL 70. Therefore, for light aircraft, IFR flight in Class G airspace is relatively common. Use of a radio or transponder is not required, even in IMC. <b>ATC</b> <b>units</b> may provide an [...] "as far as practical" [...] form of separation between some such flights, but participation in the service is voluntary.|$|R
50|$|<b>ATC's</b> <b>unit</b> {{replacement}} {{program was}} continuing, however, and on 1 December 1973, the wing replaced another Major Command wing, the 3550th Pilot Training Wing, at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia. The 38th performed pilot training until 21 November 1975, when preparations to transfer Moody to Tactical Air Command were completed. On 1 December 1975 the 347th Tactical Fighter Wing moved to Moody from Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand {{and the mission}} of the base changed from pilot training to an tactical fighter operations. The 38th FTW was inactivated on 1 December 1975, with the personnel and equipment of its support units transferring to the 347th Wing.|$|R
5000|$|In Iraq, The Flight Information Regions (FIR) {{is known}} as Baghdad FIR. It is {{classified}} into Class A, D, E and G airspace. Class B, C and F airspace are not used in the Baghdad FIR. Air traffic services are provided in all controlled airspace, by the controlling <b>ATC</b> <b>Unit,</b> based on an ATS Surveillance System (supplemented by procedural non-ATS Surveillance System procedures) or MRU where authorized based on Procedural (non- ATC Surveillance System) procedures and supplemented by ATC Surveillance System where possible.|$|E
50|$|They are {{supported}} at <b>ATC</b> <b>unit</b> level by fellow RAFVR(T) officers, {{as well as}} uniformed ATC Warrant Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers and a cadre of Civilian Instructors. Although not {{in the chain of}} command, the wings {{are supported}} by a Wing Executive Officer of Sqn Ldr Rank in the RAFR. At CCF(RAF) contingents, RAFVR(T) officers are able to call upon the support of the regular RAF Squadron Leader tasked with looking after their area, and also upon the services of the regular RAF 'TEST' sergeants mapped to their specific school. Volunteer Gliding Squadron (VGS) and Air Experience Flight (AEF) officers are supported directly by HQ Air Cadet Staff, and the unit's parent RAF station.|$|E
5000|$|... 44 Wing (44WG) {{was formed}} to {{centrally}} manage ATC personnel and facilities at 11 Defence bases. 44 Wing is an Air Command unit, belonging to the Surveillance and Response Group and is headquartered at RAAF Base Williamtown, Williamtown, NSW. 44WG {{is divided into two}} squadrons; No. 452 Squadron which consists of all ATC units at bases north of the Queensland border, and No. 453 Squadron which consists of ATC units at bases south of the Queensland border. The <b>ATC</b> <b>unit</b> established at each base in known as a flight and belongs to one of the two squadrons. Each flight manages air traffic control services at the base, although is ultimately commanded from HQ452SQN, RAAF Base Darwin or HQ453SQN RAAF Base Williamtown.|$|E
50|$|The {{final stage}} is to note which areas the route will pass through or over, {{and to make}} a note of all of the things to be done - which <b>ATC</b> <b>units</b> to contact, the {{appropriate}} frequencies, visual reporting points, and so on. It is also important to note which pressure setting regions will be entered, so that the pilot can ask for the QNH (air pressure) of those regions. Finally, the pilot should have in mind some alternative plans in case the route cannot be flown for some reason - unexpected weather conditions being the most common. At times the pilot may be required to file a flight plan for an alternate destination and to carry adequate fuel for this. The more work a pilot can do on the ground prior to departure, the easier it will be in the air.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The "mistakes, forgetfulness, and {{negligence}} " {{accidents in}} Air Traffic Control (ATC) {{have a great}} impact on flight safety. On the basis of Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), the paper established the "mistakes, forgetfulness, and negligence " accidents in ATC fault tree, obtained all the minimal cut sets, and qualitatively analyzed the cause of accidents. According to survey data, the paper calculated the probability of the top event, as well as the probability importance degree coefficients and critical importance degree coefficients of basic events, and quantitatively analyzed the cause of accidents. The results show that the weak sense of responsibility, poor safety awareness, unsound rules and regulations, inadequate enforcement of rules and regulations, and high control office noise are the main factors leading to the accident. The paper provides <b>ATC</b> <b>units</b> with recommendations to establish solutions to "mistakes, forgetfulness, and negligence " accidents in ATC. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>ATC</b> transport <b>units,</b> elements of the Tenth Air Force 380th Bombardment Group, 375th Bombardment Squadron operated B-24 Liberators from the airfield, flying long range bombardment missions into Burma, south China, Thailand (Bangkok) and well as French Indochina (Haiphong). A total of 8 B-24s were lost. Also the B-24s were used to ferry aircraft fuel into China.|$|R
50|$|Remaining in American hands {{after the}} war, the first postwar unit at Orly was an Air Transport Command (<b>ATC)</b> <b>unit,</b> the 1408th Army Air Force (AAF) Base Unit which arrived in early 1945. Orly Airport was heavily damaged by bombing raids during the war, {{and with the}} German Capitulation in May 1945, plans were made to {{reconstruct}} the facility {{and return it to}} civil control as Paris' main civil airport for Air France's international flights. ATC also operated a military air terminal at the older and smaller Le Bourget Airport (ALG A-54) until May 1946 when it was re-opened for commercial air travel and Air France re-established its major aircraft maintenance facilities at the field and for domestic service. At both Orly and Le Bourget Airports, ramp space was becoming more and more crowded.|$|E
5000|$|Adjacent to the {{entrance}} to Bournemouth Airport was the College of Air Traffic Control, operated by NATS, the now privatised provider of air traffic control services in the UK. Established by the Ministry of Civil Aviation as the School of Air Traffic Control in 1949, the establishment was retitled College in 1962. [...] Students from home and abroad were trained {{in all aspects of}} ATC operations and went on to work throughout the world. Electronic computer-based ATC simulators were widely employed. Usefully situated at an operational airfield, for a considerable period training in Approach Radar Control was facilitated by the airport <b>ATC</b> <b>unit.</b> Students were able to practise live radar control exercises using temporarily detached Civil Aviation Flying Unit Dove aircraft as live targets. The building was also the home to the Air Traffic Control Evaluation Unit, responsible for developing technology used within the service.|$|E

50|$|All RAFVR(T) {{officers}} {{are required to}} attend and pass the Officers' Initial Course (OIC) held at the Adult Training Facility (ATF), a lodger unit at RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire, usually within the first 12 months of their appointment. This week-long course covers the basic roles and responsibilities of an RAFVR(T) Officer and very few fail. Those successfully completing the course are awarded their commissioning parchment and are confirmed as a commissioned officer (although under the current system, all VR(T) Officers are commissioned from the day that they pass their board, and the commissioning scroll is dated to that day) and are treated similarly to regular Officers. Another 1-week course at the ATF, the Squadron Commanders' Course, is required for those seeking to command a squadron.RAFVR(T) officers involved in CCF or <b>ATC</b> <b>Units</b> may undertake extra training before becoming appointed as an Officer Commanding of their unit, although this training is not compulsory for officers associated with the CCF. Some also take specialist training for certain activities: physical training (PT) or shooting for example.|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{application}} of Air Traffic Control (ATC) competence reference models as {{a mean of}} air navigation services provider’s charge optimization is described in the article, and this issue is interpretated as an optimization task. The data relating to the significant growth of aviation traffic, especially using the airspace of Ukraine, given by authors, and the statement of fact that Air Traffic Management (ATM) system’s technical component reliability increasement takes place {{on the basis of}} practically invariable psychophysiological abilities of aviation controller, make the substantiation of ANSP provision with the most trained ATC controllers for the work on the working places of <b>ATC</b> <b>Unit</b> actual. The ‘mechanism’ of ATC controllers competence reference model creation is defined step-by step. There is an example of candidate’s for the working place competence quantitative individual model forming as a common criteria of competence, which, in its turn, is the compressed format of all parameters of its working activity, received at the stage of control. The approach, according to which the individual parameters of graduating student’s output model’s professional characteristics, which he received after the examination of his work as Tower controller (ATM Unit of aerodrome control service), approach controller or area control service controller, are compared with the predetermined specialist’s competence reference model, relating to the special working place in ATM system, is supposed here.

50|$|Upon {{completion}} of the B-17 training program, in October 1943, Great Falls Army Air Base {{was transferred to the}} Air Transport Command (<b>ATC)</b> and <b>units</b> from Gore Field were transferred to the base. The base was considerably expanded with more buildings were constructed including a consolidated mess, a post exchange, a theater, and a 400-bed hospital. Air Transport Command also established aerial port facilities for passengers and cargo, as well as a flight service center. The ATC 90th Ferrying Squadron was assigned to the base which performed operations in support of the Lend Lease Program with the Soviet Union.|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{aircraft}} loadmaster career field was not formally {{established by the}} US Air Force until 1953, duties eventually assumed by loadmasters began early in World War II when laundry personnel assigned to Air Corps quartermaster units began flying on troop carrier transports in the Australia and New Guinea, later in the China-Burma-India area of operations, to eject cargo bundles they have previously prepared for airdrop from the doors over drop zones. By 1944 the IX Troop Carrier Command in Europe included personnel designated as [...] "dropmasters" [...] in its troop carrier squadrons. Also in 1944 the Air Transport Command began assigning enlisted men, most {{of whom had been}} in training for aircrew duty in other fields, including pilots, navigators and bombardiers, as [...] "flight clerks." [...] The first flight clerks were assigned to special flights known as [...] "Red Ball" [...] which were set up to deliver crucial aircraft parts to <b>ATC</b> <b>units</b> in India assigned to the India-China Ferry. By the end of the war, flight clerks were flying on most four-engine transports to be responsible for cargo manifests and take care of passengers. Weight and balance computation {{does not appear to have}} initially been one of their duties, although it has been associated with the loadmaster career field since it was established. They were given the MOS 2967 - Flight Traffic Clerk. The new MOS was obviously an outgrowth of the 967 MOS, which had been given to men assigned to air cargo units as air traffic specialists.|$|R
5000|$|Glider pilots {{often can}} {{use any of}} three {{different}} call signs. Since most (not all) gliders now show standard CAA general aviation registrations e.g. G-xxxx they can call using the same call sign and abbreviation rules as other light aircraft. This has long been in {{the case in the}} United States. Before these registrations came in (between 2004 and 2008) they used to use and normally still do use either a three letter code issued to all gliders by the British Gliding Association known as the aircraft's Trigraph e.g. XYZ normally calling ATC as [...] "Glider X-ray, Yankee, Zulu" [...] or if they paid extra could get from the BGA a numeric or mixed numeric and letter code known as a competition number for marking their aircraft and as a call sign. For Example R4 [...] "Romeo Four", or 26 [...] "Two Six" [...] or F1 [...] "Foxtrot One". Optionally gliders will normally tag on the [...] "Glider" [...] in front of their call sign when calling <b>ATC</b> <b>units</b> so that the controller knows for example that the glider will be unable to maintain a particular height as Gliders are normally either descending in a straight glide or circling to climb.Some gliders are still not required to carry a CAA General Aviation type registration as they are older designs or prototypes and can therefore only continue to just use their Trigraph or Competition number as a call sign. These are known as Annex II aircraft as they are listed in EASA Annex II.|$|R
