50|$|A 14 km2 {{section of}} wetland around Lake Muir has been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it provides habitat for 10 or more pairs of endangered <b>Australasian</b> <b>bitterns.</b> The wetlands within the IBA are shallow with extensive beds of dense sedgeland and fringing stands of shrubland and woodland. Lake Muir has been excluded from the IBA as it is unsuitable for bitterns but it has supported large numbers of Australian Shelduck and {{may prove to be}} globally significant for that species.|$|R
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because the riverine red gum forest constitutes one of three breeding areas of the vulnerable superb parrot.

Noteworthy sightings recorded here include the blue-billed duck and the rare <b>Australasian</b> <b>bittern.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{wetlands}} {{have been}} identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because they support large numbers of nesting waterbirds when flooded. Birds include the largest colony of straw-necked ibises (with up to 200,000 pairs), over 1% of the world populations of Australian pelicans and black-fronted dotterels, and small numbers of endangered <b>Australasian</b> <b>bitterns.</b> [...] Other birds which have been recorded in relatively large numbers include pied, little black and great cormorants, freckled and pink-eared ducks, black swans, glossy ibises, whiskered terns, royal spoonbills and darters.|$|R

Some 89% of the swamp is protected within the Benger Swamp Nature Reserve, while the remaining 11%, mainly in the northern part, is privately owned. It is a seasonally important site for waterbirds and is classified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area, with special regard to the conservation of freckled ducks and <b>Australasian</b> <b>bitterns.</b> Water levels in the swamp are controlled artificially and are managed both for waterbird conservation and for farming.|$|R
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports over 1% of the world populations of sharp-tailed sandpipers, and sometimes of blue-billed and musk ducks, when water levels are suitable. It also provides habitat for diamond firetails. [...] Other birds of conservation significance present at the wetlands include black-backed and <b>Australasian</b> <b>bitterns,</b> freckled ducks, <b>Australasian</b> shovellers, white-bellied sea-eagles, peregrine falcons, Latham's snipes, Baillon’s and spotless crakes, yellow-tailed black cockatoos, southern emu-wrens, chestnut-rumped heathwrens, diamond and beautiful firetails, and black-chinned honeyeaters.
