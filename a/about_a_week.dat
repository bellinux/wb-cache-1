For <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> the system remained weak and changed directions several times; after an eastward movement, it {{turned to the}} northwest, curved to the southeast, and later began a steady track to the southwest.

The wave traveled westward with minimal tropical cyclogenesis and reached the Lesser Antilles <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> later. While passing through the islands, heavy rainfall and strong winds were reported. Eventually, the system developed into a broad area of low pressure and acquired a low-level circulation. However, upper-level wind shear resulted in no immediate further organization. After crossing Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, wind shear decreased, since the low was moving {{in the same direction as}} the upper-level winds.|$|E

The passage of the cyclone also left several buildings, roads, and crop fields damaged.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after hatching, turtles are {{dependent}} on egg yolk material for sustenance. <b>About</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> to {{a week and a}} half after emerging from their eggs (or the following spring if emergence is delayed), hatchlings begin feeding to support growth. The young turtles grow rapidly at first, sometimes doubling their size in the first year. Growth slows sharply at sexual maturity and may stop completely. Likely owing to differences of habitat and food by water body, growth rates often differ from population to population in the same area. Among the subspecies, the western painted turtles are the quickest growers.|$|E
