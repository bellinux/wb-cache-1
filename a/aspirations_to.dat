In their reflection of classical antiquity they resonate with Pope Julius' <b>aspirations</b> <b>to</b> lead Italy towards a new 'age of gold'; at the same time, they staked Michelangelo's claim to greatness. However, a number of critics were angered by their presence and nudity, including Pope Adrian VI who wanted the ceiling stripped.|$|E
40|$|AbstractResearch {{has shown}} that {{self-motivation}} and <b>aspiration</b> <b>to</b> learn affect academic performance. Hence, this study examines effects of the FLEP program on motivation and <b>aspiration</b> <b>to</b> learn among low-achievers.

The students were given a module consisted of 120 fun learning enrichment activities in mathematics and science that promotes self-motivation and <b>aspiration</b> <b>to</b> learn. Results show that prior to intervention, the students had low motivation and aspiration. After intervention, their motivation and <b>aspiration</b> <b>to</b> learn increased consecutively...|$|R

5|$|After {{retiring}} from the Marine Corps, Bolt, then 40 years old, began a new career in agriculture. He and his wife moved back to Sanford, Florida, where he worked for Chase & Co. He remained in that position for five years, until 1967. That year, he decided to follow his original career <b>aspirations</b> <b>to</b> be a lawyer. He enrolled in the College of Law at the University of Florida, where his son Robert was also in attendance. The two formed an American handball team during their spare time, and won several tournaments. Bolt's program had a three-year curriculum, but he completed the degree in 27 months, graduating with a Juris Doctor degree in December 1969. For two years after graduation, he stayed with the university to teach, and from 1969 to 1971 he was a law professor {{as well as the}} president of the Board of Trustees of Alpha Tau Omega, the fraternity he had joined while an undergraduate at the university.|$|E
5|$|F.C. United {{were formed}} in 2005 {{by a group}} of Manchester United {{supporters}} following the club's controversial takeover by Malcolm Glazer which led to hundreds of supporters defecting from the club. Without a stadium of their own they agreed to use Bury's Gigg Lane stadium, but the agreement continued at the cost of approximately £5,000 per match. Within a year, the fan-owned club set <b>aspirations</b> <b>to</b> build its own 7,000 to 10,000 capacity stadium as close to Manchester city centre as possible by 2012 and consequently entered into negotiations with New East Manchester and Manchester City Council to develop their plans. Despite attendances averaging over 2,000 in their first few seasons, the fact that the club did not have access to a stadium of its own on its match days was a contributory factor in the club's financial loss for three years (£42,267 in 2007, £40,669 in 2008 and £9,663 in 2009).|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{promoted}} and practised the Führerprinzip. The principle required absolute obedience of all subordinates {{to their}} superiors; thus Hitler viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himself—the infallible leader—at the apex. Accordingly, Himmler placed {{himself in a}} position of subservience to Hitler, and was unconditionally obedient to him. However, he—like other top Nazi officials—had <b>aspirations</b> <b>to</b> one day succeed Hitler as leader of the Reich. Himmler considered Speer to be an especially dangerous rival, both in the Reich administration and as a potential successor to Hitler. Speer refused to accept Himmler's offer of the high rank of SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer, as he felt to do so would put him in Himmler's debt and obligate him to allow Himmler a say in armaments production.|$|E

Bush to the presidency, followed by the election in 1992 of Bill Clinton which left them totally out of power. The neoconservatives, along with their conservative Christian allies, attempt to demonize Clinton throughout his presidency with various real and fabricated stories of corruption and immorality. To their disappointment, the American people do not turn against Clinton. Meanwhile, Islamist attempts at revolution end in massive bloodshed, leaving the Islamists without popular support. Zawahiri and bin Laden flee to the relative safety of Afghanistan and declare a new strategy. To fight Western-inspired moral decay, they must deal a blow to its source: the United States.|$|E
5|$|Malouma {{commenced}} {{her education}} at {{elementary school in}} 1965 in Mederdra. She qualified as {{an elementary school teacher}} in 1974 in Rosso. According to the traditions of her country, those of the Meidah family are required to carry on the art of their ancestors. As a result, she had to give up her <b>aspirations</b> <b>to</b> teach. Members of each caste are allowed only to marry other members of society within the same caste and the entire society is divided by castes politically, economically, and culturally. Movement outside of a particular caste is forbidden. She learned to play the traditional stringed instruments only women play, especially the ardin harp, and was taught traditional Mauritanian music by her father, who enjoyed an eclectic mix of music. As a result, she grew up listening to classical western works such as Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart, Vivaldi and Wagner, as well as the music of traditional Berber, Egyptian, Lebanese and Senegalese artists. She often accompanied her parents who sang traditional griots.|$|E

He eventually arrived in England and resumed his education. He graduated from the University of Liverpool School of Medicine, and worked in the UK until 1963 at which time he moved to the United States. He completed his anesthesiology residency at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York. He also worked as an associate attending anesthesiologist and respiratory consultant for other hospitals including the Veterans Administration Hospital, and the UHS Chenango Memorial Hospital in Norwich, New York before moving to Lubbock, Texas where he became the first Chairman of Anesthesiology for the then-new Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC).

5|$|Balmer relinquished {{command of}} No.100 Squadron in April 1943, and was posted from the South West Pacific to the European theatre that June. His planned {{secondment}} to the RAF was for two years. Partly {{in an effort}} to bolster Australian <b>aspirations</b> <b>to</b> form a distinct RAAF group within RAF Bomber Command, in August he was appointed commanding officer of No.467 Squadron, based at RAF Bottesford, Leicestershire. The squadron had been raised under Article XV of the Empire Air Training Scheme, and operated Avro Lancaster heavy bombers. Balmer led his unit in a costly raid on Nuremberg the night of 27/28August, before attacking Hanover in September and October. From its new base at RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, Balmer then took No.467 Squadron through the Battle of Berlin that commenced in November 1943 and continued until March 1944. The statistical likelihood of surviving an operational tour of 30 missions in Bomber Command was never more than 50 per cent, and during the Battle of Berlin, loss rates were far higher. No.467 Squadron was the only Australian unit to take part in all sixteen heavy attacks against the German capital during the battle. In the same period it also raided Frankfurt, Leipzig, Stettin, Stuttgart, Essen, and Augsburg.|$|E
5|$|Sources for William's actions between 1082 and 1084 are meagre. According to the {{historian}} David Bates, this probably means that little happened of note, and that because William {{was on the}} continent, {{there was nothing for}} the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to record. In 1082 William ordered the arrest of his half-brother Odo. The exact reasons are unclear, as no contemporary author recorded what caused the quarrel between the half-brothers. Orderic Vitalis later recorded that Odo had <b>aspirations</b> <b>to</b> become pope. Orderic also related that Odo had attempted to persuade some of William's vassals to join Odo on an invasion of southern Italy. This would have been considered tampering with the king's authority over his vassals, which William would not have tolerated. Although Odo remained in confinement for the rest of William's reign, his lands were not confiscated. More difficulties struck in 1083, when William's eldest son Robert rebelled once more with support from the French king. A further blow was the death of Matilda, William's wife, on 2 November 1083. William was always described as close to his wife, and her death would have added to his problems.|$|E
5|$|Before the war, {{nationalism}} {{had been}} largely absent in officers of the Austro-Hungarian Army, but this changed during the war, {{and by the end}} of the war, the propaganda of the Entente had combined with wider <b>aspirations</b> <b>to</b> encourage nationalist sentiment. In some cases, this resulted in mutiny among units of the Austro-Hungarian Army in the last months of the war. The states that would succeed Austria-Hungary were approved by the Allies on 28 October 1918, and the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary was dissolved three days later. Many new nation states emerged in the territory formerly belonging to the realm, as nationalist movements called for greater autonomy or full independence. The Duchy of Styria was divided between the new states of German-Austria and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, but the exact line of the new border was unclear. In November 1918, Mikl had returned to his hometown of Radkersburg, an important railway junction point, which was of economic importance to both sides. The Slovenes occupied the city on 1 December 1918. In 1919, Mikl served as adjutant in the 1st Battalion of the Volkswehr militia, which used arms provided by the provincial government of Carinthia to make an unsuccessful attempt to recapture Radkersburg from forces of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to ensure it remained part of German-Austria. The provincial government of Styria, which had not supported these actions, subsequently issued a warrant ordering Mikl's arrest for treason. Despite his failure, his actions were very important in demonstrating to those negotiating the final border that towns along the northern bank of the Mura river were German. When the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye was signed later in 1919, Radkersburg was retained within what became the First Austrian Republic.|$|E

30|$|The {{following}} {{results are}} based on the first and third questions, which refer <b>to</b> students’ <b>aspiration</b> <b>to</b> study and work. These questions highlight the intersection between the academic and vocational tracks that FVB students face after graduation. Because there are also many FVB students who wish to do both (study and work), three groups were created: (1) FVB students who wish to study but not work (study group), (2) FVB students who wish to work but not study (work group) and (3) FVB students who wish to work and study (mixed group). The two variables (<b>aspiration</b> <b>to</b> study and <b>aspiration</b> <b>to</b> work) were dichotomised (1 and 2  = “wish to study/work”, 3 and 4  = “don’t wish to study/work”).|$|R
5|$|Emraan Hashmi, who {{appeared}} in the original film, was initially chosen to play the lead role. However, Luthria was looking for an older actor and chose Kumar {{for the role of}} Shoaib Khan (based on Dawood Ibrahim). In February 2012 it was announced that there were two male leads in the film, the second said to be Shahid Kapoor, but the following month Imran Khan was confirmed as the second male lead. Many actresses were considered for the female lead, including Illeana D'Cruz, Kareena Kapoor, Kangana Ranaut, Asin Thottumkal, Sonam Kapoor and Deepika Padukone, but in April it was reported that Sonakshi Sinha had been cast. Sonali Bendre was also signed as a lead character in the film. The film marked Bendre's first role since Shankar Dada MBBS. Bendre did not charge her fees for the film owing to the fact that Sobha Kapoor, one of the producers of the film has been the friend of her Mother-in-law for the past 40 years also out of gratitude for Luthria, who shot her first song Sambhala hai Maine in the 1994 film Naaraaz. In November 2012, it was announced that the film was scheduled for release on Eid 2013. TV actor Chetan Hansraj was signed as an antagonist in the film. Kumar revealed during the trailer launch of the film about having no <b>aspirations</b> <b>to</b> set new benchmarks on a role previously enacted by Hashmi. Khan in preparation {{for his role in the}} film drew inspiration from Jackie Shroff and Anil Kapoor, copying their mannerisms, behaviour and dressing style by watching DVD's of films starring them produced in the 1980s. Back in those days copying mannerism of film stars drew appreciation from peers.|$|E
