5|$|The SR V class, more {{commonly}} known as the Schools class, is a class of steam locomotive designed by Richard Maunsell for the Southern Railway. The class was a cut down version of his Lord Nelson class but also incorporated components from Urie and Maunsell's LSWR/SR King Arthur class. It was the last locomotive in Britain to be designed with a 4-4-0 wheel arrangement, and was the most powerful class of 4-4-0 ever produced in Europe. All 40 of the class were named after English public schools, and were designed to provide a powerful class of intermediate express passenger locomotive on semi-fast services for lines which could cope with high <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> but some of which had short turntables. Because of the use of a ‘’King Arthur’’ firebox, rather than the square-topped Belpaire firebox used on the Lord Nelsons, the class could be used on lines with a restricted loading gauge and some of the best performance by the class was on the heavily restricted Tonbridge to Hastings line. The locomotives performed well from the beginning but were subject to various minor modifications to improve their performance over the years. The class operated until 1961 when mass withdrawals took place and all had gone by December 1962. Three examples are now preserved on heritage railways in Britain.|$|E
25|$|Shinkansen uses a 25kV AC {{overhead}} power supply (20 kV AC on Mini-shinkansen lines), {{to overcome the}} limitations of the 1,500 V direct current used on the existing electrified narrow-gauge system. Power is distributed along the axles of the train to reduce the heavy <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> under single power cars. The power supply for the Tokaido Shinkansen is 60Hz.|$|E
25|$|As {{the main}} {{international}} railway out of Norway, the Østfold Line {{had some of}} the highest demands for speed and <b>axle</b> <b>loads.</b> In an effort to increase train weights and speeds, the Norwegian State Railways approved an upgrade plan in 1910 which was initially to be completed by 1919. All bridges and track was to be upgraded to tolerate a higher train weight. The break-out of the First World War led to material and funding shortages, and the upgrades were not completed until a new Sarp Bridge was finished in 1930.|$|E

30|$|The {{weight of}} the vehicle {{is one of the}} {{parameters}} that can affect the response of the bridge directly. Especially when the load is dynamic, the response can be amplified with respect to static loads. Three different truck loads were employed to examine this parameter; partially (83 %) loaded HS 15 - 44 truck (SP- 17), fully loaded H 15 - 44 truck (SP- 0), and fully loaded HS 20 - 44 truck (SP- 14). SP- 0, SP- 14, and SP- 17 have properties of such weights. All the trucks represent a class-V vehicle (according to AASHTO) with one rear and one front axle. The distance between axles is 14 ft. H 20 - 44 truck has rear <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 32  kips and front <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 8  kips. H 15 - 44 truck has rear <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 24  kips and front <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 6  kips; whereas, the partially loaded H 15 - 44 truck has rear <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 20  kips and front <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 5  kips.|$|R
25|$|In 2004, {{the basic}} TRAXX design was {{subjected}} to a major overhaul, with the carbody and the front redesigned to suit current crashworthiness standards, and the replacement of GTO thyristor based inverters with IGBT based inverters. The option of individual axle control in place of individual bogie control was also introduced. The coolant of the inverters and the main transformer was also changed from ester to water. The carbody design was completely standardised, by default providing a space for the mounting of a flip-disc display above the windshield, which is covered by a non-structural hood in freight versions. The bogie frame was strengthened, to allow an increase of <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> to 22 tons. This generation of the family is {{also referred to as}} the TRAXX2 platform, and is sometimes also indicated with a number 2 {{at the end of the}} type designations.|$|E

2500|$|Construction of the Ofoten Line {{started in}} 1898 {{along with the}} Ore Line from Riksgränsen to Kiruna. They were {{completed}} in 1902, allowing LKAB to haul ore from their mines in Kiruna to the ice-free Port of Narvik. Operation and ownership of the line was held by the Norwegian State Railways. The line was electrified in 1915 and NSB started using El 3 and El 4 locomotives. During World War II, the ore traffic stopped because of the Battles of Narvik and {{the bombing of the}} town. In the following decades, NSB introduced El 12 and El 15 locomotives. In 1996, operation of the ore trains was taken over by Malmtrafik, which was controlled by and now is a subsidiary of the mining company LKAB. The same year, ownership of the railway line was transferred to the newly created Norwegian National Rail Administration.

2500|$|Asphalt {{overlays}} {{are sometimes}} laid over distressed concrete {{to restore a}} smooth wearing surface. A disadvantage of this method is that movement in the joints between the underlying concrete slabs, whether from thermal expansion and contraction, or from deflection of the concrete slabs from truck <b>axle</b> <b>loads,</b> usually causes [...] reflective cracks in the asphalt. To decrease reflective cracking, concrete pavement is broken apart through a break and seat, crack and seat, or rubblization process. Geosynthetics {{can be used for}} reflective crack control. With break and seat and crack and seat processes, a heavy weight is dropped on the concrete to induce cracking, then a heavy roller is used to seat the resultant pieces into the subbase. The main difference between the two processes is the equipment used to break the concrete pavement {{and the size of the}} resulting pieces. The theory is frequent small cracks will spread thermal stress over a wider area than infrequent large joints, reducing the stress on the overlying asphalt pavement. Rubblization is a more complete fracturing of the old, worn-out concrete, effectively converting the old pavement into an aggregate base for a new asphalt road.|$|E
2500|$|For railway {{locomotive}} applications {{the main}} benefit sought from compounding is economy in fuel and water consumption plus high power/weight ratio due to temperature and pressure drop taking place {{over a longer}} cycle, this resulting in increased efficiency; additional perceived advantages include more even torque and in many cases, superior riding qualities with consequent less wear on the track. In situations where heavy grades and low <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> were combined, the ordinary compound locomotive was often deemed {{to be the most}} viable solution. However, in the past, optimum performance demanded constant attention and expert handling, which usually made single-manning advisable, thus reducing a locomotive's availability. At the end of the steam age, this particular problem was being addressed by Andre Chapelon, and Livio Dante Porta also actively pursued this line of research. Successful design of a compound locomotive demands a firm grasp of thermo- and fluid dynamics; that such has frequently not been the case is why many productions in the past have been far from optimal. This is especially true of locomotives built {{in the early years of}} the 20th century. The problem not only affected compounds, but was dramatic in their case due to the long steam cycle which made them particularly sensitive to temperature-drop and condensation of the steam during its lengthy passage. In rebuilding older locomotives from 1929 onwards, Chapelon was able to inexpensively obtain what seemed almost [...] "magical" [...] improvements in power and economy by improving flow through the steam circuit, at the same time putting in a larger superheater in order to increase the initial steam temperature so that cooling took longer. [...] Subsequently, in order to maintain a more constant temperature throughout the cycle, Chapelon successfully applied re-superheating between HP and LP stages plus steam-jacketed cylinders to a [...] "test-bed" [...] freight locomotive, 160 A1 (tested 1948-51). Resuperheating was also a feature of L.D. [...] Porta's prototype 4-8-0 rebuild: 'Presidente Peron'/'Argentina' (tested around the same time in Argentina from 1949). Proponents of simple expansion argue that use of early cut-off in the cylinder thus expanding small quantities of steam at each piston stroke obviates the need for the complication and initial expense of compounding and indeed multi-cylinder single expansion – this is an ongoing debate.|$|E

40|$|Most design {{methods for}} road {{pavements}} require the design traffic, {{based on the}} transformation of the traffic spectrum, to be calculated into a number of equivalent passages of a standard axle using the equivalent <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> factors. Generally, these factors only consider the type of axle (single, tandem or tridem), but they do not consider the type of wheel on the axles, i. e., single or dual wheel. The type of wheel has an important influence on the calculation of the design traffic. The existing design methods assume that the equivalent <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> factors are valid for all pavement structures and do not consider the thickness and stiffness of the pavement layers. This paper presents the results of the development of a model for the calculation of the equivalent <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> factors considering the type of axle, the type of wheel and the constitution of the pavement. The model was developed based on the tensile strain {{at the bottom of the}} asphalt layer that is responsible for bottom-up cracking in asphalt pavement, which is the most widely considered distress mode for flexible road pavements. The work developed in this study also presents the influence of the type of wheel (single and dual) on pavement performance. The results of this work allowed the conclusion that the equivalent <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> factors for single wheels is approximately 10 times greater than for a dual wheel.
