5|$|The final {{modification}} to SH-34 occurred {{just under}} a month later, on February 2, 1987, when SH-34 was realigned in Elk City to follow I-40 {{instead of the}} old <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> now-dead US-66, which had become a business loop of I-40.

5|$|After {{duplication}} in 1890, {{the original}} lattice-girder Como Bridge across the Georges River was laid as gauntlet track. This arrangement remained {{in place for}} many decades, causing a notorious bottleneck on the line, until the New South Wales Government commissioned John Holland & Co {{to build a new}} bridge in 1969. Construction of the new bridge, made of prestressed concrete box girders, commenced in 1969 and was first used by the 18:17 service from Como on 19 November 1972. The old bridge, as well as a former <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line between Mortdale and Oatley replaced in 1905, is now used as a rail trail for pedestrians and cyclists.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{progressive}} alignment method called T-Coffee is {{slower than}} Clustal and its derivatives but generally produces more accurate alignments for distantly related sequence sets. T-Coffee calculates pairwise alignments {{by combining the}} direct <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pair with indirect alignments that aligns each sequence of the pair to a third sequence. It uses the output from Clustal as well as another local alignment program LALIGN, which finds multiple regions of local alignment between two sequences. The resulting alignment and phylogenetic tree are used {{as a guide to}} produce new and more accurate weighting factors.|$|E
5|$|CR101's {{southern}} segment {{begins at}} an intersection with Shelter Rock Road (CR8) and Herricks Road near Herricks High School. The route heads eastward as Searingtown Road, passing {{to the south}} of the high school and to the north of a small pond. One block east of Herricks Road, CR101 intersects with Old Searingtown Road, a former <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current CR101 alignment. At this point, the highway curves to the northeast and passes through a small area of trees nestled amongst a large, residential area bordering Williston Park. Old Searingtown Road rejoins CR101 at the northern edge of the forested area.|$|E

5|$|Cory Shankman et al. {{examined}} {{the consequences of}} a distant massive perturber on the TNOs used to infer the planet's existence. They simulated clones (objects with similar orbits) of 15 objects with semi-major axis > 150 AU and perihelion > 30 AU under the influence of a 10 Earth-massed Planet Nine in Batygin and Brown's best fit orbit. While longitude of perihelion <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> objects with semi-major axis > 250 AU was observed in their simulations, the <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arguments of perihelion was not. The simulations also revealed an increase in the inclinations of many objects, thereby predicting a larger reservoir of high-inclination TNOs. These objects should have been detected in existing surveys but are still unseen so far—suggesting there is a currently missing or unseen signature of Planet Nine. A previously published paper concluded that current observations are insufficient to identify this signature, however. The perihelia of many of the objects also rose and fell smoothly, inconsistent with the current absence of extreme TNOs with perihelia between 50 AU and 70 AU. Their perihelia also reached values where the objects would not be observed and, after declining, fell low enough for the objects to enter planet-crossing orbits leading to their ejection from the Solar System. These factors would require a population of Sednas significantly larger than current estimates, and inconsistent with current models of the early Solar System, to explain current observations. Based on these challenges Shankman et al. concluded that the existence of Planet Nine is unlikely and that the currently observed <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing TNOs is a temporary phenomenon that will disappear as more objects are detected.|$|E

5|$|In Orson, Route370 passes local {{farms and}} some houses. Shortly after it intersects with the {{northern}} terminus of Route670 (Belmont Turnpike North), which continues north as Oxbow Road. Route370 continues eastward out of Orson, passing Orson Pond and several residences in a mainly rural area before entering the hamlet of Poyntelle. In Poyntelle, the highway passes {{to the north of}} Lake Lorain and Lake Lorain Golf Course. At the intersection with Lake Lorain Road, Route370 turns to the northeast once again, paralleling Cribbs Road into downtown Poyntelle. The two roads cross a former <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ontario and Western Railroad before merging just north of Poyntelle.|$|E

5|$|New Jersey Route 163 {{originated}} as an {{alignment of}} U.S. Route 46 (co-signed with New Jersey State Highway Route 6). The alignment of 6 and 46 went along the <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original State Highway Route 5 {{from the early}} 1920s, stretching from Newark to the bridge over the Delaware River at Delaware. The route was decommissioned when the 1927 renumbering occurred. After that renumbering, the route became State Highway Route 6, a co-designation to U.S. Route 46, which had been assigned the prior year. The two highway designations remained intact until the 1953 renumbering, when Route 6 was decommissioned in favor of using the U.S. 46 designation. U.S. Route 46 was realigned once again when the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge opened in 1953, when the <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highway was changed to head along former State Highway Route 8 (mostly New Jersey Route 94), where it ended at U.S. Route 611 and NJ 94, where its current terminus is located. After the realigning of the Delaware Bridge alignment, the route was renumbered to New Jersey Route 163. Two years later, the Delaware Bridge was swept away in floods caused by Hurricane Connie and Diane in 1955, which took out several other bridges over the Delaware.|$|E
