5|$|For the Battle of Romani, Chauvel {{chose his}} ground carefully, reconnoitring {{it from the}} ground and the air, and {{selecting}} both forward and fall back positions. His luck held; the German commander— Friedrich Kreß von Kressenstein— selected the same position as the forming up area for his attack in August 1916. Under great pressure, Chauvel maintained his position until Brigadier-General Edward Chaytor's New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade arrived after being released by Lawrence. The counter-attack that Chauvel had been calling for all day did not materialise until dusk. At Katia and again at Bir el Abd, Chauvel attempted to sweep around the Turkish flank but wound up making frontal attacks on the Turkish rearguard and was beaten off by determined counter-attacks and artillery fire against the 3rd Light Horse Brigade. Despite killing 1,250 Turks and taking over 4,000 prisoners, Chauvel was criticised for his failure to rout and destroy the Turks. However, for the Australian and New Zealand horsemen, who suffered over 900 of the 1,130British casualties, it was <b>a</b> <b>clear-cut</b> victory, their first decisive win and the turning point of the campaign. Later, Chauvel realised that Romani was the first decisive British victory of the war outside West Africa Campaign.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, {{by means}} of {{examining}} the dates of various parts of Eim Habanim Semeichah, and by analyzing Teichtal's ideological stances during the various stages of his compilation, {{it becomes clear that}} the book does not present <b>a</b> <b>clear-cut</b> stand on any of the basic issues of Religious Zionism’s conceptions, as well as Orthodoxy’s beliefs. Moreover, Teichtal’s doctrines are filled with retractions and contradictions, and his positions swing from Hungarian Orthodoxy to Religious Zionist thought.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of written sources, knowledge of this period depends {{to a large degree}} on the interpretation of archaeological data. The traditional view of <b>a</b> <b>clear-cut</b> division between Frisians in the north and coast, Franks in the south and Saxons in the east has proven historically problematic. Archeological evidence suggests dramatically different models for different regions, with demographic continuity for {{some parts of the country}} and depopulation and possible replacement in other parts, notably the coastal areas of Frisia and Holland.|$|E

A condition identified as borzoi retinopathy is seen in some individuals, usually active dogs, which differs from progressive retinal atrophy in several ways. First, it is unilateral, and rarely seen in animals less than three years of age; second, <b>a</b> <b>clear-cut</b> pattern of inheritance has not been demonstrated; and finally, most affected individuals do not go blind.|$|E
40|$|Pine weevil feeding in Scots {{pine and}} Norway spruce regenerations Damage {{caused by the}} pine weevil, Hylobius abietis (L) feeding on conifer {{seedlings}} {{is a major problem}} in reforested areas in many parts of Europe. The adult weevil feeds on the stem-bark of young seedlings, frequently killing a large proportion of newly planted seedlings. The aims of the studies underlying this thesis were to investigate whether additional food supplies could decrease the damage caused by pine weevil to seedlings, and to determine whether access to extra food might explain why seedlings beneath shelter trees receive less damage from pine weevils compared to seedlings planted in <b>a</b> <b>clear-cutting.</b> <b>A</b> survey was conducted to study what effect removing shelter trees has on the level of damage pine weevils cause to seedlings.

25|$|Another Boer force {{occupied}} Elandslaagte, {{which lay}} between Ladysmith and Dundee. The British under Major General John French and Colonel Ian Hamilton attacked {{to clear the}} line of communications to Dundee. The resulting Battle of Elandslaagte was <b>a</b> <b>clear-cut</b> British tactical victory, but Sir George White feared that more Boers were about to attack his main position and so ordered a chaotic retreat from Elandslaagte, throwing away any advantage gained. The detachment from Dundee was compelled to make an exhausting cross-country retreat to rejoin White's main force.|$|E
25|$|Typically, casuistic {{reasoning}} {{begins with}} <b>a</b> <b>clear-cut</b> paradigmatic case. In legal reasoning, for example, {{this might be}} a precedent case, such as premeditated murder. From it, the casuist would ask how closely the given case currently under consideration matches the paradigmatic case. Cases like the paradigmatic case ought to be treated likewise; cases unlike the paradigm ought to be treated differently. Thus, a man is properly charged with premeditated murder if the circumstances surrounding his case closely resemble the exemplary premeditated murder case. The less a given case is like the paradigm, the weaker the justification is for treating that case like the paradigmatic case.|$|E

The best {{of them is a}} 1291 khachkar with the maker’s name carved in the bottom left star, {{which is one of the}} most {{intricate}} examples in existence. The finely carved lacy ornaments are arranged in layers in which the basic elements of the composition — a cross on a shield-shaped rosette and eight-pointed Starr filling the corners of the middle-cross section—show clearly. The intricate openwork ornaments vary — <b>a</b> <b>clear-cut</b> geometrical pattern constitutes the background, and the accentuating elements form a complicated combination of a floral and geometrical ornament which never repeats itself.|$|E

25|$|While the BCS {{routinely}} involved {{controversy about}} which two teams {{are the top}} teams, in rare instances there was <b>a</b> <b>clear-cut</b> top two; the BCS ensured these top two would play {{each other for the}} championship. For example, USC and Texas in 2005 were the only undefeated teams; both teams were only tested a couple of times all season and mauled every other opponent they faced by large margins. Had this scenario occurred before the inception of the BCS, the teams would have been unable to play each other due to contractual obligations with the major bowls and there would have been dual national champions. Under the BCS system however, these two teams got to play for the championship.|$|E
25|$|There was <b>a</b> <b>clear-cut</b> {{incision}} on the neck. It was {{six inches}} in length and commenced {{two and a half}} inches in a straight line below the angle of the jaw, one half inch in over an undivided muscle, and then becoming deeper, dividing the sheath. The cut was very clean and deviated only a little downwards. The arteries and other vessels contained in the sheath were all cut through. The cut through the tissues on the right side was more superficial, and tailed off to about two inches below the right angle of the jaw. The deep vessels on that side were uninjured. From this it was evident that the hemorrhage was caused through the partial severance of the left cartoid artery.|$|E
25|$|The War of the Second Coalition in {{northern}} Italian {{began with the}} inconclusive Battle of Verona on 26 March 1799 between the Habsburg Austrian army of Paul Kray and the Republican French Army of Italy under Barthélemy Louis Joseph Schérer. The subsequent Battle of Magnano on 5 April was <b>a</b> <b>clear-cut</b> victory by Kray over the French, with the Austrians sustaining 6,000 casualties while inflicting losses of 8,000 men and 18 guns on their foes. The defeat was a crushing blow to French morale and prompted Schérer to plead with the French Directory to be relieved of command. Finding his strong position behind the Mincio River outflanked on the north by 12,000 Austrians, Schérer left 12,000 troops to hold the key fortress of Mantua, directed 1,600 more to defend Peschiera del Garda and retreated to the west on 12 April. Two days later, Alexander Suvorov arrived at Vicenza with a Imperial Russian army and assumed command of the combined Austro-Russian forces.|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of <b>a</b> <b>clear-cutting</b> {{experiment}} of sedge areas on seasonally flooded grasslands, we described the fish community structure and the relationships between its spatial organisation and some environmental variables in early spring in 2000. A confinement gradient related {{to an increase in}} macrophyte density and determined by the nearest distance from permanent waters seemed to be a key factor in structuring the fish community in the flooded grasslands. Along this gradient, Cyprinids (essentially 0 +) dominated near permanent water bodies (95 % in abundance) but were substituted further by more tolerant species (Anguilla anguilla and Lepomis gibbosus) and mainly Ameiurus melas (age > 1, 40 % in abundance). Although most species (10 / 13) present in the main permanent channels have been found in flooded grasslands, the efficiency of these grasslands as fish habitat was low compared to other similar sites from literature. We concluded on the importance of a confinement gradient and the water regime, isolating grasslands during summer and responsible of the scarce presence of fish...|$|R
40|$|Damage {{caused by}} the pine weevil, Hylobius abietis (L) feeding on conifer {{seedlings}} {{is a major problem}} in reforested areas in many parts of Europe. The adult weevil feeds on the stem-bark of young seedlings, frequently killing a large proportion of newly planted seedlings. The aims of the studies underlying this thesis were to investigate whether additional food supplies could decrease the damage caused by pine weevil to seedlings, and to determine whether access to extra food might explain why seedlings beneath shelter trees receive less damage from pine weevils compared to seedlings planted in <b>a</b> <b>clear-cutting.</b> <b>A</b> survey was conducted to study what effect removing shelter trees has on the level of damage pine weevils cause to seedlings. Finally, the influence of factors including fertilization, establishment and soil scarification on the growth and tolerance of Norway spruce seedlings to pine weevil feeding was studied. Pine weevil damage to seedlings was significantly reduced when extra food (fresh branches of Scots pine) was regularly provided nearby. Feeding by pine weevils in the crowns of large trees occurred during a limited period following their migratory flight but {{did not seem to be}} sufficient enough to explain the lower feeding pressure observed on seedlings in shelterwoods over the entire season. During the first year after cutting, roots in the humus layer seemed to be an important food source but were utilized to similar extent in both clear-cuts and shelterwoods. Thus, findings reported provided valuable knowledge about pine weevil feeding on seedlings and other food sources but could not fully explain why seedlings planted beneath shelter trees receive less pine weevil damage compared to seedlings planted on <b>an</b> open <b>clear-cutting.</b> Before the removal of shelter trees, Norway spruce and Scots pine seedlings need to have reached diameters of 10 - 12 mm in order to avoid lethal levels of damage from pine weevil attack. Loading Norway spruce seedlings with nutrients in the autumn before plantation did not lead to more feeding from pine weevils. Treatments that postpone the start of pine weevil feeding enhanced the ability of seedlings to sustain pine weevil damage later on, probably as a result of reduced stress allowing a more rapid establishment of seedlings...|$|R
25|$|Despite intense {{research}} efforts, it has {{not been}} possible to identify <b>a</b> single <b>clear-cut</b> mechanism for development of FAS or FASD.

Clear conclusions with universal validity are difficult to draw, since different ethnic groups show considerable genetic polymorphism for the hepatic enzymes responsible for ethanol detoxification.|$|R
25|$|Genetic {{disorders}} {{may also}} be complex, multifactorial, or polygenic, meaning they are likely associated {{with the effects of}} multiple genes in combination with lifestyles and environmental factors. Multifactorial disorders include heart disease and diabetes. Although complex disorders often cluster in families, they do not have <b>a</b> <b>clear-cut</b> pattern of inheritance. This makes it difficult to determine a person’s risk of inheriting or passing on these disorders. Complex disorders are also difficult to study and treat, because the specific factors that cause most of these disorders have not yet been identified. Studies which aim to identify the cause of complex disorders can use several methodological approaches to determine genotype-phenotype associations. One method, the genotype-first approach, starts by identifying genetic variants within patients and then determining the associated clinical manifestations. This is opposed to the more traditional phenotype-first approach, and may identify causal factors that have previously been obscured by clinical heterogeneity, penetrance, and expressivity.|$|E
25|$|By the 1940s, college {{football}} conferences began signing contracts that tied their championship {{team to a}} particular bowl. In 1947, the Big Ten Conference and the Pacific Coast Conference, a forerunner of today's Pac-12 Conference, agreed to commit their champions {{to play in the}} Rose Bowl every year, an agreement that continued under the BCS. This system raised the possibility that the two top-ranked teams in the final poll would not play each other in a bowl game, even in situations when there was <b>a</b> <b>clear-cut</b> top two. Indeed, since the AP began releasing its final poll after the bowl games in 1968, the two top-ranked teams in the final regular-season AP Poll had only played each other in a bowl six times until special bowl arrangements began in 1992. Under these circumstances, it was not uncommon to have the Coaches Poll crown a different national champion than the AP Poll, resulting in a split championship. This situation arose a total of ten different seasons before BCS was formed (1954, 1957, 1965, 1970, 1973, 1974, 1978, 1990, 1991, 1997).|$|E
25|$|Residents {{may also}} choose to purchase, or rent, land from another Resident (a Resident landlord) {{rather than from}} Linden Lab. On a private region, the {{built-in}} land selling controls allow the landlord to sell land {{in the region to}} another Resident while still retaining some control. Residents purchasing, or renting, land from any other party than Linden Lab are not required to hold a Premium membership nor to necessarily pay a tier fee, although typically the landlord will require some form of upfront or monthly fee to compensate them for their liability to pay the land use fee charged by Linden Lab. However Linden Lab acknowledges only the landlord as the owner of the land, and will not intervene in disputes between Residents. This means, for example, that a landlord can withdraw a Resident's land from availability, without refunding their money, and Linden Lab will not arbitrate in the dispute unless it is <b>a</b> <b>clear-cut</b> matter of 'land fraud'. Users can report such matters to Linden Lab if they occur and they will look into it.|$|E
