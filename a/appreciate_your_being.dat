Though of course, I did find her review in the March Locus to be quite flattering.Personally, I think Victorian fantasies {{are going to be}} the next big thing, as long as we can come up with a fitting collective term for Powers, Blaylock and myself. Something based on the appropriate technology of the era; like [...] "steam-punks," [...] perhaps.... K.W. Jeter ...|$|E
