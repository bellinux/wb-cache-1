5|$|The Boeing 747 is a large, {{wide-body}} (two-aisle) airliner {{with four}} wing-mounted engines. The wings {{have a high}} sweep angle of 37.5 degrees for a fast, efficient cruise of Mach0.84 to 0.88, depending on the variant. The sweep also reduces the wingspan, allowing the 747 to use existing hangars. Seating capacity is more than 366 with a 3–4–3 seat <b>arrangement</b> (<b>a</b> cross section of 3 seats, an aisle, 4 seats, another aisle, and 3 seats) in economy class and a 2–3–2 arrangement in first class on the main deck.

5|$|The bookwheel, in {{its most}} {{commonly}} seen form, was invented by Italian military engineer Agostino Ramelli in 1588, presented {{as one of the}} 195 designs in Le diverse et artificiose machine del Capitano Agostino Ramelli (The various and ingenious machines of Captain Agostino Ramelli). To ensure that the books remained at a constant angle, Ramelli incorporated an epicyclic gearing <b>arrangement,</b> <b>a</b> complex device that had only previously been used in astronomical clocks. Ramelli's design is unnecessarily elaborate, as he likely understood that gravity could have worked just as effectively (as it does with a Ferris wheel, invented centuries later), but the gearing system allowed him to display his mathematical prowess. While other people would go on to build bookwheels based on Ramelli's design, Ramelli did not in fact ever construct his own.|$|E
5|$|Then {{followed}} around 200 {{years of}} confusion over the taxonomic {{limits of the}} species, caused by the species' great variability, similarities with closely related species, and early attempts to classify the species based on dried specimen material alone. A stable Banksia taxonomy did not begin to emerge until 1981 {{with the publication of}} Alex George's landmark monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). Over the next 18 years, George's arrangement was gradually refined in the light of new research and the discovery of new material, and there were several changes to B.integrifolias infraspecific taxa. These changes culminated in George's 1999 arrangement, which had broad acceptance until 2005, when Austin Mast, Eric Jones and Shawn Havery published a phylogeny that did not accord with George's <b>arrangement.</b> <b>A</b> new taxonomic arrangement was not published at the time, but early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring Dryandra to Banksia, and publishing B.subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B.integrifolia is placed in B.subg. Spathulatae; indeed, it is the type species for the subgenus.|$|E

25|$|The Sperrin was {{equipped}} with a tricycle undercarriage <b>arrangement</b> (<b>a</b> twin-wheel nosewheel {{and a pair of}} four-wheel bogies), in which the nose gear would retract backward and the main gear into the wings towards the fuselage. A safety circuit was present to prevent retraction of the landing gear until a sufficient air speed had been attained. Unusually, the landing gear was steerable, the Sperrin being one of the first British aircraft to be fitted with this feature; operation of the landing gear, along with various other pieces of onboard equipment, was achieved via the onboard Messier hydraulic system. A 24/28-volt DC electrical network was present to power onboard equipment; both of the electrical generators as well as the air pressure of the cabin was maintained by a supercharger driven by two accessory gearboxes that were housed within the wings.|$|E

25|$|Hødd was {{established}} on 1 August 1919 and the club's first {{task was to}} find a suitable location to play football games. As a temporary <b>arrangement,</b> <b>a</b> football field was rented for the inaugural season for NOK400. The first location which was considered was to purchase land at Holsekerdalen, but a clause in the contract resulted in 15 of 17 members voted against the purchase at a member meeting on 25 September. Instead the club landed on Høddvoll, which was partitioned out of the farm Støylane and approved by the members on 13 February 1920. The main advantage of Høddvoll over Holsekerdalen was that the former allowed for a future expansion of the facilities. The club borrowed 3,000 Norwegian krone (NOK), which was guaranteed by all adult members and some supporters. Construction stated the same year and by March 1921 NOK8,800 had been invested in the venue. Financing was aided by a grant of NOK2,000 from the Football Association of Norway (NFF). The venue opened that year, initially with a gravel pitch.|$|E
