5|$|In {{addition}} to its commercial success, Kalidas was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>breakthrough</b> for Rajalakshmi's career, and made her a bankable singing star. Because no print, gramophone record, or songbook {{of the film is}} known to survive, it is a lost film.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>breakthrough</b> came in 1984, when English Heritage and the National Heritage Memorial Fund {{granted a}} million pounds towards the restoration, with smaller sums from Woodspring District Council and other funding bodies. The trust, {{which had been}} formed by the {{preservation}} society, also obtained a 99-year lease. The pier was dismantled in 1985, taken to Portishead dock for restoration, and reconstructed in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Although Rand {{had some}} {{mainstream}} success previously with her play Night of January 16th {{and had two}} previously published novels, The Fountainhead was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>breakthrough</b> in her career. It brought her lasting fame and financial success. She sold the movie rights to The Fountainhead and returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay for the adaptation. In April 1944, she signed a multiyear contract with movie producer Hal Wallis to write original screenplays and adaptations of other writers' works.|$|E

5|$|Devadasu was {{released}} on 26June 1953, and the Tamil version {{was released}} three months later, on 11September 1953. Both versions were critically and commercially successful. It has since achieved cult status, with terms and phrases from the film being widely cited. Both versions proved to be <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>breakthrough</b> in Nageswara Rao's career, although they also led to him being typecast in similar roles.|$|E
5|$|Nigeria was {{the only}} country in Africa to have never {{eradicated}} polio, which it periodically exported to other African countries; Polio was cut 98% between 2009 and 2010. However, <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>breakthrough</b> came in December 2014, when it was reported that Nigeria hadn't recorded a polio case in 6 months, and {{was on its way to}} being declared Polio free.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to the HDF, {{the ongoing}} US-Venezuela Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Project {{was started in}} 1979, and {{reported}} <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>breakthrough</b> in 1983 {{with the discovery of}} the approximate location of a causal gene. This was the result of an extensive study focusing on the populations of two isolated Venezuelan villages, Barranquitas and Lagunetas, where there was an unusually high prevalence of the disease. It involved over 18,000 people—mostly from a single extended family.|$|E
50|$|The Compucolor was {{an early}} color home {{computer}} product introduced in 1976 by Compucolor Corporation of Norcross, Georgia. It was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> product <b>breakthrough</b> in color graphics, text, and storage.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>major</b> {{technical}} <b>breakthrough</b> came in 1830, when balls made of gutta-percha, {{an early}} form of rubber, were introduced. These balls were larger still, the gutta-percha softer and less resilient than the rubber of today. They {{were used in}} addition to the wool-and-leather balls, rather than replacing them.|$|R
50|$|Lloyd Cleworth Stinson (February 29, 1904 - August 28, 1976) was a {{politician}} in Manitoba, Canada, {{and the leader}} of that province's Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) from 1953 to 1959. Although widely regarded as a capable leader, he was unable to achieve <b>a</b> <b>major</b> electoral <b>breakthrough</b> for his party.|$|R
5|$|The Haber-Bosch {{method for}} synthesizing {{ammonium}} nitrate represented <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>breakthrough</b> and allowed crop yields to overcome previous constraints. It was first patented by German chemist Fritz Haber. In 1910 Carl Bosch, {{while working for}} German chemical company BASF, successfully commercialized the process and secured further patents. In the years after World War II, the use of synthetic fertilizer increased rapidly, {{in sync with the}} increasing world population.|$|E
5|$|Critics praised System Shock and hailed it as <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>breakthrough</b> in its genre. It {{was later}} placed on {{multiple}} {{hall of fame}} lists. The game was a moderate commercial success, with sales exceeding 170,000 copies, but Looking Glass ultimately lost money on the project. A sequel, System Shock 2, was released by Looking Glass Studios and offshoot developer Irrational Games in 1999. The 2000 game Deus Ex (also produced by Spector) and the 2007 game BioShock are spiritual successors to the two games. A remade version of the original game by Night Dive Studios is scheduled for release in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Mouna Ragam was {{released}} on 15 August 1986, India's Independence Day. Despite a modest beginning, it became a box-office success, and <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>breakthrough</b> in Ratnam's career. The critically acclaimed film received the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil, and Ratnam received the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Director. Mouna Ragam was later dubbed in Telugu with the same title, and was remade in Hindi in 1992 as Kasak with Rishi Kapoor and Neelam Kothari in the lead roles.|$|E
50|$|On May 7, 2009, {{the company}} {{announced}} <b>a</b> <b>major</b> technological <b>breakthrough</b> {{in the field of}} consolidated bioprocessing by utilizing a low-cost strategy for processing of biofuels from cellulosic biomass, which enables high yield of ethanol and cellulase in single step without the costly, separate usage of the cellulase enzyme.|$|R
50|$|A {{cantilever}} bridge is a bridge built using cantilevers, structures that project horizontally into space, supported {{on only one}} end. The steel truss {{cantilever bridge}} was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> engineering <b>breakthrough</b> since it can span distances of over 1,500 ft. The AJX bridge is the only surviving cantilevered deck truss bridge in Wyoming.|$|R
50|$|After {{touring the}} UK for a year, basing {{themselves}} initially in Hawick, Scotland with Muir and travelling relentlessly, the band {{appeared to be}} on the brink of <b>a</b> <b>major</b> commercial <b>breakthrough.</b> They were feted by Eric Clapton and Elvis Costello and Madonna asked them to be her support act at Wembley Stadium in 1987.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{construction}} of the Berlin Wall beginning in 1961, which increased tensions between East and West, Brundage was successful in securing a joint German team for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Nevertheless, the East Germans, supported by IOC members from Warsaw Pact nations, aspired to have their own team. They made <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>breakthrough</b> when the IAAF (led by the Marquess of Exeter, the former Lord Burghley) recognized a separate East German team beginning with the 1966 European Athletics Championships. The East Germans did their best to get Brundage's support, and, at the IOC session at Mexico City in 1968, they were granted full membership, with their own team under their own flag, which they displayed on West German soil four years later at the Opening Ceremony at Munich. Brundage, while finally supporting full membership for East Germany, considered the matter a defeat for Olympic ideals.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of the Lakers, the 1970s were {{characterized}} by <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>breakthrough</b> of the league's western franchises. In 1975, after compiling a 48–34 regular-season record, the Golden State Warriors swept the heavily favored Washington Bullets 4–0 in the 1975 NBA Finals. In 1976, the Phoenix Suns, who only enjoyed eight years of existence as a franchise, overcame a losing record early in the season to build a remarkable win streak to finish 42–40. The events culminated in upset victories over the Seattle SuperSonics and the Warriors, before facing Boston in the Finals. The teams split the first four games, before Game 5 went into three overtimes before Boston won 128–126. The Celtics managed to secure their 13th championship quickly after, defeating the Suns 87–80 in Game 6.|$|E
5|$|Kluge {{welcomed the}} decision, {{as he was}} already in the process of {{withdrawing}} units of the 9th Army from the northern side of the Kursk salient to deal with Soviet attacks on his flank. But Manstein was greatly disappointed. He argued that his forces were now on the verge of achieving <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>breakthrough</b> on the southern side of the salient. As he saw it, with his III Panzer Corps about to link up with the II SS-Panzer Corps at Prokhorovka, and with the XXIV Panzer Corps available as his operational reserve, they would be halting the offensive just at the moment when victory was in hand. With an eye toward the west, Hitler was unwilling to continue the offensive. Manstein persisted, proposing that his forces should at least destroy the Soviet reserves in the southern Kursk salient before Citadel was finally terminated, so that the Soviet fighting capacity in the sector would be depleted {{for the rest of the}} summer. Hitler agreed to continue offensive operations in the southern salient until Manstein's goal was achieved.|$|E
50|$|There {{was a minor}} setback in 1987 when a {{few members}} on {{the left of the}} party broke away to {{establish}} a Scottish Socialist Party (not the same one that is in existence now) but in the long-run this small party did not establish itself and it folded without threatening to make <b>a</b> <b>major</b> electoral <b>breakthrough.</b>|$|R
50|$|Jakarta is {{the capital}} city of Indonesia, {{harboring}} over 9 million inhabitants. It is estimated that over four million residents of the surrounding Jabodetabek area commute to and from the city each working day. Transport issues have increasingly begun to attract political attention and it has been foreseen that without <b>a</b> <b>major</b> transportation <b>breakthrough,</b> the city will have complete traffic gridlock by 2020.|$|R
50|$|This {{method was}} used to observe the charge delocalization in the organic salt (EDO-TTF)2PF6 as it {{undergoes}} a photo-induced insulator-to-metal phase transition. The motion observed revealed the reduction in dimensionality that takes place at transitional moments in chemical reactions, which is <b>a</b> <b>major</b> theoretical <b>breakthrough</b> in understanding how there can be repeated patterns in chemistry among molecules of vastly different dimensions.|$|R
5|$|The {{university}} operates six {{research centres}} and institutes, the Centre for Neuroscience Studies, GeoEngeering Centre, High Performance Computing Virtual Laboratory, Human Mobility Research Centre, Sudbury Neutrino Observatory Institute, and the Southern African Research Centre. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory's director, Arthur B. McDonald, {{is a member}} of the university's physics department. The observatory managed the SNO experiment, which demonstrated that the solution to the solar neutrino problem was that neutrinos change flavour (type) as they propagate through the Sun. The SNO experiment proved that a non-zero mass neutrino exists. This was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>breakthrough</b> in cosmology. In October 2015, Arthur B. McDonald and Takaaki Kajita (University of Tokyo) jointly received the Nobel Prize in Physics for illustration of neutrino change identities and identification of mass. This is the first Nobel Prize awarded to a Queen's University researcher. In 1976 urologist Alvaro Morales, along with his colleagues, developed the first clinically effective immunotherapy for cancer by adapting the Bacille Calmette-Guérin tuberculosis vaccine for treatment of early stage bladder cancer.|$|E
25|$|Researchers at Queen Mary, University of London, report <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>breakthrough</b> in {{treating}} advanced bladder cancer.|$|E

2500|$|In March 1921, the GNA {{representatives in}} Moscow signed the [...] "Friendship and Brotherhood" [...] Treaty with Soviet Russia, which was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> {{diplomatic}} <b>breakthrough</b> for the Kemalists. The Treaty of Moscow, {{followed by the}} identical Treaty of Kars in October the same year, gave Turkey a favourable settlement of its north-eastern frontier at the expense the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, then nominally an independent state.|$|R
5000|$|For 2 Horatio Street, Bing & Bing chose {{architect}} Robert T. Lyons, {{who they}} had just worked with on the Gramercy Park Hotel, which had opened in 1925. The Bing brothers and Lyons also partnered on what was then <b>a</b> <b>major</b> technological <b>breakthrough</b> [...] - [...] creating the world's tallest apartment building [...] - [...] 17 stories [...] - [...] at 903 Park Avenue, which was completed in 1916.|$|R
5000|$|On March 14, 1956, The Ampex VRX-1000 (later {{renamed the}} Mark IV) {{videotape}} recorder is introduced at the National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters in Chicago. This {{is the first}} practical videotape recorder and is hailed as <b>a</b> <b>major</b> technological <b>breakthrough.</b> CBS goes on air with the first videotape delayed broadcast, Douglas Edwards and The News, on November 30, 1956, from Los Angeles, California, using the Ampex Mark IV.|$|R
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>breakthrough</b> in bridge {{technology}} {{came with the}} erection of the Iron Bridge in Shropshire, England in 1779. It used cast iron {{for the first time}} as arches to cross the river Severn.|$|E
25|$|On 2 November 2009, P. C. George {{faction of}} the Kerala Congress decided to merge with Kerala Congress (M). This was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>breakthrough</b> in the Kerala {{politics}} since George abused and criticised Mani for many years.|$|E
25|$|The 2005 general {{election}} was considered <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>breakthrough</b> by the BNP, as {{they picked up}} 192,746 votes in the 119 constituencies it contested, took a 0.7% share of the overall vote, and retained a deposit in 40 of the seats.|$|E
5000|$|In 1984, the {{construction}} of <b>a</b> <b>major</b> lubricating oil manufacturing plant increased Richmond's lube oil base-stock output from 3,800 to [...] a day, using hydrocracking and hydrorefining processes developed by Chevron Research. Later, in 1993, <b>a</b> <b>major</b> research <b>breakthrough</b> occurred when Chevron introduced Isodewaxing technology. This new technique maximized the production of high quality base oils while co-producing high-value light products and allowed for the economical production of base oils that meet specifications calling for lighter-viscosity lubricant grades.|$|R
30|$|The {{rise of the}} two Asian giants China and India {{has altered}} the geopolitical {{equations}} considerably. Concerted action between India and China will help to stabilise and steer the world from potential conflicts. <b>A</b> <b>major</b> shift from Deng Xiaoping’s policy of lying low occurred as Jiang Zemin started to enter the international community in the mid 1990 s (Xuanli Liao 2006). Jiang Zemin’s 1996 visit to India was <b>an</b> <b>major</b> <b>breakthrough</b> in bilateral {{relations between the two}} nations. China will exert its strength in a phased manner, beginning with the careful cultivation of allies followed by the gradual edging out of its competitors. China is not ready to directly confront America, nor it is willing to sacrifice its trading interests. A fine balance must be sought between the two options via a form of realpolitik. Political analysts are of the opinion that China’s intentions are to test America’s patience by enticing their allies to shift positions. The strategy of isolating of each other’s allies is apparent in China’s moves to lure Eastern European allies and America’s renewed focus on the Pacific theatre.|$|R
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{organoid}} model is <b>a</b> <b>major</b> technological <b>breakthrough</b> {{that has already}} been established as an essential tool in many basic biology and clinical applications.
