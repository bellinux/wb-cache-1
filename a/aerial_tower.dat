5|$|The {{telescope}} was constructed {{so that the}} bowl could be completely inverted. Originally, {{it was intended to}} use a movable tower {{at the base of the}} telescope to change the receivers at the focus. However, the movable tower was never built, due jointly to funding constraints and the fact that much of the receiver equipment was placed at the base of the telescope rather than at the focus. Instead, receivers were mounted on 50-foot (15-m) long steel tubes, which were then inserted by a winch into the top of the <b>aerial</b> <b>tower</b> while the bowl was inverted. The cables from the receivers then ran down the inside of this tube, which could then be connected when the {{telescope was}} pointed at the zenith. Associated receiver equipment could then be placed either in the small, swinging laboratory directly underneath the surface; in rooms at the tops of the two towers; at the base girders, or in the control building.|$|E

5000|$|Boston Fire Department {{purchased}} some of {{the first}} modern Sutphen tower ladders in 1970. The first was a 75-foot model which replaced Ladder 3 as <b>Aerial</b> <b>Tower</b> 1 and the second was an 85-foot model which replaced Ladder 26 as <b>Aerial</b> <b>Tower</b> 2. The vehicles were moved around the city as needed. After both aerial units were disbanded in the early 1980s, the second unit re-emerged in 1983 as Boston Fire Department's Tower Unit and served until replacement in 1985. [...] In the late 1970s Sutphen built engine bodies on Ford and GMC chassis for the department. In the early 1980s full Sutphen engines were bought including at least one with a shorter aerial device.|$|E
50|$|The {{radar station}} at Mine Camp {{was built by}} the Allied Works Council to monitor enemy {{airborne}} threats during World War II.

50|$|The {{building}} was largely empty {{the afternoon of}} Saturday June 17, 1972, save for a few people performing renovations. One of the workers discovered that a fire had begun in an enclosed space between {{the third and fourth}} floors, and at 2:35 PM rang Box 1571. A working fire was called in at 2:44 PM, and subsequent alarms were rung at 2:46 PM, 3:02 PM, and 3:06 PM. A total of 16 engine companies, five ladder companies, two <b>aerial</b> <b>towers,</b> and a heavy rescue company responded.|$|R
50|$|ACO Radar Nine British ACO radar {{stations}} were installed in Australia in 1943, although the original {{intention was to}} erect 32 TRUs (Transportable Radar Unit) - a similar unit which differed {{in the type of}} <b>aerial</b> <b>towers.</b> However, the British government decided to terminate the Australian contract for the provision of TRUs so that these sets could be used in Africa. Instead Australia was supplied with nine ACO units. This meant that the RAAF had to provide timber for the fixed 40.2 metre (132 foot) towers, instead of the collapsible and transportable ones used in the TRU. The result was long delays in the erection of some ACO stations.|$|R

50|$|Kvitsøy Tower is {{the name}} for the <b>aerial</b> <b>tower</b> of the 1200 {{kilowatt}} transmitter of the broadcasting company of Norway for the frequency 1314 kHz, which was built in 1981/82. Kvitsøy-Tower was a 117.5 metres high, free standing centre-fed half-wave antenna constructed of a grounded steel framework. Horizontal crossbars are located at its top and at a height of 67.5 metres above ground to support the cables for a medium wave aerial, which are strung parallel to the tower.

5000|$|Sunshine Radio was {{the first}} of the {{so-called}} Super Pirate radio stations in the Republic of Ireland and commenced broadcasting on September 9, 1980 from studios in the Sands Hotel, Portmarnock, County Dublin. It was the longest operating of the major stations. Sunshine closed at the end of 1988 having achieved the highest ratings of any Dublin radio station to this day. Their head office was in JWT House in Baggot Street in the heart of the city's commercial district. Sunshine Radio was set up by former Radio Caroline men Chris Cary, Robbie Robinson, aka Robbie Dale, and ex-BBC broadcast engineer Jimmy White with some financial support from one of Radio Caroline's partners Phil Solomon. Shortly after making its first test transmissions the stations main <b>aerial</b> <b>tower</b> was vandalised and subsequently collapsed. Cary and Solomon backed out of the venture and sold to Dale only weeks after the station opened. Sunshine Radio started on 531 kHz (announced as 539 metres) medium wave, adding an FM service a year later. Chris Cary went on to start Radio Nova in the following year, 1981, with studios in Herbert Street, Dublin. Nova {{was the first}} major Irish pirate to commence with FM, on 88.1 MHz (it ended up on 102.7 MHz). The station added an AM frequency at a later stage which varied between 819 kHz, 828 kHz 846 kHz and 738 kHz. After the success of Radio Nova on FM, Robbie Robinson broadcast Sunshine at high power on 101 MHz, and renamed the station Sunshine 101. Nova ran until 1986 when Chris Cary closed the station following a dispute with the National Union of Journalists. Other stations came on air like Q102 some claiming a Cary connection like NRG 103 (some thought that [...] "NRG" [...] was an abbreviation for [...] "Nova Radio Group"), but the name sounded like Energy 103 and Power FM, but none were able to come near to the Nova or Sunshine success. Sunshine 101 dominated the Dublin radio market until it closed down at the end of December 1988 in compliance with the new Broadcasting & Wireless Telegraphy act, which had come into effect at midnight on December 31 that year. Many of the present day stars of Irish broadcasting are proud to acknowledge their early days as part of the teams to come out of Sunshine and Nova.|$|E
