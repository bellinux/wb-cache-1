In the current study, these shortcomings are solved by defining <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> as the ratio of <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> footprint to <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> availability – where the latter is taken as natural runoff minus environmental flow requirement – and by estimating all underlying variables on a monthly basis. In this study we make {{for the first time}} a global estimate of the <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> footprint of humanity at a high spatial resolution level (a five by five arc minute grid) on a monthly basis. In order to estimate <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> at river basin level, we aggregated the computed monthly <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> footprints at grid cell level to monthly <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> footprints at river basin level. By comparing the estimates of the monthly <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> footprint with estimates of the monthly <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> availability at river basin level, we assess the intra-annual variability of <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> for the world’s major river basins. Monthly <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> footprints were estimated based on Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2011 a). Natural runoff per river basin was estimated by adding estimates of actual runoff from Fekete et al. (2002) and estimates of water volumes already consumed. Environmental flow requirements were estimated based on the presumptive standard for environmental flow protection as proposed by Richter et al. (2011), which can be regarded as a precautionary estimate of environmental flow requirements. Within the study period 1996 - 2005, in 223 river basins (55 % of the basins studied) with in total 2. 72 billion inhabitants (69 % of the total population living in the basins included in this study), the <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> level exceeded one hundred per cent during at least one month of the year, which means that environmental flow requirements were violated during at least one month of the year. In 201 river basins with in total 2. 67 billion people there was severe <b>water</b> <b>scarcity,</b> which means that the <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> footprint was more than twice the <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> availability, during at least one month per year. Global average <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> – estimated by averaging the <b>annual</b> average monthly <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> values per river basin weighted by basin area – is 85 %. This is the average <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> over the year within the total land area considered in this study. When we weight the <b>annual</b> average monthly <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> values per river basin according to population number per basin, global average <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> is 133 %. This is the average scarcity as experienced by the people in the world. This population-weighted average scarcity is higher than the area-weighted <b>scarcity</b> because the <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> values in densely populated areas – which are often higher than in sparsely populated areas – get more weight. Yet another way of expressing <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> is to take the perspective of the average water consumer. The global water consumption pattern is different from the population density pattern, because intensive water consumption in agriculture is not specifically related to where most people live. If we estimate global <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> by averaging monthly <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> values per river basin weighted based on the <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> footprint in the respective month and basin, we calculate a global <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> at 244 %. This means that the average <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> consumer in the world experiences a <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> of 244 %, i. e. operates in a month in a basin in which the <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> footprint is 2. 44 times the <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> availability and in which presumptive environmental flow requirements are thus strongly violated. The data presented in this report should be taken with care. The quality of the presented <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> data depends on the quality of the underlying data. The estimates of both monthly <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> footprint and monthly <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> availability per river basin can easily contain an error of ± 20 per cent, but a solid basis for making a precise error statement is lacking. This obviously needs additional research. Furthermore, improvements in the estimates can be made by including the effect of dams on the <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> availability over time, by accounting for inter-basin water transfers, by distinguishing between surface water, renewable groundwater and fossil groundwater, by improving estimates of environmental flow requirements, by looking at <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> at the level of sub-basins, and by considering inter-annual variability as well. Despite this great room for improvement and bringing in more detail, the current study is a milestone in global <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> studies by mapping <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> for the first time on a monthly basi...|$|R

Growing biomass for biofuels requires water, a scarce resource. Existing scenarios on freshwater use usually consider changes in food and livestock production, and industrial and domestic activities. This research assesses global water use changes related to increasing biofuel use for road transport in 2030 and evaluates the potential contribution to <b>water</b> <b>scarcity.</b> To investigate <b>water</b> demand changes related to a transition to biofuels in road transport, the study combines data from water footprint (WF) analyses with information from the IEA APS energy scenario for 2030. It includes first-generation biofuels, bio-ethanol from sugar cane, sugar beet, sweet sorghum, wheat and maize, and biodiesel from soybean, rapeseed, jatropha and oil palm. Under the IEA APS scenario, the global biofuel WF will increase more than tenfold in the period 2005 – 2030. The USA, China and Brazil together will contribute half of the global biofuel WF.

Results show that the average overall green (from rainfall) and blue (from irrigation) WFs of crops in the period 2001 – 2009 were 14 % and 37 % larger, respectively, than in the period 1961 – 1970. The annual nitrogen- and phosphorus-related grey WFs (water required to assimilate pollutants) of crop production grew by factors of 24 and 36, respectively. The green–blue WF per ton of crop reduced significantly due to improved crop yields, while the grey WF increased because of the growing application of fertilizers. The ratio of blue to green WF increased {{during the study period}} resulting from the expansion of irrigated agriculture.

Quantitative assessment of the green, <b>blue</b> and grey <b>water</b> footprint of global production and consumption can be regarded as a key in understanding the pressure put on the global freshwater resources. The overall objective of this thesis is, therefore, to analyse the spatial and temporal pattern of the water footprint of humans from both a production perspective and a consumption perspective.

The objective of the thesis is to evaluate past, current and future water footprints (WFs), <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> and virtual <b>water</b> (VW) flows at both river basin and national level in China, focusing on the agricultural sector, high spatial resolution modelling, uncertainties, inter- and intra-annual variation and benchmarks. A case study for the Yellow River Basin (YRB) for 1996 - 2005 show that uncertainties in key input variables together generate an uncertainty of ± 30 % (at 95 % confidence interval) in the estimated WFs of crops. The inter- and intra- annual variation of WF of crops and <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> in the Yellow River Basin over 1961 - 2009, as well as the inter-annual variability of crop-related green and blue WFs and inter-regional virtual water (VW) trade in China over 1978 - 2008 were simulated. The green-blue WF per tonne of crop reduced significantly due to improved crop yields over past five decades, while the grey WF increased dramatically because of the growing application of fertilizers. On average, the YRB faced moderate to severe <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> during seven months (January-July) per year. Historically, the net VW flow within China was from the water-rich South to the water-scarce North, but intensifying North-to-South crop trade reversed the net VW flow since 2000. On average, 35 % of the crop-related WF of a Chinese consumer was outside its own province. The thesis further investigated the green and blue WFs and VW trade in China under alternative scenarios for 2050 focusing on the agricultural sector. The results show that Changing to a less-meat diet can generate a reduction in the WF of food consumption of 44 % by 2050 as compared to 2005. Finally, based on a case study for winter wheat in China (1961 - 2008), it is found that when determining benchmark levels for the consumptive WF of a crop, it is most useful to distinguish between different climate zones...|$|R

Understanding dynamics of water supply and demand is the key for sustainable planning and management of watersheds. Here we analyzed the uncertainties in water supply of Alberta by building an agro-hydrological model, which accounts for major hydrological features, geo-spatial heterogeneity, and conflicts over water-food-energy resources. We examined the cumulative effects of natural features (e. g., potholes, glaciers, climate, soil, vegetation), anthropogenic factors (e. g., dams, irrigation, industrial development), environmental flow requirements (EFR), and calibration schemes on <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> in the dynamics of <b>blue</b> and green <b>water</b> resources, and groundwater recharge.

In this study, we developed a mathematical relationship between water content, and energy content of many crops and animal products by using an improved LCA approach (water footprint). The standard values of the water and energy contents of crops and animal products were obtained from the databases of Agricultural Research Service, UNESCO Institute for water education and Food, and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The water footprint approach was applied to analyze the relationship between water requirement and energy of content of crop and animal products, in which the uncertainty and sensitivity was evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation technique that is contained in the Oracle Crystal Ball Fusion Edition v 11. 1. 1. 3. 00. The results revealed significant water saving due to changes in food consumption pattern i. e. from consumption of more meat to vegetables. The production of 1 kcal of crop and animal products requires about 98 % of green, 4. 8 % <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> and 0. 4 % of gray water.

40|$|The problem Various {{studies show}} that the {{developing}} world experiences and will continue to experience a rise in consumption of animal proteins, particularly in cities, as a result of continued urbanization and income growth. Given the relatively large water footprint (WF) of animal products, this trend is likely to increase the pressure on already scarce water resources. Aim We estimate, analyse and interpret the changes in consumption of meat and milk between the 1980 s and 2000 s for three income classes in Nairobi, the ratio of domestic production to imports, and the WF (the volume of freshwater consumed) to produce these commodities in Kenya and abroad. Results Nairobi's middle-income class grew much faster than the overall population. In addition, milk consumption per capita by the middle-income group grew faster than for the city's population as a whole. Contrary to expectation, average meat consumption per capita across all income groups in Nairobi declined by 11 %. Nevertheless, total meat consumption increased by a factor 2. 2 as a result of population growth, while total milk consumption grew by a factor 5. As a result, the total WF of meat consumption increased by a factor 2. 3 and the total WF of milk consumption by a factor 4. 2. The increase in milk consumption was met by increased domestic production, whereas the growth in meat consumption was partly met through imports and an enlargement of the footprint in the countries neighbouring Kenya. Discussion and conclusion A likely future rise in the consumption of meat and milk in Nairobi will further enlarge the city's WF. Given Kenya's looming <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity,</b> it is anticipated that this WF will increasingly spill over the borders of the country. Accordingly, policies aimed at meeting the rise in demand for meat and milk should consider the associated environmental constraints and the economic implications both nationally and internationall...|$|R
40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>scarcity</b> is {{a growing}} issue of concern across the globe. In recent times a complex suite of water {{footprint}} impact assessment tools and concepts have supplemented traditional management approaches. There are several methods proposed in the literature to both quantify water use and assess its environmental impacts at defined spatial scales. In New Zealand, case studies in the water footprinting space are sparse, and are for the majority focused on the agricultural industry. This thesis focused on evaluation of different water footprint methods and their associated <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> indicators to assess water use impacts for the building and construction sector of New Zealand. The water footprints of 1 m³ ready mix concrete manufactured at 27 concrete batching plants throughout New Zealand were calculated at three distinct spatial scales: the freshwater management zone scale, catchment scale, and regional scale. Four water footprint characterisation factors (<b>blue</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> (WSblue) (Hoekstra et al., 2011), water stress index (WSI) (Pfister et al., 2009), water depletion index (WDI) (Berger et al., 2014), and available water minus demand (AMD) (Boulay et al., 2016)) {{were used to assess}} the environmental impact of water use for 1 m³ ready mix concrete at the three spatial scales. The average volumetric <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> footprint of the 27 ready mix batching plants was quantified at 0. 18 m 3 (180 litres) of water per m³ of concrete, and ranged from 0. 15 (150 litres) to 0. 29 m³ (290 litres) of freshwater per m³ of concrete. For three of the four water footprint methods used (WDI, WSI and WSblue), and across the three spatial, the Ashburton boundary ranked highest in terms of the environmental impacts of a specified quantity of water use. In contrast, the AMD method ranked the Palmerston North boundary highest across the three spatial scales. At the freshwater management zone and catchment scales, the WDI, WSI and WSblue methods ranked the Wanganui area lowest, and the AMD method ranked the Greymouth area lowest. At the regional scale, all the four water footprint methods ranked the West Coast region lowest in terms of the environmental impact of water use, due mainly {{to the fact that the}} West Coast has more available water and a lower allocation demand than other regions studied. The analysis indicated that volumetric water use varied by a factor of two across the different plants (per m 3 concrete). For three of the four WF methods (WDI, WSI and WSblue), the WF results were similar in their rankings of the different plants at all the geographical scales; however, the AMD method resulted in different rankings at all the geographical scales. Overall, the WDI and WSI <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> indices calculated by Berger et al. (2014) and Pfister et al. (2009) were less readily adaptable to the finer resolution in New Zealand. The WSblue and AMD calculated by Hoekstra et al. (2011) and Boulay et al. (2016) however, were found to be more readily adaptable. It is recommended that these methods be explored further with respect to their potential use at the finer resolution in New Zealand...|$|R

This study investigates the sensitivity of and uncertainty in crop water footprint (in m 3 t − 1) estimates related to uncertainties in important input variables. The study focuses on the green (from rainfall) and <b>blue</b> (from irrigation) <b>water</b> footprint of producing maize, soybean, rice, and wheat at the scale of the Yellow River basin in the period 1996 – 2005. A grid-based daily water balance model at a 5 by 5 arcmin resolution was applied to compute green and <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> footprints of the four crops in the Yellow River basin in the period considered. The one-at-a-time method was carried out to analyse the sensitivity of the crop water footprint to fractional changes of seven individual input variables and parameters: precipitation (PR), reference evapotranspiration (ET 0), crop coefficient (K c), crop calendar (planting date with constant growing degree days), soil water content at field capacity (S max), yield response factor (K y) and maximum yield (Y m). Uncertainties in crop water footprint estimates related to uncertainties in four key input variables: PR, ET 0, K c, and crop calendar were quantified through Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that the sensitivities and uncertainties differ across crop types. In general, the water footprint of crops is most sensitive to ET 0 and K c, followed by the crop calendar. <b>Blue</b> <b>water</b> footprints were more sensitive to input variability than green water footprints.

At national level, tomatoes and potatoes were the main crops with relatively high economic water productivity, while olives and barley were the main crops with relatively low productivity. In terms of economic land productivity, oranges had the highest productivity and barley the lowest. South Tunisia had the lowest economic water and land productivities. Economic land productivity was found to explain more of the current production patterns than economic water productivity, which may imply opportunities for water saving.

This study provides a first assessment of continuous sub-national trajectories of <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> consumption, renewable freshwater availability, and <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> for the entire 20 th century. <b>Water</b> <b>scarcity</b> is analysed using the fundamental concepts of shortage (impacts due to low availability per capita) and stress (impacts due to high consumption relative to availability) which indicate difficulties in satisfying the needs of a population and overuse of resources respectively.

This paper presents two case studies of applying the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Water Footprint (WF) approaches to tea and margarine. The WF, excluding grey water, of a carton of 50 g tea is 294 L green water and 10 L <b>blue</b> <b>water,</b> and that of a 500 g tub of margarine is 553 L green <b>water,</b> 109 L <b>blue</b> <b>water.</b> The inventory results in the LCA studies (<b>blue</b> <b>water)</b> are 13 L for tea and 114 L for margarine. In the impact assessment phase of WF, Coonoor in Southern India appears as a potential hotspot for tea production, although the water consumed in energy to boil the kettle and by the consumer are also significant. For margarine the main potential hotspot is irrigated sunflower around Zaporizhia in Ukraine. The impact assessment results of LCA for tea causes {{the water in the}} consumer use phase to be down-weighted and stresses the contribution from Coonoor due to the higher <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> of this region. Similarly the LCA impact assessment of margarine causes the palm oil contribution to be down-weighted due to the low <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> of Medan in Indonesia. From these case studies we identify similarities, differences and synergies at both the water {{accounting and}} impact assessment levels for both approaches with the purpose of improving and advancing the water resource assessment process...|$|R

40|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>water</b> (i. e. river discharge) {{and green}} water (i. e. soil water) are vital water {{resources}} to our society. Yet, assessments of <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> or <b>water</b> stress {{tend to focus}} on <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> only. This study assessed the amount of pressure put on both <b>blue</b> and green <b>water</b> resources by using the <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> index. Monthly <b>water</b> demand for the year 2000 was estimated as a bench mark year and contrasted against 44 years (duration: 1958 - 2001) of a long-term climate based on ERA- 40 and CRU TS 2. 1 meteorological data sets. The results indicate that 1. 5 to 2. 3 billion people (approximately one-third of the world's population) are currently experiencing moderate to high water stress on a global scale. The results vary significantly depending on a temporal resolution (i. e. yearly or monthly time scale). Emerging high water stress regions where green water demand is exceeding green water availability are identified for the first time. In addition, this study reveals new dimension of water stress by using a finer temporal scale than previous studies (i. e. month). Our results indicate that the degrees of <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> stress are underestimated by existing annual assessments in large regions (e. g. Sub-Sahara, the eastern part of Brazil, the western part of Australia, Central Asia and India). The regions vulnerable to the spatiotemporal variability of <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> stress are identified. Also, the monthly time steps enable to assess the seasonality and the severity of global water stress. The severity is quantified by using statistics of persistence, recurrence, average intensity as well as the dynamic water stress developed by Porporato et al. (2001). The results show that <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> stress estimated by this study generally corresponds well to the observation of past water shortage (i. e. extreme events) in the Netherlands and Japan. Even though estimated water demand of the year 2000 stays constant for 44 years, water stress (thus water shortage) was well reproduced by a long-term climate variability...|$|R

It typically entails the use of fertilizers, new cultivars, irrigation, and other modern technology. In {{regions of the world}} affected by seasonal or chronic <b>water</b> <b>scarcity,</b> yield gap closure is strongly dependent on irrigation (<b>blue</b> <b>water).</b> Global yield gap assessments have often ignored whether the water required to close the yield gap is locally available.

We find that, to close the yield gap, human appropriation of freshwater resources for irrigation would have to increase at least by 146 %. Most study countries would experience at least a doubling in <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> requirement, with 71 % of the additional <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> being required by only four crops – maize, rice, soybeans, and wheat.

40|$|AbstractWater {{scarcity}} is {{a widespread}} problem {{in many parts of}} the world. Most previous methods of <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> assessment only considered water quantity, and ignored water quality. In addition, the environmental flow requirement (EFR) was commonly not explicitly considered in the assessment. In this study, we developed an approach to assess <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> by considering both water quantity and quality, while at the same time explicitly considering EFR. We applied this quantity–quality-EFR (QQE) approach for the Huangqihai River Basin in Inner Mongolia, China. We found that to keep the river ecosystem health at a “good” level (i. e., suitable for swimming, fishing, and aquaculture), 26 % of the total <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> resources should be allocated to meet the EFR. When such a “good” level is maintained, the quantity- and quality-based <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> indicators were 1. 3 and 14. 2, respectively; both were above the threshold of 1. 0. The QQE <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> indicator thus can be expressed as 1. 3 (26 %) | 14. 2, indicating that the basin was suffering from scarcity problems related to both water quantity and water quality for a given rate of EFR. The current water consumption has resulted in degradation of the basin's river ecosystems, and the EFR cannot be met in 3 months of a year. To reverse this situation, future policies should aim to reduce water use and pollution discharge, meet the EFR for maintaining healthy river ecosystems, and substantially improve pollution treatment...|$|R

40|$|Large-scale {{acquisitions}} {{of agricultural}} land {{in developing countries}} have been rapidly increasing in the last 10 years, contributing to a major agrarian transition from subsistence or small scale farming to large-scale com- mercial agriculture by agribusiness transnational corporations. Likely driven by recent food crises, new bioenergy policies, and financial speculations, this phenomenon has been often investigated from the economic develop- ment, human right, land tenure and food security perspectives, while its hydrologic implications have remained understudied. It {{has been suggested that}} a major driver of large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs) is the quest for water resources that can be used (locally) to sustain agricultural production in the acquired land. The appropri- ation of water resources associated with LSLAs has often been termed ‘water grabbing’, though to date a formal definition of such a normative and inherently pejorative term is missing. The intrinsic assumption is that the ac- quisition of water undergoes the same dynamics of unbalanced power relationships that underlie many LSLAs. Here we invoke hydrological theories of “green” and “blue” water flows to stress the extent to which water ap- propriations are inherently coupled to land acquisitions and specifically focus on <b>blue</b> <b>water.</b> We then propose a formal definition of <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> grabbing based both on biophysical conditions (<b>water</b> <b>scarcity)</b> and ethical impli- cations (human right to food). <b>Blue</b> <b>water</b> grabs are appropriations of irrigation (i. e., <b>blue)</b> <b>water</b> in regions affect- ed by undernourishment and where agricultural production is constrained by <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> availability.

As a result, <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> has been prevalent in various regions of the world. Here, we present the first global assessment of past development of water stress considering not only climate variability but also growing water demand, desalinated water use and non-renewable groundwater abstraction over the period 1960 - 2001 at a spatial resolution of 0. 5 °. Agricultural water demand is estimated based on past extents of irrigated areas and livestock densities. We approximate past economic development based on GDP, energy and household consumption and electricity production, which are subsequently used together with population numbers to estimate industrial and domestic water demand. Climate variability is expressed by simulated <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> availability defined by freshwater in rivers, lakes, wetlands and reservoirs {{by means of the}} global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB. We thus define <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> stress by comparing <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> availability with corresponding net total <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> demand by means of the commonly used, <b>Water</b> <b>Scarcity</b> Index. The results show a drastic increase in the global population living under water-stressed conditions (i. e. moderate to high water stress) due to growing water demand, primarily for irrigation, which has more than doubled from 1708 / 818 to 3708 / 1832 km 3 yr- 1 (gross/net) over the period 1960 - 2000. We estimate that 800 million people or 27 % of the global population were living under water-stressed conditions for 1960. This number is eventually increased to 2. 6 billion or 43 % for 2000. Our results indicate that increased water demand is a decisive factor for heightened water stress in various regions such as India and North China, enhancing the intensity of water stress up to 200 %, while climate variability is often a main determinant of extreme events. However, our results also suggest that in several emerging and developing economies (e. g.
