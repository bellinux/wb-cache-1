5|$|Pulpitis is {{classified}} as reversible when the pain is mild to moderate and lasts {{for a short time}} after <b>a</b> <b>stimulus</b> (for instance, cold or sweet); or irreversible when the pain is severe, spontaneous, and lasts a long time after <b>a</b> <b>stimulus.</b> Left untreated, pulpitis may become irreversible, then progress to pulp necrosis (death of the pulp) and apical periodontitis. Abscesses usually cause throbbing pain. The apical abscess usually occurs after pulp necrosis, the pericoronal abscess is usually associated with acute pericoronitis of a lower wisdom tooth, and periodontal abscesses usually represent a complication of chronic periodontitis (gum disease). Much less commonly, non-dental conditions can cause toothache, such as maxillary sinusitis, which can cause pain in the upper back teeth, or angina pectoris, which can cause pain in the lower teeth.|$|E
5|$|The chief complaint, and {{the onset}} of the complaint, are usually {{important}} in the diagnosis of toothache. For example, the key distinction between reversible and irreversible pulpitis is given in the history, such as pain following <b>a</b> <b>stimulus</b> in the former, and lingering pain following <b>a</b> <b>stimulus</b> and spontaneous pain in the latter. History is also important in recent filling or other dental treatment, and trauma to the teeth. Based on the most common causes of toothache (dentin hypersensitivity, periodontitis, and pulpitis), the key indicators become localization of the pain (whether the pain is perceived as originating in a specific tooth), thermal sensitivity, pain on biting, spontaneity of the pain, and factors that make the pain worse.The various qualities of the toothache, such as the effect of biting and chewing on the pain, the effect of thermal stimuli, and the effect of the pain on sleep, are verbally established by the clinician, usually in a systematic fashion, such as using the Socrates pain assessment method (see table).|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{its history}} Goofus and Gallant has been {{interpreted}} as an effective didactic comic.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{determined}} experimentally that, when a stage IVb Phycomycea sporangiophore is subjected to <b>an</b> asymmetric avoidance <b>stimulus</b> (<b>a</b> single barrier), it uses its own net rotation to convert the spatial <b>stimulus</b> to <b>a</b> temporal one. This finding explains the sporangiophore's nonadaptation to <b>a</b> single-barrier <b>stimulus</b> and adaptation to <b>a</b> double-barrier <b>stimulus...</b>|$|R
30|$|Reuse: Programming {{the model}} {{transformation}} to automatically produce <b>a</b> <b>stimuli</b> generator by one specialist with integral dedication took 5 days of work (a total of approximately 40 h). Despite {{the learning curve}} associated to DEVS modeling, Xtend programming, and domain-specific knowledge to adapt model transformations, the model transformation can be reused in a myriad of other domains.

5|$|Unfortunately for the West India Company, {{the infant}} colony of New Netherland languished, the {{cautious}} Dutch people having very little inclination to emigrate to wild and uncultivated lands {{in which no}} substantial inducements were present. While the economic situation of the colony in the late 1620s {{could be considered a}} relatively good showing for a colony only newly started in a wilderness, its slow success was hardly sufficient to create much excitement among the directors of the West India Company. Within a few years, the Company realized that special measures which would afford <b>a</b> <b>stimulus</b> to colonization were indispensable.|$|E
50|$|Plants {{may respond}} both to {{directional}} and non-directional <b>stimuli.</b> <b>A</b> response to <b>a</b> directional <b>stimulus,</b> such as gravity or sunlight, {{is called a}} tropism.

5000|$|Ivan Pavlov {{conducted}} multiple experiments investigating digestion in dogs {{in which}} neutral, unconditioned, and conditioned stimuli were used. In these experiments, the neutral stimulus {{was the sound}} of a bell ringing. This sound was presented to the dogs along with food, which acted as <b>an</b> unconditioned <b>stimulus.</b> The presentation of <b>a</b> neutral <b>stimulus</b> does not result in any particular response, but the presentation of <b>an</b> unconditioned <b>stimulus</b> results in <b>an</b> unconditioned response, which was the dogs salivating in Pavlov's experiments. After conditioning, the bell ringing became <b>a</b> conditioned <b>stimulus.</b> [...] Pavlov later used the sound of a metronome as <b>a</b> neutral <b>stimulus</b> in studies on cerebral cortex activity.|$|R
5|$|In 1962, enthusiasts for Delius's music who {{had gone}} to Bradford for the centenary festival formed the Delius Society; Fenby became its first president. With around 400 members, the Society is {{independent}} from the Trust, but works closely with it. Its general objectives are the furtherance of knowledge of Delius's life and works, and the encouragement of performances and recordings. In 2004, as <b>a</b> <b>stimulus</b> for young musicians to study and perform Delius's music, the Society established an annual Delius Prize competition, with a prize of £1,000 to the winner. In June 1984, at the Grand Theatre, Leeds, the Delius Trust sponsored a commemorative production of A Village Romeo and Juliet by Opera North, to mark the 50th anniversary of Delius's death.|$|E
5|$|Nervous {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of many nerve cells known as neurons which transmit information. In some slow-moving radially symmetrical marine animals such as ctenophores and cnidarians (including sea anemones and jellyfish), the nerves form a nerve net, but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to <b>a</b> <b>stimulus.</b> In more complex animals, specialized receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found in groups and send messages along neural networks {{to other parts of}} the organism. Neurons can be connected together in ganglia. In higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and a peripheral nervous system. The latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system which conveys sensation and controls voluntary muscle, and the autonomic nervous system which involuntarily controls smooth muscle, certain glands and internal organs, including the stomach.|$|E
5|$|With Brownlee as premier and Reid as Provincial Treasurer, {{government}} deficits ceased: {{the budget}} showed a surplus in {{every year from}} 1925 until 1930, except for 1927. In 1929, Reid predicted that Alberta was {{on the cusp of}} a period of economic expansion; instead, he was soon confronted with the Great Depression. He drastically cut provincial spending and raised taxes, in part by creating a new income tax. He reluctantly accepted that these measures could not prevent a return to deficit spending. His willingness to outspend revenues was due less to any Keynesian desire to stimulate the economy than to a belief that there was no further spending to be cut or further taxes that could reasonably be raised. Conversely, he rejected calls from the opposition Liberals to cut taxes as <b>a</b> <b>stimulus</b> measure.|$|E

5|$|The {{controversial}} 1905 {{partition of}} Bengal had a widespread political impact. Acting as <b>a</b> <b>stimulus</b> for radical nationalist opinion in India and abroad, {{it became a}} focal issue for Indian revolutionaries. Revolutionary organisations like Jugantar and Anushilan Samiti had emerged in the 20th century. Several significant events took place. These included assassinations and attempted assassinations of civil servants, prominent public figures and Indian informants, including one in 1907 aiming to kill the Bengal Lieutenant-Governor Sir Andrew Fraser. Matters {{came to a head}} when the 1912 Delhi–Lahore Conspiracy, led by erstwhile Jugantar member Rash Behari Bose, attempted to assassinate the then Viceroy of India, Charles Hardinge. In the aftermath of this event, the British Indian police made concentrated police and intelligence efforts to destroy the Bengali and Punjabi revolutionary underground. Though the movement came under intense pressure for some time, Rash Behari successfully evaded capture for nearly three years. By the time World War I had begun in Europe in 1914, the revolutionary movement had revived in Punjab and Bengal. In Bengal the movement, with a safe haven in the French base of Chandernagore, had sufficient strength to all but paralyse the state administration. The earliest mention of a conspiracy for armed revolution in India appears in Nixon's Report on Revolutionary Organisation, which reported that Jatin Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin) and Naren Bhattacharya had met the Crown Prince of Germany during the latter's visit to Calcutta in 1912, and obtained an assurance that they would receive supplies of arms and ammunition. At the same time an increasingly strong pan-Islamic movement started developing, mainly in the north and north-west regions of India. With the onset of the war in 1914, the members of this movement formed {{an important component of the}} conspiracy.|$|E

5000|$|In {{behavioral}} psychology, <b>stimulus</b> {{control is}} <b>a</b> phenomenon {{that occurs when}} an organism behaves in one way {{in the presence of}} <b>a</b> given <b>stimulus</b> and another way in its absence.

50|$|Specific PIT {{and general}} PIT also occur with {{aversive}} stimuli and are defined analogously.

40|$|An {{important}} factor affecting preference formation is {{the context in}} which that preference decision takes place. The current research examined whether one's preference formed for <b>a</b> previously presented <b>stimulus</b> influences the processing of a subsequent preference decision, henceforth referred to as the preference sequence effect. Using a novel sequential rating/judgment paradigm, the present study demonstrated the presence of a preference sequence effect using artistic photographs and face stimuli: <b>A</b> neutral <b>stimulus</b> was preferred more following <b>a</b> preferable <b>stimulus</b> than <b>a</b> less preferable <b>stimulus.</b> Furthermore, <b>a</b> similar trend was found even when the potential influence of response bias was controlled. These results suggest that an assimilative sequential effect exists even when sequential judgments are made solely based on one's subjective feeling; preference formed for <b>a</b> preceding <b>stimulus</b> modulates preference for <b>a</b> subsequent <b>stimulus.</b> This implies the need for a consideration of trial sequence as a factor creating a psychological context affecting the subsequent preference decisions...|$|R
