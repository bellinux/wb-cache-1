5|$|Despite tensions, {{the march}} was <b>a</b> <b>resounding</b> success. More {{than a quarter}} of a million people of diverse ethnicities {{attended}} the event, sprawling from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial onto the National Mall and around the reflecting pool. At the time, it was the largest gathering of protesters in Washington, D.C.'s history.|$|E
5|$|The party docked at Tilbury on Friday 16 April to <b>a</b> <b>resounding</b> welcome. Bradman {{announced}} {{the delivery of}} 17,000 food parcels {{as a gift to}} the British people from the State of Victoria. Great Britain was still in the throes of rationing and post-war austerity.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} declaration, {{there was still}} {{substantial}} support for James in Scotland. Viscount Dundee raised an army in the Scottish Highlands and won a convincing victory at Killiecrankie on 27 July. The huge losses suffered by Dundee's troops, however, coupled with his fatal wounding {{at the start of}} the battle, served to remove the only effective resistance to William and the uprising was quickly crushed, suffering <b>a</b> <b>resounding</b> defeat the next month at the Battle of Dunkeld.|$|E

5|$|Low, Harris {{and their}} ships left the Azores for the Carolinas. On 10 June 1723, they {{suffered}} <b>a</b> <b>resounding</b> defeat {{in a battle}} with , a heavily armed man of war. Greyhound had been dispatched {{under the command of}} Peter Solgard to hunt down Low and his fleet. Low fled in the Fancy with a skeleton crew and £150,000 in gold on board and headed back to the Azores, leaving Harris and the Ranger behind.|$|E
5|$|Senator Roberts {{proposed}} legislation {{at the start}} of session regarding the surety bond required for towing carriers in rural areas. SB12-049 would have lowered the surety bond from $50,000 to $10,000 for local entities. The bill was assigned to the Senate Transportation Committee, but was postponed indefinitely after it was introduced. However, after the bill was killed, public upheaval caused Roberts to introduce a new bill, this time in the House, which resolved the same issue. HB12-1347 passed the second time around with <b>a</b> <b>resounding</b> 98-1 vote.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Stillman's run was {{a turning}} point. Prior to this battle, Black Hawk had not been {{committed}} to war. Now he determined to avenge {{what he saw as}} the treacherous killing of his warriors under a flag of truce. After Stillman's defeat, American leaders like President Jackson and Secretary of War Lewis Cass would not consider a diplomatic solution; they wanted <b>a</b> <b>resounding</b> victory over Black Hawk to serve as an example to other Native Americans who might consider similar uprisings.|$|E

25|$|Another {{battle was}} fought at Manassas—the Second Battle of Manassas, ending in <b>a</b> second <b>resounding</b> {{loss for the}} Union.

5|$|The Red Turban Rebellion saw the {{application}} of early, arrow-firing cannon to both siege and naval warfare in the Southern area of conflict. Following the ascendancy of the Ming Dynasty, cannon were restricted at first to operations pacifying the southern border, including <b>a</b> <b>resounding</b> victory over a band of war-elephants in the 1380s. Cannon {{made their way to}} the northern border by 1414, where their noise had great effect on the Oirats, in addition to reportedly killing several hundred Mongols.|$|E
5|$|The team {{travelled}} to Europe in pre-season, playing friendlies against Eintracht Braunschweig and Standard Liège. After {{returning to}} England they played Portsmouth at Fratton Park, winning 2–0, and finished their preparations with <b>a</b> <b>resounding</b> home win against Borussia Dortmund. Between matches, the players followed a fitness plan created by former athlete Joe Lancaster, under instruction from Malcolm Allison. The training regime was initially unpopular with the players; {{the severity of}} the first session caused some players to vomit.|$|E
5|$|A {{large portion}} of the Persian army was trapped in its camp and slaughtered. The {{destruction}} of this army, and the remnants of the Persian navy allegedly on the same day at the Battle of Mycale, decisively ended the invasion. After Plataea and Mycale the Greek allies would take the offensive against the Persians, marking a new phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Plataea was in every sense <b>a</b> <b>resounding</b> victory, {{it does not seem to}} have been attributed the same significance (even at the time) as, for example, the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon or the Spartan defeat at Thermopylae.|$|E
50|$|In {{the closing}} {{years of the}} Heian period, {{at the place where}} the emperor (Emperor Konoe) lived, the Seiryō-den, there {{appeared}} a cloud of black smoke along with <b>an</b> eerie <b>resounding</b> crying voice, making Emperor Nijō quite afraid. Subsequently the emperor fell into illness, and neither medicine nor prayers had any effect.|$|R

50|$|Bizarrely, though, the Wolfhounds have a {{good record}} against {{traditionally}} stronger South African opponents. They have won their only match against their South African counterparts South Africa A by 3 points. Additionally, they have played two fixtures against South Africa XV ('XV' teams are above 'A' level but below full test level), drawing once and winning the other encounter by <b>a</b> surprisingly <b>resounding</b> 17 points.|$|R
5|$|He {{was born}} in the Saxon duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, to a family {{connected}} to many of Europe's ruling monarchs. At the age of 20, he married his first cousin, Queen Victoria; they had nine children. Initially he felt constrained by his role of consort, which did not afford him any power or responsibilities, but gradually developed a reputation for supporting many public causes, such as educational reform and the abolition of slavery worldwide, and was entrusted with running the Queen's household, office and estates. He was heavily involved with the organisation of the Great Exhibition of 1851, which was <b>a</b> <b>resounding</b> success.|$|E
5|$|In 6 BC, Tiberius {{launched}} a pincer movement against the Marcomanni. Setting out northwest from Carnuntum on the Danube with four legions, Tiberius passed through Quadi territory {{in order to}} invade the Marcomanni from the east. Meanwhile, general Gaius Sentius Saturninus would depart east from Moguntiacum on the Rhine {{with two or three}} legions, pass through newly annexed Hermunduri territory, and attack the Marcomanni from the west. The campaign was <b>a</b> <b>resounding</b> success, but Tiberius could not subjugate the Marcomanni because he was soon summoned to the Rhine frontier to protect Rome's new conquests in Germania.|$|E
5|$|The convention, held on October 1, 1930, {{proved to}} be a turning point both for the party and for Macdonald. In a {{departure}} from tradition, the party's new leader would be chosen by convention delegates instead of Liberal caucus members at the legislature. Two veterans of Liberal politics, both wealthy businessmen, were contesting the leadership. There was little enthusiasm, however, for either. Just as nominations were about to close, a delegate from Truro rose unexpectedly to nominate Macdonald. Surprised, Macdonald at first declined the nomination, then agreed to accept it when he sensed strong support on the convention floor. A few hours later, the 40-year-old Macdonald had won <b>a</b> <b>resounding</b> first-ballot victory to become the new Liberal leader.|$|E

5|$|The pre-game buildup focused {{primarily}} on the strong rushing attacks of both teams {{as well as the}} overall sound offense of Fresno State. Most analysts predicted <b>a</b> <b>resounding</b> victory by Fresno State. The point spread favored Fresno State as 12-point favorites over the Mustangs. Contrary to predictions, SMU won the game by a score of 43-10, largely thanks to the play of defensive end Margus Hunt, who forced two fumbles and totaled three sacks (including one safety) as well as two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns. Consequently, Hunt and Fresno State's Davante Adams, who totaled 13 receptions for 144 yards and a touchdown, were named the game's co-Most Valuable Player (MVP).|$|E
5|$|Winning the big prizes of Florida and Texas {{and many}} of the Southern {{primaries}} on Super Tuesday gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California Governor Jerry Brown was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South. With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates. He scored <b>a</b> <b>resounding</b> victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate. Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in Jerry Brown's home state of California.|$|E
5|$|In 1954–55 England toured Australia {{for five}} Ashes Tests. Davidson started his season well, scoring 30 and 27 not out {{and taking a}} total of 5/104 as New South Wales drew with England. His victims {{included}} leading batsmen Colin Cowdrey and Bill Edrich. However, Davidson succumbed to injury and missed Australia's only win of the series in the First Test, and upon his return in the Second Test, managed match figures of 2/86 and did not pass twenty in either innings as England levelled the series. He was dropped for the Third Test, but continued to perform strongly in domestic matches, including a sequence of 19 wickets in three matches. This included 4/45 including the wickets of Compton, Bailey and Graveney in a tour match against England, and a match-winning performance against arch-rivals Victoria that sealed a second successive Shield triumph with <b>a</b> <b>resounding</b> nine-wicket win in two days. He tore through the Victorians with 5/36 and 4/50, removing Harvey and Test all rounder Sam Loxton twice. It was his best match bowling figures in his career to date.|$|E

50|$|After Canada's {{victory over}} the United States, they got shocked by the Mexican team in <b>a</b> 9-1 <b>resounding</b> defeat. Unfortunately for the Canadian side, this victory would {{eventually}} cost them {{the trip to the}} 2nd round of the tournament after the United States beat South Africa 17-0 and clinched the second place in Pool B. Canada, USA, and Mexico each finished with a 2-1 record in the pool, but Canada lost the tie-breaker based on runs allowed.|$|R

5|$|In the 1926–27 season, Cowan made 27 {{appearances}} as {{his club}} sought an immediate {{return to the}} top division. The race for promotion went to the final match, with Manchester City and Portsmouth both in contention for {{the second of the}} two promotion places. Cowan played in <b>a</b> <b>resounding</b> City win, an 8–0 victory against Bradford City. The watching crowd believed the result to be sufficient for promotion, but Portsmouth's match had been delayed by 15 minutes and was still in progress. A late Portsmouth goal meant the final scoreline in their match was a 5–1 win, enough to give Portsmouth second place on goal average by a margin of one two-hundredth of a goal. The club won the Second Division championship the following season, gaining promotion to the top flight. The Second Division championship was Cowan's first honour in professional football.|$|E
5|$|Spain {{were again}} amongst the favourites for cup {{victory in the}} 2014 World Cup, but had a very disappointing {{campaign}} that ended in the first round. Alonso scored a penalty in the 27th minute of their first match against the Netherlands, though he was substituted in the 62nd minute with Spain down 2–1. The match ultimately ended with <b>a</b> <b>resounding</b> 5–1 win for the Netherlands. Spain then suffered another defeat, this time falling 2–0 to Chile. In that match, Alonso received a yellow card {{in the first half}} and was substituted at half-time with the score already at 2–0. Spain were then eliminated from the tournament but did win their final match 3–0 against Australia and finished third in the group; Alonso played 83 minutes in the match.|$|E
5|$|The Mariners' inaugural {{season was}} {{considered}} <b>a</b> <b>resounding</b> success by most; the team reached the 2006 A-League Grand Final after finishing third {{during the regular}} season. Central Coast was defeated by Sydney FC 1–0 {{in front of a}} crowd of 41,689—a competition record at the time. The Mariners also won the 2005 Pre-Season Cup, defeating Perth Glory in the final 1–0. Before the 2006–07 A-League season, the Mariners secured the services of then-Australian international Tony Vidmar from NAC Breda for two years. This was the club's first marquee signing, following the lead of Sydney FC (Dwight Yorke) and Adelaide United (Qu Shengqing). Central Coast again reached the grand final in the 2006 Pre-Season Cup, losing to Adelaide United 5–4 on penalties after the score was tied 1–1 after extra time. The Mariners then participated in the 2006–07 A-League season, but was unable to gain a spot in the final series, finishing sixth after the regular season.|$|E

60|$|Suddenly {{there was}} a challenge. 'Halt, who goes there?' 'The Ladysmith Relief Column,' and thereat from out of {{trenches}} and rifle pits artfully concealed in the scrub a score of tattered men came running, cheering feebly, and some were crying.
