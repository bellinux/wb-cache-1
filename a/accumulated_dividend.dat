40|$|Canonical {{valuation}} uses historical {{time series}} {{to predict the}} probability distribution of the discounted value of primary assets' discounted prices plus <b>accumulated</b> <b>dividends</b> at any future date. Then the axiomatically rationalized maximum entropy principle is used to estimate risk-neutral (equivalent martingale) probabilities that correctly price the primary assets, {{as well as any}} predesignated subset of derivative securities whose payoffs occur at this date. Valuation of other derivative securities proceeds by calculation of its discounted, risk-neutral expected value. Both simulation and empirical evidence suggest that canonical valuation has merit.

40|$|Usually the {{dividend}} policy {{is seen as}} a way to approach the distribution of profit on the two classical directions. But {{the dividend}} policy influences the market value of a company, and if those who decide over this problem do not have an ethical behaviour, but pursue to distribute a great part of the profit as dividends under the form of free shares, contributes to the decrease in the current price of the company’s shares. The conclusion drawn from the present study is that the market value of a company will grow only if the distributed dividend is situated on a continuous upward curve. This fact imposes to resort sometimes to <b>accumulated</b> <b>dividends</b> and other times to the reduction of the part from the profit meant for investments in order to complete the dividends so that they are greater than in the previous year. the dividend policy; the company’s market value; the invested profit; the rate of dividend per share; the residual dividends; the accumulated dividends; the free shares; the company’s market image; the subscription rights. ...|$|R

50|$|In 2004, Alfa Group's {{daughter}} company «Storm» filed {{a number}} of lawsuits against Telenor, to nullify {{a number of}} provisions in the Kyivstar charter and shareholder agreement. Alfa Group especially wanted to nullify an arbitration case that Telenor had lodged in New York, but was rejected. Alfa reacted to their legal loss by boycotting all normal shareholder activity in Kyivstar, for four years from 2004, effectively blocking the business of annual assemblies, and avoiding the consolidation and ratification of Kyivstar's annual accounts. No dividends were paid after 2003. In February 2006, Telenor took the issue to a U.S Federal court in New York. On 16 December 2008, Alfa Group resumed normal shareholder activities, joined in {{the election of a}} new board of directors, and agreed to pay <b>accumulated</b> <b>dividends.</b> On 11 March 2009, the Federal district court in New York ruled for the second time that Alfa companies Altimo, Storm, Alpren and Hardlake had revealed contempt for the court by not depositing their Kyivstar shares in the United States. Alfa Group was convicted to daily penalties of US$100,000 from 12 March, and a further 100,000 daily if not either Alfa's shares in Kyivstar be sold, or ownership in competing business be reduced to a maximum 5%. NeOn 28 April 2009, the New York court ruled that Alfa Group had submitted to the legal rulings. Judge Gerard E. Lynch established that Alfa Group had reduced their ownership in competing mobile operations in Ukraine.|$|R
40|$|The {{adjustment}} of accrued dividends on {{cumulative preferred stock}} is an absorbing problem {{both in terms of}} legal doctrine and practical implications. The problem is essentially dynamic and controversial, calling for the exercise of careful judgments on the basis of public policy.

50|$|Like common stock, {{preferred}} stocks represent partial ownership in a company. Preferred stock shareholders {{may or may}} not enjoy any of the voting rights of those holding common stock. Also, unlike common stock, a preferred stock pays a fixed dividend that does not fluctuate. Often the dividend is cumulative. Thus, the company must pay all unpaid preferred <b>dividends</b> <b>accumulated</b> during previous periods before it can pay dividends to common shareholders. If the company is unable to pay this dividend, the preferred shareholders may have the right to force a liquidation of the company.|$|R

50|$|The carbon {{neutrality}} of wood pellet fuel {{has been the}} focus of academic discussions recently. A study by the Manomet group proposed a model on the effects of biomass energy on atmospheric carbon levels. With this model a carbon debt occurs at the time of harvest and a carbon dividend occurs as new trees replace the harvested ones. This model describes wood pellet heat as a less than carbon neutral energy source. MESys co-director and economist Bill Strauss has written a rebuttal to this study which was published in the July 2011 edition of Biomass Power & Thermal Magazine, claiming that there are other methods of modeling biomass energy and that they were not well enough explored in the Manomet study. Strauss claims that the chosen Manomet model ignores the carbon <b>dividend</b> <b>accumulated</b> prior to harvest by the trees being harvested.|$|R
5000|$|Although life {{insurance}} is often sold {{with a view}} toward the [...] "living benefits" [...] (<b>accumulated</b> cash and <b>dividend</b> values), this feature is a byproduct of the level premium nature of the contract. The original intent was not to [...] "sugar coat" [...] the product; rather it is {{a necessary part of}} the design. However, prospective purchasers are often more motivated by the thought of being able to [...] "count my money in the future." [...] Policies purchased at younger ages will usually have guaranteed cash values greater than the sum of all premiums paid after a number of years. Sales tactics frequently appeal to this self-interest (sometimes called [...] "the greed motive"). It is a reflection of human behavior that people are often more willing to talk about money for their own future than to discuss provisions for the family in case of premature death (the [...] "fear motive"). On the other hand, many policies purchased due to selfish motives will become vital family resources later in a time of need.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} some of {{the important}} aspects of Japan's unprecedented population aging on its postwar economy, by drawing heavily upon the computed results of the NTA-Japan project, ranging from {{the first and second}} demographic dividends to the lifestyle reallocations. We also shed light on the rapidly changing roles of public and familial support systems for the elderly in Japan, that have evolved together with the family organizational transformation and the rapid development of the social security system over the past several decades. One of the principal findings of this paper is that an effective use of the demographic <b>dividends,</b> particularly the <b>accumulated</b> second demographic <b>dividend</b> which is likely to remain substantial for the next few decades, appears to be an attractive policy option for Japan to place its future economic growth on a steady path. Another important finding derived from this study is that, since the bursting of the bubble economy in the early 1990 s, Japanese elderly persons have been informally playing the role of the society's safety net in providing financial assistance to their adult children and/or grandchildren through the traditional familial transfer mechanism...|$|R
