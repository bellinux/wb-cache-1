25|$|A residual-current {{circuit breaker}} cannot remove all risk of {{electric}} shock or fire. In particular, an RCD <b>alone</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> detect overload conditions, phase-to-neutral short circuits or phase-to-phase short circuits (see three-phase electric power). Over-current protection (fuses or circuit breakers) must be provided. Circuit breakers that combine the functions of an RCD with overcurrent protection respond to both types of fault. These are known as RCBOs and are available in 2-, 3- and 4-pole configurations. RCBOs will typically have separate circuits for detecting current imbalance and for overload current but use a common interrupting mechanism.|$|E
25|$|A {{release of}} methane from clathrates, however, is {{believed}} to be slow and chronic rather than catastrophic and that 21st-century effects of such a release are therefore likely to be 'significant but not catastrophic'. It is further noted that 'much methane from dissociated gas hydrate may never reach the atmosphere', as it can be dissolved into the ocean and be broken down biologically. Other research demonstrates that a release to the atmosphere can occur during large releases. These sources suggest that the clathrate gun effect <b>alone</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be sufficient to cause 'catastrophic' climate change within a human lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Through his {{research}} with the rats, he learned that forgetting was dependent {{on the amount of}} tissue removed and not where it was removed from. He called this mass action and he believed that it was a general rule that governed how brain tissue would respond, independent of the type of learning. But we know now that mass action was true for these rats, because learning to run a maze is known as complex learning and it requires multiple cortical areas, so cutting into individual parts <b>alone</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> erase the memory from the rats' brains, but taking large sections removes multiple cortical areas at one time and so they can forget.|$|E

25|$|Eligibility {{criteria}} for proving Sephardic descent include: a certificate {{issued by the}} Federation of Jewish Communities of Spain, or {{the production of a}} certificate from the competent rabbinic authority, legally recognized in the country of habitual residence of the applicant, or other documentation which might be considered appropriate for this purpose; or by justifying one's inclusion as a Sephardic descendant, or a direct descendant of persons included in the list of protected Sephardic families in Spain referred to in the Decree-Law of 29 December 1948, or descendants of those who obtained naturalization by way of the Royal Decree of 20 December 1924; or by the combination of other factors including surnames of the applicant, spoken family language (Spanish, Ladino, Haketia), and other evidence attesting descent from Sephardic Jews and a relationship to Spain. Surnames alone, language alone, or other evidence <b>alone</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be determinative in the granting of Spanish nationality.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{historians have}} found that {{societies}} in the Northern Hemisphere experience higher standards of living, and that as latitude increases north or south from the equator, levels of real GDP per capita also increases. Climate is closely correlated with agricultural production since without ideal weather conditions, agriculture <b>alone</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> produce the surplus supply needed to build and maintain economies. Locations with hot tropical climates often suffer underdevelopment due to low fertility of soils, excessive plant respiration, ecological conditions favoring infectious diseases, and unreliable water supply. These factors can cause tropical zones to suffer a 30% to 50% decrease in productivity relative to temperate climate zones. Tropical infectious diseases that thrive in hot and moist equatorial climates cause thousands of deaths each year. They are also an economic drain on society due to high medical costs, and the unwillingness of foreign capital {{to invest in a}} sickly state. Because infectious diseases like malaria often need a warm ecology for growth, states in the mid to high latitudes are naturally protected from the devastating effects of disease.|$|E

Horses sleep better when in groups because some animals will sleep while others stand guard to watch for predators. A horse kept <b>alone</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> sleep well because its instincts are to keep a constant eye out for danger.|$|E

Kurzweil claims imaging technologies such as PET and fMRI are increasing exponentially in resolution while he predicts even greater detail will be obtained during the 2020s when it becomes possible to scan the brain from the inside using nanobots. Once the physical structure and connectivity information are known, Kurzweil says researchers will have to produce functional models of sub-cellular components and synapses all the way up to whole brain regions. The human brain is [...] "a complex hierarchy of complex systems, but it does not represent a level of complexity beyond what we are already capable of handling".|$|E
2500|$|Reduplicated {{babbling}} (such as bababa) {{involves a}} rhythmic {{opening and closing}} of the jaw. [...] According to the Frame Dominance Theory, when the mandible (jaw) is elevated, a consonant sound will be produced. When the mandible is lowered, a vowel-like sound is produced. Therefore, during a reduplicated sequence of sounds, the consonant and vowels are alternated as the mandible elevates and depresses. The opening and closing of the mouth <b>alone</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> produce babbling, and phonation (or voicing) is necessary during the movement {{in order to create}} a meaningful sound. [...] Other important oral structures involved in articulation, such as the tongue, lips and teeth remain in a stable resting position during babbling. Sometimes during the babbling period, the motions can be made without any vocalization at all. Signing infants produce manual babbling through similar rhythmic alternations, but they perform with their hands instead of their mouths. As a baby goes beyond the reduplicated sequences of babbling, they exhibit equal sized mouth or hand openings on the right and left sides.|$|E

Especially if they are {{delivering}} <b>alone,</b> they <b>will</b> <b>not</b> have the time nor the funds to adequately prepare for labor and delivery.
