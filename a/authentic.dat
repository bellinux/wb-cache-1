5|$|Although the Koran {{does not}} mention details of Joseph's burial, Islamic {{tradition}} points to Nablus as being the <b>authentic</b> site. However, some early Islamic geographers identified the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron as housing his tomb. While Ali of Herat (1119), Yaqut (1229) and Ibn Battuta (1369) all report the Hebron traditions, they also mention {{the existence of a}} tomb of Joseph at Nablus. Later Muslim chroniclers even mention a third site purporting to be the <b>authentic</b> tomb, near Beit Ijza.|$|E
5|$|<b>Authentic</b> was {{pocket book}} size (7.25 × 4.75inches) {{for most of}} its life, {{changing}} to digest size (7.5 × 5.5inches) for the last eight issues. The issue numbering was consecutive from 1 to 85, with no volume numbers. The first issue had a publication date of 1 January 1951, and the first eight issues had publication dates of the 1st and 15th of each month. From the ninth issue to the end <b>Authentic</b> maintained a completely regular monthly schedule; the publication date was given in the magazine as the 15th of each month from issue 9 through issue 73; thereafter the date was just given as the month and year.|$|E
5|$|Connoisseurship in {{the late}} Ming period {{centered}} on these items of refined artistic taste, which provided work for art dealers and even underground scammers who themselves made imitations and false attributions. The Jesuit Matteo Ricci while staying in Nanjing wrote that Chinese scam artists were ingenious at making forgeries and huge profits. However, there were guides to help the wary new connoisseur; Liu Tong (died 1637) wrote a book printed in 1635 that told his readers how to spot fake and <b>authentic</b> pieces of art. He revealed that a Xuande era (1426–1435) bronzework could be authenticated by judging its sheen; porcelain wares from the Yongle era (1402–1424) could be judged <b>authentic</b> by their thickness.|$|E

5|$|Friday Night Lights {{is unusual}} for using actual {{locations}} rather than stage sets and sound stage. These factors together with reliance on filming hundreds of locals as extras, gives the series an <b>authentic</b> feel and look.|$|E

5|$|Steiner's {{books as}} Stümpke have been {{translated}} into other languages, sometimes crediting other names based on the country of publication. Harald Stümpke, Massimo Pandolfi, Hararuto Shutyunpuke, and Karl D. S. Geeste are pseudonyms, while translator names are <b>authentic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Mar Saba {{letter was}} {{attributed}} to Clement by Morton Smith, but there remains much debate today over whether it is an <b>authentic</b> letter from Clement, an ancient pseudepigraph or a modern forgery. If <b>authentic,</b> its main significance would be in its relating that the Apostle Mark came to Alexandria from Rome and there wrote a more spiritual Gospel, which he entrusted to the Church in Alexandria on his death; if genuine, the letter pushes back the tradition related by Eusebius connecting Mark with Alexandria by a century.|$|E
5|$|Under Campbell <b>Authentic</b> {{improved}} somewhat, {{and continued}} its metamorphosis into a magazine, with additional non-fiction writing, and short fiction {{in addition to}} the main novel in each issue. Hamilton also ran a science fiction paperback imprint, Panther Books, which would go on {{to become one of the}} leading British sf houses. By 1953 the British sf market was going through a metamorphosis similar to the one going in the US at the same time: poor quality sf markets were failing, and the result was a reduced but active market, with four magazines: <b>Authentic,</b> New Worlds, Science Fantasy, and Nebula Science Fiction.|$|E

5|$|A second group, the Foundation for the Pure Spanish Horse or PRE Mundial, {{has begun}} another PRE {{registry}} {{as an alternative}} to the ANCCE. This new registry claims that all of their registered horses trace back to the original stud book maintained by the Cria Caballar, which was a branch of the Spanish Ministry of Defense, for 100 years. Thus, the PRE Mundial registry asserts that their registry is the most <b>authentic,</b> purest PRE registry functioning today.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the middle}} of the film we show the Purim festival, a victory festival which the Jews {{celebrate}} as a festival of revenge on the Goyim, the Christians. Here I am depicting <b>authentic</b> Jewry as it was then and as it now continues unchecked in Poland. In contrast to this original Jewry, we are presented with Süss, the elegant financial adviser to the Court, the clever politician in short, the Jew in disguise.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1870, chemists {{thought that there}} should be an alkali metal beyond caesium, with an atomic number of 87. It was then {{referred}} to by the provisional name eka-caesium. Research teams attempted to locate and isolate this missing element, and at least four false claims were made that the element had been found before an <b>authentic</b> discovery was made.|$|E
5|$|Before King {{published}} {{the discovery of}} the fragment, she asked AnneMarie Luijendijk and fellow papyrologist Roger S. Bagnall of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University to review the fragment. They determined that it was likely <b>authentic,</b> both because of the skills which would have been required to forge the fragment, and because the papyrus seemed to have been in a collection for many years without having been announced. Luijendijk and Bagnall both doubted that the text was forged. Giovanni Maria Vian the editor of L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's official newspaper, dismissed the fragment as fake. In a television documentary about the fragment that was presented on the Smithsonian Channel in September 2012, Professor Alberto Camplani of Sapienza University of Rome suggested that he considered it more likely to be <b>authentic.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Warde's article was {{published}} some revivals {{had been released}} that were more <b>authentic</b> revivals of Garamond's work, based on period books and printing specimens. The German company Stempel brought out a crisp revival of the original Garamond typefaces in the 1920s, inspired by a rediscovered specimen from the Egenolff-Berner foundry in Frankfurt, as did Linotype in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{essentially}} African American {{nature of}} ragtime, {{it is most}} commonly considered the first style of American popular music to be truly black music; ragtime brought syncopation and a more <b>authentic</b> black sound to popular music. Popular ragtime songs were notated and sold as sheet music, but the general style was played more informally across the nation; these amateur performers played a more free-flowing form of ragtime that eventually became a major formative influence on jazz.|$|E
5|$|Gary Cooper (born Frank James Cooper; May 7, 1901 – May 13, 1961) was an American film actor {{known for}} his natural, <b>authentic,</b> and {{understated}} acting style and screen performances. His career spanned thirty-five years, from 1925 to 1960, and included leading roles in eighty-four feature films. He was a major movie star {{from the end of}} the silent film era through to the end of the golden age of Classical Hollywood. His screen persona appealed strongly to both men and women, and his range of performances included roles in most major movie genres. Cooper's ability to project his own personality onto the characters he played contributed to his appearing natural and <b>authentic</b> on screen. The screen persona he sustained throughout his career represented the ideal American hero.|$|E
5|$|His {{influence}} has been wide-ranging. In India, S. K. Maitra, Anilbaran Roy and D. P. Chattopadhyaya commented on Sri Aurobindo's work. Writers on esotericism and traditional wisdom, such as Mircea Eliade, Paul Brunton, and Rene Guenon, all {{saw him as}} an <b>authentic</b> representative of the Indian spiritual tradition.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{after two}} centuries, the Holy See re-assessed the issue. Pope Pius XII issued a decree on December 8, 1939, authorizing Chinese Catholics {{to observe the}} ancestral rites and {{participate}} in Confucius-honoring ceremonies. The general principle of sometimes admitting native traditions even into the liturgy of the church, provided that such traditions harmonize with the true and <b>authentic</b> spirit of the liturgy, was proclaimed by the Second Vatican Council (1962–65).|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Flagstad {{family of}} Green Bay {{donated to the}} Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame an <b>authentic</b> Packers No. 14 jersey worn by Hutson. The jersey {{was found in a}} trunk of old uniforms in 1946 at the Rockwood Lodge, the Packers' summer {{training}} camp from 1946 to 1949, owned by Melvin and Helen Flagstad. The jersey, a rare NFL artifact valued at over $17,000, was donated by son Daniel Flagstad in memory of his parents.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the speeches, there are fifty-six prologues (openings of speeches). They were collected for the Library of Alexandria by Callimachus, who believed them genuine. Modern scholars are divided: some reject them, while others, such as Blass, believe they are <b>authentic.</b> Finally, six letters also survive under Demosthenes's name and their authorship too is hotly debated.|$|E
5|$|In early 1957, Tubb persuaded Hamilton {{to switch}} the {{magazine}} from pocket-book to digest size format, {{in the hope}} that this would improve the magazine's visibility on bookstalls. The circulation did indeed rise, to about 14,000 copies per month—a surprisingly low figure given Landsborough's assertion that <b>Authentic</b> had been selling 30,000 copies in the early days. However, later that year, Hamilton made the decision to invest a substantial sum in the UK paperback rights of an American best-seller: it is not known for certain which book this was, but it is thought to have been Evan Hunter's The Blackboard Jungle. Hamilton could no longer afford to have cash tied up in <b>Authentic,</b> and in the summer of 1957 Tubb was given two months to close down the magazine, printing stories that had already been paid for. The last issue was dated October 1957.|$|E
5|$|Kaksparsh {{was shot}} in the real {{locations}} than sets and was mainly shot in Paalshet, a village near Guhagar in Konkan. As the film's story-line was set around 1930–1950, Manjrekar was concerned about the <b>authentic</b> production design for the film. He appointed two production designers, Prashant Rane and Abhishek Vijaykar, who had challenges of depicting pre and post Indian independence era. Rane had worked with Manjrekar earlier for De Dhakka (2008). Kaksparsh shooting was completed in 26 days; starting from 5 December 2011 till 30 December 2011. The initial shooting scheduled started at Ranade Wada in Pune. The film also had a few scenes in and surrounding the temple but as most of the temples in Konkan region have been restored from their damages over the period of time, Manjrekar feared that the plastering done to repair the damages would not give the desired <b>authentic</b> feel to the film. Thus, the next schedule was shifted to Krishna Ghat, Wai, Maharashtra.|$|E
5|$|Konnan {{returned}} to TNA on February 12, 2003 {{and formed a}} short-lived villainous alliance, the <b>Authentic</b> Luchadores, with fellow Hispanic wrestlers Juventud Guerrera, Super Crazy and The S.A.T.(Spanish Announce Team). The stable feuded with Jerry Lynn until April 2, 2003, when Lynn claimed {{that he had been}} heavily influenced by lucha libre and that he respected his Mexican opponents, thus earning the friendship of Konnan.|$|E
5|$|Las Olas Boulevard is {{a popular}} {{thoroughfare}} in downtown Fort Lauderdale that runs from Andrews Avenue in the Central Business District to A1A and Fort Lauderdale Beach. The boulevard {{is a popular}} attraction for locals and visitors, being ideally situated close to Fort Lauderdale beach, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and Port Everglades. It {{is considered to be}} South Florida's most architecturally unique, <b>authentic,</b> and eclectic shopping and dining district.|$|E
5|$|Martial also {{suggests}} {{the rape of}} a woman by a bull in a re-creation of the myth of Pasiphaë. Nero had provided a similar entertainment at an event he had staged using an actor dressed in the costume of a bull, though Martial claims that the act performed at the inaugural games was <b>authentic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mary, however, is {{depicted}} as <b>authentic</b> rather than artificial, detesting fashionable life rather than yearning after it. Mary's charitable works, for example, are not a passing fad: they are a heartfelt reaction to social injustice. Even though she is older and intellectual instead of young and pretty, Mary asserts her right to sexual desire rather than sublimating it.|$|E
