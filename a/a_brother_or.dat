Afterward, some locals identified the men as Pashtuns named Arshad and Tareq Khan.

Pakistani officials have found no record of an Arshad Khan in that area and suspect the men were living under false identities.|$|E

At dawn on 26August 1942, the Partisan 4th Kordun Brigade attacked the camp and dispersed the Ustaše guard force. The children heard the shooting and began shouting that the Partisans had arrived. Despite attempts by the nuns to hide the children, Partisan troops broke into the buildings and rescued many children. Some of the fighters even found <b>a</b> <b>brother</b> <b>or</b> sister within the camp. The Partisans gave what food they had to the children, and led away from the camp all the children that could walk.|$|E

500|$|Another historian, Forrest Scott, {{guessed that}} Siward {{was a member}} of the family of Northumbrian earls, presumably {{connected}} in some way to Siward, Earl of Northumbria. Margaret Faull and Marie Stinson, the editors of the Philimore Domesday Book for Yorkshire, believed that Siward was [...] "a senior member of the house of Bamburgh and possibly <b>a</b> <b>brother</b> <b>or</b> half-brother of Earl Gospatric". Another historian, Geoffrey Barrow, pointed out that Faull and Stinson gave no evidence for this assertion, and doubted the hypothesis because of Siward's Danish name.|$|E
500|$|Today this theory, {{as well as}} Lauer and Firths' conclusions, {{is widely}} questioned. Archaeological {{evidence}} of Peribsen has almost entirely been found in Upper Egypt. In particular, his name {{does not appear in}} Lower Egyptian records surviving from that time. It is argued that Peribsen may not have ruled over all of Egypt and therefore did not have the authority to force a change in state religion. Another piece of evidence that argues against the [...] "heretic Peribsen" [...] theory is the false door of the priest Shery at Saqqara. Shery held office during the early Fourth dynasty. The inscription on the false door connects the name of Peribsen in one sentence with another shadowy king of the Second dynasty, Senedj. According to the addendum, Shery was [...] "overseer of all wab-priests of king Peribsen in the necropolis of king Senedj, in his mortuary temple and at all other places". This implies that the funerary cult of Peribsen continued at least until the Fourth dynasty, inconsistent with the assumption that Peribsen's name was not allowed to be mentioned. Additionally, Egyptologists such as Herman te Velde point out that Shery was not the only Fourth dynasty priest participating in the funerary cult of Peribsen. Inkef, possibly <b>a</b> <b>brother</b> <b>or</b> cousin of Shery, also held the title of a [...] "supervisor of Ka-priests of Peribsen".|$|E

2500|$|The heiress {{of the old}} Kurki {{family of}} Niemenpää married {{sometime}} in the late 14th century a nobleman named Herman, of either Swedish or German extraction and using the nickname Svärd, [...] "sword", in accordance with his coat of arms.

2500|$|Little as he {{was known}} to the white {{inhabitants}} of Lexington, Jackson was revered by many of the African Americans in town, both slaves and free blacks. In 1855, he was instrumental in the organization of Sunday School classes for blacks at the Presbyterian Church. His second wife, Mary Anna Jackson, taught with Jackson, as [...] "he preferred that my labors should be given to the colored children, believing that it was more important and useful to put the strong hand of the Gospel under the ignorant African race, to lift them up." [...] The pastor, Dr. William Spottswood White, described the relationship between Jackson and his Sunday afternoon students: [...] "In their religious instruction he succeeded wonderfully. His discipline was systematic and firm, but very kind. ... His servants reverenced and loved him, as they would have done <b>a</b> <b>brother</b> <b>or</b> father. ... He was emphatically the black man's friend." [...] He addressed his students by name and they, in turn, referred to him affectionately as [...] "Marse Major".|$|E
2500|$|Roberto {{opted for}} {{surgery at the}} end of 1975 in order to prolong his life.

[...] They decided [...] "...that we would store some sperm just in case I didn't get pregnant before Roberto died. I knew he had only a few months to live, so we stored some sperm immediately." [...] Roberto died in March 1976, aged 31. Despite initial opposition from the medical profession she underwent several treatments of artificial insemination at a Cambridge clinic, and gave birth to son Milo Roberto Andrea sixteen months later, on 10 July 1977. She said at the time: [...] "Roberto and I were very anxious to provide <b>a</b> <b>brother</b> <b>or</b> sister to our two sons. Now, thanks to the care and patience of the doctors, it has been made possible for me to have another reminder of my wonderful husband." [...] British newspapers called Milo the [...] "miracle baby".

Parents: Kim and the late Roberto (posthumously by artificial insemination)".|$|E
2500|$|The {{relation}} of this Halfdan with other Danish rulers is also uncertain. An 812 {{entry in the}} Royal Frankish Annals mentions [...] "Anulo nepos Herioldi". The Latin [...] "nepos" [...] can be translated as both [...] "grandson" [...] or [...] "nephew", making Anulo and his siblings grandsons or nephews of a senior Harald. This would make Halfdan <b>a</b> <b>brother</b> <b>or</b> son of this Harald. The Frankish Annals vaguely mention this elder Harald as king. In Frisian history it is mentioned, that their king Redbad II (the last king of the Frisians) in 754 had to flee to [...] "the land of the Danes" [...] where king Harald reigned ("Daniae Regi Heraldi"). Also, a King Sigifrid (Siegfried) is mentioned in 777, granting refuge to the Saxon duke Widukind. In 782, an emissary {{by the name of}} Halfdan was sent by Sigifrid to Charlemagne. The last mention of Sigifrid in the Annals is in 798, when Charlemagne sent an envoy to him. In 804, Gudfred is mentioned as King of the Danes, exchanging envoys with Charlemagne. [...] Harald could be related to Sigifrid and Gudfred. His reign occurring between 798 and 804 are placed prior to that of Sigifrid. The time and extent of the rule of these earlier kings are uncertain, but the area they ruled presumably included the region closest to the Frankish realm, i.e. around Hedeby. Although they are historical figures insofar as that they are mentioned in historical sources, the details of their rule mostly belong to the realm of the legendary Danish kings.|$|E

2500|$|Leonard Woolf {{wrote about}} Sackville-West, who, as an aristocrat, {{came from a}} very {{different}} world than {{he and his wife}} : [...] "She [...] belonged indeed to a world which was completely different from ours, and the long line of Sackvilles, Dorsets, Da La Warrs and Knole with its 365 rooms had put into her mind and heart an ingredient which was alien to us and at first made intimacy difficult". While Sackville-West was visiting Nicholson in Tehran, Woolf wrote to her: [...] "Then there's my character (you see how egoistical I am, for I only answer questions that are about myself), I agree with the lack of jolly vulgarity. But then think about how I was brought up! No school, mooning about alone among my father's books, never a chance to pick up all that goes on in the schools-throwing balls: ragging: slang: vulgarity: scenes: jealousies: only rages with my half brothers and being walked off my legs round the Serpentine by my father". In her reply, Sackville-West wrote: [...] "But indeed, my upbringing wasn't so different from yours: I move about too, at Knole mostly, and haven't had <b>a</b> <b>brother</b> <b>or</b> sister to knock the corners off me. And I never went to school. If I am jolly and vulgar, you can cry quits on another count, for you have that interest in humanity which I can never manage-at least I have the interest, but not the diabolical skill in its practice which is yours. As I get older...I get more and more disagreeably solitary". Besides for having similar childhoods, both women had grown up with a profound sense of the weight of English history as Woolf's father Sir Leslie Stephen had been a leading contributor to The Dictionary of National Biography while Sackville-West had grown up at Knole House, one of the grand country houses of England. Likewise, Sackville-West had felt torn between her Spanish heritage which contrasted with the English grandeur she had been brought up in at Knole House while Woolf felt torn between the [...] "sobriety" [...] of her father's family vs. the [...] "flamboyance" [...] of her mother's family.|$|E
