5|$|Murasaki is {{best known}} for her The Tale of Genji, a three-part novel {{spanning}} 1100 pages and 54 chapters, which is thought to have taken <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>to</b> complete. The earliest chapters were possibly written for a private patron either during her marriage or shortly after her husband's death. She continued writing while at court and probably finished while still in service to Shōshi. She would have needed patronage to produce a work of such length. Michinaga provided her with costly paper and ink, and with calligraphers. The first handwritten volumes were probably assembled and bound by ladies-in-waiting.|$|E

5|$|Enlisting in the Union Navy in 1864, {{he served}} as sailor aboard the USS Vandalia and the {{captured}} Confederate vessel USS Beauregard, maintaining the blockade of the ports of the Confederacy. He was discharged from service in 1865 after receiving an injury, which developed into a chronic condition in later life. Unable to immediately return home, the impoverished Bush took more than <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>to</b> return to Hawaii, journeying through New England {{and much of the}} Pacific. Back in Hawaii, he worked as a government tax collector and road supervisor for the island of Kauai, where he settled down.

After the annexation of Hawaii to the United States, Bush was recognized for his service and granted a government pension in 1905 for the injuries he received in the Navy. He died at his home on Kauai, on April 24, 1906.|$|E
5|$|A keep (from the Middle English kype) {{is a type}} of {{fortified}} tower built within castles {{during the}} Middle Ages by European nobility. Scholars have debated the scope of the word keep, but usually consider it to refer to large towers in castles that were fortified residences, used as a refuge of last resort should the rest of the castle fall to an adversary. The first keeps were made of timber and formed {{a key part of the}} motte-and-bailey castles that emerged in Normandy and Anjou during the 10th century; the design spread to England as a result of the Norman invasion of 1066, and in turn spread into Wales during the second half of the 11th century and into Ireland in the 1170s. The Anglo-Normans and French rulers began to build stone keeps during the 10th and 11th centuries; these included Norman keeps, with a square or rectangular design, and circular shell keeps. Stone keeps carried considerable political as well as military importance and could take up to <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>to</b> build.|$|E

The band performed at London's Hard Rock Cafe in February 2007 to promote their European tour which included a night in Hyde Park {{as part of the}} Hyde Park Calling festival sponsored by Hard Rock Cafe. In the spring, the band toured Latin America to sold-out stadium crowds. In the summer, the band toured Europe, performing at several major rock festivals and visiting some countries they had never played before. Additionally, the band played in Middle East countries such as the United Arab Emirates and India for the first time. The band also played a few select dates in California and Canada in late July. The July 21 concert in Prince Edward Island, was the largest in that province's history. In September, the band performed eight dates in major markets in Northeastern North America. These shows were opened by Joan Jett. The band also played a private gig in Hawaii. A public show in Maui was canceled for logistical reasons, which spurred a class action lawsuit against the band. In April 2009, Aerosmith agreed to compensate all ticket buyers of the canceled show with a free ticket to a rescheduled Maui show to be held on October 20, 2009, along with reimbursements of all out-of-pocket expenses related to the show.|$|E
