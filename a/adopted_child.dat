25|$|The <b>adopted</b> <b>child</b> can {{be either}} male or female. The <b>adopted</b> <b>child</b> must fall under the Hindu category. The adoptee {{also needs to be}} unmarried; however, if the {{particular}} custom or usage is applicable to the involved parties then the adoptee can be married. The child cannot be the age of sixteen or older, unless again it is custom or the usage is applicable to the involved parties. An adoption can only occur if there is not a child of the same sex of the <b>adopted</b> <b>child</b> still residing in the home. In particular, if a son were to be adopted then the adoptive father or mother must not have a legitimate or adopted son still living in the house.|$|E
25|$|Adoption {{had to be}} with {{consent of}} the natural parents, who usually {{executed}} a deed making over the child, who thus ceased to have any claim upon them. But vestals, hierodules, certain palace officials and slaves had no rights over their children and could raise no objection. Orphans and illegitimate children had no parents to object. Ingratitude by adopted children was severely frowned on by the law: if the <b>adopted</b> <b>child</b> of a prostitute abandoned his foster parents {{and returned to his}} biological father's house, his eye was torn out. If an <b>adopted</b> <b>child</b> rejected his foster parents, claiming they were not his mother and father, his tongue was torn out. An <b>adopted</b> <b>child</b> was a full heir; the contract might even assign him the position of eldest son. Usually, he was residuary legatee.|$|E
25|$|Adoption {{was very}} common, {{especially}} when the father (or mother) was childless or had seen all his children grow up and marry away. The child was then adopted {{to care for the}} parents' old age. This was done by contract, which usually specified what the parent had to leave and what maintenance was expected. The natural children, if any, were usually consenting parties to an arrangement that cut off their expectations. In some cases they even acquired the estate for the <b>adopted</b> <b>child</b> who was to relieve them of care. If the <b>adopted</b> <b>child</b> failed to carry out the filial duty, the contract was annulled in the law courts. Slaves were often adopted, and if they proved unfilial, were reduced to slavery again.|$|E
40|$|In the {{adoption}} process, adoptive parents and <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> need to transform from strangers {{to each other}} into family members. The forming of a parent-child relationship that is trustworthy and safe is crucial for the adjustment of <b>adopted</b> <b>children.</b> Positive family relationships are important {{for the development of}} children’s’ personal identity and are protective factors in relation to problem behavior. This study examined the relationship between parental, child and family factors and the involvement of <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> with their adoptive family. Informants were adoptive parents of 982 Chinese adoptees in The Netherlands, aged 3 to 16 years. The child-rearing context of adoptive families with and without biological children differed on family size, age at adoption, adopted children’s interest in adoption, parent’s close bond with their <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> and the time adoptive parents spent with their <b>adopted</b> <b>children.</b> <b>Adopted</b> <b>children</b> without siblings in the adoptive family were less involved with their adoptive families compared to <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> that have been raised together with other children in the family. In both all-adoptive families and families with <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> and biological <b>children,</b> <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> were more involved with their adoptive families if parents reported a closer bond with their <b>adopted</b> <b>children.</b> Another finding was that the more parents got along with their <b>adopted</b> <b>children,</b> the more involved their <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> were with their adoptive family. In conclusion, a good preparation of future adoptive parents about their responsibility as a parent and educater is desirable, as well as a warm and accepting parenting style, to form strong family tie...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the number}} of <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> with special needs in the Netherlands has increased, while {{the total number of}} <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> has declined. Because of this shift, {{adoption}} agency Meiling requested an exploratory study on the welfare of <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> with special needs. In this study parents of <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> from Taiwan have been questioned by using a digital questionnaire. The research question of this thesiswas: “Are there differences in the care of <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> from Taiwan with and without special ?” To answer this question, the Leiden classification of special needs was used to specify the special needs. This classification focuses on physical/medical impairments of children. This resulted in two groups: 131 <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> with special needs and 179 children without special needs. The results of this study showed that <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> with special needs were more likely to show developmental delays than <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> without special needs, both when they were placed for adoption and {{at the time of the}} study. Also, <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> with special needs used more guidance and support from different agencies, such as physiotherapy, remedial teaching, speech therapy, and health care than <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> without special needs. <b>Adopted</b> <b>children</b> with special needs attended special education more frequently and/or needed more additional adjustments in school than <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> without special needs. Adoptive parents of children with special needs used health insurance, provided additional funding themselves, and received a personal budget (PGB) more often than adoptive parents of children without special needs. When <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> with special needs from Taiwan were compared with <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> with special needs from China (N = 189), the results showed that they did not differ in developmental delays at the time of placement nor at the moment of the study. However, adoptive parents of children with special needs from Taiwan more frequently used physical therapy, education and support around temporary assistance / care. From these findings, recommendations for practice are made, such as providing maternity care after the adoption, better collaboration between different agencies, specializing in <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> with special needs by professionals and long-term follow-up care for <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> with medical problems, possibly leading to developmental delay. Finally, it is concluded that further research is necessary to gain information about the development of <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> with special needs.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} number of {{foreign-born}} <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> with Special Needs. Despite this increase little is known about these <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> and their needs. It is important to find answers to the following questions: 1. Are there differences between <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> from Taiwan with Special Needs and <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> from Taiwan without Special Needs, concerning problem behavior? 2. Are there differences between <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> from Taiwan and <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> from China, concerning problem behavior? 3. Are there differences between <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> from Taiwan with Special Needs and <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> from China with Special Needs, concerning problem behavior? Through sending adoptive parents questionnaires, data was obtained from 310 <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> from Taiwan. These data were compared with data from a comparison group consisting of <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> from China (N = 1233). Problem behavior was studied with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). There were differences between girls with Special Needs from Taiwan and girls without Special Needs from Taiwan: the girls with Special Needs tended to have more problems with peers (SDQ), to have more internalizing problems (CBCL) and more total problem behavior (CBCL) than the girls without Special Needs. Boys with Special Needs from Taiwan also showed more internalizing problems (CBCL) than boys without Special Needs from Taiwan. Although „Special Needs‟ is considered to be something purely physical, both boys and girls with Special Needs showed more internalizing problems than children without Special Needs. It may be a pitfall to focus help only on the physical problems when helping <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> with Special Needs. Besides that, girls from Taiwan (with and without Special Needs) showed more problem behavior on several problem scales than the girls from China. Similarly, girls with Special Needs from Taiwan showed more problems (according to the SDQ) than girls with Special Needs from China. This means that extra attention should be given to problem behavior from girls from Taiwan...|$|R

30|$|The {{sampling}} plan {{of this study}} was to investigate the parents and <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> relationship in terms of attachment behaviors the parents endure while <b>adopting</b> a <b>child</b> from fosterage community. Survey is used to collect the relevant data from large sample of the population (McIntyre 1999, p. 74). The data was collected through focus groups from the respondents (<b>adopted</b> <b>children)</b> of two Eastern (Pakistan and China) and two western countries (United States and United Kingdom). The survey was designed for parents and <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> relationships in terms of four constructs of attachments: Secure, Avoidant, Ambivalent and Disorganized attachments. The method used included 60 focus groups having 8 <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> (ages 11 - 18  yrs.) in each group, having the sample size of 1920 respondents. Most of the focus groups had equal number of males and females <b>adopted</b> <b>children,</b> (1 focus group[*]=[*] 4 male children and 4 female children) but 18 focus groups had random number of males and females <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> for e.g. 6 : 2 male: female; 3 : 5 male: female. The male parents of all the <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> were all working parents and the female parents of all the <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> were working and non-working parents both. All the children were randomly picked for this research. These children have spent certain amount of time in the orphanage houses/foster homes but we didn’t focus on the duration of the time spent by these children with the foster homes as that was not included in the focus of our research but it was evident by talking to these children that they were aware that they do have their real parents and their new parents are adopting them because they wish to have a family which is only complete when husband and wife becomes parents of child.|$|R

However, these studies were severely limited by the paucity of data on the <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> {{and a lack of}} information on the biological parents of adoptees. To overcome these issues, the literature has recently made use of large registry datasets of <b>adopted</b> <b>children,</b> which are available in the Nordic countries. In their study, Björklund et al. (2006) improve on the previous literature by employing a unique administrative dataset of Swedish adoptees that allowed them to examine the impact of both the adoptive and biological parents’ years of schooling on the <b>adopted</b> <b>child’s</b> years of schooling. They find both the adoptive and the biological parents’ education to be important. Overall, studies on <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> emphasize the importance of both genetic and environmental factors for a child’s success in school.|$|R
25|$|The {{limitations}} {{based on}} consanguinity derive from {{a policy of}} practical eugenics and reflect the increased possibility that such marriages will produce children {{with a genetic defect}} due to the limitations on their combined gene pool. The limitations based on affinity, by contrast, are predominantly legal and social in origin. The rules relating to affinity reflect the need to minimise the prospects of familial jealousies and dysfunction by preventing the intermarriage of people already related by marriage. Difficult questions arise on whether an <b>adopted</b> <b>child</b> may marry his or her adoptive parents, or the natural children of the adoptive parents. No matter what legislative decisions are taken, there will always be citizens who wish to evade the application of the law. There will be no problem if they relocate and establish a matrimonial home in a state that allows their marriage. But any attempt to evade such laws by going through a ceremony in a state that permits the marriage and then returning to the original state (which will usually be their state of domicile, nationality or habitual residence) will fail, and may even expose the couple to the risk of prosecution for incest or an equivalent offense.|$|E
