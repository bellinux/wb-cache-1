40|$|Abstract. All of the {{experiments}} performed on friction welding combinations of 304 SS and mild steel are modeled using the ABAQUS code and the Johnson-cook equation is used to define coupled thermo-mechanical properties of materials. The variations of temperature, von-Mises stress, plastic strain, and strain rate during continuous welding are systematically investigated and analyzed. The calculated results of temperature distribution are in good agreement with the infrared detected ones. The numerically calculated results for {{the shape of the}} welded joint <b>also</b> show <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>fit</b> with experimental observations.

40|$|In the {{simplest}} form of signal-detection theory (SDT), all stimuli {{give rise to}} equalvariance Gaussian probability-density functions (PDFs) of sensation, with means proportional to stimulus intensity. As this simple SDT cannot accurately describe psychometric functions for two-alternative forced-choice (2 AFC) detection experiments, it is commonly modified {{in one of two}} ways: with a non-linear transducer or intrinsic uncertainty. Most results can adequately be explained by either modification, but Swets et al. ’s (1961) two-response 4 AFC (2 R 4 AFC) detection experiment is an exception. Simple SDT cannot predict the relationship between first- and second-response accuracies and non-linear transduction does not help.

40|$|In {{a recent}} report [Sun, Science 312, 1119 (2006) ], the {{partially}} filled material inside multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) was shown to have shrunk and deformed in the axial direction under 300 kV electron irradiation. In this experiment, 100 MeV Au 7 + ion irradiation was performed to study the deformation and defects in uniformly nickel filled MWNTs with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. We propose that high-pressure induced torsion in confined nickel could possibly result in successive compressions and expansions of the tubes, leading to axial buckling of MWNTs. The tangential Raman G band systematically upshifts as the ion fluence increases, attributed to the torsional strain. In contrast to a square root dependence of the buckling wavelength (lambda) on the radius (r) and thickness (t) of the tubes [lambda= 3. 5 (rt) (1 / 2) ], as predicted by theoretical models, the exponential fit of the data that assumes lambda proportional to e(root(r/t)) <b>also</b> produces <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>fit...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{key feature}} of {{directed}} cell movement {{is the ability}} of cells to reorient quickly in response to changes in the direction of an extracellular stimulus. Mathematical models have suggested quite different regulatory mechanisms to explain reorientation, raising the question of how we can validate these models in a rigorous way. In this study, we fit three reaction-diffusion models to experimental data of Dictyostelium amoebae reorienting in response to alternating gradients of mechanical shear flow. The experimental readouts we use to fit are spatio-temporal distributions of a fluorescent reporter for cortical F-actin labeling the cell front. Experiments performed under different conditions are fitted simultaneously to challenge the models with different types of cellular dynamics. Although the model proposed by Otsuji is unable to provide a satisfactory fit, those suggested by Meinhardt and Levchenko fit equally well. Further, we show that reduction of the three-variable Meinhardt model to <b>a</b> two-variable model <b>also</b> provides <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>fit,</b> but has the advantage of all parameters being uniquely identifiable. Our work demonstrates that model selection and identifiability analysis, commonly applied to temporal dynamics problems in systems biology, can be a powerful tool when extended to spatio-temporal imaging data. © 2014 The Authors.

40|$|Using the {{combined}} spectral and spatial resolving {{power of the}} Low Energy Transmission Grating (LETGS) on board Chandra, we obtain separate spectra from the bright central source of NGC 1068 (Primary region), and from a fainter bright spot 4 " to the NE (Secondary region). Both spectra are dominated by line emission from H- and He-like ions of C through S, and from Fe L-shell ions, but also include narrow radiative recombination continua, indicating {{that most of the}} soft X-ray emission arises in low-temperature (kT few eV) photoionized plasma. We confirm the conclusions of Kinkhabwala et al. (2002), based on XMM-Newton RGS observations, that the entire nuclear spectrum can be explained by recombination/radiative cascade following photoionization, and radiative decay following photoexcitation, with no evidence for hot, collisionally ionized plasma. In addition, this model <b>also</b> provides <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>fit</b> to the spectrum of the Secondary region, albeit with radial column densities a factor of three lower, as would be expected given its distance from the source of the ionizing continuum. The remarkable overlap and kinematical agreement of the optical and X-ray line emission, coupled with the need for a distribution of ionization parameter to explain the X-ray spectra, collectively imply the presence of a distribution of densities (over a few orders of magnitude) at each radius in the ionization cone. Relative abundances of all elements are consistent with Solar abundance, except for N, which is 2 - 3 times Solar. The long wavelength spectrum beyond 30 A is rich of L-shell transitions of Mg, Si, S, and Ar, and M-shell transitions of Fe. The velocity dispersion decreases with increasing ionization parameter, as deduced from these long wavelength lines and the Fe-L shell lines.
