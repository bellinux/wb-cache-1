40|$|International audiencePICARD is a French space {{scientific}} mission. Its {{objectives are}} {{the study of}} the origin of the solar variability and {{the study of the}} relations between the Sun and the Earth's climate. The Satellite was successfully launched, on June 15, 2010 on a DNEPR launcher from Dombarovskiy Cosmodrome, near Yasny (Russia). The payload consists in two absolute radiometers measuring the total solar irradiance and an imaging telescope to determine the solar diameter and asphericity. SODISM (SOlar Diameter Imager and Surface Mapper) is a 11 cm Ritchey-Chretien imaging telescope associated with a CCD, taking solar images at five wavelengths. It carries a four-prism system to ensure a metrological control of the optics magnification. The first image of the Sun with this new instrument was taken on July 22, 2010. A mechanism of this instrument is the subject of the presentation. Current and future space telescope mission require ever-higher dimensionally stable structures. CNRS aims to design, manufacture and test a very high dimensional stability telescope for precision optical systems using advanced materials combining high dimensional stability and good structural performance. To achieve these accurate measurements, SODISM includes a <b>fine</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> based on the piezoelectric technology. This paper covers the description of the SODISM instrument, the design and the qualification of the <b>pointing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and the flight results (commissioning phase and in orbit validation phase) ...|$|R
40|$|Tohoku University is {{developing}} a 50 kg-class international scientific microsatellite named RISESAT. In addition to various scientific instruments including a 5 m GSD multi-spectral high-precision Cassegrain telescope (HPT), RISESAT is also equipped with a laser communication terminal VSOTA, developed by Japanese National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) as technology demonstration mission. VSOTA stands for Very Small Optical Transmitter for Component Validation, which is a dual-band (980 nm/ 1550 nm) laser signal transmitter without gimbal <b>mechanism</b> or internal <b>fine</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> RISESAT aims to demonstrate satellite-to-ground laser communication by means of accurate attitude control of the satellite body, i. e. {{the direction of the}} laser beams fixed to the satellite structure, with an attitude control accuracy of down to 0. 04 deg (3 σ). Moreover, it is planned that the HPT is utilized to determine the direction of the pilot signal sent from the ground station, which can be fed back to the attitude control system for achieving higher control accuracy. The desired maximum bitrate for this mission is 1 Mbps. The NICT’s 1. 5 m diameter optical ground station is the primary ground station, supported by 0. 3 m diameter mobile optical ground stations. This {{is the first step toward}} the establishment of future optical communication infrastructures...|$|R
40|$|The <b>fine</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the Acquisition, Pointing and Tracking (APT) {{system in}} free space laser {{communication}} usually use four-quadrant detector (QD) to point and track the laser beam accurately. The positioning precision of QD {{is one of}} the key factors of the pointing accuracy to APT system. A positioning system is designed based on FPGA and DSP in this paper, which can realize the sampling of AD, the positioning algorithm and the control of the fast swing mirror. We analyze the positioning error of facular center calculated by universal algorithm when the facular energy obeys Gauss distribution from the working principle of QD. A database is built by calculation and simulation with MatLab software, in which the facular center calculated by universal algorithm is corresponded with the facular center of Gaussian beam, and the database is stored in two pieces of E 2 PROM as the external memory of DSP. The facular center of Gaussian beam is inquiry in the database on the basis of the facular center calculated by universal algorithm in DSP. The experiment results show that the positioning accuracy of the high-precision positioning system is much better than the positioning accuracy calculated by universal algorithm. © 2015 SPIE...|$|R
30|$|Considering the {{interaction}} of the various sub-systems in determining pointing performance is a significant systems engineering challenge spanning all parties and disciplines. There are several potential sources of pointing error either leading to low frequency biases or high frequency noise in the transmitted beam direction. Low frequency drift will misalign the telescope bore axis from the OGS direction and if left unchecked could bring the deviation outside of the angular limits of the BSM. As long as the coarse pointing system can keep the optical boresight to within these limits, the final pointing performance will be determined mainly by the <b>fine</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This will be mainly impacted by high frequency noise leading to jitter or beam wandering. A high optical OBT detection bandwidth is essential for rejecting this source of noise. Noise with higher frequency components than the OBT frame rate can be tackled by the IMUs and blended rate sensor fusion to compensate for any motion occurring in-between frames of the OBT [69, 70]. Quantum communication experiments have achieved a few μrad accuracy under demanding conditions such as in a propeller driven airplane [3] or lofted on a hot air balloon [8]. The more benign microgravity environment and lower vibrational background of a space-based experiment should allow at least as good performance and we consider residual effects that may affect pointing performance.|$|R

40|$|On ITALSAT Flight 2, the Italian {{telecommunications}} satellite, the two L-Ka antennas (Tx and Rx) use {{two large}} deployable reflectors (2000 -mm diameter), whose deployment and <b>fine</b> <b>pointing</b> functions are accomplished {{by means of}} an innovative mechanism concept. The Antenna Deployment & <b>Pointing</b> <b>Mechanism</b> and Supporting Structure (ADPMSS) is based on a new configuration solution, where the reflector and mechanisms are conceived as an integrated, self-contained assembly. This approach is different from the traditional configuration solution. Typically, a rigid arm is used to deploy and then support the reflector in the operating position, and an Antenna <b>Pointing</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (APM) is normally interposed between the reflector and the arm for steering operation. The main characteristics of the ADPMSS are: combined implementation of deployment, pointing, and reflector support; optimum integration of active components and interface matching with the satellite platform; structural link distribution to avoid hyperstatic connections; very light weight and; high performance in terms of deployment torque margin and pointing range/accuracy. After having successfully been subjected to all component-level qualification and system-level acceptance tests, two flight ADPMSS mechanisms (one for each antenna) are now integrated on ITALSAT F 2 and are ready for launch. This paper deals with the design concept, development, and testing program performed to qualify the ADPMSS mechanism...|$|R
