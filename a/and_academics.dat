40|$|Objectives: The {{relationship}} between physical fitness <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement in children has received much attention, however, whether executive functioning plays a mediating {{role in this}} relationship is unclear. The {{aim of this study}} therefore was to investigate the relationships between physical fitness, executive functioning, <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement, more specifically to test whether the {{relationship between}} physical fitness <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement is direct or indirect, via executive functioning. Design: Cross-sectional. Method: This study examined 263 children (145 boys, 118 girls), aged 7 - 12 years, who performed tests on physical fitness, executive functioning, <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement. Results: In a structural equation model linking physical fitness to executive functioning <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement there was a significant relationship between physical fitness and executive functioning (r =. 43, R- 2 =. 19) <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement (r =. 33, R- 2 =. 11). Adding a relationship from executive functioning to academic achievement resulted in a non-significant direct link between physical fitness <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement (r = -. 08, R- 2 =. 006). However, a significant indirect relation through executive functioning persisted. The indirect relation between fitness <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement (r =. 41), was stronger than both the direct and total relation (r =. 33). Conclusion: Executive functioning thus served as a mediator in the relation between physical fitness <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement. This highlights the importance of including executive functioning when studying the relationship between physical fitness <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement in children. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

African American college students (N = 95) attending a PWI completed the following measures: (a) demographic form; (b) Cross Racial Identity Scale (Vandiver et al., 2002); (c) Societal, Attitudinal, Familial, and Environmental Acculturation Stress Scale (Mena, Padilla, 2 ̆ 6 Maldonado, 1987); (d) Index of Race-Related Stress-Brief Version (Utsey, 1999); and (e) Institutional Integration Scale (Pascarella 2 ̆ 6 Terenzini, 1980). Two standard multiple regressions tested the following eight hypotheses: (a) pre-encounter pro-American racial identity will positively predict social <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> integration; (b) pre-encounter miseducation racial identity will negatively predict social <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> integration; (c) pre-encounter self-hatred racial identity will negatively predict social <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> integration; (d) immersion-emersion anti-White racial identity will negatively predict social <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> integration; (e) internalization Afrocentricity racial identity will negatively predict social <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> integration; (f) internalization multiculturalist inclusive will positively predict social <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> integration; (g) acculturative stress will negatively predict social <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> integration; <b>and</b> (h) cultural racism and individual racism will negatively predict social <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> integration.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the mixed method {{study was to examine}} the {{relationship}} between factors of graduate student engagement <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement at a historically black college and university (HBCU). The independent variables were graduate student safety in the learning environment, graduate student to graduate student relationships, graduate student to faculty relationships, graduate students’ self-efficacy, graduate students’ motivation, graduate students’ faculty mentoring, graduate students’ integration, graduate students’ study habits, and graduate students’ use of technology. Qualitatively, correlational research was used to examine the extent of the relationship between independent variables <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement. Qualitatively, the phenomenological approach was used to investigate graduate student perceptions of engagement factors <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement. The mixed method helped analyze the convergence between qualitative and quantitative data. Miller and Cameron (2011) found that the mixed method of research has been used widely and accepted in the field of Education. The quantitative data were collected from 209 graduate students. The data content validity was checked with the Pearson r 2 -tailed correlation. The Pearson Correlation helped to test for a significant relationship between variables. Qualitative data were collected from the interviews of two graduate students from four different graduate departments equaling eight interview participants. One focus group with a minimum of three graduates was conducted from four different departments. A total of 16 graduate students participated in the focus groups. The researcher interpreted the statements from the interviews and focus groups and conducted a document analysis revealing codes and themes that were organized into an analysis matrix. The findings revealed that there was a significant relationship between graduate students’ safety in the learning environment <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement. There was a significant relationship between graduate student to student relationships <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement. There was a significant relationship between (a) graduate student to faculty relationships <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement, (b) graduate students’ self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement, (c) graduate students’ motivation <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement, (d) graduate students’ faculty mentoring <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement, (e) graduate students’ integration <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement, (f) graduate students’ study habits <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement, <b>and</b> (g) graduate students’ use of technology <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement...|$|R

In The Journal of American Historys review of the first edition, Loren Schweninger commended King's restrained use of the WPA sources with Neal’s same rationale. Schweninger also sought more comparisons between Southern regions and in interracial relationships. Jane Turner Censer agreed that the book treated the South and century too broadly where it could have noticed specific differences due to migration patterns, regional changes, and time. Richard H. Steckel in The Georgia Historical Quarterly similarly desired comparison between slave and working class children of the era. Yet Roderick A. McDonald appreciated this broader perspective and emphasis on slave resilience and familial love in foil with two more negative and detailed, or narrower, studies (Them Dark Days by William Dusinberre and Life in Black and White by Brenda Stevenson) in his write-up for American Studies. Steckel added {{that he wanted to}} know more about the children's nutrition, and Marten felt several of King's smaller points were not fully substantiated.|$|E
