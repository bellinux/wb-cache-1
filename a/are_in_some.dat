5|$|According to the United States Census Bureau, {{there are}} an {{estimated}} 5,045,356 houses in Ohio, of which 4,499,506, or about 89.2% are estimated to be occupied; this is 0.8% above the national average rate of occupation. Houses with a mortgage are estimated to cost owners about $1,216 per month, which is $186 below the national average. The United States Census Bureau also estimates that 3,150,239 houses are owner-occupied, or about 70%, which is 2.7% above the national average, and that an estimated 1,349,267 houses are renter-occupied. The median house value is $135,200, which is a significant $50,000 below the national average. Also, {{there are an}} estimated 545,850 unoccupied houses. It is also {{interesting to note that the}} plurality of houses in Ohio were built from 1940 to 1959 (1,175,325 houses), and that 3,058,721 houses <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> way dependent on utility gas.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'í teachings <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> ways {{similar to}} other monotheistic faiths: God is {{considered}} single and all-powerful. However, Bahá'u'lláh taught that religion is orderly and progressively revealed by one God through Manifestations of God who are the founders of major world religions throughout history; Buddha, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad being the most recent in the period before the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh. As such, Bahá'ís regard the major religions as fundamentally unified in purpose, though varied in social practices and interpretations. There is a similar emphasis on the unity of all people, openly rejecting notions of racism and nationalism. At the heart of Bahá'í teachings {{is the goal of}} a unified world order that ensures the prosperity of all nations, races, creeds, and classes.|$|E
5|$|Dualism {{is a set}} {{of views}} about the {{relationship}} between mind and matter (or body). It begins with the claim that mental phenomena <b>are,</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> respects, non-physical. One of the earliest known formulations of mind–body dualism was expressed in the eastern Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy (c. 650 BCE), which divided the world into purusha (mind/spirit) and prakriti (material substance). Specifically, the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali presents an analytical approach {{to the nature of the}} mind.|$|E

5|$|Starfish <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> cases {{taken from}} their habitat {{and sold to}} {{tourists}} as souvenirs, ornaments, curios or for display in aquariums. In particular, Oreaster reticulatus, with its easily accessed habitat and conspicuous coloration, is widely collected in the Caribbean. In the early to mid 20th century, this species was common along the coasts of the West Indies, but collection and trade have severely reduced its numbers. In the State of Florida, O. reticulatus is listed as endangered and its collection is illegal. Nevertheless, it is still sold throughout its range and beyond. A similar phenomenon exists in the Indo-Pacific for species such as Protoreaster nodosus.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples {{recognized}} {{the urgent need}} to respect and promote the rights of indigenous peoples affirmed in treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements with States. It {{also noted that the}} rights affirmed in treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements between States and indigenous peoples <b>are,</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> situations, matters of international concern, interest, responsibility and character. In many instances the minority rights treaties provided for arbitration and granted the International Court of Justice jurisdiction to resolve disputes.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtyard}} {{house is}} {{the most common type of}} home portrayed in Han artwork. Ceramic architectural models of buildings, like houses and towers, were found in Han tombs, perhaps to provide lodging for the dead in the afterlife. These provide valuable clues about lost wooden architecture. The artistic designs found on ceramic roof tiles of tower models <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> cases exact matches to Han roof tiles found at archaeological sites.|$|E

5|$|The river martins <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> ways {{intermediate}} between typical swallows {{and other}} passerines: they have stout bills, large feet and relatively strong legs, which {{is unusual in}} aerial feeders. They also have a large syrinx (vocal organ) and a different bronchial structure. The extent of their differences from other swallows and the wide geographical separation of these two martins suggest that they are relict populations {{of a group of}} species that diverged from the main swallow lineage early in its evolutionary history, and they may be the most primitive of the swallows. Like other early hirundine lineages, they nest in burrows, rather than adopted nest holes or mud nests.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{elephants}} in such fashion {{went beyond the}} common royal power to dispense life and death. Elephants have long been used as symbols of royal authority (and still <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> places, such as Thailand, where white elephants are held in reverence). Their use as instruments of state power sent {{the message that the}} ruler was able to preside over very powerful creatures who were under total command. The ruler was thus seen as maintaining a moral and spiritual domination over wild beasts, adding to their authority and mystique among subjects.|$|E
5|$|Directed pseudoforests and endo{{function}}s <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> sense mathematically equivalent. Any function ƒ from a set X {{to itself}} (that is, an endomorphism of X) {{can be interpreted}} as defining a directed pseudoforest which has an edge from x to y whenever ƒ(x) = y. The resulting directed pseudoforest is maximal, and may include self-loops whenever some value x has ƒ(x) = x. Alternatively, omitting the self-loops produces a non-maximal pseudoforest. In the other direction, any maximal directed pseudoforest determines a function ƒ such that ƒ(x) is the target of the edge that goes out from x, and any non-maximal directed pseudoforest can be made maximal by adding self-loops and then converted into a function in the same way. For this reason, maximal directed pseudoforests are sometimes called functional graphs. Viewing a function as a functional graph provides a convenient language for describing properties that are not as easily described from the function-theoretic point of view; this technique is especially applicable to problems involving iterated functions, which correspond to paths in functional graphs.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies have}} focused on changes of anthropometrical (body weight, BMI, WHR,…) or {{biochemical}} parameters (mostly plasma lipid levels) {{as a result of the}} interactions between common APOA5 variants and dietary habits (polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, n-3 and n-6 fatty acid intake, total fat and total energy intake, alcohol intake), dietary (lowering the energy intake) and/or physical activity interventions or dyslipidaemic (using statins or fenofibrate) treatment. Due to the high heterogeneity of the examined populations, differences in protocol and/or interventions used, the studies are difficult to directly compare and draw definitive conclusions. However, with caution, it could be concluded that carriers of the minor C-1131, Trp19, or T553 alleles <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> cases less prone to the positive effects of environmental and/or pharmacological interventions. Some papers suggest the importance of the interactions between APOA5 and other genes, especially with common APOE (OMIM acc. No. 107741) three allelic (E2, E3, and E4) polymorphism, in the modulation of plasma lipids. In these cases, the interaction between minor alleles of both genes seems to be of importance. In the general population, APOE4 seems to have the potential to diminish the effect of minor APOA5 rs662799 and rs3135506 alleles, especially in females. Interaction between APOE and APOA5 Ser19˃Trp has been suggested to play some role in the development of type III hyperlipidaemia. Further studies, in which interaction with APOA5 has been described, have included, for example, variants within FTO, lipoprotein lipase, USF-1 and FEN-1. They have also focused not only on plasma lipids, but on BMI values or hypertension as well.|$|E
