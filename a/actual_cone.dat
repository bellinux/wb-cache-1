60|$|In {{the evening}} the {{schooner}} {{made for the}} volcano, about three miles off. It was a magnificent sight--a perfect cone, {{the base of the}} mountain and all except the <b>actual</b> <b>cone</b> being under water. The cone was apparently about 2,000 feet high, clouds hanging about it near the top, lurid and fiery, increasing the grandeur of the glow at the summit. Every minute streams of fire, falling from the top or sides, rushed down the mount, so that for a space of perhaps half a mile in breadth the whole cone was always streaked, and sometimes covered with burning-masses of stones, cinders, &c. Bumbling noises were heard only a few times.|$|E

5000|$|Pomerape is {{a complex}} of lava domes, {{accompanied}} by lava flows. It was active about 200,000 years ago.

50|$|A visual hull is a {{geometric}} entity {{created by}} shape-from-silhouette 3D reconstruction technique introduced by A. Laurentini. This technique assumes the foreground object in an image can {{be separated from}} the background. Under this assumption, the original image can be thresholded into a foreground/background binary image, which we call a silhouette image. The foreground mask, known as a silhouette, is the 2D projection of the corresponding 3D foreground object. Along with the camera viewing parameters, the silhouette defines a back-projected generalized cone that contains the <b>actual</b> object. This <b>cone</b> is called a silhouette cone. The upper right thumbnail shows two such cones produced from two silhouette images taken from different viewpoints. The intersection of the two cones is called a visual hull, which is a bounding geometry of the actual 3D object (see the bottom right thumbnail).|$|R

5000|$|The {{collapse}} event {{resembled the}} one that occurred on Mount St. Helens during the latter's eruption in 1988, although the Parinacota collapse was three times larger. A separate, minor sector collapse occurred on a lava dome on the southwestern foot of the volcano at an unknown time. Such sector collapses are a common phenomenon on volcanoes. The avalanche eventually came to rest in a large [...] "L" [...] with the long side extending along the axis of the collapse and the short side closer to the edifice pointing north, formed an exceptionally well preserved debris avalanche deposit. This deposit has a [...] "hummocky" [...] appearance typical for sector collapse deposits; individual hummocks can reach sizes of 400 - 500 m and heights of 80 m, with the size decreasing away from the volcano. The formation of these hummocks was probably influenced by the pre-existing structure of the edifice; much of the original stratigraphy of the pre-collapse edifice was preserved within the final collapse deposit. A few large Toreva blocks lie in the avalanche deposit just {{at the foot of}} Parinacota, they reach heights of 250 m and volumes of [...] Large blocks with sizes of up to 100 m are part of the deposit, and some of these blocks preserve details of the pre-collapse structure; the blocks reach sizes of 0.5 - 2 m even at large distance from Parinacota. These large blocks dominate the avalanche deposit; fine material is not present in the Parinacota collapse deposit, an unusual feature among debris avalanches. The avalanche deposit displays a noticeable split into two units, the upper one is andesitic and originated from the <b>actual</b> <b>cone,</b> the lower one is derived from the lava domes beneath the present-day edifice.This collapse gave birth to Lake Chungará when the avalanche flowed across a westbound drainage between Choquelimpie and Parinacota, forming a 40 m high volcanic dam that retained about [...] of water. The formation of lakes during sector collapses has been observed at other volcanoes, including the 1988 Mount St. Helens collapse. Prior to the collapse, alluvial and riverine deposits occupied the area. In 2015 it was proposed that a much smaller lake occupied part of the Lake Chungará basin before the collapse.Within the hummock-like topography of the deposit, a number of other lakes and peat filled basins are found, formed by water percolating through the avalanche deposit. These lakes are known as the Lagunas Cotacotani lakes, they are an important bird refuge. At least some of these lakes may be kettle holes, formed when blocks of ice transported within the avalanche melted. With increasing distance from the main cone the size of the lakes decreases. Some of these lakes are connected with each other and others are isolated, and during periods of low lake stands some of the lakes can become disconnected from each other. Springs at the foot of Parinacota form the Rio Benedicto Morales which flows through some of the lakes and ends in the main Lake Cotacotani. Otherwise, these lakes receive water from Lake Chungará through seepage. The lakes ultimately form the headwaters of the Rio Lauca, whose course previously extended across the area covered by the avalanche. The river has not carved an outlet all the way to Lake Chungará, probably because the relatively coarse avalanche deposit allows large amounts of water to seep through without carving a new river channel. The rate at which waters seep through the avalanche deposit has been estimated at it has progressively decreased over time, probably as a consequence of increased siltation within the avalanche deposit. Thus the depth and surface area of Lake Chungará have increased since the formation of the lake and so did evaporation, which currently removes almost 5/6 of the total inflow.|$|E
40|$|Visual {{information}} in natural scenes is distributed over {{a broad range}} of intensities and contrasts. This distribution has to be compressed in the retina to match the dynamic range of retinal neurons. In this study we examined how cones perform this compression and investigated which physiological processes contribute to this operation. M- and L-cones of the goldfish were stimulated with a natural time series of intensities (NTSI) and their responses were recorded. The NTSI displays an intensity distribution which is skewed towards the lower intensities and has a long tail into the high intensity region. Cones transform this skewed distribution into a more symmetrical one. The voltage responses of the goldfish cones were compared to those of a linear filter and a non-linear biophysical model of the photoreceptor. The results show that the linear filter under-represents contrasts at low intensities compared to the <b>actual</b> <b>cone</b> whereas the non-linear biophysical model performs well over the whole intensity range used. Quantitative analysis of the two approaches indicates that the non-linear biophysical model can capture 91 +/- 5 % of the coherence rate (a biased measure of information rate) of the <b>actual</b> <b>cone,</b> where the linear filter only reaches 48 +/- 8 %. These results demonstrate that cone photoreceptors transform an NTSI in a non-linear fashion. The comparison between current clamp and voltage clamp recordings and analysis of the behaviour of the biophysical model indicates that both the calcium feedback loop in the outer segment and the hydrolysis of cGMP are the major components that introduce the specific non-linear response properties found in the goldfish cone...|$|E
40|$|Determining the {{liquefaction}} {{potential of}} soil {{is important in}} earthquake engineering. This study proposes {{the use of the}} Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) to determine the liquefaction potential of soil by using <b>actual</b> <b>cone</b> penetration test (CPT) data. RVM is based on a Bayesian formulation of a linear model with an appropriate prior that results in a sparse representation. The results are compared with a widely used artificial neural network (ANN) model. Overall, the RVM shows good performance and is proven to be more accurate than the ANN model. It also provides probabilistic output. The model provides a viable tool for earthquake engineers to assess seismic conditions for sites that are susceptible to liquefaction...|$|E

The actions of the disseisor must change the state of the land (in the case of non-residential property, taking such actions as clearing, mowing, planting, harvesting fruit of the land, logging or cutting timber, mining, fencing, pulling tree stumps, running livestock and constructing buildings or other improvements) or, if the property is residential, maintaining the property for its intended use (taking such actions as mowing the yard, trimming trees and hedges, changing locks, repairing or replacing fixtures such as a swimming pool, sprinkler system, or appliances), all to the exclusion of its true owner.|$|R

40|$|The tip {{singularity}} of {{the electromagnetic}} field {{at the apex of}} a cone (conical sheet) is investigated in its most general framework. To this end one considers, without loss of generality, a circularly symmetric cone which separates two simple media having different constitutive parameters, and tries to reveal the asymptotic behaviour {{of the electromagnetic}} field created near the apex of the cone by any rotationally symmetric source distribution. To cover various boundary conditions which are extensively used in <b>actual</b> investigations, the <b>cone</b> is supposed to be formed by an infinitely thin material sheet having its own constitutive parameters. The results show that the type and order of the singularity depend, in general, on various parameters such as (i) the apex angle of the cone, (ii) the constitutive parameters of the mediums separated by the cone, (iii) the constitutive parameters of the material cone itself and (iv) the topology of the conical surface. The problem of determining the order in question gives rise to a transcendental algebraic equation involving the Legendre functions of the first kind with complex orders. If the order is a simple root of this equation, then the singularity is always of the algebraic typed whereas a multiple root gives rise also to logarithmic singularities. A numerical method suitable to find a good approximate solution to this equation is also established. Since the general expressions of the boundary conditions on the material cone, which, are compatible with both the Maxwell equations and the topology of the cone, are not known, an attempt has also been made to derive these expressions. Some examples concerning the boundary conditions which are extensively considered in actual investigations are given. Publisher's Versio...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to fabricate and demonstrate an internal reflection sensor (IRS) prototype for the cone penetrometer. The IRS is a sensor that responds in real-time to almost any subsurface liquid contaminants. The IRS utilizes the variations of refractive index of different liquid contaminants as a sensing scheme. All the project objectives have been successfully met {{during the period of}} the program. A prototype IRS that can be easily integrated into a cone penetrometer was designed and fabricated in {{the first phase of the}} program. A controlled field evaluation of the IRS was also conducted during the first phase and results showed that the IRS was capable of locating NAPLs in soil. In the second phase of the program, the IRS was evaluated in the field and pushed into the ground using an <b>actual</b> <b>cone</b> penetrometer system. The IRS was evaluated at known contamination sites at the Savannah River Site and a commercial site in Jacksonville, Florida. Results of the field deployment of the IRS indicated that the sensor was able to sense the location of contaminants such as tetrachloroethylene in the subsurface...|$|E
40|$|Human colour {{perception}} is mediated by multiple factors. These include: the external environment, physiological structures within the eye, and the neuronal pathways that {{originate in the}} eye. The aim of this thesis was to further investigate the impact of three main factors on both the perception and cortical representation of colour. These factors were: the external, changing seasonal environment, genetically determined differences {{in the number of}} photoreceptor types, and spatial filters inherent to cortical and pre-cortical luminance and chromatic pathways. Novel findings and methods were demonstrated in this thesis: 1) 	For the first time, it was found that natural seasonal changes in the chromatic environment (in York, UK) affect the perception of unique yellow; this finding supports the existence of a slow normalisation mechanism, which is governed by changes in the average chromatic environment. 2) 	Genetically atypical individuals, who have fewer photoreceptor types (dichromats), demonstrated no differences in achromatic contrast discrimination thresholds compared to colour-normal trichromats. Therefore, for this particular measure, dichromats do not appear to benefit from increased neuronal resources from ‘unused’ chromatic pathway populations. A multi-channel LED system was developed to allow the isolation of photoreceptor responses in individuals with an additional photoreceptor type (tetrachromats). Modelling of this system indicated that precision in the cone spectra used to generate the stimulus, relative to the observer’s <b>actual</b> <b>cone</b> sensitivities (i. e. peak wavelength sensitivities), is crucial for successful isolation of the cones. 3) 	fMRI-based population receptive field (pRF) mapping was used to measure pRF sizes in the pre-cortical channels. Between the pathways, no differences in pRF sizes were found, however, differences in fMRI measures of spatial frequency sensitivity were observed. These data indicate that spatial frequency tuning in early visual cortex may be decoupled from population receptive field sizes...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, {{significant}} {{efforts have been}} invested {{in the development of}} push-in technology for site characterization and monitoring for geotechnical and environmental purposes and have especially been undertaken in the Netherlands and Germany. These technologies provide the opportunity for faster, cheaper, and collection of more reliable subsurface data. However, to maximize the technology both from a development and implementation point of view, it is necessary to have an overview of the areas suitable for the application of this type of technology. Such an overview is missing and cannot simply be read from existing maps and material. This paper describes the development of a map showing the feasibility or applicability of Direct Push/Cone Penetrometer Technology (DPT/CPT) in Europe which depends on the subsurface and its extremely varying properties throughout Europe. Subsurface penetrability is dependent on a range of factors that have not been mapped directly or can easily be inferred from existing databases, especially the maximum depth reachable would be of interest. Among others, it mainly depends on the geology, the soil mechanical properties, the type of equipment used as well as soil-forming processes. This study starts by looking at different geological databases available at the European scale. Next, a scheme has been developed linking geological properties mapped to geotechnical properties to determine basic penetrability categories. From this, a map of soil penetrability is developed and presented. Validating the output by performing field tests was {{beyond the scope of this}} study, but for the country of the Netherlands, this map has been compared against a database containing <b>actual</b> <b>cone</b> penetrometer depth data to look for possible contradictory results that would negate the approach. The map for the largest part of Europe clearly shows that there is a much wider potential for the application of Direct Push Technology than is currently seen. The study also shows that there is a lack of large-scale databases that contain depth-resolved data as well as soil mechanical and physical properties that can be used for engineering purposes in relation to the subsurface. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundIndoor {{residual}} spraying {{is one of}} the key {{vector control}} interventions for malaria control in Ethiopia. As malaria transmission is seasonal in most parts of Ethiopia, a single round of spraying can usually provide effective protection against malaria, provided the insecticide remains effective over the entire malaria transmission season. This experiment was designed to evaluate the residual efficacy of bendiocarb, pirimiphos-methyl, and two doses of propoxur on four different wall surfaces (rough mud, smooth mud, dung, and paint). Filter papers affixed to wall surfaces prior to spraying were analyzed to determine the <b>actual</b> concentration applied. <b>Cone</b> bioassays using a susceptible Anopheles arabiensis strain were done monthly to determine the time for which insecticides were effective in killing mosquitoes. ResultsThe mean insecticide dosage of bendiocarb applied to walls was 4860 mg/m 2 (target 400 /mg). This treatment lasted 10 month or less on rough mud, smooth mud, and dung, but 40 months on painted surfaces. Pirimiphos-methyl was applied at 18540 mg/m 2 (target 10000 mg/m 2), and lasted between 4 and 60 months on all wall surfaces. Propoxur with a target dose of 10000 mg/m 2 was applied at 3200 mg/m 2, and lasted 20 months or less on all surfaces, except painted surfaces (40 months). Propoxur with a target dose of 20000 mg/m 2, was applied at 6380 mg/m 2, and lasted 30 months on rough mud, but considerably longer (52 ̆ 01370 months) on the other substrates. ConclusionsIt would appear that the higher dose of propoxur and pirimiphos-methyl correspond best to the Ethiopian transmission season, although interactions between insecticide and the substrate should be taken into account as well. However, the insecticide quantification revealed that the dosages actually applied differed considerably from the target dosages, even though care was taken in the mixing of insecticide formulations and spraying of the walls. It is unclear whether this variability is due to initial concentrations of insecticides, poor application, or other factors. Further work is needed to ensure that target doses are correctly applied, both operationally and in insecticide evaluations.
