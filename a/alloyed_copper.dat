5000|$|The {{possible}} {{presence of}} speakers of Indo-European languages in the Tarim Basin by about 2000 BCE could, if confirmed, {{be interpreted as}} evidence that cultural exchanges occurred among Indo-European and Chinese populations {{at a very early}} date. It has been suggested that such activities as chariot warfare and bronze-making may have been transmitted to the east by these Indo-European nomads. Mallory and Mair also note that: [...] "Prior to c. 2000 BC, finds of metal artifacts in China are exceedingly few, simple and, puzzlingly, already made of <b>alloyed</b> <b>copper</b> (and hence questionable)." [...] While stressing that the argument as to whether bronze technology travelled from China to the West or that [...] "the earliest bronze technology in China was stimulated by contacts with western steppe cultures", is far from settled in scholarly circles, they do suggest that the evidence to date favours the latter scenario. However the culture and technology in the northwest region of Tarim basin was less advanced than that in the East China of Yellow River-Erlitou (2070 BCE ~ 1600 BCE) or Majiayao culture (3100 BCE ~ 2600 BCE), which are earliest bronze-using cultures in China, implies that the northwest region did not use copper or any metal until bronze technology was introduced to this region by the Shang Dynasty about 1600 BC. The earliest bronze artifacts in China are found at the Majiayao culture site (dating from between 3100 and 2700 BC), and it is from this location and time period that Chinese Bronze Age spread. Bronze metallurgy in China originated in what {{is referred to as the}} Erlitou (...) period, which some historians argue places it within the range of dates controlled by the Shang dynasty. [...] Others believe the Erlitou sites belong to the preceding Xia (...) dynasty. [...] The U.S. National Gallery of Art defines the Chinese Bronze Age as the [...] "period between about 2000 BC and 771 BC," [...] a period that begins with Erlitou culture and ends abruptly with the disintegration of Western Zhou rule. Though this provides a concise frame of reference, it overlooks the continued importance of bronze in Chinese metallurgy and culture. Since this was significantly later than the discovery of bronze in Mesopotamia, bronze technology could have been imported rather than discovered independently in China. However, there is reason to believe that bronzework did develop inside China separately from outside influence.|$|E

In order to determine the relationship it has been necessary to work out a suitable calculation model.

The attempt to use the artificial neural networks for predicting the effect of the chemical composition and parameters of heat treatment and cold working deformation degree on the hardness succeeded, as the level of the obtained results was acceptable.

Design/methodology/approach: CuTi 4 alloy of supersaturation temperature of 900 Â°C after heating for 1 hour. After solutioning alloy was processed in two ways: first aged in the temperature range 450 - 600 Â°C and the second stage rolling reduction with Z= 50 %, and then aged in the temperature range 450 - 600 Â°C. Findings: The results confirmed that the temperature within the range 500 - 600 ÂºC, the hardness increases with increasing aging time until reaching the maximum, but then with increasing aging time the hardness decreases. By using methods of electron microscopy (SEM, EDS, EBSD, TEM) after aging at 550 Â°C after 1 minute of modulated microstructure was observed - characteristic for the spinodal transformation and lamellar, formed by nucleation and growth.

40|$|The {{hydrogen}} embrittlement controlled stage II {{crack growth rate}} of AA 7050 (6. 09 wt. % Zn, 2. 14 wt% Mg, 2. 19 wt. % Cu) was investigated {{as a function of}} temper and <b>alloyed</b> <b>copper</b> level in a humid air environment at various temperatures. Three tempers representing the underaged, peak aged, and overaged conditions were tested in 90 % relative humidity (RH) air at temperatures between 25 and 90 C. At all test temperatures, an increased degree of aging (from underaged to overaged) produced slower stage II crack growth rates. The stage II crack growth rate of each alloy and temper displayed Arrhenius-type temperature dependence with activation energies between 58 and 99 kJ/mol. For both the normal copper and low copper alloys, the fracture path was predominantly intergranular at all test temperatures (25 - 90 C) in each temper investigated. Comparison of the stage II crack growth rates for normal (2. 19 wt. %) and low (0. 06 wt. %) copper alloys in the peak aged and overaged tempers showed the beneficial effect of copper additions on stage II crack growth rate in humid air. In the 2. 19 wt. % copper alloy, the significant decrease ({approx} 10 times at 25 C) in stage II crack growth rate upon overaging is attributed to an increase in the apparent activation energy for crack growth. IN the 0. 06 wt. % copper alloy, overaging did not increase the activation energy for crack growth but did lower the pre-exponential factor, {nu}{sub 0 }, resulting in a modest ({approx} 2. 5 times at 25 C) decrease in crack growth rate. These results indicate that <b>alloyed</b> <b>copper</b> and thermal aging affect the kinetic factors that govern stage II crack growth rate. Overaged, copper bearing alloys are not intrinsically immune to hydrogen environment assisted cracking but are more resistant due to an increased apparent activation energy for stage II crack growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of dissimilar materials like brass {{and stainless steel}} is often needed in watch movements due to tribologic aspects. For mass production in automotive applications, a joining technique for <b>alloyed</b> <b>copper</b> with alloyed steel is needed. Laser beam micro welding offers an alternative to conventional joining techniques like press fit or soldering. Depending on the joining geometry, two different welding techniques are investigated: seam and spot welding. High strength and reproducibility are the main objective of joining dissimilar metals.

The length of the continuous welding seams are up to 15. 7 mm at a feed rate of up to 60 m/min with a pulsed laser source. The weld width attained ranges from 50 to 250 Âµm and a weld depth from 20 to 150 Âµm. This low energy joining process with minimized heat input results in low distortion of the parts joined.

Stripped deposit foils are inspected by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (TEM-EDX).

EDX analysis of the crystallites shows diverse copper contents of about 34 - 64 at. %, without any phosphorus. Electron diffraction analysis indicates a lattice structure very close to that of Cu. The presence of a phase without phosphorus and enriched in copper at the interface with the Al substrate is also confirmed by Auger electron spectroscopy. This initially arising crystalline phase might exert a limited effect on the main properties of bulk Ni-Cu-P deposits: the composition uniformity through the thickness, amorphous structure and paramagnetic behavior.
