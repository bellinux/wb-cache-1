5|$|A {{survey of}} citizens' attitudes {{conducted}} in May 2006 included two {{questions on the}} issue of the Parliament's seat. On average, 32% people from all member states supported the two-location policy while 68 were against. Support for one location was higher among men than women, and among people over 35 than under. Support for both locations was one percentage point lower in the 10 countries which joined in 2004 than in the 15 earlier members; No group have more than 40 percent support to two locations. Of those against two seats, 76% supported Brussels and 24% supported Strasbourg. In this case support for Brussels was 6 percentage points higher in the 10 new members with women and the under 35 year-olds. The group with the highest support for Strasbourg was the over 35-year-olds with 28 percent support. The citizens of Strasbourg <b>are</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> strong supporter's of the Parliament being based in Strasbourg with each session being worth four million euro to the city's economy. In September 2008, Strasbourg's government passed a motion demanding all of Parliament's activities be relocated to the city.|$|E

25|$|After a 27% loss {{of funding}} from the Department of Transport, Chief Executives of Wiltshire and Swindon Camera Safety Partnership decided to switch off all fixed speed cameras, causing the loss of 40 jobs.

25|$|There <b>are,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> {{differences}} in the resonator, circuits, or calibration required for different categories of parts, but within these categories the frequency translation parameters can often be programmed into the MEMS oscillators late in the production process. Because the components are not differentiated {{until late in the}} process the lead times can be short, typically a few weeks. Technologically, quartz oscillators can be made with circuit-centric programmable architectures like those used in MEMS, but historically only a minority have been built this way.|$|E

25|$|They {{have a large}} {{sagittal}} crest, a bone {{running along}} {{the middle of the}} skull that is necessary for muscle attachment. They also have unusually positioned orbits, an unusually shaped cranium with the frontal bones elevated, and a retracted nasal incision. All of these modifications to the normal mammal skull <b>are,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> {{to make room for the}} proboscis. This proboscis caused a retraction of bones and cartilage in the face during the evolution of the tapir, and even caused the loss of some cartilages, facial muscles, and the bony wall of the nasal chamber.|$|E
25|$|However, if the {{thyrotoxicosis}} {{is treated}} early, bone loss can be minimized. The level of calcium {{in the blood}} can be determined by a simple blood test, and a bone density scan can document the amount of bone loss. There are many medications that can help to rebuild bone mass and to prevent further bone loss. Risedronate treatment has been demonstrated to help restore bone mass in osteopenia/osteoporosis associated with Graves' disease. Nevertheless, weight-bearing exercises, a balanced diet, calcium intake of about 1500mg a day and enough vitamin D, <b>are</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> elementary foundations.|$|E
25|$|Expressive aphasia: Patients {{who suffer}} from this {{condition}} typically have lesions on their left inferior frontal cortex.

Expressive aphasic patients suffer from more regular rule governed principles in forming sentences, which is closely related to Alzheimer patients. For instance instead of saying the red ball bounced, both of these patients would say bounced ball the red. This is just one example of what a person might say; there <b>are</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> many possibilities.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} of literary theory became a profession in the 20th century, {{but it has}} historical roots that run {{as far back as}} ancient Greece (Aristotle's Poetics is an often cited early example), ancient India (Bharata Muni's Natya Shastra), ancient Rome (Longinus's On the Sublime) and medieval Iraq (Al-Jahiz's al-Bayan wa-'l-tabyin and al-Hayawan, and ibn al-Mu'tazz's Kitab al-Badi), and the aesthetic theories of philosophers from ancient philosophy through the 18th and 19th centuries are important influences on current literary study.

25|$|Special costume: traditionally, {{the costumes}} of acolytes, footmen, {{ceremonial}} guards, or slaves help {{show off the}} wealth of the person staging a procession. An ornate example was the embroidered train of George IV of the United Kingdom, carried at his coronation by nine lords in waiting with their own matching silken clothes, capes, ruffs, and plumed hats. Other examples include the Swiss Guard and high vestments of the Pope. The formal, matching clothes of bridesmaids and groomsmen are in the same tradition, although sometimes purchased at the attendant's expense rather than by the people honored in the ceremony. In egalitarian times and places, whoever has taken the time and money to put together something impressive may appear in a parade; such costumes <b>are</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> the focal point of Halloween parades such as that staged in Greenwich Village, New York. Finally, processions may be staged simply to show off the costumes as one part of a larger event, such as at fashion pageants, military reenactments, pop concerts, or Renaissance Festivals.|$|E
25|$|Journalist and {{historian}} Peter Hennessy {{has made an}} assertion, {{in one of his}} books, that a test that the commander of a British nuclear-missile submarine must use to determine whether the UK has been the target of a nuclear attack (in which case he has sealed orders which may authorise him to fire his nuclear missiles in retaliation), is to listen for the presence of Today on Radio 4's frequencies. If a certain number of days (said to be three) pass without the programme being broadcast, that is to be taken as evidence that the orders must be executed. The true conditions <b>are</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> secret, and Hennessy has never revealed his sources for this story, leading Paul Donovan, author of a book about Today, to express some scepticism about it. However, the longwave signal of Radio 4 is capable of penetrating to surface depths where submarines can rise, although it does not have the range required to be heard at this depth far from the UK's coastal waters.|$|E
