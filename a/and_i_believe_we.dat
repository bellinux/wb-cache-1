500|$|As Voorhis {{served his}} fifth {{term in the}} House, local Republicans searched for a {{candidate}} capable of defeating him. Richard Nixon answered the call. Nixon, who {{was still in the}} Navy when approached, wrote of Voorhis, [...] "His 'conservative' reputation must be blasted. But my main efforts are being directed toward building up a positive, progressive group of speeches that tell what we want to do, not what the Democrats have failed to do...

I'm really hopped up over this deal, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> can win." [...] However, [...] "" [...] Republicans deemed Nixon's campaign hopeless. [...] Nixon was a virtual unknown outside of his hometown of Whittier and was facing a popular and respected incumbent. [...] Charles Voorhis wrote his son that the Republicans had endorsed a Quaker named Richard Nixon, but hoped that his son would retain {{a large part of the}} Quaker vote. The elder Voorhis was confident that his son would triumph again, writing, [...] "It is just another campaign that we have to go through... In any event, we have nothing to worry about now." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{are really}} asking the Court two things," [...] he continued. The first {{was to take}} the {{presumption}} that illegal use was intended in that kind of marketing, or at least take judicial notice. The second was in regard to the appeals court's concern about targeting certain lifestyles. [...] "I can't make the argument strong enough that I think under the rational interest of the community and the state {{we have a right to}} legislate against lifestyles, such as homicidal maniacs, burglars, and drug abusers ... We don't like his lifestyle in Hoffman Estates, and I don't think anywhere else in the country do they care for that lifestyle, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> have a right to legislate." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 10 July 1972, while moored at Pier 12, Norfolk, Forrestal {{was once}} again {{the scene of a}} catastrophic fire. This fire, which was set by a crewmember, was in an O-3 level {{computer}} room (just under the flight deck). A hole was cut in the flight deck to reach the fire from above and hundreds of gallons of water were pumped into the space. This ruined all of the computer equipment and the ship took on an exaggerated list, prompting concern that she might capsize. The ship returned to the yards at Portsmouth and three months later was at last able to relieve , which had to serve an extended Mediterranean deployment while the Forrestal was being repaired. Electrician's Mate Robert Horan, who was aboard at the time, recalls in a memoir [...] " [...] over seven million dollars in damage. The news videos...show the flight deck glowing red. We went back to Portsmouth for repairs <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> got most of the CIC and electronics equipment that was supposed to go on board the , then under construction." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} made a shock unannounced return {{during a}} live segment which aired on 19 February 2015 during EastEnders Live Week commemorating the 30th anniversary. Speaking of her return, Gillian Taylforth said: [...] "When Dominic [...] approached {{me with his}} plan, I was so shocked I got into my car and burst into tears! 'Kathy' has always been so close to my heart and it's absolutely wonderful returning to the show and reprising the role." [...] It was then confirmed that Taylforth would reprise her role indefinitely. While Taylforth was initially only contracted to the series for six months, she said that she'd love {{to stay on the}} series for good. Of the return, Treadwell-Collins said [...] "Six months ago, we set ourselves that challenge of bringing Kathy back to the Square in a credible way. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> have succeeded." [...] Taylforth revealed that she was initially hesitant about the storyline. [...] "I couldn't understand how they could work around the fact that she could do that to her children" [...] the actress explained. Taylforth said [...] "it had to be right." [...] In September 2015, Treadwell-Collins revealed to the Daily Mirror that the story was inspired by the real life John Darwin disappearance where John—also known as the Canoe man—with the help of his wife Anne faked his death in a canoe accident in March 2002 in order to claim the insurance. Kathy's husband Gavin Sullivan (Paul Nicholas) had convinced her to fake her death to keep her children safe.|$|E
