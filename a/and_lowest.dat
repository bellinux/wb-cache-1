Carolina First T 2 DM patients were in the observation group, the other subjects admitted to the control group. Prevalence and etiology of blind <b>and</b> <b>low</b> vision were compared.

A perfect jump on a K200 hill would {{therefore}} garner a minimum of 180 points (120 distance points + 60 style points) or more, depending on bonus points. However, such a scenario is only an example and not representative of the highly variable nature of the sport. Gaining one or more scores of 20 is very rare, and five is extremely rare. Generally, a good to excellent jump {{can be expected to}} receive judges' scores of 18 to 19.5.

With all these variables, the augmented VECM models explain 40 – 50 % of variations in daily highs <b>and</b> <b>lows.</b> The generalized impulse response analysis shows that the responses of daily highs <b>and</b> daily <b>lows</b> to the shocks depend on whether data on openings, closings, and trading volume {{are included in the}} analysis.
