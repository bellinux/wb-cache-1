This relationship was the basis of a model to predict the number of <b>advancements</b> by LOS in future years. The present study used that (regression) model as a starting point to accomplish the same goal with a gamma distribution model appropriately parametrized to make it dependent on volume of <b>advancements.</b> The latter model appears nearly as accurate in its predictions as the regression model, while reducing the number of parameters from ninety-three to fifteen for each pay grade of each rating. The relationship between mean LOS and volume of <b>advancements</b> remains approximately the same {{as in the case of}} the regression model.
