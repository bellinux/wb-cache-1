The author opined that basic principle pf Archipelagic State is the unity of land, water, and people. This article explains the <b>archipelagic</b> <b>sea</b> lane passage based on the UNCLOS 1982.

40|$|The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) {{contained}} a specific section for “Archipelagic States” (Part IV) which are given many {{rights under the}} archipelagic regime including, if desired, to designate <b>archipelagic</b> <b>sea</b> lanes (ASLs) through their archipelagic waters. While designation of ASLs is optional, regardless of ASL status, the right of <b>archipelagic</b> <b>sea</b> lane passage (ASLP) for all maritime users is guaranteed. This thesis examines {{the case of the}} Republic of the Philippines in designating ASLs and the influences impacting this process at the state and international levels. This thesis argues that the process of adoption of <b>archipelagic</b> <b>sea</b> lanes by mid-ocean archipelagic states is one which favours the maritime powers over the archipelagic states. Further, in relation to the Philippine case, the efforts of the Republic of the Philippines in repeating some actions undertaken by Indonesia during its case, will strengthen the international system bias and end in a result which will be the by-product of interests other than that of the Philippine state...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the question of}} classifying the <b>sea</b> <b>areas</b> as <b>sea</b> <b>areas</b> difficult for navi-gation, unrestricted <b>sea</b> <b>areas</b> and <b>sea</b> <b>areas</b> restricted by land (bottom or shore).

In this paper author also presents methods {{that can be used for}} estimating safety of navigation (navigational risk) in the restricted <b>sea</b> <b>areas</b> by means of the model of the ship’s domain.

The decline of floristic diversty in the inner <b>sea</b> <b>area</b> of Haidaura was probably related to self-pollution by fish culture. 1999 年 5 月に尾鷲市早田浦の 10 地点において海藻植生，海岸線の状況について調査を行った。採集された海 藻は緑藻綱 8 種，褐藻綱 14 種，紅藻綱 49 種の計 71 種であった。海藻植生から考察した結果，早田浦は内海域， 外海域の 2 つに区分された。海藻相は内海域，特に湾奥部で貧弱で磯焼けも見られた。外海域では海藻相は豊富 でトゲモクが優占するガラモ場が湾口部で広がっていた。湾奥部における海藻植生衰退の原因の 1 つとして魚類養 殖の影響が考えられた...|$|R

40|$|Maritime States {{maintain}} that archipelagic State will {{interfere with the}} fluency of international navigation, since the waters, which were formerly territorial seas and high seas, have been redefined as being archipelagic waters. However, Profesor Hasjim Djalal opines that holding sovereignty over waters between islands is critical to attaining national unity for large archipelagic States. 1 An extension of the jurisdiction by a State may be regarded as undermining {{the freedom of the}} seas. In the course of the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the group of archipelagic States proposed that the regime of innocent passage right should prevail over foreign ships in archipelagic waters. The proposal provided that the right of innocent passage should be guaranteed on sea lanes prescribed by the coastal State. It was, however, rejected by maritime States. Just as the right of innocent passage is applied to the straits for international navigation, it is guaranteed in archipelagic waters. But the right of <b>archipelagic</b> <b>sea</b> lanes passage applies to only certain sea lanes. The maritime States persistently endeavor to maintain right of free passage for their ships.

40|$|Freedoms of {{navigation}} and overflight (FON) are {{extremely important to}} Australia both economically and strategically. This is mainly because of Australia’s dependence on seaborne trade most of which passes through the archipelagos to our north and north-east. The archipelagic arc stretching from Indonesia, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea (PNG) in the north, to the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Fiji in the north-east has great strategic importance to Australia. This is the region from or through which a threat to Australia could most easily be posed. It is also the area that provides opportunities for Australia to work on common interests with the ultimate objective of a more secure and stable region. The countries in the archipelagic arc, {{with the exception of}} Timor-Leste and New Caledonia, are all archipelagic States under the regime of the archipelagic State established under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). In a careful balancing of the interests of archipelagic States and the major maritime user States, rights {{of navigation}} and overflight through the waters of these countries are preserved through the regimes of innocent and <b>archipelagic</b> <b>sea</b> lanes (ASL) passage.  ...|$|R
