In the same way, {{in a few}} traces of glue the presence of proteinaceous substances have been individuated. As for the brush-decorated area, they present a preparation layer rich in feldspars on which a black layer of carbon black particles is applied. On the other hand the purfling areas are colored by an iron-gall dye. In particular the usage of a different ink allowed to identify restored areas.|$|R

From functionalized iridoid and geranyl synthons, 10 -epi-clavudiol A, an epimer of marine dolabellane clavudiol A, has been totally synthesized. Noteworthy steps include a feasible isomerization of the more substituted double bond to the less substituted one via {{the reduction of the}} allylic chloride mediated by Cr(II) Cl_ 2 in the presence of alcoholic proton source and an intramolecular pinacol coupling to form the eleven-membered ring...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Pseudolaric acid <b>A</b> is <b>a</b> <b>diterpenic</b> acid with <b>a</b> hydroazulene skeleton. Work on i t s t o t a l {{synthesis}} {{is nearing}} completion; completed are presented herein. the steps The root bark of Pseudolarix Kaempfer Gorden is a Chinese traditional medicinal herb, called Tu Jin Pi, {{which has been}} used for many years for the treatment of some kinds of fungus disease such as tinea pedis. Three acidic active principles [1, 2, 3] were isolated from it, namely pseudolaric acid A (l), B (2) and C (3). They have not only antifungal activity but also a significant effect on the termination of early pregnancy in rats, rabbits and dogs [4]. The structures of the three pseudolaric acids were elucidated dy spectroscopic analysis and X-ray diffraction, and found to be <b>diterpenic</b> acids with <b>a</b> trans fused hydroazulene skeleton. It is of special interest that the tertiary acetoxy group (or hydroxyl group) was trans to the lactonyl group. No other natural hydroazulene with this type of structure has previously been found...|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} analytical approaches, {{direct exposure}} electron ionisation mass spectrometry (DE-MS) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), were compared {{in a study}} on archaeological resinous materials. DE-MS {{was found to be}} an efficient fingerprinting tool for the fast screening of organic archaeological samples and for providing information on the major components. GC/MS appeared to be more efficient in unravelling the sample composition at a molecular level, despite the length of analysis time and the need for a wet chemical pre-treatment. Both analytical procedures were applied to characterise the organic material present as coatings in Roman and Egyptian amphorae. DE-MS successfully identified abietanic compounds, thus <b>a</b> <b>diterpenic</b> resinous material could be identified and its degree of oxidation assessed. GC/MS enabled us to identify dehydroabietic acid, 7 -oxo-dehydroabietic acid, 15 -hydroxy- 7 -oxo-dehydroabietic acid, 15 -hydroxy-dehydroabietic acid, retene, tetrahydroretene, norabietatriene, norabietatetraene, and methyl-dehydroabietate. These oxidised and aromatised abietanes provided evidence that the amphorae examined were waterproofed with a pitch produced from resinous wood of plants from the Pinaceae family. The chemometric evaluation of the GC/MS data highlighted significant chemical differences between the pitches found in the two archaeological sites, basically related to differences in the production techniques of the materials and in their degradation pathways...|$|R
40|$|Suillus bellinii (Inzenga) Watling is a {{mushroom}} {{belonging to the}} Botelaceae family. The fruiting bodies are characterized by an irregular cap, large pores, a short and squat stem and lastly a whitish dampish flesh with a very sweet taste. Right for these features it {{is considered one of}} the most appreciated species of Suillus group. This species, as well as several edible fungi, is often employed as component of low caloric diets. Moreover it’s widely utilized for its high tumor inhibiting and cytotoxic properties. In this work we report the composition of the methanolic fraction obtained from the fruiting bodies of this mushroom. Four major classes of compounds were isolated: fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids and one aromatic ketone. The fatty acids are still under study to determine the specific compounds as well as the isolated terpenoid and the aromatic ketone. On the other hand it was identified suillin which is formed by <b>a</b> <b>diterpenic</b> chain linked to an aromatic ring in the position 3. This compound was found for the first time in this species although not in the genus and, togheter with isosuillin, it’s responsible for the pharmacological activity of this mushroom. For what concerns the amino acidic part, some were identified like tryptophan and threonine while further analysis is necessary to confirm the suspected presence of valine, leucine and phenylalanine. The presence of amino acids add some nutritional value to this edible fungus...|$|R

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{method for}} eradication of browning exudate {{was developed for}} Hypericum canariensis. For this purpose the effect of natural products on browning exudates were investigated in four types of culture media: Murashige and Skoog (MS, 1962); Gamborg's (B 5, 1979); Woody Plant Medium (WPM, Lloyd and McCown 1981) and modified Quoirin and Lepoivre (QL. 4) (Mederos 1991, Mederos et al. 1995) basal macroelements; these basal macroelements were supplemented with the microelement formula described by Murashige and Skoog (MS, 1962). During the establishment of shoots organogenesis potential was achieved in the Murashige and Skoog (MS, 1962) and modified Quoirin and Lepoivre (QL. 4) (Mederos 1991, Mederos et al. 1995) media after browning exudates was eliminated by rosmanol treatments.

40|$|Cerumen, or propolis, is {{a mixture}} of plant resins enriched with bee secretions. In Australia, stingless bees are {{important}} pollinators that use cerumen for nest construction and possibly for colony’s health. While extensive research attests to the therapeutic properties of honeybee (Apis mellifera) propolis, the biological and medicinal properties of Australian stingless bee cerumen are largely unknown. In this study, the chemical and biological properties of polar extracts of cerumen from Tetragonula carbonaria in South East Queensland, Australia were investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses and in vitro 5 -lipoxygenase (5 -LOX) cell-free assays. Extracts were tested against comparative (commercial tincture of A. mellifera propolis) and positive controls (Trolox and gallic acid). Distinct GC-MS fingerprints of <b>a</b> mixed <b>diterpenic</b> profile typical of native bee cerumen were obtained with pimaric acid (6. 31 ± 0. 97 %, w/w), isopimaric acid (12. 23 ± 3. 03 %, w/w), and gallic acid (5. 79 ± 0. 81 %, w/w) tentatively identified as useful chemical markers. Characteristic flavonoids and prenylated phenolics found in honeybee propolis were absent. Cerumen extracts from T. carbonaria inhibited activity of 5 -LOX, an enzyme known to catalyse production of proinflammatory mediators (IC 50 19. 97 ± 2. 67 μg/ml, mean±SEM, n= 4). Extracts had similar potency to Trolox (IC 50 12. 78 ± 1. 82 μg/ml), but were less potent than honeybee propolis (IC 50 5. 90 ± 0. 62 μg/ml) or gallic acid (IC 50 5. 62 ± 0. 35 μg/ml, P < 0. 001). These findings warrant further investigation of the ecological and medicinal properties of this stingless bee cerumen, which may herald a commercial potential for the Australian beekeeping industry...|$|R
