50|$|<b>Alogliptin</b> (Figure 9) {{is a novel}} DPP-4 {{inhibitor}} {{developed by}} the Takeda Pharmaceutical Company. Researchers hypothesized that a quinazolinone based structure (Figure 9) would have the necessary groups {{to interact with the}} active site on the DPP-4 complex. Quinazolinone based compounds interacted effectively with the DPP-4 complex, but suffered from low metabolic half-life. It was found that when replacing the quinazolinone with a pyrimidinedione, the metabolic stability was increased and the result was a potent, selective, bioavailable DPP-4 inhibitor named <b>alogliptin.</b> The quinazoline based compounds showed potent inhibition and excellent selectivity over related protease, DPP-8. However, short metabolic half-life due to oxidation of the A-ring phenyl group was problematic. At first, the researchers tried to make a fluorinated derivative. The derivative showed improved metabolic stability and excellent inhibition of the DPP-4 enzyme. However, it was also found to inhibit CYP 450 3A4 and block the hERG channel. The solution to this problem was to replace the quinazolinone with other heterocycles, but the quinazolinone could be replaced without any loss of DPP-4 inhibition. <b>Alogliptin</b> was discovered when quinazolinone was replaced with a pyrimidinedione. <b>Alogliptin</b> has shown excellent inhibition of DPP-4 and extraordinary selectivity, greater than 10.000 fold over the closely related serine proteases DPP-8 and DPP-9. Also, it does not inhibit the CYP 450 enzymes nor block the hERG channel at concentration up to 30µM. Based on this data, <b>alogliptin</b> was chosen for preclinical evaluation. In January 2007 <b>alogliptin</b> was undergoing the phase III clinical trial and in October 2008 it was being reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.|$|E

Like other medications {{for the treatment of}} Type 2 diabetes, <b>alogliptin</b> does not decrease the risk of heart attack and stroke. Like other members of the gliptin class, it causes little or no weight gain, exhibits relatively little risk of causing hypoglycemia, and exhibits relatively modest glucose-lowering activity. <b>Alogliptin</b> and other gliptins are commonly used in combination with metformin in patients whose diabetes cannot adequately be controlled with metformin alone.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Type 2 {{diabetes}} {{is a complex}} disease with multiple defects, which generally requires a combination of several pharmacological approaches to reach glucose control targets. A unique fixed-dose combination combines a thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone) and a dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 inhibitor (<b>alogliptin).</b> Area covered: An extensive literature search was performed to analyze the pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone and <b>alogliptin</b> when used separately and in combination {{as well as to}} summarize clinical and toxicological considerations about the combined therapy. Expert opinion: Pioglitazone, a potent insulin sensitizer, and <b>alogliptin,</b> an incretin-based agent that potentiates post-meal insulin secretion and reduces glucagon secretion, have complementary mechanisms of action. The clinical efficacy of a combined therapy is superior to any single therapy in patients treated with diet or with metformin (with or without sulphonylurea). These two drugs can be administered once daily, with or without a meal. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions between the two agents have been described and the fixed-dose combination has shown bioequivalence with <b>alogliptin</b> and pioglitazone given separately. Combining <b>alogliptin</b> with pioglitazone does not alter the safety profile of each compound.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>alogliptin,</b> a potent and highly selective dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP- 4) inhibitor, in combination with glyburide in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by sulphonylurea monotherapy. Methods: After a 2 -week screening period, adult patients 18 - 80 years of age entered a 4 -week run-in/stabilization period {{in which they were}} switched from their own sulphonylurea medication to an equivalent dose of glyburide (open label) plus placebo (single blind). After the run-in period, patients were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with <b>alogliptin</b> 12. 5 mg (n = 203), <b>alogliptin</b> 25 mg (n = 198), or placebo (n = 99) for 26 weeks. The primary end-point was change from baseline to week 26 in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c). Secondary end-points included clinical response rates and changes in fasting plasma glucose, β-cell function (fasting proinsulin, insulin, proinsulin/insulin ratio, and C-peptide, and homeostasis model assessment β-cell function), body weight, and safety end-points [adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs and electrocardiographic readings]. Results: The study population had a mean age of 57 years and a mean disease duration of 8 years; it was well balanced for gender (52 % women) and was mainly white (71 %). The mean baseline HbA 1 c was approximately 8. 1 % in each group. Significantly greater least squares (LS) mean reductions in HbA 1 c were seen at week 26 with <b>alogliptin</b> 12. 5 mg (- 0. 38 %) and 25 mg (- 0. 52 %) vs. placebo (+ 0. 01 %; p < 0. 001), and more patients in the <b>alogliptin</b> 25 -mg group had HbA 1 c levels ≤ 7. 0 % at week 26 (34. 8 %, p = 0. 002) vs. placebo (18. 2 %). Proportionately more patients in the <b>alogliptin</b> 12. 5 mg (47. 3 %) and 25 mg (50. 5 %) groups had an HbA 1 c reduction ≥ 0. 5 % from baseline compared with patients in the placebo group (26. 3 %; p < 0. 001). Minor improvements in individual markers of β-cell function were seen with <b>alogliptin,</b> but no significant treatment group differences were noted relative to placebo. Minor LS mean changes in body weight were noted across groups (placebo, - 0. 20 kg; <b>alogliptin</b> 12. 5 mg, + 0. 60 kg; <b>alogliptin</b> 25 mg, + 0. 68 kg). AEs were reported for 63 - 64 % of patients receiving <b>alogliptin</b> and 54 % of patients receiving placebo. Few AEs were treatment limiting (2. 0 - 2. 5 % across groups), and serious AEs (2. 0 - 5. 6 %) were infrequent, similar across groups, and generally considered not related to treatment. The incidences of hypoglycaemia for placebo, <b>alogliptin</b> 12. 5 mg and <b>alogliptin</b> 25 mg groups were 11. 1, 15. 8 and 9. 6 % respectively.

Inhibition of DPP- 4 elevates levels of the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide (GLP- 1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) by preventing their degradation. Objective: To review the evolution of <b>alogliptin</b> and its pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy and adverse effects. In addition, we compared <b>alogliptin</b> to other DPP- 4 inhibitors. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed using the term &lsquo;alogliptin&rsquo;. Original research articles and review articles as well as scientific abstracts were included. Results: <b>Alogliptin</b> raises postprandial levels of GLP- 1. It has excellent bioavailability exhibiting a median Tmax ranging from 1 to 2 hours and a mean half-life of 12. 4 to 21. 4 hours across all doses. When given as monotherapy, mean hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) reductions achieved were 0. 5 % to 0. 6 %. Combination therapy yielded similar reductions (&minus; 0. 5 % with metformin, &minus; 0. 6 % with glyburide, &minus; 0. 8 % with pioglitazone and &ndash; 0. 6 % with insulin). Administration of <b>alogliptin</b> does not promote weight loss but has not resulted in weight gain.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Different dipeptidyl {{peptidase}} (DPP) - 4 inhibitors show significant structural differences. The aim of {{this study}} was to find any differential effects on metabolic parameters between sitagliptin and <b>alogliptin.</b> Methods: Drug naive subjects with type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM) were assigned to either 25 - 100 mg/day sitagliptin (n= 37) or 6. 25 - 25 mg/day <b>alogliptin</b> (n= 35) monotherapy. At 3 months, the levels of glycemic and non-glycemic parameters were compared with those at baseline. Results: At baseline, the levels of these parameters were similar between these two groups. At 3 months, similar glucose lowering efficacies were observed in both groups. However, distinct regulatory patters were observed with lipid profiles. In the sitagliptin group, high triglyceride (TG) and free fatty acid (FFA) levels significantly decreased. However, in the <b>alogliptin</b> group, significant reductions of total cholesterol (T-C), non-high density lipoprotein (non-HDL) -C and low density lipoprotein (LDL) -C levels were observed and changes of (Δ) HbA 1 c levels were weakly correlated with those of ΔT-C, Δnon-HDL-C or ΔLDL-C. Besides these lipid parameters, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) -B increased in both groups (+ 52. 3 % for sitagliptin and + 91. 2 % for <b>alogliptin)</b> with significant inter-group differences (p< 0. 05). Both drugs are well tolerated and no clinically significant adverse events were observed. However, uric acid (UA) levels increased, although still within normal limit, in both groups. Conclusions: This study suggests that: 1) both sitagliptin and <b>alogliptin</b> are effective and safe as an initial therapy for T 2 DM. 2) <b>alogliptin</b> can ameliorate atherogenic lipid profiles and these atherogenic lipids may be associated with the glycemic effect during <b>alogliptin</b> treatment.

Several factors were compared between the two groups of patients: those who could withdraw from insulin therapy and those who could not. The former group showed lower HbA 1 c levels on admission, a lower insulin dose before adding <b>alogliptin,</b> lower injection frequencies, and longer treatment histories prior to admission. Logistic regression analysis showed that lower insulin dose contributed significantly to withdrawal. These results suggest that a lower insulin dose is the best predictor for withdrawal from insulin therapy after adding <b>alogliptin.</b> KEY WORDS: <b>alogliptin,</b> insulin therapy, type 2 diabetes CITATION: Hamamoto et al. analyzing the Factors Contributing to Withdrawal from insulin Therapy Following additional administration of alogliptin: Retrospective study after Removing Glucotoxicity with insulin.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{evaluate}} the dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP- 4) inhibitor <b>alogliptin</b> in drug-naïve patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes. RESEARCHDESIGNANDMETHODS — This double-blind, placebo-controlled, mul-ticenter study included 329 patients with poorly controlled diabetes randomized to once-daily treatment with 12. 5 mg <b>alogliptin</b> (n 133), 25 mg <b>alogliptin</b> (n 131), or placebo (n 65) for 26 weeks. Primary efficacy end point was mean change from baseline in A 1 C {{at the final}} visit. RESULTS — At week 26, mean change in A 1 C was significantly greater (P 0. 001) for 12. 5 mg (0. 56 %) and 25 mg (0. 59 %) <b>alogliptin</b> than placebo (0. 02 %). Reductions in fasting plasma glucose were also greater (P 0. 001) in alogliptin-treated patients than in those receiv-ing placebo. Overall, incidences of adverse events (67. 4 – 70. 3 %) and hypoglycemia (1. 5 – 3. 0 %) were similar across treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS — <b>Alogliptin</b> monotherapy was well tolerated and significantly improved glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, without raising the incidence of hypoglycemia.

40|$|Daniel Q Holland, Joshua J NeumillerDepartment of Pharmacotherapy, College of Pharmacy, Washington State University, Spokane, Washington, USAAbstract: <b>Alogliptin</b> is a {{selective}} dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 inhibitor recently marketed for once-daily {{administration in the}} treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). Fixed-dose combinations of <b>alogliptin</b> with both metformin and pioglitazone are also commercially available, providing a measure of convenience in addition to an effective mode of delivering combination therapy to improve glycemic control. <b>Alogliptin</b> has been studied clinically as initial therapy in treatment-naïve patients with T 2 DM and as initial therapy or add-on in combination with other antidiabetic agents. Clinical trial data with <b>alogliptin</b> demonstrate clinical efficacy in terms of glycosylated hemoglobin A 1 c and fasting plasma glucose reductions when used both as monotherapy and as a component of two- or three-drug combination regimens for the treatment of T 2 DM. Extensive Phase II and Phase III clinical trial data support the use of <b>alogliptin</b> in combination with metformin and pioglitazone. Glycemic reduction with both combinations is similar to the sum of the respective monotherapies, with adverse event rates similar – or more moderate – than those observed with up-titration of monotherapy or the addition of other antihyperglycemic agents.

40|$|Abstract Background Postprandial hyperlipidemia impairs endothelial {{function}} and {{participates in the}} development of atherosclerosis. We investigated the postprandial effects of a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor, <b>alogliptin,</b> on endothelial dys{{function and}} the lipid profile. Methods A randomized cross-over trial design in 10 healthy volunteers (8 males and 2 females, 35 ± 10 years) was performed. The postprandial effects before and after a 1 -week treatment of 25 mg/day <b>alogliptin</b> on endothelial function were assessed with brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and changing levels of lipids, apolipoprotein B 48 (apoB- 48), glucose, glucagon, insulin, and glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) during fasting and at 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after a standard meal loading test. Results <b>Alogliptin</b> treatment significantly suppressed the postprandial elevation in serum triglyceride (incremental area under the curve [AUC]; 279 ± 31 vs. 182 ± 32 mg h/dl, p = 0. 01), apoB- 48 (incremental AUC; 15. 4 ± 1. 7 vs. 11. 7 ± 1. 1 μg h/ml, p = 0. 04), and remnant lipoprotein cholesterol (RLP-C) (incremental AUC: 29. 3 ± 3. 2 vs. 17. 6 ± 3. 3 mg h/dl, p = 0. 01). GLP- 1 secretion was significantly increased after <b>alogliptin</b> treatment. Postprandial endothelial dysfunction (maximum decrease in%FMD, from − 4. 2 ± 0. 5 % to − 2. 6 ± 0. 4 %, p = 0. 03) was significantly associated with the maximum change in apoB- 48 (r = − 0. 46, p = 0. 03) and RLP-C (r = − 0. 45, p = 0. 04). Conclusion <b>Alogliptin</b> significantly improved postprandial endothelial dysfunction and postprandial lipemia, suggesting that <b>alogliptin</b> may be a promising anti-atherogenic agent. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background - To assess {{potentially}} elevated cardiovascular risk {{related to}} new antihyperglycemic drugs {{in patients with}} type 2 diabetes, regulatory agencies require a comprehensive evaluation of the cardiovascular safety profile of new antidiabetic therapies. We assessed cardiovascular outcomes with <b>alogliptin,</b> a new inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP- 4), as compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes who had had a recent acute coronary syndrome. Methods - We randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and either an acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina requiring hospitalization within the previous 15 to 90 days to receive <b>alogliptin</b> or placebo in addition to existing antihyperglycemic and cardiovascular drug therapy. The study design was a double-blind, noninferiority trial with a prespecified noninferiority margin of 1. 3 for the hazard ratio for the primary end point of a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Results - A total of 5380 patients underwent randomization and were followed for up to 40 months (median, 18 months). A primary end-point event occurred in 305 patients assigned to <b>alogliptin</b> (11. 3 %) and in 316 patients assigned to placebo (11. 8 %) (hazard ratio, 0. 96; upper boundary of the one-sided repeated confidence interval, 1. 16; P< 0. 001 for noninferiority). Glycated hemoglobin levels were significantly lower with <b>alogliptin</b> than with placebo (mean difference, - 0. 36 percentage points; P< 0. 001). Incidences of hypoglycemia, cancer, pancreatitis, and initiation of dialysis were similar with <b>alogliptin</b> and placebo. Conclusions - Among patients with type 2 diabetes who had had a recent acute coronary syndrome, the rates of {{major adverse cardiovascular events}} were not increased with the DPP- 4 inhibitor <b>alogliptin</b> as compared with placebo.

40|$|Background: It is {{postulated}} {{that the ability}} of dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 inhibitors (DPP- 4 -i) to increase circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) may be at least partly mediated by active stromal cell–derived factor 1 α (SDF- 1 α) (a pivotal mediator of stem cell mobilization from the bone marrow). As other DPP- 4 -i were demonstrated to increase EPC concentrations, in this study, we sought to investigate {{the ability of the}} DPP- 4 -i <b>alogliptin</b> in modifying EPCs and SDF- 1 α, in patients with good and poor diabetes control. Methods: Two groups of diabetic patients on metformin were divided by hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) : Group A—those with HbA 1 c ≤ 6. 5 % (28 patients) and Group B—those with HbA 1 c 7. 5 % to 8. 5 % (31 patients). Both groups received <b>alogliptin</b> 25 [*]mg/daily for 4 [*]months. At baseline and 4 [*]months later, clinical, laboratory parameters, EPCs, and active SDF- 1 α were determined. Results: After 4 -month treatment with <b>alogliptin,</b> either Group A or Group B showed reduced HbA 1 c levels and concomitant similar increase in EPCs and active SDF- 1 α. Conclusions: <b>Alogliptin</b> showed significant benefits in increasing EPCs and active SDF- 1 α either in good or poor diabetes control. The study demonstrated that similar to other DPP- 4 -i, also <b>alogliptin</b> is able to increase EPC concentrations, suggesting the existence of a class effect mediated by SDF- 1 α. The extent of increase in EPCs is independent from baseline diabetes control...|$|E
