5|$|Early {{aircraft}} {{suffered from}} leaks in wing fuel tanks that required re-sealing after each flight and 85 aircraft {{were found to}} have cracks in outer wing ribs and stringers. There were also problems with <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> cylinders, electrical connectors, and engine compartment fires. Reconnaissance RF-4Cs made their debut in Vietnam on 30 October 1965, flying the hazardous post-strike reconnaissance missions. The USAF Thunderbirds used the F-4E from the 1969 season until 1974.|$|E
25|$|During further testing, the {{prototype}} was destroyed on 23 August 1947 in a fatal crash on {{take off from}} Woodford which killed Roy Chadwick; air accident investigators later discovered that the crash was due to incorrect assembly of the <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> circuit.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} designer Roy Chadwick {{was killed}} on 23 August 1947 during a crash on take-off of the prototype Avro Tudor 2, G-AGSU, from Woodford airfield. The accident was due to an error in an overnight servicing in which the <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> cables were inadvertently crossed.|$|E

25|$|Although <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> was sluggish, both rudder and {{elevator}} control were considered satisfactory and the unconventional {{design of the}} fuselage appeared {{not to have a}} detrimental effect on the aircraft's flying characteristics. The anticipated aerodynamic benefits of the tall fuselage filling the gap between the wings were not found on the full-size aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The SA-160 has an {{aluminum}} wing design, utilizing a NASA GAW-2 Whitcomb airfoil. To simplify construction the wing has no washout and instead has two composite vortex generators {{of a unique}} design, outboard on each wing, {{to ensure that the}} inboard portion of the wing stalls first, thus retaining <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> through the stall.|$|E
25|$|Wind {{gradient}} is also {{a hazard}} for aircraft making steep turns near the ground. It is a particular problem for gliders which have a relatively long wingspan, which exposes them to a greater wind speed difference for a given bank angle. The different airspeed experienced by each wing tip can result in an aerodynamic stall on one wing, causing a loss of control accident. The rolling moment generated by the different airflow over each wing can exceed the <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> authority, causing the glider to continue rolling into a steeper bank angle.|$|E

5000|$|... 1994-10-31 American Eagle Flight 4184 While in {{a holding}} pattern, {{extensive}} ice accumulation produced a sudden reversal of the <b>aileron</b> <b>controls,</b> causing the plane to upset and dive into the ground.|$|R
50|$|On 23 November 1948, F-BATM of Air France crashed at Toulouse, Haute-Garonne whilst {{on a test}} flight, {{killing one}} of the five people on board. The cause of the {{accident}} was that the <b>aileron</b> <b>controls</b> had been assembled incorrectly.|$|R
25|$|While {{owned by}} Jenista the {{aircraft}} {{was destroyed in}} an accident on 11 June 1994 at the Jean Airport in Jean, Nevada. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the pilot did not properly connect the <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> linkage when the aircraft was assembled for flight and then did not detect the fault during the preflight inspection. The pilot {{become aware of the}} problem on take-off on aerotow. The pilot released from the tow plane at about , the right wing collided with the ground and the glider crashed resulting in minor injury to the pilot. The aircraft was not repaired and was removed from the Federal Aviation Administration registry on 29 April 1995.|$|E
500|$|The I-250 was a low-wing, {{all-metal}} aircraft with a monocoque fuselage. Other {{than the}} VRDK the aircraft was largely conventional in layout, although the cockpit was set very {{far back in}} the fuselage, almost {{to the base of}} the vertical tail. The two-spar wings had a thickness of 10% to preserve <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> and avoid tip stall. They were fitted with Frise ailerons and slotted flaps. Fuel was contained in a [...] fuselage tank and a [...] tank in each wing. The conventional landing gear mainwheels had a levered suspension and retracted inwards. The tail wheel retracted aft into the very small ventral fin. The VK-107A engine initially drove a [...] VISh-105SV propeller.|$|E
500|$|Aviation {{historian}} Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith stated {{a number}} of times that the Wrights' legal victory would have been [...] "doubtful" [...] if an 1868 patent of [...] "a prior but lost invention" [...] by Matthew Piers Watt Boulton of the UK had been known in the period 1903–1906. The patent, titled Aërial Locomotion , described several engine improvements and conceptual designs and included a technical description and drawings of an <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> system and an optional feature intended to function as an autopilot. 392. : Aärial Locomotion [...] ", London: Great Seal Patent Office (printed by George E. Eyre and William Spottiswoode), 1868. In fact, this patent was well-known to participants in the Wright-Curtiss lawsuit. A U.S. federal judge who reviewed previous inventions and patents and upheld the Wright patent against the Curtiss company reached the opposite conclusion of Gibbs-Smith, saying the Boulton patent [...] "is not anticipatory".|$|E

25|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that the}} cause of the accident was that the co-pilot's <b>aileron</b> <b>controls</b> had jammed due to a chain slipping off its sprocket. The difficulty of setting and inspecting the chains in the dual control columns was cited as a contributory factor in the accident.|$|R
5000|$|On 3 March 1952, SNCASE Languedoc P/7 F-BCUM of Air France crashed {{shortly after}} {{take-off}} killing all 38 people on board. The {{cause of the}} accident was that the <b>aileron</b> <b>controls</b> had jammed. The aircraft was operating a domestic scheduled passenger flight from Nice to Orly Airport, Paris.|$|R
2500|$|Boulton's {{description}} of his <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> system was both clear and complete. It was [...] "the first record we have of appreciation of the necessity for active lateral control as distinguished from .... With this invention of Boulton's we have {{the birth of the}} present-day three torque method of airborne control" [...] as was praised by Charles Manly. This was also endorsed by C.H. Gibbs-Smith.|$|E
2500|$|Gibbs-Smith {{later wrote}} in his 1960 opus, The Aeroplane: An Historical Survey of its Origins and Development, that [...] "Boulton invented a method of control {{identical}} with the modern <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> system in 1868. Had it not been overlooked, {{the history of the}} practical aeroplane would have been radically different, since it was the problem of achieving lateral stability and control that plagued the Wrights, Langley, Curtiss, and the whole [...] "European School" [...] 30–40 years later".|$|E
2500|$|After its {{repair the}} 81 GR made {{a second and}} final attempt to regain the record. Even during {{take-off}} from Istres on 18 October 1932, Marmoz noticed the aileron controls were slack, the ailerons themselves vibrated and there were large oscillations of the wings, with amplitude as much as 1m. [...] He dumped most of the fuel and returned, landing safely. It {{turned out that the}} wing oscillations were excited by a very stiff undercarriage suspension that transmitted ground forces into the wings, the motion of which damaged the <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> runs.|$|E
25|$|The JN-2 was an equal-span biplane with <b>ailerons</b> <b>controlled</b> by a {{shoulder}} yoke in the aft cockpit. It was deficient in performance, particularly climbing, because of excessive weight. The improved JN-3 incorporated unequal spans with ailerons {{only on the}} upper wings, controlled by a wheel. In addition, a foot bar was added to control the rudder.|$|R
50|$|The White Wing (or Aerodrome #2) was {{an early}} US {{aircraft}} designed by Frederick W. Baldwin and built by the Aerial Experiment Association in 1908. Unusual for aircraft of its day, it featured a wheeled undercarriage. The wings were equipped with <b>ailerons</b> <b>controlled</b> by a harness worn around the pilot's body; leaning in one direction would cause the aircraft to bank to follow.|$|R
50|$|In {{aeronautics}} spoilerons, {{also known}} as spoiler <b>ailerons,</b> are flight <b>control</b> surfaces, specifically spoilers {{that can be used}} asymmetrically to provide adequate roll <b>control</b> if <b>aileron</b> action would produce excessive wing twist on a very flexible wing or if wide-span flaps prevent adequate <b>aileron</b> roll <b>control.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{design was}} noted for light and {{effective}} control surfaces that provided good manoeuvrability but {{required that the}} rudder not be used aggressively at high speeds. Poor <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> at low speeds when landing and taking off was also a problem for inexperienced crews. For flying at low speeds, the flaps had to be set at 15°, speed reduced to [...] and rpm set to 2,650. The speed could be reduced to an acceptable [...] for low speed flying. For cruising the maximum speed for obtaining maximum range was [...] at [...] weight.|$|E
2500|$|The SP-1 {{received}} two nicknames, the first [...] "Old Number 16" [...] as the sixteenth Bowlus glider, and [...] "Paperwing" [...] because its wing rib webs were fabricated from craft paper. The ribs {{of both the}} rudder and the elevator were also made with paper webbing. Otherwise the aircraft was predominantly wood and doped aircraft fabric. The aircraft originally had a [...] span wing with a USA 35-A airfoil with conventional <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> and landing wheels for the rough dirt surface at Lindbergh Field. The wing was later redesigned to include tip-ailerons, extending the wingspan to [...] The aircraft achieved a very low empty weight for its size of [...] and a matching low wing loading as well.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 February, {{official}} trials {{began at}} the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A) [...] based at Boscombe Down, although de Havilland's representative was surprised by a delay in starting the tests. On 24 February, as W4050 taxied across the rough airfield, the tailwheel jammed leading to the fuselage fracturing. Repairs were made by early March, using part of the fuselage of the Photo-Reconnaissance prototype W4051. In spite of this setback, the Initial Handling Report 767 issued by the A stated [...] "The aeroplane is pleasant to fly ... <b>Aileron</b> <b>control</b> light and effective ..." [...] The maximum speed reached was [...] at , with an estimated maximum ceiling of [...] and a maximum rate of climb of [...] at [...]|$|E
50|$|A {{brilliant}} and skilful airman {{who has been}} conspicuous for his success in aerial combats. On 30 October he, single handed, engaged five enemy aeroplanes and drove one down out of control. In the fight his <b>aileron</b> <b>controls</b> were shot away, but by skilful handling and with cool presence of mind he brought his machine back and made a successful landing. In addition to the above Capt. Banks has accounted for nine other enemy machines.|$|R
25|$|The 1952 Air France SNCASE Languedoc crash {{occurred}} on 3 March 1952 when a SNCASE SE.161/P7 Languedoc aircraft of Air France crashed on take-off from Nice Airport for Le Bourget Airport, Paris, killing all 38 people on board. The {{cause of the}} accident was that the <b>aileron</b> <b>controls</b> had jammed, which in itself was contributed to by a design fault. The accident was the third-deadliest in France {{at the time and}} is the deadliest involving the SNCASE Languedoc.|$|R
5000|$|The S-11 was a {{two seat}} mid-wing {{monoplane}} with wire-braced wings {{powered by a}} Gnome Monosoupape air-cooled rotary engine rated at [...] It was smaller and lighter than the S-7 on which it was based, and had a conventional wooden fuselage. The cockpit featured side-by-side seating with controls for the pilot only on the left. Originally built with <b>ailerons</b> <b>controlled</b> by steel tubes inside the wings, it was later redesigned using wing warping for roll control.|$|R
2500|$|The Tandem Twin {{was another}} early {{example of a}} twin engine aircraft. It was built for Francis McClean, using parts of S.27. fitted with a short nacelle {{on top of the}} lower wing with a [...] Gnome Omega at either end, access to the cockpit being via a hole in the nacelle floor. [...] Tail {{surfaces}} were modified by the addition of an extra pair of rectangular rudders above the tailplane. It was first flown by McClean on 29 October 1911. with equal-span wings: extensions were later fitted to the upper wing. The aircraft suffered from stability problems due to insufficient <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> and unpredictable variations caused by the rear propeller working {{in the wake of the}} front one. [...] It was lent to the RNAS for pilot training and was eventually crashed by Samson. [...] The aircraft was given the nicknames the Vacuum Cleaner and [...] the Gnome Sandwich.|$|E
2500|$|In 1868, {{long before}} the advent of powered {{aircraft}} flight — and within a decade of the birth of both Orville and Wilbur Wright — Boulton patented the first aileron. [...] The aileron system he created was to be actuated by either a hand operated control (not illustrated on the patent's drawings) or by an automatic pendulum control device (depicted on the patent's drawing sheet), with the intended function of a single-axis autopilot. Boulton's inspiration for a lateral flight control device has been attributed to French Count Ferdinand Charles Honore Phillipe d'Esterno, whose detailed analysis of flapping and soaring bird flight, Du Vol des Oiseaux (On the flight of birds) was published as a pamphlet in 1864. Although Boulton's prescient <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> system was fully functional, he, as did almost everyone of his era, lacked a detailed understanding of aerodynamics, and an airplane he designed never achieved flight.|$|E
2500|$|After 210 P-38Es were built, {{they were}} followed, {{starting}} in April 1942, by the P-38F, which incorporated racks inboard {{of the engines}} for fuel tanks or a total of [...] of bombs. Early variants did not enjoy a high reputation for maneuverability, though they could be agile at low altitudes if flown by a capable pilot, using the P-38's forgiving stall characteristics to their best advantage. From the P-38F-15 model onwards, a [...] "combat maneuver" [...] setting {{was added to the}} P-38's Fowler flaps. When deployed at the 8° maneuver setting, the flaps allowed the P-38 to out-turn many contemporary single-engined fighters at the cost of some added drag. However, early variants were hampered by high <b>aileron</b> <b>control</b> forces and a low initial rate of roll, and all such features required a pilot to gain experience with the aircraft, which in part was an additional reason Lockheed sent its representative to England, and later to the Pacific Theater.|$|E
50|$|The Fly Baby was {{designed}} to be a very simple aircraft. For example, the fuel gauge is a stiff wire attached to a float poking up through the gas cap (a common application in the 1930s and 1940s, as seen on Piper and Aeronca light aircraft). The structure is of aircraft-grade spruce and plywood (Bowers did not advocate skimping on the quality of structural wood), covered with doped aircraft fabric. <b>Aileron</b> <b>controls</b> are push-tube, elevator controls are a combination of push-tube and cable, the rudder is cable-controlled.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been made at supersonic Mach numbers to determine the feasibility of using a ram-air-spoiler roll control device on a typical canard control missile configuration. As a basis for roll <b>control</b> comparisons, conventional <b>aileron</b> <b>controls</b> on the tail fins were also tested. Results are presented which indicate that the addition of nacelles on the missile tail fins resulted in satisfactory roll control effectiveness and only small changes in basic missile stability. The ram-air-spoiler roll control effectiveness is relatively constant over the range of vehicle attitudes and Mach numbers investigated...|$|R
5000|$|On 11 March 1985, an Antonov An-30 of the Soviet Air Force was on {{an aerial}} {{photography}} flight in the Kabul area south of the Panjshir Valley.
