[...] Wichita State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, School of Social WorkTransportable Physician Orders for Patient Preferences (T-POPP) is a POLST (Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment) {{paradigm}} {{medical order}} form currently being {{developed as a}} bi-state initiative. T-POPP allows patients with serious illnesses to permit, limit, or refuse medical interventions. This thesis describes the documentation surrounding current resuscitation status orders for <b>accessibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>clarity</b> in the medical record prior to the regional implementation of T-POPP, {{in order to better}} understand at baseline how useful the present system is. Three code status designations are currently in use at KU Hospital relative to cardiac arrest: Full Code (which permits any and all resuscitative efforts); LAR, limited attempts at resuscitation (which permits certain medical interventions and limits others); and DNAR, do not attempt resuscitation (which limits all resuscitative interventions). This study methodology consisted of a systematic review of chart abstractions and reviews for patients with LAR and DNAR instructions in March 2011 from the University of Kansas Hospital. This study explores the prevalence of such orders, how decisions regarding these orders are documented in the medical record for clarity and accessibility, and associated patient demographics. <b>Accessibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>clarity</b> of such documentation is paramount. This study found that there is a high prevalence (96. 2 %) of documentation regarding code status orders, though significantly lower prevalence of documentation with clarity and accessibility; the highest level of clarity is found in orders with direct quotes and paraphrases; the highest level of accessibility is found in resuscitation status notes and chart notations in the code status order comments section; and that advance directives are not usually available at bedside to provide guidance for plan of care at point of care...|$|E

40|$|Quality {{has become}} the key concept in {{official}} statistics. There is a general consensus {{that we have to}} consider several components when assessing the quality of statistical information. Relevance, accuracy, timeliness, punctuality, comparability, coherence, <b>accessibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>clarity</b> are the dimensions most frequently mentioned. In this article we use regression analysis to evaluate the contribution of these different dimensions when assessing the overall quality of statistical products. We do this using the information collected in the structured consultation with users and experts from {{both inside and outside the}} Spanish Central Administration carried out by the Working Group of the Spanish High Council on Statistics, responsible for the preliminary draft of the proposals and recommendations of this council for the Spanish Multiannual Statistical Programme 2013 - 2016.

40|$|Many {{statistical}} {{institutions have}} launched systematic quality work, with user needs {{as the point}} of departure for defining quality. One of the main quality dimensions of statistics is <b>accessibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>clarity</b> of statistics. Statistical metadata defined as systematic documentation of statistics are necessary for users to find, understand and use the statistics. In addition metadata linked to production processes are necessary to improve these. Hence, metadata has become an important issue in the work on improving quality and efficiency in statistical institutions. The paper considers the role of metadata within the framework of systematic quality work. Typical challenges a statistical institution faces in this field are how to provide different metadata to different external and internal users on different levels of detail, and how to implement and link various metadata systems to promote efficiency in production processes and dissemination. Statistics Norway has developed many different metadata systems to serve different purposes and different user groups. These systems have often been developed in isolation from each other in a traditional &quot;stovepipe&quot; environment. This has led to the same information being stored several times in several places making the availability of updated and consistent information difficult. In the last two years, there has been a strong focus on the need to link existing systems and a requirement that new metadata systems should not be built in isolation...|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Acceptance of information technology (IT) has remained a topic of interest for a last few decades. Several theories, specifically over the conceptualisation of the technology acceptance model (TAM) have emerged {{and they have been}} applied in different contexts to investigate new insights into the acceptance behaviour at individual and organisational levels. However, despite TAM’s maturity and validity in different contexts, very little published literature strives to extend its capability to predict individuals’ acceptance behaviour about an online banking information system (OBIS). A possible rational for this gap may be conceptualisation of the TAM under which individuals’ acceptance behaviour can only be predicted with two beliefs: perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived usefulness (PU). The evidence in literature shows that PU and PEOU beliefs are not sufficient; hence, they may not explain individuals’ acceptance behaviour in emerging contexts, such as online banking information systems, especially in developing economies such as Pakistan. There is therefore a need for inclusion of any additional factor that can enhance prediction of acceptance of online banking information system by potential users. Extending research on the TAM, this study developed and tested a model of OBIS acceptance. The proposed model integrated key constructs from the information systems acceptance research stream into the theoretical frame of the TAM and other theories from social psychology, such as the theory of reasoned action (TRA), theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and the TAM 2. According to the proposed conceptual model, OBIS acceptance was determined by eight main factors, which included perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, trust, technological self-efficacy, response time, output quality, <b>accessibility,</b> <b>and</b> terminology <b>clarity.</b> In this model, PU was hypothesised to be affected by PEOU, trust, technological self-efficacy (TSE), output quality (OQ) and response time (RT). In addition, PEOU was hypothesised to be determined by three external factors: TSE, <b>accessibility</b> <b>and</b> terminology <b>clarity</b> (TC). The model was tested on a sample of 353 Internet banking users in Pakistan. Using structural equation modelling with Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) software, data analysis showed considerable support for the extended hypothesised model. The result indicated that, in order of importance, PU, PEOU and trust explained 45. 7...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recent British National Health Service (NHS) reforms, in {{response}} to austerity and alleged ‘health tourism,’ could impose additional barriers to healthcare access for non-European Economic Area (EEA) migrants. This study explores policy reform challenges and implications, using excerpts {{from the perspectives of}} non-EEA migrants and health advocates in London. Methods: A qualitative study design was selected. Data were collected through document review and 22 indepth interviews with non-EEA migrants and civil-society organisation representatives. Data were analysed thematically using the NHS principles. Results: The experiences of those ‘vulnerable migrants’ (ie, defined as adult non-EEA asylum-seekers, refugees, undocumented, low-skilled, and trafficked migrants susceptible to marginalised healthcare access) able to access health services were positive, with healthcare professionals generally demonstrating caring attitudes. However, general confusion existed about entitlements due to recent NHS changes, controversy over ‘health tourism,’ and challenges registering for health services or accessing secondary facilities. Factors requiring greater clarity or improvement included <b>accessibility,</b> communication, <b>and</b> <b>clarity</b> on general practitioner (GP) responsibilities and migrant entitlements. Conclusion: Legislation to restrict access to healthcare based on immigration status could further compromise the health of vulnerable individuals in Britain. This study highlights current challenges in health services policy and practice and the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in healthcare advocacy (eg, helping the voices of the most vulnerable reach policy-makers). Thus, it contributes to broadening national discussions and enabling more nuanced interpretation of ongoing global debates on immigration and health...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedThis study {{evaluated}} drug registration {{transparency in}} three Pharmerging markets in Asia. It {{took place in}} three stages. First it used focus-group methods to evaluate a range of factors that are perceived by regulatory experts {{to be important in}} defining and affecting transparency in regulatory agencies governing pharmaceutical products. Second it created a drug registration transparency index {{in the form of a}} survey instrument whose questions were guided by three key dimensions of <b>accessibility,</b> <b>clarity</b> <b>and</b> accountability. This index was used to compare the perceived transparency of certain regulatory agencies in South Korea, China and India by surveying the views and experiences of regulatory professionals who have specialized in these global registration processes. The US was considered to be most transparent, South Korea was viewed as intermediate in transparency and China and India were considered least transparent according to the response profiles of the respondents. The survey instrument appeared to provide results consistent with the way that transparency in these countries was rank-ordered by the same respondents. Results suggested that the survey instrument was a useful tool with which to study regulatory transparency. Although further study is needed to validate this approach, the survey provides a first-of-its-kind index of drug-approval transparency based upon the three key aspects of transparency, <b>clarity,</b> <b>accessibility</b> <b>and</b> accountability. Further, the transparency index with minor changes could be adapted to study the transparency of a broader range of countries and a broader range of product categories including medical devices and in vitro diagnostics...|$|R
40|$|M. A., Language Practice, North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2010 Currently, South African editors do {{not have}} a {{prescribed}} set of professional editing standards. The absence of standards is cause for concern because it reflects the largely unregulated status of the South African editing industry. An important problem arising from the lack of standards {{is that there is no}} way in which the industry can determine the competence of its practitioners. In addition, the absence of standards also affects other areas of the industry, such as training, accreditation, regulation and professionalisation. As a consequence, editors struggle to obtain professional recognition for their work. Against this background, this study postulates that the development of standards for South African editors is possible and necessary. However, because the South African editing industry is highly diversified in terms of the various contexts in which editors may work, the development of standards needs to be based on the identification of shared or core tasks and skills that are essential for the everyday work of all editors, together with the identification of tasks and skills specific to certain sectors. This may lead to the development of a set of core standards for editors, supplemented by sector-specific standards. The focal point of this study is the first of these two aspects: the development of core standards for editors in South Africa. In order to develop core standards for South African editors, this study comprises a literature review and empirical investigation. The literature review analyses the status of the South African editing industry, and also contributes to the identification of a comprehensive list of tasks and skills involved in editing. The empirical investigation is based on a survey questionnaire (utilising the tasks and skills identified in the literature review) designed to collect data on which tasks and skills form an essential part of South African editors' work. The questionnaire was sent to a stratified sample of South African editors, reflecting the four sectors identified for the purposes of this study: editing for book publishing, editing for mass media, technical editing and academic editing. The data collected from the questionnaire was analysed utilising various statistical methods, in order to extrapolate core (or shared) tasks and skills among South African editors. These core tasks and skills were used to draft a document outlining core standards for South African editors, which was tested for <b>accessibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>clarity</b> by means of a semi-Delphi study.

40|$|The {{principle}} of transparency in EU law’ explores a variety of transparency obligations in European law, and offers a comprehensive framework to classify and understand those obligations. The {{principle of}} transparency is ubiquitous and multifaceted. The obligations derived from it range from a duty to allow access to documents held by the EU-institutions to a prohibition to change {{the terms of a}} contract concluded after a procurement procedure. But although transparency is a diffuse concept, it has a distinct core: the concept refers to the availability, <b>accessibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>clarity</b> of information. However, the concept of transparency does not in itself determine the target and the timing of transparency obligations, nor does it tell us much about the acceptability of exceptions, and whether information should be provided pro-actively or on request. The author provides a method to determine the exact nature of the transparency obligations that can be derived from the {{principle of transparency}} in concrete situations. She explains how the application of the EU principle of transparency is affected by the manner in which transparency contributes to the realisation of a variety of goals, the context in which it is applied, and the presence of conflicting interests. The key to understanding the principle of transparency is appreciating its instrumental value. By being transparent, governments can promote democracy and individual rights, and improve economic performance. These goals are realised by means of two related but distinct mechanisms. First, transparency aids people in decision-making. Second, it allows them to see what is going on inside government. As such it is a precondition for any attempt to affect what is going on inside that government. Understanding how transparency functions is insufficient though: whether there is an obligation to be transparent is determined by the normative framework that governs the relation between the government and its citizens. This framework differs depending on whether this relation is perceived as one involving the citoyen, homo economicus, or homo dignus. For the citoyen, the overarching principle governing its relation with the government is democracy. For homo economicus, it is the promotion of the internal market and the Treaty freedoms. For homo dignus, it is the respect for human rights. The contents of the principle of transparency are determined by these higher-order principles. Because of that, we can only derive those particular transparency obligations from it that do in fact contribute to the realisation of the state that is embodied in those higher order principles. Because transparency always functions in the same two distinct ways to bring about its positive effects – it facilitates decision-making and allows outsiders to see what public authorities are doing – our understanding of {{the manner in which it}} functions provides us with a way to determine what concrete transparency obligations we can derive from the principle of transparency, provided we know what effects the law requires us to achieve by its observance...|$|E

This work also correctly describes the latest techniques of cardiopulmonary resuscitation at adults. The second chapter is a small reminder of a history of the Red Cross. This chapter contains information about the beginnings of the Red Cross, {{as was the case with}} the founding of the Red Cross in the Czech Republic, dats about the International Movement of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and basic information about the possibillities of the first aid training. The fourth chapter is devoted to the basic principles of treatment for some life -threatening conditions such as: shock, unconsciousness, fractures, bleeding and how to call EMS. To learn about the <b>accessibility</b> <b>and</b> the <b>clarity</b> of the information of the first aid at the same time, I tried to borrow from the various information sources. According to the information, I decided to include above- mentioned theory in the theoretical part of the work. The second part relates the research, which has been established for one primary objective : to find out knowledge of the theory of the first aid. The research was conducted at selected colleges JCU, questionnaires were completed by 159 students. I chose respondents from these faculties intended to find the information just at these students because they represent a particular age group but also the various sectors of human activities. I further modified the sample random with the same proportion of students from the various faculties in the number of 100 respondents. There was chosen a quantitative method for this research. The necessary dats were collected by using an anonymous questionnaires. A structured questionnaire (see Appendix 1) contained a total of 22 questions focused on the theoretical knowledge of the first aid of JCU student.
