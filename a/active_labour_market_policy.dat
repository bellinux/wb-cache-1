In addition, the Housing Rents and Subsidies Act 1975 gave power over rents back to local authorities.|$|E
30|$|<b>Active</b> <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> play an {{important}} role in this endeavour. There is a long tradition of extensive use of <b>active</b> <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> in Denmark, and <b>active</b> <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> have been maintained during the Great Recession. With the increase in unemployment this means that there has been a volume increase in <b>active</b> <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policies.</b> The flipside of this is an expenditure increase, but so far it has been possible to accommodate this since there has been some fiscal space. This points to the importance of creating fiscal space in “good times” to be able to accommodate negative shocks. While it in the current situation may be difficult to find policy measures which significantly can boost job creation, it is important to maintain the <b>active</b> focus of <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> to prevent an increase in long-term and thus structural unemployment.|$|R

Each program sponsors about eight peer review meetings in each year, in which a 'host country' lays a given policy or initiative open to examination by half a dozen other countries and the relevant European-level NGOs. These usually meet over two days and include visits to local sites where the policy can be seen in operation. The meeting is preceded by the compilation of an expert report on which participating 'peer countries' submit comments. The results are published on the web.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Danish policymakers {{established}} a fiscal policy aimed at breaking the unemployment {{trend of the}} time and was further coupled to the first <b>active</b> <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> (ALMP) of 1994 which sought to reduce structural unemployment. Although some believed that the natural unemployment rate had simply increased, the Danish Government sought to improve the situation by implementing what came to be called the flexicurity model. The policy shift thus came about with the 1994 and 1996 labour market reforms, when the introduction of flexibility was linked to security through the continued provision of generous welfare schemes as well as the 'activation' of the labour force through a set of ALMPs. Activation in Denmark is regarded as [...] "a right and an obligation". The effects expected from this combination were twofold: qualification effects of the labour market policies (LMPs) as well as motivational effects through the welfare schemes.|$|E

40|$|<b>Active</b> <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> is {{a widely}} used labour market intervention, which should {{increase}} the efficiency of labour market and help increase regular employment. However, its real impacts on labour market conditions are ambiguous. Although the literature concerning effectiveness of <b>active</b> <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> (ALMP) measures is extensive, there is no conclusive evidence regarding which ALMP measures are efficient and to what extent. The effectiveness of <b>active</b> <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> depends on many circumstances including characteristics of a given measure and conditions in a corresponding labour market.

30|$|Earlier {{research}} results (Bacher et al. 2014; Bergemann and van den Berg 2006; Hofer and Weber 2006; Martin 1998) indicate that <b>active</b> <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> reduces the NEET-risk {{of women in}} {{a greater extent than}} the risk of men. For several years the Federal Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Consumer Protection calls for raising women’s share in <b>active</b> <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> to 50 % of total budget. To achieve this objective most federal states provide specific measures for the promotion of women (Lutz et al. 2013, p. 5 f). Therefore, we consider that an increase in expenditure for <b>active</b> <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> is primarily used to expand the supply of specific training courses for women to meet the 50 % target.
