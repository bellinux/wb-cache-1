Two well characterized bacterial adhesins, the O 75 X fimbriae of Escherichia coli and the type- 3 fimbriae of Klebsiellae, with in vitro affinities to type IV and V collagens, respectively, {{were used to}} test whether bacterial components with affinity for glomerular matrix could bind to glomeruli in vivo. The purified fimbrial proteins were injected into rats, and kidney samples were studied by immunofluorescence at two hours to nine months postinjection. The O 75 X, but not the type- 3 fimbriae, formed mesangial deposits that persisted for months. Preincubation of the O 75 X fimbriae with type IV collagen significantly reduced the glomerular binding. The fimbrial deposits were extracellular, as anti-O 75 X IgG injected into rats bound to glomeruli. Proteinuria or histological damage could not be detected even after passive or <b>active</b> <b>immunizations</b> of the rats. The results demonstrate that bacterial adhesins may bind in vivo to and persist in glomeruli by their specific affinities.

Importantly, the designed vaccine combining Alzheimer’s disease (AD) specific B cell epitopes with foreign (bacterial) T cell epitopes induced fast immune responses with high IgG 1 titers after prophylactic immunization that subsequently decreased over the observation period. The effectiveness of the immunization was surveyed by evaluating the animal behavior, {{as well as the}} pathology in the brain by biochemical and histochemical techniques.

Based on the good correlation between antibody titers in human sera and protection of animals, a correlate of protection was defined. This is of particular importance {{for the evaluation of}} the vaccine because of the comparatively low annual incidence of RRV disease, which renders a classical efficacy trial impractical. Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection, did not occur in mice even at low to undetectable concentrations of vaccine-induced antibodies.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Acinetobacter baumannii is {{considered}} the prototypical example of a multi- or pan- drug-resistant bacterium. It has been increasingly implicated as {{a major cause of}} nosocomial and community-associated infections. This study proposed to evaluate the efficacy of immunological approaches to prevent and treat A. baumannii infections. METHODS: Mice were immunized with outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) prepared from a clinically isolated multidrug-resistant strain of A. baumannii. Pneumonia and sepsis models were used to evaluate the efficacy of <b>active</b> and passive <b>immunization</b> with OMVs. The probable effective mechanisms and the protective potential of clonally distinct clinical isolates were investigated in vitro using an opsonophagocytic assay. RESULTS: Intramuscular immunization with OMVs rapidly produced high levels of OMV-specific IgG antibodies, and subsequent intranasal challenge with A. baumannii elicited mucosal IgA and IgG responses. Both <b>active</b> and passive <b>immunization</b> protected the mice from challenges with homologue bacteria in a sepsis model. Bacterial burden in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF), lung, and spleen, inflammatory cell infiltration in BALF and lung, and inflammatory cytokine accumulation in BALF was significantly suppressed in the pneumonia model by both <b>active</b> and passive <b>immunization</b> strategies. The antisera from immunized mice presented with significant opsonophagocytic activities in a dose-dependent manner against not only homologous strains but also five of the other six clonally distinct clinical isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing immunological characteristics of outer membrane proteins to elevate protective immunity and circumvent complex multidrug-resistance mechanisms might be a viable approach to effectively control A. baumannii infections...|$|R

Antibody responses potentiated by several adjuvants to a Plasmodium falciparum MSP 1 - 19 (C-terminal 19 -kDa processing fragment of MSP 1) vaccine were studied in gamma interferon (IFN-γ) or interleukin (IL- 4) knockout mice. The levels of anti-MSP 1 - 19 antibodies and the induction of Th 1 - and Th 2 -type antibodies were analyzed. Results revealed a spectrum of requirements for cytokine-mediated pathways in the potentiation of immunogenicity, and such requirements were influenced by interactions among individual components of the adjuvant formulations. One adjuvant strictly depended on IFN-γ to induce appreciable levels of anti-MSP 1 - 19 antibodies, while some formulations required IFN-γ only for the induction of Th 1 -type antibodies. Other formulations induced exclusively Th 2 -type antibodies and were not affected by IFN-γ knockout. There were three patterns of requirements for IL- 4 by various adjuvants in the induction of Th 2 -type anti-MSP 1 - 19 antibodies. Moreover, the induction of Th 1 -type anti-MSP 1 - 19 antibodies by adjuvants showed two distinct patterns of regulation by IL- 4. The utilization of an IL- 4 regulated pathway(s) for the induction of Th 2 -type antibodies by the same adjuvant differed between mouse strains, suggesting that animal species variability in responses to vaccine adjuvants may be due, at least in part, to differences in the utilization of immune system pathways by an adjuvant among animal hosts...|$|R

50|$|Immunotherapy or {{vaccination}} for Alzheimer's {{stimulates the}} immune system to attack beta-amyloid.

The vaccine AN-1792 showed promise in mouse and early human trials, but in a 2002 Phase II trial, 6% of subjects (18 of 300) developed serious brain inflammation resembling meningoencephalitis, and the trial was stopped. In long-term followups, 20% of subjects had developed high levels of antibodies to beta-amyloid. While placebo-patients and non-antibody responders worsened, these antibody-responders showed a degree of stability in cognitive levels as assessed by the neuropsychological test battery (although not by other measures), and had lower levels of the protein tau in their cerebrospinal fluid. These results may suggest reduced disease activity in the antibody-responder group.

Along with outer membrane proteins that are consistent among different strains of M. catarrhalis, a sort of subclass-specific IgG antibody response to certain outer membrane proteins may also exist.

40|$|Isolated outer {{membranes}} of Borrelia burgdorferi 297 {{were utilized}} to obtain partial {{amino acid sequence}} information for a low-molecular-weight, outer membrane-associated polypeptide. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers based upon this information were used to amplify a 100 -bp probe for detection of the corresponding full-length gene within a B. burgdorferi total genomic library. The relevant open reading frame (ORF) encoded a polypeptide comprised of a 17 -amino-acid putative signal peptide terminated by LFVAC, a probable consensus sequence for lipoprotein modification, and a mature protein of 51 amino acids (predicted molecular mass of 5. 8 kDa). The DNA sequences of the corresponding ORFs in B. burgdorferi 297 and B 31 were identical; the corresponding ORF in strain N 40 differed by only one nucleotide. Assuming conventional processing and acylation, the molecular weight of the lipoprotein, designated lp 6. 6, is about 6, 600. The lp 6. 6 gene, which was localized to the 49 -kb linear plasmid of B. burgdorferi, subsequently was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. Immunoblot analysis with monoclonal antibody 240. 7 revealed that lp 6. 6 was identical to a low-molecular-weight, highly conserved B. burgdorferi lipoprotein reported previously (L. I. Katona, G.

The objective of this current study is to gain insight into the opinion of vaccine services officers in the Apulia region on federal immunization and the regional immunization programme. Research was conducted using an anonymous standardized questionnaire to which 302 vaccines services staff responded. 67. 4 % of respondents believe that the current federal vaccination programme should be maintained, whilst 20. 2 % believe that the current system should be eradicated and 12. 4 % believe it should be phased out gradually.
