50|$|Prototype means <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> average {{characteristics}} of a particular subject. It can be found throughout the world.

40|$|I {{will present}} an {{argument}} for property dualism. The argument employs a distinction between having <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> property and grasping a property via <b>a</b> <b>concept.</b> If you grasp a property P via <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> C, then C is <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> P. But the reverse does not hold: you may have <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> property without grasping that property via any concept. If you grasp a property, then your cognitive relation to that property is more intimate then if you just have some <b>concept</b> or other <b>of</b> that property. To grasp a property is to understand what having that property essentially consists in. To have <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> property is to have <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> one can use to attribute the property to something. If you have the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> water then {{you can use it}} to attribute the property of being water to liquids. You then have <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> the property of being water. But you might have the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> water without knowing that being composed of H 20 is essential for being water—without knowing what having the property of being water consists in. In that case, your concept would not enable you to grasp the property. I will propose an account of grasping properties. It is quite easy to fin...|$|R

40|$|Research in {{the area}} of {{comprehension}} monitoring shows that children often fail to monitor their own comprehension. This study hypothesizes that what these poor monitors may lack is <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> understanding. <b>A</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> understanding is argued to involve aspects of information and information transfer. Thus subjects were tested on their ability to judge information adequacy, assess information perspective, ascribe understanding and describe the purpose of discourse. Children ages 3 to 7 years were tested for comprehension monitoring ability as well as for <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> understanding. Most tests showed a substantial increase in performance on measures <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> understanding and of comprehension monitoring at around age five. The two types of tasks were highly related in that high monitors were consistently superior in measures of understanding understanding. The results show that comprehension monitoring {{can be explained by the}} acquisition <b>of</b> s <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> understanding...|$|R

30|$|Like other microblogs Twitter can be {{described}} by the following five key characteristics [12]: (1) <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> shortness, due to the limitation of 140 characters for each post (hence the name microblog), (2) <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> friends (the various accounts a user follows) and followers (the accounts that follow a user), (3) <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> information presentation, where messages of friends are presented in a list with the most recent at the top, (4) <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> openness (users can set their profiles to private, but that is rather unusual; almost all posts on Twitter are public), and (5) <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> web services, meaning that Twitter allows third-party applications {{to connect with the}} service using an open application programming interface (API). This open API “provides a mechanism {{to make use of the}} functionality of a set of modules without having access to the source code or a specific license“[2] and is therefore crucial in order to conduct a Twitter data analysis by any means. In view of these characteristics, a microblog, with Twitter being its most prominent representative, can be classed as a service for a complete new way of communication.|$|R
