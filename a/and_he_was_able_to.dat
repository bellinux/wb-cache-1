5|$|Bonaparte {{restored}} Lafayette's citizenship on 1 March 1800, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> recover {{some of his}} properties. The ruler {{offered to}} make Lafayette minister to the United States, but was met with a firm refusal, as Lafayette would {{not have anything to}} do with Napoleon's government. In 1802, Lafayette was part of the tiny minority that voted no in the referendum that made Bonaparte consul for life. Bonaparte offered to appoint Lafayette to the Senate and to bestow the Legion of Honor upon him, but Lafayette declined, though he stated he would gladly have taken the honors from a democratic government.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his time}} in prison, A.I.M {{scientists}} converted Osborn into a Super-Adaptoid, capable of absorbing the abilities of any mutant, mutate, alien, android or other such super powered being by touching them. In this form he possessed considerably increased strength and durability; where he was once approximately as strong as Spider-Man, he now possessed sufficient strength to overpower and throw Luke Cage a significant distance away from him. He could also levitate, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> defeat the Vision in an aerial conflict between the two.|$|E

5|$|These successes {{established}} Steinitz {{as one of}} the world's top players, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{arrange a}} match in 1866 in London against Adolf Anderssen, who was regarded as the world's strongest active player because he had won the 1851 and 1862 London International Tournaments and his one superior, Paul Morphy, had retired from competitive chess. Steinitz won with eight wins and six losses (there were no draws), but it was a hard fight; after 12 games the scores were level at 6–6, then Steinitz won the last two games.|$|E
5|$|After marriage, Boyanus had {{to return}} to the Soviet Union for eight years, while Armstrong had to stay in England. While away, Boyanus worked with Vladimir Müller to produce English–Russian and Russian–English dictionaries. Armstrong {{assisted}} with the phonetic transcription for the keywords in the English–Russian volume. She was able to visit Boyanus in Leningrad on two occasions, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> briefly return to London in 1928. Boyanus was finally able to permanently move to England in January 1934, whereupon he became a lecturer in Russian and Phonetics at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies at the University of London. While working at University College, Armstrong lived in Forest Gate and Church End, Finchley.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of François les bas-bleus, Messager received, and accepted, {{simultaneous}} invitations to compose a ballet for the Opéra and an operetta for the Folies-Dramatiques. The operetta, La fauvette du temple, first performed on 17 November 1885, confirmed Messager's reputation. It ran well into the following year in Paris, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> sell the British rights immediately, though the work was not staged in London until 1891. The ballet, Les deux pigeons, which became one of Messager's best known works, took longer to reach the stage. It was put into rehearsal at the Opéra, but the staging, which showed a tree being struck by lightning in a storm scene, was considered a fire hazard by the police authorities, and the production was temporarily shelved.|$|E

5|$|In 1948 Kathleen married Frank Cole, a World War II veteran, {{and moved}} the family to Virginia. Godwin was further {{inspired}} by her mother's determination to continue writing after having a second child. According to Godwin, {{much of her time}} growing up was spent in the newsroom, where her mother worked. She also witnessed her mother's plays and novels being rejected. Godwin's autobiography creates the impression that much of her own writing was intended to accomplish the things her mother could not. As Cole's salary increased <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> support the family, Godwin's mother focused on being a wife and homemaker, eventually not writing at all.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} {{part of his}} NBA career, Parker was still {{considered}} an erratic shooter of the ball and during the 2005 off-season, Coach Popovich decided {{to work on this}} aspect of his play. Spurs shooting coach Chip Engelland forbade Parker to shoot any three-point shots, and among others, corrected his shooting motion and his thumb position. As a result, by the 2006–07 season, Parker had reduced his three-point shots by 117 while shooting 147 more normal field goal attempts compared to 2005, and his accuracy rose by 4% (field goals and three-point shots) <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> connect on 78% of his free throws that season. Parker's field goal percentage is also high for a point guard, and his speed also makes him a fast break player. However, his style of play has had adverse effects on his knees (tendinitis).|$|E
5|$|PerdiccasII {{sided with}} Sparta in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC) between Athens and Sparta, and in 429 BC Athens retaliated by persuading Sitalces to invade Macedonia, {{but he was}} forced to retreat owing to a {{shortage}} of provisions in winter. In 424 BC, Arrhabaeus, a local ruler of Lynkestis in Upper Macedonia, rebelled against his overlord Perdiccas, and the Spartans agreed to help in putting down the revolt. At the Battle of Lyncestis the Macedonians panicked and fled before the fighting began, enraging the Spartan general Brasidas, whose soldiers looted the unattended Macedonian baggage train. Perdiccas then changed sides and supported Athens, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> put down Arrhabaeus's revolt.|$|E

5|$|Sigurd {{was the son}} of Hlodvir Thorfinnson and (according to the Norse sagas) {{a direct}} descendent of Torf-Einarr Rognvaldson. Sigurd's tenure as earl was {{apparently}} free of the kin-strife that beset some other incumbents of this title <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> pursue his military ambitions over a wide area. He also held lands in the north of mainland Scotland and in the Sudrøyar, and he may have been instrumental in the defeat of Gofraid mac Arailt, King of the Isles. The Annals of Ulster record his death at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, the earliest known reference to the earldom of Orkney.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} for the World Tag Team Championships between La Résistance (Sylvain Grenier and Robért Conway) against Edge and Chris Benoit, the two {{individuals}} who were not chosen to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight championship. There was back and forth action between the two teams, as all the superstars were {{able to participate in}} the match. Edge abandoned Benoit during the match, which forced Benoit to wrestle La Résistance by himself. Benoit fought them off <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> get the upper hand over Grenier. The match concluded with Benoit forcing Conway to submit to the Crippler Crossface to win the title for his team.|$|E
5|$|With Marengo {{damaged and}} Rainier {{actively}} hunting for his squadron, Linois {{withdrew from the}} Bay of Bengal and returned to Isle de France. Rainier knew that his chances of discovering Linois in the open Indian Ocean were insignificant, and instead decided to keep watch for him off his principal base at Port Napoleon. A squadron was detached to the port, but Linois's scouts discovered the blockade before he arrived <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> safely reach Grand Port instead on 31 October. Entering over the reefs that protected the anchorage, Marengos deeper keel scraped on the coral. The ship's hull was badly damaged and her rudder torn off, requiring extensive repairs. Linois was later joined by Captain Bruilhac in Belle Poule, who had captured a valuable merchant ship on his individual cruise in the Bay of Bengal.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the race}} John Downie crashed into a pub in Ballasalla, but the car did not sustain {{extensive}} damage <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> continue the race. At Keppel Gate on the Mountain Road, Frederick Bennett, who {{had been unable to}} take part in the practice sessions and therefore did not know the course very well, approached a corner with too much speed in his Cadillac and crashed, ripping off two of the wheels. Bennett managed to stay in the vehicle and avoided serious injury. Another driver to go off the track was J. Hadley in his Wolseley, who also carried too much speed into a corner, leading him to drive off through a hedge and into a field. The Thornycroft driven by Tom Thornycroft had been following closely behind, and the two cars collided during the incident, damaging one of the Thornycroft's rear wheels. Napier in his Arrol-Johnston made the quickest circuit of the first lap in one hour, 32 minutes and 36 seconds.|$|E
5|$|George Villiers (23 November 1759 – 21 March 1827), styled The Honourable, was a British courtier and {{politician}} {{from the}} Villiers family. The youngest {{son of the}} diplomat Lord Hyde (later Earl of Clarendon), he was an intimate of Princess Amelia and personal supporter of her father, George III. His favour within the Royal Family and his father's influence brought him a number of sinecures to support him. However, Villiers {{was more interested in}} the operation of the royal farms at Windsor Castle than in politics or the duties of his offices. When his bookkeeping as Paymaster of the Marines was carefully examined in 1810, Villiers' carelessness and the speculation of his clerk had left him in debt to the Crown by more than £250,000. This exposure touched off a public scandal; Villiers promptly surrendered all his property to the Crown and threw himself on the king's mercy. The misconduct of Joseph Hunt as Treasurer of the Ordnance to some extent obscured Villiers' own misconduct, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> retain other sinecures and a stable, if reduced, income from them until his death in 1827.|$|E
5|$|Norman Biggs {{was born}} in Cardiff to John and Emily Biggs. His father, who lived at Park Place in {{the centre of the}} city, was a brewer by trade who owned {{businesses}} in Cardiff and Bristol. Biggs was privately educated at several proprietary schools including Lewinsdale School in Weston-super-Mare, before matriculating to University College Cardiff and later Trinity Hall, Cambridge, playing rugby for both university teams. It was reported that Biggs should have won a sporting 'Blue' while at Cambridge, but an injury to his ribs ruled him out. As well as playing rugby, Biggs was a keen sprinter <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> run 100 yards in even time, and was able to beat world sprint champion Charlton Monypenny at this distance. On returning to Cardiff he joined his father's brewing business. In 1887, Biggs played his first senior game for Cardiff RFC, in a match against Penarth. Biggs came from a large sporting family and was one of six brothers to play rugby for Cardiff. His most notable brothers were Selwyn, who also played for Wales, and Cecil, who captained Cardiff during their 1904/05 season.|$|E

5|$|Pattle joined No. 80 Squadron RAF. The {{squadron}} was in {{the midst}} of re-forming at RAF Kenley <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> fly the Gloster Gladiator fighter for the first time in May 1937. In June, the unit moved to RAF Debden. Here, they practised aerial combat against RAF Bomber Command squadrons which staged mock raids against London. During these exercises, he mastered deflection shooting. Pattle developed his own air tactics. He preferred attacking at higher altitudes than his quarry, meeting head-on, then waiting for the enemy to fly by before rolling over and diving to attack from the side and rear of the enemy. He usually held his fire until very close to the target to make sure of hitting his opponent. His qualities as an officer led to him being promoted to squadron adjutant. A gifted flyer and natural marksman, he took pains to improve both talents, doing exercises to improve his distance vision and sharpen his reflexes. He progressed in rank with the squadron and was duly promoted to pilot officer on 27 July 1937.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1987–88 season Vanbiesbrouck {{was hit by}} a puck {{under his}} mask in practice, which caused a non-displaced {{fracture}} of his lower jaw and a broken tooth. Fortunately for him the injury did not require his jaw to be wired shut, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> return to practice the next day. He showed no ill effects from the injury, playing in 56 games, winning 27. On June 13, 1988 Vanbiesbrouck suffered nerve damage to his left wrist after a glass coffee table he was sitting on collapsed and broken glass lacerated his ulnar nerve and three tendons. He was sitting on the table assembling video equipment in anticipation of the birth of his first child. The glass broke beneath him, and as he braced for the fall, his wrist was cut by the glass. Vanbiesbrouck required five hours of microsurgery to remove glass from his wrist and repair the nerve and tendon damage. He was initially expected to miss 4–6 months, but he recovered in time to attend the Rangers pre-season training camp just 3 months later. Again he played in 56 games, and increased his win total to 28.|$|E
5|$|When the German {{offensive}} had begun, Hill {{had been}} in hospital, undergoing reconstructive plastic surgery; this meant that {{he was unable to}} join the 3rd Parachute Brigade for two days. When he had recovered, however, he and his batman were flown to the Ardennes <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> rejoin the brigade. The 5th Parachute Brigade launched several attacks against German positions in the village of Bure, which resulted in heavy British casualties, and both brigades conducted a large number of offensive patrols. The 3rd Parachute Brigade did not see any action, as those German units occupying positions opposite to it withdrew without fighting. By the end of January, however, the division was transferred back to the Netherlands and set up new positions along the Maas river, where it conducted more patrolling against elements of the German 7th Parachute Division, which held positions {{on the other side of}} the Maas. These operations came to an end in late February, when the 6th Airborne Division was withdrawn back to England to prepare for a major airborne operation in March.|$|E
