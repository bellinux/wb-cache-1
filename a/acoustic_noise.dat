40|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive neuroimaging modality used to study brain function by acquiring a volumetric time series. Various types of noise such as system noise and physiological noise are significant confounds in fMRI experiments that must be characterized and corrected to improve experimental results. ^ A source of noise in variable repetition time fMRI is gradient coil heating and eddy currents. Typically, fMRI experiments use a constant repetition time (TR) for the acquisition of a volumetric time series, but variable TR experiments have been employed that enables researchers to perform studies not feasible with a constant TR. With a variable TR paradigm, volumes are collected at non-uniform time intervals, causing the temperature state of the gradient coils and eddy currents to vary {{as a function of}} TR. The resulting signal fluctuations represent an observable and deleterious confound for variable TR fMRI. This confound was characterized in this work using a novel radio-frequency disabled gradient sequence paradigm, and a modified projection method was developed to effectively correct for these adverse signal fluctuations. ^ Another source of artifactual signal fluctuations in fMRI data is <b>acoustic</b> imaging <b>noise</b> produced from audible vibrations of gradient coils during image acquisition. This <b>acoustic</b> imaging <b>noise</b> not only interferes with the subject’s perception of desired stimuli in auditory fMRI, but also induces hemodynamic responses that interfere with the desired responses. In order to develop a compensation procedure for <b>acoustic</b> imaging <b>noise,</b> the hemodynamic response arising from pure <b>acoustic</b> imaging <b>noise</b> must first be characterized as a function of noise duration as well as noise intensity. Results show that the human auditory cortex exhibited increased response amplitude as well as response spatial extent to <b>acoustic</b> imaging <b>noise</b> of longer duration and intensity. Responses were strongly nonlinear for brief duration <b>acoustic</b> imaging <b>noise,</b> but became approximately linear with longer duration <b>acoustic</b> imaging <b>noise.</b> Improved characterization of hemodynamic responses to <b>acoustic</b> imaging <b>noise</b> and assessment of response linearity conducted in this work will enhance the ability to model responses under a variety of acoustic conditions in auditory fMRI, potentially enabling the development of a model to account for losses in sensitivity arising from the adverse interaction of acoustic imaging noise-induced responses with desired stimulus-induced responses. ...|$|R
