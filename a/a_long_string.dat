The tropical moisture acted in tandem with wind shear and a monsoonal flow to produce continuous precipitation over the Malaysian states of Pahang, Johor, and Malacca. Rainfall peaked at 567.8mm (22.35in) in Bandar Muadzam Shah over a four-day period, with similar rainfall totals occurring elsewhere. These floods were considered {{the worst in the}} history of southern Malaysia. The worst-affected areas were Segamat and Kota Tinggi, where both towns were inaccessible by land after all main roads leading to those towns were flooded. Eight fatalities resulted from the historical flooding.|$|E

Hostilities between the Tang and Tibet continued until they signed a formal peace treaty in 821.

40|$|For every string {{inclusion}} relation {{there are}} two optimization problems: nd <b>a</b> <b>longest</b> <b>string</b> included in every string of a given nite language, and nd a shortest string including every string of a given nite language. As an example, the two well-known pairs of problems, the longest common substring (or subsequence) problem and the shortest common superstring (or supersequence) problem, are interpretations of these two problems. In this paper we consider a class of opposite problems connected with string non-inclusion relations: nd a shortest string included in no string of a given nite language and nd <b>a</b> <b>longest</b> <b>string</b> including no string of a given nite language.

With troops from Khotan they conquered Aksu, upon which the Chinese abandoned the region, ending two decades of Chinese control. They thus gained control over all of the Chinese Four Garrisons of Anxi in the Tarim Basin in 670 and held them until 692, when the Chinese finally managed to regain these territories.|$|E
