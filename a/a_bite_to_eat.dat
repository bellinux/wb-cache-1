2500|$|Events {{taking place}} in Hispania (Islamic rule, the adoptionist heresy, the gradual {{assimilation}} of the Mozarabs) were, for Beatus, signals of the imminent apocalyptic aeon. As Elipandus describes in his Letter from the bishops of Spania to their brothers in Gaul, the abbot of Santo Toribio {{went so far as}} to announce to his countrymen the coming of the End of Time in the Easter of the year 800. On the dawn of that day, hundreds of peasants met around the abbey of Santo Toribio, waiting terrified for the fulfilling of the prophecy. They remained in that place, without having had <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> during a day and half, until one of them, named Ordonius, exclaimed: [...] "Let us eat and drink, so that if the End of the World comes we are full!".|$|E

When asked why, he tells {{how he and his}} fellow Loup Garou worked for their demonic vampire-like soul gambler of a master, and did the work of greedy men who bargained their souls for lives of leisure. As Biscuit's master left Biscuit to go make a meal, the evil man claimed his next soul, turning a man who sold his soul, into a werewolf slave. At this time Biscuit made a run for it and hid at the mansion for the night. The next day instead of going to be a human again, he found that he would be trapped at the mansion forever as a wolf, as a punishment for running away. He doesn't mind except he can't get <b>a</b> decent <b>bite</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> Even the fish are ghosts! ...|$|R

40|$|My {{inspiration}} for this love seat was the beautiful mountain sunsets we see {{almost every day}} at Liberty University. I love how the dark mountains stand out against the brilliant oranges, pinks, and purples of the sky. I chose to add the curvature of the backrest to resemble {{the rise and fall}} of the mountains. While this is a fun design element it also helps to clearly define the two seats of the chair. I chose not to use legs for this piece of furniture as legs would make it easier for things to roll underneath. From my experience as a college student we tend to drop things a lot, and the harder it is for something to get under a piece of furniture the better! As evidenced in the drawing, I have added tables to each arm. Many times college students are looking for a place to sit to work on homework or have <b>a</b> quick <b>bite</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> Having <b>a</b> table makes it much easier to do either of these things. My fabrics were selected from Mayer Fabrics. The seat and chair back are Fairy Tales Puss ‘N Boots #WC 963 - 004. This fabric corresponds to the curve of the backrest and my idea of mountain inspiration. However, instead of having the pattern run vertically as it does in the examples on the website, I would like it to run horizontally. The arm rests are Silverweave Tangerine. This orange most closely resembled the brilliant orange of the sky at sunset. I thought these two colors and fabrics worked well together to create the design I envisioned. Below are pictures of the fabrics along with links to the website. Drawings of the chair are in separate attachments...|$|R
40|$|College {{students}} are often pushed towards fast foods {{as a means}} of getting <b>a</b> pleasurable, quick <b>bite</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> Fast foods are high in fat, salt, and sugar content and can lead to cardiovascular disease(CVD) risk. Honors students may be more conscious of negative effects of bad dietary choices. Objectives include assessing Honors students knowledge of American Dietary Association nutritional recommendations and analyzing association between fast food consumption and CVD risk factors: physical inactivity, stress level, BMI, and family history of CVD and CVD risks. An 18 -question survey was administered between April and June 2013 to East Carolina University Honors College students via the Honors College list serve. The survey measured frequency of fast food, sweetened beverage and snack consumption; height, weight, exercise frequency, stress levels, course load, and family history of CVD, and nutritional knowledge. Students were categorized as frequent fast food consumers (FFF) 3 or more times a week or infrequent fast food consumers (IFF) less than 3 times a week. 92 responses representing 36. 2 % of the 2012 - 2013 Honors College were collected. Twenty-three percent of participants were male, 79. 3 % White, 13 % Asian, 5. 4 % Black descent, and 2 % Other. Thirty-seven percent were able to correctly identify their nutritional recommendations. IFF were able to answer 2 out of 3 nutritional questions correctly versus only 30 % of FFF. A fifth(21. 7 %) of participants had 3 or more CVD risks. Thirty percent of FFF had 3 or more cardiovascular disease risk factors versus 18. 8 % of IFF. Frequent fast food consumers had more risk factors compared to IFF. Students who answered nutritional questions correctly also consumed less fast food, demonstrating that they applied their knowledge <b>to</b> their own <b>eating</b> habits...|$|R
