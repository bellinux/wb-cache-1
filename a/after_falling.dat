5|$|Striding Edge is {{a notorious}} {{accident}} spot among hikers and scramblers. In winter conditions the climb from Striding Edge {{up to the}} summit plateau can involve crossing steep icy ground and a snow cornice, and {{can be the most}} dangerous part of the walk. Without an ice axe or crampons this presents a serious obstacle. In January 2008 two walkers died <b>after</b> <b>falling</b> from the ridge in separate incidents.

Patients and methods: This population-based case–control study identified two groups from a nationwide claim database (National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan) : a rural group and a non-rural group, which included 3, 897 and 5, 541 older people, respectively, who were hospitalized for accidental falls (The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification: E 880 –E 888) during 2006 – 2009. Both groups were followed up for 4 years <b>after</b> <b>falls.</b> Four-year cumulative all-cause mortality rate <b>after</b> <b>falls</b> was calculated, and the demographic factor, comorbidity, and medications were considered as the potential risk factors of mortality <b>after</b> <b>falls.</b> Results: The rural group had a significantly higher frequency of fall-related hospitalizations (7. 4 % vs 4. 3 %, P< 0. 001), but a lower 4 -year cumulative all-cause mortality rate <b>after</b> <b>falls</b> than the non-rural group (8. 8 % vs 23. 4 %, P< 0. 001). After adjusting for age, gender, comorbidity, and medication use, the rural group had a significantly lower risk of mortality <b>after</b> <b>falls</b> than the non-rural group (adjusted odds ratio = 0. 32, 95 % confidence interval = 0. 28 – 0. 37, P< 0. 001). Age, gender, place of residence, comorbidity, number of medications, and inappropriate medication use were independent risk factors of mortality <b>after</b> <b>falls.</b> Conclusion: The rural older people had a higher frequency of fall-related hospitalizations but lower mortality <b>after</b> <b>falls</b> than the non-rural older people. Fall prevention programs should be adjusted for difference in place of residence. Keywords: accidental falls, mortality, risk factors, rural populatio...|$|R
