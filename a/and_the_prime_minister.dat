5|$|In mid-12th century, the Kalachuris {{successfully}} warred {{against their}} overlords, the Western Chalukyas, and annexed their capital Kalyani. During this turbulent period lasting three decades (11531183), Veerashaivism gained popularity. According to H.S. Shiva Prakash, the Kalachuri period {{is one of}} the high points of medieval Kannada literature. Basavanna (or Basava), a social reformer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> of Kalachuri King Bijjala II, is generally regarded as the inspiration behind this movement.

5|$|The British {{government}} had trusted that America would share nuclear technology, which the British {{saw as a}} joint discovery. On 9 November 1945, Mackenzie King <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister,</b> Clement Attlee went to Washington, D.C., to confer with President Harry Truman about future cooperation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power. The three leaders agreed {{that there would be}} full and effective cooperation on atomic energy, but British hopes for a full resumption of cooperation on nuclear weapons were disappointed. The Americans soon made it clear that this was restricted to basic scientific research.|$|E
5|$|The Delhi Flying Club, {{established}} in 1928 with two de Havilland Moth aircraft named Delhi and Roshanara, was based at Safdarjung Airport which started operations in 1929, {{when it was}} the Delhi's only airport and the second in India. The airport functioned until 2001, however in January 2002 the government closed the airport for flying activities because of security concerns following the New York attacks in September 2001.

5|$|There {{are three}} types of {{government}} systems in European politics: in a presidential system, the president {{is the head of}} state and the head of government; in a semi-presidential system, the president <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> share a number of competences; finally, in a parliamentary republic, the president is a ceremonial figurehead who has few political competences. As with the definition of constitutional monarchies, sometimes the president does have non-ceremonial competences, but does not use them by constitutional convention; this is the case in Austria, for instance.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{memoirs of}} Ken Flower, then the {{director}} of Rhodesia's Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), Harper's downfall {{was the result of}} an extramarital affair with a young secretary in the Rhodesian civil service who the CIO discovered was an agent for MI6. Flower informed Smith of this on 3 July <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> demanded Harper's resignation that afternoon; Harper acquiesced the next day. Because this was kept secret (presuming it is true), Harper's sudden departure from the Cabinet was interpreted by many observers at the time as the culmination of the personal and political rivalry between Smith and Harper, or the result of disagreements over the new constitution.|$|E

5|$|After Lavasani's {{body had}} been recovered, Sir David McNee, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, {{contacted}} the Home Secretary to request approval to hand control of the operation over to the British Army, under the provisions of Military Aid to the Civil Power. Whitelaw relayed the request to Thatcher, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> agreed immediately. Thus John Dellow, the ranking police officer at the embassy, signed {{over control of the}} operation to Lieutenant Colonel Mike Rose at 19:07, authorising Rose to order an assault at his discretion. Meanwhile, the police negotiators began stalling Oan. They offered concessions in order to distract him and prevent him killing further hostages, buying time for the SAS to make its final preparations for the now-inevitable assault.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 31 October 1991, the {{squadron}} sailed out of Dubrovnik {{to meet the}} Libertas convoya fleet of civilian vessels, the largest among them being the Jadrolinija shipping line's Slavija, which was endeavoring to deliver humanitarian aid to the city under siege. The fleet sailed from Rijeka and made several port calls, growing to 29 vessels as it approached Dubrovnik. The convoy, accompanied by the last President of Yugoslavia Stjepan Mesić <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> of Croatia Franjo Gregurić, was stopped and searched by the Yugoslav Navy off the island of Mljet before {{the squadron}} linked up with the convoy and escorted it to Dubrovnik. The event marked the first large delivery of aid to the city {{since the beginning of}} the siege.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Constantine I {{followed}} a formal policy of neutrality, {{yet he was}} openly benevolent towards Germany, which was fighting alongside Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire against the Triple Entente of Russia, France and Britain. Constantine was the brother-in-law of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and had also {{become something of a}} Germanophile following his military training in Prussia. His pro-German attitude provoked a split between the monarch <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prime</b> <b>minister,</b> Eleftherios Venizelos, who wanted to support the Entente in the hope of expanding Greek territory to incorporate the Greek minorities in the Ottoman Empire and the Balkans. Protected by the countries of the Entente, particularly France, in 1916 Venizelos formed a parallel government to that of the king.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} to follow, public revelations {{on the state of}} Charles and Diana's {{marriage}} continued. Even though support for republicanism in Britain seemed higher {{than at any time in}} living memory, republicanism was still a minority viewpoint, and the Queen herself had high approval ratings. Criticism was focused on the institution of the monarchy itself and the Queen's wider family rather than her own behaviour and actions. In consultation with her husband <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister,</b> John Major, as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, and her private secretary, Robert Fellowes, she wrote to Charles and Diana at the end of December 1995, saying that a divorce was desirable.|$|E
5|$|Not {{having been}} {{involved}} in the coup d'état, Rainilaiarivony provided direction for his brother {{and the rest of the}} court as they grappled with the gravity of their acts. He proposed that future monarchs would no longer have absolute power but would instead rule by the consent of the nobles. A series of terms were proposed by Rainilaiarivony that the nobles agreed to impose on Radama's widow, Rasoherina. Under Rainilaiarivony's new monarchy, a sovereign required the consent of the nobles to issue a death sentence or promulgate a new law, and was forbidden to disband the army. The new power sharing agreement was concluded by a political marriage between the queen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister.</b>|$|E
