500|$|Youkilis's error-less streak {{at the end}} of {{the regular}} season was 190 games; while he was charged with an error in the sixth inning of an October 16, 2007, playoff game against the Cleveland Indians, postseason games are not {{included}} in the record. Youkilis said, [...] "I'm not worried about making the error. I'm worried about trying to help the team win and trying to get an out <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> can." [...] Leading the league with a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage, and an AL-record 1,079 error-less chances at first, Youkilis won the 2007 AL Gold Glove award for first basemen.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of Dallas, Jacobs' {{presented}} his initial idea again and created Knots Landing, with some alterations of his original script. In an interview, Jacobs explained: [...] " [...] Well, that's pretty good, but you know-and then {{he pulled out the}} pages that we'd left for them a few years ago on Knots Landing, or a year before on Knots, and he said, 'Is there <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> can make this a spin-off?' [...] I just took one of the couples and made it, you know, Val and Gary who had already been created on the parent series and putting them into the mix, but when you have four couples and you change one, you sort of have to change the dynamic all the way around. However, once I wrote the script, remarkably little changed from the script and the pilot as you would see it." [...] Gary Ewing was originally played by actor David Ackroyd, but Ackroyd was unable to sign on for the spin-off, and Ted Shackelford assumed the role. Initially, it was presumed that Charlene Tilton would be joining Knots Landing as Gary and Val's daughter, but the network decided to keep her on Dallas {{in order to keep the}} two shows separate. She did, however, make a guest appearance in the first season.|$|E

2500|$|One {{show from}} June 1971 {{featured}} a debate between future senator and presidential candidate John Kerry and fellow veteran John O'Neill over the Vietnam War.

2500|$|The Nature Relatedness {{measure is}} a 21-item scale that {{measures}} how connected to nature participants feel at a trait level. Participants indicate their agreement with each statement using a Likert scale. There are 3 subscales to this measure; NR- self, NR- perspective, and NR- experience. NR-self measures how much individuals identify with nature (e.g., “I feel very connected to {{all living things}} and the earth”), NR-perspective measures how concerned individuals may feel {{about the effect of}} human actions on the environment (e.g., “Humans have the right to use natural resources <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> want”), and NR- Experience measures how comfortable individuals are in nature and their desire to be involved with nature (e.g., “I enjoy being outdoors, even in unpleasant weather”). This scale shows good reliability, alpha = [...]87 and test-retest stability six months later, alpha = [...]85. There is also a brief Nature Relatedness Scale made up of 6 items from the original 21 items. The purpose of this scale is to measure how connected an individual feels to nature but in a shorter way. This scale shows good reliability, alpha = [...]87 and test-retest stability six months later, alpha = [...]88.|$|E
