In February 1934 Briskin was named {{as the chairman of}} the Research Council of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). The following month Briskin was also appointed to the finance committee overseeing the Research Council. By 1934, Briskin's brother, Irving, was one of the Columbia's unit producers.|$|E
5|$|When the Empire of Brazil began aiding Uruguay in its {{struggle}} against Argentina, Rosas declared war in August 1851, starting the Platine War. This short conflict ended with Rosas being defeated and <b>absconding</b> to Britain. His last years were spent in exile {{living as a}} tenant farmer {{until his death in}} 1877. Rosas garnered an enduring public perception among Argentines as a brutal tyrant. Since the 1930s, an authoritarian, anti-Semitic, and racist political movement in Argentina called Revisionism has tried to improve Rosas's reputation and establish a new dictatorship in the model of his regime. In 1989, his remains were repatriated by the government in an attempt to promote national unity, seeking forgiveness for him and especially for the 1970s military dictatorship. Rosas remains a controversial figure in Argentina in the 21st century.|$|E

25|$|R. romandi, {{along with}} other swarm-founding wasps, can be quite {{aggressive}} during the swarming process. They are aggressive towards humans, non-nestmates, and to each other. Aggressiveness towards humans may result in stings, while aggressiveness towards other wasps involves biting of the body, legs or wings. Workers are more often the aggressors, while queens are more often the victims. In R. romandi, workers do not always act out against non-nestmates. If different colonies of R. romandi are introduced to each other during the <b>absconding</b> process, they will cluster together and relatively little violence is exhibited against non-nestmate queens at this stage. If a queen is introduced after new colony formation, however, she will be vigorously attacked. It has been hypothesized that this means that R. romandi workers test out different queens during the <b>absconding</b> process.|$|E

ED also questioned TMC MPs Ahmad Hassan and Arpita Ghosh about their financial transactions with Saradha Group. ED alleged that West Bengal police has not cooperated with it and obstructed its investigation.|$|E
25|$|That same year, French privateers {{attacked}} the Turks, burning ships and <b>absconding</b> {{with a large}} sloop.

By 1815, the United States, the primary client for Turks salt, had been at war with Britain (and hence Bermuda) for three years, and had established other sources of salt.|$|E

25|$|Arrested {{again on}} 23 September 1923, Bhupen was {{deported}} to Mandalay in Burma, where Subhash Bose was {{to join him}} soon after and offer him Memories of a Revolutionist by Kropotkin that he had smuggled for Bhupen during his last trip to Europe. Even inside his solitary prison cell, Bhupen was contacted by some Burmese {{as well as a}} few Bengali revolutionaries <b>absconding</b> in Burma and, thanks to his guidance, they formed an important organisation with branches all over the country; they, along with their leader Jiten Ghosh, were arrested only in 1931, during the Burmese revolt.|$|E
25|$|During the <b>absconding</b> process, the workers, {{rather than}} the queen, choose the new nesting site, {{behaviour}} characteristic of independent founding species. It has been hypothesized that the process is mediated by pheromones. During their {{search for a new}} nesting site, R. romandi workers have been observed to exhibit a behavior called ‘metasomal dragging’. This means that the wasp drags its metasome or gaster, the second abdominal segment and sections posterior to it, along objects on which it lands. These objects are usually leaves, rocks, or man made structures. There are glands {{on the underside of the}} gaster that leave a scent behind for the other workers and the queens to follow. Wasps that didn't exhibit metasomal dragging can often be seen inspecting objects with their antennae, presumably following the scent trail. This pheromone path helps recruit all other members of the colony to the new nesting site. Visual information may also be very important during the R. romandi <b>absconding</b> process, and may even be the ultimate signal identifying the new nesting site. As wasps continue to make their way to the new nesting site, they can be seen orienting themselves to aerial swarms that had formed around the new site. This orientation to aerial swarms has been observed in the absence of continued metasomal dragging as well, leading to the hypothesis that the visual cue of the aerial swarm is the indication of the final nesting site.|$|E
25|$|Released in 1928, Bhupen {{resumed his}} usual multifarious role of {{maintaining}} contacts with various Jugantar leaders from Surya Sen in Chittagong to Bhagat Singh in Punjab (who {{had been in}} constant touch with Bhupen since 1923), editing the party organ Swadhinata, making bombs, collecting arms and distributing them, looking after the volunteer movement. Busy sheltering the <b>absconding</b> revolutionaries of the Chittagong Armoury Raid, Bhupen was arrested again in 1930, {{for a period of}} eight years. During 1938-41 and 1946-51 he edited the weekly Forward : his editorials were read with interest by patriots of all political trends. In 1946 his collection of essays, Indian Revolution and the Constructive Programme appeared with a foreword by Dr Rajendra Prasad, the first president of future independent India. In the meantime, in 1941, Bhupen was again detained till 1946.|$|E

25|$|Tryon showed {{concern for}} the {{wellbeing}} of his men and the better ordering of the Navy. Before Raleigh had left England, thirty men had deserted from the ship, and more {{took the opportunity to}} escape from ships of the squadron at Montevideo. Tryon wrote a memo to the Admiralty recommending that the penalties for desertion should be reduced, suggesting that a number of those deserting were of little use to the navy and should be let go, while others who were good seamen, but who had some urgent personal reason for <b>absconding,</b> were afraid to return later because of the severe penalties. He also instituted a programme of weighing his men and ensuring they got enough food, noting that if, as frequently happened on board ship, the men weighed less by the end of a tour than at the start, then likely their strength and fitness was reduced too. He instituted a 'dry canteen' on board to try to improve their diet.|$|E
25|$|After {{somewhat}} {{more than a}} year, on 21 February 2013 CBI arrested Gujarat IPS officer G. L. Singhal who was then Assistant Commissioner of the Police Crime Branch {{at the time of}} the incident, in connection with the alleged fake encounter. The CBI in its FIR alleged that Singhal, now Superintendent of Police at State Crime Records Bureau played an active role in the encounter which was later found to be fake by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by the Gujarat High Court. Besides Singhal, CBI had previously arrested senior police officers, Tarun Barot, J. G. Parmar, N. K. Amin, Bharat Patel and Anaju Chaudhary. Though when, even after the mandatory 90 days CBI didn't file their chargesheet in the case, all the accused were released on bail, except Amin. A CBI court, issued an arrest warrant for another accused Additional DGP (Crime) P. P. Pandey, who is <b>absconding,</b> though he has filed an appeal in the Supreme Court to get the FIR cancelled.|$|E
25|$|The USCA {{observed}} {{the following three}} causal factors for judicial delays: (1)lack of implementing legislation or procedures for Convention applications and many Mexican judges following inapposite procedures found in state civil codes in resolving such cases; (2) {{lack of understanding of}} the Convention by many Mexican judges, as evidenced by extensive requests for information, including letters under Article 15 of the Convention from the USCA to confirm that a particular case involved an international child abduction as defined by the Convention; and (3) TPs <b>absconding</b> with the children when summoned to a hearing because they were notified of the hearing but neither they nor the children were secured in any way. The USCA has observed that a tool for securing children in the Mexican system is for the judge to place the child temporarily in a children’s protection service (Desarrollo Integral de la Familia, or DIF) shelter while the case is being processed, but judges are reluctant to place children in these shelters unless the TP is determined to be a clear danger to the child.|$|E

25|$|The Coen brothers' next film, O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), {{was another}} {{critical}} and commercial success. The title was {{borrowed from the}} Preston Sturges film Sullivan's Travels (1941), whose lead character, movie director John Sullivan, had planned {{to make a film}} with that title. Based loosely on Homer's Odyssey (complete with a cyclops, sirens, et al.), the story is set in Mississippi in the 1930s and follows a trio of escaped convicts who, after <b>absconding</b> from a chain gang, journey home to recover bank-heist loot the leader has buried—but they have no clear perception of where they are going. The film highlighted the comic abilities of George Clooney as the oddball lead character Ulysses Everett McGill, and of Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro, his sidekicks. The film's bluegrass and old-time soundtrack, offbeat humor and digitally desaturated cinematography made it a critical and commercial hit. It was the first feature film to use all-digital color grading. The film's soundtrack CD was also successful, spawning a concert and concert/documentary DVD, Down from the Mountain, that coincided with a resurgence in interest in American folk music.|$|E
