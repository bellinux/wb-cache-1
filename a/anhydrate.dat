40|$|Co-crystallizations of some 3, 5 and 6 mono-substituted {{salicylic}} acids with 4 -aminopyridine, using {{a variety}} of solvents, have yielded a number of new complex solid forms, mainly with the 5 -halide-substituted acid, including some hydrates and solvates. In all cases, proton transfer occurs from the carboxyl group of the acid to the pyridine nitrogen of the base, with the COO?H+NPy synthon being found in 12 / 14 cases. The prime exception is 4 -aminopyridinium: 5 -aminosalicylate:pyridine solvate, where the carboxylate group forms a 2 -point synthon with one hydrogen of the 4 -amino group on the aminopyridinium supplemented by a C–HO interaction involving an ortho hydrogen. This synthon is also found as one component of a disordered structure of the 4 -aminopyridinium: 5 -chlorosalicylate. The other component adopts the normal pyridiniumcarboxylate synthon. The adoption of 2 -point or 1 -point synthons, and the geometry of the former, is influenced by the presence of other hydrogen-bonding interactions involving hydrate water molecules or the amine of the 4 -aminopyridinium group. A detailed packing analysis shows a number of similarities, partly linked to the synthon geometries. The structures generally fall into two groups, one derived from a simple zero-dimensional pyridinium–carboxylate monomer construct, the other from a zero-dimensional pyridinium–carboxylate centrosymmetric dimer construct.

However, a detailed description about these processes remains incomplete. In order to obtain a better chemical characterization of the SML, in a case study three pairs of SML and corresponding bulk water samples were taken in the southern Baltic Sea. The samples were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon and dissolved total nitrogen, as well as for several organic nitrogen containing compounds and carbohydrates, namely aliphatic amines, dissolved free amino acids, dissolved free monosaccharides, sugar alcohols, and monosaccharide <b>anhydrates.</b> Therefore, reasonable analytical procedures with respect to desalting and enrichment were established. All aliphatic amines and the majority of the investigated amino acids (11 out of 18) were found in the samples with average concentrations between 53 ng L– 1 and 1574 ng L– 1. The concentrations of carbohydrates were slightly higher, averaging 2900 ng L– 1. Calculation of the enrichment factor (EF) between the sea surface microlayer and the bulk water showed that dissolved total nitrogen was more enriched (EF: 1. 1 and 1. 2) in the SML than dissolved organic carbon (EF: 1. 0 and 1. 1). The nitrogen containing organic compounds were generally found to be enriched in the SML (EF: 1. 9 – 9. 2), whereas dissolved carbohydrates were not enriched or even depleted (EF: 0. 7 – 1. 2).

Two <b>anhydrates</b> (Forms I and II), three solvates, and an amorphous form {{have been}} previously mentioned. This study reports the crystal structures of Forms I (1) and II (2). These structures illustrate the uncommon phenomenon of tautomeric polymorphism. TCB exists as two tautomers A and B. Form I (Z'= 2) {{is composed of}} two molecules of tautomer A while Form II (Z'= 1) contains a 1 : 1 mixture of A and B. The polymorphs are also characterized by using other solid-state techniques (differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), PXRD, FT-IR, and NMR spectroscopy). Form I is the higher melting form (m. p. : 177 degrees C, Delta Hf=approximate to 105 +/- 4 Jg- 1) and is the more stable form at room temperature. Form II is the lower melting polymorph (m. p. : 166 degrees C, Delta Hf=approximate to 86 +/- 3 Jg- 1) and shows high kinetic stability on storage {{in comparison to the}} amorphous form but it transforms readily into Form I in a solution-mediated process.

The protein contents of deffated cowpea lour and copea protein isolate were 21. 91 and 69. 72 % on fresh weight basis, respectively. The protein content of the wheat flour mixed with untreated and treated (chemically and enzymatically) isolates increased with increasing the level of isolates addition. Cowpea protein isolate contained most essential amino acids in amount adequate to daily intakes of preschool children except for methionine. Methionine is the limiting amino acid in cowpea protein isolate. The amino acid composition of cowpea protein isolate was not affected markedly by enzymatic and chemical treatments. The addition of untreated and treated cowpea protein isolates to wheat flour increased lysine content in all mixtures and the increase rate was proportional to the amount of isolate added. Addition of untreated cowpea protein isolate to wheat flour improved farinograph parameters of wheat flour dough at all levels of addition, whereas chemically treated isolate adversely affected these parameters except pepsin/pancreatin treatment at 5 % level which paralleled farinogram parameters of the control. Extensigraph parameters reduced for all mixture samples compared to the control. However, cowpea protein isolate treated with pepsin/pancreatin and added to wheat flour at 5 and 10 % level balanced extensibility values and improved these parameters. Addition of untreated cowpea protein isolate to wheat flour reduced maximum viscosity temperatures (amylogram parameters), whereas chemically and pepsin/pancreatin treated isolates increased maximum viscosity and maximum viscosity temperature of wheat flour mixtures samples compared to the control.

The finer pore pressure distribution along with the poor pore connectivity that Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) exhibits keeps the free and chemically bound water trapped inside the structure leading to a growth in pore pressure. The buildup pressure resulted in the explosive spalling of the concrete particularly at W/B ranging between 0. 30 to 0. 35 at 30 % of blended POFA and PBC. Thus, This research work focus {{on the effectiveness of}} both POFA and PBC blended at 0. 42 W/B mainly against elevated temperature. The replacement percentages of POFA and PBC are 0 / 0 % (C 1 as control mix concrete), 5 / 5 % (C 2), 10 / 10 % (C 3), 15, 15 % (C 4) and 20 / 20 % (C 5). The residual compressive strength of SCC after exposure to elevated temperatures at 100, 300, 600 and 800 °C was noted. The results revealed that SCC mixes containing higher replacement percentages exhibited excellent workability. For compressive and splitting tensile strength, it was found that C 2 and C 3 mixes exceeded the strength of control mix at 56 days by 12 %, 19 % respectively while C 4 and C 5 showed lower values than control mix.

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Dapsone (DDS) is {{currently}} {{used in the}} treatment of leprosy and prophylaxis of opportunistic bacterial infections in immune-compromised patients. Despite the age of this drug; not much is known about the interrelationships between its polymorphs. Also, no previous polymorphic screening studies have been done to determine the probability of solvate formation when exposed to various solvents. Re-evaluation of DDS using modern techniques and equipment such as a variable temperature x-ray diffractometer (VTXRD) and modulated temperature differential scanning calorimeter (MTDSC) were crucial to clarify some aspects of DDS’s polymorphs that were published in the past. Recrystallisation of DDS from various neat solvents was done; the products that formed from recrystallisation included some habit modifications, a hydrate and three solvates. The solid-solid phase transition of DDS form III to form II was observed at ~ 82 °C for most recrystallised products. Most of the recrystallised products melted at ~ 177. 6 °C which is the melting point of DDS form II. Some of the recrystallised products melted at ~ 179. 5 °C (DDS form I). DDS•(0. 33) H 2 O has been described before by several research groups. A hydrate would be even less water soluble than the <b>anhydrated</b> DDS and was therefore not pursued further. DDS solvates have not been reported before in any literature. Solvates recrystallised from dichloromethane (DCM), 1, 4 -dioxane (DXN) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) in stoichiometric relationships of DDS• 0. 5 (DCM), DDS•DXN and DDS•THF. The crystal structures of the solvates were elucidated using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The results were deposited into the Cambridge structural database (CSD) for future reference regarding DDS. The desolvation of these solvates was extensively studied. The activation energy (Ea) and kinetic model that each solvate followed during desolvation was calculated by isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and verified by micrographs obtained by using a thermal microscope (TM). The nucleation and growth model (A 2) was statistically chosen to explain the desolvation process for DDS• 0. 5 (DCM) although the involvement of the geometric contracting area (R 2) model cannot be neglected. Model-fitting results for the desolvation of DDS•DXN and DDS•THF concluded that they respectively followed the A 2 and R 2 -model; the micrographs confirmed these model-fitting results. The order of thermal stability between the solvates is as follows: DDS• 0. 5 (DCM) >> DDS•THF > DDS•DXN. The calculated Ea values followed the opposite trend but unfortunately accurate assumptions about Ea may not be reliable since these three solvates are not isostructural. After desolvation of the solvates they completely converted back to the crystal structure of DDS form III at room temperature. A full polymorphic study was done. This knowledge is absolutely important for manufacturing, storage and use of DDS. Doctora...|$|R

Tensile strength of MCC tablets and compactibility parameters calculated by Leuenberger equation after roller compaction was significantly decreased, while THAP, THAFP and THMO tablets showed only a minor reduction in compactibility and compressibility. Adding MCC to a mixture with Theophylline showed that the right choice and ratio of excipients can enable a sufficient mechanical strength of the tablets after roller compaction...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{properties}} {{pertinent to}} the solid phase of the monohydrate and <b>anhydrate</b> forms of cyclophosphamide were determined. Cyclophosphamide monohydrate had a transition temperature of 47. 9 (DEGREES) C and a (DELTA) H(,fusion) of 6. 30 kcal/mol. The <b>anhydrate</b> form, which was different crystallographically from the monohydrate form, had a transition temperature of 51. 9 (DEGREES) C and a (DELTA) H(,fusion) of 5. 39 kcal/mol. ^ The dissociation pressure obtained from the dehydration isotherms at 21 (DEGREES) C, 25 (DEGREES) C, 30 (DEGREES) C and 35 (DEGREES) C gave a calculated (DELTA) H(,dissociation) of 13. 0 kcal/mol. The (DELTA) H(,association) was calculated as - 12. 0 kcal/mol. The hysteresis effect suggested that the mechanisms of dehydration and rehydration were different. ^ Analysis of DSC thermograms of samples from the dehydration process of cyclophosphamide monohydrate indicated that a simple eutectic mixture (melting point 41 (DEGREES) C) was present. The solid-liquid phase diagram showed a eutectic point at 0. 34 mole fraction of the monohydrate. The solid-liquid phase diagram constructed from the analysis of samples from the rehydration process of cyclophosphamide <b>anhydrate</b> showed similar results. ^ At a 21 (DEGREES) C and 0 % relative humidity, the kinetics of the dehydration of cyclophosphamide monohydrate followed Fickian diffusion. At 25 (DEGREES) C and above, the mechanism of dehydration changed because the temperature was approaching the melting point of the eutectic mixture. An increasing amount of atomic movement within the crystalline lattice at higher temperatures caused a greater escaping tendency of the water of crystallization. ^ Two mechanisms of rehydration for cyclophosphamide <b>anhydrate</b> were proposed. The first mechanism of rehydration involved the condensation of water {{onto the surface of}} the solid at higher humidity environments. Dissolution of the solid into the liquid was followed by the recrystallization of the monohydrate from solution. The second mechanism occurred in the absence of condensed water. Interaction of water molecules with cyclophosphamide molecules {{on the surface of the}} solid resulted in the conversion of crystalline form of <b>anhydrate</b> to the monohydrate. The lag time in the rehydration kinetics indicated that rehydration may have been initiated through a nucleation process. The extent of water penetration into the <b>anhydrate</b> solid was controlled by the rate of crystalline conversion to the monohydrate form from the <b>anhydrate.</b> ...|$|E

This paper presents the crystal {{structure of the}} <b>anhydrate,</b> which was obtained by dehydrating the hemi-hydrate. The crystal structure of aspartame <b>anhydrate,</b> L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester, was determined from X-ray powder diffraction data. Aspartame <b>anhydrate</b> crystallizes in the monoclinic system with space group P 2 (1) and cell parameters: a = 19. 4078 (10) angstrom, b = 4. 9605 (2) angstrom, c = 15. 6547 (9) angstrom, beta = 94. 876 (2), V = 1501. 65 (14) angstrom(3).

40|$|The <b>anhydrate</b> and the {{stoichiometric}} tetartohydrate of pyrogallol (0. 25 mol {{water per}} mol pyrogallol) are both storage stable at ambient conditions, provided {{that they are}} phase pure, with the system being at equilibrium at a(w) (water activity) = 0. 15 at 25 degrees C. Structures have been derived from single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction data for the <b>anhydrate</b> and hydrate, respectively. It is notable that the tetarto-hydrate forms a tetragonal structure with water in channels, a framework that although stabilized by water, is found as a higher energy structure on a computationally generated crystal energy landscape, which has the <b>anhydrate</b> crystal structure as the most stable form. Thus, a combination of slurry experiments, X-ray diffraction, spectroscopy, moisture (de) sorption, and thermo-analytical methods with the computationally generated crystal energy landscape and lattice energy calculations provides a consistent picture of the finely balanced hydration behavior of pyrogallol. In addition, two monotropically related dimethyl sulfoxide monosolvates {{were found in the}} accompanying solid form screen...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{pharmaceutical}} dissolution tests {{determine the}} amount of drug dissolved over time by measuring drug content in the dissolution medium. This method provides little direct information about what is happening {{on the surface of the}} dissolving tablet. As the tablet surface composition and structure can change during dissolution, it is essential to monitor it during dissolution testing. In this work coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy is used to image the surface of tablets during dissolution while UV absorption spectroscopy is simultaneously providing inline analysis of dissolved drug concentration for tablets containing a 50 % mixture of theophylline <b>anhydrate</b> and ethyl cellulose. The measurements showed that in situ CARS microscopy is capable of imaging selectively theophylline in the presence of ethyl cellulose. Additionally, the theophylline <b>anhydrate</b> converted to theophylline monohydrate during dissolution, with needle-shaped crystals growing on the tablet surface during dissolution. The conversion of theophylline <b>anhydrate</b> to monohydrate, combined with reduced exposure of the drug to the flowing dissolution medium resulted in decreased dissolution rates. Our results show that in situ CARS microscopy combined with inline U...|$|E

40|$|Transformation of the {{solid-state}} {{form of a}} drug {{compound in}} the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract may alter the drug bioavailability and in extreme cases result in patient fatalities. The solution-mediated anhydrate-to-hydrate phase transformation was examined using an in vitro model with different biorelevant media, simulated fasted and fed state intestinal fluids containing bile salt and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) micelles, DOPC/sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) mixture, bile salt solution and water. Two <b>anhydrate</b> compounds (carbamazepine, CBZ and nitrofurantoin, NF) with different overall transformation time into hydrate form were used as model compounds. The transformations were monitored using direct structural information from time-resolved synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The kinetics of these transformations were estimated using multivariate data analysis (principal component analysis, PCA) and compared to those for nitrofurantoin (NF). The study showed that the solution-mediated phase transformation of CBZ <b>anhydrate</b> was remarkably faster in the DOPC/SDS medium compared to transformation in all the other aqueous dispersion media. The conversion time for CBZ <b>anhydrate</b> in water was shorter than for DOPC/SDS but still faster than the conversion seen in fed and fasted state micellar media. The conversion of CBZ <b>anhydrate</b> to hydrate was the slowest in the solution containing bile salt alone. In contrast, the solution-mediated phase transformations of NF did only show limited kinetic dependence on the dispersion media used, indicating {{the complexity of the}} nucleation process. Furthermore, when the CBZ and NF material was compacted into tablets the transformation times were remarkably slower. Results suggest that variations in the composition of the contents of the stomach/gut may affect the recrystallization kinetics, especially when investigating compounds with relatively fast overall transformation time, such as CBZ...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was a phenomenological study of the effect of environmental factors on the dehydration behavior of carbamazepine dihydrate. Dehydration experiments were performed in an automated vapor sorption apparatus under a variety of conditions, and weight loss was monitored as a function of time. In addition to lattice water, carbamazepine dihydrate contained a significant amount of physically bound water. Based on the kinetics of water loss, it was possible to differentiate between the removal of physically bound water and the lattice water. The activation energy for the 2 processes was 44 and 88 kJ/mol, respectively. As expected, the dehydration rate of carbamazepine dihydrate decreased with an increase in water vapor pressure. While dehydration at 0 % relative humidity (RH) resulted in an amorphous <b>anhydrate,</b> the crystallinity of the <b>anhydrate</b> increased {{as a function of the}} RH of dehydration. A method was developed for in situ crystallinity determination of the <b>anhydrate</b> formed. Dehydration in the presence of the ethanol vapor was a 2 -step process, and the fraction dehydrated at each step was a function of the ethanol vapor pressure. We hypothesize the formation of an intermediate lower hydrate phase with unknown water stoichiometry. An increase in the ethanol vapor pressure first led to a decrease in the dehydration rate followed by an increase. In summary, the dehydration behavior of carbamazepine dihydrate was evaluated at different vapor pressures of water and ethanol. Using the water sorption apparatus, it was possible to (1) differentiate between the removal of physically bound and lattice water, and (2) develop a method for quantifying, in situ, the crystallinity of the product (<b>anhydrate)</b> phase...|$|E

This unprecedented number of monohydrate polymorphs and diversity of solid forms is consistent with the <b>anhydrate</b> and monohydrate crystal energy landscapes, showing both a wide range of packing motifs and also some structures differing only in proton positions. By aiding the solution of structures from powder X-ray diffraction data and guiding the screening, the computational studies help explain the complex polymorphism of gallic acid.

A range of wavelengths is required to characterize the conversion. Multivariate data analysis techniques such as Principal Components Analysis, (PCA), compress high-dimensional, correlated variables to lower dimension while retaining the important information. Additionally, Partial Least Squares (PLS) modeling on the time course data for each batch and PCA, on batch level scores, are used to visualize differences as the material converts from monohydrate to <b>anhydrate</b> over time and across batches. The advantage of these techniques is in being able to capture the complexity of the chemical changes through multiple wavelengths while still reducing the monitoring task to a few simple graphs...|$|E
