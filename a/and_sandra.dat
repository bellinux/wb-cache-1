5|$|Rick {{was one of}} {{only eight}} known hurricanes to form in the East Pacific in November.

Rick was the second one of these to make landfall, {{although}} it was the third weakest of them, just slightly stronger than Nina and Iwa (Tara's central pressure is unknown). Rick is also the second-latest hurricane in official records to have hit either coast of Mexico, behind only Tara.|$|E
5|$|She {{made her}} last film at MGM {{starring}} with Bob Hope in Bachelor in Paradise (1961), which received mostly positive critical reception. Turner's projects of this era include By Love Possessed (1961), {{based on the}} James Gould Cozzens novel. On July 19, 1961, it became the first in-flight movie to be shown {{on a regular basis}} on a scheduled airline flight, by Trans World Airlines (TWA) to its first-class passengers. Other highlights of this period include two Hunter productions (for whom she did Imitation of Life), Portrait in Black (1960), a box office success, co-starring Anthony Quinn <b>and</b> <b>Sandra</b> Dee, and Madame X (1966), which proved to be her last major starring role.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 {{study by}} Kathryn Thomas <b>and</b> <b>Sandra</b> Carlson used teeth {{from the upper}} jaw of three {{individuals}} interpreted as a juvenile, a subadult, and an adult, recovered from a bone bed in the Hell Creek Formation of Corson County, South Dakota. In this study, successive teeth in columns in the edmontosaurs' dental batteries were sampled from multiple locations along each tooth using a microdrilling system. This sampling method {{takes advantage of the}} organization of hadrosaurid dental batteries to find variation in tooth isotopes over a period of time. From their work, it appears that edmontosaur teeth took less than about 0.65years to form, slightly faster in younger edmontosaurs. The teeth of all three individuals appeared to show variation in oxygen isotope ratios that could correspond to warm/dry and cool/wet periods; Thomas and Carlson considered the possibility that the animals were migrating instead, but favored local seasonal variations because migration would have more likely led to ratio homogenization, as many animals migrate to stay within specific temperature ranges or near particular food sources.|$|E

5|$|Chloe Mitchell is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American CBS soap opera, The Young and the Restless. Introduced by former executive producer Edward J. Scott as {{the daughter of}} trusty Chancellor family maid, Esther Valentine (Kate Linder), the character was born onscreen on July 30, 1990. Originally portrayed by twins, Darla <b>and</b> <b>Sandra</b> Greer, until 1991, upon her brief return in 1994, child actress, Danielle Ryah, portrayed the role. On February 6, 2008, executive producer/head writer Josh Griffith introduced a new character, Chloe Mitchell, played by former All My Children actress, Elizabeth Hendrickson. That August, a change in storyline revealed Chloe was Kate, having legally changed her name while offscreen, when the character was away in boarding school. Upgraded from recurring to contract status, Hendrickson became {{an integral part of the}} cast.|$|E
5|$|Kafka {{was born}} on July 25, 1987, in Chicago, Illinois, to Michael <b>and</b> <b>Sandra</b> Kafka. He {{attended}} St. Rita of Cascia High School in Chicago, where he played football (coached by Todd Kuska) and baseball. He was the team captain for both teams. In football, he led the Mustangs to three conference championships and had a career record of 35–8. As a senior in 2004, Kafka completed 75-of-129 passes. In the season-opener against Homewood-Flossmoor High School, Kafka went up against H-F's quarterback Freddie Barnes and won the game, 52–28. Against Mt. Carmel High School, he ran for 164yards and passed for 126yards. Kafka passed for 1,004yards and 10 touchdowns in 2004.

5|$|Steadily {{increasing}} {{wind shear}} gradually unraveled Sandra {{during the latter}} part of November26 and into November27. The storm's outflow, though prominent to the north, became restricted on the southern side. Sandra briefly regained organization around 00:00UTC on November27, with its eye becoming redefined; however, persistent shear prevailed and the system weakened below major hurricane status by 06:00UTC. The hurricane rapidly deteriorated throughout November27 as convection became displaced to the northeast of the circulation. The low-level circulation soon decoupled from the mid- to upper-level circulations <b>and</b> <b>Sandra</b> degraded to a tropical storm by 00:00UTC on November28. The convectively devoid low-level circulation abruptly turned northwest in response to a shallow ridge. Failing to redevelop convection atop its center, Sandra degenerated into a remnant low by 06:00UTC. Sustained winds dropped below gale-force by 18:00UTC. Intense thunderstorm activity did blossom to the northeast of the center late on November28, prompting the storm to resume a northeasterly course. Sandra's remnants eventually succumbed to strong shear and opened up into a trough, roughly 60mi (95km) southwest of Culiacán, Mexico, late on November29.|$|E

5|$|TSN {{offered to}} {{broadcast}} her funeral live {{and to make}} the signal available to any other stations at no charge. Her husband, Shannon England, agreed to the broadcast on the condition that the family would not be shown during the service. CBC also broadcast the service, marking the first time a Canadian athlete's funeral had been televised live on two networks. The Brier was just getting underway and games in the afternoon draw were delayed to allow curlers and fans to watch the funeral, which was broadcast on screens at the rink. Regina's Agridome and Schmirler's home Caledonian Curling Club also opened to show the funeral. Nine hundred people attended the service at the Regina Funeral Home, thousands watched at satellite locations around the province, and hundreds of thousands watched on television. The funeral was conducted by the Rev. Don Wells, <b>and</b> <b>Sandra</b> was eulogized by Brian McCusker, teammate Joan McCusker's husband.|$|E
5|$|The books also aroused controversies in the {{literary}} and publishing worlds. From 1997 to 1998, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone won almost all the UK awards judged by children, {{but none of the}} children's book awards judged by adults, <b>and</b> <b>Sandra</b> Beckett suggested the reason was intellectual snobbery towards books that were popular among children. In 1999, the winner of the Whitbread Book of the Year award children's division was entered {{for the first time on}} the shortlist for the main award, and one judge threatened to resign if Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was declared the overall winner; it finished second, very close behind the winner of the poetry prize, Seamus Heaney's translation of the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf.|$|E
5|$|The {{forensic}} {{examination of}} the lead pipes found {{at the murder scene}} and in the Corsair's boot revealed traces of blood on the pipe from 46Lower Belgrave Street. This proved to be a mixture of Lady Lucan's (blood group A) <b>and</b> <b>Sandra</b> Rivett's (B) blood. Hair belonging to Veronica Lucan was also found on that pipe, but none belonging to Sandra Rivett. The pipe found inside the car had neither blood nor hair on it. Home Office scientists were unable to prove conclusively that both pipes were cut from the same, longer, piece of piping, although they thought it likely. The tape wrapped around both was similar, but those too could not be conclusively linked. The letters written to Bill Shand-Kydd were stained with blood considered to be from both women. The letter to Michael Stoop had no blood on it, but it was later proven that the paper it was written on had been torn from a writing pad found in the Corsair's boot.|$|E
