Owing to the rapid increase of the reaction O(+) + N 2 yields NO(+) + N with ion velocity and temperature, high latitude electric fields and consequent E x B drifts act to deplete O(+) in favor of NO(+). As a consequence of this and the reduced rate of NO(+) dissociative recombination arising from high electron temperatures, it seems that NO(+) can, at times, replace O(+) as the major F 2 -region ion {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>auroral</b> <b>ovals.</b> The same processes should also be effective in creating nighttime electron density troughs composed primarily of NO(+) in regions equatorward of the <b>auroral</b> <b>ovals</b> where large electric fields are often present...|$|R
40|$|The various {{processes}} which generate {{magnetic fields}} within the Jupiter system are exemplary {{for a large}} class of similar processes occurring at other planets in the solar system, but also around extrasolar planets. Jupiter's large internal dynamo magnetic field generates a gigantic magnetosphere, which is strongly rotational driven and possesses large plasma sources located deeply within the magnetosphere. The combination of the latter two effects is {{the primary reason for}} Jupiter's main <b>auroral</b> <b>ovals.</b> Jupiter's moon Ganymede is the only known moon with an intrinsic dynamo magnetic field, which generates a mini-magnetosphere located within Jupiter's larger magnetosphere including two <b>auroral</b> <b>ovals.</b> Ganymede's magnetosphere is qualitatively different compared to the one from Jupiter. It possesses no bow shock but develops Alfvén wings similar to most of the extrasolar planets which orbit their host stars within 0. 1 AU. New numerical models of Jupiter's and Ganymede's magnetospheres presented here provide quantitative insight into the processes that maintain these magnetospheres. Jupiter's magnetospheric field is approximately time-periodic at the locations of Jupiter's moons and induces secondary magnetic fields in electrically conductive layers such as subsurface oceans. In the case of Ganymede, these secondary magnetic fields influence the oscillation of the location of its <b>auroral</b> <b>ovals.</b> Based on dedicated Hubble Space Telescope observations, an analysis of the amplitudes of the auroral oscillations provides evidence that Ganymede harbors a subsurface ocean. Callisto in contrast does not possess a mini-magnetosphere, but still shows a perturbed magnetic field environment.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to search for a subsurface ocean within Ganymede through observations and modeling of the dynamics of its <b>auroral</b> <b>ovals.</b> The locations of the <b>auroral</b> <b>ovals</b> oscillate due to Jupiter's time-varying magnetospheric field seen in the rest frame of Ganymede. If an electrically conductive ocean is present, the external time-varying magnetic field is reduced due to induction within the ocean and the oscillation amplitude of the ovals decreases. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations show that the locations of the ovals oscillate on average by 2. 0 ± 1. 3. Our model calculations predict a significantly stronger oscillation by 5. 8 ± 1. 3 without ocean compared to 2. 2 ± 1. 3 if an ocean is present. Because the ocean and the no-ocean hypotheses cannot be separated by simple visual inspection of individual HST images, we apply a statistical analysis including a Monte Carlo test to also address the uncertainty caused by the patchiness of observed emissions. The observations require a minimum electrical conductivity of 0. 09 S/m for an ocean assumed to be located between 150 km and 250 km depth or alternatively a maximum depth of the top of the ocean at 330 km. Our analysis implies that Ganymede's dynamo possesses an outstandingly low quadrupole-to-dipole moment ratio.

5000|$|The term 'auroral electrojet' is {{the name}} given to the large {{horizontal}} currents that flow in the D and E regions of the auroral ionosphere. Although horizontal ionospheric currents {{can be expected to}} flow at any latitude where horizontal ionospheric electric fields are present, the auroral electrojet currents are remarkable for their strength and persistence. There are two main factors in the production of the electrojet. First of all, the conductivity of the auroral ionosphere is generally larger than that at lower latitudes. Secondly, the horizontal electric field in the auroral ionosphere is also larger than that at lower latitudes. Since the strength of the current is directly proportional to the vector product of the conductivity and the horizontal electric field, the auroral electrojet currents are generally larger compared to those at lower latitudes. During magnetically quiet periods, the electrojet is generally confined to the <b>auroral</b> <b>oval.</b> However during disturbed periods, the electrojet increases in strength and expands to both higher and lower latitudes. This expansion results from two factors, enhanced particle precipitation and enhanced ionospheric electric fields.|$|E

In a more sophisticated model, the <b>auroral</b> <b>oval</b> between about 15° and 20°colatitude (again simulated by a coaxial auroral zone), as a transition zone between the field reversal, has been taken into account. The ionospheric dynamo region between about 100 to 200 km altitude is a region where ions and electrons have different mobility. Thus the plasma becomes electrically conducting. Due to the geomagnetic field, two kinds of electric currents exist: Pedersen currents parallel to E, and Hall currents orthogonal to E and B. Moreover, a significant enhancement of the electric conductivity within the aurora area depending on geomagnetic activity exists which influences the parameter τco [...] in eq. (...) [...] The electric convection field drives strong electric currents within the polar dynamo regions (e.g. DP1 and DP2) which can be simulated by the model. Manifestations of upper atmospheric electric currents are the corresponding magnetic variations on the ground. Unfortunately, this connection is unique only for horizontally flowing current systems. E.g., the vertically flowing field-aligned currents have almost no magnetic effect on the ground. The model allows to separate the contributions of both kinds of electric currents. The polar magnetic disturbances DP2 are mainly Hall currents. The auroral electrojets (DP1) with magnitudes of the order of several hundreds of kA flowing within the aurora zones consist of Hall currents and Pedersen currents. Dissipation of the Pedersen currents produces Joule heating which is transferred to the neutral gas of the thermosphere thus generating thermospheric and ionospheric disturbances. Longer-lasting magnetospheric disturbances of the order of several hours to days can develop into global-scale thermospheric and ionospheric storms (e.g.,).|$|E
