Further batteries and fortifications were constructed around Rosia Bay near {{the south of}} the peninsula and Windmill Hill was strengthened around its entire perimeter, with Retrenched Barracks at its north end blocking access to the higher ground behind. The sea wall in the town was straightened and strengthened with the building of two new curtain walls, Prince Albert's Front and Wellington Front. Defensive breakwaters were constructed in front of both to prevent an armoured enemy ship ramming the walls.|$|E

25|$|The Bolshevik {{policy of}} terror was more systematic, better organized, and {{targeted}} at whole social classes. Moreover, {{it had been}} thought out <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>practice</b> before {{the outbreak of the}} civil war. The White Terror was never systematized in such a fashion. It was almost invariably the work of detachments that were out of control, and taking measures not officially authorized by the military command that was attempting, without much success, to act as a government. If one discounts the pogroms, which Denikin himself condemned, the White Terror most often was a series of reprisals by the police acting as a sort of military counterespionage force. The Cheka and the Troops for the Internal Defense of the Republic were a structured and powerful instrument of repression of a completely different order, which had support at the highest level from the Bolshevik regime.|$|E

Codreanu claimed to had a vision of the Archangel Michael who told him he had been chosen by God to be Romania's savior. Right from the start, a commitment to the values of the Eastern Orthodox Church was core to the message of the Legion, and Codreanu's alleged vision was a centerpiece of his message.|$|E
25|$|On 10 January 1864, Alexandra {{gave birth}} to a second son and last child, Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich of Russia. The {{following}} year, Alexandra became chairwoman {{of the board of trustees}} of the office of Empress Maria Alexandrovna which oversaw orphanages, founding homes, schools and hospitals. The area of medicine and nursing had a particular appeal to Alexandra, and sometimes she nursed the patients herself. In 1865, Alexandra founded a training institute for nurses in St Petersburg, the Pokrov of our lady commune. In spite of the differences in character and outlook, Alexandra and her husband lived in harmony for the first ten years of their married life. Initially, Grand Duke Nicholas respected and admired his wife's interest in charities and medicine as well as her being extremely religious. He financed a hospital in the city where her theories could be developed <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>practice</b> and poor patients received care without charge.|$|E

It is inferred that the algal development is not on account of eutrophication or unusual growth of plankton but is on account of accumulation of stable cyst {{on the surface of}} the reservoir caused due to the process of phototaxis at the inlet end of the reservoir and spread to cover the reservoir surface completely. Its annual occurrence was noted since 1990. This process created extensive cultivation of Peridinium bipes of dinoflagellate, which generated a foul smell and discolored the water surface area thus marring the scenic beauty of the reservoir. This necessitated instituting measures to eradicate the problem. Various alternative treatments were examined, such as cyclic aeration, treatment after collection, use of ozone and ultraviolet irradiation; the ultraviolet irradiation method has been chosen <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>practice.</b> For this purpose a river craft was developed and named as [...] "Red tide treatment ship". With the automated process operated from the ship, the red tides are eliminated almost completely using ultraviolet (UV) irradiation.|$|E

And this, sir, I have done with that boldness, for which I will stand accountable to any of our little critics, who, perhaps, are no better acquainted with him than I am. Upon your first perusal of this poem, you have taken notice of some words which I have innovated (if it be too bold for me to say refined) upon his Latin; which, as I offer not to introduce into English prose, so I hope they are neither improper, nor altogether inelegant in verse; and, in this, Horace will again defend me.|$|E
