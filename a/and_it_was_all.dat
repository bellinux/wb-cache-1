25|$|So, {{with the}} score at 75 for 6, England once again needed a big partnership, {{this time from}} Flintoff and wicket-keeper Geraint Jones. The pair saw England to lunch, but Flintoff had {{suffered}} a shoulder injury and looked in obvious pain. In the first over after lunch, Jones gave an edge to Ponting – seven down for 101. Giles batted responsibly, padding up to Warne, but eventually {{felt the need to}} play at one, which Hayden held with relative ease. Harmison came and went, facing one delivery, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> up to Simon Jones and Andrew Flintoff to see England to a challenging target.|$|E
25|$|I {{remember}} somebody {{yelling and}} seeing a big {{ball of fire}} {{near the top of}} the tent. And this ball of fire just got bigger and bigger and bigger. By that time, everybody was panicking. The exit was blocked with the cages that the animals were brought in and out with. And there was a man taking kids and flinging them up and over that cage to get them out. I was sitting up in the bleachers and jumped down — I was three-quarters of the way up. You jump down <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> straw underneath. There was a young man, a kid, and he had a pocketknife. And he slit the tent, took my arm and pulled me out.|$|E

25|$|The Germans {{attacked}} at dawn <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> over by 14:00. As the Germans {{searched the}} forest the SAS men {{tried to break}} out. A party of 34 were moving down a forest track when they were ambushed and captured. The leader of the party, Lieutenant Tomos Stephens, was beaten to death by a German officer using a rifle butt; seven captured Maquisards were executed in the woods. The SAS men and the US pilot should have been treated as prisoners of war. However, their fate {{was determined by the}} issue of the Commando Order by Adolf Hitler which called for the execution of commandos. The decision of who was going to execute them was the cause of an argument between the German Army and the SS. It was decided that the army would carry out the execution. On 7 July, the surviving prisoners of war, 30 SAS men and Second Lieutenant Bundy, were taken into the woods near to St Sauvant, forced to dig their own graves then executed by a German firing squad at dawn under the command of SS Major Josef Kieffer. Their bodies were then buried in a mass grave. Three Special Air Service men who had been wounded and hospitalized were killed by the administration of lethal injections. The men executed in the woods were re-interred in the village cemetery of Rom, Deux-Sèvres. The bodies of the three men executed in the hospital have never been found, but they are commemorated by a plaque among their comrades' headstones in Rom.|$|E

500|$|Contemporary William Joseph Snelling, in his 1831 {{biography}} of Jackson, strongly criticizes Eaton. Of Eaton's Jackson biography, he wrote, [...] "it {{is hard to}} say which is more disgraced, the hero [...] or the historian. The book contains scarcely a period of good English, but makes amends by abundance of fulsome adulation, by the admission of many disgraceful acts and the palliation of others." [...] By 1831, Snelling says, he had become [...] "the laughing-stock of the nation." [...] Remini says that [...] "the entire Eaton affair might be termed infamous. It ruined reputations and terminated friendships. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> so needless." ...|$|E

In fact, a car had run into {{the front of the}} building, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> boarded up, but we still played there." [...] When one of the guitarists broke a string Araya would hand them the bass, Hanneman stating, [...] "We'd argue about it, too—like, 'I wanna play bass for a while!'" ...|$|E

One such character was Mrs. Kelly, a gossip. Leno would sing a verse of a song, then begin a monologue, often his You know Mrs. Kelly? routine, which became a well-known catchphrase: [...] "You see we had a row once, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> through Mrs. Kelly.

Chaplin eventually cast Clive {{in the role of}} the millionaire. Although the film was originally set in Paris, the art direction is inspired by a mix of several cities. Robert Sherwood said that [...] "it is a weird city, with confusing resemblances to London, Los Angeles, Naples, Paris, Tangiers <b>and</b> Council Bluffs. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> no city on earth <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> cities." ...|$|R

500|$|The Great Dining Room is {{situated}} in the east wing extension {{of the house and}} was added in 1877 under J. MacVicar Anderson {{during the time of the}} Red Earl. The room was inspired by the ballroom of Buckingham Palace, with walls hung with faded, red damask silk. The Spencers ate their regular meals in the Tapestry Dining Room, an inner room of the east side to the east of the Wooton Hall. Aside from the two fine vividly constructed tapestries, one of gypsies and one of farming, the room is fairly bleak in design compared to other rooms in the house; the dining table is relatively small, with a drab grey floor and open brick fireplace dated in large letters to 1683. The [...] "sombre" [...] oak panelling originally came from the family's other property of Wormleighton Manor in Warwickshire. [...] Charles Spencer recalled that three generations of Spencers would eat their lunch together and that dining conditions were [...] "silent, apart from the noises of my grandfather eating with great gusto, a napkin tucked in around his neck, hanging down over his popping-out tummy, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> very sad and tense".|$|E
500|$|It {{was decided}} {{the effects of}} kryptonite {{poisoning}} on Clark, [...] "Clark time", {{and the appearance of}} kryptonite when in the proximity of Clark would need to be illustrated in a way the audience could understand if they were not familiar with the character. Gough and Millar, after doing some research, learned the female audience was not aware of what was happening when Clark was exposed to kryptonite. Beginning with [...] "Metamorphosis", whenever Clark was exposed to kryptonite, his veins would rise up and develop a green hue to illustrate the effect it was having. Close-up shots of Clark's hand were used for these scenes, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> created with digital animation. Gough and Millar developed the idea that kryptonite would only glow when it was around Clark, as it was meant to demonstrate the draining of his powers. [...] "Clark time", the same idea behind bullet time, was created because previous incarnations had not explained the idea of what the world appears like to Clark when he is using his powers. The first instance of [...] "Clark time" [...] was used in the [...] "Metamorphosis" [...] scene where Greg Arkin attacks Clark and Jonathan in their barn. Jonathan is pushed over a banister and falls in the direction of some dangerous farm equipment. The effect involved slowing time down for everything except Clark, who would be moving at normal pace. When tackling Clark's emerging power of X-ray vision, Gough and Millar {{wanted to be able to}} see skeletons and bones, as opposed to previous incarnations that treated the ability like [...] "see-through" [...] vision. The recent advances in computer imagery helped them complete that task.|$|E

Savall's early work criticized the world-wide dissemination of flawed management analysis and decision-making models that were shaped by a particular mindset.
