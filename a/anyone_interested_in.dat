25|$|In 2003, the bicentenary of Berlioz's birth, his {{achievements}} and status {{were much more}} widely recognized, and his music is now viewed as both serious and original, rather than an eccentric novelty. Newspaper articles reported his colourful life with zeal, very many festivals dedicated to the composer were held, readings of his books and a one-hour French television dramatised biography all helped to {{create a lot of}} exposure to the composer's life and music– far more than the previous centenary anniversary. Numerous recording projects were begun or reissued, and broadcasts of his music increased. Prominent Berlioz conductor Colin Davis had already been in the process of recording much of Berlioz's music on the LSO Live label, and has continued this project to this date with a L'enfance du Christ recording issued in 2007. The internet was also a factor in the celebrations, with the comprehensive hberlioz.com site (which has been online since 1997) being an easily available source of information to <b>anyone</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the composer. The 'Berlioz 2003' celebrations, organised by French academic institutions, also had a prominent website, listing events, publications and gatherings the domain of which has now lapsed. There was also a site maintained by the Association nationale Hector Berlioz. A proposal was made to remove his remains to the Panthéon, and while initially encouraged by French President Jacques Chirac, the proposal was rejected on the basis that Berlioz was an anti-establishment figure and would have no interest in such a ceremony, and that he was happy to be buried next to his two wives in the location he has been in for almost 150 years.|$|E

500|$|Intimacy {{was made}} {{available}} for download on Bloc Party's website on 21 August 2008. Ten MP3 tracks were sold with a plain black JPEG cover for £5, and a £10 option for the online songs and the future expanded CD was also available. The album title was picked as a [...] "double bluff" [...] with regard to people's expectations; Okereke has explained, [...] "You'd think of wet balladeering. You don't think it's gonna be ugly or harsh. But that's what relationships are really like. It's not just about good times." [...] The release was called [...] "rushed" [...] by publications such as Billboard and The Independent.

Teaming with 2 Cold Scorpio, he held the title belts for three weeks. He later won the title twice more while teaming with The Patriot, {{a team that was}} dubbed Stars and Stripes due to the patriotic theme both wrestlers were using at the time. After being left behind by both partners, he expressed a desire to form a new tag team to challenge for the title again. According to WCW's storylines, his former partners believed that he was too demanding, and he was unable to find <b>anyone</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> teaming with him due to his reputation as being [...] "difficult to work with".|$|E

500|$|Armstrong was {{the first}} to {{describe}} the vowel system of Somali. A 2014 bibliography on the Somali language called Armstrong's paper [...] "seminal" [...] and notes she provides a more detailed description of Somali vowels than other works. She was also the first to discuss vowel harmony in Somali; her vowel harmony analysis was praised by Italian Somalist [...] Australian British linguist Roy Clive Abraham wrote that he agreed with Armstrong on most parts regarding Somali phonetics: [...] "there are very few points where I disagree with her". Austro-Hungarian linguist Werner Vycichl wrote that Armstrong's study [...] "opens a new chapter of African studies". In 1992, Trinity College, Dublin linguist John Ibrahim Saeed said Armstrong's paper was [...] "even now the outstanding study of Somali phonetics", and in 1996, Martin Orwin wrote that it [...] "remains essential reading for <b>anyone</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> pursuing any aspect of the sound system of Somali".|$|E
500|$|A few {{reference}} grammars address sentence spacing, {{as increased}} spacing between words is punctuation in itself. Most do not. [...] Grammar guides typically cover terminal punctuation {{and the proper}} construction of sentences—but not the spacing between sentences. Moreover, many modern grammar guides are designed for quick reference and refer users to comprehensive style guides for additional matters of writing style. For example, the Pocket Idiot's Guide to Grammar and Punctuation (2005) points users to style guides such as the MLA Style Manual for consistency in formatting work and for all other [...] "editorial concerns". The Grammar Bible (2004) states that [...] "The modern system of English punctuation {{is by no means}} simple. [...] A book that covers all the bases would need to be of considerable breadth and weight and <b>anyone</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> such a resource is advised to consult the Chicago Manual of Style." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1536, Calvin {{published}} {{the first edition}} of his Institutio Christianae Religionis or Institutes of the Christian Religion. The work was an apologia or defense of his faith and a statement of the doctrinal position of the reformers. [...] He also intended it to serve as an elementary instruction book for <b>anyone</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the Christian faith. [...] The book was the first expression of his theology. Calvin updated the work and published new editions throughout his life. [...] Shortly after its publication, he left Basel for Ferrara, Italy, where he briefly served as secretary to Princess Renée of France. [...] By June he was back in Paris with his brother Antoine, who was resolving their father's affairs. Following the Edict of Coucy, which gave a limited six-month period for heretics to reconcile with the Catholic faith, Calvin decided that there was no future for him in France. In August he set off for Strasbourg, a free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire and a refuge for reformers. [...] Due to military manoeuvres of imperial and French forces, he was forced to make a detour to the south, bringing him to Geneva.|$|E

500|$|Tim Byrd {{reviewed}} the adventure in The Space Gamer No. 30, stating that it [...] "successfully combines fantasy with SF" [...] {{and that it}} was [...] "extremely fun to play [...] one of the best modules TSR has published". Two gaming magazines reviewed Expedition to the Barrier Peaks in 1981. Reviewer Marcus L. Rowland said in White Dwarf #26 that he found the adventure [...] "very enjoyable, with ideas and creatures eminently suitable for wider use". He gave it 9/10 overall, but complained that some of the maps were printed {{on both sides of the}} same sheet, making them useless as a Dungeon Master's shield (a visual barrier that allows dice rolls and other activities to be conducted without the players knowing the outcome). He recommended at least a week's study by the Dungeon Master before attempting to play it. He also notes that the cover [...] "reveals the secret of the creatures". Kirby Griffis {{reviewed the}} adventure in The Space Gamer #36. Griffis noted that it is full of [...] "surprises and new monsters", and felt that its one drawback was that Gygax presented standard D monsters as natives of other planets. In summary, he found it interesting and [...] "full of spice and flavor"; recommending it to <b>anyone</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> [...] "something new" [...] or wanting to include science fiction in their D game.|$|E
500|$|The early {{ports of}} the game also {{received}} high reviews, though their sales {{have been described as}} [...] "dismal". The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly called the Super NES version a good conversion that retained the good music, huge levels, and overall fun of the original game and dismissed the censoring in the version as inconsequential. The magazine rated the Jaguar version similarly, commenting that the graphics and audio were superior to other versions {{of the game}}, but criticizing the faster movement of the player character as making it less fun to play. A GamePro review of the Jaguar port was highly complimentary, saying Wolfenstein 3D [...] "set a new standard for PC gaming" [...] and that the Jaguar version was the best to date, and better than the original due to its increased graphics and sound capabilities. Major Mike of GamePro commended the 3DO version's complete absence of pixelation, fast scaling, [...] "rousing" [...] music, and high quality sound effects, but criticized the controls as overly sensitive. He concluded that the game, then over three years old, [...] "still packs a punch as a first-person shooter". Wolfenstein 3D won GamePros Best 3DO Game of 1995 award, beating the acclaimed The Need for Speed and D. Maximum, on the other hand, while stating that the 3DO port was better than the original and as good as the Jaguar version, felt that it was so aged compared to recent releases like [...] and the PlayStation version of Doom that a new port was pointless, with the game now [...] "somewhat tiresome and very, very repetitive". A reviewer for Next Generation asserted that Wolfenstein 3D was [...] "still as addictive as it ever was" [...] but essentially agreed with Maximum, contending that <b>anyone</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> first-person shooters would have either already played it on another platform or [...] "moved on" [...] to more advanced games in the genre. A more modern review by Daemon Hatfield of IGN gave the PlayStation Network release of the game a warm reception, saying that while it was [...] "dated and flawed", it was [...] "required playing for any first-person shooter fan".|$|E
