Unscrupulous credit providers often insert dubious jurisdiction clauses in credit agreements and end up instituting legal proceedings in courts miles away from where consumers work or reside. In practice, debt collection practitioners use section 45 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act to obtain consent to the issuing <b>of</b> <b>emoluments</b> attachment orders from courts which would not have jurisdiction in terms of section 65 J(1) (a) of the Magistrates’ Courts Act. This minor dissertation investigates the inevitable impact of the National Credit Act on civil procedures used by credit providers to collect outstanding debts sounding in money; the interpretation of section 45 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act with regard to its application in practices relating to the issuing <b>of</b> <b>emoluments</b> attachment orders by consent; and the rationale in considering a court’s jurisdiction in the issuing <b>of</b> <b>emoluments</b> attachment orders where the underlying agreement is a credit agreement to which the National Credit Act applies.
