25|$|In {{response}} to the EU Directive 2002/73/EC, Greece enacted Law 3488/2006 (O.G.A.'.191). The law specifies that sexual harassment {{is a form of}} gender-based discrimination in the workplace. Victims also have the right to compensation. Prior to this law, the policy on sexual harassment in Greece was very weak. Sexual harassment was not defined by any law, and victims could only use general laws, which were very poor in <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
25|$|Historically, in the 1850s Jefferson's eldest grandson, Thomas Jefferson Randolph, told {{historian}} Henry Randall {{that the}} late Peter Carr, a married nephew of Jefferson's (the son of his sister), had fathered Hemings' children; Randolph asked Randall {{to refrain from}} <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> in his biography. Randall passed on this information to James Parton, another historian. Parton published the Carr story, and major historians of Jefferson generally asserted the denial of Jefferson's paternity for nearly 150 years.|$|E
25|$|The biggest {{criticism}} of the traditional zonal system based 5 member selection committee {{is that of the}} interest served by the committee members.

BCCI tried <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> as part of its Shashank Manohar led constitution review committee in 2006.

25|$|Briggs' {{love for}} {{baseball}} triggered {{another piece of}} research. During World War II the government had mandated that rubber in baseballs be replaced by cork. Complaints about the new balls lead Briggs to test them, and in 1945 he demonstrated that the new baseballs were inferior. This was done by <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> {{of whether or not}} a pitched baseball could curve out of the plane of the pitch. With the help of two pitchers from the Washington Senators baseball club and his 1917 wind tunnel he studied the effect of spin and speed on the trajectory and established the relationship between the amount of spin and the curvature of the ball (see curveball). To measure the spin, he attached a lightweight tape to the ball and counted the number of twists in the tape. This was a popular topic in newspapers and is probably the most widely known of his research.|$|E
25|$|In March 2016, Ryan Green, {{speaking}} for his team, {{commented that the}} game has only sold about 14,000 copies, based on Steam Spy data, and {{they have yet to}} recover their development funds for the game. Ryan noted that many Let's Play videos, gathering more than a million views, of That Dragon, Cancer had simply played through the game without commenting on it or providing viewers with links and information about the game, giving viewers no incentive to purchase the title once they had seen it in its entirety. Numinous Games used YouTube's ContentID system to flag and take down some of these videos, leading some players to complain and which Ryan admitted was not the best approach towards <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> Ryan felt that they would be satisfied if these viewers had left small tips on Numinous Games' website in lieu of purchasing the game, so that Numinous could continue to develop more titles.|$|E

25|$|Orpwood {{develops}} his {{mechanism by}} first <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of information. One unsolved aspect of qualia {{is the concept}} of the fundamental information involved in creating the experience. He does not address a position on the metaphysics of the information underlying the experience of qualia, nor does he state what information actually is. However, Orpwood does suggest that information in general is of two types: the information structure and information message. Information structures are defined by the physical vehicles and structural, biological patterns encoding information. That encoded information is the information message; a source describing what that information is. The neural mechanism or network receives input information structures, completes a designated instructional task (firing of the neuron or network), and outputs a modified information structure to downstream regions. The information message is the purpose and meaning of the information structure and causally exists {{as a result of that}} particular information structure. Modification of the information structure changes the meaning of the information message, but the message itself cannot be directly altered.|$|E
25|$|Balasubramanian {{started his}} {{research}} activities in 1965 {{focusing on the}} structure and functions of proteins and polypeptides and worked on the thermodynamic analysis of their stability. The focus of his research changed in 1984/85 {{when he started to}} work on ocular science and concentrated on crystallins of eye lens and their function as an agent in keeping the lens transparent. His research revealed how cataract is caused when crystallins are damaged photochemically, thereby leading to diminished lenticular transparency. He argued that the oxidative stress on the lens induces covalent chemical changes in the constituent molecules and these changes lead to cataract. He researched further on the subject to find out that, by supplementing antioxidants and cytoprotective substances, the progression of cataract can be slowed down. These findings are known to have introduced a prophylactic approach to <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of cataract, which is reported to be the causal factor for 47.9 percent of the blindness in the world. Further, he attempted to identify the cataractostatic agents and proposed the benefits of tea polyphenols, Ginko Biloba and Withania somnifera extracts. These substances contained antioxidants and cytoprotective compounds which slow down the progression of oxidative cataract and this was verified during experiments in animals.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) {{had asked}} on September 17, 2012 the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals {{to place an}} {{emergency}} stay on the permanent injunction made by Judge Forrest on September 12, 2012 The Justice Department wanted the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals to put the judge's ruling on hold while they challenge her decision on appeal. This request by the DOJ was granted on September 17, 2012 when a single federal appeals court judge put a temporary hold on the district court judge's permanent injunction ruling made by judge Katherine Forrest on September 12, 2012. U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit Judge Raymond Lohier issued a one-page order by which he granted the Justice Department's request for an interim stay of the permanent injunction in Hedges, pending the Second Circuit's consideration of the government's motion to stay the injunction throughout its appeal. Judge Lohier's order further said that a Second Circuit motions panel will take up the government's motion for stay pending appeal on September 28, 2012. Lohier offered no explanation or rationale for the interim stay. The Lohier order basically a.) temporarily stayed Judge Forrest's 2012-09-12 ruling b.) puts the whole matter i.e. the permanent injunction on hold c.) allows enforcement of the blocked NDAA section pending appeal and d.) means that the interim stay will remain in effect until at least September 28, 2012 when a three judge panel of the Second Circuit {{is expected to begin}} <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of a longer-term stay(The September 28, 2012 hearing won't go over the merits of the case, but only deal with the U.S. government's motion to stay the permanent injunction throughout its appeal of the permanent injunction.).
