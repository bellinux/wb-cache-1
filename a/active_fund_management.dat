40|$|The {{popularity}} of funds that replicate a market performance continue to surge and several literatures have documented {{the superiority of}} index funds outperforming their <b>active</b> <b>fund</b> <b>management</b> counterparts. Most of these studies {{have been based on}} data from developed, emerging and frontier economies including the USA, Britain, France, Japan, India and many other countries. This study joins the debate by analysing Ghana specific data to measure the performance of Ghanaian fund managers from 2006 to 2013. This is the first of such analysis in the Ghanaian context. Using aggregate average returns, Sharpe ratio and Jensen's Alpha based on the Capital Asset Pricing Module (CAPM) as the key performance indices, the study finds that fund managers in Ghana by aggregation do not provide superior returns using the GSE composite index as the market return benchmark and that fund managers on average have underperformed the market during the period of study. The aggregate of their performance further worsen on a risk adjusted returns after factoring in fund managers cost. This notwithstanding, some fund managers on a risk adjusted average return basis outperformed the market return albeit funds with an asset allocation portfolio of not less than 60 % equity. Although the Ghanaian economy exhibit signs of a frontier market, the research observed fund managers in Ghana do not exhibit market timing skills and stock selection abilities that would have made them outperform the market. Evidence of superior performance persistence is also not noticeable but consistency in underperformance is observed.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a {{dramatic}} shift from mutual funds into hedge funds even though hedge <b>funds</b> charge <b>management</b> fees that have been decried as outrageous. While expectations of superior returns {{may be responsible for}} this shift, this article shows that mutual funds are more expensive than commonly believed. Mutual funds appear to provide investment services for relatively low fees because they bundle passive and <b>active</b> <b>funds</b> <b>management</b> together in a way that understates the true cost of <b>active</b> <b>management.</b> In particular, <b>funds</b> engaging in “closet” or “shadow” indexing charge their investors for active management while providing them with little more than an indexed investment. Even the average mutual fund, which ostensibly provides only active management, will have over 90 % of the variance in its returns explained by its benchmark index. This article derives a method for allocating <b>fund</b> expenses between <b>active</b> and passive management and constructs a simple formula for finding the cost of active management. Computing this “active expense ratio” requires only a fund’s published expense ratio, its R-squared relative to a benchmark index, and the expense ratio for a competitive fund that tracks that index. At the end of 2004, the mean active expense ratio for the large-cap equity mutual funds tracked by Morningstar was 7 %, over six times their published expense ratio of 1. 15 %. More broadly, funds in the Morningstar universe had a mean active expense ratio of 5. 2 %, while the largest funds averaged a percent or two less. mutual fund expenses, cost allocation, active expense ratio, active alpha, portable alpha...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the impact of educational backgrounds of equity mutual <b>fund</b> managers on <b>active</b> <b>management</b> measured by active share, tracking error, and fund duration. The thesis contributes to <b>active</b> mutual <b>fund</b> <b>management</b> literature by studying {{the relation between the}} dimensions of active management and educational characteristics identified {{to have an impact on}} fund performance. Although the thesis does not study the relation between education and performance as such, the results add to the story behind the observed good performance of the most <b>active</b> <b>funds</b> and create new insights regarding the differences between mutual fund managers with educational backgrounds of different quality. The novel hand-collected data set comprises 1, 448 fund-year observations of 354 managers that were solely responsible for managing 321 U. S. equity mutual funds for at least one full year between 2000 and 2015. The evaluation of the quality of education focuses on the average composite SAT score at the manager’s undergraduate institution and Businessweek ranking of MBA programs. This information is combined with data on fund-specific control variables, <b>active</b> share, and <b>fund</b> duration. The data are used in OLS and logit regressions, and several robustness checks are performed. The results of the thesis imply that the quality of educational background has an impact on active management of equity mutual funds. First, there is evidence that managers from more selective undergraduate institutions and from the best MBA programs have higher average levels of active share than their peers. Additionally, managers without MBA education have higher average levels of active share compared to managers with an MBA of lower quality. Further, there is weak evidence that managers with CFAs have higher average levels of active share. Second, having graduated from a more selective undergraduate institution increases the likelihood of being responsible for diversified stock picking strategies, strategies involving very high levels of active share, as well as patient and active strategies. Third, there is some evidence that managers from the best MBA programs are more likely to invest in strategies involving very high levels of active share. However, this relation does not hold for diversified stock picking strategies or patient and active strategies. Finally, the results imply that managers who graduated from more selective undergraduate institutions and from the best MBA programs are less likely to have very low levels of active share, however this relation is not robust to using an alternative definition of closet indexing. Overall, the results are consistent with previous literature. First, the results are in line with studies suggesting that the most <b>active</b> <b>funds</b> have been rather successful in the past. Second, the findings are consistent with studies that suggest differences in performance among fund managers based on educational backgrounds. Even if no causal links can be inferred based on the results, the findings still imply that managers with better educational backgrounds are both more active on average and more likely to invest in the most active strategies. To summarize, the results highlight the usefulness of identifying the best educated fund managers both for investors looking for very <b>active</b> <b>funds</b> and <b>fund</b> <b>management</b> companies offering such funds...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficient}} markets hypothesis {{implies that}} passive indexing should generate as high a return as <b>active</b> <b>fund</b> <b>management.</b> Indexing {{has been a}} very successful strategy. We document a large value premium in the average q ratios of firms in the S&P 500 index relative to the q ratios of other similar firms that appears in the mid 1980 s and grows in step with the growth of indexing. Passive investment strategies that require the purchase of the particular 500 stocks in this index increase demand for those stocks and so push up their prices. In short, indexing induces downward sloping demand curves for stocks in the index. For reasons that are not fully clear, arbitrageurs apparently do not correct this overvaluation. ...|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{economic}} theory, {{applied to}} information released by listed companies, equates ‘useful’ with ‘price-sensitive’. Stock exchange rules accordingly prohibit the selec- tive, private communication of price-sensitive information. Yet, {{even in the}} absence of such communication, UK equity fund managers routinely meet privately with the senior execu- tives of the companies in which they invest. Moreover, they consider these brief, formal and formulaic meetings to be their most important sources of investment information. In this paper we ask how that can be. Drawing on interview and observation data with fund managers and CFOs, we find evidence for three, non-mutually exclusive explanations: that the characterisation of information in conventional economic theory is too restricted, that fund managers fail to act with the rationality that conventional economic theory assumes, and/or that the primary value of the meetings for fund managers is not related to their investment decision making but to the claims of superior knowledge made to clients in marketing their <b>active</b> <b>fund</b> <b>management</b> expertise. Our findings suggest a disconnect between economic theory and economic policy based on that theory, as well as a corre- sponding limitation in research studies that test information-usefulness by assuming it to be synonymous with price-sensitivity. We draw implications for further research into the role of tacit knowledge in equity investment decision-making, and also into the effects of the principal–agent relationship between fund managers and their clients...|$|E

40|$|In active {{portfolio}} management, {{fund managers}} seek to follow an investment strategy {{with the objective}} of outperforming an investment benchmark index. Opportunities to outperform a benchmark in <b>active</b> <b>fund</b> <b>management</b> is made possible through crosssectional dispersion of returns in the market. It is cross-sectional volatility of returns that allows fund managers to identify changing trends in market relationships and to take advantage of market opportunities. Quarterly active share and active return data of Domestic General Equity funds was used to determine whether the level of active share and active return has a correlation with volatility measures such as cross-sectional variance of returns or the South African Volatility Index (SAVI). The actively-managed funds’ outperformance of the benchmark index during periods of differing cross-sectional variance was also looked at. Lastly, the possibility of whether market volatility can be used to inform fund investment decisions was also examined. The findings in this study are that there is no significant relationship between the crosssectional variance of returns, active share and active returns. In measuring fund performance in times of differing cross-sectional dispersion and breaking the analysis period into such intervals rather than as a continuous time series, active funds outperform the benchmark index during periods of low and moderate cross-sectional variance.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comprehensive}} study of fund management in Norway, with particular emphasis on active management and performance. The utilized sample include 59 Norwegian equity mutual funds from 1996 - 2014. In general, we apply well-known methodologies with different modifications, investigating the degree of <b>active</b> <b>fund</b> <b>management</b> and fund performance. Our analyses {{can be divided into}} three separate examinations to keep contextual tidiness. The yielded results should, however, be contemplated in coherence. First, we look at the degree of active management using the statistical measure R 2. This is obtained from a regression of fund returns on a multifactor benchmark model. Lower R 2 indicates greater deviation from the benchmark, and our results indicate that half of the Norwegian equity funds are close to being index funds. We see that loading on the smallminus- big risk factor is particularly prevalent, and captures most of the deviation from the market. Second, we examine the hypothesis that fund performance can be predicted by its degree of active management. Equity funds sorted into highest quartile lagged R 2 generally outperforms the lowest quartile lagged R 2. However, we do not find enough consistency in our results to prove that R 2 is a credible predictor of performance. Moreover, we observe that the importance of preceding performance increases as R 2 decreases. Third, we examine the effects of fund characteristics on its degree of active management. Across funds, more active management is positively associated with expenses and fund age. In addition, the investment style coefficients show that more active funds invest in small size stocks. nhhma...|$|E
40|$|Launching a {{start-up}} hedge fund is a complex, multifaceted endeavor that {{requires an understanding}} of the interconnectivity between capital raising, investment strategy, regulation, and fund operations. The purpose of this document is to explore each of these categories and provide a plan for the launch of a hypothetical new fund (Broadgates Capital Management). In doing so, the key challenges of launching a new fund are uncovered, while clearly identifying how I would think about the fund's investment methodology and process. The hedge fund industry is increasingly competitive, with over 1, 000 new funds launching every year. In addition to these launches, more than 900 funds are liquidated annually. As investor expectations and regulatory guidelines continue to institutionalize hedge funds, managers are challenged with balancing not only the implementation of a value generating investment strategy, but also ensuring the efficient execution of the fund's operating/regulatory infrastructure. In order to successfully attract investors, all three of these critical elements must be in place. This paper argues that <b>active</b> <b>fund</b> <b>management</b> does in fact add value to investor portfolios and proposes a quantitative portfolio sorting strategy with a value-screen overlay. Broadgates Capital Management hopes to generate high risk adjusted returns by focusing on certain market anomalies while also utilizing traditional, value driven, fundamental analysis. An offshore master feeder fund structure will be utilized with the formation of a limited liability corporation as the management company. Finally, in order to raise between $ 100 and $ 150 million of investment capital, a meticulously constructed marketing strategy that articulates exactly why investors should choose Broadgates Capital Management is presented. by Jeffrey David Mills.

40|$|A {{method to}} rank mutual funds {{according}} to their investment style measured {{with respect to the}} returns of a reference portfolio (benchmark) is introduced. It is based on a style analysis model estimating a mutual fund portfolio composition as well as the benchmark one. Starting from such compositions, it computes a proximity measure based on the L 1 or L 2 norm to assess the similarity between each mutual fund portfolio returns and the benchmark returns as well as between the returns of each benchmark constituent and that of the corresponding mutual fund constituent. To this purpose the mean integrated absolute error and the mean integrated squared error are computed to derive both a global ranking of mutual <b>fund</b> <b>management</b> styles and partial rankings expressing the over- (under-) weighting of each portfolio constituent. A visual inspection of the results emphasizing main differences in management styles is provided, using a parallel coordinates plot. Since a modeling, a ranking and a visualizing approach are integrated, the method is named MoRaViA. From the practitioners' point of view, it allows the identification of a specific management style for each mutual <b>fund,</b> discriminating <b>active</b> <b>management</b> <b>funds</b> from passive <b>management</b> ones.

Investors prefer passsive funds in time of low risk-free rates and when <b>active</b> <b>funds</b> charge high <b>management</b> costs. Actively managed funds have a lower volatility but are only able to outperform the passive funds in downturns. Simulations confirm the emergence of two regimes: a regime where prices are close to fundamentals and another regime with a positive bubble.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a model of}} the <b>active</b> <b>fund</b> <b>management</b> industry (AFMI), and study the effect of a continuum of exogenous market concentration levels on the AFMI’s performance (net alphas), AFMI size, and AFMI direct benefits (differences between performance benefits and costs of efforts exerted to produce them). Risk-neutral managers compete for many risk-averse investors’ investments by optimally choosing costly effort and fees to deliver net alphas. Our model predicts that AFMI performance, size, and direct benefits increase (decrease) with market concentration if and only if gains from better investment opportunities due to higher concentration exceed (fall behind) the consequences of higher managerial costs. We then model endogenous concentration levels to fit empirical concentration measures. We empirically study the U. S. equity AFMI and find that, on average, AFMI net alphas and size increase with market concentration. Under current U. S. equity AFMI’s low market concentration, and with no change in managerial productivity/effort opportunity costs, increasing market concentration is likely to increase the AFMI’s net alphas, size, and direct benefits. We extend our model to global settings. Higher foreign market concentration, implying more unexplored investment opportunities, makes managerial effort more productive, attracting efforts. Consequently, unexplored investment opportunities in local markets rise, increasing local effort productivity. However, higher foreign market concentration allows foreign managers to demand higher compensation, driving up local managers’ reservation salaries, thus, effort costs. In equilibrium, higher foreign market concentration levels induce higher local net alphas, AFMI size, and the sum of direct benefits of managerial efforts spent in local and foreign markets if and only if gains from higher gross alpha production exceed consequences of higher managerial costs. Again, to fit data, we specialize our international model to an endogenous concentration framework and empirically study the effect of U. S. equity AFMI concentration on 30 global equity AFMIs. We find that 17 (5) markets’ AFMI net alphas and 9 (2) markets’ AFMI size, on average, are significantly negatively (positively) associated with U. S. equity AFMI concentration. Under no change in managerial productivity/effort costs, the current low, and probably decreasing, U. S. equity AFMI concentration would benefit a large proportion of global equity AFMIs...|$|E
40|$|Following the {{development}} and popularity of mutual funds among Swedish investors, the question of <b>active</b> <b>fund</b> <b>management</b> and return has become a central issue for private investors. 99 percent of the Swedish population invests in mutual funds, comprising a total net fund value of almost 2, 000 billion SEK. The idea behind active management is for a charged fee, to generate a return higher than {{the return of the}} market. But statistics indicate a low level of competition between the largest providers and only one out of ten funds performs better than its index. Financial instability due to the last decade’s two recessions has indeed caused fluctuating performance of actively managed Swedish mutual funds. It has also spurred academics to investigate the role and effect of active management and attached management fees. The main purpose of this research is to investigate if there exist differences between the performance of benchmark indices and the performance of actively managed equity funds, balanced funds and money market funds provided by seven Swedish banks; Folksam, Länsförsäkringar, Handelsbanken, Nordea, SEB, Skandia and Swedbank. We also seek to investigate if the level of fee and total risk affect the fund performance. The research was deductively conducted with a quantitative method of inquiry. The ontological and epistemological positions are objectivism and positivism. Our sample of 21 Swedish mutual funds, with daily price observations was investigated between 2004 and 2011, with a division of four subperiods. To answer our research question and sub-questions, ten fictive portfolios were created and five hypotheses were formulated based on previous research and theories within the field. The data was analyzed with paired samples T-tests and multiple linear regression analyses. The portfolios included three risk-adjusted fund performance measures and Value at Risk.     We have concluded that on average both balanced funds and money market funds have performed worse than their benchmark indices in the period 2004 to 2011. The equity funds have also performed worse than their benchmark index but the difference is not statistically significant. The balanced funds had the highest return, the money market funds second highest return and equity funds the lowest return. Supported by the multiple regression analyses, we have concluded that fund performance is negatively related to the level of total risk in the period 2004 to 2011. There is no statistical relationship between fund performance and fund provider. We finally conclude that fund return during the entire investigation period, is negatively related to management fees...|$|E
40|$|This study {{provides}} {{a critical review}} of the characteristics and performance of Islamic funds in Malaysia with the main objectives of identifying the return and risk profile of Islamic funds and examining the Islamic funds’ performance and valuation methods. The study was conceived {{on the back of}} the impressive growth of the Islamic fund industry amid abundant evidence and a common perception that Islamic funds generally underperform conventional funds. The study is designed to address four main areas, namely to analyse the return and risk characteristics of Islamic funds; to examine the performance trend of Islamic funds; to investigate the impact of Shariah-compliance requirements on Islamic funds’ performance; and, to explore the actual Islamic fund operation by fund management companies through the perception of those involved in the actual practice. To ensure that the study is undertaken thoroughly, the study employed the methodological triangulation technique, of which, the findings are deduced from three methods of analysis namely literature review, quantitative analysis, and qualitative analysis based on primary data collected through interviews. The findings of the study are deemed both intriguing and thought provoking. The study found that the existing Islamic funds have been created largely by mimicking conventional funds whilst economic motive, rather than religious motive, is arguably the main reason behind the creation of Islamic funds. Islamic funds are distinguished from conventional funds based on their Shariah identities, particularly with regards to stock selection and Shariah-compliance supervision. In general, relative to conventional funds, Islamic funds are characterised by a lower return but with higher volatility, have limited numbers of profitable stocks or industries whose returns are strongly and positively correlated, have a smaller fund size and low fund subscription rate, and are mainly invested in heavyweight stocks involved in defensive industries. Interestingly, although the Shariah-screening may expose Islamic funds’ portfolio to have high investment concentration in small-capitalised stocks, the study found that Islamic funds which invest mainly in large-capitalised stocks could outperform conventional funds and the market index. The analysis of Islamic fund performance is also sensitive to the benchmark used for performance comparison. The study also found that Shariah requirements affect Islamic funds’ performance adversely by incurring additional Shariah-related costs and introducing new Shariah non-compliance risks which are peculiar only to Islamic funds. In addition, the study revealed that there is a huge gap in terms of Shariah understanding and adoption of Shariah principles in the creation of Islamic funds. It is noted that despite the finding of Islamic funds’ underperformance, it can be argued that the evidence does not in any way represent a disadvantage of Islamic funds, considering that the underlying philosophy of the funds is not merely to maximise monetary return, but rather, to attain other non-pecuniary motives including adherence to religious principles and achievement of the objectives of the Shariah (maqasid al-shariah). With regards to Islamic fund performance valuation, the study found that the popular methods used by Islamic fund managers are the peer group comparison and the tracking error techniques instead of the traditional risk-adjusted return valuation models. The study also found that <b>active</b> <b>fund</b> <b>management</b> is probably the best strategy for Islamic funds in Malaysia as compared to the simple buy-and-hold or passive fund management strategy. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} tax {{efficiency}} of actively managed equity funds by conducting a previously unaddressed natural experiment. Specifically, we examine whether asset sales were timed {{to take advantage}} of the introduction of a substantial discount to realized capital gains when the holding period was at least 1 Â year. Institutional equity <b>fund</b> <b>management</b> in Australia is principally focused on the pre-fee and pre-tax performance surveys of leading asset consultants. Given this industry setting, our study is important because tax efficiency is not accounted for directly in the reported performance numbers, and is thus opaque.

40|$|In this {{performance}} evaluation study, two questions are addressed. First, do <b>active</b> <b>fund</b> managers possess macro and micro forecasting skills that deliver superior risk-adjusted returns? Second, {{what is the}} nature of market timing/stock selectivity trade off in the generation of alpha? The answers from this study are as follows: as an industry, managers delivered inferior returns for superannuation investors for the period 1991 through 1999. The study provides little evidence that the Australian <b>funds</b> <b>management</b> industry holds sufficient macro and/or micro forecasting abilities to generate positive alpha. While previous research has found that inferior market timing decisions are compensated for by superior stock selection skills, this study finds no substantive inverse relationship between timing and selectivity.
