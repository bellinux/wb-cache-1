5|$|Among other things, {{the episode}} was {{inspired}} by the history of baseball in Roswell, as well as the infamous 1947 Roswell Incident. Jesse Martin was offered the lead guest role as Exley after Duchovny noticed him in a production of the musical Rent and an episode of Ally McBeal. Originally, Darren McGavin was cast as Arthur Dales, but after he suffered a stroke, he was replaced by Walsh. Many of the outdoor baseball scenes were filmed at Jay Littleton Ballfield, an all-wood stadium located in Ontario, California. The episode has been critically examined for its use of literary motifs, its fairy tale-like structure, and its themes concerning racism <b>and</b> <b>alienation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since the attack, Canadians have debated various {{interpretations of}} the events, their significance, and Lépine's motives. Many feminist groups and public {{officials}} have characterized the massacre as an anti-feminist attack that is representative of wider societal violence against women. Consequently, {{the anniversary of the}} massacre has since been commemorated as the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women. Other interpretations emphasize Lépine's abuse as a child or suggest that the massacre was simply the isolated act of a madman, unrelated to larger social issues. Still other commentators have blamed violence in the media and increasing poverty, isolation, <b>and</b> <b>alienation</b> in society, particularly in immigrant communities.|$|E
5|$|Assigned male at birth, she {{was given}} the name Joshua Alcorn and raised in Ohio by a family {{affiliated}} with the Churches of Christ movement. At age 14, she came out as transgender to her parents, Carla and Doug Alcorn, who refused to accept her female gender identity. When she was 16, they denied her request to undergo transition treatment, instead sending her to Christian-based conversion therapy {{with the intention of}} convincing her to reject her gender identity and accept her gender as assigned at birth. After she revealed her attraction toward males to her classmates, her parents removed her from school and revoked her access to social media. In her suicide note, Alcorn cited loneliness <b>and</b> <b>alienation</b> as key reasons for her decision to end her life and blamed her parents for causing these feelings. She committed suicide by walking out in front of oncoming traffic on the Interstate 71 highway.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{notion of}} work {{alienation}} has been fascinating scholars and practitioners {{for a long}} time. In recent years, a related concept has been developed in the public administration discipline: policy alienation, which examines the alienation of public professionals from the policy they have to implement. In this paper, {{our goal is to}} study the distinctiveness (or similarity) of work <b>alienation</b> <b>and</b> policy <b>alienation.</b> Furthermore, we examine a number of effects of work <b>and</b> policy <b>alienation.</b> Based on a theoretical framework and a survey of 790 Dutch midwives, we show that work <b>and</b> policy <b>alienation</b> are clearly distinct concepts. Furthermore, we show that work alienation has a strong impact on work level outcomes, such as work effort and intention to leave the organization. Policy alienation strongly influences the intention of a worker to resist a new policy, and the related behavior. Hence, work <b>and</b> policy <b>alienation</b> have important but separate effects. This study underscores the usefulness of work <b>and</b> policy <b>alienation</b> for sociological <b>and</b> public administration researc...|$|R

Based on a survey of 790 respondents, it was first found that work alienation results in less work effort and more intention to leave. Second, policy alienation negatively affects behavioral support for a policy and the intention to implement it. These results suggest that work <b>alienation</b> <b>and</b> policy <b>alienation</b> have different—but both important—effects on (intended) behavior on the job...|$|R
5|$|Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladova, {{variously}} called Sonya and Sonechka, is {{the daughter}} of a drunkard named Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, whom Raskolnikov meets in a tavern {{at the beginning of the}} novel. She is often characterized as self-sacrificial, shy, and even innocent despite the fact that she is compelled into prostitution to help her family. She also, as Raskolnikov discerns, shares the same feelings of shame <b>and</b> <b>alienation</b> as he does and becomes the first person to whom Raskolnikov confesses his crime, and she supports him even though she was friends with one of the victims (Lizaveta). Throughout the novel, Sonya is an important source of moral strength and rehabilitation for Raskolnikov, and in some interpretations, even considered a Christ-like figure. She is forced to prostitute herself to provide for her family, leading some critics to make comparisons with Mary Magdalene.|$|E

40|$|Work {{engagement}} <b>and</b> work <b>alienation</b> {{are considered}} as bipolar opposites {{of each other}} by many researchers.

Confirmatory factor analysis on responses drawn from various occupational groups (N = 269) revealed that it’s erroneous to consider both the constructs to be the opposite ends of a single continuum. This inference is also reinforced by the pattern of relationship observed between work engagement <b>and</b> work <b>alienation</b> on one hand with their antecedents (i. e. occupational self efficacy and meaning) and consequences (job satisfaction and turnover intention) on the other.

This {{is a story}} of Japanese women {{community}} in America, in which the main character, Himiko is one of them and their difficulties in adapting themselves among American society. This study discusses the alienation experienced by the main character, Himiko Hamilton as one of Japanese "war brides" who marries an American serviceman. I would like to analyze Himiko's <b>alienation</b> <b>and</b> how the <b>alienation</b> influences much on her life. In order to analyze Himiko's alienation, I use literary approach with literary tools of characterization, and conflicts. To support my analysis, I also use two psychological concepts of <b>alienation,</b> social <b>alienation</b> <b>and</b> self <b>alienation.</b> In addition, to support my analysis, I also attach the social background of Japanese women and sexual nexus between American men and Japanese women. These two social backgrounds will help me to explain Himiko as a Japanese woman and her values which lead her to <b>alienation,</b> <b>and</b> how the interracial marriage between Himiko as a Japanese woman and her husband as an American man lead Himiko to alienation. The analysis will be about the causes of Himiko's <b>alienation</b> <b>and</b> its effects to her. The causes and the effects deal with social <b>alienation</b> <b>and</b> self <b>alienation,</b> in which both of them are experienced by the main character. After I analyze the main character's alienation, I come to the conclusion which shows the causes of Himiko's <b>alienation</b> <b>and</b> the effects, and how the effects of her alienation can bring Himiko to come to the decision to end her life, because life has been a failure for her...|$|R

25|$|Most times {{a foreign}} {{language}} is spoken in film, subtitles are used to translate the dialogue for the viewer. However, there are occasions when foreign dialogue is left unsubtitled (and thus incomprehensible {{to most of the}} target audience). This is often done if the movie is seen predominantly from the viewpoint of a particular character who does not speak the language. Such absence of subtitles allows the audience to feel a similar sense of incomprehension <b>and</b> <b>alienation</b> that the character feels. An example of this is seen in Not Without My Daughter. The Persian language dialogue spoken by the Iranian characters is not subtitled because the main character Betty Mahmoody does not speak Persian and the audience is seeing the film from her viewpoint.|$|E

25|$|From {{the late}} nineteenth century through the Great Depression, social and {{economic}} forces exerted a harmful impact on the structure of Bengal's income distribution and the ability of its agricultural sector to sustain the populace. These processes included a rapidly growing population, increasing household debt, stagnant agricultural productivity, increased social stratification, <b>and</b> <b>alienation</b> of the peasant class from their landholdings. The interaction of these left clearly defined social and economic groups mired in poverty and indebtedness, unable to cope with economic shocks or maintain their access to food beyond the near term. In 1942 and 1943, in the immediate and central context of the Second World War, the shocks Bengalis faced were numerous, complex and sometimes sudden. Millions were vulnerable to starvation.|$|E
25|$|While the Persians {{were making}} headway in their {{conquest of the}} eastern provinces, Phocas chose to divide his {{subjects}} rather than unite them against {{the threat of the}} Persians. Perhaps seeing his defeats as divine retribution, Phocas initiated a savage and bloody campaign to forcibly convert the Jews to Christianity. Persecutions <b>and</b> <b>alienation</b> of the Jews, a frontline people in the war against the Persians helped drove them into aiding the Persian conquerors. As Jews and Christians began tearing each other apart, some fled the butchery into Persian territory. Meanwhile, it appears that the disasters befalling the Empire led the Emperor into a state of paranoia — although it must be said that there were numerous plots against his rule and execution followed execution. Among those individuals who were executed was the former empress Constantina and her three daughters.|$|E

Attempts by previous earls of Derby to assert landlord rights had considerably unsettled the community. Wilson was charged by the ninth earl with gathering proposals for change from tenants, work which led to fruition under the tenth Earl, with the passing in the Tynwald of the Act of Settlement 1704. This was seen by islanders as their Magna Carta.

25|$|Global {{justice is}} the {{paramount}} to global security, because injustice {{can lead to}} feelings of anger, humiliation, <b>and</b> <b>alienation,</b> which can undermine human dignity. Al-Rodhan argues that humans are primarily driven by emotional self-interest and that protecting humans’ emotional needs is fundamental to human well-being and human dignity. When people {{feel that they have}} been the victim of unjust decisions, they may try and seek justice by less conventional means such as violence. This, in turn, can promote insecurity. Therefore, justice and not just military power, is essential to maintaining global security. Some obstacles might however arise. Al-Rodhan identifies the disparity in power that exists between states in the current global order as a major obstacle in achieving global justice. Calls for greater global justice are thus likely to continue from disadvantaged societies because they often feel that they are unjustly subjected to the rules set by more powerful players. However, dominant states that benefit from the current status quo are unlikely to want to alter established institutions or governance structures.|$|E
25|$|This {{mismatch}} {{also shows}} up in the phenomena of the supernormal stimulus, a stimulus that elicits a response more strongly than the stimulus for which the response evolved. The term was coined by Niko Tinbergen to refer to non-human animal behavior, but psychologist Deirdre Barrett said that supernormal stimulation governs the behavior of humans as powerfully as that of other animals. She explained junk food as an exaggerated stimulus to cravings for salt, sugar, and fats, and she says that television is an exaggeration of social cues of laughter, smiling faces and attention-grabbing action. Magazine centerfolds and double cheeseburgers pull instincts intended for an EEA where breast development was a sign of health, youth and fertility in a prospective mate, and fat was a rare and vital nutrient. The psychologist Mark van Vugt recently argued that modern organizational leadership is a mismatch. His argument is that humans are not adapted to work in large, anonymous bureaucratic structures with formal hierarchies. The human mind still responds to personalized, charismatic leadership primarily in the context of informal, egalitarian settings. Hence the dissatisfaction <b>and</b> <b>alienation</b> that many employees experience. Salaries, bonuses and other privileges exploit instincts for relative status, which attract particularly males to senior executive positions.|$|E
