5|$|Despite {{originally}} {{being told}} by Redknapp he was not of Division One standard, let alone suitable for the Premier League, Primus proved his manager wrong by seizing his chance when other players missed out through injury and suspension. By {{the end of the}} 2002–03 season he had become a vital member of the side that won the Division One title, winning the Portsmouth fans' player of the season as well as the PFA accolade for Division One. He scored once that season for Portsmouth in the League Cup against Peterborough United. Primus credits his renaissance to his conversion to Christianity after <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wife's invited him to church.|$|E

5|$|Casting English-speaking lead {{actors in}} Spaghetti Westerns was a growing {{practice}} {{because it was}} believed to allow international marketability. Marcello Mastroianni had conceived {{the idea of a}} mute gunfighter when he told Corbucci that he had always wanted to appear in a Western, but would have been held back by his inability to speak English. When Corbucci first met Jean-Louis Trintignant, who was hired for the leading role of the film by Les Films Corona after it was turned down by Franco Nero (who had previously played the title character of Django), he learned that Trintignant did not speak English either. To bypass the need for an English-speaking lead, Corbucci decided to turn Trintignant's character into a mute. At the time, Trintignant was known {{for his role in the}} critically acclaimed romantic drama A Man and a Woman, and is believed to have accepted the role in support of co-producer Robert Dorfmann, who was <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>his.</b> Silence was his only role in a Spaghetti Western.|$|E

They had four children, Everard Earle (Tev, b. 1892), Keith de Suffield (b. 1894), Isabelle Iris (b. 1895), and Betty Marion (b. 1899).

5|$|Growing up, Bueno {{worked as}} a paperboy at the {{newsstand}} of his grandmother, Hortensia. In 1984, he attended concerts of the local band Chébere and was occasionally invited to join them on stage. The next year, {{he dropped out of}} school and started working at his father's record shop, where he sometimes sang for the customers. <b>A</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father belonged to the local band Manto Negro and offered Rodrigo a spot in the band. This is where he formally started his career in music, signing his first contract and earning his first salary as a musician at age thirteen.

5|$|He saved {{money and}} his father helped him out to buy a drum kit made by a Japanese toy company, which was for sale by <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sister Cecilia. He set up the kit in his bedroom and his parents gave him certain times to practice. Then his father got him into the Post Office Workers Band, which played orchestral melodies with percussion, along with marching band standards. He {{attended}} Scoil Colmcille, Marlborough Street, Dublin. He took the exams for Chanel College and St. Paul's, two Catholic schools his father wanted his son to attend. After the accidental death of Larry's younger sister in 1973, his father gave {{up the idea of}} pushing his son into those schools and sent Larry to Mount Temple Comprehensive School, the first interdenominational school in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Himmler and Potthast confessed {{their love}} for each other at Christmastime in 1938. At first they tried to keep it platonic, but they fell into an adulterous {{relationship}}. Himmler's wife since 1928 and mother of their daughter, Margarete Himmler, found out about Himmler's relationship with Potthast at some time in February 1941. She felt humiliated and bitter, and Potthast's parents rejected the extramarital relationship. Potthast first took up residence in Grunewald and from 1943 she lived in Brückentin, near the estate of Oswald Pohl, because she was <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wife, Eleonore. Lina Heydrich, wife of Himmler's right-hand man Reinhard Heydrich, and Gerda Bormann, spouse of Martin Bormann, were also counted among her friends. Later she lived in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria.|$|E

5|$|In 1631 Wiśniowiecki {{returned}} to the Commonwealth and took over from his uncle the management of his father's huge estate, which included {{a large part of}} what is now Ukraine. In 1632 he converted from Eastern Orthodoxy to Catholicism, an action that caused much concern in Ukraine. His decision has been analyzed by historians, and often criticized, particularly in Ukrainian historiography. The Orthodox Church feared to lose a powerful protector, and Isaiah Kopinsky, metropolitan bishop of Kiev and <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother, unsuccessfully pleaded with him to change his mind. Jeremi would not budge although he remained on decent terms with the Orthodox Church, avoiding provocative actions, and supported his uncle and Orthodox bishop Peter Mogila and his Orthodox Church collegium.|$|E
5|$|In {{previous}} works, Hergé {{had drawn}} upon {{a variety of}} pictorial sources, such as newspaper clippings, from which to draw the scenes and characters; for The Secret of the Unicorn he drew upon an unprecedented variety of these sources. In drawing {{many of the old}} vessels, Hergé initially consulted the then recently published L'Art et la Mer ("Art and the Sea") by Alexandre Berqueman. Seeking further accurate depictions of old naval vessels, Hergé consulted <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>his,</b> Gérard Liger-Belair, who owned a Brussels shop specialising in model ships. Liger-Belair produced plans of a 17th-century French fifty-gun warship for Hergé to copy; Le Brillant, which had been constructed in Le Havre in 1690 by the shipwright Salicon and then decorated by Jean Bérain the Elder.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Tahsi is {{approached}} by a thief (Danielle Burgio), who has fled to Guam with a stolen rare jade dragon and wants to pawn it, promising to return in 24 hours. Tahsi agrees, but does not promise not to sell it.

She later has it appraised, learning it is worth many times more than she paid for it, heightening her hopes of paying the tuition for her sister's medical degree. Later, an enforcer (Arnold Chon) for the yakuza group Black Dragons, the original owners of the jade dragon, appears in Tahsi's shop with the thief in a headlock, demanding the figurine's return. Tahsi refuses to reveal Jane's identity and is killed along with the thief.|$|E

5|$|Lie and {{his family}} {{returned}} to Buitenzorg in 1866. At the time there were no schools offering a European-style education in the city, and thus {{he was sent to}} a Chinese-run school. For three years, in which the youth studied under three different headmasters, he was made to repeat traditional Hokkien phrases and copy Chinese characters without understanding them. Tio suggests that Lie obtained little knowledge at the school, and until his death Lie was unable to understand Chinese. During his time in Buitenzorg, he studied painting under Raden Saleh, <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father's. Although he reportedly showed skill, he did not continue the hobby as his mother disapproved. He also showed a propensity for traditional literary forms such as pantun (a form of poetry) and was fond of creating his own.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Marx's childhood. The third of nine children, he became the oldest son when his brother Moritz died in 1819. Young Marx and his {{surviving}} siblings, Sophie, Hermann, Henriette, Louise, Emilie and Caroline were baptised into the Lutheran Church along with their mother in August 1824. Young Marx was privately educated by his father until 1830, when he entered Trier High School, whose headmaster, Hugo Wyttenbach, was <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father. By employing many liberal humanists as teachers, Wyttenbach incurred the anger of the local conservative government. Subsequently, police raided the school in 1832 and discovered that literature espousing political liberalism was being distributed among the students. Considering the distribution of such material a seditious act, the authorities instituted reforms and replaced several staff during Marx's attendance.|$|E

The sword is the original bat'leth, used by Kahless to defeat the tyrant Molor. Kor received a shroud from a Vulcan science team, which he believes once held the Sword. He gives it to Jadzia to test the shroud's authenticity. As he returns to his quarters, Kor is attacked by a Lethean who reads his thoughts in order to find out about the Sword and then removes his memories of the attack. Jadzia finds him the following morning, and thinks that he has passed out from too much alcohol. She has verified the authenticity of the shroud. Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) lends the trio a Runabout to travel into the Gamma Quadrant to search for the sword on a planet where the Vulcan team found the shroud.|$|E
