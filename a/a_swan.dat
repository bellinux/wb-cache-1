5|$|Another legend is that once, while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva {{appeared}} as a flame, and challenged them to find his source. Brahma {{took the form of}} <b>a</b> <b>swan,</b> and flew to the sky to see the top of the flame, while Vishnu became the boar Varaha, and sought its base. The scene is called lingothbava, and is represented in the western wall at the sanctum of most Shiva temples. Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship.|$|E

500|$|The English-language {{place name}} [...] "Black Swan" [...] occurs as a {{descriptive}} toponym in four states, usually as a [...] "name cluster". Queensland has <b>a</b> Black <b>Swan</b> Creek near Gladstone, together with nearby Black <b>Swan</b> Island and <b>a</b> Black <b>Swan</b> Rock further south near Shoalwater Bay; another Black Swan Creek near Maryborough; and <b>a</b> Black <b>Swan</b> Lagoon inland on the Darling Downs near Warwick. New South Wales has <b>a</b> Black <b>Swan</b> Anabranch adjoining <b>a</b> Black <b>Swan</b> Lagoon {{on the north}} side of the Murray River in the Corowa Shire. In South Australia's arid north, there is <b>a</b> Black <b>Swan</b> Swamp just north of Roxby Downs and <b>a</b> Black <b>Swan</b> Waterhole further north of the old Overland Telegraph line. Tasmania has <b>a</b> Black <b>Swan</b> Island near the wild South West Cape. Given the broad sweep of the black swan's natural habitat, the presence of only nine distinctive place names or name clusters within that range indicates the rarity of [...] "Black Swan" [...] as a toponym. New Zealand also has <b>a</b> Black <b>Swan</b> Stream in the South Auckland district.|$|R

5|$|The Dying Swan (originally The Swan) is a solo choreographed by Mikhail Fokine in 1905 to Camille Saint-Saëns's Le Cygne from Le Carnaval des animaux as a pièce d'occasion for the {{ballerina}} Anna Pavlova, {{who performed}} it about 4,000 times. The short ballet (4 minutes) follows the last {{moments in the}} life of <b>a</b> <b>swan,</b> and was first presented in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1905. The ballet has since influenced modern interpretations of Odette in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake and has inspired non-traditional interpretations and various adaptations.|$|E

In 1849 Hall secured reproduction rights to the 157 paintings which Vernon had given to the nation but declined to distribute reproductions of Candaules, despite his willingness to publish reproductions of other provocative Etty nudes such as Female Bathers Surprised by <b>a</b> <b>Swan.</b>|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle hunts mainly aquatic animals, such as fish, turtles and sea snakes, but {{it takes}} birds, such as little penguins, Eurasian coots and shearwaters, and mammals (including flying foxes) as well. In the Bismarck Archipelago it has been {{reported}} feeding on two species of possum, the northern common cuscus and common spotted cuscus. It is a skilled hunter, and will attack prey up to the size of <b>a</b> <b>swan.</b> They also feed on carrion such as dead sheep, birds and fish found along the waterline, as well as raiding fishing nets and following cane harvesters.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} stratum, a {{courtyard}} surrounded by several rooms, {{which is part}} of a large courtyard building, was discovered. The remains of the structure included the foundations and fragments of roof tiles, which most likely, covered the rooms and were found on the surface. The source of the roof tiles is the port of Marseilles, France, and most were stamped with the heart-shaped emblem of the Roux Frères roof-tile factory. The roof tiles indicate that the building was erected {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century CE. Several other roof tiles were stamped with <b>a</b> <b>swan</b> symbol, these were probably imported in a later phase of the building’s existence, at the beginning of the twentieth century, for the purpose of repair. According to Micah Linn of Mishmar HaEmek, the building was no longer standing at the time when the kibbuz was founded and therefore, it is estimated to have been in use for only several decades.|$|E
5|$|The gardens at West Wycombe Park {{are among}} the finest and most {{idiosyncratic}} 18th century gardens surviving in England. The park is unique in its consistent use of Classical architecture from both Greece and Italy. The principal architect of the gardens was Nicholas Revett, who designed many of the ornamental buildings in the park. The landscape architect Thomas Cook began to execute {{the plans for the}} park, with a nine-acre man-made lake created from the nearby River Wye in the form of <b>a</b> <b>swan.</b> The lake originally had a snow (a sailing vessel) for the amusement of Dashwood's guests, complete with a resident captain on board. Water leaves the lake down a cascade and into a canal pond.|$|E

Each time Mr. Mallard selects a location, Mrs. Mallard finds something wrong with it. Tired from their search, the mallards land at the Public Garden Lagoon to spend the night. In the morning, <b>a</b> <b>swan</b> boat passes by the mallards. The mallards mistake the swan boat for a real bird and enjoy peanuts thrown by {{the people on the}} boat. Mrs. Mallard suggests that they build their nest in the Public Garden. However, just as she says this, her husband is nearly run down by a passing bicyclist. The mallards continue their search, flying over Boston landmarks such as Beacon Hill, the Massachusetts State House, and Louisburg Square. The Mallards finally decide on an island in the Charles River. From this island, the Mallards visit a policeman named Michael on the shore, who feeds them peanuts every day.|$|E

5|$|Another legend is that once, while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva {{appeared}} as a flame, and challenged them to find his source.

Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship. In Tamil, the word Arunam means red or fire and Asalam means hill. Since Shiva manifested himself in the form of fire in this place, this name Arunachalam came to be associated with Annamalai hill and the town. The first mention of Annamalai is found in Tevaram, the seventh century Tamil Saiva canonical work by Appar and Tirugnanasambandar.|$|E
5|$|Parasaurolophus {{is often}} {{hypothesized}} {{to have used}} its crest as a resonating chamber to produce low frequency sounds to alert other {{members of a group}} or its species. This function was originally suggested by Wiman in 1931 when he described P. tubicen. He noted that the crests internal structures {{are similar to those of}} <b>a</b> <b>swan,</b> and theorized that an animal could use its elongated nasal passages to create noise. However, the nasal tubes of Hypacrosaurus, Corythosaurus, and Lambeosaurus are much more variable and complicated than the airway of Parasaurolophus. A large amount of material and data supports the hypothesis that the large, tubular crest of Parasaurolophus was a resonating chamber. Weishampel in 1981 suggested that Parasaurolophus made noises ranging between the frequencies 55 and 720 Hz, although there was some difference in the range of individual species because of the crest size, shape, and nasal passage length, most obvious in P. cyrtocristatus (interpreted as a possible female). Hopson found that there is anatomical evidence that hadrosaurids had strong hearing. There is at least one example, in the related Corythosaurus, of a slender stapes (reptilian ear bone) in place, which combined with a large space for an eardrum implies a sensitive middle ear. Furthermore, the hadrosaurid lagena is elongate like a crocodilian's, indicating that the auditory portion of the inner ear was well-developed. Based on similarity of hadrosaurid inner ears to those of crocodiles, he also proposed that adult hadrosaurids were sensitive to high frequencies, such as their offspring might produce. According to Weishampel, this is consistent with parents and offspring communicating.|$|E
25|$|In Greek mythology, Cygnus {{has been}} {{identified}} with several different legendary swans.

500|$|There {{are three}} grants of arms to {{corporations}} that include <b>a</b> black <b>swan.</b> In 1931, the Bank of New South Wales (now Westpac) was granted arms with <b>a</b> black <b>swan</b> supporter {{alluding to the}} Bank's acquisition of the Western Australian Bank in 1927. In the same year, the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons was granted arms with <b>a</b> black <b>swan</b> {{in the first and}} fourth quarters, apparently derived from the Australian Arms. In 1965, the Australian Academy of Science was granted arms with <b>a</b> black <b>swan</b> as <b>a</b> crest, alluding to the Academy's [...] "Australianness" [...] and its location in Canberra. The black swan has not been used in the arms of any university or residential college in eastern Australia.|$|R
