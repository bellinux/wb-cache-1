This type of <b>antigen-binding</b> <b>fragment</b> is called Fcab. Fcab fragments can be inserted into a full immunoglobulin by swapping the Fc region, thus obtaining a bispecific antibody (with both Fab and Fcab regions containing distinct binding sites).

30|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} of developing a new multimodality cell tracking method, combining the optical sensitivity and the quantitative possibilities of nuclear imaging with the advantageous physico-chemical properties of nanobodies. Nanobodies are the <b>antigen-binding</b> <b>fragments</b> from heavy-chain-only antibodies naturally occurring in Camelidae [[9]]. Nanobodies {{are considered to be}} the smallest intact <b>antigen-binding</b> <b>fragments</b> derived from a functional antibody. Their limited size of approximately 15  kDa and their general robustness make them very suitable for in vivo imaging [[10]]. Nanobodies labelled with 99 mTc have been used for targeting specific epitopes in vivo, for example, CEA and EGFR 2 [[11],[12]].|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{investigate}} {{the role of the}} constant domainson the antigen-binding property of the variable domains, we have carried out a comparative thermodynamic study of the anti-dansyl Fv, Fab* and Fab fragments that possess the identical amino acid sequence of the variable domains. The thermodynamic analyses have shown that binding constants, enthalphy changes and entropy changes are similar for the three <b>antigen-binding</b> <b>fragments,</b> whereas the thermal stability of Fab is much higher than that of Fv and Fab*. We have concluded that (i) the variable domains of the three <b>antigen-binding</b> <b>fragments</b> possess identical intrinsic capability for antigen binding and (ii) the two constant domains serve to improve the stability of the variable domains...|$|R
40|$|<b>Antigen-binding</b> <b>fragments,</b> such as single-domain {{antibodies}} (sdAbs), can now {{be readily}} isolated by in vitro technologies. Antibody fragment libraries derived from immune or nonimmune sources are presented in a molecular display format, typically phage display, and binders to individual antigens are selected from the libraries by a so-called panning process. Nonimmune libraries can serve as sources of binders {{to a wide range}} of targets but yield <b>antigen-binding</b> <b>fragments</b> that generally have much lower affinities than those obtained from immune sources. Here we describe a strategy for constructing pentameric sdAbs termed pentabodies.

The T cell receptor genes are similar to immunoglobulin genes in that they too contain multiple V, D and J gene segments in their beta chains (and V and J gene segments in their alpha chains) that are rearranged during {{the development of the}} lymphocyte to provide that cell with a unique antigen receptor. The T cell receptor in this sense is the topological equivalent to an <b>antigen-binding</b> <b>fragment</b> of the antibody, both being part of the immunoglobulin superfamily.|$|E

40|$|For high-sensitive and {{specific}} protein sensing using graphene field-effect transistors (G-FETs), the <b>antigen-binding</b> <b>fragment</b> (Fab), {{which is a}} component of conventional antibody, was functionalized onto the graphene surface. Since {{the height of the}} Fab is approximately 3 nm, the antigen-antibody reaction is expected to occur inside the electrical-double layer in the buffer solution. After functionalization of Fab onto the G-FET, the transfer characteristics shifted in the positive gate-voltage direction, indicating that the Fab was successfully modified onto the graphene surface. And then, plots of the conductance change and the target proteins concentration were fitted by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm.

40|$|We have {{determined}} the three-dimensional {{structures of the}} <b>antigen-binding</b> <b>fragment</b> of the anti-digoxin monoclonal antibody 26 - 10 in the uncomplexed state at 2. 7 A resolution and as a complex with digoxin at 2. 5 A resolution. Neither the antibody nor digoxin undergoes any significant conformational changes upon forming the complex. Digoxin interacts primarily with the antibody heavy chain and is oriented such that the carbohydrate groups are exposed to solvent and the lactone ring is buried in a deep pocket {{at the bottom of}} the combining site. Despite extensive interactions between antibody and antigen, no hydrogen bonds or salt links are formed between 26 - 10 and digoxin. Thus the 26 - 10 -digoxin complex is unique among the known three-dimensional structures of antibody-antigen complexes in that specificity and high affinity arise primarily from shape complementarity...|$|E

The structure of the full-length KcsA–Fab complex reveals a well-defined, 4 -helix bundle that projects ≈ 70 Å toward the cytoplasm. This bundle promotes a ≈ 15 ° bending in the inner bundle gate, tightening its diameter and shifting the narrowest point 2 turns of helix below.

Three general types of <b>fragments</b> were observed, <b>antigen-binding</b> <b>fragments</b> (Fab), single chain variable fragments (scFv) and “third generation” (3 G), each representing a successive wave of antibody fragment technology. In parallel, drug developers have explored multi-specificity and conjugation with exogenous functional moieties in all three fragment types.

The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method and has been refined to an R-factor of 18. 9 % at 2. 8 A resolution.

40|$|Invasion of {{erythrocytes}} by Plasmodial merozoites is {{a composite}} process involving the interplay of several proteins. Among them, the Plasmodium falciparum Cysteine-Rich Protective Antigen (PfCyRPA) is a crucial component of a ternary complex, including Reticulocyte binding-like Homologous protein 5 (PfRH 5) and the RH 5 -interacting protein (PfRipr), essential for erythrocyte invasion. Here, we present the crystal structures of PfCyRPA and its complex with the <b>antigen-binding</b> <b>fragment</b> of a parasite growth inhibitory antibody. PfCyRPA adopts a 6 -bladed β-propeller structure with similarity to the classic sialidase fold, but it has no sialidase activity and fulfills a purely non-enzymatic function. Characterization of the epitope recognized by protective antibodies may facilitate design of peptidomimetics to focus vaccine responses on protective epitopes.

Effective targeting of imaging agents to MR-expressing cells is a potential approach for atherosclerotic plaque imaging. The feasibility of imaging of plaques with 18 F-labelled d-mannose (2 -deoxy- 2 -[18 F]fluoro-d-mannose, 18 F-FDM) was reported by Tahara et al. [14]. They have demonstrated that 18 F-FDM uptake is non-inferior to 18 F-FDG uptake for imaging of plaque inflammation [14].

To elucidate the mechanisms of recognition and inhibition of αVβ 3 integrin, we solved the structure of the LM 609 <b>antigen-binding</b> <b>fragment</b> by X-ray crystallography and determined its binding affinity for αVβ 3. Using single-particle electron microscopy, we show that LM 609 binds at the interface between the β-propeller domain of the αV chain and the βI domain of the β 3 chain, near the RGD-binding site, of all observed integrin conformational states. Integrating these data with fluorescence size-exclusion chromatography, we demonstrate that LM 609 sterically hinders access of large ligands to the RGD-binding pocket, without obstructing it.
