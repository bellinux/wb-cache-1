5|$|In the 1994 U.S. Senate {{election}} in Massachusetts, Kennedy faced his first serious challenger, the young, telegenic, and very well-funded Mitt Romney. Romney ran {{as a successful}} entrepreneur and Washington outsider with a strong family image and moderate stands on social issues, while Kennedy was saddled not only with his recent past but the 25th anniversary of Chappaquiddick and his first wife Joan seeking a renegotiated divorce settlement. By mid-September 1994, polls showed the race to be even. Kennedy's campaign ran short on money, and belying his image as endlessly wealthy, {{he was forced to}} take out <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>mortgage</b> on his Virginia home. Kennedy responded with a series of attack ads, which focused both on Romney's shifting political views and on the treatment of workers at a paper products plant owned by Romney's Bain Capital. Kennedy's new wife Vicki proved to be a strong asset in campaigning. Kennedy and Romney held a widely watched late October debate without a clear winner, but by then Kennedy had pulled ahead in polls and stayed ahead afterward. In the November election, despite a very bad outcome for the Democratic Party nationally, Kennedy won re-election by a 58percent to 41percent margin, the closest re-election race of his career.|$|E

40|$|High loan-to-value (LTV) {{mortgage}} are residential {{mortgage loans}} with LTV ratio greater {{or equal to}} 90 %. Lenders are increasingly engaged in risk-based pricing. If properly quantified, the additional credit risk taken when originating high LTV mortgage can be compensated by higher interest rate charged to customers. High LTV mortgage is regulated to meet higher capital requirement and thus have higher funding cost. Current regulation raises regulatory capital requirement of banks on all high LTV mortgage holdings. However, it is not efficient to differentiate the risk between a high LTV first <b>mortgage</b> and <b>a</b> <b>second</b> lien <b>mortgage</b> with the same LTV. In the paper, I show how LTV ratio affects credit risk in mortgage. A structured credit modeling approach is taken to quantify the credit risk of first <b>mortgage</b> and <b>second</b> <b>mortgage.</b> The total risk in a combination of first and <b>second</b> <b>mortgage</b> is shown to be {{equal to that of}} a first mortgage with the same aggregate LTV. Default risk is derived implicitly. Optionality of defaultable debt results in an upward sloping credit supply curve in terms of a function of interest rate with respect to LTV.

Originally {{purchasing}} a convenience store, which they bought with cash advances on 17 credit cards and <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>mortgage</b> on Gilliland's mother's house, the pair decided to buy a natural foods market, Crystal Market, which they felt would prosper in health-conscious Boulder. The $300,000 purchase, completed in 1987, thrust the couple into an environment {{quite different from the}} junk-food focus of convenience stores, an environment that gradually persuaded Gilliland and Cook to become healthy eaters themselves. In that first store, Gilliland worked the counter, while Cook worked the deli. Soon, the couple had opened another natural foods store, {{on the south side of}} Boulder, called Wild Oats Community Market. As the Wild Oats business expanded, a holding company was formed, and Gilliland became chief executive officer and president, while Cook became vice-president and in-house attorney.|$|E

The McGovern–Hatfield Amendment to the annual military procurement bill, co-sponsored by Republican Mark Hatfield of Oregon, required via funding cutoff a complete withdrawal of all American forces from Indochina {{by the end of}} 1970. It underwent months of public discussion and alterations to make it acceptable to more senators, including pushing the deadline out to the end of 1971.

The effort was denounced by opposition groups organized by White House aide Charles Colson, which called McGovern and Hatfield [...] "apostles of retreat and defeat" [...] and [...] "salesmen of surrender" [...] and maintained that only the president could conduct foreign policy.

This paper investigates the determinants of <b>second</b> <b>mortgage</b> borrowing and the characteristics of <b>second</b> <b>mortgage</b> borrowers. We first calculate the outstanding stock of home equity that remains to be borrowed against on tax-preferred terms, recognizing the limits on interest deductions in the 1986 Tax Reform Act and the 1987 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. Despite these limits, we estimate that more than two trillion dollars of housing equity remains to be borrowed against by current homeowners. We then present cross-sectional evidence suggesting that households who obtain <b>second</b> <b>mortgages</b> after purchasing <b>a</b> home ace less wealthy than other households with similar characteristics. Each dollar of <b>second</b> <b>mortgage</b> borrowing is associated with a seventy-five cent reduction in household net worth. While these results cannot be given a causal interpretation, they are consistent with the view that increased access to <b>second</b> <b>mortgages</b> has reduced personal saving. ...|$|R
5000|$|The VA loan allows {{veterans}} 103.3 percent financing without private {{mortgage insurance}} or <b>a</b> 20 percent <b>second</b> <b>mortgage</b> {{and up to}} $6,000 for energy efficient improvements. A VA funding fee of 0 to 3.3% of the loan amount is paid to the VA; this fee may also be financed. In a purchase, veterans may borrow up to 103.3% of the sales price or reasonable value of the home, whichever is less. Since there is no monthly PMI, more of the mortgage payment goes directly towards qualifying for the loan amount, allowing for larger loans with the same payment. In a refinance, where a new VA loan is created, veterans may borrow up to 100% of reasonable value, where allowed by state laws. In a refinance where the loan is a VA loan refinancing to VA loan (IRRRL Refinance), the veteran may borrow up to 100.5% of the total loan amount. The additional [...]5% is the funding fee for an VA Interest Rate Reduction Refinance.|$|R
