5|$|Generally, no {{separate}} food offerings {{are cooked}} for the goddess Vimala. The goddess is described {{to survive on}} the remnants (Ucchishta) of Jagannath's meals. The vegetarian food offerings to Jagannath are offered to Vimala, after which they are sanctified as Mahaprasad (see also prasad). The Mahaprasad consists of dried rice mixed with grated coconut, cheese, curd and butter. The Shankaracharya, head of the Govardhana matha, receives a pot of the mahaprasad <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> <b>of</b> khichdi that is offered to the goddess, the presiding goddess (Adya-shakti) of the matha {{as well as of}} the temple.|$|E
500|$|The Hamilcar was {{constructed}} primarily from wood, mainly birch and spruce, with fabric-covered plywood forming the skin, and {{high grade steel}} reinforcement beams in critical areas. It had a wingspan of , a length of [...] and a height of [...] {{to the top of}} the fin with the tail down. It weighed [...] when empty, and could transport a military load of [...] to give a total weight of [...] The whole aircraft was broken down into smaller sections for transport. It was so large and heavy that it required the largest and most powerful aircraft to pull it off the airfield and subsequently tow it; four-engined bombers were used, most frequently the Handley Page Halifax. Both wing and cockpit were set above the fuselage to provide the greatest amount of room for the cargo compartment, and to ensure that they did not interfere with the loading of vehicles; the compartment measured approximately , [...] inches wide and between [...] and [...] inches in height. The nose of the glider was hinged and opened to the side for ease of loading vehicles and cargo, and the crew of two pilots were seated in tandem in a cockpit on the top of the fuselage, which was accessed via an internal ladder and was fifteen feet above ground; they were eventually protected by a bullet-proof windscreen <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> <b>of</b> armour behind the second pilot. An intercom was also added to provide communication between the pilots and the personnel below them. An initial design feature, which was eventually removed prior to full-scale production, was the installation of an under-fuselage hatch which would allow the prone firing of a Bren light machine gun as the glider approached the landing zone.|$|E
2500|$|A6M5c, Model 52丙 (Hei, c) – Armament change: One 13.2mm (.51in) Type 3 {{machine gun}} was added in each wing {{outboard}} of the cannon, and the 7.7mm {{gun on the}} left side of the cowl was deleted. [...] Four racks for rockets or small bombs were installed outboard of the 13mm gun in each wing. [...] Engine change: Some sources state that the hei had a Sakae 31 engine [...] In addition, a 55mm thick piece of armored glass was installed at the headrest <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> <b>of</b> armor was installed behind the seat. [...] The mounting of the central 300L drop tank changed to a four-post design. [...] Wing skin was thickened further. The first of this variant was completed in September 1944. [...] Because of the gain in weight, this variant was used mainly for intercepting B-29s and special attack.|$|E

2500|$|Lou's {{original}} character outline {{as written}} by series creators Julia Smith and Tony Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, :"A lively 70 year old. Archetypal East-end mother-earth figure. Fat, funny, sometimes loud, often openly sentimental. An obsessive view of family...she {{can be a}} stubborn cruel [...] "old bag" [...] when she wants to be, sometimes keeping [...] "atmospheres" [...] going for months. It was always Lou's house that {{was used for the}} big family celebrations. Especially Christmas. Twenty or more people crammed into a tiny house. Five sisters wedged into a minuscule kitchen; drinking gin and orange; wearing funny hats; all wearing aprons; laughing raucously and trying to cook a huge dinner at the same time. Lou's house was also the meeting place for the family Sunday teas. Ham, or tinned salmon salad. Bread and butter. Jelly and tinned cream. And, tea...the changing face of the area (especially the immigrants) is a constant source of fear to her, but then she doesn't go out much. She prefers to be at home, or on a trip down memory lane: day trips to Southend – the Kursal, Rossi's ice-cream <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> <b>of</b> cockles; one wonderful week's holiday in a caravan in Clacton; fruit picking in Essex; Christmas; weddings; street parties...She has a soft spot for her son, Pete..."

60|$|It {{was exactly}} twenty minutes after their {{entrance}} into the teashop when the woman finished her monologue. She began to draw on her gloves again.

60|$|The children's faces {{showed that}} they knew nothing at all as, with open eyes, they trotted and turned beside the long-striding old man.
