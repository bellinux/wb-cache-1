500|$|... "The Chinese Restaurant" [...] {{was first}} read by its cast on December 5, 1990, {{and it was}} filmed on December 11. Filming took place at CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles, California, where all filming for the second season took place. As only one {{location}} was used, it took roughly half {{of the time it}} usually took for an episode to be filmed. Cast members have remarked that the filming was shorter than on any other episode. A few changes were made; in the first draft of the script, George, Jerry, and Elaine entered the restaurant talking about their least favorite holiday. In the version that aired, they talk about combining the jobs of policemen and garbagemen into a single job. In the original draft, the three friends also discussed how to spend the long waiting period in the future, with George suggesting they bring a deck of cards and that Jerry bring <b>a</b> <b>jigsaw</b> <b>puzzle</b> with nothing but penguins. One scene was cut before broadcast, featuring George explaining to Jerry that he pulled his hamstring while trying to untuck the covers of a hotel bed during his recent stay in Boston. George can be seen grabbing his hamstring as he walks to the phone. The scene was later included on the Seinfeld seasons one and two DVD boxset.|$|E
500|$|Consequently, paleontologists must usually rely on {{stratigraphy}} to date fossils. Stratigraphy is {{the science}} of deciphering the [...] "layer-cake" [...] that is the sedimentary record, and {{has been compared to}} <b>a</b> <b>jigsaw</b> <b>puzzle.</b> Rocks normally form relatively horizontal layers, with each layer younger than the one underneath it. If a fossil is found between two layers whose ages are known, the fossil's age must lie between the two known ages. Because rock sequences are not continuous, but may be broken up by faults or periods of erosion, {{it is very difficult to}} match up rock beds that are not directly next to one another. However, fossils of species that survived for a relatively short time can be used to link up isolated rocks: this technique is called biostratigraphy. For instance, the conodont [...] Eoplacognathus pseudoplanus has a short range in the Middle Ordovician period. If rocks of unknown age are found to have traces of [...] E. pseudoplanus, they must have a mid-Ordovician age. Such index fossils must be distinctive, be globally distributed and have a short time range to be useful. However, misleading results are produced if the index fossils turn out to have longer fossil ranges than first thought. Stratigraphy and biostratigraphy can in general provide only relative dating (A was before B), which is often sufficient for studying evolution. However, this is difficult for some time periods, because of the problems involved in matching up rocks of the same age across different continents.|$|E
500|$|The {{main goal}} of each level is to {{navigate}} through {{the stage and}} reach the gong located {{at the end of}} the level in order to transport Croc to the next, while also saving as many captured Gobbos imprisoned throughout the stage as possible. Certain stages also contain boss enemies known as [...] "Guardians" [...] that Croc must defeat in order to progress to the next stage. Various different collectibles are scattered throughout stages, including small, gray crystal orbs that act as Croc's health, and red hearts that give the player an extra life when collected. Also hidden across each stage are 6 Gobbos being held captive by the Dantini tribe that act as Croc's main objective throughout the length of the game. 5 of these Gobbos are hidden in various locations throughout the level, often collected by solving a puzzle or completing a challenge, whilst the 6th Gobbo is located in a bonus room hidden behind a set of doors that can only be reached by collecting 5 colored crystals hidden throughout the level. Rescuing every Gobbo before a boss level in each world unlocks a secret level that can be completed in order to collect <b>a</b> <b>jigsaw</b> <b>puzzle</b> piece. Subsequently, collecting every puzzle piece in the game unlocks an extra island containing more levels for the player to progress through. While collecting the Gobbos is not mandatory to completing the game, doing so is nonetheless necessary in order to face against the game's final boss and unlock the game's true ending.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the helmet}} is now {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the most important artefacts ever found on British soil, its shattered state caused it to go at first unnoticed.

The only contemporary record of the helmet's location was a circle on the excavation diagram marked [...] "nucleus of helmet remains." [...] When reconstruction of the helmet commenced years later, it would thus become [...] "a jigsaw puzzle without any sort of picture on the lid of the box," [...] not to mention <b>a</b> <b>jigsaw</b> <b>puzzle</b> missing half its pieces.|$|E

2500|$|The overall {{configuration}} of the grain is small, irregularly shaped, generally equidimensional to slightly elongated with irregular edges and does not vary significantly among the different grades (in 1992). [...] The edges of the calcite grains are deeply crenulated (irregularly and minutely notched and scalloped). Grain sizes range primarily from 0.1mm (0.00393in) to 0.6mm (0.0236in), as determined by scanning electron microscope images. [...] There are 2,000–3,000 grains to the square centimeter (0.1550 square inches). [...] Where the marble is {{in direct contact with}} the intrusive granite, the most consistent change in the marble is that it becomes extremely coarse-grained, with the grain size in the contact zone being 10mm to 20mm (0.3937–0.7874inches).

2500|$|The helmet {{was first}} reconstructed by Herbert Maryon from 1945 to 1946. A retired {{professor}} of sculpture and authority on early metalwork, Maryon was specially {{employed as a}} Technical Attaché at the British Museum on 11 November 1944. His job was to restore and conserve the finds from the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, including [...] "the real headaches – notably the crushed shield, helmet and drinking horns." [...] Maryon's work on the Sutton Hoo objects continued until 1950, of which six months [...] "full-time and continuous" [...] work was spent reconstructing the helmet. Stalled for years by World War II and still in the fragmentary state in which it had entered the war, {{by the time it}} reached Maryon's workbench the [...] "task of restoration was thus reduced to <b>a</b> <b>jigsaw</b> <b>puzzle</b> without any sort of picture on the lid of the box," [...] and, [...] "as it proved, a great many of the pieces missing." ...|$|E
2500|$|As the re-excavation at Sutton Hoo {{reached its}} {{conclusion}} and with problems {{apparent in the}} reconstructions {{of several of the}} finds, in 1968 Williams was put in charge of a team tasked with their continued conservation. In this capacity he conserved a [...] "very large number of objects," [...] chiefly among them the helmet, shield, drinking horns, bottles, tubs, and buckets. The Sutton Hoo helmet was his [...] "pièce de résistance"; [...] "the most iconic object" [...] from [...] "one of the most spectacular archaeological discoveries ever made", it had previously been restored in 1945–46 by Herbert Maryon. Taking this reconstruction to pieces, from 1970 to 1971 Williams spent eighteen months of time and a full year of work rearranging the more than 500 fragments. No photographs of the fragments in situ had been taken during the original excavation in 1939, nor were their relative positions recorded. The task for Williams [...] "was thus reduced to <b>a</b> <b>jigsaw</b> <b>puzzle</b> without any sort of picture on the lid of the box", and, [...] "as it proved, a great many of the pieces missing". Unveiled on 2 November 1971, the new reconstruction was [...] "universally acclaimed". It was published the following year by Rupert Bruce-Mitford, and posthumously by Williams in 1992.|$|E

[...] Excess civilian deaths in the Nazi occupied USSR were 13.7 million persons including 2 million Jews. There were an additional 2.6 million deaths in the interior regions of the Soviet Union. The authors maintain [...] "scope for error in this number is very wide". [...] At least 1 million perished in the wartime GULAG camps or in deportations. [...] Other deaths occurred in the wartime evacuations and due to war related malnutrition and disease in the interior.
