The box contained not only the set but also batteries, earphones, a coil of copper <b>aerial</b> <b>wire</b> and some china “egg” insulators. The 100-foot <b>aerial</b> <b>wire</b> was needed to give a strong signal. Even in 1932, when the D9150 was issued and when receiver controls had already been simplified, setting up the set would have required some skill {{and would not have}} been easy for someone with a visual handicap. Like the crystal set, all the early Magnum radios specifically manufactured for BWBF utilized the newly formalised Braille code invented by Louis Braille to label the dials on the set.|$|E

50|$|The Transmitter Berlin-Tegel was a {{broadcasting}} {{facility for}} medium wave in Berlin-Tegel, Germany It {{was built in}} 1933 and used as an <b>aerial</b> <b>wire</b> hung up in a 165 metre high tower of wood framework. In 1940, {{the height of the}} tower was reduced to 86 metres. On December 16, 1948 the tower (and a guyed mast under construction, intended to replace the tower) was bombed under orders of the French Commander (Jean Ganeval) at the time, because of concerns of endangering the air traffic of the nearby Berlin-Tegel airport, which was under construction at the time.The transmitters were moved to Koenigs Wusterhausen and installed there. Nevertheless, the transmitter building is still standing.|$|E
50|$|The liaison pilot held an {{aviation}} rating restricting {{him to the}} operation of small, low-powered aircraft; he was usually the graduate of a special Training Command course, briefer than that for a standard pilot. As members of a unit, liaison pilots had to fly formations and execute desired missions in support of ground forces. These included such activities as limited reconnaissance, courier service, <b>aerial</b> <b>wire</b> laying, artillery adjustment, and air evacuation. An exception were the Air Commando liaison pilots of the 1st, 2d and 3d Air Commando Groups that were deployed to the CBI and to the Philippines. These pilots were specially trained by Third Air Force for combat maneuvers due to their unique missions.|$|E
50|$|The {{radio was}} built by Captain George Parker, Corporal John (Jack) Sargent, Corporal John Donovan, Signaller Max (Joe) Loveless and Signalman Keith Richards. In civil life, Loveless had been a {{technician}} with 7ZL, a radio station in Hobart. The signallers built the radio using salvaged equipment, including the power pack from a Dutch transmitter, 60ft of <b>aerial</b> <b>wire,</b> a broken commercial medium-wave receiving set, and a transmitter from a broken 109 set. To power the equipment, a generator, taken from an old car, charged the batteries. The generator was operated by four natives turning handles attached to a four-foot diameter wheel, which drove a smaller 18-inch wheel connected by a rope loop. The smaller wheel ran the generator, which charged the batteries.|$|E
50|$|From 1934 to 1949 it used as {{transmission}} <b>aerial</b> a <b>wire</b> hung up in a {{tower of}} wood. This tower had until 1941 a height of 145 metres. In 1941 its height was reduced to 84.5 metres and in 1949 it was demolished.|$|R
50|$|The tower {{has been}} used for making radio {{transmissions}} {{since the beginning of the}} 20th century. Until the 1950s, sets of <b>aerial</b> <b>wires</b> ran from the cupola to anchors on the Avenue de Suffren and Champ de Mars. These were connected to longwave transmitters in small bunkers. In 1909, a permanent underground radio centre was built near the south pillar, which still exists today. On 20 November 1913, the Paris Observatory, using the Eiffel Tower as an aerial, exchanged wireless signals with the United States Naval Observatory, which used an aerial in Arlington, Virginia. The object of the transmissions was to measure the difference in longitude between Paris and Washington, D.C. Today, radio and digital television signals are transmitted from the Eiffel Tower.|$|R
50|$|East Germans {{successfully}} defected by {{a variety}} of methods: digging long tunnels under the Wall, waiting for favorable winds and taking a hot air balloon, sliding along <b>aerial</b> <b>wires,</b> flying ultralights and, in one instance, simply driving a sports car at full speed through the basic, initial fortifications. When a metal beam was placed at checkpoints to prevent this kind of defection, up to four people (two in the front seats and possibly two in the boot) drove under the bar in a sports car that had been modified to allow the roof and windscreen to come away when it made contact with the beam. They lay flat and kept driving forward. The East Germans then built zig-zagging roads at checkpoints. The sewer system predated the Wall, and some people escaped through the sewers, in a number of cases with assistance from the Unternehmen Reisebüro.|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, Blunt starred {{opposite}} Tom Cruise in Edge of Tomorrow, a film {{adaptation of}} the Japanese novel All You Need Is Kill, written by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. Blunt played Rita Vrataski, a Special Forces warrior tasked with training a public relations officer, played by Cruise, to defeat invading extraterrestrials. Blunt trained three months for her role, [...] "focusing on everything from weights to sprints to yoga, <b>aerial</b> <b>wire</b> work and gymnastics", and studying Krav Maga. The film was commercially successful, grossing $370,541,256, and it earned positive reviews. Many critics took note of the atypically dominating role portrayed by Blunt, and Justin Chang of Variety noted that [...] "Blunt is alert, energized and emotionally present in a none-too-taxing role." [...] For her performance, Blunt won the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in an Action Film.|$|E
5000|$|FuG 10 series: A {{family of}} {{transceivers}} for both R/T and W/T communications. The German FuG 10 panel, or rack, contained two transmitters and two receivers: One transmitter and its companion receiver operated in the MF or Longwave; 300 to 600 kHz (1,000 to 500 m) range {{and the other}} transmitter and its companion receiver operated in the HF or Shortwave range; 3 to 6 MHz (100 to 50 m). Most of the FuG 10 series used a fixed wire aerial between the fuselage and tailfin or a retractable trailing <b>aerial</b> <b>wire.</b> The FuG 10P replaced the standard E 10L longwave receiver with an EZ6 unit for a G6 direction finding set. The FuG 10ZY incorporated a fixed loop D/F aerial and a homing device for navigation to a ground station. This loop aerial, usually fitted on a small, [...] "teardrop" [...] shaped mounting, was standard equipment on most fighter aircraft from late 1943 on. Manufactured by Lorenz. Typical power was 70 watts.|$|E
5000|$|During World War II, Germany {{developed}} a hand-crank 500 kHz rescue radio, the [...] "Notsender" [...] (emergency transmitter) NS2. It used two vacuum tubes and was crystal-controlled. The radio case curved inward {{in the middle}} so that a user seated in an inflatable life boat could hold it stationary, between the legs and above the knees, while the generator handle was turned. The distress signal, in Morse code, was produced automatically as the crank handle was turned. An NS2 unit was captured by the British in 1941, who produced a copy, the Dinghy Transmitter T-1333. Britain gave a second captured unit to the United States, which produced its own copy, the SCR-578. United States Army Air Forces aircraft carried the SCR-578 on over-water operations. Named the Gibson Girl because of its hourglass shape, it was supplied with a fold-up metal frame box kite, and a balloon with a small hydrogen generator, for which the flying line was the <b>aerial</b> <b>wire.</b> Power was provided by a hand cranked generator. The transmitter component was the BC-778. The frequency was 500 kHz at 4.8 watts, giving it a range of 200 mi. Keying could be automatic SOS, or manual. Crystals were a scarce item for the U.S. {{during the war and}} the SCR-578 was not crystal-controlled.|$|E
