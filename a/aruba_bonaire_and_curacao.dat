5|$|On October 6, {{small craft}} {{warnings}} were issued for the Dutch islands of <b>Aruba,</b> <b>Bonaire,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Curaçao,</b> despite predictions that Hazel would {{pass to the}} north; these warnings were canceled a day later. After the storm had turned northward, tropical cyclone warnings were posted for Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and {{the waters of the}} Mona Passage. Small craft near Jamaica were advised to head for port ahead of the storm. The U.S. Navy completed extensive preparations at its Guantanamo Bay base, ordering about 1,000 civilians into hardened, fortified Quonset huts, flying aircraft out of the storm's path, and positioning surface ships out at sea.|$|E
500|$|On October 8, two {{crew members}} on Reconnaissance {{aircraft}} were injured due to turbulence while observing Hazel; one was severely enough injured to require hospitalisation. The ABC Islands of <b>Aruba,</b> <b>Bonaire</b> <b>and</b> <b>Curaçao,</b> located north of Venezuela, received rough winds and rains {{of up to}} [...] when the intensifying cyclone passed to the north. Flash flooding in Aruba and Curaçao destroyed a bridge and several water dams and resulted in losses of $350,000 (1954 USD). Puerto Rico suffered its worst flooding since 1899 {{as a result of}} the hurricane. Due to timely warnings, only nine people were killed: eight by drowning and one by a landslide; however, infrastructure, buildings, and agricultural areas suffered serious damage, and over 11,000 people were evacuated from flooded areas.|$|E
500|$|No {{casualties}} {{were reported in}} the Windward Islands, including Grenada, where, on October15, Joan made landfall.

Structural damage from the storm was estimated at $1.5million (1988USD). Increased moisture in Joan's wake caused persistent rainfall on the islands for several days, leading to widespread flooding. In Trinidad and Tobago, Joan {{was described as a}} [...] "minor inconvenience". Sustained winds up to 51mph (82km/h) with gusts up to 64mph (103km/h) were recorded on Grenada. Heavy rains amounted to 6in (152.4mm) in St. George's. Significant flooding was reported throughout the island, resulting in {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} in damage. [...] A rare invasion of African desert locusts in the Windward Islands were blamed on the storm.|$|E

5000|$|Until 2010 {{people from}} Bonaire competed in confederated {{football}} {{as part of}} the Netherlands Antilles national football team. After the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved as a unified political entity (a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands) on 10 October 2010, the five constituent islands took on new constitutional statuses within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Netherlands Antilles national team was succeeded by the Curaçao national football team and remained thus a CFU, CONCACAF and FIFA member, while Aruba was already a FIFA and CONCACAF member after registering their own association and leaving the Netherlands Antilles team in 1986. Sint Maarten was also already an independent member of CONCACAF. [...] Before Bonaire {{was a member of the}} CFU or CONCACAF, they competed in the ABCS Tournament, a competition between the Dutch-speaking teams of the Caribbean (<b>Aruba,</b> <b>Bonaire,</b> <b>Curaçao,</b> <b>and</b> Suriname), since its inception in 2010 and were surprise champions in 2011. Bonaire assembled a squad for a match on 28 February 2010 for a friendly against Curaçao, months before the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved. The match ended in a 4-0 victory for Curaçao. Bonaire's first match after the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved was an eventual 2-4 defeat to Suriname in the 2010 ABCS Tournament on 29 October 2010,19 days after the islands gained their new status in the Kingdom of the Netherlands.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the next}} several years, she made {{regularly}} scheduled trips between Italy, and Central and South America. In 1957, her funnel was modified yet again, by adding a pipe-like extension to help keep diesel fumes and smoke away from her open passenger decks, aft. In 1959 she was withdrawn from the trans-Atlantic trade and transformed into an all first class cruise ship, operating out of Genoa. An important part of her transformation was the addition of air conditioning throughout the 45-year-old vessel. As a one-class cruise ship, her number of passenger berths was reduced to 552, and all her passenger cabins were fitted with private baths. In addition, her original main mast was removed and a swimming pool installed in her aft-most cargo hold. Then, she was based in Miami {{during the winter months}} and marketed as the [...] "New M/S FRANCA C Happy-Go-Luxury Cruise to the West Indies". During the summer months, she returned to Europe to participate in the Mediterranean cruise trade. During the mid-1960s, she twice returned to her birthplace at Newport News for dry docking, underwater repair work and below waterline repainting. Franca C continued cruising until 1970. By then the ship was 56 years old, and her owners had begun to think seriously about taking her out of service and selling her for scrap. But her all-riveted hull was still in excellent condition and her first diesel engine had been replaced just a few years previously with a newer and larger diesel engine rated at 8,100 Shaft Horse Power. [...] A decision was made to keep Franca C in service, and during a brief overhaul many of her passenger spaces were refurbished internally. On 4 February 1971, she began a series of 14-day cruises in the Mediterranean. In 1974 she returned to the Caribbean and made a series of three and four-day cruises to <b>Aruba,</b> <b>Bonaire,</b> <b>Curacao</b> <b>and</b> Margarita. Franca C returned to Europe {{at the conclusion of the}} 1977 Mediterranean cruise season and her owners once again contemplated ending her career. Most ocean-going vessels remain in service for 30 to 40 years. At age 63, it was logically assumed by most maritime observers that she would be scrapped. However, certain passengers on the ship's very last cruise had other plans for the ship.|$|R
