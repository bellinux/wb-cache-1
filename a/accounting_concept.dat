A similar five part test was given after a five week Sybiz section of lectures and workshop and an assignment.

There was a significant improvement in their overall performance in an <b>accounting</b> <b>concepts</b> test and particularly in their understanding of internal controls.

It is this difference which is surprising and which makes these preliminary results interesting, despite the lack of controls.

The relevant historical economic, political, and social environment, as well as modern-day historians’ opinions and interpretations, are shown to interact with the use made and significance of <b>accounting</b> <b>concepts,</b> such as wealth, profit, assets and capital, in the selected convict’s transfigurement from an individual of the ‘criminal class’ to wealthy, well respected landholder.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} political ideology and accounting change covering the transition from Maoism to Dengism in China. Under Mao, the ideological principles of class struggle primacy, central planning, and public ownership were mobilized to construct a class view of accounting according to which Western <b>accounting</b> <b>concepts</b> were prohibited because they were considered a tool of capitalist exploitation. Under Deng, the new ideological principles of economic development primacy, marketization, and mixed-ownership {{paved the way for}} a different view of accounting to emerge. Accounting was re-presented as a science and a neutral technology with no national boundaries, and the adoption of what were deemed Western <b>accounting</b> <b>concepts,</b> such as conservatism, was encouraged. In both eras, accounting was construed as a malleable object shaped by the force of the dominant political discourse.

5000|$|Net {{output is}} an <b>accounting</b> <b>concept</b> used in {{national}} accounts {{such as the}} United Nations System of National Accounts (UNSNA) and the NIPAs, and sometimes in corporate or government accounts. The concept was originally invented to measure the total net addition to a country's stock of wealth created by production during an accounting interval. The concept of net output is basically [...] "gross revenue from production less the value {{of goods and services}} used up in that production". The idea is that if one deducts intermediate expenditures from the annual flow of income generated by production, one obtains a measure of the net new value in the new products created.|$|E
50|$|Deferred {{financing}} costs or debt issuance costs is an <b>accounting</b> <b>concept</b> meaning {{costs associated with}} issuing debt (loans and bonds), such as various fees and commissions paid to investment banks, law firms, auditors, regulators, and so on. Since these payments do not generate future benefits, they are treated as a contra debt account. The costs are capitalized, reflected in the balance sheet as a contra long-term liability, and amortized using the imputed interest method or over the finite life of the underlying debt instrument, if below de minimus. The unamortized amounts {{are included in the}} long-term debt, as a reduction of the total debt (hence contra debt) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Early debt repayment results in expensing these costs.|$|E
5000|$|Secondly, capital {{formation}} {{may be used}} synonymously {{with the notion of}} capital accumulation {{in the sense of a}} reinvestment of profits into capital assets. But [...] "capital accumulation" [...] is not normally an <b>accounting</b> <b>concept</b> in modern accounts (although it is sometimes used by the IMF and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development), and contains the ambiguity that an amassment of wealth could occur either through a redistribution of capital assets from one person or institution to another, or through a net addition to the total stock of capital in existence. As regards capital accumulation, it can flourish, so that some people become wealthier, although society as a whole becomes poorer, and the net {{capital formation}} decreases. In other words, the gain could be a net total gain, or a gain at the expense of loss by others that cancels out (or more than cancels out) the gain in aggregate.|$|E

40|$|This study {{tries to}} {{document}} and review the ideological-environmental factors surrounding the conventional <b>accounting</b> <b>concepts</b> in the Western, {{with reference to}} the US, UK and the IASC's conceptual framework, and to examine the influence of such factors on <b>accounting</b> <b>concepts.</b> It is found that the conventional <b>accounting</b> <b>concepts</b> find their justification from the Western ideological-environmental system, including ideological, political, economic, legal, social, and cultural systems. Therefore, it is argued that the conventional accounting system would not be suitable for a different ideological-environmental system, such as an Islamic or Indonesian system. The study then examines ideological-environmental systems and concepts according to Islamic teaching (the Shari'ah) and according to the Indonesian ideology of Pancasila. Examining the conventional <b>accounting</b> <b>concepts</b> from the Islamic point of view, it is found {{that it is difficult to}} justify the adoption of the conventional <b>accounting</b> <b>concepts.</b> The study then suggests <b>accounting</b> <b>concepts</b> which better reflect Islamic values. The study also reveals that the environmental system and concepts according to Pancasila ideology are closer to the Islamic system and concepts, rather than to the Western ideological system and concepts. Therefore, it is suggested that Indonesia should reconsider the adoption of the Western (i. e. IASC) accounting system as the ideological logic underlying it is not appropriate in the Indonesian context. For this reason, and the increased demand for 'Islamic' accounting due to the blossoming of Islamic banks, financial institutions and insurance (takafol) as a result of the re-assertion of Islam in the political, economic and social spheres in Muslim societies, it is suggested that the development of accounting standards and knowledge in Indonesia be directed to the adoption of an 'Islamic' accounting system. A small survey has been conducted to find out the perceptions of Muslim 'accounting lecturers', as they are so far the main actors in the Indonesian accounting standards development, regarding the above issues. It was revealed that most of them believed that the accounting system is strongly influenced by its surrounding ideological-environmental systems. Most of them also believed that an Islamic ideological system and concepts would be significantly different from the Western ideological system and concepts, so that 'Islamic' accounting would also be different from the Western conventional <b>accounting</b> system and <b>concepts.</b> However, contrary to the belief that the Indonesian ideological systems and concepts are different from the Western, most of them still believed that the IASC's <b>accounting</b> <b>concepts</b> are acceptable. Recommendations are proposed to the authorities responsible for accounting education and accounting standards setters in order to increase the awareness among academicians, policy makers, and the society as a whole regarding the importance of having an accounting system which reflects the national ideology and philosophy...|$|R

Accounting studies have long sought to establish foundations (theory) of measurement in accounting without success.

The measurement of attributes of social science phenomena does not give rise to a natural concatenation operation, which is pivotal to invoking a theoretical concept of an absolute continuous quantity that forms the basis of the classical theory of measurement. As a result, this study suggests criteria whose development might eventually lead to the construction of representational measurements in accounting. [URL]...|$|E
