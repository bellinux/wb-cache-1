25|$|Between {{the events}} of the two books, quite a bit has happened. Lorena, lover of Gus McCrae, has left Clara and married Pea Eye Parker, of the former Hat Creek Outfit. They have several children, and own a farm in the Texas Panhandle. Pea Eye is {{thoroughly}} devoted to Lorena, and Lorena has learned to reciprocate and become almost equally attached to Pea Eye. Lorena teaches in a nearby schoolhouse. The cattle ranch (set up by the Hat Creek outfit in Montana) has collapsed. Newt is dead, fallen on by the Hell Bitch. Call has finally admitted to himself that Newt was his son. July Johnson is dead, and Clara lives alone. Call has gone back to being a Ranger and a gun-for-hire. Trains have greatly expanded the reach of civilization and have pushed back the frontier. The American West is no longer rough and tumble and Captain Woodrow F. Call has become a relic, albeit a greatly respected one. Nineteen-year-old Joey Garza and his deadly German rifle (capable of killing a man at a distance of half a mile) are not <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> law and order close the book on the Wild West just yet.|$|E
500|$|Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times gave an {{unfavorable}} review. Although sex in popular music {{is considered a}} standard concept, Willman states the only reason the album would cause a reaction is because of Jackson's well-known conservative nature. He comments: [...] "So be it. Jackson's first album in four years is destined for a long ride at No. 1, not because it's any great piece of work, but largely for its aphrodisiacal aspirations." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "f musical variety and daring lyrics were all that mattered, Janet would make the grade. But the album {{has a lot to}} prove. It is the first delivery under her $40 million contract with Virgin, and its title—which translates as 'Janet, period'—is meant as a declaration of independence from her oddball siblings... She still sounds like a young woman from a male-dominated family who is searching for her identity and voice. Mostly, though, Janet sounds like a mess—period." [...] David Sinclair of The Times wrote: [...] "In the steamy, post-Madonna climate of the 1990s, Jackson is not <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> thoughts of love {{get in the way of}} the mechanics of lust, and like many of her superstar contemporaries she tends to confuse sex with soul." ...|$|E

But, Dragna wasn't <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Cohen inherit Siegel's empire without a fight and after a blockade made by Cohen, [...] "The Battle of Sunset Strip" [...] began. Dragna started to move in on Cohen's territory and killing Cohen's associates and even made numerous attempts on Cohen's life too. Cohen hired former U.S. Marine Johnny Stompanato as his bodyguard until {{he was killed by}} Lana Turner's daughter.|$|E

Because government response was slow, {{students at the}} University of Tehran took {{matters into their own}} hands. After gathering supplies, the students organized an effort to dispatch medical students and interns {{to the site of the}} disaster. Their teams were however blocked by Iranian National Guard members who had been commanded to kill any civilians who tried to help victims; writer Marcello di Cintio cites in Poets and Pahlevans: A Journey into the Heart of Iran that the [...] "Shah was not <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> a crowd of students draw attention to his inept relief efforts".|$|E
2500|$|People {{close to}} Zahau {{expressed}} {{doubt that she}} would have committed suicide. Zahau's elder sister {{said in an interview that}} [...] "I still believe my sister didn't take her life", and in a written statement on behalf of the family wrote that [...] "Rebecca valued her life and lived her life to its fullest. Rebecca loved God, her family and life." [...] Her younger sister commented more strongly by e-mail, [...] "Becky did not commit suicide. My sister was murdered." [...] Her former trainer also stated that [...] "She was always happy [...] always smiling when she came in. I didn't see a problem or anything like that." [...] Family members disputed police characterizations of Zahau as depressed, describing her instead that as a happy person. Furthermore, they state that Zahau believed as a Christian that suicide was wrong. After the suicide ruling, Neil Nalepa was quoted as stating, [...] "I would not believe Rebecca would commit suicide. It’s out of character." [...] However, Sheriff Bill Gore, who investigated the death, stated of the family's reluctance to accept the suicide ruling, [...] "We laid out the case extensively to them in Missouri to answer their questions, and it’s unfortunate she can't accept the results." [...] On September 7, the family launched a website [...] seeking donations to fund their own investigation into Zahau's death. The site states: [...] "It was obvious that the Sheriff’s Department had worked too hard to paint this picture of suicide and they were not <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the Zahaus ruin it." [...] In late September, they continued to demand that the case be re-opened.|$|E

60|$|Cora {{came out}} of the house and stood looking on, while Mose {{tightened}} the cinch again, and grasping the pommel with both hands put his toe in the stirrup. The pinto leaped away sidewise, swift as a cat, but before he could fairly get into motion Mose was astride, with both feet in the stirrups. With a series of savage sidewise bounds, the horse made off at a tearing pace, thrusting his head upon the bit in the hope to jerk his rider out of his seat. Failing of this he began to leap like a sheep. Just as he was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> up on this Mose sank the rowels into him with a wild yell, and hotly lashed him from side to side with the end of his rope. For a few rods the horse continued to leap with stiffened legs and upraised back, then abandoned all tricks and ran up the hill like a scared antelope.|$|E

6000|$|As {{the captain}} made this last remark, his quick eye {{saw that the}} wind had hauled so far round to the westward, as to {{supersede}} the necessity of tacking, {{and that they were}} actually going eight knots in a direct line from Portsmouth. Casting an eye behind him, he perceived that the cutter had given up the chase, and was returning towards the distant roads. Under circumstances so discouraging, the attorney, who began to be alarmed for his boat, which was flying along on the water, towed by the ship, prepared to take his leave; for he was fully aware that he had no power to compel the other to heave-to his ship, to enable him to get out of her. Luckily the water was still tolerably smooth, and with fear and trembling, Mr. Seal succeeded in blundering into the boat; not, however, until the watermen had warned him of their intention to hold on no longer.
