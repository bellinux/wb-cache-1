Publishers Weekly said the art [...] "takes what should be a self-evidently ludicrous proposition and somehow imbues it with plausibility". Jeff VanderMeer agreed, describing the art as detailed but never cluttered, adding realism to the plot. Reviewer Christopher <b>Allen</b> <b>said</b> Alanguilan's [...] "inking gifts [...] on display with lots of rural texture."

[...] In the episode, this was shown by O'Brien releasing Tosk, but originally, during the teaser segment at the beginning, it was intended to show dabo girl Miss Sarda [...] propositioning Commander Sisko. [...] "We had long conversations on that and ultimately came down on the conservative side, but we'd never even had that kind of conference on TNG", Allen explained. Executive producer Michael Piller wrote the episode with writer Jill Sherman Donner, who had previous credits on television shows such as Magnum P.I.|$|E

500|$|However, {{the show}} was later praised by other comedians of the time. In 1988, Steve <b>Allen</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "when judged in {{relation}} to other radio comedy scripts of the early 30s, they hold up very well indeed and are, in fact, superior to the material that was produced for the Eddie Cantor, Rudy Vallee, Joe Penner school. The rapid-fire jokes [...] run the gamut from delightful to embarrassing." [...] George Burns also found it [...] "funny". Modern reviews of Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel have also been positive. The New York Times Herbert Mitgang described it as [...] "one of the funniest [...] radio shows of the early 1930s", adding that [...] "the radio dialogue was so witty and outrageous, [...] innocent form of original comedy – as well as serious drama". Rob White of the British Film Institute said the show [...] "glitter with a thousand-and-one sockeroos." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of the single, in an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, <b>Allen</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It took a while, but it’s done really incredible. It exceeded all my expectations anyway. To be honest, I was a little worried when it first came out and it wasn’t doing great. But I think it’s just about working hard and getting people to hear the song, and then everyone started believing in it a little bit more. I remember getting a text from Keith Urban saying 'I’m not gonna lie: The first time I heard that song I wasn’t crazy about it. But after a couple listens, I really, really like it.' And I mean, I think that’s how everybody felt about the song. And I think that’s a testament to a good song. You don’t have to love ‘em the first time you hear ‘em. It grew on people." ...|$|E
500|$|Johansson is {{described}} as a sex symbol by the media, which considers her lips, green eyes, and voice among her trademarks. The Sydney Morning Herald describes Johansson as [...] "the embodiment of male fantasy". During the filming of Match Point, director Woody <b>Allen</b> <b>said</b> he found it [...] "very hard to be extra witty around a sexually overwhelming, beautiful young woman who is wittier than you are". In 2014, New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane wrote that [...] "she is evidently, and profitably, aware of her sultriness, and of how much, down to the last inch, it contributes to the contours of her reputation." [...] Regardless, Johansson dislikes being [...] "super-sexualised" [...] as [...] "the new Marilyn Monroe" [...] and [...] "always be an object of desire. Because it doesn't last." [...] Johansson's sex appeal also cost her the lead role in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) as its director David Fincher thought she was [...] "too sexy" [...] for the part.|$|E
5|$|Defense {{accounts}} contradicted {{the testimony}} of Behan, Claiborne and <b>Allen,</b> who all <b>said</b> that a man had fired a nickel-plated pistol first. Claiborne and <b>Allen</b> both <b>said</b> it was Holliday. Virgil, Wyatt and other witnesses testified that Holliday was carrying a shotgun. (Morgan remained bedridden throughout the trial and did not testify.) The prosecution's scenario would have required Holliday to fire with his pistol first, switch to the shotgun to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch back again to his pistol to continue firing.|$|R

500|$|Randall William Cook, an {{animator}} {{who worked}} with Allen on the horror film The Crater Lake Monster (1977), provided uncredited animation work on Laserblast. Sculptor Jon Berg, who built the alien creature puppets based on Allen's design, was also uncredited for his work. <b>Allen</b> <b>said</b> in a 1993 article that he and Berg created more shots in the film [...] "than originally bargained for". Special effects were assisted by Harry Woolman, and laser effects were provided by Paul Gentry. Greg Jein, the special effects model-maker who also worked on The Crater Lake Monster, designed and built the spacecraft featured in Laserblast. Jein had recently completed {{his work on the}} Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) when Allen approached him to work on Laserblast, which was the first time Jein designed a project himself. He prepared several concept sketches and, after one was selected, he constructed the [...] in two weeks.

[...] "Foreign Minister Khar and I acknowledged the mistakes {{that resulted in the}} loss of Pakistani military lives," [...] Clinton said in a statement. [...] "We are sorry for the losses suffered by the Pakistani military. We are committed to working closely with Pakistan and Afghanistan to prevent this from ever happening again." [...] US Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta said in a separate statement that the US [...] "remains committed to improving our partnership with Pakistan and to working closely together as our two nations confront common security challenges in the region", US General John R. <b>Allen</b> <b>said</b> in a statement that the agreement is [...] "a demonstration of Pakistan's desire to help secure a brighter future for both Afghanistan and the region at large."

500|$|Several {{references}} {{in the film}} to Allen's own life have invited speculation that it is autobiographical. Both Alvy and Allen were comedians. His birthday appears on the blackboard in a school scene; certain features of his childhood are found in Alvy Singer's; Allen went to New York University and so did Alvy. Diane Keaton's real surname is [...] "Hall" [...] and [...] "Annie" [...] was her nickname, and she and Allen were once romantically involved. However, Allen is quick to dispel these suggestions. [...] "The stuff that people insist is autobiographical is almost invariably not," [...] <b>Allen</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "It's so exaggerated that it's virtually meaningless to the people upon whom these little nuances are based. People got it into their heads that Annie Hall was autobiographical, and I couldn't convince them it wasn't". Contrary to various interviewers and commentators, he says, Alvy is not the character that is closest to himself; he identified more with the mother (Eve, played by Geraldine Page) in his next film, Interiors. Despite this, Keaton has stated {{that the relationship between}} Alvy and Annie was partly based on her relationship with the director.|$|E

500|$|Laserblast was {{directed}} by Michael Rae, marking his only directorial credit. [...] Filming took place over three weekends and was made [...] "for virtually no money", according to producer Band. The makeup effects in the film, including the gradual discoloration and degeneration of Kim Milford, were handled by makeup artist Steve Neill, who had previously worked with Band on the science fiction film End of the World (1977). Neill makes a cameo appearance in Laserblast as the mutated person killed by the aliens in the opening scene. Neill introduced Band to David W. Allen, the film animator who created the stop motion alien creatures in Laserblast. When Band and Neill met, the former was working full-time on his fantasy film The Primevals, which was ultimately never completed. Band had developed an interest and familiarity with animation, particularly the works of Ray Harryhausen, and wanted Allen to animate the reptilian creatures for his film. [...] Although eager to work on The Primevals, <b>Allen</b> <b>said</b> he was not yet [...] "sufficiently mature professionally" [...] to undertake a project of that size, and he felt Laserblast was [...] "something that was more manageable". Band and Allen {{would go on to}} work together on several other films and projects over the next 20 years.|$|E
500|$|Several {{well-known}} {{directors have}} praised City Lights. Orson Welles {{said it was}} his favorite film. In a 1963 interview in the American magazine Cinema, Stanley Kubrick rated City Lights as fifth among his top ten films. In 1972, the renowned Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky placed City Lights as fifth among his top ten and said of Chaplin, [...] "He {{is the only person}} to have gone down into cinematic history without any shadow of a doubt. The films he left behind can never grow old." [...] George Bernard Shaw called Chaplin [...] "the only genius {{to come out of the}} movie industry". Celebrated Italian director Federico Fellini often praised this film, and his Nights of Cabiria refers to it. In the 2003 documentary Charlie: The Life and Art of Charles Chaplin, Woody <b>Allen</b> <b>said</b> it was Chaplin's best picture. Allen is said to have based the final scene of his 1979 film Manhattan on its final scene. Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance has summarized all the best criticism and all the notable filmmakers who have singled out City Lights as their favorite Chaplin film throughout the decades in the Criterion Collection audio commentary track for the film. Vance has written that among all the praise afforded the film can be added that [...] "City Lights also holds the distinction of being Chaplin's own favorite of all his films." ...|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Smile" [...] is a bubbly, mid-tempo {{tune with}} [...] "a barroom piano lick", subdued horns and a reggae beat, {{singing in a}} light falsetto, while the organ riff {{contains}} a sample of Jackie Mittoo playing keyboards on the 1960s rocksteady song [...] "Free Soul" [...] by The Soul Brothers, also written by Mittoo. He and Clement Dodd received credit on the song as co-writers. It was described to have a [...] "cod-reggae groove that smoulders like a barbecue", as a guitar and piano {{were used for the}} background music, following the notes Gm—F as its basic chord progression. It is set in the time signature of common time, having a metronome of 96 beats per minute, and is played in the key of F major. Lyrically, the song describes Allen's satisfaction in her former lover's suffering, being in a vengeful mood: [...] "At worst / I feel bad for a while, / But then I just smile / I go ahead and smile," [...] thus creating a contrast between [...] "the peppy melody and brassy lyrics". The inspiration for the song came from a real life experience, when Allen broke up with her then boyfriend, Lester Lloyd, resulting in a drug overdose and hospitalization for her depression. The singer claimed [...] "I started to get depressed and anyone who suffers from depression knows that it can soon get so bad that you can't get out of bed. It was then that I checked into the Priory. That was really tough as I was an emotional mess. [...] The lyrics are definitely bitter-sweet". <b>Allen</b> <b>said</b> she later regretted the direct approach of her lyrics: I'm now less inclined to do that, because everything that I do say gets repeated in a way that I haven't said it, or taken out of context and spun in some negative way — and it makes me really sad. I'm not, like, a negative person. I'm actually quite positive, but this industry has really made me feel angry and negative recently. I'm not enjoying it at the moment.|$|E

2500|$|The final straw for Holder, {{according}} to numerous reports, was {{the discovery of}} a previously undocumented interview with Bill Allen, the prosecution's star witness, that raised the possibility prosecutors had knowingly allowed Allen to perjure himself on the stand. [...] Allen stated that the fair market value of the repairs to Stevens's house was around $80,000—far less than the $250,000 he said it cost at trial. [...] More seriously, <b>Allen</b> <b>said</b> in the interview that he didn't recall talking to Bob Persons, a friend of Stevens, regarding the repair bill for Stevens's house. [...] This directly contradicted Allen's testimony at trial, in which he claimed Stevens asked him to give Persons a note Stevens sent him asking for a bill on the repair work. [...] At trial, <b>Allen</b> <b>said</b> Persons had told him the note shouldn't be taken seriously because [...] "Ted's just covering his ass."
