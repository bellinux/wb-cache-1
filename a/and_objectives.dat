5|$|The {{practice}} of managing design {{to achieve a}} business objective was first documented in 1907. The Deutscher Werkbund (German Work Federation) was established in Munich by twelve architects and twelve business firms as a state-sponsored effort to better compete with Great Britain and the United States by integrating traditional craft and industrial mass-production techniques. A German designer and architect, Peter Behrens, created the entire corporate identity (logotype, product design, publicity, etc.) of Allgemeine Elektrizitäts Gesellschaft (AEG), and {{is regarded as the}} first industrial designer in history. His work for AEG was the first large-scale demonstration of the viability and vitality of the Werkbund's initiatives <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> and can be considered as first contribution to design management.|$|E
30|$|What {{do these}} {{positive}} but relatively small and heterogeneous associations between <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> subjective career success measures mean? On the one hand, they mean that – albeit related – subjective <b>and</b> <b>objective</b> career successes are clearly distinct. On the other hand, they {{mean that the}} relationship between subjective <b>and</b> <b>objective</b> career success varies; hence, there are a number of moderators to be taken into account. We are not aware of any research that systematically tested such moderators. Therefore, our following empirical example will be concerned with one important variable that may moderate the relationship between subjective <b>and</b> <b>objective</b> career success, namely the employment context.|$|R

However there is no structured approach to find the willingness to pay of customers for subjective <b>and</b> <b>objective</b> attributes separately of an experience product. This research adopts categorical hybrid conjoint analysis for pricing such experiences {{in the context of}} restaurant industry. The research considers 13 attributes and 40 attribute levels under four facets. Data collected from 135 respondents in India. The unique finding of the research is that the customers have separate utility for subjective <b>and</b> <b>objective</b> attributes of a product and they are ready to pay significant premium for subjective attributes over objective attributes. It is also found that there is sufficient scope for the marketers to redesign experience product by combining different proportion of subjective <b>and</b> <b>objective</b> attributes to offer experience products.

5|$|The pre-mission {{briefing}} {{stage is}} where the player gets information on the background <b>and</b> <b>objectives,</b> and selects the ship and weapons. The choices of ships and weapons increase as the player proceeds further along the campaign. Certain missions, however, will dictate certain ships and weapons to be used. Weapons can be classified into primary weapons and secondary weapons. Primary weapons are kinetic and energy weapons, while missiles and torpedoes are classified as secondary weapons. Each weapon has its own specifications such as its rate of fire. They also inflict different damages on hulls (body of the ships) or shields (the protective energy fields surrounding the ships), or possess special effects such as shutting down specific electronic systems or propulsion.|$|E

40|$|Physical {{activity}} (PA) {{is considered}} an effective, non-pharmacological approach to improve sleep. However, the accurate measurement of PA and sleep among adolescents is fraught with challenges. Additionally, comparing the results of different studies is often difficult due to the diversity of assessment tools, analyses and data reporting procedures used. While previous reviews have considered variables that may confound this relationship, this systematic review examines the variations in measurement methods. Based on this overview, a meta-analysis was performed to assess possible influences of the various approaches on effect sizes. Twenty-one studies {{were included in the}} systematic review, of which 12 were appropriate for meta-analysis. For this, four subgroups were formed: subjective PA <b>and</b> subjective sleep, <b>objective</b> PA <b>and</b> subjective sleep, subjective PA <b>and</b> <b>objective</b> sleep, <b>and</b> <b>objective</b> PA <b>and</b> <b>objective</b> sleep. The majority of studies used subjective measures, often with unknown reliability or validity. Few studies employed objective tools to measure sleep. The results suggest that adolescents with higher subjective <b>and</b> <b>objective</b> PA are more likely to experience good sleep subjectively and objectively. More studies employing subjective <b>and</b> <b>objective</b> measures for both PA and sleep are needed. Researchers should take into account several assessment factors unique to the adolescent population...|$|R
5|$|Management in all {{business}} and organizational activities is {{the act of}} getting people together to accomplish desired goals <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> efficiently and effectively. Management comprises planning, organizing, staffing, leading or directing, and controlling an organization (a group {{of one or more}} people or entities), or effort for the purpose of accomplishing a goal. Resourcing encompasses the deployment and manipulation of human resources, financial resources, technological resources, and natural resources. Towards the end of the 20th century, business management came to consist of six separate branches, namely human resource management, operations management (or production management), strategic management, marketing management, financial management, and information technology management, which was responsible for management information systems. Although it is difficult to subdivide management into functional categories in this way, it helps in navigating the discipline of management. Design management overlaps mainly with the branches marketing management, operations management, and strategic management.|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark is a first-person shooter {{in which}} players control Carrington Institute agent Joanna Dark {{through a series}} of levels {{collected}} together into missions. The general gameplay {{is similar to that of}} its predecessor GoldenEye 007, with features such as stealth sections <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> determined by difficulty settings carried over. Players can crouch, duck, lean, and drop from most ledges, but there is no jump ability. A number of tutorials and training activities can be taken at the Carrington Institute, which acts as the game's central hub. The Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak is needed to access the game's campaign and most of the multiplayer features, although a limited subset of the Combat Simulator options are available without the device; around 35% of the game is playable without an Expansion Pak, as estimated on the game's box and Instruction Booklet.|$|E

Believing {{that there is no}} cure for their condition, Rachel seeks to kill Alma to redeem her sister's soul. The {{relationship}} between the sisters and the Greater Fiend Doku, who cursed them, serves as a plot device to drive the game forward, with Rachel occasionally needing to be rescued by Ryu. Although not a player-controlled character in Ninja Gaiden, in a few sections of the Ninja Gaiden Sigma remake she is controllable. Two other characters assist the player in the game. Ayane, a young female ninja and one of the DOA regular cast members, acts as a guide throughout Ninja Gaiden by supplying advice <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> to the player. Muramasa, a bladesmith, has shops scattered throughout the game world where players can purchase useful items and upgrades for Ryu's weapons. Muramasa also gives quests and relates back-stories and other crucial information; for example, he tells Ryu how he can obtain the item required to upgrade his Dragon Sword to its full potential. Players have the option to customize the appearance of player characters, with selectable costumes for Ryu and hairstyles for Rachel.|$|E
