5|$|Imposex has {{recently}} been detected in Laevistrombus canarium. Imposex {{is the development of}} male sex organs in female animals exposed to man-made organic tin compounds, such as tributyltin (TBT). It has negative consequences for several species of sea snails, ranging from sterility in some individuals to the extinction of entire populations. Tin compounds are biocidal <b>anti-fouling</b> agents mixed into paints to prevent marine encrustations on boats and ships. High concentrations of these compounds are commonly present in seawater near shipyards and docking areas, exposing nearby marine life to harmful effects. In a 2011 paper, Cob and colleagues found that imposex rates are high in dog conch populations near Malaysian ports; however, the researchers could not detect any cases of sterility in affected females. The authors concluded that females of L.canarium often develop a penis when seawater contains organotin compounds, but the phenomenon does not cause sterility in this species. The ability of the dog conch to survive despite imposex makes this species a suitable local bioindicator for organotin pollution.|$|E
25|$|Techniques {{of using}} pitch and copper plating as <b>anti-fouling</b> {{techniques}} {{were attributed to}} ancient seafaring nations such as the Phoenicians and Carthaginians (1500- 300BC). Wax, tar and asphaltum have been used since early times. An Aramaic record dating from 412 B.C. tells of a ship's bottom being coated {{with a mixture of}} arsenic, oil and sulphur. In Deipnosophistae, Athenaeus described the <b>anti-fouling</b> efforts taken {{in the construction of the}} great ship of Hieron of Syracuse (died 467 BC).|$|E
25|$|One {{trend of}} {{research}} {{is the study of}} the relationship between wettability and <b>anti-fouling</b> effectiveness. Another trend is the study of living organisms as the inspiration for new functional materials. An example of biomimetic antifouling research was conducted at the University of Florida into how marine animals such as dolphins and sharks are able to effectively deter biofouling on their skin. Researchers examined the nanoscale structure of sharks and designed an <b>anti-fouling</b> surface known commercially as Sharklet. Studies show that the nanoscale topologies function not only due to the reduction of sites for macrofoulers to attach, but also due to the same thermodynamic barrier that any surface with low wettability presents.|$|E
25|$|In 1708, Charles Perry {{suggested}} copper sheathing explicitly as an <b>anti-fouling</b> device but {{the first}} experiments were not made until 1761 with the sheathing of HMS Alarm, after which the bottoms and sides of several ships' keels and false keels were sheathed with copper plates.|$|E
25|$|The {{aquaculture}} {{industry is}} addressing the negative environmental impacts from its operations (see aquaculture issues). As the industry evolves, a cleaner, more sustainable aquaculture industry {{is expected to}} emerge, one that may increasingly rely on materials with <b>anti-fouling,</b> anti-corrosive, and strong structural properties, such as copper alloys.|$|E
25|$|Biocides are {{chemical}} substances that deter the microorganisms responsible for biofouling. The {{chemical substances}} {{are incorporated into}} an <b>anti-fouling</b> surface coating, typically through physical adsorption or through chemical modification of the surface. Biofouling occurs on surfaces after formation of a biofilm. The biofilm creates a surface onto which successively larger microorganisms can attach. In marine environments this buildup usually concludes with barnacle attachment. The biocides often target the microorganisms that create the initial biofilm, typically bacteria. Once dead, {{they are unable to}} spread and can detach. Other biocides are toxic to larger organisms in biofouling, such as the fungi and algae. The most commonly used biocide, and <b>anti-fouling</b> agent, is the tributyltin moiety (TBT). It is toxic to both microorganisms and larger aquatic organisms. Biocides are also added to pool water, drinking water, and liquid lines for cooling electronics to control biological growth.|$|E
25|$|A study {{released}} in April 2013 {{has shown that}} air pollution can also stunt the growth of coral reefs; researchers from Australia, Panama and the UK used coral records (between 1880 and 2000) from the western Caribbean to show the threat of factors such as coal-burning coal and volcanic eruptions. Pollutants, such as Tributyltin, a biocide released into water from in <b>anti-fouling</b> paint can be toxic to corals.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of TBT and other tin-based <b>anti-fouling</b> coatings on marine vessels {{was a major}} environmental problem. TBT {{has been shown to}} harm many marine organisms, specifically oysters and mollusks. Extremely low concentrations of tributyltin moiety (TBT) causes defective shell growth in the oyster Crassostrea gigas (at a concentration of 20ng/l) and development of male characteristics in female genitalia in the dog whelk Nucella lapillus (where gonocharacteristic change is initiated at 1ng/l).|$|E
25|$|Acute {{and chronic}} {{pollution}} events {{have been shown}} to impact southern California kelp forests, though the intensity of the impact seems to depend on both the nature of the contaminants and duration of exposure. Pollution can include sediment deposition and eutrophication from sewage, industrial byproducts and contaminants like PCBs and heavy metals (for example, copper, zinc), runoff of organophosphates from agricultural areas, <b>anti-fouling</b> chemicals used in harbors and marinas (for example, TBT and creosote) and land-based pathogens like fecal coliform bacteria.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anti-fouling</b> is {{the process}} of {{preventing}} accumulations from forming. In industrial processes, bio-dispersants can be used to control biofouling. In less controlled environments, organisms are killed or repelled with coatings using biocides, thermal treatments, or pulses of energy. Nontoxic mechanical strategies that prevent organisms from attaching include choosing a material or coating with a slippery surface, creation of an ultra-low fouling surface with the use of zwitterions, or creation of nanoscale surface topologies similar to the skin of sharks and dolphins which only offer poor anchor points.|$|E
25|$|The {{second class}} of {{non-toxic}} <b>anti-fouling</b> coatings are hydrophilic coatings. They rely on high amounts of hydration {{in order to}} increase the energetic penalty of removing water for proteins and microorganisms to attach. The most common examples of these coatings are based on highly hydrated zwitterions, such as glycine betaine and sulfobetaine. These coatings are also low-friction, but are considered by some to be superior to hydrophobic surfaces because they prevent bacteria attachment, preventing biofilm formation. These coatings are not yet commercially available and are being designed {{as part of a larger}} effort by the Office of Naval Research to develop environmentally safe biomimetic ship coatings.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two classes}} of {{non-toxic}} <b>anti-fouling</b> coatings. The most common class relies on low friction and low surface energies. Low surface energies result in hydrophobic surfaces. These coatings create a smooth surface which can prevent attachment of larger microorganisms. For example, fluoropolymers and silicone coatings are commonly used. These coatings are ecologically inert but have problems with mechanical strength and long-term stability. Specifically, after days biofilms (slime) can coat the surfaces which buries the chemical activity and allows microorganisms to attach. The current standard for these coatings is polydimethylsiloxane, or PDMS, which consists of a non-polar backbone made of repeating units of silicon and oxygen atoms. The non-polarity of PDMS allows for biomolecules to readily adsorb to its surface in order to lower interfacial energy. However, PDMS also has a low modulus of elasticity that allows {{for the release of}} fouling organisms at speeds of greater than 20 knots. The dependence of effectiveness on vessel speed prevents use of PDMS on slow-moving ships or those that spend significant amounts of time in port.|$|E
25|$|This problem however was {{resolved}} {{with the use}} of so-called self-polishing paints, in which the biocide was released at a slower rate as the seawater reacted with the surface layer of the paint. More recently, copper-based <b>anti-fouling</b> paints have been used because they are less toxic than TBT in aquatic environment, but are only effective against marine animal life, and not so much weed growth. Non-stick coatings contain no biocide, but have extremely slippery surfaces which prevents most fouling and makes it easier to clean the little fouling that does occur. Natural biocides are found on marine organisms such as coral and sponges and also prevent fouling if applied to a vessel. Creating a difference in electrical charge between the hull and sea water is a common practice in the prevention of fouling. This technology has proven to be effective, but is easily damaged and can be expensive. Finally, microscopic prickles can be added to a coating, and depending on length and distribution have shown the ability to prevent the attachment of most biofouling.|$|E
25|$|Titanium dioxide, {{particularly}} in the anatase form, exhibits photocatalytic activity under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. This photoactivity is reportedly most pronounced at the {001} planes of anatase, although the {101} planes are thermodynamically more stable and thus more prominent in most synthesised and natural anatase, as evident by the often observed tetragonal dipyramidal growth habit. Interfaces between rutile and anatase are further considered to improve photocatalytic activity by facilitating charge carrier separation and as a result, biphasic titanium dioxide is often considered to possess enhanced functionality as a photocatalyst. It {{has been reported that}} titanium dioxide, when doped with nitrogen ions or doped with metal oxide like tungsten trioxide, exhibits excitation also under visible light.

It can also oxidize oxygen or organic materials directly. Hence, in addition to its use as a pigment, titanium dioxide can be added to paints, cements, windows, tiles, or other products for its sterilizing, deodorizing and <b>anti-fouling</b> properties and is used as a hydrolysis catalyst. It is also used in dye-sensitized solar cells, which are a type of chemical solar cell (also known as a Graetzel cell).|$|E
500|$|Tourist and {{scientific}} visits to Titanic are still continuing; by April 2012, 100 {{years since the}} disaster and nearly 25 since {{the discovery of the}} wreck, around 140 people had visited. [...] On 14 April 2012 (the 100th anniversary of the ship's sinking), the wreck of the Titanic became eligible for protection under the 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage. In the same month, Robert Ballard, the wreck's discoverer, announced a plan to preserve the wreck of the Titanic by using deep-sea robots to paint the wreck with <b>anti-fouling</b> paint, to help keep the wreck in its current state for all time. The proposed plan that Ballard announced has been outlined in a documentary made to time with the Titanic's 100th sinking anniversary called Save the Titanic With Bob Ballard where Ballard himself talks about how this proposed paint job on the wreck will work. Ballard says that he proposed to robotically clean and repaint the Titanic with a colour scheme mimicking rusticles because he saw [...] "original <b>anti-fouling</b> paint on the ship's hull, which was still working even after 74 years on the seabed" [...] when he visited the Titanic in 1986.|$|E
2500|$|Before the 18th century, various <b>anti-fouling</b> {{techniques}} were used, with three main substances employed: [...] "White stuff", {{a mixture of}} train oil (Whale oil), rosin and sulfur; [...] "Black stuff", a mixture of tar and pitch; and [...] "Brown stuff", which was simply sulfur added to Black stuff. In many of these cases, {{the purpose of these}} treatments is ambiguous. There is dispute whether many of these treatments were actual <b>anti-fouling</b> techniques, or whether, when they were used in conjunction with lead and wood sheathing, they were simply intended to combat wood-boring shipworms.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the rise}} of iron hulls in the 19th century, copper {{sheathing}} {{could no longer be}} used due to its galvanic corrosive interaction with iron. <b>Anti-fouling</b> paints were tried, and in 1860, the first practical paint to gain widespread use was introduced in Liverpool and was referred to as [...] "McIness" [...] hot plastic paint. These treatments had a short service life, were expensive, and relatively ineffective by modern standards.|$|E
2500|$|Marine Biofouling is {{described}} as the undesirable buildup of microorganisms, plants, and animals on artificial surfaces immersed in water. Significant buildup of biofouling on marine vessels can be problematic. Traditionally, biocides, a chemical substance or microorganism that can control the growth of harmful organisms by chemical or biological means, are used {{in order to prevent}} marine biofouling. Biocides can be either synthetic, such as tributyltin (TBT), [...] or natural, which are derived from bacteria or plants. TBT was historically the main biocide used for <b>anti-fouling</b> coatings, but more recently TBT compounds have been considered toxic chemicals which have negative effects on human and environment, and have been banned by the International Maritime Organization. The early design of <b>anti-fouling</b> coatings consisted of the active ingredients (e.g. TBT) dispersed in the coating in which they [...] "leached" [...] into the sea water, killing any microbes or other marine life that had attached to the ship. The release rate for the biocide however tended to be uncontrolled and often rapid, leaving the coating only effective for 18 to 24 months before all the biocide leached out of the coating.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{particular}} interest since the 1980s {{has been the}} deposition of functionalized plasma polymer films. For example, functionalized films are used {{as a means of}} improving biocompatibility for biological implants6 and for producing super-hydrophobic coatings.They have also been extensively employed in biomaterials for cell attachment, protein binding and as <b>anti-fouling</b> surfaces. Through the use of low power and pressure plasma, high functional retention can be achieved which has led to substantial improvements in the biocompatibility of some products, a simple example being the development of extended wear contact lenses. Due to these successes, the huge potential of functional plasma polymers is slowly being realised by workers in previously unrelated fields such as water treatment and wound management.Emerging technologies such as nanopatterning, 3D scaffolds, micro-channel coating and microencapsulation are now also utilizing functionalized plasma polymers, areas for which traditional polymers are often unsuitable ...|$|E

He knew the famous <b>anti-fouling</b> composition; the crew had put on the last coat and, so far as her being painted went, the tug was ready for sea.

Perhaps he could find the drum that had held the paint and he began to feel about as he moved down the slip.
