In the present paper, we focus on the consequences of the nutritional interventions, in the form of nutritional supplementation and/or the consumption of bioactive plants, on host resistance to parasitism. We also consider possible synergisms between the various nutritional options for parasite control, as well as their interaction with other <b>chemical</b> and non-chemical <b>control</b> <b>measures.</b> The <b>chemical</b> <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> include the targeted, selective use of anthelmintics, which is achieved either by monitoring and treating individual animals, or by targeting specific nematode species and consequently minimising the use of anthelmintics.

We elaborate on the feasibility of their combined, simultaneous or consecutive use and conclude with suggestions for future research directions to fully explore these synergisms and their potential use for helminth control in sheep production.

40|$|Fire blight (FB), {{caused by}} Erwinia amylovora, {{is one of}} the most {{important}} pome fruit pathogens worldwide. To control this devastating disease, various chemical and biological treatments are commonly applied in Switzerland, but they fail to keep the infection at an acceptable level in years of heavy disease pressure. The Swiss authorities therefore currently allow the controlled use of the antibiotic streptomycin against FB in years that are predicted to have heavy infection periods, but only one treatment per season is permitted. Another strategy for controlling Erwinia is to breed resistant/tolerant apple cultivars. One way of accelerating the breeding process is to obtain resistant cultivars by inserting one or several major resistance genes, using genetic engineering. To date, no study summarizing the impact of different FB <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> on the environment and on human health has been performed. This study consequently aims to compare different disease-control <b>measures</b> (biological <b>control,</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>control,</b> control by antibiotics and by resistant/tolerant apple cultivars obtained through conventional or molecular breeding) applied against E. amylovora, considering different protection goals (protection of human health, environment, agricultural diversity and economic interest), with special emphasis on biosafety aspects.

5000|$|Spruce broom rust {{or yellow}} witches' broom rust is a fungal plant disease {{caused by the}} {{basidiomycete}} fungus known as Chrysomyxa arctosphyli. It occurs exclusively in North America, with the most concentrated outbreaks occurring in northern Arizona and southern Colorado on blue and Engelmann spruce, {{as well as in}} Alaska on black and white spruce. This disease alternates its life cycle between two hosts, with the spruce serving as the primary host and bearberry (also known as kinnickinnick) serving as the secondary or alternate host. The name for the disease comes from the distinctive “witches broom”, commonly yellow in color, which forms on the spruce after young needles have been infected. Management must be carried out through physical or mechanical methods, such as the pruning of brooms or the removal of the secondary host from the area, because no <b>chemical</b> <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> (e.g. fungicides) have yet been determined to be economically effective. Generally, spruce broom rust is seen as a mostly cosmetic issue, and it is very rarely the direct cause of tree death; however, research has shown a reduction in overall productivity and health of infected trees, making it an important issue for logging and timber companies.|$|R

With the ban of several <b>chemical</b> <b>control</b> <b>measures,</b> new sustainable methods are needed to mitigate Saprolegnia infections in aquaculture. Here, PhyloChip-based community analyses showed that the Pseudomonadales, particularly Pseudomonas species, represent {{one of the largest}} bacterial orders associated with salmon eggs from a commercial hatchery. Among the Pseudomonas species isolated from salmon eggs, significantly more biosurfactant producers were retrieved from healthy salmon eggs than from Saprolegnia-infected eggs. Subsequent in vivo activity bioassays showed that Pseudomonas isolate H 6 significantly reduced salmon egg mortality caused by Saprolegnia diclina. Live colony mass spectrometry showed that strain H 6 produces a viscosin-like lipopeptide surfactant. This biosurfactant inhibited growth of Saprolegnia in vitro, but no significant protection of salmon eggs against Saprolegniosis was observed. These results indicate that live inocula of aquatic Pseudomonas strains, instead of their bioactive compound, can provide new (micro) biological and sustainable means to mitigate oomycete diseases in aquaculture.

The results reported in this study were obtained from an experiment designed to determine under field conditions the rapidity of breakdown of high rates of 2, 4 -D, with and without boron additions, applied to the soil at four intervals before planting a crop. The rapidity of breakdown of three herbicides applied to the soil at four intervals before planting a crop was studied. The activity of the herbicides in the soil was determined by the effect on stand, degree of stunting, height, and yield of corn. Studies to determine the necessary time lapse between the time of chemical application and safe planting date were conducted. Soil temperatures at three depths were recorded in an attempt to establish a relationship between breakdown of herbicides, soil temperatures, and biological activity.

40|$|Ralstonia solanacearum is {{the causal}} {{agent of the}} devastating {{bacterial}} wilt disease that attacks important agricultural crops such as potato, tomato, banana, among others, causing serious yield losses. Control of R. solanacearum is difficult because of its wide range of alternate hosts, its long survival in soil, its biological and genetic variation, the lack of natural resistance sources and the insufficiency of the appropriate <b>chemical</b> <b>control</b> <b>measures.</b> Quorum sensing is the term that describes the phenomenon whereby the accumulation of molecules allows bacteria to know the number of bacteria found in the environment (population density). R. solanacearum has a quorum sensing system for the regulation of the expression of virulence genes; the molecule 3 -OH-PAME is the self-regulatory signal. The molecule ΒHPMEH hydrolyzes 3 -OH-PAME nullifying the signal of virulence, and thus, the quorum sensing communication in R. solanacearum. In order to evaluate the βhpmeh gene we designed two vectors that express this gene {{under the control of}} two different promoters. Both vectors were verified by restriction analysis and sequencing. Agroinfiltration assays were used to analyze gene expression and the effect against R. solanacearum in potato (Solanum tuberosum) leaves.

At the ICRISAT research station (Samanko, Mali), infestation by the five main species of PB (accounting for 96 % of total) was much higher on sorghum than on cotton. In the Kolokani region, CBW infestation was negligible on the Guinea loose-panicled sorghum cultivar Bibalawili, while it was significant on both compact-panicled PB susceptible ICSH 89002 and PB resistant Malisor 84 - 7. At Samanko, Jatropha oil application on sorghum panicles showed some effect on PB when damage level was high, better than Jatropha and neem aqueous extracts. However, it did not compete with pyrethroid protection level. PE contact toxicity on CBW larvae was too low to determine a LC 50.

There are no obvious eco-climatic factors limiting the potential establishment and spread of the pathogens in the risk assessment area. The pathogens can spread over short distances by ascospores that are dispersed primarily by wind and secondarily by rain. Spread of Atropellis spp. over long distances may occur by means of movement of infected host plants for planting (especially asymptomatic), cut branches, and wood or isolated bark. Control methods used against Atropellis spp. include cultural practices and sanitary <b>measures.</b> No <b>chemical</b> <b>control</b> <b>measures,</b> resistant host genotypes or biological <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> exist. Potential consequences of the damage caused by Atropellis spp. include malformation of the trees resulting in lower wood quality or tree marketability...|$|R
30|$|The holistic, multi-pronged {{modes of}} action {{employed}} by biopesticides {{may have the}} additional benefit of delaying the development of pest resistance. Resistance to <b>chemical</b> pest <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> has been a challenge for decades (reviewed in Chandler et al. and Hollomon [67],[68]). The use of synthetic pesticides with different modes of action is one tool for dealing with this problem [68]. While resistance to biopesticides remains relatively unstudied to date due to an infrequent occurrence, {{it could be a}} productive area for future research. Even when or if pests develop resistance to biopesticides, the fact that many biopesticides draw on modes of action distinct from synthetic pesticides (reviewed in the case of bioherbicides by Duke and Dayan [69]) would facilitate their use in integrated pest management in conjunction with synthetic pesticides.|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>chemical</b> <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> {{to reduce}} the impact of {{parasite}} and pest species has frequently resulted {{in the development of}} resistance. Thus, resistance management has become a key concern in human and veterinary medicine, and in agricultural production. Although it is known that factors such as gene flow between susceptible and resistant populations, drug type, application methods, and costs of resistance can affect the rate of resistance evolution, less is known about the impacts of density-dependent eco-evolutionary processes that could be altered by drug-induced mortality. The overall aim of this thesis was to take an experimental evolution approach to assess how life history traits respond to drug selection, using a free-living dioecious worm (Caenorhabditis remanei) as a model. In Chapter 2, I defined the relationship between C. remanei survival and Ivermectin dose over a range of concentrations, in order to control the intensity of selection used in the selection experiment described in Chapter 4. The dose-response data were also used to appraise curve-fitting methods, using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) model selection to compare a series of nonlinear models. The type of model fitted to the dose response data had a significant effect on the estimates of LD 50 and LD 99, suggesting that failure to fit an appropriate model could give misleading estimates of resistance status. In addition, simulated data were used to establish that a potential cost of resistance could be predicted by comparing survival at the upper asymptote of dose-response curves for resistant and susceptible populations, even when differences were as low as 4...|$|R
