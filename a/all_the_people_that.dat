5|$|Scientists have {{estimated}} {{that there have been}} at least 13significant earthquakes along the Cascadia subduction zone in the last 6,000years. The most recent, the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, was recorded in the oral traditions of the First Nations people on Vancouver Island. It caused considerable tremors and a massive tsunami that traveled across the Pacific Ocean. The significant shaking associated with this earthquake demolished houses of the Cowichan Tribes on Vancouver Island and caused several landslides. Shaking due to this earthquake made it too difficult for the Cowichan people to stand, and the tremors were so lengthy that they were sickened. The tsunami created by the earthquake ultimately devastated a winter village at Pachena Bay, killing <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> lived there. The 1700 Cascadia earthquake caused near-shore subsidence, submerging marshes and forests on the coast that were later buried under more recent debris.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins in}} an {{abandoned}} warehouse, where Dean (Ackles) is attacked by the djinn that he is hunting. He suddenly finds himself {{in a world in}} which his mother (Smith) was not killed by the demon Azazel. He and his brother Sam (Jared Padalecki) were not raised to be hunters of supernatural creatures, but are no longer close, as Dean is irresponsible, disloyal, and drinks too much in this alternate reality; when a confused Dean calls him for help, Sam thinks that he is drunk. In the new reality, Dean is dating the beautiful Carmen (Michelle Borth), and Sam is at law school and engaged to Jessica (Palicki)another victim of Azazel. Although Dean enjoys his new life, a ghostly young woman seems to be haunting him and he is confronted by an image of corpses in his closet. He realizes that <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> he and Sam had saved as hunters are now dead, that he and Sam have a distant and somewhat adversarial relationship. After visiting the grave of his father John, who died the previous year of a stroke, Dean decides that he must give up his new-found happiness to save them.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the very}} large fault area, the Cascadia {{subduction}} zone can produce large earthquakes of magnitude 7.0or greater. The interface between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates remains locked for periods of roughly 500years. During these periods, stress builds up on the interface between the plates and causes uplift of the North American margin. When the plate finally slips, the 500years of stored energy are released in a massive earthquake.

500|$|Before naming James to the 2008 Olympic team, Team USA {{managing}} director Jerry Colangelo and coach Mike Krzyzewski gave James an ultimatum {{to improve his}} attitude, and he heeded their advice. At the FIBA Americas Championship 2007, he averaged 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game, including a 31-point performance against Argentina in the championship game, the most ever by an American in an Olympic qualifier. Team USA went 10–0, winning the gold medal and qualifying for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China. James credited the team's attitude and experience for their improvement, saying: [...] "I don't think we understood {{what it meant to}} put on a USA uniform and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> we were representing in 2004.

500|$|Wiesenthal {{worked for}} the American Office of Strategic Services for a year, and {{continued}} to collect information on both victims and perpetrators of the Holocaust. He assisted the Berihah, an underground organisation that smuggled Jewish survivors into the British Mandate for Palestine. Wiesenthal helped arrange for forged papers, food supplies, transportation, and so on. In February 1947, he and 30 other volunteers founded the Jewish Documentation Center in Linz to gather information for future war crimes trials. They collected 3,289 depositions from concentration camp survivors still living in Europe. However, as the US and the Soviet Union lost interest in conducting further trials, a similar group headed by Tuviah Friedman in Vienna closed its office in 1952, and Wiesenthal's closed in 1954. Almost all of the documentation collected at both centres was forwarded to the Yad Vashem archives in Israel. Wiesenthal, employed full-time by two Jewish welfare agencies, continued his work with refugees. As {{it became clear that}} the former Allies were no longer interested in pursuing the work of bringing Nazi war criminals to justice, Wiesenthal persisted, believing the survivors were obligated to take on the task.

Newsweek's review called it a [...] "573-page primal scream", while one Hollywood producer said it was [...] "the longest suicide note in history". In the 2003 documentary version of Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, based on Peter Biskind's 1998 anecdotal history of New Hollywood, Richard Dreyfuss recalled his initial fury at Phillips' revelations, before more circumspectly listening to [...] "a little voice inside my head [...] 'Richard, Richard, the truth was so much worse'." [...] Despite Phillips' criticisms of Steven Spielberg in the book, Spielberg nevertheless invited her to a 1997 screening of Close Encounters of the Third Kind as a way of [...] "keeping his friends close and his enemies closer."
