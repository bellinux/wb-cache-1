5|$|Homeworld is a {{real-time}} strategy game set in space. Gameplay, {{as in most}} real-time strategy titles, {{is focused}} on gathering resources, building military forces, and using them to destroy enemy forces and <b>accomplish</b> an objective. The game includes both single-player and multiplayer modes; the single-player mode consists of one story-driven campaign, broken up into levels. In each level, the player has an objective to <b>accomplish</b> before they can end the level, though the ultimate objective of the mission can change as the level's story unfolds. Between each of the 16 levels is a hand-drawn, black-and-white cutscene with narrative voiceovers.|$|E

5000|$|If {{we have a}} {{goal that}} is {{currently}} unsatisfied, {{it will be more}} prominent in our minds than a goal that has already been <b>accomplished.</b> Thus, if a protagonist has a goal that has not yet been <b>accomplished,</b> that goal should be more accessible to those who comprehend than a goal that was just <b>accomplished</b> by the protagonist. In line with this prediction, goals yet to be <b>accomplished</b> by the protagonist were recognized more quickly than goals that were just <b>accomplished.</b> We are often able to predict people’s future actions by inferring their goals. For example, when we see a man walking over to a chair, we assume that he wants to sit, especially when he has been standing for a long time. Thus, we might generate the inference, “He is going to sit." ...|$|R
