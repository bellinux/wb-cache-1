5000|$|Without {{adequate}} contact protection, {{the occurrence}} of electric current arcing causes significant degradation of the contacts, which suffer significant and visible damage. Every time a relay transitions either from a closed to an open state (break arc) or from an open to a closed state (make arc & bounce arc), under load, an electrical arc can occur between the two contact points (electrodes) of the relay. In many situations, the break arc is more energetic and thus more destructive, in particular with resistive-type loads. However, inductive loads can cause more destructive make arcs. For example, with standard electric motors, the start-up (inrush) current tends to be {{much greater than the}} running current. This translates into enormous make arcs. [...] During an <b>arc</b> <b>event,</b> the heat energy contained in the electrical arc is very high (tens of thousands of degrees Fahrenheit), causing the metal on the contact surfaces to melt, pool and migrate with the current. The extremely high temperature of the arc cracks the surrounding gas molecules creating ozone, carbon monoxide, and other compounds. The arc energy slowly destroys the contact metal, causing some material to escape into the air as fine particulate matter. This action causes the material in the contacts to degrade quickly, resulting in device failure. This contact degradation drastically limits the overall life of a relay to a range of about 10,000 to 100,000 operations, a level far below the mechanical life of the same device, which can be in excess of 20 million operations.|$|E

Due to the large energy release, plasma is generated, pressures increase, and the plasma expands. Under these conditions the plasma becomes excited enough to liquefy metal causing physical damage to equipment and any humans in the vicinity. This thesis investigates the state of art for detection of arc flash events and investigates a method of improving detection reliability, and speed by monitoring the high frequency voltage / current patterns utilizing methods similar to arc flash circuit interrupters (AFCI). A second alternative detection approach is determined through analysis of the physics of plasma development. The current state of art is based upon light detection.

On a primary spacecraft system such as a solar array, {{there is very little}} tolerance for arcing. Motivated by these concerns, an experimental investigation was undertaken to determine arc thresholds for a high voltage (200 - 500 V) solar array in a plasma environment. The investigation was in support of a NASA program to develop a Direct Drive Hall-Effect Thruster (112 HET) system. By directly coupling the solar array to a Hall-effect thruster, the D 2 HET program seeks to reduce mass, cost and complexity commonly associated with the power processing in conventional power systems. In the investigation, multiple solar array technologies and configurations were tested. The cell samples were biased to a negative voltage, with an applied potential difference between them, to imitate possible scenarios in solar array strings that could lead to damaging arcs. The samples were tested in an environment that emulated a low-energy, HET-induced plasma. Short duration "trigger" arcs as well as long duration "sustained" arcs were generated.

The role of the PCU is to maintain the potential of the ISS to within 40 volts of the ambient plasma potential. In the event of a PCU failure, ISS structure may charge to - 160 volts with respect to the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) plasma, due to the use of high voltage photovoltaic solar arrays. Operation without a PCU will result in the charging of the oxide layers on anodized aluminum components facing into the RAM direction.

The purpose of this test program is to understand the changes and degradation of the solar array panel components, including its ESD mitigation design features in their integrated form, after multiple years (up to 15) of simulated geosynchronous space environment. These tests consist of: UV radiation, electrostatic discharge (ESD), electron/proton particle radiation, thermal cycling, and ion thruster plume exposures. The solar radiation was produced using a Mercury-Xenon lamp with wavelengths in the UV spectrum ranging from 230 to 400 nm.

We have studied the evolution of auroral structures during global and local magnetic activity to investigate the occurrence rate of auroral arcs during different levels of magnetic activity. The ground-magnetic and auroral conditions are described by the magnetometer and auroral camera data from five Magnetometers — Ionospheric radars — All-sky cameras Large Experiment stations in Finnish and Swedish Lapland. We identified substorm growth, expansion, and recovery phases from the local electrojet index (IL) in 1996 – 2007 and analyzed the auroral structures during the different phases. Auroral structures were also analyzed during different global magnetic activity levels, as described by the planetary Kp index. The distribution of auroral structures for all substorm phases and Kp levels is of similar shape. About one third of all detected structures are auroral arcs. This suggests that auroral arcs occur in all conditions as the main element of the aurora. The most arc-dominated substorm phases occur in the premidnight sector, while the least arc-dominated substorm phases {{take place in the}} dawn sector. <b>Arc</b> <b>event</b> lifetimes and expectation times calculated for different substorm phases show that the longest arc-dominated periods are found during growth phases, while the longest arc waiting times occur during expansion phases. Most of the arc events end when arcs evolve to more complex structures. This is true for all substorm phases. Based on the number of images of auroral arcs and the durations of substorm phases, we conclude that a randomly selected auroral arc most likely belongs to a substorm expansion phase. A small time delay, of the order of a minute, is observed between the magnetic signature of the substorm onset (i. e., the beginning of the negative bay) and the auroral breakup (i. e., the growth phase arc changing into a dynamic display). The magnetic onset was observed to precede the structural change in the auroral display.

The experiments {{were part of}} an effort to develop systems that would allow safe operation of Hall-Effect Thrustefls) in direct-drive mode. Arc discharges are generated when the array is biased negative with respect to the plasma. If sustained for long periods of time between adjacent solar cells, arcs may severely damage a solar array, thus significantly shortening its lifetime. Most often sustained arcs are triggered by plasma produced during short-duration discharge arcs (approximately 20 microseconds). These trigger arcs are sparked between the semiconducting cell and the covering dielectric. Both trigger and sustained (greater than 1 millisecond) arcs have been captured during the tests. Current and voltage waveforms associated with the different <b>arc</b> <b>events</b> are presented.

40|$|The {{effect of}} outgassing, venting, and {{thruster}} firing events on spacecraft system performance {{has been a}} long standing issue. Recent laboratory measurements on negatively biased high voltage solar cells at Physical Sciences Inc.

Our observations show that exposing these cells to moderate levels (10 exp - 3 torr-min) of H 2 O vapor enhances the arcing frequency, while heating to 85 C to remove water vapor significantly reduces the arc frequency. The interaction of the adhesive used to attach the cover glass to the solar cell with ambient water vapor is the key factor in determining arcing rates. Elimination of adhesive exposed to the environmental plasma reduces the arc frequency more than two orders of magnitude, and eliminates any sensitivity to H 2 O exposure.

Commonly used (pulsed) DC sputtering of ITO provides high quality transparent conductive layers and is easy to use on large area substrates. The approach of RF superimposed DC sputtering lowers the resistivity of ITO thin films in comparison to DC or pulsed-DC sputtering. Thus the film thickness required and therewith the material costs can be reduced. Furthermore the near infrared transmission of the deposited films can be enhanced. ITO was deposited using a (pulsed) RF and a (pulsed) DC plasma excitation simultaneously. With increasing RF power ratio the resistivity of ITO thin films decreases, even without additional heat exposure to the substrate. However, adding RF power to a (pulsed) DC sputtering process leads to an increase of <b>arc</b> <b>events.</b> A Pulse synchronization module (PSM), which connects the Pulse DC power generator and the RF power generator, was implemented to synchronize both pulsing patterns.
