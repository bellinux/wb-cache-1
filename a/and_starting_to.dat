5|$|During 1645 the Royalist {{military}} cause largely collapsed, and Colonel Robert Blake led a Parliamentary {{force against}} Dunster in October. In November Blake began his siege of the castle, setting up his artillery in Dunster village <b>and</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> dig tunnels to plant mines beneath the walls. The castle was briefly relieved by reinforcements in February 1646, but the siege was resumed and by April the Royalists situation was untenable– an honourable surrender was negotiated and a Parliamentary garrison installed. After {{the end of}} the Second English Civil War in 1649, however, Parliament decided to deliberately destroy, or slight, the defences of castles in key Royalist areas, including the south-west. In the case of Dunster, Thomas's son George Luttrell was able to convince the authorities to destroy only the medieval defensive walls, rather than the entire castle, leaving Dunster damaged from the recent siege but still habitable; the walls were demolished over 12 days in August 1650 by a team of 300 workmen. The only parts of the medieval walls to survive were the Great Gatehouse and the bases of the two towers in the Lower Ward.|$|E

The Australians passed the follow-on target after drinks, and shortly after this Adam Gilchrist and Michael Clarke made their half-centuries. Just as Adam Gilchrist was beginning to look dangerous <b>and</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> score quickly, Ashley Giles had him caught attempting a six. He had made 64 runs off 79 balls, and the score was 384 for 6. Shane Warne joined Clarke at the crease, and the pair negotiated through to lunch, taking the score to 417 for 6.|$|E

To prevent the King from joining loyal troops in Scania, on 13 March 1809 seven of the conspirators led by Carl Johan Adlercreutz broke into the royal apartments in the palace, seized the king, and imprisoned him and his family in Gripsholm castle; the king's uncle, Duke Charles (Karl), was thereupon persuaded to accept the leadership of a provisional government, which was proclaimed the same day; and a diet, hastily summoned, solemnly approved of the revolution.|$|E

50|$|After {{affecting}} New Caledonia, Rewa weakened into {{a tropical}} depression and moved towards the northwest {{over the next}} few days, before re-entering the Australian basin during January 10 <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> show signs of reintensification. Over the next few days the cyclone moved towards the north north-west <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> affect Papua New Guinea for the second time before it was renamed Rewa during January 13 while it recurved <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> move towards the south-west. Over the next few days the cyclone continued to move to the south-east towards the South Pacific basin, before as it peaked in intensity on January 16 as a category 5 severe tropical cyclone, Rewa turned <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> move towards the south-west. Over the next few days, the cyclone gradually weakened while it moved towards the south-west and a predicted landfall near Mackay in Queensland. However, during January 18, Rewa interacted with an upper level trough and as a result turned <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> move towards the south-east along the Queensland coast. Rewa then degenerated into an extratropical cyclone during January 20, with its remnants last noted bringing heavy rain to New Zealand on January 23.|$|R
25|$|The newly {{independent}} nation of Georgia, which also hosted several bases of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet {{when it was}} the Georgian SSR, also claimed {{a share of the}} Fleet, including 32 naval vessels formerly stationed at Georgia's Black Sea port of Poti. Not a CIS member at that time, Georgia was not, however, included in the initial negotiations in January 1992. Additionally, some low-importance bases situated in the Russian-backed breakaway autonomy of Abkhazia soon escaped any Georgian control. In 1996, Georgia resumed its demands, and the Russian refusal to allot Georgia a portion of the ex-Soviet navy became another bone of contention in the progressively deteriorating Georgian-Russian relations. This time, Ukraine endorsed Tbilisi's claims, turning over several patrol boats to the Georgian Navy <b>and</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> train Georgian crews, but was unable to include in the final fleet deal a transfer of the formerly Poti-based vessels to Georgia. Later, the rest of the Georgian share was decided to be ceded to Russia in return for diminution of debt.|$|E
25|$|At {{this stage}} as the cyclone was moving towards the {{southwest}} it posed a severe threat to Vanuatu however, during that day Susan recurved towards {{the southeast and}} subsequently spared Vanuatu a direct hit. After sparing Vanuatu a direct hit, Susan started to accelerate towards the southeast and while starting to weaken significantly passed close enough to Fiji during January 7 and 8 to cause gale force winds in Fiji's southern and western islands. While continuing to move towards the southeast, Susan started to interact with Severe Tropical Cyclone Ron during January 8 before it absorbed Ron by 0600UTC the next day <b>and</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> transition into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants of the combined systems were then monitored for another day until they were last noted on January 10, bringing an unseasonable cold snap to New Zealand. Despite sparing Vanuatu and Fiji direct hits, heavy rain and gale force winds associated with Susan {{were reported to have}} caused minor damage to several Vanuatuan and Fijian islands. These islands included Viti Levu where a possible tornado destroyed the roof of a shopping centre and the Vanuatuan island of Ambrym, where a woman died after being hit by a falling coconut tree, while gathering supplies to secure her house with.|$|E
25|$|Ben-Gal {{described}} {{the battle to}} Eitan {{and told him he}} was not sure he could hold on. Eitan asked him to hold on for another half-hour. At this point, the remaining eleven tanks of the Barak Brigade arrived, and Eitan directed them to Ben-Gal. Eitan told Ben-Gal of Ben-Hanan's force. Kahalani called Captain Emi Palant, the senior officer behind the ramps, to use a signal flag to get the tank commanders' attention and direct them to the ramp, but waving the flag got no response. Palant fired his machine gun {{at the side of the}} nearest tank to get the commander to look out, and the message was passed. He ran from tank to tank and rapped on their turrets to get their attention before returning to his own tank <b>and</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> move forward. No tank followed. Kahalani heard a sergeant from the 74th Battalion and ordered him to take his position and guard the wadi. The sergeant replied he did not have any shells left. Zamir, who was flanking his position to the south, reported a massive Syrian attack and asked for permission to move the remaining tanks to Zamir's company to a better position slightly to the south. Ben-Gal refused. Kahalani reported that he was unable to control the tanks, which kept drifting to the rear. Ben-Gal said he would try to get him more tanks. Kahalani ordered the sergeant to take his place, saying the Syrians would not try to attack if they saw his tank.|$|E

25|$|From around 1950 to 1965, {{the support}} for these {{theories}} was evenly divided, with a slight imbalance arising {{from the fact that}} the Big Bang theory could explain both the formation and the observed abundances of hydrogen and helium, whereas the Steady State could explain how they were formed, but not why they should have the observed abundances. However, the observational evidence began to support the idea that the universe evolved from a hot dense state. Objects such as quasars and radio galaxies were observed to be much more common at large distances (therefore in the distant past) than in the nearby universe, whereas the Steady State predicted that the average properties of the universe should be unchanging with time. In addition, the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964 was considered the death knell of the Steady State, although this prediction was only qualitative, and failed to predict the exact temperature of the CMB. (The key big bang prediction is the black-body spectrum of the CMB, which was not measured with high accuracy until COBE in 1990). After some reformulation, the Big Bang has been regarded as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the cosmos. Before the late 1960s, many cosmologists thought the infinitely dense and physically paradoxical singularity at the starting time of Friedmann's cosmological model could be avoided by allowing for a universe which was contracting before entering the hot dense state, <b>and</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> expand again. This was formalized as Richard Tolman's oscillating universe. In the sixties, Stephen Hawking and others demonstrated that this idea was unworkable, and the singularity is an essential feature of the physics described by Einstein's gravity. This led the majority of cosmologists to accept the notion that the universe as currently described by the physics of general relativity has a finite age. However, due to a lack of a theory of quantum gravity, there is no way to say whether the singularity is an actual origin point for the universe, or whether the physical processes that govern the regime cause the universe to be effectively eternal in character.|$|E

Iron, Newcastle coal and Scandinavian wood was brought in for use in the project. By {{the end of the year}} £184 had been spent, and work continued for several years. A licence to crenellate - a form of royal authorisation for a new castle - [...] was issued by Edward II in 1316, and a castle constable was appointed in 1319, charged with defending both the castle and the surrounding manors of Embleton and Stamford.

500|$|MacGregor {{arrived in}} the Venezuelan capital Caracas a {{fortnight}} after {{much of the city}} had been destroyed by an earthquake. With swathes of the country under the control of advancing royalist armies, the revolutionary government was losing support <b>and</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> fracture. MacGregor dropped his pretended Scottish baronetcy, reasoning that it might undermine the republican credentials he hoped to establish, but continued to style himself [...] "Sir Gregor" [...] on the basis that he was, he claimed, a knight of the Portuguese Order of Christ. He offered his services directly to Miranda in Caracas. As a former British Army officer—from the famous [...] "Die-Hards", no less—he was received with alacrity and given command of a cavalry battalion with the rank of colonel. In his first action, MacGregor and his cavalry routed a royalist force west of Maracay, between Valencia and Caracas. Subsequent engagements were less successful, but the republican leaders were still pleased with the glamour they perceived this dashing Scottish officer to give their cause.|$|E

Los Angeles Times writer Jon Caramanica said the same-sex marriage subplot only alters the show's dynamic [...] "a smidge", and mainly serves as [...] "another opportunity for misadventure for Leslie Knope".

500|$|Estimated to be 590 to 650 {{million years}} old, {{the stars were}} {{probably}} {{at the hot end}} of spectral class A during their main sequence lifetime, similar to Vega. They have now exhausted their core hydrogen and evolved off the main sequence, their outer layers expanding and cooling. Despite the giant luminosity class, the secondary component is very clearly within the Hertzsprung gap on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, still expanding and cooling towards the red giant branch, making it a subgiant in evolutionary terms. [...] The more massive primary has already passed through this stage, when it reached a maximum radius of 36 to 38 times that of the Sun. It is now a red clump star which is fusing helium to carbon and oxygen in its core, a process that has not yet begun for the less massive star. Detailed analysis shows that it is nearing the end of this stage <b>and</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> expand again which will lead it to the asymptotic giant branch. Isotope abundances/C13 ratio and C/N ratio have all declined in Capella Aa but not in Capella Ab. and spin rates confirm this evolutionary difference between the two stars. Heavy element abundances are broadly comparable to those of the Sun and the overall metallicity is slightly less than the Sun's.|$|E
