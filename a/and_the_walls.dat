5|$|Southampton's town walls {{remained}} an important defensive feature during the 15th century, the gatehouses sometimes {{being used as}} important civic facilities, including acting as the town's guildhall and housing the town's gaol. From {{the end of the}} 17th century their importance steadily declined <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were slowly demolished or adapted for other uses throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. This process continued into the early 20th century until, in the post-war years, the walls were recognised as an important historical feature of Southampton. Conservation projects have since occurred <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> are now promoted as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|A great {{portion of}} the mosque is covered with whitewash, but the drum of the dome <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> {{immediately}} beneath it are decorated with mosaics and marble. Some paintings by an Italian artist were introduced when repairs were undertaken at the mosque after an earthquake ravaged the mosque in 1927. The ceiling of the mosque was painted with funding by King Farouk of Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Angkor Wat, {{located at}} , {{is a unique}} {{combination}} of the temple mountain (the standard design for the empire's state temples) and the later plan of concentric galleries. The temple is a representation of Mount Meru, {{the home of the}} gods: the central quincunx of towers symbolises the five peaks of the mountain, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> and moat symbolise the surrounding mountain ranges and ocean. Access to the upper areas of the temple was progressively more exclusive, with the laity being admitted only to the lowest level.|$|E

5|$|In the 17th century, {{the castle}} {{was no longer}} used as a {{defensive}} building by the Swedes who now ruled the Swedish Estonian Province. In {{the course of the}} Great Northern War in 1710, Estonia fell under Russian rule <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were partially demolished at the command of the Peter I of Russia, turning the castle in effect into ruins.|$|E
5|$|The hotel's {{exterior}} façade {{was inspired}} by the Louis XII wing of the Château de Blois. Since its construction, dormers have been added and the window design has changed. The original façade {{can be seen in the}} decoration of some ground-floor windows and the portal, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> windows and corbels of this hôtel particulier are in the Gothic style.|$|E
5|$|By 1300, Southampton was a {{major port}} and a large provincial town, with a {{population}} of around 5,000. In 1338 there was a successful French attack on Southampton, burning various buildings down and damaging the castle. Edward III responded by improving the quality of the town defences, including building walls along the old ditch and bank defences, and particularly focusing on improving {{the west side of the}} town, but little work appears to have been done to improve the castle itself. By the middle of the 14th century, Southampton Castle sat alongside one and a quarter miles (2 km) of town walls, although the castle <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were kept administratively separate.|$|E

50|$|Half-models {{are used}} in wind-tunnel testing in aerodynamics, as larger scale half-models in {{constant}} pressure tunnels operate at increased Reynolds numbers closer to those of real aircraft. One trade-off is {{the interaction between the}} central part of <b>the</b> half-model <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> boundary layer. Inserting a peniche between the centre line of <b>the</b> half-model <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of <b>the</b> wind tunnel attempts to eliminate or reduce that boundary layer effect by creating distance between <b>the</b> model <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> Varying widths <b>and</b> shapes of peniches have been used; a peniche that follows the longitudinal cross section contour of the half-model is the simplest.|$|R
5|$|Initially {{built by}} Constantine the Great, the walls {{surrounded}} the new city on all sides, protecting it against attack from both sea and land. As the city grew, the famous double {{line of the}} Theodosian Walls {{was built in the}} 5th century. Although the other sections of the walls were less elaborate, when well-manned, they were almost impregnable for any medieval besieger, saving the city, and the Byzantine Empire with it, during sieges from the Avar-Sasanian coalition, Arabs, Rus', and Bulgars, among others. The advent of gunpowder siege cannons rendered the fortifications vulnerable, but cannon technology was not sufficiently advanced to capture the city on its own, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> could be repaired between reloading. Ultimately the city fell from sheer weight of numbers of the Ottoman forces on 29 May 1453 after a six-week siege.|$|E
5|$|P. schultzi, {{along with}} a large variety of spiders and insects, is often found in the dense, large webs of the diplurid Ischnothele karschi (about 15millimetres long), which are {{especially}} abundant in partly cleared secondary bush where rain forests have been cut down, and usually about one metre above the ground. A survey of one area suggested that there is about one P. schultzi per three I. karschi webs. P. schultzi {{is also found in}} its own web and those of other spiders, on tree trunks <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of buildings, and in leaf litter.|$|E
5|$|The Grey dynasty {{maintained}} their {{ownership of the}} castle, which passed into Lady Mary Grey's {{side of the family}} following a law case in 1704. The lands around the castle and the outer bailey were used for growing wheat, barley and oats, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were robbed of their stone for other building work. A small settlement, called Nova Scotia or Novia Scotia, was built {{on the site of the}} castle's harbour, possibly by Scottish immigrants. Several engravings were published of the castle in the 18th century, including a somewhat inaccurate depiction by Samuel and Nathaniel Buck in 1720, and by Francis Grose and William Hutchinson in 1773 and 1776 respectively.|$|E

5|$|The castle was {{attacked}} during the Madog ap Llywelyn revolt of 1294, the Llywelyn Bren uprising in 1316 {{and during the}} overthrow of Edward II in 1326–27. In the late 15th century, however, it fell into decline and by the 16th century the lakes had drained away <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were robbed of their stone. The Marquesses of Bute acquired the property in 1776 and under {{the third and fourth}} Marquesses extensive restoration took place. In 1950 the castle and grounds were given to the state and the water defences were re-flooded. In the 21st century, the Welsh heritage agency Cadw manages the site as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|The nave was in poorest {{condition}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were substantially rebuilt and {{the porch}} wholly replaced {{in the first}} phase in 1868-9, with Thomas Williams of Cardiff the contractor. The font was restored at this time. Traces of painted decoration were found in the nave, including a colossal St Christopher on the north wall opposite the entrance. Unfortunately this and other traces of fresco could not be saved; they were destroyed without a pictorial record of them having been made. The committee considered an oak roof for the nave, but rejected it as too costly.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} mihrab, {{uncovered in}} 1933, has a semi-dome above {{it with a}} marble column on either side. Intricate stucco decorations were a prominent feature of the mosque, with the mihrab <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> ornately decorated. The mihrab had two sets of verses from the Quran inscribed in the conch, which is still intact. The first set of verses are the three that open al-Mu’minoon:Successful indeed are the believers – who are humble in their prayers – and who avoid vain talkThe next inscription {{is made up of}} verses 162 and 163 of al-An'am:Say: Surely my prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are (all) for Allah, the Lord of the worlds – No associate has He; and this am I commanded, and I am the first of those who submit.These inscriptions are the only surviving piece of decoration that has been definitively traced to the Fatimids.|$|E

5|$|The {{surface of}} any liquid is an {{interface}} between that liquid {{and some other}} medium. The top surface of a pond, for example, is an interface between the pond water and the air. Surface tension, then, is not a property of the liquid alone, but a property of the liquid's interface with another medium. If a liquid is in a container, then besides the liquid/air interface at its top surface, {{there is also an}} interface between the liquid <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of the container. The surface tension between the liquid and air is usually different (greater than) its surface tension with the walls of a container. And where the two surfaces meet, their geometry must be such that all forces balance.|$|E
5|$|There are benches in {{the main}} aisle and confessionals in the side aisles. The confessionals {{contained}} benches until {{the closure of the}} church in 1938. After its reconstruction, the left side was reserved for women, and the right for men. Both side aisles are separated from the main aisle by pillar files, consisting of four columns and two half columns. The columns and the roof are painted in white, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> in cream. The floor is constructed from light and dark grey marble slabs in a chequered pattern.|$|E
5|$|All {{but two of}} {{the fifteen}} {{multiplayer}} maps are based on locations explored throughout the God of War series, with eight of those based on locations explored in Ascension; for example, Desert of Lost Souls is from the original God of War, Bog of the Forgotten is from God of War II, and Labyrinth of Daedalus, Forum of Hercules, and Chamber of the Flame are from God of War III. The two original maps are the Coliseum of Persia <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Walls</b> of Troy (which features the Trojan Horse). Every map features special power-ups awarded by the gods for earning points, such as the Boots of Hermes for acceleration and running attacks. Maps also have environmental obstacles or objectives to complete for more points. For example, on the Desert of Lost Souls map, the cyclops Polyphemus may attack nearby players and killing him with the Spear of Olympus will grant bonus points for that team.|$|E

5|$|In 1939 some paving <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of two unusual {{elliptical}} {{buildings were}} discovered, one atop the other. These 'elliptical' buildings were partially uncovered behind Chester's market hall, and no similar buildings {{have been found}} in other legionary fortresses. The buildings were located near the centre of the fortress and they had their own bath buildings and a range of store rooms around the outside. The presence of a second bath building is unusual because legionary fortresses generally had just one set of internal baths. Construction on the site began around AD 77 and this was confirmed by a length of lead piping, which served a central water feature or fountain, which was stamped with the name of Emperor Vespasian. The first building was a prestigious edifice made with concrete foundations and finely dressed stonework, and was probably the finest building in the entire fortress. Technically speaking it was not elliptical, but arcuate, with the central hall being formed from two intersecting arcs, and this makes it unique in the Roman Empire. Its function is unknown. There was no seating within the arcs, which precludes a theatre, and the best guess of the archaeologists was that the twelve alcoves may have contained images of the gods, with the temple being dedicated to the twelve primary gods of the Roman pantheon. Or, alternatively, the oval shape may have represented the shape of the known Roman world, but there is no supporting evidence for this.|$|E
5|$|Once {{news of the}} Ottoman {{approach}} arrived, Venice sent reinforcements to its cities along Albania; Durazzo (Durrës) {{had already}} garrisoned 3,000 men. The Scutari Fortress was also reinforced after Skanderbeg's counsel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were rebuilt. On 19 April 1466, news spread that the sultan was going to march into Avlonya (Vlorë) with an army of 100,000 men although the Ragusans reported that the number was 30,000. Ottoman forces were ready to enter the Kingdom of Naples and pressured Ferdinand to form an alliance with Mehmed. The situation was not clear in the Balkans, however, as {{it was thought that}} the Ottomans could march against Bosnia, Serbia, Dalmatia, Negroponte, or Albania. By the beginning of May, however, {{it was clear that the}} Ottomans would attack Albania because of the approach of Mehmed's troops towards Albania after the end of his campaigns in Wallachia, Karaman, and the Morea. None of the promised reinforcements from Naples and Venice arrived and Skanderbeg was thus left to fight Ottoman forces only with the league's troops.|$|E
5|$|The 19thcentury saw {{efforts to}} {{preserve}} the castle. In 1826 repairs {{were made to the}} well in the keep. At the same time a survey was carried out by A. W. N. Pugin and he excavated around the keep, investigating how it was built. He descended into the well in a bucket in an unsuccessful search for treasure. Victor Child Villiers, 7th Earl of Jersey, leased the castle to the Corporation of Rochester in 1870 for use as a public park; when it opened to the public in 1872, Rochester Castle was presented as a picturesque ruin, with trees planted in the enclosure <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> overgrown with ivy. In 1884 the Corporation bought the castle for £6,572 (equivalent to £3.4million in 2009 terms). Between 1896 and 1904, George Payne carried out repairs. In {{the first quarter of the}} century the gardens acquired a German field gun and a tank from the First World War, and a bandstand, though they were removed by 1961. Ivy was removed from the keep between 1919 and 1931 and the planting in the castles scaled back. In 1960 the origin of Boley Hill was investigated archaeologically, but the excavations failed to provide firm dating evidence.|$|E
