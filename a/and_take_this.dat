500|$|In {{the days}} leading to the programme's broadcast, the IOC Ethics Commission {{launched}} an enquiry to investigate the accusations made in the documentary. Even though the Panorama reporters clearly stated that the London bid was nowhere associated with the investigation, the bid officials made further statements claiming the team had no knowledge and involvement, hoping {{to distance themselves from}} the scandal: [...] "What I have to make clear is that London 2012 knew nothing about this—we have nothing to hide," [...] said Alan Pascoe, a London 2012 vice chairman, committing to [...] "do everything we can to co-operate [...] <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> story off the running order". Sebastian Coe, also a vice chairman at the time, reaffirmed Pascoe's words and assured [...] "London 2012 has acted properly and ethically throughout the bidding process." [...] After watching the documentary, IOC members and officials cleared London 2012 of any wrongdoing.|$|E

2500|$|Contestants {{were awarded}} $100 for each digit {{removed from the}} board. In the {{earliest}} episodes of the 1974–76 version, contestants could stop <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> money after a good roll. A bad roll with no insurance markers, or eliminating all digits except for the 1, ended the game and forfeited the money. The contestant won a car for removing eight digits, and $10,000 for all nine. The rules were soon changed to eliminate the car bonus and allow the contestant to keep the accumulated money after making a bad roll.|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{application}} process attracted little comment at the time, a controversy broke {{out after the}} ICM's plans were approved. At the commission's next meeting, on June 17, 2010, more than 600 people, some wearing Christian- or patriotic-themed clothes, turned out to protest its approval of the ICM's plans. Many said they had {{become aware of the}} plans only after they had been approved. Opponents were harshly critical both of the ICM and of Islam itself. Karen Harrell, a Murfreesboro resident, said: [...] "Everybody knows they are trying to kill us. People are really concerned about this. Somebody has to stand up <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> country back." ...|$|E

It is my aim to build on that now <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> club forward." [...] He acknowledged that he would face a battle to win over players and supporters, and that other managers had texted him to say [...] "you must be mad going there", but he declared, [...] "It's one of the top five clubs in England. It's a daunting prospect but something I couldn't turn down." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2007, Huckabee drew {{endorsements}} from a {{large number}} of religious activists, including Billy McCormack, a pastor in Shreveport, Louisiana, and a director {{and vice president of the}} Christian Coalition of America, founded in 1988 by a previous presidential candidate, Pat Robertson. He was criticized for using a bookshelf that resembled a cross in a Christmas commercial as a form of signaling to Christians, and laughed them off saying [...] "I will confess this: If you play the spot backwards, it says, 'Paul is dead. Paul is dead.'" [...] He also faced a [...] "drumbeat" [...] of questions about the role of faith in his gubernatorial administration and about past statements he made in 1998 about the U.S. being a [...] "Christian nation" [...] in which he said, [...] "I hope we answer the alarm clock <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> nation back for Christ." [...] Huckabee told NBC that his comment was not politically incorrect and was [...] "appropriate to be said to a gathering of Southern Baptists". Huckabee has credited God with some of his political success.|$|E

2500|$|One notable {{exception}} to this rule was the WrestleMania VI Ultimate Challenge title for title match between WWF Champion Hulk Hogan and the WWF Intercontinental Champion, The Ultimate Warrior. Since they were both fan favorites, Ventura took a neutral position in his commentary, even praising Hogan's display of sportsmanship {{at the end of}} the match when he handed over the WWF Championship belt to the Warrior after he lost the title, stating that Hogan was going out like a true champion. During the match, however, which was also the last match at Wrestlemania he called, Ventura did voice his pleasure when both broke the rules, at one point claiming, [...] "This is what I like. Let the two goody two-shoes throw the rule book out and get nasty." [...] Ventura's praise of Hogan's action was unusual for him, because he regularly rooted against Hogan during his matches, usually telling fellow commentator Monsoon after Hogan had won a championship match at a Wrestlemania that he might [...] "come out of retirement <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> dude out". Hogan and Ventura were at one point close friends. However, Ventura abruptly ended the friendship after he discovered, during his lawsuit against McMahon, that Hogan was the one who had told McMahon about Ventura's attempt to form a labor union in 1984. Following a dispute with McMahon over the use of his image for promoting a Sega product, McMahon—who had a contract with rival company Nintendo at the time—released Ventura from the company in August 1990.|$|E
