5000|$|The {{collapse}} {{was caused}} by a southbound semi-trailer truck from Canada hauling an oversize load to Vancouver, Washington, directly damaging sway struts and, indirectly, the compression chords in the overhead steel frame (trusswork) on the northernmost span of the bridge. The vertical clearance from the roadway to the upper <b>arched</b> <b>beam</b> in the outer lane is 14 ft, and all trucks with oversize loads are expected to travel in the inside lane where the clearance is around 17 ft. The oversize truck instead entered the bridge in the outer lane, while a second semi-truck and a BMW were passing it in the inner lane. The oversize truck had received a State oversize permit for a wide and tall load, for a height of 15 ft, and after the collapse a [...] "dented upper corner and a scrape along the upper side were visible on the 'oversize load' equipment casing being hauled on the truck." [...] The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) measured the truck's height, after the crash, to be 15 ft. A pilot car was hired to ensure the load could pass safely. The pilot car never signalled the truck driver {{that there would be a}} problem crossing the Skagit bridge and did not warn the trucker to use an inside lane.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} experimentally, theoretically, and numerically a wide-range tunability of electrothermally actuated MEMS <b>arch</b> <b>beams.</b> The beams {{are made}} of silicon and are intentionally fabricated with some curvature as in-plane shallow arches. Analytical results based on the Galerkin discretization of the Euler Bernoulli beam theory are generated and compared to the experimental data and results of a multi-physics finite-element model. A good agreement is found among all the results. The electrothermal voltage is applied between the anchors of the clamped-clamped MEMS <b>arch</b> <b>beam,</b> generating a current that passes through the MEMS <b>arch</b> <b>beam</b> and controls its axial stress caused by thermal expansion. When the electrothermal voltage increases, the compressive stress increases inside the <b>arch</b> <b>beam.</b> This leads to increase in its curvature, thereby increases the resonance frequencies of the structure. We show here that the first resonance frequency can increase up to twice its initial value. We show also that after some electro-thermal voltage load, the third resonance frequency starts to become {{more sensitive to the}} axial thermal stress, while the first resonance frequency becomes less sensitive. These results can be used as guidelines to utilize arches as wide-range tunable resonators...|$|R
40|$|Summary. This paper studies {{finite element}} methods {{for a class}} of <b>arch</b> <b>beam</b> models. For both {{standard}} and mixed methods, existence and uniqueness results are proved, optimal rates of convergence are obtained and the superconvergence property is established. Reduced integration is shown to be an efficient method for <b>arch</b> <b>beam</b> problems and selected reduced integration {{is found to be}} identical to the mixed method. The significance of the analysis is threefold. The mixed method and the reduced integration methods converge uniformly at the optimal rate with respect to the arch thickness parameter, so they are locking free. Second, mixed method and reduced integration keep the superconvergence properties of the standard method. Finally, this is the first attempt to investigate the superconvergence of finite element methods for <b>arch</b> <b>beam</b> problems.

We show that by carefully choosing the geometrical parameters and the shape of curvature, the veering phenomenon (avoided-crossing) between the first two symmetric modes can be activated. To demonstrate this concept, we study electrothermally tuned and electrostatically driven MEMS initially curved resonators. Applying electrothermal voltage heats up the beams and then increases their curvature (stiffness) and controls their resonance frequencies. While changing the electrothermal voltage, we demonstrate high frequency tunability of arc resonators compared to the cosine-configuration resonators for the first and third resonance frequencies. For arc beams, we show that the first resonance frequency increases up to twice its fundamental value and the third resonance frequency decreases until getting very close to the first resonance frequency triggering the veering phenomenon.
