40|$|Dross is the {{inevitable}} waste product {{generated by the}} world-wide primary and secondary aluminium industries. Around 3. 5 million tonnes of white dross and 0. 85 million tonnes of <b>black</b> <b>dross</b> are produced per year. Drosses are classified depending on metal content. White dross contains 40 % and <b>black</b> <b>dross</b> contains 10 % of aluminium. About half of the white dross is currently landfilled along with {{almost all of the}} <b>black</b> <b>dross,</b> and the annual cost to the UK industry of landfilling this waste is about £ 90 million per year. There is no commercially viable method of recovering the aluminium, which is potentially recyclable from these drosses, and no current conventional process has the custom-built capability to avoid their disposal to landfill. The practice of landfilling aluminium dross has raised problems for both industry and environment, because of potential leaching of heavy metals into groundwater from the landfill. The <b>black</b> <b>dross</b> has been physically and chemically characterised. The results show that the dross contains mostly metallic aluminium, aluminium nitride, alumina, sodium chloride, potassium chloride and silica with almost 50 % of the dross being a mixture of sodium chloride and potassium chloride. A counter current leaching process has been developed to recycle the salts back to the secondary furnace. The environmental impact of <b>black</b> <b>dross</b> has been investigated using simulated landfill conditions. Leachability studies were carried out using water, and other leach media to model the following conditions: humic acid-containing systems, acid rain (pH 2. 5), and acetic acid solutions (pH 5). Up to 60 % of the dross was leached out in all media with the production of the saline solution providing the major impact. Only small amounts of aluminium were leached out under all these condition. No leachability behaviour was detected once the <b>black</b> <b>dross</b> was washed. So landfilling washed <b>black</b> <b>dross</b> can minimise both environmental and economical problems. <b>Black</b> <b>dross</b> residue, after washing with water, is enriched with alumina. Added value chemicals (of > 95 % purity) including aluminium hydroxide, alumina, aluminium chloride, aluminium nitrate, aluminium sulphate and aluminium carboxylates have been prepared using the washed <b>black</b> <b>dross.</b> Preliminary calculations have shown that the technology developed to recycle <b>black</b> <b>dross</b> to added-value chemicals is economically viable. A methodology has been developed which enables low grade alumnium waste, <b>black</b> <b>dross,</b> to be treated, commercially viable chemicals to be prepared, reagent use to be minimised through recycle and the diversion of millions of tonnes of furnace residue from landfill.

40|$|Aluminium {{recycling}} requires 95 % {{less energy}} than primary production with {{no loss of}} quality. The <b>Black</b> <b>Dross</b> (BD) produced during secondary aluminium production contains high amounts of water-soluble compounds, therefore it is considered as a toxic waste. In the present work, salt removal from BD by thermal treatment has been investigated in laboratory scale. The optimum conditions for treatment were established, i. e., temperature, gas flow rate, holding time, rotation rate, and sample size. The overall degree of chloride removal was established to increase {{as a function of}} time and temperature. Even Pretreated <b>Black</b> <b>Dross</b> (PBD) was evaluated as a possible raw material for the production of a calcium aluminate-based ladle-fluxing agent {{to be used in the}} steel industry. The effects of different process parameters on the properties of the produced flux were experimentally investigated, i. e. CaO/Al 2 O 3 ratio, temperature, holding time, and cooling media. The utilization of PBD as the alumina source during the production of a calcium aluminate fluxing agent shows promising results. The iron/steel industry is responsible for 9 % of anthropogenic energy and process CO 2 emissions. It is believed that the only way to a long-term reduction of the CO 2 emissions from the iron/steel industry is commercialization of alternative processes such as Direct Reduction (DR) of iron oxide. Detailed knowledge of the kinetics of the reduction reactions is, however, a prerequisite for the design and optimization of the DR process. To obtain a better understanding of the reduction kinetics, a model was developed step-by-step, from a single pellet to a fixed bed with many pellets. The equations were solved using the commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics®. The final model considers the reaction rate and mass transfer inside the pellet, as well as the mass transfers and heat transfer in the fixed bed. All the models were verified against experimental results, and where found to describe the results in a satisfying way. QC 20161128 </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the non-waste {{utilisation}} of aluminium recycling waste called non-metallic products (NMP) and their reprocessing into environmentally friendly material. In the present studies, lightweight expanded clay aggregates were produced from natural plastic clay and NMP. They were obtained recovering Al metal from <b>black</b> <b>dross</b> by using conventional metallurgical process. Based on the results obtained from chemical and mineralogical investigations of NMP, heat treatment in the temperature range from 1150 ◦C to 1280 ◦C was selected as an appropriate method to eliminate impurities of residues, such as aluminium nitride (AlN), iron sulphite (FeSO 3), aluminium chloride (AlCl 3). Emissions of gases during high-temperature treatment of NMP act as initiators to create extra porous structure of sintered ceramic bodies. The effect of raw material composition, previous treatment of NMP and sintering temperatures on the aggregate’s properties were evaluated. Physical and microstructural properties of sintered aggregates were determined...|$|R

40|$|A common {{assumption}} is that fire destroys fingerprint evidence. Recent studies have sought to challenge this assumption. This study presents a comparative evaluation of soot removal and fingerprint enhancement techniques, following fire(s) to ascertain optimal process efficacy for recovering fingerprints. Two car burns and a cremation oven {{were used to determine}} the temperature range. Temperatures of 300, 450 and 600 °C were used in simulated, controlled fires wherein cars had prints deposited on rear view mirrors. Burning occurred in a shipping container designed to approximate the variables relating to car arson. Soot removal was undertaken by tape lifting, sodium hydroxide solution, or liquid latex casting. The fingerprint enhancement techniques comprised <b>black</b> magnetic, <b>aluminium</b> and <b>black</b> suspension powders, or cyanoacrylate fuming with BY 40 dye. A fingerprint expert classified prints as un/identifiable according to standards to be submitted as evidence in court. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed on the data using a p value of 3 ̆c 0. 05 to determine statistical significance. Temperature was the biggest factor affecting fingerprint recovery. There were no statistically significant differences found between any of the soot removal methods used. Higher counts of identifiable prints were recovered with black magnetic powder and cyanoacrylate/BY 40 compared to the other methods used but these findings were not statistically significant. It is recommended that recovery of fire-exposed fingerprints (which are not protected) is undertaken where suspected maximum temperatures are 3 ̆c 450 °C. Evaluation of optimal soot removal and fingerprint enhancement techniques should be conducted on a case by case basis...|$|R
