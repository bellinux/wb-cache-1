5|$|In 1982 Edwards, by now an {{established}} scholar of diplomatic history, was <b>appointed</b> <b>Official</b> Historian and general editor of The Official History of Australia's Involvement in Southeast Asian Conflicts 1948–1975. Based {{out of the}} Australian War Memorial (AWM) in Canberra, the multi-volume history was commissioned to cover Australia's involvement in the Malayan Emergency, Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation and Vietnam War. Edwards continued the tradition established by Charles Bean, Gavin Long and Robert J. O'Neill in Australia's earlier official war histories by adopting a holistic approach that sought to analyse the operational, strategic, political, social and medical aspects of the Australian experience. But in dealing with twenty-seven years of history, the series spanned the longest time period of an Australian official history commissioned to that time. The end result was a nine-volume series, published between 1992 and 2012, with contributions from nine historians.|$|E
