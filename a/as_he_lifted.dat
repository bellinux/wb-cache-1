25|$|Both Worcestershire Royals and Glamorgan Dragons were {{knocked out}} before the last round of the Twenty20 Cup group stage, so the match at New Road was fairly academic. It did not stop Worcestershire from {{amassing}} {{one of the highest}} scores in Twenty20 Cup history with 223 for 9 - Ben Smith only taking 45 balls to smack 105 off the Glamorgan bowlers, with twelve fours and six sixes, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> his career Twenty20 average from 15 to 20.62. The partnership of 149 with Graeme Hick was enough to win the match for Worcestershire, as Glamorgan never quite got the hang of Shoaib Akhtar - who bowled two overs for 14 with a no-ball and a wide. Glamorgan ended up only losing five wickets, but 224 was always too much to ask, and they finished with a total 186 for 5.|$|E

[...] Allen asked, [...] "What's that, Elvis?" [...] "Blue suede shoes" [...] was the answer, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> his left foot to show the audience. Presley mentioned blue suede shoes a second time on this show: in a song during the [...] "Range Roundup" [...] comedy skit with Allen, Andy Griffith, and Imogene Coca, he delivered the line, [...] "I'm a-warnin' you galoots, don't step on my blue suede shoes." ...|$|E

2500|$|At 9:10 AM Lieutenant Colonel John C. Meyer of 487th Fighter Squadron (352 FG) was {{preparing}} for takeoff in [...] "Petie III" [...] P-51 Mustang with 11 others. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> off he noticed flak bursts over Ophoven and one Fw 190 heading straight at him, piloted by Gefreiter Böhm intent on strafing a C-47 Skytrain transport. Meyer had not retracted his landing gear when he fired at the Fw 190 which cartwheeled and exploded next to the C-47. Despite the attack other P-51s {{were able to take}} off and JG 11 soon lost eight pilots. Obergefreiter Karlheinz Sistenich, Feldwebel Harald Scharz, Feldwebel Herbert Kraschinski, Oberleutnant August Engel all died, while Feldwebel Karl Miller was severely burnt after crash landing. There was [...] one casualty among Allied ground crew. The U.S. flak crews held fire for fear of hitting a friendly aircraft and Allied pilots were cautious of firing at low flying 109s to avoid strafing the base. Flak crews hit one chasing P-51 which had to land damaged.|$|E
2500|$|His {{most memorable}} moment {{came in the}} 1997 ICC Trophy, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> the cup for his side. He contributed a quickfire 22 of 27 balls, {{including}} a six and a four, in the final. Earlier, he had played a captain's knock in the do-or-die game against the Netherlands. His 68* helped Bangladesh win by 3 wicket. Bangladesh were struggling at 15/4, chasing a small total, after the Dutch fast bowler Lefebre demolished the top order. Then Akram Khan {{changed the course of}} the match with two half-century partnerships with the veteran Minhajul Abedin and the medium-pacer Saiful Islam. [...] Overall, he finished the tournament with 185 runs at an average of 37.00. His effort against the Dutch is not his only match winning innings in International Cricket Council Trophy history. In 1994, batting at No. 7, he scored 64* against USA, taking his team from 36/5 to 147/7, winning the match by 3 wickets. And in 1990, he took Bangladesh to a vital 3 wicket win against Fiji with a knock of 42*. Overall, in 24 matches in 3 ICC Trophy tournaments, he scored 476 runs at an average of 36.61.
