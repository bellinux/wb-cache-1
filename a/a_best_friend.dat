[...] "There's clearly a lot of feelings involved with having <b>a</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> who is not in your band anymore," [...] Feldmann said. For him, the song [...] "acts as a bittersweet homage, a goodbye to this city... while acknowledging the interpersonal relationships within the band." [...] Stump also collaborated in the writing process for [...] "San Diego". [...] "The Only Thing That Matters" [...] originally began as a cowpunk-infused number until Hoppus re-wrote it. [...] "California" [...] is about [...] "giving credit to how lucky we are to have lived here and grown up" [...] in California.

500|$|USA Todays Robert Bianco credits Monica and Chandler's {{relationship}} and their wedding in the episode [...] "The One With Monica and Chandler's Wedding" [...] with saving Friends.

[...] Although admitting that the overall episode [...] "is not one of Friends best", Bianco explained that [...] "The wedding changed all that, and in remarkable fashion." [...] While BuzzFeed ranked Monica and Chandler the 23rd best television couple, E! placed the couple second on its ranking of the greatest Friends couples, with author Sydney Bucksbaum writing, [...] "It's {{hard to imagine a}} time when Monica and Chandler weren't together, but it took them four seasons to actually get together. From then on, it was clear that they were meant to be." [...] Tim Gerstenberger of TV Overmind echoed this sentiment by ranking Chandler Monica's best boyfriend, awarding him an 'A' grade. Gerstenberger penned, [...] "I {{would not be able to}} face myself every day if I did not rank Chandler the best of Monica’s boyfriends from Friends. The two ended up getting married, which just goes to show that some one night stands are meant to last." [...] Monica and Ross' relationship was also influential. According to Kriti Tulsiani of IBNLive, the characters [...] "provide a perfect exception to the myth that one cannot find <b>a</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> in their sibling particularly when they are of opposite sex ... they have broken all the conventional boundaries of a brother-sister relationship."
