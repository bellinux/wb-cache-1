40|$|Nicotinic acid, {{used for}} {{atherosclerosis}} treatment, has an adverse effect of skin flushing. The flushing mechanism, {{thought to be}} caused by the release of prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2), is not well understood. We aimed to identify which cells mediate the flushing effect. Nicotinic acid receptor (GPR 109 A) gene expression was assessed in various tissues and cell lines. Cells expressing GPR 109 A mRNA were further assayed for PGD 2 release in response to nicotinic acid. Of all samples, only skin was able to release PGD 2 upon stimulation with nicotinic acid. The responsive cells were localized to the epidermis, and immunocytochemical studies revealed the presence of GPR 109 A on epidermal Langerhans cells. CD 34 + cells isolated from human blood and differentiated into Langerhans cells (hLC-L) also showed GPR 109 A expression. IFNγ treatment increased both mRNA and plasma membrane expression of GPR 109 A. IFNγ-stimulated hLC-Ls released PGD 2 in response to nicotinic acid in a dose-dependant manner (effector concentration for half-maximum response= 1. 2 mm± 0. 7). <b>Acifran,</b> a structurally distinct GPR 109 A ligand, also increased PGD 2 release, whereas isonicotinic acid, a nicotinic acid analog with low affinity for GPR 109 A, had no effect. These results suggest that nicotinic acid mediates its flushing side effect by interacting with GPR 109 A on skin Langerhans cells, resulting in release of PGD 2...|$|E
