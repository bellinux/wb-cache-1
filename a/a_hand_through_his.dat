60|$|Next moment Ferris {{was lifted}} from his chair, and {{in less than}} ten minutes Dane thrust him into the wagon, where another man, who passed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> arm, sat beside him. It was a very long drive to the railroad, but few words were {{exchanged}} during it, and {{when they reached the}} settlement one of Ferris's companions mounted guard outside the hotel he found accommodation in, until the Montreal express crawled up above the rim of the prairie. Then both went with him to the station, and as the long cars rolled in Dane turned quietly to the lad.|$|E
6000|$|The unconcern of {{her husband}} was even more strikingly true, than the simple {{language}} of his wife would appear to convey. Content had not only laid aside his weapon, but he had resumed his seat near the fire, with an air as calm, as assured, and it might have seemed to one watchfully observant, as understanding, as her own. Until now, the stout Dudley had remained leaning on his piece, immovable and apparently unconscious as a statue. But, following the injunctions of one he was accustomed to obey, he placed the musket against the wall, with {{the care of a}} hunter, and then running <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> shaggy locks, as though the action might quicken ideas that were never remarkably active, he bluntly exclaimed-- ...|$|E
50|$|During the Android arc, Yamcha is {{the first}} to {{encounter}} Android #19 and #20, and is left for dead when #20 absorbs his chi and drives <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> chest. He is revived by a Senzu bean and takes the heart-diseased Goku home to get his medicine after the Super Saiyan loses to #19. Yamcha later joins the others in the Cell Games and teams up with Tenshinhan to protect the weakened Goku from the Cell Juniors, before losing to them. Following Cell's defeat at the hands of Son Gohan and Goku's death, Yamcha and the others return to their peaceful lives. In the alternate timeline of the Cell arc, like most of the heroes, Yamcha was killed in the encounter with the Androids.|$|E

60|$|She put <b>a</b> detaining <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> arm {{again and}} gave it a little gentle squeeze. A huge feather almost rested on his shoulder, and the scent of eau-de-Cologne assailed his nostrils. He walked on in silent amazement at finding himself in such a position.|$|R

5000|$|During his {{ascent to}} Hueco Mundo, Aizen {{discards}} his guise by removing {{his glasses and}} sweeps <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair to reveal menacing eyes and a very different hairstyle. Telling Jūshirō Ukitake he intends to [...] "end the unbearable vacancy on the world's throne", Aizen's agenda is revealed to be {{the assassination of the}} Soul King so he can become the new ruler of the Soul Society. After fusing the Hōgyoku into himself, Aizen becomes overconfident to the point of believing him to be invincible. But when fighting Ichigo Kurosaki after he mastered the Final Getsuga Tensho, unnerved by a stronger foe, Aizen discards his calm nature and becomes crazed with rage. His arrogance ultimately led to his defeat at the hands of Ichigo, and his sealing by Urahara. As Ichigo later mentioned, there seemed be a hint of sadness in Aizen's reasoning and high level of power, and that his current condition by the time of his defeat may have been the Hōgyoku granting his subconscious desire. By the end of the series he becomes somewhat of a changed person, and voluntarily goes back to his sentence having a new outlook on life.|$|E

50|$|Although fairly popular, Magaddino had {{enemies and}} survived several {{assassination}} attempts. In 1936, rival gangsters attempted to kill Magaddino with a bomb, killing his sister instead. In 1958, an assassin tossed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> grenade <b>through</b> <b>his</b> kitchen window, which failed to explode. This second attempt {{on his life}} {{was said to be}} directed by mobsters who blamed Magaddino for the failed Apalachin Meeting, which was raided by New York State Police.|$|R

Math rules with <b>a</b> just <b>hand,</b> and <b>through</b> <b>his</b> leadership Arawn, Death-Lord is at least partly held in check. He dwells in the stronghold Caer Dathyl, north of the Eagle Mountains.|$|R
60|$|The {{exquisite}} paragraphs in {{this and}} the next page, in addition to others scattered, though with <b>a</b> sparing <b>hand,</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> novels, afford sufficient proof that De Foe was a first-rate master of periodic style; but with sound judgment, and the fine tact of genius, he has avoided it as adverse to, nay, incompatible with, the every-day matter of fact realness, which forms the charm and the character of all his romances. The Robinson Crusoe is like the vision of a happy night-mair, such as a denizen of Elysium might be supposed to have from a little excess in his nectar and ambrosia supper. Our imagination is kept in full play, excited to the highest; yet all the while we are touching, or touched by, common flesh and blood.|$|R
6000|$|What a conquering air {{there is}} about these! What an irresistible Mr. Congreve it is! Sinner! of course {{he will be a}} sinner, the {{delightful}} rascal! Win her; of course he will win her, the victorious rogue! He knows he will: he must—with such a grace, with such a fashion, with such a splendid embroidered suit—you see him with red-heeled shoes deliciously turned out, passing <b>a</b> fair jewelled <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> dishevelled periwig, and delivering a killing ogle along with his scented billet. And Sabina? What a comparison that is between the nymph and the sun! The sun gives Sabina the pas, and does not venture to rise before her ladyship: the morn’s bright beams are less glorious than her fair eyes: but before night everybody will be frozen by her glances: everybody but one lucky rogue who shall be nameless: Louis Quatorze in all his glory is hardly more splendid than our Phoebus Apollo of the Mall and Spring Garden.(71) ...|$|R
2500|$|His {{great success}} {{compelled}} van Dyck {{to maintain a}} large workshop in London, a studio which was to become [...] "virtually a production line for portraits". According to a visitor to his studio he usually only made a drawing on paper, which was then enlarged onto canvas by an assistant; he then painted the head himself. The clothes were left at the studio and often sent out to specialists. In his last years these studio collaborations accounted for some decline {{in the quality of}} work. [...] In addition many copies untouched by him, or virtually so, were produced by the workshop, as well as by professional copyists and later painters; the number of paintings ascribed to him had by the 19th century become huge, as with Rembrandt, Titian and others. However, most of his assistants and copyists could not approach the refinement of his manner, so compared to many masters consensus among art historians on attributions to him is usually relatively easy to reach, and museum labelling is now mostly updated (country house attributions may be more dubious in some cases). The relatively few names of his assistants that are known are Dutch or Flemish; he probably preferred to use trained Flemings, as no English equivalent training yet existed. [...] Adriaen Hanneman (1604–71) returned to his native Hague in 1638 to become the leading portraitist there. [...] Van Dyck's enormous influence on English art does not come from <b>a</b> tradition <b>handed</b> down <b>through</b> <b>his</b> pupils; in fact {{it is not possible to}} document a connection to his studio for any English painter of any significance.|$|R
