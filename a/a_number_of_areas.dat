5|$|The fishery {{industry}} {{not only}} threatens marine mammals through by-catch, but also through competition for food.

As the fish stocks have been depleted, the competition between marine mammals and fisheries has sometimes led to conflict. Large-scale culling of populations of marine mammals by commercial fishers has been initiated in <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> in order to protect fish stocks for human consumption.|$|E
