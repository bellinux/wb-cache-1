40|$|Objective: Results {{from the}} WTIC Phase 2 {{study showed that}} general {{aviation}} (GA) pilots performed poorly at detecting aviation routine weather report (METAR) symbol changes during flight (Ahlstrom & Suss, 2014) —attributed to the change-blindness phenomena. Here, we address this gap by examining {{the potential benefits of}} weather state-change notifications on pilots’ behavior and Weather Situation Awareness (WSA) during a simulated flight. A second objective {{of this study was to}} assess pilot sensitivity to weather symbology changes on Topological, Visual Flight Rules (VFR), and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) <b>aeronautical</b> <b>map</b> backgrounds in a change-detection experiment. Method: Seventy-three GA pilots volunteered to participate in the study. During a simulated weather scenario, participants were randomly assigned to an experimental or a control group and flew a single-engine GA aircraft, initially under Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). The experimental group was equipped with a vibrating bracelet that notified participants of state-changes to displayed METAR, Special-Use Airspace (SUA), and Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET) symbols. During the simulation, we recorded each participant’s horizontal and vertical flight profile, WSA, decision-making, cognitive engagement, weather presentation interaction, and distance from the aircraft to hazardous weather. Finally, we used a change-detection experiment to assess participant sensitivity to changes in weather symbols on three different backgrounds. Results: By assessing WSA, we found that the experimental group provided credibly more communications of weather information and maneuver/course change information and a higher number of “out-the-window” reports to the pilot following than the control group provided. This supports our hypothesis that weather state-change notifications result in earlier and more accurate recognition of weather state-changes and, thereby, positively improves participant WSA. The results of distance-to-weather analyses showed that both groups kept similar distances to 30 dBZ precipitation cells. It also showed, however, that participants in both groups flew closer to hazardous weather than what is recommended in current guidelines. Although not a credible difference, there were more participant reports of VFR flights into Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) in the control group (N = 33) than in the experimental group (N = 27). When analyzing the functional near-infrared (fNIR) data, we found credibly higher prefrontal oxygenation levels in the control group compared to the experimental group. We attribute the reduced cognitive load in the experimental group to increased participant WSA. Because of the state-change notifications, participants were more attentive to information on the weather presentation, which enhanced planning and decision-making and reduced cognitive load. Finally, participant discrimination performance for symbol changes was low on the Topological, IFR, and VFR map backgrounds when compared to the performance of a simulated group of ideal observers. We interpret these findings to indicate that much work is still needed to optimize the symbology for cockpit weather presentations to achieve good symbol discrimination and reduce the time needed to differentiate weather presentation elements on all backgrounds. Conclusion: Weather state-change notifications improved WSA and reduced cognitive workload. However, these improvements did not translate to changes in participants’ weather-avoiding behavior, indicating gaps in pilot understanding of the information or gaps in pilot decision making. Applications: This simulation is part of an ongoing assessment of the effects of weather-presentation symbology related to the optimization of weather presentations in cockpits...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the state-of-the-knowledge of recent innovations in airport obstruction surveys and spaceborne satellite imagery technologies for airport layout plans and related airport applications. Remote sensing LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) {{technology has been}} evaluated in recent years for acceptable topographic accuracy standards, and used to expedite highway alignment design and construction projects. Recent research efforts of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and NOAA in the US prove that airborne LIDAR topographic data can be used effectively and accurately for mapping obstructions including treetops, cell towers, and poles. This significant improvement saves time and costs, compared to traditional field topographic surveying and aerial photogrammetric surveys. The objective and scope of an on-going national study on LIDAR obstruction survey technology in the US is presented. The overall goal is to enhance the accuracy and current practice of airport obstruction surveys while reducing costs. The research study investigates the data needs, formats, hardware, and software used to ensure the compatibility of airborne LIDAR data with geographic information systems (GIS), computer-aided design (CAD), visualization, and other applications, which airports may use in preparation of obstruction surveys and <b>aeronautical</b> <b>maps.</b> Also, discussed is, use of aerial and satellite stereo imageries for mapping obstructions. Presented are examples of visualization tools and 3 D modeling of obstruction-free surface and airport infrastructure. These remote sensing data offer tremendous benefits to airport operators and airlines enhancing safety, expediting obstruction surveys, and adapting visualization technologies for airport applications. Vendor-neutral specifications and procedures are {{needed in order to}} procure and adapt these innovative LIDAR data acquisition and visualization technologies, which must be acceptable to the aviation agencies, airports, and airlines...|$|R
