5|$|Because {{there are}} 26 letters (2×13) {{in the basic}} Latin alphabet, ROT13 is its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, the same {{algorithm}} is applied, so the same <b>action</b> <b>can</b> be used for encoding and decoding. The algorithm provides virtually no cryptographic security, and is often cited as a canonical example of weak encryption.|$|E
5|$|Organ stops can be {{combined}} in countless permutations, resulting in {{a great variety of}} sounds. A combination <b>action</b> <b>can</b> be used to switch instantly from one combination of stops (called a registration) to another. Combination actions feature small buttons called pistons that can be pressed by the organist, generally located beneath the keys of each manual (thumb pistons) or above the pedalboard (toe pistons). The pistons may be divisional (affecting only a single division) or general (affecting all the divisions), and are either preset by the organ builder or can be altered by the organist. Modern combination actions operate via computer memory, and can store several channels of registrations.|$|E
5|$|The planet Krypton, {{unstable}} {{from years}} of industrial mining, faces impending destruction. Jor-El, chief advisor to Krypton's supreme council, recommends the council give him control of the genetics codex. Before any <b>action</b> <b>can</b> be taken, soldiers led by General Zod, {{an old friend of}} Jor-El's, launch an uprising and arrest the councilors. Realizing that Krypton is doomed, Jor-El steals genetic codes sought by Zod and infuses them into the DNA of his infant son, Kal-El – the first naturally born Kryptonian child in centuries. Donning his old armor, Jor-El sacrifices his life to allow his son to escape on a preprogrammed spacecraft. Zod orders the rocket's destruction, only to learn that forces loyal to the council have suppressed the rebellion. In a brief trial, Zod and several of the surviving rebels are convicted of treason and sentenced to the Phantom Zone moments before Krypton explodes.|$|E
50|$|Actions {{occur when}} a rule is true. <b>Actions</b> <b>can</b> include validating a schema, declaring the {{instance}} document invalid, accepting {{this part of}} the instance document as valid, and continue validating as the parent did. <b>Actions</b> <b>can</b> also change the current NVDL mode. Multiple <b>actions</b> <b>can</b> be taken when a rule is true; this allows for validating a section of the instance document with multiple schemas of a different type.|$|R

5|$|This mode was {{introduced}} in WWE 2K15, social media followers were counted for the WWE Universe liking the player (the number of followers can decrease if bad performances occur during matches); pre-set cutscenes {{that used to be}} created for Story Mode in WWE '12 to WWE 2K14 appear at random times. In WWE 2K16, the player has to fight for ranks to earn championships (the main goal is to reach the WWE Hall of Fame by fulfilling certain requirements). WWE 2K17 brings in a promo engine and every <b>action</b> <b>can</b> trigger a backstage brawl depending on what answer the created superstar gives. WWE 2K18 continues with the promo engine from 2k17 with free roaming now a central focus.|$|E

25|$|In {{developing}} countries, childhood {{mortality rates}} related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases {{can be reduced}} by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.

25|$|Because of {{universal}} jurisdiction, <b>action</b> <b>can</b> be taken against pirates without objection from the flag {{state of the}} pirate vessel. This represents {{an exception to the}} principle extra territorium jus dicenti impune non paretur ("One who exercises jurisdiction out of his territory is not obeyed with impunity").|$|E
25|$|The Guard, Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Identification Badge can be revoked if {{a soldier}} disgraces {{him or herself}} {{in a manner that}} brings dishonor on the Tomb.

25|$|A major {{penalty is}} {{assessed}} for serious offenses, generally involving intent to injure or an intentional penalty action {{to prevent a}} shot during the attacking team's breakaway. Major penalties are four minutes in length and do not end upon the scoring of a goal. Interruption of a breakaway by a penalty <b>action</b> <b>can</b> result in a penalty shot.|$|E
25|$|The sextet {{group has}} a normal abelian {{subgroup}} H of order 64, isomorphic to the hexacode, a vector space of length 6 and dimension 3 over F4. A non-zero element in H does double transpositions within 4 or 6 of the columns. Its <b>action</b> <b>can</b> {{be thought of}} as addition of vector co-ordinates to row numbers.|$|E
25|$|Monitoring and {{controlling}} consists of those processes performed to observe project execution so that potential {{problems can be}} identified {{in a timely manner}} and corrective <b>action</b> <b>can</b> be taken, when necessary, to control the execution of the project.

25|$|Self-forgiveness {{happens in}} {{situations}} where an individual has done something that they perceive to be morally wrong and they consider themselves {{to be responsible for}} the wrongdoing. Self-forgiveness is the overcoming of negative emotions that the wrongdoer associates with the wrongful action. Negative emotions associated with wrongful <b>action</b> <b>can</b> include guilt, regret, remorse, blame, shame, self-hatred and/or self-contempt.|$|E
25|$|This was our paradox: no {{course of}} action could be {{determined}} by a rule, because every course of <b>action</b> <b>can</b> be made out to accord with the rule. The answer was: if everything can be made out to accord with the rule, then {{it can also be}} made out to conflict with it. And there would be neither accord nor conflict here.|$|E
25|$|Although no {{subsequent}} political <b>action</b> <b>can</b> condone wrong deeds, {{history is}} replete with examples of men who have risen to power by employing stern, grim, and even frightful methods, but who, nevertheless when their life is revealed as a whole, have been regarded as great figures whose lives have enriched the story of mankind. So may it be with Hitler.|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{application of}} formal methods is the specification, design, {{and analysis of}} functional aspects of (distributed) systems. Recently the study of quantitative aspects of such systems based on formal methods has come into focus.

25|$|Pseudoephedrine is a stimulant, {{but it is}} {{well known}} for {{shrinking}} swollen nasal mucous membranes, so it is often used as a decongestant. It reduces tissue hyperemia, edema, and nasal congestion commonly associated with colds or allergies. Other beneficial effects may include increasing the drainage of sinus secretions, and opening of obstructed Eustachian tubes. The same vasoconstriction <b>action</b> <b>can</b> also result in hypertension, which is a noted side effect of pseudoephedrine.|$|E
25|$|When the Court {{rules on}} matters {{involving}} {{the interpretation of}} laws rather than of the Constitution, simple legislative <b>action</b> <b>can</b> reverse the decisions (for example, in 2009 Congress passed the Lilly Ledbetter act, superseding the limitations given in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. in 2007). Also, the Supreme Court is not immune from political and institutional consideration: lower federal courts and state courts sometimes resist doctrinal innovations, as do law enforcement officials.|$|E
25|$|The {{owner of}} a {{trademark}} may pursue legal action against trademark infringement. Most countries require formal registration of a trademark as a precondition for pursuing this type of action. The United States, Canada and other countries also recognize common law trademark rights, which means <b>action</b> <b>can</b> be taken to protect an unregistered trademark {{if it is in}} use. Still, common law trademarks offer the holder in general less legal protection than registered trademarks.|$|E
