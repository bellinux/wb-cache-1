Since they wanted to <b>arrange</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> Racibórz, he requests the presence of Duchess Euphemia of Opole and her daughter, calling a Congress to discuss matters relating to the wedding of Władysław's daughter and Henry IV. The treatments of King Ottokar II were explained in his desire to obtain the support of [...] Henry IV and Władysław of Opole {{in the war against}} Rudolf I of Habsburg, King of Germany. According to this hypothesis, there is a proof that {{in the second half of}} 1277, there was an alliance between the Dukes of Wrocław and Opole. Among the documents issued by Władysław of Opole and his sons, was found an act who provide support for all the plans of Henry IV. This document was issued after the marriage, because there Duke of Opole called Henry IV his son-in-law, and later in 1278, was added a clause that guarantees the obligations of the Duke of Opole with King Ottokar II of Bohemia, who fell on 26 August 1278 in the Battle on the Marchfeld. It is believed that the marriage took place in 1277 after Henry IV regained his freedom at the cost of gave Bolesław II the third part of his lands, included Środa Śląska and Strzegom (both inherited by Henry IV from his uncle Władysław); at that time, the conclusion of an alliance with the Dukes of Opole was the most favorable for Henry IV. The complaints presented to the Pope supported the hypothesis that the wedding took place in Opole, and was chaired by the Bishop of Wrocław, Thomas II Zaremba.

In October 1976 Brian Stewart, 13 years old, was killed in Belfast by a plastic bullet. He was shot in the face by a British soldier. Paul Whitters, aged 15, from Derry, died in April 1981 as the result of a bullet to the head fired by an RUC policeman. In Belfast, a 12-year-old, Carol Ann Kelly, was fatally shot on her way home after buying milk, in May 1981. It was at this point that Groves decided to do something and to have those [...] "deadly bullets banned". In 1982, she learned that the bullets were manufactured by an American company.

Bowlegs promised to deliver the men responsible, although they apparently were members of Chipco's band, over whom Bowlegs had no authority. Chipco decided to surrender three men as the possible killers, and they were arrested when they showed up to trade in Fort Myers. Once in custody, the three protested their innocence, saying that Chipco did not like them and that other men in Chipco's band were the actual killers, and Captain Casey believed them. The three men tried to escape from the jail in Tampa but were caught and chained up in their cell. They were later found hanging from the bars in their cell. One was still alive when found but was not cut down until the next day, after he had died. It was noted in the community that the constable who had chained the three men in their cell was the father-in-law of a brother of one of the men killed at the Kennedy and Darling store in 1849 (the Paynes Creek Massacre).|$|E

40|$|The optimal {{organization}} {{of research and}} development (R&D) in a market economy is one of the unsettled questions of economics. R&D has great externalities that make its support more complicated than most goods in which the contrasting of private benefits with private costs in a market system approximates the social welfare. Thus, the {{organization of}} R&D becomes a key issue in a transition to a market system of a former centrally planned economy. This is particularly so for the USSR, which has been a major source of science and technology. Recognizing its importance, Deputy Prime Minister Laverov approached the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) to initiate collaborative work with the USSR State Committee for Science and Technology and the USSR Academy of Sciences on the topic of Research and Development Management in the Transition to a Market Economy in the autumn of 1990. Dr. Peter de Janosi, Director of IIASA, and Professor Merton J. Peck, Leader of the Economic Reform and Integration (ERI) Project (also IIASA), met the Deputy Prime Minister to discuss such a cooperation. The collaboration began with a meeting in November 1990 organized by IIASA {{with the support of the}} Committee for Systems Analysis of the USSR Academy of Sciences. This meeting explored the feasibility of creating an IIASA research activity on the impact of economic reform and transition upon the organization and management of science and technology in the USSR. An agreement was reached that IIASA would participate in an activity with the USSR State Committee for Science and Technology concerning R&D Management in the Transition to a Market Economy. This activity would be led by Professor Richard Levin from Yale University and Dr. Sergei Glaziev from the Central Economic and Mathematical Institute in Moscow. The second conference held on this topic, cosponsored by the USSR State Committee for Science and Technology and IIASA, and organized with the International Center for Research into Economic Transformations (Moscow), was an outgrowth of discussions with representatives of the USSR Academy of Sciences, the State Committee, and the Center in January 1991. IIASA was invited to <b>arrange</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> which the numerous issues involved in the restructuring and organization of scientific and technological activities in the Soviet Union could be discussed in systematic ways. Soviet experts prepared papers dealing with the Soviet Union's present situation and reform plans regarding R&D management. These papers were presented at the Conference and commented on by a small group of economists, engineers, and R&D managers from the United States, Europe, and Japan. The Conference, held in Moscow in July 1991, provided an exceptional opportunity to review and discuss science policy in a economy making the difficult transition to a market system. The new data and ideas for changes in the Soviet science and technology sector were of great interest to experts from West and East. The discussions resulted in a commitment to longer term research on an extended list of topics. More about the future plans can be read in the corresponding section of this paper...|$|E
