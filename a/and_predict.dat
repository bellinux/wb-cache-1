5|$|English astrology {{had reached}} its zenith by the 17th century. Astrologers were theorists, researchers, and social engineers, {{as well as}} {{providing}} individual advice to everyone from monarchs downwards. Among other things, astrologers could advise on the best time to take a journey or harvest a crop, diagnose and prescribe for physical or mental illnesses, <b>and</b> <b>predict</b> natural disasters. This underpinned a system in which everything—people, the world, the universe—was understood to be interconnected, and astrology co-existed happily with religion, magic and science.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of its development, the Sharingan will grant the user three unique abilities: The first being its famous ability for the user to {{instantly}} memorize and replicate any opponent's movement and attacks with perfect accuracy. The Sharingan's second ability grants the user increased ocular perception, allowing them to read <b>and</b> <b>predict</b> the movements and actions of fast-moving objects. This also allows the user to easily recognize genjutsu and different forms of chakra (i.e.: to visualize chakra in different colors). Its final ability is a brand of scenarios that suggests actions and thoughts to the opponent, acting as {{an effective way to}} produce beyond genjutsu abilities or implant memories in another person.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{to these}} {{developments}} in psychology, a philosophical behaviorism (sometimes called logical behaviorism) was developed. This {{is characterized by}} a strong verificationism, which generally considers unverifiable statements about interior mental life pointless. For the behaviorist, mental states are not interior states on which one can make introspective reports. They are just descriptions of behavior or dispositions to behave in certain ways, made by third parties to explain <b>and</b> <b>predict</b> another's behavior.|$|E

5|$|An {{idea of the}} {{complexity}} of the metabolic networks in cells that contain thousands of different enzymes is given by the figure showing the interactions between just 43 proteins and 40 metabolites to the right: the sequences of genomes provide lists containing anything up to 45,000 genes. However, it is now possible to use this genomic data to reconstruct complete networks of biochemical reactions and produce more holistic mathematical models that may explain <b>and</b> <b>predict</b> their behavior. These models are especially powerful when used to integrate the pathway and metabolite data obtained through classical methods with data on gene expression from proteomic and DNA microarray studies. Using these techniques, a model of human metabolism has now been produced, which will guide future drug discovery and biochemical research. These models are now used in network analysis, to classify human diseases into groups that share common proteins or metabolites.|$|E
5|$|Astrology is {{the study}} of the {{movements}} and relative positions of celestial objects as a means for divining information about human affairs and terrestrial events. Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, and has its roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and some – such as the Indians, Chinese, and Maya – developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. Western astrology, one of the oldest astrological systems still in use, can trace its roots to 19th–17th century BCE Mesopotamia, from which it spread to Ancient Greece, Rome, the Arab world and eventually Central and Western Europe. Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of horoscopes that purport to explain aspects of a person's personality <b>and</b> <b>predict</b> significant events in their lives based on the positions of celestial objects; the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThis {{retrospective}} study {{aimed to explore}} the role of Glasgow Aneurysm Score (GAS) and Hardman Index (HI) in predicting outcome after elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). MethodsAll 71 patients who underwent elective EVAR in a single centre over 9 years were reviewed. Clinical data were used to classify patients into the three standard GAS tertiles and to score patients according to the HI. ResultsFifty-one patients scored ≥ 77 according to GAS. Actual <b>and</b> <b>predicted</b> mortality in this group were 3. 9 % and 9. 3 %. Seventeen patients scored between 69 and 77 with actual <b>and</b> <b>predicted</b> mortality of 0 % and 4. 1 %. Three patients scored less than 69 with actual <b>and</b> <b>predicted</b> mortality of 0 % and 2. 4 %. Ten patients scored ≥ 3 on the HI with actual <b>and</b> <b>predicted</b> mortality of 10 % and 100 %, respectively. Twenty-four patients scored 2 with actual <b>and</b> <b>predicted</b> mortality of 4. 2 % and 55 %. Twenty-seven patients scored 1 with actual <b>and</b> <b>predicted</b> mortality of 0 % and 28 %, respectively. Ten patients scored 0 with actual <b>and</b> <b>predicted</b> mortality of 0 % and 16 %, respectively. The χ 2 test showed extremely significant p value of 0. 0001 in case of HI, and p value of 0. 0800 for GAS, slightly less significant, {{probably due to the}} small sample size. ConclusionContrary to their role in ruptured and open aortic aneurysm repair, GAS and HI overestimate both mortality and morbidity following EVAR and are poor predictors of outcome...|$|R
5|$|Astrology, in its {{broadest}} sense, is {{the search}} for meaning in the sky. Early evidence for humans making conscious attempts to measure, record, <b>and</b> <b>predict</b> seasonal changes by reference to astronomical cycles, appears as markings on bones and cave walls, which show that lunar cycles were being noted as early as 25,000 years ago. This was a first step towards recording the Moon's influence upon tides and rivers, and towards organising a communal calendar. Farmers addressed agricultural needs with increasing knowledge of the constellations that appear in the different seasons—and used the rising of particular star-groups to herald annual floods or seasonal activities. By the 3rd millennium BCE, civilisations had sophisticated awareness of celestial cycles, and may have oriented temples in alignment with heliacal risings of the stars.|$|E
5|$|Many ancient civilizations {{observed}} astronomical bodies, {{often the}} Sun and Moon, to determine times, dates, and seasons. The first calendars {{may have been}} created during the last glacial period, by hunter-gatherers who employed tools such as sticks and bones to track the phases of the moon or the seasons. Stone circles, such as England's Stonehenge, were built {{in various parts of}} the world, especially in Prehistoric Europe, and are thought to have been used to time <b>and</b> <b>predict</b> seasonal and annual events such as equinoxes or solstices. As those megalithic civilizations left no recorded history, little is known of their calendars or timekeeping methods. Methods of sexagesimal timekeeping, now common in both Western and Eastern societies, are first attested nearly 4,000years ago in Mesopotamia and Egypt. Mesoamericans similarly modified their usual vigesimal counting system when dealing with calendars to produce a 360-day year.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of such tools {{has been driven}} by the large amount of genomic and proteomic data available for a variety of organisms, including the human genome. It is simply impossible to study all proteins experimentally, hence only a few are subjected to laboratory experiments while computational tools are used to extrapolate to similar proteins. Such homologous proteins can be efficiently identified in distantly related organisms by sequence alignment. Genome and gene sequences can be searched by a variety of tools for certain properties. Sequence profiling tools can find restriction enzyme sites, open reading frames in nucleotide sequences, <b>and</b> <b>predict</b> secondary structures. Phylogenetic trees can be constructed and evolutionary hypotheses developed using special software like ClustalW regarding the ancestry of modern organisms and the genes they express. The field of bioinformatics is now indispensable for the analysis of genes and proteins.|$|E

5|$|The {{secondary}} market started with comic book stores, and hobby shops displaying and selling cards, with the cards' values determined somewhat arbitrarily {{by the employees}} of the store. With {{the expansion of the}} internet, prices of cards were determined by the amount of tournament deck lists a given card would appear in. If a card was played in a tournament more frequently, the cost of the card would be higher (in addition to the market availability of the card). When eBay, Amazon, and other large online markets started to gain popularity, the Magic {{secondary market}} evolved substantially. Buying and selling Magic cards online became a source of income for people who learned how to manipulate the market. Today, the secondary market is so large and complex, it has become an area of study for consumer research, and some people make a career out of market manipulation, creating mathematical models to analyze the growth of cards' worth, <b>and</b> <b>predict</b> the market value of both individual cards, and entire sets of cards.|$|E
