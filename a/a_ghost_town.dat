5|$|Four miles (6.4km) west of {{the pass}} {{is the site of}} Independence, the village whose {{establishment}} on July 4 led to the pass's current name. It has been <b>a</b> <b>ghost</b> <b>town</b> since the early 20th century. In 1973 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Most of its buildings were cannibalized for their building supplies, but a few log cabins remain. The Aspen Historical Society, in conjunction with the U.S. Forest Service, built an interpretive trail with plaques.|$|E
5|$|Harold Oliver {{was born}} to Cornish {{immigrants}} James Oliver and Sarah Mill in the gold mining town of Waukaringa. It was common for Cornish people, where mining was a key industry, to move to Australia and use their knowledge to attempt a better life as the economy in Cornwall was waning. During Oliver's childhood in the 1890s the town was home to 600 people. Today it is <b>a</b> <b>ghost</b> <b>town.</b>|$|E
5|$|San Francisco {{had been}} a tiny {{settlement}} before the rush began. When residents learned about the discovery, it at first became <b>a</b> <b>ghost</b> <b>town</b> of abandoned ships and businesses, but then boomed as merchants and new people arrived. The population of San Francisco exploded from perhaps about 1,000 in 1848 to 25,000 full-time residents by 1850. Miners lived in tents, wood shanties, or deck cabins removed from abandoned ships.|$|E

5|$|Watie {{formed the}} Cherokee Mounted Rifles. He was a guerrilla fighter {{commanding}} Cherokee, Seminole, Creek, and Osage Indian soldiers. They earned a notorious reputation for their bold and brave fighting. Yearly, Federal troops {{all over the}} western United States hunted for Watie, but they never captured him. He surrendered on June 23 at Fort Towson, in the Choctaw Nations area at the village of Doaksville (now <b>a</b> <b>ghost</b> <b>town)</b> of the Indian Territory, being the last Confederate general to surrender in the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Early August 8, 1840, the Comanches {{surrounded}} the small port of Linnville, Texas, {{which was the}} second largest port in the Republic of Texas at the time, and began pillaging the stores and houses. Linnville, which is now <b>a</b> <b>ghost</b> <b>town,</b> was located 3.5 miles northeast of present-day Port Lavaca. The Comanches reportedly killed three whites, including customs officer Hugh Oran Watts, who had delayed his escape to retrieve a gold watch at his home (reportedly a family heirloom). After killing Watts, the Comanche captured his wife of only three weeks, the former Juliet Constance, and a black woman and child.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the rail {{connections}} was a death blow to the stage road. Gold production in Independence had declined sharply after 1884, {{and many of the}} town's early settlers had moved down the valley to Aspen. With the corresponding reduction in stage traffic and tolls, the Twin Lakes and Roaring Fork Toll Company could not afford to keep the road clear over the winter of 1886. Two years later, after the railroads began service, the company folded and abandoned the road. Independence itself met the same fate a decade later when its remaining population decamped to Aspen during the severe winter of 1899, leaving its buildings standing as <b>a</b> <b>ghost</b> <b>town</b> (one remaining resident lingered until 1920).|$|E

5|$|Construction of Route 25 east of Wareham, however, {{was delayed}} {{for nearly three}} decades to {{property}} disputes, environmental concerns and resistance from business owners in Buzzards Bay village, who claimed the freeway would divert all the traffic, and their business, elsewhere, leaving <b>a</b> <b>ghost</b> <b>town</b> in its wake. The proposed alignment ran through land {{where much of the}} state's cranberry harvest was located, and this led to lengthy lawsuits and delays. In particular, farmers were concerned that salt runoff from winter ice removal would harm cranberry harvests. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the MassDPW developed several proposals to control storm water runoff and avoid potential damage to the cranberry crops. Engineers for the department developed four different drainage systems to be used {{along the length of the}} freeway that would divert runoff away from the Wareham River basin. In addition, the freeway was planned with a thicker asphalt pavement that was largely impervious to water.|$|E
5|$|Harrison Clark left South Africa in 1887, but it {{is unclear}} why; {{according}} to a story that may be apocryphal, he fled the country as an outlaw soon after his revolver fired—by accident, so the story goes—and killed a man. Whatever the truth, he travelled to Mozambique, then a Portuguese territory, where {{he made his way}} upriver along the Zambezi until he reached Feira, a long-abandoned Portuguese settlement at the confluence of the Zambezi and Luangwa Rivers, in what is today southern Zambia. Feira was founded by missionaries from Portugal in about 1720, but by 1887 it was <b>a</b> <b>ghost</b> <b>town.</b> Its last inhabitants had fled amid a native rising about half a century before, and since then it had been deserted.|$|E
5|$|The pass {{was formed}} by glacial action and erosion in the region, and its first {{recorded}} sighting was by Zebulon Pike in 1806. Ferdinand Hayden surveyed it in 1873. As part of the Continental Divide, it was the limit of European settlement in the region at the time, with the land to the west reserved for the Ute people. Prospectors who defied governor Frederick Walker Pitkin's order crossed the pass on July 4, 1879, giving it its current name and setting up a similarly named village (now <b>a</b> <b>ghost</b> <b>town)</b> to its west. A toll road built across the pass was abandoned and neglected after a railroad connection was made to Aspen. A new road replaced it in the 1920s; portions of the old route can still be seen along the western approach. The Independence Pass Foundation, based in Aspen, works to repair damage to the pass's environment caused by both roads since 1984.|$|E

5|$|SR 88 {{begins at}} a diamond {{interchange}} with US 60, the Superstition Freeway, in southern Apache Junction. The route follows Idaho Road northward through a residential area with four lanes. Following a junction with Old West Highway, SR 88 turns northeast onto Apache Trail and narrows to two lanes. The route exits {{the city limits}} of Apache Junction, entering desert terrain. Passing <b>a</b> <b>ghost</b> <b>town</b> known as Goldfield, Apache Trail enters Tonto National Forest just northwest of Lost Dutchman State Park. SR 88 nears Canyon Lake south of the Mormon Flat Dam and follows {{a part of the}} southern coast of Canyon Lake. Apache Trail heads away from the Salt River. It passes through the town of Tortilla Flat, becoming an unpaved dirt trail winding eastward through the Superstition Mountains. SR 88 again turns northeast and nears Apache Lake. The route follows the Salt River northeast to the Theodore Roosevelt Dam, near which the route is again paved. SR 88 intersects with SR 188 along the coast of Theodore Roosevelt Lake.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} the {{development}} team chose Tokyo as the main setting was that its turbulent history, going through multiple phases of development and often suffering severe damage in wars or due to natural disasters, made it comparable with the fantasy settings of other games at the time. In a later interview, an Atlus staff member stated that this setting and style made it the antithesis of traditional fantasy RPGs, adding that this resulted in the game developing a punk spirit. Because of the post-apocalyptic setting of Megami Tensei II, the development team wanted to depict a time before the apocalypse. The decision to set the game in Tokyo was made by Suzuki and Kaneko, and was influenced by manga such as Violence Jack, Devilman, and Fist of the North Star. Kichijōji was decided to be the game's starting point due to Kaneko, Suzuki, and Ito all having lived in or near the area, or having visited it often. The abandoned Terminal Echo building there fascinated them, making them wonder how a building in such a prime location could remain unoccupied; Ito described it as two floors of arcade cabinets, {{with the rest of the}} building feeling like <b>a</b> <b>ghost</b> <b>town.</b> This fascination led to it being included as a dungeon in the game. While designing the maps, Kaneko wanted to use wire-frame models, but the Super Famicom's limited capacities meant this idea was scrapped.|$|E
5|$|The first {{trading post}} on Corpus Christi Bay was {{established}} by Henry Kinney in 1838 in present-day Corpus Christi. By the 1840s, the area developed into a settlement named after the bay, and a deepwater port {{was established in the}} 1870s. A bayfront that included a 32-foot overlooking statue of Jesus Christ was designed by Mount Rushmore sculptor Gutzon Borglum in 1928, but was turned down by the city in 1930. Later efforts to build a statue on the shore were also rejected. The bayside port would later grow into a major city, and had a population of 277,454 people during the 2000 U.S. census. In addition to Corpus Christi, Kinney also found Nuecestown (known to settlers as The Motts) in 1852, near the confluence of the Nueces River and Nueces Bay. The town was attacked by Mexican robbers in 1875, and underwent a steep decline. It is now <b>a</b> <b>ghost</b> <b>town</b> located in the Corpus Christi city limits. The city of Ingleside was founded on the northern shore of the bay in 1854, and grew slowly. It had a population of 9,388 in the 2000 census. Likewise, the city of Portland located on the northeastern bluff between the Nueces and Corpus Christi Bays, did not grow as rapidly as Corpus Christi, following its 1891 founding. During the 2000 census, it had 14,827 residents.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>ghost</b> <b>town</b> is an {{abandoned}} village, town, or city, usually one that contains substantial visible remains. A town often becomes <b>a</b> <b>ghost</b> <b>town</b> because the economic activity that supported it has failed, or due to natural or human-caused disasters such as floods, prolonged droughts, government actions, uncontrolled lawlessness, war, pollution, or nuclear disasters. The term can sometimes refer to cities, towns, and neighborhoods {{that are still}} populated, but significantly less so than in years past; for example those affected by high levels of unemployment and dereliction.|$|E
