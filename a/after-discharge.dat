50|$|There are {{multiple}} theories surrounding the neural correlates of masking, {{but most of}} them agree on a few key ideas. First, backward visual masking comes about from suppression of the target’s “after-discharge”, where the <b>after-discharge</b> {{can be thought of as}} the neural response to the target’s termination. Forward masking, on the other hand, is correlated to the suppression of the target’s “onset-response”, which can be thought of as the neural response to the target’s appearance.|$|E

It {{was revealed that}} SCs contain medium (mIK(Ca)) and slow (sIAHP) Ca 2 +-dependent K+ currents. Furthermore, {{it was determined that}} mIK(Ca) is not mediated by apamin-sensitive SK channels in SCs, whereas it was found to be is apamin-sensitive in MEC layer II non-SCs. In addition, the results indicated that mIK(Ca) and sIAHP may underlie SFA in SCs and that mIK(Ca), sIAHP and SFA are subject to inhibitory modulation by PKA-activation. Therefore, PKA modulation may be important for SCs to exhibit post-burst <b>after-discharges.</b> Future work is required to determine whether PKA modulation of MEC layer II SCs plays an important role during WM tasks...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{insecticide}} permethrin {{is generally}} considered as a rather safe compound, a number of adverse effects have been reported. Consequently, biomonitoring of exposure to permethrin is important {{in order to minimize}} health risks. We here present the first steps towards the development of a novel methodology to assess the cumulative internal dose of exposure to permethrin, which is based on our observation that (reactive) glucuronide conjugates of permethrin metabolites form persistent adducts to albumin. The pyrethroid permethrin {{is one of the most}} widely used insecticides. It is effective in the control of ticks, mites and lice, while having little adverse effects in humans. Its toxicity in insects is based on binding to sodium channels in the nervous system, leading to prolongation of the depolarizing after-potential, repetitive <b>after-discharges</b> and hyperexcitation. Permethrin has been used extensively by the allied troop...|$|R

In this work, we verified the effects of zinc chelation in an animal model of epileptogenesis induced by amygdala rapid kindling. The basolateral. amygdala was electrically stimulated ten times per day for 2 days. A single stimulus was applied on the third day. Stimulated animals received injections of PBS or the zinc chelator diethildythiocarbamate acid (DEDTC) before each stimulus series. Animals were monitored with video-EEG and were perfused 3 h after the last stimulus for subsequent neo-Timm and Ftuoro-Jade B analysis. Zinc chelation decreased the duration of both behavioral seizures and electrical <b>after-discharges,</b> and also decreased the EEG spikes frequency, without changing the progression of behavioral seizure severity.

40|$|A {{peripheral}} uniform stimulus on {{a uniform}} background tends to fade when a ring enclosing the stimulus is flashed briefly, indicating that neural signals {{external to the}} stimulus such as those from the ring or those from the background tend to inhibit the onset-response or <b>after-discharge</b> of the stimulus. In this study, a peripheral achromatic line was flashed briefly on an achromatic background while the subject was steadily fixating on a point on the background. It was predicted that the stimulus line would fade due to background inhibition of the onset-response or <b>after-discharge</b> of the stimulus. On a reference line, subjects indicated two points delimiting {{the part of the}} stimulus line which looked uniform in intensity of color. These points converged {{toward the center of the}} reference line as the luminance of the stimulus line approached that of the background. Compared to the central uniform part, the nonuniform parts near the endpoints of the stimulus line looked more faded.

40|$|Acute {{heart failure}} syndromes (AHFS) {{have emerged as}} a leading public health problem worldwide, {{accounting}} for {{a substantial number of}} hospitalizations and a high utilization of resources. Although in-hospital mortality rates are relatively low, patients with AHFS have very high early <b>after-discharge</b> mortality and rehospitalization rates.

40|$|Tonic {{inhibition}} of sensory spinal neurones {{is well known}} to descend from the rostroventral medulla. It is not clear if this inhibition is dynamically activated by peripheral noxious stimuli. Transection of the ipsilateral dorsolateral funiculus (DLF) removed a descending {{inhibition of}} multireceptive spinal neurones and disproportionally prolonged the <b>after-discharge</b> component of their response to a noxious cutaneous stimulus. Microinjection of GABA or tetracaine into the medullary nucleus gigantocellularis pars alpha (GiA) similarly prolonged the <b>after-discharge</b> in response to noxious stimuli. Recordings of GiA cells, initially using minimal surgery, revealed that many had low levels of spontaneous activity and responded vigorously to noxious stimuli applied to {{any part of the}} body surface. One hour after the surgery necessary to expose the spinal cord, GiA cells had a high firing rate but responded weakly to noxious stimuli. The response of GiA cells to noxious stimuli was abolished by transection of only the DLF contralateral to the stimulus. It is concluded that the inhibition of multireceptive dorsal horn neurones from GiA is dynamically activated by noxious cutaneous stimuli via a projection in the contralateral DLF. Surgical exposure of the spinal cord tonically activates this inhibition and masks the dynamic component...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{inhibition}} {{in control}} of plateau-generating neurones in the dorsal horn was studied in an in vitro preparation of the spinal cord of the turtle. Ionotropic and metabotropic inhibition was found to condition the expression of plateau potentials. Blockade of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) and glycine receptors by their selective antagonists bicuculline (10 - 50 μM) and strychnine (5 - 20 μM) enhanced the excitatory response to stimulation of the dorsal root and facilitated the expression of plateau potentials. Bicuculline and strychnine also facilitated the generation of plateau potentials in response to depolarizing current pulses, suggesting the presence of tonic ionotropic inhibitory mechanisms in turtle spinal cord slices. Activation of GABAB receptors also inhibited plateau-generating neurones. The selective agonist baclofen (5 - 50 μM) inhibited wind-up of the response to repeated depolarizations induced synaptically or by intracellular current pulses. Baclofen reduced afferent synaptic input. This effect was not affected by bicuculline or strychnine and was blocked by the selective GABAB receptor antagonist 2 -hydroxysaclofen (2 -OH-saclofen, 100 - 400 μM). Postsynaptically, baclofen inhibited plateau properties. Activation of GABAB receptors produced a hyperpolarization (7. 0 ± 0. 5 mV, mean ± s. e. m., n= 29) with an associated decrease in input resistance (22. 7 ± 3. 1 %, n= 24). These effects were blocked by extracellular Ba 2 + (1 - 2 mM). When the baclofen-induced hyperpolarization and shunt were compensated for by adjusting the bias current {{and the strength of}} the stimulus, baclofen still inhibited generation of plateau potentials. Wind-up and <b>after-discharges</b> were also inhibited by baclofen. These effects remained in the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 μM) and were antagonized by 2 -OH-saclofen. The inhibition of plateau properties was observed even when the baclofen-induced hyperpolarization and shunt were blocked by Ba 2 + and when potassium channels were blocked by Ba 2 + (3 mM), tetraethylammonium (TEA, 15 mM) and apamin (0. 25 - 0. 5 μM). The baclofen-sensitive component of the plateau potential was reduced by nifedipine (10 μM), suggesting a modulation of postsynaptic L-type Ca 2 + channels. We suggest that inhibitory regulation of plateau properties plays a role in somatosensory processing in the dorsal horn. The inhibitory control of wind-up and <b>after-discharges</b> may be particularly significant in physiological and therapeutic control of central sensitization to pain...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that spinal lamina I neurons with ascending axons that project to the midbrain {{play a crucial role}} in hyperalgesia. To test this hypothesis the quantitative properties of lamina I spinoparabrachial neurons in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain were compared to those of unoperated and sham-operated controls. Behavioural testing showed that animals with a CCI exhibited heat hyperalgesia within 4 days of the injury, and this hyperalgesia persisted throughout the 14 -day post-operative testing period. In the CCI, nociceptive lamina I spinoparabrachial neurons had heat thresholds that were significantly lower than controls (43. 0 ± 2. 8 °C vs. 46. 7 ± 2. 6 °C; P < 10 − 4, ANOVA). Nociceptive lamina I spinoparabrachial neurons were also significantly more responsive to graded heat stimuli in the CCI, compared to controls (P < 0. 02, 2 -factor repeated-measures ANOVA), and increased <b>after-discharges</b> were also observed. Furthermore, the heat-evoked stimulus–response functions of lamina I spinoparabrachial neurons in CCI animals co-varied significantly (P < 0. 03, ANCOVA) with the amplitude of heat hyperalgesia determined behaviourally. Taken together these results are consistent with the hypothesis that lamina I spinoparabrachial neurons have an important mechanistic role in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{impairment}} of consciousness (IOC) induced by electrical cortical stimulation (ECS) of homologous regions within the lateral frontal convexities in a patient with medically intractable epilepsy. The patient had mixed features of idiopathic generalized and focal epilepsy. On intracranial EEG recording, interictal and ictal discharges showed {{a high degree of}} synchrony across widespread bilateral fronto-parietal areas. We identified regions in the lateral frontal lobes that reliably and produced loss of consciousness by ECS. This was accompanied by evoked EEG activity of admixed frequencies over the fronto-parietal, mesial frontal and temporal regions during stimulation and was not associated with <b>after-discharges.</b> Symptoms were immediately reversible upon cessation of stimulation. This finding suggests that focal cortical stimulation can disrupt widespread networks that underlie consciousness. Individuals with high degrees of speculated thalamo-frontal cortical connectivity might be more susceptible to this effect, and the findings highlight the importance of standardizing the testing of level of consciousness during mapping sessions. Although consciousness is commonly impaired in epileptic seizures, limited literature is available on loss of consciousness induced by electrical cortical stimulation (ECS) in humans undergoing intracranial EEG evaluations for localization of epileptic focus. One theory advocates the presence of consciousness ‘switch’ in subcortical structures. While this model is novel and simplistic, it has its inherent limitations. In this case study, we propose an alternative approach on the entity and discuss the complex circuits underlying it and correlate that with the electrophysiological findings and the pathophysiology of the phenotype of the disease and discuss potential causes for rarity of reports on the subject...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Excitation-contraction {{coupling}} {{was characterized}} in scorpion striated muscle fibers using standard microelectrode techniques as employed in studies on vertebrate skeletal muscle. The action potential of scorpion muscle {{consists of two}} phases of regenerative activity. A relatively fast, overshooting initial spike {{is followed by a}} prolonged <b>after-discharge</b> of smaller, repetitive spikes. This <b>after-discharge</b> is accompanied by a twitch that relaxes promptly upon repolarization. Twitches fail in Na-free, tetrodotoxin (TTX) -containing, or Ca-free media. However, caffeine causes contractures in muscles paralyzed by Na- and Ca-free solutions. Experiments on muscle fibers voltage-clamped at a point with two microelectrodes in Na-free or TTX-containing media indicate that: (a) the strength-duration relation for threshold contractions has a shape similar to that in frog muscle, but mean values are displaced- 20 mV in the positive direction; (b) tetracaine exerts a parallel effect on strength-duration curves from scorpion and frog; (c) contractile activation in scorpion is abolished in Ca-free media; and (d) the contractile threshold is highly correlated with the occurrence of inward Ca current for pulses of all durations. Thus, the voltage dependence of contractile activation in scorpion and frog muscle is similar. However, the preparations differ in their dependence on extracellular Ca for contraction. These results are discussed in relation to possible mechanisms coupling tubular depolarization to Ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in vertebrate and invertebrate skeletal muscle...|$|E

40|$|The {{synchronization}} {{among the}} activities of neural populations in functional regions {{is one of the}} most important electrophysiological phenomena in epileptic brains. The spatiotemporal dynamics of phase synchronization was investigated to reveal the reciprocal interaction between different functional regions during epileptogenesis. Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded simultaneously from the basolateral amygdala (BLA), the cornu ammonis 1 of hippocampus (CA 1) and the mediodorsal nucleus of thalamus (MDT) in the mouse amygdala-kindling models during the development of epileptic seizures. The synchronization of LFPs was quantified between BLA, CA 1 and MDT using phase-locking value (PLV). During amygdala kindling, behavioral changes (from stage 0 to stage 5) of mice were accompanied by <b>after-discharges</b> (ADs) of similar waveforms appearing almost simultaneously in CA 1, MDT, as well as BLA. AD durations were positively related to the intensity of seizures. During seizures at stages 1 ~ 2, PLVs remained relatively low and increased dramatically shortly after the termination of the seizures; by contrast, for stages 3 ~ 5, PLVs remained a relatively low level during the initial period but increased dramatically before the seizure termination. And in the theta band, the degree of PLV enhancement was positively associated with seizure intensity. The results suggested that during epileptogenesis, the functional regions were kept desynchronized rather than hyper-synchronized during either the initial or the entire period of the seizures; so different dynamic patterns of phase synchronization may be involved in different periods of the epileptogenesis, and this might also reflect that during seizures at different stages, the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of phase synchronization were different...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of sets of motor fibres responding to both clockwise and anticlockwise rotation {{have been studied}} in the oculomotor nerve of the rock lobster. There are probably three, but perhaps four, units in each set. None of these fibres has statocyst input, but there is weak input onto the tonic fibres from the antennal joints such that the eye turns in the direction toward which the antenna points. Many preparations show bilateral visual input onto all fibres but the degree of coupling between the eyes is very variable, and at times can be nearly totally absent. Depending on the speed of rotation the fibres show a gradual build-up in frequency, during rotation in the preferred direction, interrupted by flipbacks. During the fast stage of the resulting nystagmic movements all agonistic fibres can be completely inhibited and all antagonistic ones can be activated, usually {{for a period of}} about 0. 5 sec. Fibre activity is demonstrated which appears to underlie an ‘optokinetic memory’ of contrasting target position in the visual field. It consists of (a) very prolonged <b>after-discharges</b> for a stationary striped pattern (b) resumption of discharges at an appropriate frequency after dark periods up to 2 min, and (c) adjustment of such frequencies to changes in stripe position during the dark period.

40|$|The {{effects of}} Cs+ {{on the action}} potential, post-train after-hyperpolarization (AHP), Ca 2 +-dependent post-spike depolarizing after-potential (DAP) and phasic firing were {{examined}} during intracellular recordings from magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) in superfused rat hypothalamic explants. Extracellular Cs+ reversibly inhibited (IC 50, ≈ 1 mM) DAPs, and associated <b>after-discharges,</b> that followed brief spike trains in each of sixteen cells tested. Although bath application of Cs+ also provoked a small reversible depolarization, inhibition of the DAP was retained when membrane voltage was kept constant by current injection. Application of Cs+ had no significant effects on spike duration (n = 8), frequency-dependent spike broadening (n = 8), spike hyperpolarizing after-potentials (n = 14), or the amplitude of the isolated AHP (n = 7). Caesium-evoked inhibition of the DAP, therefore, does not result from diminished spike-evoked Ca 2 + influx, and may reflect direct blockade of the conductance underlying the DAP. Inhibition of the DAP was associated with an enhancement of the amplitude and duration of the AHP, indicating that the currents underlying the AHP and the DAP overlap in time following a train of action potentials, and that the relative magnitude of these currents {{is an important factor}} in determining the shape and time course of post-train after-potentials. Bath application of Cs+ reversibly abolished phasic firing in each of seven cells tested. This effect was reversible and persisted at all subthreshold voltages tested.

40|$|Caloric {{restriction}} (CR) {{has been}} shown to possess antiepileptic properties; however its mechanism of action is poorly understood. CR might inhibit the activity of the mammalian or mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascade, which seems to participate crucially in the generation of epilepsy. Thus, we investigated the effect of CR on the mTOR pathway and whether CR modified epilepsy generation due to electrical amygdala kindling. The former was studied by analyzing the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, protein kinase B and the ribosomal protein S 6. The mTOR cascade is regulated by energy and by insulin levels, both of which may be changed by CR; thus we investigated if CR altered the levels of energy substrates in the blood or the level of insulin in plasma. Finally, we studied if CR modified the expression of genes that encode proteins participating in the mTOR pathway. CR increased the <b>after-discharge</b> threshold and tended to reduce the <b>after-discharge</b> duration, indicating an anti-convulsive action. CR diminished the phosphorylation of protein kinase B and ribosomal protein S 6, suggesting an inhibition of the mTOR cascade. However, CR did not change glucose, β-hydroxybutyrate or insulin levels; thus the effects of CR were independent from them. Interestingly, CR also did not modify the expression of any investigated gene. The results suggest that the anti-epileptic effect of CR may be partly due to inhibition of the mTOR pathway...|$|E

No long-latency spike responses were evoked in response to C fibre stimulation in pups at postnatal day 3 (P 3) or P 6, while by P 10, 35 % of cells had a C fibre response. Latencies of response to A fibre skin stimulation were very long and varied widely in the youngest animals, particularly in superficial cells, but mean latencies decreased with postnatal age, from 33. 1 ± 2. 78 ms at P 3 to 7. 3 ± 0. 3 ms at P 21. The mean number of spikes evoked by a single A fibre skin stimulus was remarkably consistent between cells and not significantly different in superficial and deep laminae at each age. The mean value of 5. 1 ± 0. 6 at P 3 increased to 7. 0 ± 1. 4 at P 10. Repeated stimulation of cutaneous A fibres at 0. 5 Hz at twice the threshold level did not significantly alter {{the magnitude of the}} evoked response but led to shifts in latency, or ‘latency jitter’, which decreased with age. Deeper cells displayed more latency jitter than superficial cells. Repeated stimulation of cutaneous A fibres at 0. 5 Hz at twice the threshold level produced considerable sensitization in a population of dorsal horn cells in the neonate. This sensitization was unlike the classic C fibre-evoked ‘wind-up’ observed in adult dorsal horn. The direct A fibre-evoked activity did not increase, but the background activity increased during repetitive stimulation leading to a prolonged <b>after-discharge</b> beyond the stimulation period. At P 6, 33 % of cells were sensitized, displaying a mean <b>after-discharge</b> of 70. 6 ± 18 s. At P 10, only 6 % were sensitized, with a mean <b>after-discharge</b> of 63 s, and by P 21, sensitization was no longer observed.

40|$|Whereas the {{selective}} toxicity of insecticides between insects and mammals {{has a long}} history of studies, it is now becoming abundantly clear that, in many cases, the differential action of insecticides on insects and mamma-lian target receptor sites is an important factor. In this paper, we first introduce the mechanism of action and {{the selective}} toxicity of pyrethroids as a prototype of study. Then, a more detailed account is given for fipronil, based primarily on our recent studies. Pyrethroids keep the sodium channels open for a prolonged period of time, causing elevation of the depolarizing after-potential. Once the after-potential reaches the threshold for excita-tion, repetitive <b>after-discharges</b> are produced, resulting in hyperexcitation of intoxicated animals. Only about 1 % of sodium channels needs to be modified to produce hyperexcitation, indicating a high degree of toxicity amplification from sodium channels to animals. Pyre-throids were / 1000 -fold more potent on cockroach sodium channels than rat sodium channels, and this forms the most significant factor to explain the selective toxicity of pyrethroids in insects over mammals. Fipronil, a phenylpyrazole, is known to act on the g-aminobutyric acid receptor to block the chloride channel. It is effective against certain species of insects that have become resistant to most insecticides, including those acting on the g-aminobutyric acid receptor, and is much more toxic to insects than to mammals. Recently, fipronil has been found to block glutamate-activated chloride channels in cockroach neurons in a potent manner. Since mammals are devoid of this type of chloride channel, fipronil block of the glutamate-activated chloride channel is deemed responsible, at least partially, for the higher selective toxicity to insects over mammals and for the lack of cross...|$|R

The mechanisms behind bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy (BIPN) and CIPN overall are largely unknown. Recent findings in other pain models have indicated substantial involvement of glial cells in chronic pain. Although injury models have shown activation of both astrocytes and microglia following insult, research in other CIPN models has shown astrocytic activation in the absence of microglial activation. The central hypothesis of this dissertation is that the activity of astrocytes is correlated with behavioral changes observed in a rat model of BIPN in a manner that may directly contribute to these changes in behavior. To investigate this, the work of this dissertation 1) established the multimodal changes to behavior and showed increases in spinal neuron firing in BIPN, 2) quantified activity of astrocytes and whether changes were prevented by minocycline, an anti-inflammatory drug that vi prevents glial activation, and 3) quantified changes in connexin 43, GLT- 1, and GLAST to assess whether astrocytic glutamate transport may be altered in BIPN. The results observed in the first aim were that the rat BIPN model is characterized by selective mechanical hypersensitivity and a significant increase in wide dynamic range (WDR) neuron firing rates and <b>after-discharges.</b> In the second aim, astrocytes in the BIPN model were activated in a manner that paralleled the behavioral changes. Animals co-treated with minocycline resembled saline-treated animals in both astrocytic activation and behaviors. The results in the third aim were that astrocytic gap junctions were increased and GLAST expression was decreased at the height of mechanical sensitivity. Minocycline-treated animals resembled saline-treated animals in expression of these proteins, as well. The overall conclusion was that astrocyte activity closely paralleled behaviors in the BIPN model in a manner that may be explained by their role in glutamate trafficking...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} on anaesthetized cats to investigate the receptive properties of regenerated cutaneous tibial nerve nociceptors, and to obtain evidence for coupling between them and other afferent fibres as being possible peripheral mechanisms involved in neuropathic pain. These properties were studied 6 - 7 months after nerve section and repair. Recordings were made from 25 regenerated nociceptors; 14 were A fibres and the remainder were C fibres. Their receptive field sizes and conduction velocities were similar to controls. There {{was no significant difference}} between their mechanical thresholds and those of a control population of nociceptors. Regenerated nociceptors were significantly more responsive to suprathreshold mechanical stimuli than were uninjured control fibres. This increase in mechanical sensitivity occurred in both A and C fibres, although A fibres showed a greater increase in mechano-sensitivity than C fibres. Over half of the regenerated nociceptors (13 / 25) showed <b>after-discharge</b> to mechanical stimuli which was never seen in controls; the mean firing rate during this period of <b>after-discharge</b> was significantly related to both stimulus intensity and stimulus area. There {{was no significant difference between}} the heat encoding properties of regenerated nociceptors and control nociceptors. Cold sensitivity was similarly unchanged. Thus, abnormal peripheral sprouting was unlikely to account for the increased mechanical sensitivity of the regenerated fibres. None of the regenerated nociceptors were found to be coupled to other fibres. These results suggest that the clinical observation of mechanical hyperalgesia in patients after nerve injury may have a peripheral basis. Based on this model, other signs of neuropathic pain (i. e. tactile or thermal allodynia) are more likely to be due to altered central processing...|$|E
40|$|Androgens, ageing and {{vascular}} function We {{will never}} be perfect in achieving a diagnosis in every patient, {{and the challenge of}} geriatrics is how difficult it can be in some patients, and indeed, whether it is appropriate in others. An audit of our own ill-defined diagnoses showed that re-admission rates, at 1 month, were 10 %, very similar to our better defined patients, and the great majority did not return to hospital within the next year. But that should not make us complacent. Walsh’s paper should make us all reflect upon the systems that operate for our older people, and the continuum of care from the front door to <b>after-discharge,</b> including the information (clinical and managerial) that goes along with it.

40|$|Controversy exists {{concerning}} {{the role that}} dopamine plays in analgesia. In the present studies, dopamine agonists produced analgesia, and D-amphetamine potentiated morphine analgesia, while treatment with 6 -hydroxydopamine or mixed or selective D 1 and D 2 dopamine receptor antagonists attenuated or abolished morphine and D-amphetamine-induced analgesia, in the formalin test. Furthermore, microinjection of morphine into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and ventral striatum produced analgesia, while intra-VTA microinjection of naloxone methylbromide antagonized the analgesia produced by systemic morphine, in the formalin test. In contrast, similar manipulations of dopamine {{had little or no}} effect in the tail flick test. Thus, dopamine appears to play a facilitatory role in formalin test analgesia, and there appear to be fundamental differences between the formalin and tail flick tests and parallels between the role of dopamine in the formalin test and in clinical pain, the vocalization <b>after-discharge</b> test and reward...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{norepinephrine}} in {{the development}} of amygdaloid kindling in rats was investigated. In the first experiment, pretreatment with the noradrenergic neurotoxin, DSP- 4 (63 mg/kg, ip), whose action is reportedly specific to locus coeruleus neurons, markedly accelerated the rate of kindling. DSP- 4 treated animals and saline controls required 3. 8 and 7. 5 <b>after-discharges</b> (ADs) to kindle respectively. Furthermore, DSP- 4 treatment lengthened the latency of the onset to clonus during the first stage 5 seizure. Norepinephrine levels measured in the telencephalon were lowered by 45 % with DSP- 4 treatment, whereas dopamine and 5 -hydroxytryptamine levels were unaffected. [...] In an attempt to test the hypothesis that a tonic presence of norepinephrine serves to inhibit kindling development, rats were treated with DSP- 4, and chronically infused (icv) with either norepinephrine (5 ug/. 5 ul/hr), or the vehicle, via an osmotic minipump. Telencephalic norepinephrine levels were not raised by the infusion of norepinephrine, and consequently {{there were no significant differences}} between the two groups on kindling development. Both infusion groups were combined and compared to those groups in experiment 1.

Three groups were given DSP- 4 treatment and 1 group saline. One DSP- 4 group received chronic ventricular infusion of norepinephrine (10 ug/. 5 ul/hr -double that in experiment 2) and another the vehicle alone. Once again the infusion of norepinephrine failed to raise norepinephrine levels above the vehicle control; however the infused groups had norepinephrine levels equivalent to the saline (non-infused) control. Despite a marked amount of within group variance, the DSP- 4 alone group had a significant reduction of norepinephrine, and all three DSP- 4 treated groups kindled significantly faster than the saline group. These results imply that: 1) initial abnormalities induced by DSP- 4 were reversed during kindling, 2) the cannulation and/or vehicle infusion procedure itself accelerates kindling, or 3) norepinephrine depletion may not be necessary for kindling acceleration induced by DSP- 4 treatment.

40|$|Summary: The {{effect of}} {{increased}} brain GABA levels on fully kindled amyg-dala seizures {{was investigated in}} Long-Evans rats. The newly synthesized GABA-transaminase inhibitor, y-acetylenic GABA (GAG) administered on four consecutive days (100 mg/kg, followed by 50 mg/kg, i. p.) was found to either significantly reduce, or eliminate entirely, the behavioral seizures nor-mally produced by amygdala stimulation. The effect is seen after the first injection of GAG although its magnitude was greater on subsequent days. Behavioral seizures reappeared 2 to 3 days after termination of GAG treat-ment. The duration of electrographic seizures (self-sustained amygdala <b>after-discharge)</b> was either unchanged or greater {{on the first day}} of GAG treatment, but was briefer on subsequent days. The duration of afterdischarges returned to normal levels 1 to 2 days earlier than the behavioral seizures after the termination of GAG. Picrotoxin (1. 5 - 2 mg/kg, i. p.) did not antagonize either electrographic or behavioral effects of inhibition produced with GAG.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of treatment with water, n-butanol and ether extracts of Hypercom perforatum L. on epileptogenesis in rabbits. Animals from the control group received solvent-ethanol, and the kindling model of epilepsy was used. Epileptic focus was induced in Chinchilla rabbits by stimulation of the hippocampus. The following parameters were determined: the minimum current strength necessary to induce <b>after-discharge</b> (AD) – discharges appearing after cessation of stimulation; AD duration; the number of stimulations necessary to induce spontaneous kindling; and the latency time for the development of full kindling. The results obtained indicate that epileptogenesis is influenced by Hypericum perforatum L. extract treatment. Animals treated with an ether extract of Hypericum perforatum L. required significantly weaker minimum current strengths for the development of epileptogenic focus, and displayed longer AD times, while the number of electro-stimulations necessary for full kindling was less. In contrast, animals treated with water and n-butanol extracts required increased electro-stimulations for the development of epileptic discharge, and displayed shortened AD durations versus controls...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{theory of}} {{kindling}} {{may help to}} link neurophysiologic, neu rotransmitt er and neuroanatomic mechanisms important in understanding th e neurology of behav-ior. Lim bic kindling is of interest in developing model s of epilepsy, psychosis, learning and memory (l- 5). Kindling might explain the late development of psychopathology. This paper will first define kindling and demonstrate how kindling offers a model within which to view more prolonged behavioral deviations as neurophysiologica l proces ses. The use of carbamazepine and its association to kindling, tempora l lobe dysfunction and psychopathology will be discussed.

40|$|A B S T R A C T Introduction: Epilepsy is {{a chronic}} {{neurological}} disorder in which patients experience spontaneous recurrent seizures. Although {{the most commonly}} recommended therapy is drug treatment, some patients do not achieve adequate control of their seizures on existing drugs. New medications with novel mechanisms of action are needed to help those patients whose seizures are resistant to currently-available drugs. Therefore, the anti-convulsant effect of a high dose of quercetin was evaluated in amygdala kindling model in male rats.  Methods: Rats were divided into sham-operated group, quercetintreated SH, kindled, and quercetin-treated kindled rats. Quercetin was administered i. p. one day before amygdale kindling for 3 weeks (40 mg/kg/day). The parameters seizure stage, AD duration, the latency to the onset of stage 4, and the duration of stage 5 were analyzed.  Results: The results showed that quercetin pretreatment causes a lower seizure intensity in treated kindled rats (p< 0. 05 - 0. 01), a lower <b>after-discharge</b> duration (p< 0. 05 - 0. 01), and a higher latency to stage IV (p< 0. 05) as compared to untreated kindled ones.  Discussion: To conclude, chronic administration of quercetin inhibits amygdala electrical kindling and more studies are warranted to clarify its underlying mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Different animal {{models are}} used to {{evaluate}} the process of epileptogenesis. In this investigation the kindling model of epilepsy was used. The epileptic focus was induced in Chinchilla rabbits by stimulation of the hippocampus with electric stimuli. We presumed that the extracts of Ginkgo biloba affect the formation of kindling epilepsy. Bioelectric activity of the brain was registered throughout the development of kindling with and without standardized extracts from dried ginkgo leaves (EGb 761). For each animal the following has been determined: the values of the minimum current strength necessary for the origination of threshold <b>after-discharge</b> (AD) Ã¢Â€Â“ discharges appearing after the cessation of stimulation; duration of the threshold AD; number of stimulations necessary for the origination of full kindling; time latency for the development of full kindling; number of spontaneous epileptogenic discharges manifested in EEG two days following the formation of full kindling during 60 -minute registration. The results show that the process of epileptogenesis was influenced by EGb 761. It has been established that if the animals received EGb 761, significantly weaker minimum current strength was necessary {{for the development of the}} epileptogenic focus and the AD were longer, while the number of necessary electrostimulations for the appearance of full kindling was less and the latency was shorter...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of tolerance to therapeutic effects of antiepileptic drugs {{can be a}} problem in the treatment of epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and pain syndromes. In the present study, acute treatment with the new antiepileptic drug lamotrigine (LTG, 15 mg/kg) markedly suppressed seizure stage and seizure duration in amygdala-kindled rats; but this antiseizure effect was rapidly lost following 4 - 8 days of repeated treatment. When gabapentin (GBP, 20 mg/kg) was coadministered with LTG, the ability of LTG to suppress seizure stage, seizure duration, and <b>after-discharge</b> (AD) duration was markedly extended. In addition, GBP coadministration with LTG decreased the number of animals that developed LTG-related running fits (Stage 6 seizures) and lengthened the number of days required to develop running fits or complete tolerance. Neither acute nor repeated treatment with MK- 801 (0. 3 mg/kg), a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, had effects on kindled seizures. However, cotreatment with MK- 801 markedly extended the anticonvulsant effects of LTG on the three seizure indices and reduced running fits. These data indicate that cotreatment with either GBP or MK- 801 slows tolerance development to the anticonvulsant effects of LTG on kindled seizures.

40|$|Chronic neuropathic pain affects {{millions}} of individuals worldwide, is typically long-lasting, and remains poorly treated with existing therapies. Neuropathic pain arising from peripheral nerve lesions {{is known to}} be dependent on the emergence of spontaneous and evoked hyperexcitability in damaged nerves. Here, we report that the potassium channel subunit Kv 9. 1 is expressed in myelinated sensory neurons, but is absent from small unmyelinated neurons. Kv 9. 1 expression was strongly and rapidly downregulated following axotomy, with a time course that matches the development of spontaneous activity and pain hypersensitivity in animal models. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated knock-down of Kv 9. 1 in naive rats led to neuropathic pain behaviors. Diminished Kv 9. 1 function also augmented myelinated sensory neuron excitability, manifested as spontaneous firing, hyper-responsiveness to stimulation, and persistent <b>after-discharge.</b> Intracellular recordings from ex vivo dorsal root ganglion preparations revealed that Kv 9. 1 knock-down was linked to lowered firing thresholds and increased firing rates under physiologically relevant conditions of extracellular potassium accumulation during prolonged activity. Similar neurophysiological changes were detected in animals subjected to traumatic nerve injury and provide an explanation for neuropathic pain symptoms, including poorly understood conditions such as hyperpathia and paresthesias. In summary, our results demonstrate that Kv 9. 1 dysfunction leads to spontaneous and evoked neuronal hyperexcitability in myelinated fibers, coupled with development of neuropathic pain behaviors...|$|E
