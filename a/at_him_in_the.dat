500|$|The second episode {{introduces}} the new navigating officer Lieutenant Sam Quartermaine (played by Adam Rayner) and a subplot involving {{his relationship with}} LMA Anita Cook (played by Angel Coulby) runs through the series and is eventually discovered by Lieutenant James Maguire, the Principal Warfare Officer (played by Stephen Kennedy). Terry [...] "Buffer" [...] Duncan's (played by Geoff Bell) career is in jeopardy when an accusation of assault is thrown <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third episode, while Leading Regulator Liz Wilson (played by Diane Beck) develops an unreciprocated crush on Bowen.

500|$|Following {{his career}} with the Greyhounds, Vanbiesbrouck moved on to the minor leagues joining the Central Hockey League's (CHL) Tulsa Oilers. [...] During the 1983-84 season, his first with the Oilers, the {{ownership}} group was unable to sustain the team. [...] They went bankrupt, were taken over by the league, and forced to play their remaining games on the road. [...] After losing their home rink the team was housed in Denver, Colorado where they shared a practice facility with the University of Denver and fellow CHL team the Colorado Flames. [...] The lack of ice time often forced the Oilers to practice in a Mall where they were not allowed to shoot pucks. [...] For extra practice Vanbiesbrouck had tennis balls hit <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> parking lot. [...] Despite all the adversity the Oilers won the Adams Cup as league champions. Meanwhile, Vanbiesbrouck won the Terry Sawchuk Award, with back-up Ron Scott, for fewest goals against in the league and shared CHL MVP honors with Bruce Affleck by winning the Tommy Ivan Trophy.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy's {{campaign}} {{staff was}} disorganized and Kennedy was initially an ineffective campaigner. The Chappaquiddick incident {{emerged as a}} more significant issue than the staff had expected, with several newspaper columnists and editorials criticizing Kennedy's answers on the matter. In the January 1980 Iowa caucuses that initiated the primaries season, Carter demolished Kennedy by a 59–31 percent margin. Kennedy's fundraising immediately declined and his campaign had to downsize, but he remained defiant, saying [...] " [...] we'll see {{who is going to}} whip whose what." [...] Nevertheless, Kennedy lost three New England contests. Kennedy did form a more coherent message about why he was running, saying at Georgetown University: [...] "I believe we must not permit the dream of social progress to be shattered by those whose premises have failed." [...] However, concerns over Chappaquiddick and issues related to personal character prevented Kennedy from gaining the support of many people who were disillusioned with Carter. During a St. Patrick's Day Parade in Chicago, Kennedy had to wear a bullet-proof vest due to assassination threats, and hecklers yelled [...] "Where's Mary Jo?" [...] <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> key March 18 primary in Illinois, Kennedy failed to gain the support of Catholic voters, and Carter crushed him, winning 155 of 169 delegates.|$|E

500|$|Casablanca Records {{commissioned}} a music video {{to be directed}} by Jake Nava, who previously worked {{in the same year}} with Britney Spears on her music video for [...] "My Prerogative" [...] (2004). The music video for [...] "Rumors" [...] premiered on October 14, 2004 and October 20, 2004 through Disney Channel and MTV. In the beginning of the video, Lohan is followed by paparazzi as she is entering her car. It is revealed that this is a Lindsay-look-alike, and that the real Lohan is entering another car to go to a club. The car comes to a stop, and she then steps into an elevator and sings the first verse of the song, while she is filmed by a CCTV camera in the elevator. The next sequence shows her running through a hallway, dressed up, before getting into the club. There, she dances in the crowd, where she takes a picture of one of the paparazzi herself to get back <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> next sequence, she is walking slowly through the club where she finds the man who seems to be her boyfriend. She takes a seat next to her lover and they begin kissing and touching each other, all the while being constantly filmed by cameras in the club. While Lohan sings the second chorus, she is trapped in a cage {{in the middle of the}} club and the whole crowd is watching her. After this Lohan is shown dancing in the club with her friends. At the end of the music video Lohan and her friends enter the top of a high-rise and perform a dance routine while helicopters are circling around them. Finally Lohan gets into a helicopter and escapes. In the end, she throws her camera away with all the pictures taken of her.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{autobiography}} A Chef's Tale, Pierre Franey relates how when Voronoff dined at Le Pavillon in the 1940s, waiters would remark how [...] "he {{looked like a}} monkey himself, with his exceptionally long fingers and slouching walk. They would laugh <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kitchen and imitate his walk {{for those of us}} (in the kitchen) who couldn't witness it ourselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{historian}} Gordon S. Wood {{says that}} Lance Banning, {{as in his}} Sacred Fire of Liberty (1995), is the [...] "only present-day scholar to maintain that Madison did not change his views in the 1790s." [...] In claiming this, Banning downplays Madison's nationalism in the 1780s. Wood notes that many historians struggle to understand Madison, but Wood looks <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> terms of Madison's own times—as a nationalist but one with a different conception of nationalism {{from that of the}} Federalists. He wanted to avoid a European-style government and always thought that the embargo would ultimately have been successful. Thus, Wood assesses Madison from a different point of view. Gary Rosen and Banning use other approaches to suggest Madison's consistency.|$|E
2500|$|Botha {{began his}} career as an {{ordinary}} medium pacer for the Eastern Cape Warriors - by his own admission quicker than 125km/h. [...] It was only after Mickey Arthur, the former coach of the national team, had a look <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nets and saw potential as a spinner that Botha dropped his ambitions for speed. Spurred on by Arthur's comments that he would do well to turn to spin, Botha remodeled his action and began studying the art of the off spinner and doosra in hopes of emulating the likes of Muttiah Muralitharan and Harbhajan Singh. A successful tour of Sri Lanka with the South Africa A side - in which he took key wickets as well as scoring runs - saw Botha's name penciled in as a potential spinning all-rounder.|$|E

2500|$|On September 5, 1975, Charles Manson Family cult member Lynette [...] "Squeaky" [...] Fromme {{attempted}} to kill United States President Gerald Ford in Sacramento, California. She {{wanted to make}} a statement to people who refused to halt environmental pollution and its effects on Air, Trees, Water, and Animals (ATWA). Although Fromme stood a little more than an arm's length from Ford that Friday morning and pointed a M1911 pistol <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> public grounds of the California State Capitol building, her gun failed to fire and no one was injured. After the assassination attempt, Ford continued to walk to the California state house, where he met with California governor Jerry Brown. For her crime, Fromme spent 34 years in prison and was released on August 14, 2009 – two years and seven months after Ford's death. The Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan, later received the M1911 pistol used in the assassination attempt as a gift, and the gun was put on display.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the final}} day, 3 wickets {{from each of}} Dominic Cork and Muttiah Muralitharan helped dismiss Worcestershire for 191 runs, with David Wigley unable to bat because of a broken hand {{sustained}} when James Anderson bowled a beamer <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first innings. After the match Cork talking about his match performance of 7 for 115 said, [...] "The ball is coming out well at the moment. I've worked hard with Mike Watkinson over the winter with it. It's early season and these sort of conditions suit a bowler like myself." [...] Watkinson, in response, spoke of Lancashire's determination to get straight back into the first Division after the disappointment of relegation last season, [...] ""We talked about {{the start of the}} season and the need to start well and to get a positive number in the wins column is a good feeling. We have two home games now coming up against Derbyshire and Durham and maybe we can kick on from here." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood concurred, {{adding that}} [...] "he general public would be {{astonished}} and appalled if in those circumstances the law attached liability {{for the death}} only to the gunman who actually fired the fatal shot." [...] He did, however, consider Gnango guilty as a principal. Lord Clarke of Stone-cum-Ebony agreed that Gnango was guilty as a principal. Lord Dyson concurred with the leading judgment and would have restored [...] "the conviction {{on the basis that}} the jury must have been satisfied that the respondent aided and abetted the murder of Ms Pniewska by encouraging Bandana Man to shoot <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> course of the planned shootout". Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore gave the only dissenting judgment. He would have dismissed the Crown's appeal on the basis that [...] "there was no occasion for the [...] to consider whether the requisite intention on the part of Gnango to found a verdict of guilty on the basis of aiding and abetting was present" [...] and that Gnango could not have been guilty as a joint principal.|$|E

2500|$|Around this time, Ranjitsinhji {{began to}} work with Daniel Hayward, a {{first-class}} cricketer {{and the father of}} future England batsman Thomas Hayward, on his batting technique. His main fault was a tendency to back away from the ball when facing a fast bowler, making it more likely he would be dismissed. Possibly prompted by the suggestion of a professional cricketer who was bowling <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nets at Cambridge, he and Hayward began to practise with Ranjitsinhji's right leg tied to the ground. This affected his future batting technique and contributed to his creation of the leg glance, a shot with which he afterwards became associated. While practising, he continued to move his left leg, which was not tied, away from the ball; in this case, it moved to his right, towards point. He found he could then flick the ball behind his legs, a highly unorthodox shot and likely, for most players, to result in their dismissal. Although other players had probably played this shot before, [...] Ranjitsinhji was able to play it with unprecedented effectiveness. Ranjitsinhji probably developed his leg glance with Hayward around spring 1892, for during the remainder of that year, he scored around 2,000 runs in all cricket, far more than he had previously managed, making at least nine centuries, a feat he had never previously achieved in England.|$|E
2500|$|Editors Bryant and Springer suggest {{perception}} {{is a central}} theme, the difficulty of seeing and understanding, which makes deep reality hard to discover and truth hard to pin down. Ahab explains that, like all things, the evil whale wears a disguise: [...] "All visible objects, man, are but pasteboard masks" [...] — and Ahab is determined to [...] "strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside, except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that wall" [...] (Ch. 36, [...] "The Quarter-Deck"). This theme pervades the novel, perhaps never so emphatically as in [...] "The Doubloon" [...] (Ch. 99), where each crewmember perceives the coin in a way shaped by his own personality. Later, the American edition has Ahab [...] "discover no sign" [...] (Ch. 133) of the whale when he is staring into the deep. In fact, Moby Dick is then swimming up <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> British edition, Melville changed the word [...] "discover" [...] to [...] "perceive", and with good reason, for [...] "discovery" [...] means finding what is already there, but [...] "perceiving", or better still, perception, is [...] "a matter of shaping what exists by {{the way in which}} we see it". The point is not that Ahab would discover the whale as an object, but that he would perceive it as a symbol of his making.|$|E
2500|$|From 2010 and 2011, Game {{released}} several free-to-download mixtapes, {{partly in}} order to act as promotion for the album. The first of these mixtapes, The Red Room, was released on April 26, 2010. The mixtape was originally intended to be hosted by DJ Drama, as a [...] "Gangsta Grillz" [...] project: however, he cancelled his participation in the project after hearing several of the disses aimed <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> freestyle track titled [...] "400 Bars", {{and was replaced by}} long-time Game collaborator DJ Skee. The aforementioned [...] "400 Bars", a 20-minute-long freestyle over four-hundred consecutive bars of music (over the production of the Jay Electronica song titled [...] "Exhibit C") was later only included on the mixtape in a remixed form, titled [...] "The Skeemix". Game admitted it was the hardest freestyle he had ever had to record, having previously recorded [...] "300 Bars" [...] and [...] "360 Bars" [...] for previous mixtapes. The tape featured guest appearances from Nipsey Hussle, Lil Wayne, Birdman, Kanary Diamonds, Busta Rhymes, Bizzy Bone, Hurricane Chris, Fabolous, and several members of Game's own record label, The Black Wall Street Records, including XO, K-Young, Menace, Maad Maxx and Juice. Production was handled by several record producers, including Pharrell Williams, Ryan Leslie, Cool & Dre, Scoop DeVille, Bink! and Phonix Beats, among others.|$|E

2500|$|Notable acts of {{resistance}} included theft of 2 tons of TNT from the [...] "Społem" [...] factory {{run by the}} Nazis, which were then used by the partisans to make hand grenades. Also, the daring escape from jail in Kielce of {{a dozen or so}} AK members, organized in November 1942 by Stanisław Depczyński. Not to mention, a grenade attack by a unit of the GL on the Smoleński coffee shop, killing 6 Germans including a major in the SS (February 1943), as well as the assassination of the noted Gestapo informant Franz Wittek on 15 June 1944, by a unit under Second Lt. Kazimierz Smolak on the corner of Solna and Paderewski Streets. One of the attackers died during the attack and a further four lost their lives not long afterwards. This was not the first assassination attempt against Wittek. In 1942, Henryk Pawelec fired <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> market square, but his pistol misfired. In February 1943, a unit under the command of Stanisław Fąfar shot at Wittek by the Seminarium building. Wittek, though wounded by 14 bullets, survived. Successful assassinations of local collaborators, including the shooting of Jan Bocian took place in broad daylight at a shop in Bodzentyńska Street. Similar was the attack on the factory of C. Wawrzyniak in March 1943, terrorizing and disarming the volksdeutscher workers and destroying the machinery, as well as the attack on the HASAG factory in May 1943 and the takeover of the Kielce Herbskie railway station.|$|E
