5|$|As {{technology}} improved, {{measurement of}} depth, {{latitude and longitude}} became more precise and it became possible to collect more or less continuous sets of data points. This allowed researchers to draw accurate and detailed maps of {{large areas of the}} ocean floor. Use of a continuously recording fathometer enabled Tolstoy & Ewing in the summer of 1947 to identify and describe the first <b>abyssal</b> <b>plain.</b> This plain, south of Newfoundland, is now known as the Sohm <b>Abyssal</b> <b>Plain.</b> Following this discovery many other examples were found in all the oceans.|$|E
5|$|Abyssal plains are {{typically}} covered by very deep sea, but during {{parts of the}} Messinian salinity crisis much of the Mediterranean Sea's <b>abyssal</b> <b>plain</b> was exposed to air as an empty hot dry salt-floored sink.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Seilacher has {{suggested}} the Ediacaran sees animals usurping giant protists {{as the dominant}} life form. The modern xenophyophores are giant single-celled protozoans found throughout the world's oceans, largely on the <b>abyssal</b> <b>plain.</b> A recent genetic study suggested that the xenophyophores are a specialised group of Foraminifera. There are approximately 42 recognised species in 13 genera and 2 orders; one of which, Syringammina fragilissima, is among the largest known protozoans at up to 20 centimetres in diameter.|$|E

30|$|The <b>abyssal</b> <b>plains</b> {{are located}} between 3000 and 5000 meters deep, and cover 54 % of the planet’s surface. A {{big part of}} this region is covered with {{biogenic}} sediments, although hard substrata such as manganese nodules {{may be found in}} some places. Characteristically, the biota of <b>abyssal</b> <b>plains</b> is limited by food, since this environment is devoid of primary production and depends on the input of organic matter from surface waters. Because of its extent and difficulty of access, the <b>abyssal</b> <b>plains</b> are among the least understood ecosystems of our planet, despite the great diversity that these environments may harbor (Smith et al. 2008).|$|R
5000|$|Seabed mining: a {{possible}} future use, recovering natural metal ore nodules from the sea's <b>abyssal</b> <b>plains.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{creation}} of the <b>abyssal</b> <b>plain</b> {{is the result of}} the spreading of the seafloor (plate tectonics) and the melting of the lower oceanic crust. Magma rises from above the asthenosphere (a layer of the upper mantle), and as this basaltic material reaches the surface at mid-ocean ridges, it forms new oceanic crust, which is constantly pulled sideways by spreading of the seafloor. Abyssal plains result from the blanketing of an originally uneven surface of oceanic crust by fine-grained sediments, mainly clay and silt. Much of this sediment is deposited by turbidity currents that have been channelled from the continental margins along submarine canyons into deeper water. The rest is composed chiefly of pelagic sediments. Metallic nodules are common in some areas of the plains, with varying concentrations of metals, including manganese, iron, nickel, cobalt, and copper.|$|E
5|$|While similar lifeforms {{have been}} known to exist in {{shallower}} oceanic trenches (>7,000m) and on the <b>abyssal</b> <b>plain,</b> the lifeforms discovered in the Challenger Deep may represent independent taxa from those shallower ecosystems. This preponderance of soft-shelled organisms at the Challenger Deep may be a result of selection pressure. Millions of years ago, the Challenger Deep was shallower than it is now. Over the past six to nine million years, as the Challenger Deep grew to its present depth, many of the species present in the sediment of that ancient biosphere were unable to adapt to the increasing water pressure and changing environment. Those species that were able to adapt may have been the ancestors of the organisms currently endemic to the Challenger Deep.|$|E
5|$|Eleven of the 31 {{described}} {{species of}} Monoplacophora (a class of mollusks) live below 2000meters. Of these 11 species, two live {{exclusively in the}} hadal zone. The greatest number of monoplacophorans are from the eastern Pacific Ocean along the oceanic trenches. However, no abyssal monoplacophorans have yet {{been found in the}} Western Pacific and only one abyssal species has been identified in the Indian Ocean. Of the 922 known species of chitons (from the Polyplacophora class of mollusks), 22 species (2.4%) are reported to live below 2000meters and two of them are restricted to the <b>abyssal</b> <b>plain.</b> Although genetic studies are lacking, at least six of these species are thought to be eurybathic (capable of living {{in a wide range of}} depths), having been reported as occurring from the sublittoral to abyssal depths. A large number of the polyplacophorans from great depths are herbivorous or xylophagous, which could explain the difference between the distribution of monoplacophorans and polyplacophorans in the world's oceans.|$|E
30|$|In short, {{there is}} a paucity of studies on {{cultivable}} bacteria from the <b>abyssal</b> <b>plains,</b> despite the importance to biotechnology (Arahal and Ventosa 2006; Simon-Colin et al. 2008; Pettit 2011), for the description of new species and to understand physiological aspects {{that are relevant to}} the survival of deep-sea microorganisms. Therefore, the aim of this study was the isolation of microorganisms from sediment samples collected on the <b>abyssal</b> <b>plains</b> of the Eastern South Atlantic Ocean and their phylogenetic identification.|$|R
50|$|Approximately 1,100 mud volcanoes {{have been}} {{identified}} on land and in shallow water. It {{has been estimated that}} well over 10,000 may exist on continental slopes and <b>abyssal</b> <b>plains.</b>|$|R
2500|$|There {{are various}} environments in the oceans, {{including}} deep-sea trenches, <b>abyssal</b> <b>plains,</b> volcanic seamounts, convergent, divergent, and transform plate margins. [...] Not only is land {{a major source}} of the ocean sediments, but organisms living within the ocean contribute, as well.|$|R
25|$|Demersal fish live on or {{near the}} bottom of the sea. Demersal fish are found by the {{seafloor}} in coastal areas on the continental shelf, and in the open ocean they are found along the outer continental margin on the continental slope and the continental rise. They are not generally found at abyssopelagic or hadopelagic depths or on the <b>abyssal</b> <b>plain.</b> They occupy a range of seafloors consisting of mud, sand, gravel or rocks.|$|E
25|$|Demersal fish {{live and}} feed {{on or near}} the bottom of seas or lakes (the {{demersal}} zone). They occupy the sea floors and lake beds, which usually consist of mud, sand, gravel or rocks. In coastal waters they are found {{on or near the}} continental shelf, and in deep waters they are found on or near the continental slope or along the continental rise. They are not generally found in the deepest waters, such as abyssal depths or on the <b>abyssal</b> <b>plain,</b> but they can be found around seamounts and islands. The word demersal comes from the Latin demergere, which means to sink.|$|E
25|$|Ocean floor {{disposal}} of radioactive waste {{has been suggested}} by the finding that deep waters in the North Atlantic Ocean do not present an exchange with shallow waters for about 140 years based on oxygen content data recorded {{over a period of}} 25 years. They include burial beneath a stable <b>abyssal</b> <b>plain,</b> burial in a subduction zone that would slowly carry the waste downward into the Earth's mantle, and burial beneath a remote natural or human-made island. While these approaches all have merit and would facilitate an international {{solution to the problem of}} {{disposal of}} radioactive waste, they would require an amendment of the Law of the Sea.|$|E
30|$|Deep-sea environments are {{the largest}} {{continuous}} ecosystems on our planet. Except for specific places considered diversity hot spots, such as hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, other deep-sea environments including the <b>abyssal</b> <b>plains</b> are in most cases scarcely studied (Jorgensen and Boetius 2007).|$|R
500|$|<b>Abyssal</b> <b>plains</b> {{were not}} {{recognized}} as distinct physiographic {{features of the}} sea floor until the late 1940s and, until very recently, none had been studied on a systematic basis. They are poorly preserved in the sedimentary record, {{because they tend to}} be consumed by the subduction process.|$|R
50|$|Satellites {{are also}} used to measure bathymetry. Satellite radar maps deep-sea {{topography}} by detecting the subtle variations in sea level caused by the gravitational pull of undersea mountains, ridges, and other masses. On average, sea level is higher over mountains and ridges than over <b>abyssal</b> <b>plains</b> and trenches.|$|R
25|$|The Cascadia Basin is {{the heavily}} {{sediment}} {{part of the}} Juan de Fuca Plate that extends from the base the continental margin to the west where the sediments lap on to the Juan de Fuca Ridge flank. The Juan de Fuca Plate {{is one of the}} last remnants of the Farallon Plate, the original eastern Pacific oceanic plate, which has been almost entirely subducted beneath North America. The flat sediment surface constitutes an <b>abyssal</b> <b>plain,</b> an exceedingly vast environment that covers over 50% of the planet’s surface. Seemingly inhospitable, with temperatures below 2°C, high-pressures, and a total absence of light, the Cascadia Basin is nevertheless home to an assortment of well-adapted organisms.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{mostly on}} marine snow—the {{continuous}} shower of mostly organic detritus falling from surface waters—little {{is known about}} the complicated food web connecting the organisms of the deep. Because of the harsh environment, there is a low density of organisms observed. Despite the low density, there is a fairly diverse community living on the <b>abyssal</b> <b>plain.</b> Installation and maintenance work has enabled a number of these organisms to be observed. The main groups of organisms observed include fish (skates and rattails), echinoderms (sea cucumbers, sea stars, brittle stars, and crinoids), molluscs (octopus and squid), sea pens, crabs, and squat lobsters. A number of pelagic (living in the water column) organisms were observed such as squid, jellyfish, ostracods, ctenophores, and salps.|$|E
25|$|In the Late Jurassic, Gondwanaland {{begins to}} break apart {{creating}} Western Gondwana, which {{was composed of}} the South American and African continental land masses, and Eastern Gondwana. The Eastern Gondwanian continent was made Madagascar, Greater India, Antarctica, and Australia. During {{this period of time}} Australia shared its southern margin with Antarctica and the western margin (now the Exmouth Plateau) with Greater India. The formation of the Exmouth's northern margin, the Argo <b>Abyssal</b> <b>Plain,</b> was not initiated until 155 million years ago when Australia broke apart from a continental fragment of the Burma plate that's present location is argued to be subsumed under Asia. It wasn't until 20 million years later that the Greater Indian land mass broke from western Australia, forming the central and southern margins of the Exmouth Plateau now known as the Gascoyne and Cuvier Abyssal Plains. As Australia continued to diverge away from the Antarctic land mass, it migrated in a northeastern direction and rotated counterclockwise to it present location, leaving the Exmouth Plateau along the continent's western margin.|$|E
50|$|Munidopsis is a genus of squat lobster. It is {{the second}} largest of all the genera of squat lobsters, after Munida, with over 200 species. Its members are mainly found on {{continental}} slopes and on <b>abyssal</b> <b>plains.</b> A few fossil species are also known, including specimens from the Campanian (Cretaceous).|$|R
2500|$|The benthic {{zones are}} aphotic and {{correspond}} to the three deepest zones of the deep-sea. The bathyal zone covers the continental slope down to about [...] The abyssal zone covers the <b>abyssal</b> <b>plains</b> between 4,000 and 6,000m. Lastly, the hadal zone corresponds to the hadalpelagic zone, which is found in oceanic trenches.|$|R
50|$|They {{were first}} {{described}} by Henry Bowman Brady in 1883. They are abundant on <b>abyssal</b> <b>plains,</b> {{and in some}} regions are the dominant species. Fourteen genera and approximately 60 species have been described, varying widely in size.The largest, Syringammina fragilissima, is among the largest known coenocytes, reaching up to 20 cm in diameter.|$|R
25|$|While in the {{stratosphere}} (post-test period), the tritium interacted with and oxidized to water molecules and was present {{in much of the}} rapidly produced rainfall, making tritium a prognostic tool for studying the evolution and structure of the hydrologic cycle as well as the ventilation and formation of water masses in the North Atlantic Ocean. Bomb-tritium data were used from the Transient Tracers in the Ocean (TTO) program in order to quantify the replenishment and overturning rates for deep water located in the North Atlantic. Bomb-tritium also enters the deep ocean around the Antarctic. Most of the bomb tritiated water (HTO) throughout the atmosphere can enter the ocean through the following processes: a) precipitation, b) vapor exchange, and c) river runoff – these processes make HTO a great tracer for time-scales up to a few decades. Using the data from these processes for 1981, the 1TU isosurface lies between 500 and 1,000meters deep in the subtropical regions and then extends to 1,500–2,000meters south of the Gulf Stream due to recirculation and ventilation in the upper portion of the Atlantic Ocean. To the north, the isosurface deepens and reaches the floor of the <b>abyssal</b> <b>plain</b> which {{is directly related to the}} ventilation of the ocean floor over 10 to 20 year time-scales.|$|E
500|$|The {{wreck of}} Bismarck was {{discovered}} on 8 June 1989 by Dr. Robert Ballard, the oceanographer responsible for finding [...] Bismarck {{was found to}} be resting upright at a depth of approximately , about [...] west of Brest. The ship struck an extinct underwater volcano, which rose some [...] above the surrounding <b>abyssal</b> <b>plain,</b> triggering a [...] landslide. Bismarck slid down the mountain, coming to a stop two-thirds down.|$|E
500|$|An <b>abyssal</b> <b>plain</b> is an {{underwater}} plain on the deep ocean floor, usually found at depths between [...] and [...] Lying generally between {{the foot of}} a continental rise and a mid-ocean ridge, abyssal plains cover more than 50% of the Earth’s surface. They are among the flattest, smoothest and least explored regions on Earth. Abyssal plains are key geologic elements of oceanic basins (the other elements being an elevated mid-ocean ridge and flanking abyssal hills).|$|E
5|$|The flat {{appearance}} of mature <b>abyssal</b> <b>plains</b> {{results from the}} blanketing of this originally uneven surface of oceanic crust by fine-grained sediments, mainly clay and silt. Much of this sediment is deposited from turbidity currents that have been channeled from the continental margins along submarine canyons down into deeper water. The remainder of the sediment comprises chiefly dust (clay particles) blown out to sea from land, {{and the remains of}} small marine plants and animals which sink from the upper layer of the ocean, known as pelagic sediments. The total sediment deposition rate in remote areas is estimated at two to three centimeters per thousand years. Sediment-covered <b>abyssal</b> <b>plains</b> are less common in the Pacific Ocean than in other major ocean basins because sediments from turbidity currents are trapped in oceanic trenches that border the Pacific Ocean.|$|R
40|$|Sediment {{delivery}} to the abyssal {{regions of the}} oceans is an integral process in the source to sink cycle of material derived from the hinterland. How sediments are transported down-slope, {{and where they are}} deposited has implications for the mass balance of the upper lithosphere, hydrocarbon reserves, climate archives and sequence stratigraphic models. The Zambezi River, the largest in southern Africa, delivers vast amounts of material to the continental shelf, submarine Sofala/Zambesia Bank. The Sofala/Zambesia Bank acts as a staging area for this riverine input prior to its redistribution toward the <b>abyssal</b> <b>plains</b> of the Mozambique Channel. Much of this material is said to be directed into the submarine Zambezi Valley and Channel. Until this study, however, the sediment transfer routes between the Sofala/Zambesia Bank and <b>abyssal</b> <b>plains</b> of the Mozambique Channel have been quite poorly understood and remain unconstrained. The aim of this contribution is to better constrain sediment transport pathways to the <b>abyssal</b> <b>plains</b> using the latest, regional, high resolution multibeam bathymetry data available, taking into account the effects of bottom water circulation, antecedent basin morphology and sea level change. Results show that sediment transport and {{delivery to}} the <b>abyssal</b> <b>plains</b> is discreetly partitioned into southern, central and northern domains. This sediment partitioning is primarily controlled by changes in continental shelf and shelf break morphology under the influence of a dynamic anticyclonic inshore circulation system. However, changes in base level have an overarching control on sediment delivery to particular domains at various sea levels. A direct consequence of these controlling factors is limited sediment delivery to the submarine Zambezi Valley and Channel under present-day conditions, with increased activity envisaged during regression. Furthermore, the “on-off” switching of discrete domains along strike is a sequence stratigraphic concept generally not previously considered in the shelf-slope-abyssal continuum. The proposed sediment transport routes, under varied sea level scenarios, provide a framework which relates shallow to mid depth studies with those focused on the deep regions of the Mozambique Channel providing the first inclusive account of shelf to abyssal sediment transport in the region...|$|R
25|$|Contourite {{sheets are}} broad, low-relief {{features}} that extend through very large areas (i.e. ~1,000,000 km2) and are seen covering the <b>abyssal</b> <b>plains</b> or even plastered against the continental margins.

There may be several separate populations in the Atlantic, and sharks in the Mediterranean and off Japan appear to be distinct as well.|$|E
