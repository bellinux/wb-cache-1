5|$|Nitrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements in organic chemistry. Many organic functional groups involve a carbon–nitrogen bond, such as amides (RCONR2), amines (R3N), imines (RC(=NR)R), imides (RCO)2NR, <b>azides</b> (RN3), azo compounds (RN2R), cyanates and isocyanates (ROCN or RCNO), nitrates (RONO2), nitriles and isonitriles (RCN or RNC), nitrites (RONO), nitro compounds (RNO2), nitroso compounds (RNO), oximes (RCR=NOH), and pyridine derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in quaternary ammonium salts, R4N+), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as acids at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and pyrrole is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring. The amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the Kjeldahl method. In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids, amino acids and thus proteins, and the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen may be usefully {{compared}} to its horizontal neighbours carbon and oxygen {{as well as}} its vertical neighbours in the pnictogen column (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth). Although each period 2 element from lithium to nitrogen shows some similarities to the period 3 element in the next group from magnesium to sulfur (known as the diagonal relationships), their degree drops off quite abruptly past the boron–silicon pair, so that the similarities of nitrogen to sulfur are mostly limited to sulfur nitride ring compounds when both elements are the only ones present. Nitrogen resembles oxygen far more than it does carbon with its high electronegativity and concomitant capability for hydrogen bonding and the ability to form coordination complexes by donating its lone pairs of electrons. It does not share carbon's proclivity for catenation, with the longest chain of nitrogen yet discovered being composed of only eight nitrogen atoms (PhN=N–N(Ph)–N=N–N(Ph)–N=NPh). One property nitrogen does share with both its horizontal neighbours is its preferentially forming multiple bonds, typically with carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen atoms, through pπ–pπ interactions; thus, for example, nitrogen occurs as diatomic molecules and thus has very much lower melting (−210°C) and boiling points (−196°C) than the rest of its group, as the N2 molecules are only held together by weak van der Waals interactions and there are very few electrons available to create significant instantaneous dipoles. This is not possible for its vertical neighbours; thus, the nitrogen oxides, nitrites, nitrates, nitro-, nitroso-, azo-, and diazo-compounds, <b>azides,</b> cyanates, thiocyanates, and imino-derivatives find no echo with phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth. By the same token, however, the complexity of the phosphorus oxoacids finds no echo with nitrogen.|$|E

25|$|Other {{examples}} {{of this type of}} tautomerism can be found in bullvalene, and in open and closed forms of certain heterocycles, such as organic <b>azides</b> and tetrazoles, or mesoionic münchnone and acylamino ketene.|$|E
25|$|Nitrene {{addition}} to alkenes is a well-established method for {{the synthesis of}} aziridines. Photolysis or thermolysis of <b>azides</b> are good ways to generate nitrenes. Nitrenes can also be prepared in situ from iodosobenzene diacetate and sulfonamides, or the ethoxycarbonylnitrene from the N-sulfonyloxy precursor.|$|E
500|$|Many {{variants}} {{on these}} processes are possible.The most ionic of these nitrides {{are those of}} the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, Li3N (Na, K, Rb, and Cs do not form stable nitrides for steric reasons) and M3N2 (M = Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba). These can formally be thought of as salts of the N3− anion, although charge separation is not actually complete even for these highly electropositive elements. However, the alkali metal <b>azides</b> NaN3 and KN3, featuring the linear [...] anion, are well-known, as are Sr(N3)2 and Ba(N3)2. <b>Azides</b> of the B-subgroup metals (those in groups 11 through 16) are much less ionic, have more complicated structures, and detonate readily when shocked.|$|E

50|$|Lead <b>azide</b> in its pure {{form was}} first {{prepared}} by Theodor Curtius in 1891. Due to sensitivity and stability concerns, the dextrinated form of lead <b>azide</b> (MIL-L-3055) {{was developed in}} the 1920s and 1930s with large scale production by DuPont Co beginning in 1932. Detonator development during World War II resulted in the need for a form of lead <b>azide</b> with a more brisant output. RD-1333 lead <b>azide</b> (MIL-DTL-46225), a version of lead <b>azide</b> with sodium carboxymethylcellulose as a precipitating agent, was developed to meet that need. The Vietnam War saw an accelerated need for lead <b>azide</b> and it was during this time that Special Purpose Lead <b>Azide</b> (MIL-L-14758) was developed; the US government also began stockpiling lead <b>azide</b> in large quantities. After the Vietnam War, the use of lead <b>azide</b> dramatically decreased. Due {{to the size of the}} US stockpile, the manufacture of lead <b>azide</b> in the US ceased completely by the early 1990s. In the 2000s, concerns about the age and stability of stockpiled lead <b>azide</b> led the US government to investigate methods to dispose of its stockpiled lead <b>azide</b> and obtain new manufacturers.|$|R
5000|$|The azo-transfer compounds, trifluoromethanesulfonyl <b>azide</b> and imidazole-1-sulfonyl <b>azide,</b> are {{prepared}} from sodium <b>azide</b> as well. They react with amines {{to give the}} corresponding azides: ...|$|R
500|$|The nitride anion (N3−) is {{the strongest}} π donor known amongst ligands (the second-strongest is O2−). Nitrido {{complexes}} are generally made by thermal decomposition of <b>azides</b> or by deprotonating ammonia, and they usually involve a terminal {≡N}3− group. The linear azide anion (...) , being isoelectronic with nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and cyanate, forms many coordination complexes. Further catenation is rare, although [...] (isoelectronic with carbonate and nitrate) is known.|$|E
500|$|Nitrogen is a {{chemical}} element with symbol N and atomic number 7. It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772. Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish had independently done so {{at about the}} same time, Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first. The name nitrogen was suggested by Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790, when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates; this name derives from the Greek roots νἰτρον [...] "nitre" [...] and -γεννᾶν [...] "to form". Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote, from the Greek άζωτικός [...] "no life", as it is an asphyxiant gas; his name is instead used in many languages, such as French, Russian, and Turkish, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, <b>azides</b> and azo compounds.|$|E
500|$|Nitrous acid (HNO2) is {{not known}} as a pure compound, but is a common {{component}} in gaseous equilibria and is an important aqueous reagent: its aqueous solutions may be made from acidifying cool aqueous nitrite ( [...] , bent) solutions, although already at room temperature disproportionation to nitrate and nitric oxide is significant. It is a weak acid with pK'a 3.35 at 18°C. They may be titrimetrically analysed by their oxidation to nitrate by permanganate. They are readily reduced to nitrous oxide and nitric oxide by sulfur dioxide, to hyponitrous acid with tin(II), and to ammonia with hydrogen sulfide. Salts of hydrazinium [...] react with nitrous acid to produce <b>azides</b> which further react to give nitrous oxide and nitrogen. Sodium nitrite is mildly toxic in concentrations above 100mg/kg, but small amounts are often used to cure meat and as a preservative to avoid bacterial spoilage.

This makes it a key reagent in explosives. Photochemistry experiments with bromine <b>azide</b> have found that UV photolysis of {{a small sample of}} bromine <b>azide</b> resulted in dissociation of the entire sample, making it unstable. Similar samples with <b>azide</b> molecules did not show such an effect.
