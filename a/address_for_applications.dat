This conclusion is reinforced with closed-form calculations of rotary joint structural efficiency in extension. Also, transition truss-member loads are higher in the one-bay rotary joint.

Structural characterization of metalloproteins and identification of metal coordination features including numbers and types of ligands and metal-ligand geometry, and mapping the structural and dynamic changes upon metal binding are significant for understanding biological functions of metalloproteins. NMR spectroscopy has long been used as an invaluable tool for structure and dynamic studies of macromolecules.

The presence of tumor budding (TB) at the tumor-host interface of gastrointestinal cancers has been recognized as a hallmark of unfavorable disease biology. TB {{is defined as the}} presence of dedifferentiated cells or small clusters of up to five cells at the tumor invasive front and can be observed in aggressive carcinomas of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, ampulla, colon and rectum. Presence of TB reproducibly correlates with advanced tumor stage, frequent lymphovascular invasion, nodal and distant metastasis. The UICC has officially recognized TB as additional independent prognostic factor in cancers of the colon and rectum.

Buckling, that in past years was not a governing limit state because of rather high thicknesses and of limited spans of structural elements, should be now assessed possibly accounting for actual defects, i. e. delaminations, and applying straightforward but cost-effective approaches, easy to implement in the everyday practice of composite hull structural design.

40|$|Abstracts: A {{new set of}} basis {{functions}} {{was constructed}} using the Rossby-Haurwitz waves, which are the eigenfunctions of nondivergent barotropic vorticity equations on the sphere. The basis functions were designed to be non-separable, that is, not factored into functions of either the longitude or the latitude. Due to this property, the nodal lines of the functions are aligned neither along with the meridian nor the parallel. The basis functions can be categorized into groups of which members have the same degree or the total wavenumber-like index on the sphere. The orthonormality of the basis functions {{were found to be}} close to the machine roundoffs, giving the error of O(10 − 15) or O(10 − 16) for double-precision computation (64 bit arithmetic). It was demonstrated through time-stepping procedure that the basis functions were also the eigenfunctions of the non-divergent barotropic vorticity equations. The projection of the basis functions was carried out onto the low-resolution geopotential field of Gaussian bell, and compared with the theory. The same projections were performed for the observed atmospheric-geopotential height field of 500 hPa surface to demonstrate decomposition into the fields that contain disturbance of certain range of horizontal scales. The usefulness of the new basis functions was thus <b>addressed</b> <b>for</b> <b>application</b> to the eigenmode analysis of the atmospheric motions on the global domain...|$|R
40|$|Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DWI) {{has become}} a useful tool in {{medicine}} {{for the purpose of}} diagnosis, tracking disease progression, and monitoring response to therapy. The current techniques used for DWI suffer from artifacts due to magnetic field inhomogeneities, image distortion, and low spatial resolution. The aim of the presented work is to advance DWI by improving upon and developing novel high-resolution acquisition techniques. The approach taken for this purpose was to utilize radial fast spin-echo data acquisitions, which have been shown to produce high-resolution DWI without artifacts due to magnetic field inhomogeneities. In addition, there is little image distortion in radial fast spin-echo DWI, which allows for direct overlay onto anatomical MRI. However, a draw back is that radial methods require longer scan times. By increasing the imaging speed of existing radial fast spin-echo acquisitions, it may become a more practical clinical tool. In addition, novel acquisition techniques are developed that push high-resolution to all three dimensions. By employing a three-dimensional radial fast spin-echo acquisition, voxels in an image have equal size in each dimension and can be on the order of 1 mm 3. By decreasing the voxel size, the tissue contained within a voxel is more homogeneous. This is important <b>for</b> DWI <b>applications</b> that aim to measure the microscopic integrity of the tissue. The development and analysis of the novel radial fast spin-echo techniques are presented in this work along with several clinical applications.

40|$|With {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of the Internet, there is increasing interest in using it for audio and video transmission. Periodic network overloads, leading to bursty packet losses, have always been a key problem for network researchers. In a long-haul, heterogeneous network like the Internet, handling such an error becomes especially difficult. Perceptual studies of audio and video viewing have shown that bursty losses have the most annoying effect on people, and hence are critical issues to be <b>addressed</b> <b>for</b> <b>applications</b> such as Internet phone, video conferencing, distance learning, etc. Classical error handling techniques have focused on applications like FTP, and are geared towards ensuring that the transmission is correct, with no attention to timeliness. For isochronous traffic like audio and video, timeliness is a key criterion, and given the high degree of content redundancy, some loss of content is quite acceptable. In this paper we introduce the concept of error spreading, which is a transformation technique that takes the input sequence of packets (from an audio or video stream) and scrambles its packet before transmission. The packets are unscrambled at the receiving end. The transformation is designed to ensure that bursty losses in the transformed domain get spread all over the sequence in the original domain. Perceptual studies have shown that users are much more tolerant of a uniformly distributed loss of low magnitude. We next describe a continuous media transmission protocol based on this idea, and validate its performance through an experiment performed on the Internet. ...|$|R

40|$|Borides and {{carbides}} {{of early}} transition metals {{are considered a}} class of promising materials <b>for</b> several <b>applications,</b> the most appealing ones being in the aerospace and energy sectors. Beside the well known characteristics that make UHTCs attractive as TPS, {{there is a strong}} interest in their applications as sunlight absorbers for solar concentrating systems that can operate in the high temperature regime. The first part of this work is focused on toughening of UHTCs, which is a crucial issue that needs to be <b>addressed</b> <b>for</b> <b>application</b> in the aerospace sector. Different strategies have been developed to increase the fracture toughness, through either incorporation of elongated reinforcement (SiC chopped fibers, SiC whiskers) or in-situ development of SiC platelet-reinforced materials. The mechanical properties are compared to those of the un-reinforced materials and the effect of different kinds of sintering aids amongst Si 3 N 4, MoSi 2 and ZrSi 2 is studied. Toughening mechanisms such as crack deflection, bridging, bowing and residual stresses are explored through analysis of crack propagation. Experimental increases of toughness are compared to those predicted by theoretical models. Addition of fibers or whiskers allows toughness to be increased from 3 - 4 MPa m 1 / 2 (for unreinforced materials) to 5. 0 - 6. 3 MPa m 1 / 2. On the other hand, quite often, the improvement of fracture toughness is accompanied by a decrease of strength, due to a change of the defects population. The second part of this work is dedicated to the characterization of various carbides and borides, in terms of room temperature and high temperature mechanical, thermal and optical properties.
