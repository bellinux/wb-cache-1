5000|$|The {{organizational}} structure included three main groups: Airplane Operations; Engineering, and Post Operations, which were, in turn, sub-divided into various Divisions and Sections. A parts Depot (Air Depot No. 4), was never developed as such, {{and was used}} basically for parts storage to support the internal operations of Orly Field. The Post Operations group was concerned with {{the administration of the}} facility, such as security, provost, fire marshal, quartermaster department, the post office (APO 702) and other miscellaneous offices. During 1918, construction was an ongoing process at Orly and the war ended before it was fully completed. [...] The Engineering Department was responsible for the various shops needed to repair <b>aircraft.</b> <b>Aircraft</b> rigging, <b>installing</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>engines,</b> overhauling engines, sheet metal fabrication, electronics, carpentry, fuselage and wing repairs, rubber and tire vulcanizing and the like were performed by the unit.|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of an iterative design method allows the aerodynamic design of isolated and <b>installed</b> <b>engine</b> nacelles subjected to complex aircraft configurations. The method couples a flow solver for {{the solution of}} the Euler/Navier-Stokes equations on unstructured grids with a design algorithm which solves the transonic potential equation for small perturbations via an inverse formulation. The surface pressure distribution of the initial configuration is gained by solving the Euler/Navier-Stokes equations and is compared with a user-defined target pressure distribution. Using the inverse method, the surface pressure difference is converted into a geometry difference. The iterative approach leads to a nacelle geometry which fulfills the target pressure distribution. The accuracy and robustness of the method is investigated for redesigns of isolated and <b>installed</b> <b>engine</b> nacelles in inviscid and viscous transonic flow. Several design cases demonstrate the efficient {{application of}} the method for the aerodynamic design of <b>installed</b> <b>engine</b> nacelles under influence of a complex aircraft configuration. One application shows that the method also can be used to minimize installation effects by nacelle shaping during the engine integration process. A general design methodology for engine nacelles is derived which allows to take into account all aerodynamic effects on complex configurations during the design process. (orig.)
