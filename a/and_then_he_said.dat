2500|$|My friend said, [...] "Listen to {{this guy}} play", and I went, [...] "No way! Listening to someone play the guitar is the very last thing I want to do right now!" [...] But he kept insisting {{and he ended up}} playing the record for me. I told him I thought it was really good <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "You know, the guy's only playing with two fingers on his {{fretboard}} hand because of an injury he sustained in a terrible fire." [...] I was totally knocked back by this revelation and was so impressed by what I had just heard that I suddenly became inspired to start trying to play again.|$|E
2500|$|And he said, [...] "Mum, I'm in... big trouble... You {{know this}} Nouvelle Solidarité?"... He said, [...] "I can't do this... I want out." [...] And {{at that point}} the phone was cut. And then it rang back again almost immediately. And the first thing that he said that time was, [...] "Mum, I'm frightened." [...] I {{realised}} he was in such danger that I said to him, [...] "I love you." [...] <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I want to see you now."... I said, [...] "well, where are you, Jerry?" [...] He said, [...] "Wiesbaden." [...] And I said, [...] "How do you spell it?" [...] And he said, [...] "W I E S." [...] And then the phone was cut.|$|E

2500|$|In 2010, Linehan {{discussed}} the dramatic effect this choice {{had on the}} tone of the series: [...] "'Woman of the World' was kind of like a jaunty, plinky-plonky song, and we wanted that song. He [...] gave us two choices: he gave us that, and [...] "Songs of Love", and we wanted the plinky-plonky song because our idea was we were making fun of sitcoms. We were saying, you know, we don't like sitcoms. This is a parody of sitcoms. This is a kind of satire on sitcoms. And I remember Geoffrey [...] looking really glum and sad about this, you know? <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'Why do you want to make fun of your characters?' He said, 'People will love these characters.' And that was just a real revelation for me, and after that, whatever he said went, as far as I was concerned." ...|$|E
2500|$|Describing the {{composition}} of [...] "Oh Yeah", the album's best known track, Blank said, [...] "First I did the music and then I invited Dieter to sing along, and {{he came up with}} some lines which I thought, 'no Dieter, it's too complicated, we don't need that many lyrics'. I had the idea of just this guy, a fat little monster sits there very relaxed and says, [...] "Oh yeah, oh yeah". So I told him, 'Why don't you try just to sing on and on 'oh yeah'?... Dieter was very angry when I told him this and he said, 'are you crazy, all the time [...] "Oh yeah"? Are you crazy?! I can't do this, no no, come on, come on.' <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'some lyrics, like [...] "the moon... beautiful", is this too much?!' and I said, 'no, it's OK', and then he did this 'oh yeah' and at the end he thought, 'yeah it's nice', he loved it himself also. And also I wanted to install lots of human noises, all kind of phonetic rhythms with my mouth; you hear lots of noises in the background which are done with my mouth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Former French {{president}} Valéry Giscard d'Estaing {{claimed that}} Bongo helped bankroll Jacques Chirac's 1981 presidential campaign. Giscard said Bongo {{had developed a}} [...] "very questionable financial network" [...] over time. [...] "I called Bongo and told him 'you're supporting my rival's campaign' {{and there was a}} dead silence that I still remember to this day <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> 'Ah, you know about it', which was extraordinary. From that moment on, I broke off personal relations with him", said Giscard. Socialist French parliamentarian André Vallini reportedly claimed that Bongo had bankrolled numerous French electoral campaigns, both Right and Left. In 2008, French President, Nicolas Sarkozy demoted his minister in charge of looking after the ex-colonies, Jean-Marie Bockel, after the latter noted the [...] "squandering of public funds" [...] by some African regimes, provoking Mr. Bongo's fury.He made his country and his oil industry available as a source of offshore slush funds", said political analyst Nicholas Shaxson, {{the author of a book}} on Africa's oil states. [...] "These were used by all the French political parties — from the left to the right — for secret party financing, and as a source of bribes in support of French commercial bids all over the world.|$|E

6000|$|When Kit {{knew the}} pay he lighted a {{cigarette}} <b>and</b> pondered. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The offer's good, but I can't take the post. For one thing, I've engaged {{to go to}} Cuba for Don Arturo." ...|$|R

60|$|He was {{woke up at}} {{six o'clock}} in the morning by the cabman opening the door.

6000|$|He seated Rabda in a chair, {{placed his}} hand on her forehead, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> drew {{the tips of his fingers}} several times slowly down her face. Her eyes closed.
