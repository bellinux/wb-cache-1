40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to propose procedures for measuring service life and evaluating the quality of locallymade and used solid tires in Thailand. The solid tires were stressed and rotated until blowout on a drum-like test apparatuswhich is designed, constructed by the authors and equipped with laboratory instrumentation. Solid tires from five differentmanufacturers were selected for testing. We measured service life, length of time to tire failure, at three different loadingamplitudes and three different speeds on the testing drum. The service life of all specimens was studied and compared todetermine the possibility of using service life to evaluate the quality of <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> <b>tire...</b>|$|E

5000|$|Pneumatic tires {{also have}} a much lower rolling {{resistance}} than <b>solid</b> <b>tires.</b> Because the internal air pressure acts in all directions, a pneumatic tire is able to [...] "absorb" [...] {{bumps in the road}} as it rolls over them without experiencing a reaction force opposite to the direction of travel, {{as is the case with}} <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> (or foam-filled) <b>tire.</b> The difference between the rolling resistance of <b>a</b> pneumatic and <b>solid</b> <b>tire</b> is easily felt when propelling wheelchairs or baby buggies fitted with either type so long as the terrain has a significant roughness in relation to the wheel diameter.|$|R

50|$|When war {{exploded}} in 1914, the United States Government issued {{a call for}} better truck wheels. Walther heard this and by 1916 was ready to submit his ideas to the War Department.

Walther carried this wheel on the train to Washington where he presented it to the War Department.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two general}} {{categories}} of tires on which stand-up scooters travel—hard tires and air tires. Hard tires are generally six {{inches in diameter}} and constructed of a hard-plastic insert surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> rubber <b>tire.</b> Air tires are most often 10 inches in diameter. They are constructed of a steel or aluminum split rim, an inner tube and rubber tire. Other, less common wheel and tire types include 8 inch and 13 inch air tires.|$|R
25|$|This {{required}} the Steadicam {{to be on}} a special mount modeled on a wheelchair in which the operator sat while pulling a platform with the sound man. The weight of the rig and its occupants proved to be too much for the original tires however, resulting in a blowout one day that almost caused <b>a</b> serious crash. <b>Solid</b> <b>tires</b> were then mounted on the rig. Kubrick also had a highly accurate speedometer mounted on the rig so as to duplicate the exact tempo of a given shot so that Brown could perform take after identical take. Brown also discusses how the scenes in the hedge maze were shot with a Steadicam.|$|R
40|$|It is {{advantageous}} to use small scale {{testing in the}} design phase of tires due to the costs and uncontrollable environmental conditions of outdoor testing. Therefore a laboratory abrasion and skid tester is used to obtain more insight in the contact of a tread compound with the road for dry conditions. In the experimental setup <b>a</b> small <b>solid</b> <b>tire,</b> with adjustable slip angle, is pressed on an abrasive corundum disk. The present friction between the abrasive disk and <b>solid</b> <b>tire</b> drives the tire and the resulting forces are measured with a triaxial force sensor. Several experiments under different normal loads, slip angles and velocities of the disk are conducted. To explain observed phenomena of lateral force measurements for a free rolling tire under a number of slip angles a FE model is used. The relevant parts of the setup are modeled in Abaqus and the steady state performance of the small tire under different slip angles is evaluated. It is shown that the present turnslip, which has great impact on the slip velocity field at {{the trailing edge of}} the contact area, is captured well with the model. Furthermore the calculated cornering stiffnesses are in good agreement with the experiments...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on two aspects related to wheeled mobility: 1) Evaluating {{the impact of a}} new tire design on powered mobility, and 2) Instrumentation that permits better {{monitoring}} and assessment of wheeled mobility in everyday use. The Tweel technology tires developed by Michelin USA are comprised of an outer polyurethane ring supported by polyurethane fins instead of metal spokes, which allow the tire to deflect under pressure. As a wheelchair tire they offer a potential breakthrough as they have deflection properties similar to a pneumatic tire while maintaining the low maintenance of <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> foam-core <b>tire.</b> <b>A</b> study was conducted to compare the Tweel technology <b>tires</b> to standard <b>solid</b> foam-core <b>tires</b> for vibration transmission, traction and overall life span. The Tweel technology tires failed produce any significant difference in vibration transmitted to the user compared to <b>solid</b> foam-core <b>tires.</b> Additionally, the Tweel technology tires showed significant signs of deterioration after a month long field trial, thus indicating a short life span. However, Tweel technology tires provided better traction on both dry and wet concrete. Overall, Tweel technology tires have to be re-engineered to provide better damping properties, leading to lower vibrational levels transmitted to the user. The second section this thesis addressed the need to develop a methodology of measuring mobility in everyday usage. This section is part of a greater ongoing research project at CATEA (Center for Assistive Technology and Environmental Access) aimed at understanding everyday wheelchair usage. Methodology was developed to measure bouts of mobility that characterize wheelchair usage; which includes the number of starts, stops, turns and distance traveled through the day. Three different technologies which included, Accelerometer unit {{on the rim of the}} drive wheel, Gyro-Accelerometer unit on the frame of the chair and Reed switches, were tested. Testing included various criteria for accuracy, durability and compatibility for measuring bouts of everyday wheeled mobility. Although a single technology could not be used to measure all aspects of mobility, the Accelerometer unit on the rim met the design criteria for measuring starts stops and distance, while the Gyro-Accelerometer unit met the requirements for measuring turns.

40|$|AbstractThe first {{small scale}} {{commercial}} tire waste pyrolysis plant has been installed by the Radiant Renewable Energy (RRE) Ltd. at Gazipur, Dhaka for reducing liquid fuel crisis in Bangladesh. The plant has two pyrolysis unit, {{each of them}} consists of a horizontal axis rotary type batch mode reactor with a recycling capacity of 4. 5 tons/run. <b>Solid</b> <b>tire</b> wastes in half/whole size are feed into the reactor chamber, operating at 420 oC with a light over-pressure of 0. 03 bar. The reactor is heated externally by burning product pyrolysis liquids for first three hours and by burning product pyro-gas for rest five hours. The products distribution at optimum reactor operating condition were found oil: 45 wt%, char: 35 wt%, and gases: 10 wt%, {{in addition to the}} steel cords: 10 wt% of <b>solid</b> <b>tire</b> waste. The product liquids have been found to have a high gross calorific value (GCV) of around 44 MJ/kg, which would encourage their use as replacements for conventional liquid fuels. Pyrolytic char may be used as <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> fuel, activated carbon, priters ink etc. Pyrolysis gas contains high concentrations of methane, ethane, butadiene and other hydrocarbon gases with a GCV of approximately 37 MJ/m 3, a value sufficient to provide the energy required by the tire pyrolysis process. However, the presented plant should be followed some recommended pionts for better operation and its further extension, and also for our sincere corner to safe environment. The plant can be run only under continuous monitoring and consultancy support of a tire pyrolysis specialist team because of new technology and waste material concern...|$|R
