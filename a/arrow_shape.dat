25|$|At the Battle of Mormant on 17 February 1814, Napoleon's army {{encountered}} a Russian force of 2,500 infantry and 1,800 cavalry under Peter Petrovich Pahlen. The leading French formations arranged themselves into an <b>arrow</b> <b>shape</b> with Victor's infantry in the center. François Étienne de Kellermann led the right flank cavalry with the divisions of Lhéritier and Anne-François-Charles Trelliard while Milhaud led the left flank cavalry with the divisions of Hippolyte Piré and André Briche. Kellermann hurled Lhéritier's division at Pahlen's Cossacks while Trelliard {{went after the}} Russian infantry. Auguste Etienne Lamotte's brigade defeated two Cossack regiments, but when two more Cossack regiments appeared, Collaert's brigade charged and swept them away. Pahlen lost 2,114 infantry and one-third of his cavalry in the debacle. When the French cavalry pursuit reached Nangis it routed Anton Leonhard von Hardegg's Austrian division of the Allied V Corps. In the afternoon Lhéritier and Étienne Maurice Gérard's Paris Reserve combined to defeat the 3rd Bavarian Division in the combat of Valjouan. At {{this time there was}} a reorganization of the cavalry so that on 20 February 1814, Collaert became the commander of the 2nd Brigade of Lhéritier's 4th Heavy Cavalry Division in Milhaud's V Cavalry Corps. The 2nd Brigade consisted of 616 horsemen from the 22nd and 25th Dragoons.|$|E

60|$|Section 7. The {{method of}} {{examining}} cross-sections {{is an extremely}} convenient one {{in the study of}} such a type as Amphioxus. The student should very carefully go over and copy the six sections on Sheet 20, comparing Figure 1 as he goes. He should do this before reading what follows. One little matter must be borne in mind. These figures are merely intended to convey the great structural ideas, and they are considerably simplified; they must not be regarded as a substitute for the examination of microscopic sections. [He will notice a number of rounded masses from the body wall. The] -For instance, the body-wall- muscles of Amphioxus are arranged in bundles bent sharply in an <b>arrow</b> <b>shape,</b> the point forward. -A number of these bundles are cut in any one section, and so the even shading of our diagrams, if they professed to be anything more than diagrams, should be broken up into masses.- These -bundles, we may mention-, are called myomeres, and they are indicated in Figure 1 by lines pointing acutely forward. [Several are consequently cut in any transverse section (Sheet 20), and these are the rounded masses he sees.] Similar myomeres, similarly situated, are found in fish, behind the head, and, less obviously, they occur with diminishing importance as the scale of the vertebrata is ascended.|$|E

The earliest-known reference to a school teaching shurikenjutsu is to Ganritsu Ryu, active during the 17th century. This school utilized a long, thin implement with a bulbous head, thought to be derived from the arrow.
