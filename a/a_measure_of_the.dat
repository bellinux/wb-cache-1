5|$|Climate is <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{long-term}} {{trends in}} the weather. Various factors are known to influence the climate, including ocean currents, surface albedo, greenhouse gases, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit.

40|$|Abstract. We {{have found}} that the nearest {{neighbor}} (NN) test is <b>an</b> insufficient <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cluster hypothesis. The NN test is <b>a</b> local <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cluster hypothesis. Designers of new document-to-document similarity measures may incorrectly report effective clustering of relevant documents if they use the NN test alone. Utilizing <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> from network analysis, we present <b>a</b> new, global <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cluster hypothesis: normalized mean reciprocal distance. When used together with <b>a</b> local <b>measure,</b> such as the NN test, this new global measure allows researchers to better measure the cluster hypothesis...|$|R

5|$|Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{activity}} {{of a hurricane}} season. It is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds every six hours, summing the results, and dividing that total by 104. As a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force winds until it becomes a tropical storm, tropical depressions {{are not included in}} these tables. For all storms, ACE is given to three significant figures. The ACE in the east Pacific proper (140°W to North America) is given; the ACE in the central Pacific (the International Date Line to 140°W) is given in parentheses.|$|E

5|$|MDOT's 2007 traffic surveys {{counted the}} average annual daily traffic (AADT), <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> number of {{vehicles}} using a section of roadway {{on any given day}} of the year. An average of 38,000vehicles used the western section of M-8 along Davison Avenue in 2007 each day; the eastern segment carried 37,300vehicles. The section of freeway in between carried in excess of 50,000 vehicles a day in 2007 between M-10 and I-75. Of this traffic, 1,900trucks and other commercial vehicles used the trunkline.|$|E

The same surveys showed that only 90trucks are included in that average. In comparison, US41 south of M-67 carried an average of 2,300vehicles and 270trucks. No segment of the trunkline is listed on the National Highway System, a system of strategically important highways.|$|E
5|$|On March 22, 2005, NASA {{released}} {{news that}} infrared {{light from the}} planet had been measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope, the first ever direct detection of light from an extrasolar planet.

New measurements from this observation determined the planet's temperature as at least 750°C (1300°F). The circular orbit of HD 209458 b was also confirmed.|$|E

5|$|Plasma {{temperature}} is commonly measured in kelvins or electronvolts and is, informally, <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thermal kinetic energy per particle. High temperatures are usually needed to sustain ionization, {{which is a}} defining feature of a plasma. The degree of plasma ionization is determined by the electron temperature relative to the ionization energy (and more weakly by the density), in a relationship called the Saha equation. At low temperatures, ions and electrons tend to recombine into bound states—atoms—and the plasma will eventually become a gas.|$|E

It is <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volume of gas that can be released from the full cylinder at atmospheric pressure. Terms used for the capacity include 'free gas volume' or 'free gas equivalent'. It depends on the internal volume and the working pressure of a cylinder.
