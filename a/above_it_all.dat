5|$|The {{damage caused}} to the North Tower {{destroyed}} any {{means of escape}} at the impact zone or <b>above</b> <b>it.</b> <b>All</b> stairwells and elevators from the 92ndfloor up were rendered impassable, trapping 1,344people. According to the Commission Report, hundreds were killed instantly by the impact; the rest were trapped and died from the subsequent fire and smoke, the eventual collapse, or (in some cases) after jumping or falling from the building. Elevator shafts channeled burning jet fuel through the building. At least one elevator shaft carried burning fuel downward, exploding on the 77thfloor, the 22ndfloor, and at street level on the West Side Lobby.|$|E
2500|$|The public controversies {{stirred up}} by all these actions lasted into 1873. [...] Rising <b>above</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> in January {{of that year}} Gowen presided over {{formation}} of the [...] "coal pool" [...] or [...] "anthracite combination"—including other big coal executives Asa Packer, Thomas Dickson, George Hoyt, and Samuel Sloan—which established [...] "the first industry-wide price-fixing agreement in America." [...] It both set the sales price for coal and allotted the tonnage each member railroad was allowed to haul to market for the coming year.|$|E
2500|$|While God {{may seem}} to exhibit dual natures (masculine-feminine, compassionate-judgmental, creator-creation), all adherents of Kabbalah have {{consistently}} stressed the ultimate unity of God. For example, in all discussions of Male and Female, the hidden nature of God exists <b>above</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> without limit, being called the Infinite or the [...] "No End" [...] (Ein Sof)—neither one nor the other, transcending any definition. The ability of God to become hidden from perception is called [...] "Restriction" [...] (Tzimtzum). Hiddenness makes creation possible because God can become [...] "revealed" [...] in a diversity of limited ways, which then form {{the building blocks of}} creation.|$|E

2500|$|Koger and Postuma sanded Clapton's 1964 SG Standard (not, as {{is found}} in various sources, a 1961 model, and not an SG Special) and painted it with {{oil-based}} enamel paint in the [...] "gaudy dayglo colours of the day." [...] As Koger explained, [...] "the single thread running through all of my paintings is nostalgia for paradise." [...] The theme of the SG's design is [...] "good versus evil, heaven versus hell, {{and the power of}} music in the universe to rise <b>above</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> as a force of good". The centrepiece on the face is a cherub holding a triangle, surrounded by yellow stars on a celestial blue background ("a Fool hallmark"). The angel's curly hairstyle was inspired by Clapton's hairstyle at the time. Flames come up {{from the bottom of the}} guitar (the bass-bout with the volume and tone controls) and the treble point has rainbow-coloured arcs. The pick guard contains a landscape with mountains and a red sun on the horizon, a [...] "Dutch miniature" [...] representing paradise. On the back, coloured concentric circles are surrounded by coloured waves.|$|E
6000|$|Instantly at {{the word}} [...] "Amen," [...] like the popping of a cork, the tumult burst out again. Hands clapped, {{laughter}} flared out, desks were slammed, papers were rattled, feet pounded, and the brazen monotonous clanging voice of the clerk sounded <b>above</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> like some new steam calliope whose sounds were words.|$|E

60|$|The {{afternoon}} wore on. From {{the surrounding}} village the ape-man heard {{the bustle of}} preparation for the feast.

60|$|On the 23rd a mine sixty {{feet long}} and twenty feet broad was discovered, just as a whole {{battalion}} of Hanoverian troops had taken up their place <b>above</b> <b>it.</b> <b>All</b> were congratulating themselves on the narrow escape, when a mine placed below that they had discovered exploded, burying all in the upper mine in the ruins.|$|E
6000|$|... "You can see," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "from the {{position}} of St. Paul's, where the old wall went.

Afterwards he made a sort of inventory of the provisions. Life in the high air was giving him an appalling appetite, and it seemed to him discreet at this stage to portion out his supply into rations. So far as he could see he might pass a week in the air.|$|E
60|$|But {{she seemed}} {{so young and}} so frail. She was indeed only a girl. As she stood by the fire washing herself--she was proud to wash herself at this time--and he looked at her, his heart was full of extreme {{tenderness}} for her. Such fine, fine limbs, her slim, round arms like chasing lights, and her legs so simple and childish, yet so very proud. Oh, she stood on proud legs, with a lovely reckless balance of her full belly, and the adorable little roundnesses, and the breasts becoming important. <b>Above</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> her face was like a rosy cloud shining.|$|E

60|$|Norah {{found her}} way {{mechanically}} to the tea-table {{and made her}} fingers frantically busy in rearranging the parsley round the sandwich dish. On {{one side of her}} loomed the morose countenance of the Major, on the other she was conscious of the scared, miserable eyes of Vladimir. And <b>above</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> hung that. She dared not raise her eyes above the level of the tea-table, and she almost expected to see a spot of accusing vulpine blood drip down and stain the whiteness of the cloth. Her aunt’s manner signalled to her the repeated message to “be bright”; for the present she was fully occupied in keeping her teeth from chattering.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{few minutes}} past nine when I descended into the long, oaken gallery where breakfast was served, and {{at the head of}} the {{principal}} table sat Mr. Ravenor in hunting costume. Everyone who was down was evidently bound for the meet. The men were nearly all in scarlet coats, and the women in riding-habits and trim little hats, with their veils pushed back. There was a great clatter of knives and forks, and a good deal of carving going on at the long, polished sideboard, and <b>above</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> a loud hum of cheerful talk; altogether it was a very pleasant meal that was in progress.|$|E

60|$|We {{had been}} riding out a storm at an {{altitude}} of about three thousand feet. All night we had hovered above the tossing billows of the moonlight clouds. The detonation of the thunder and the glare of lightning through an occasional rift in the vaporous wall proclaimed the continued fury of the tempest upon the surface of the sea; but we, far <b>above</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> rode in comparative ease upon the upper gale. With the coming of dawn the clouds beneath us became a glorious sea of gold and silver, soft and beautiful; but they could not deceive us as to the blackness and the terrors of the storm-lashed ocean which they hid.|$|E
60|$|At first {{all went}} well. He was borne up the seas; he {{slid down the}} seas in a lather of white foam. Presently {{the rise and fall}} grew steeper, and the foam began to break over his head. Robert could no longer guide himself; he must go as he was carried. Then in an instant he was carried into a hell of waters where, {{had it not been for}} his lifebelt and the plank, he must have been beaten down and have perished. As it was, now he was driven into the depths, and now he emerged upon their surface to hear their seething hiss around him, and <b>above</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> a {{continuous}} boom as of great guns--the boom of the breaking seas.|$|E
60|$|The painter {{had come}} on impulse; because Christian had told him to, not of his own free will. He was angry with himself, wounded in self-esteem, for having allowed any one to render him this service. The smooth swift {{movement}} through velvet blackness splashed on either hand with the flying lamp-light; the strong sweet air blowing in his face-air that had kissed the tops of mountains and stolen their spirit; the snort and snuffle of the horses, and crisp rattling of their hoofs--all this soon roused in him another feeling. He looked at Mr. Treffry's profile, with its tufted chin; at the grey road adventuring in darkness; at the purple mass of mountains piled <b>above</b> <b>it.</b> <b>All</b> seemed utterly unreal.|$|E
