5|$|But {{the player}} {{primarily}} responsible for elevating the Modern Benoni {{to the status of}} a major opening was Mikhail Tal, who took up the opening in 1953 after seeing one of Nezhmetdinov's games. The tactical positions it led to were <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>fit</b> for Tal's combinatorial gifts and he crushed many opponents in brilliant style. Famous examples include his game against Bukhuti Gurgenidze at the 1957 USSR championship, excerpted below, and his win against Yuri Averbakh at the same tournament the following year.|$|E

After the story was transitioned to a more upbeat story of five female superhumans, the character designs were redone to have a lighter, more colorful feel. The main series characters were praised for being <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>fit</b> for the overall story, {{as well as for}} their cute appearances. The characters introduced in a la Mode were also praised for their visual appearances, but criticized as being repeats of the original series.|$|E
5|$|The Batsuit {{consisted}} of 110 separate pieces, {{each of which}} had to be replicated dozens of times {{over the course of the}} production. The base layer was made of a polyester mesh that is utilized by the military and high-tech sports manufacturers because of its breathability and moisture-wicking properties. Molded pieces of flexible urethane were then attached to the mesh, to form the overall body armor plating. Carbon fiber panels were placed inside the sections on the legs, chest and abdomen. The cowl was sculpted from a cast of Bale's face and head to become <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>fit</b> for Christian Bale. The suit remained unchanged for the film since The Dark Knight.|$|E

In his first season, the 18-year-old finished {{second on the}} team in scoring and then in his sophomore year was considered the star of Toronto's upset of the record-breaking Montreal Canadiens of 1944–45. He established himself {{as the leader of}} the team and became captain in 1948. Although not the best skater in the league, Kennedy was a fierce forechecker and skilled playmaker. Kennedy was <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>fit</b> into coach Hap Day's emphasis on defense and positional play. He gained a reputation for scoring the important goal and excelling in the playoffs. Kennedy holds the Toronto Maple Leafs' all-time record for career points in the Stanley Cup Finals and is the youngest player in the history of the NHL to have scored a Stanley Cup winning goal. A Sports Illustrated poll of hockey experts in 1998 rated Kennedy as having the best face-off skills in the history of the NHL.|$|E

It stars Natalie Portman, Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis, Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder. The plot revolves around a production of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake ballet by a prestigious New York City ballet company. The production requires a ballerina to play the innocent and fragile White Swan, for which the committed dancer Nina (Portman) is <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>fit,</b> {{as well as the}} dark and sensual Black Swan, which are qualities better embodied by the new arrival Lily (Kunis). Nina is overwhelmed by a feeling of immense pressure when she finds herself competing for the part, causing her to lose her tenuous grip on reality and descend into a living nightmare.|$|E
5|$|Part of the canonization of the Zhou yi bound it {{to a set}} of ten commentaries {{called the}} Ten Wings. The Ten Wings are of a much later {{provenance}} than the Zhou yi, and are the production of a different society. The Zhou yi was written in Early Old Chinese, while the Ten Wings were written in a predecessor to Middle Chinese. The specific origins of the Ten Wings are still a complete mystery to academics. Regardless of their historical relation to the text, the philosophical depth of the Ten Wings made the I Ching <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>fit</b> to Han period Confucian scholarship. The inclusion of the Ten Wings reflects a widespread recognition in ancient China, found in the Zuo zhuan and other pre-Han texts, that the I Ching was a rich moral and symbolic document useful for more than professional divination.|$|E

The system was used operationally in October 1944, and by 1945 it was universally installed in No. 5 Group RAF.|$|E

40|$|This paper makes a {{contribution}} {{in this direction}} by providing a calibration methodology that recovers (almost) exactly the prices of all the co-terminal swaptions underlying a given Bermudan swaption, and, {{at the same time}}, ensures optimal recovery of user-specified portions of the forward-rate covariance matrix (for instance, the attention could be focussed on caplet prices). The ability to obtain at the same time <b>a</b> virtually <b>perfect</b> <b>fit</b> to European swaptions and an optimal calibration to a user-specified forward-rate covariance matrix is extremely important, since virtually no exotic product depends on the dynamics of one set of state variables only (forward rates or swap rates).
