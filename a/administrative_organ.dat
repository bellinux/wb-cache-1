25|$|The {{premises}} of the CPPA-B {{is part of}} the old administrative centre of Buea Town and located in an old wooden colonial building. The <b>administrative</b> <b>organ</b> responsible for the management of the CPPA-B is the Ministry of Communication whose Regional Delegation’s office is nearby. The building next to the CPPA-B hosts the National Archives Buea, which is under the authority of the Ministry of Arts and Culture. With the abolition of the Federal system in 1975, Cameroon's national archives were centralised in Yaoundé, the capital of the United Republic of Cameroon. The photographs (negatives, contact prints and proof sheets) which are kept in the CPPA-B cover the years from November 1955 to 2000. With the retirement of the last photographer who worked in that service in 2001, the CPPA-B was locked down and abandoned. Some renovations of the exterior were carried out on the building just {{a few days before the}} celebration of the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Anglophone and Francophone Cameroon in February 2014. Inside the building itself, however, nothing was done. In its present state, the CPPA-B lacks the building integrity, security, fire protection, and air quality control that are basic requirements for a long-term archive.|$|E
25|$|During Ngawang Namgyal's rule, {{administration}} comprised a state monastic {{body with}} an elected head, the Je Khenpo (lord abbot), and a theocratic civil government {{headed by the}} Druk Desi (regent of Bhutan, also known as Deb Raja in Western sources). The Druk Desi was either a monk {{or a member of}} the laity—by the 19th century, usually the latter; he was elected for a three-year term, initially by a monastic council and later by the State Council (Lhengye Tshokdu). The State Council was a central <b>administrative</b> <b>organ</b> that included regional rulers, the Zhabdrung's chamberlains, and the Druk Desi. In time, the Druk Desi came under the political control of the State Council's most powerful faction of regional administrators. The Zhabdrung was the head of state and the ultimate authority in religious and civil matters. The seat of government was at Thimphu, the site of a 13th-century dzong, in the spring, summer, and fall. The winter capital was at Punakha Dzong, a dzong established northeast of Thimphu in 1527. The kingdom was divided into three regions (east, central, and west), each with an appointed ponlop, or governor, holding a seat in a major dzong. Districts were headed by dzongpon, or district officers, who had their headquarters in lesser dzong. The ponlop were combination tax collectors, judges, military commanders, and procurement agents for the central government. Their major revenues came from the trade between Tibet and India and from land taxes.|$|E

Meanwhile, external factors are playing an increasingly important role in shaping the development and interpretation of tax law, including the supervision from civilians, tax professionals and non-government organizations as well as the influence of the international tax community. postprin...|$|R
