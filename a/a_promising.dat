Caretaker-manager Dave Watson restored Southall to the starting line-up after Royle's resignation, and steered the club away from relegation.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} {{starts with}} the canonical quantization procedures of quantum theory. Using the initial-value-formulation of general relativity (cf. evolution equations above), {{the result is the}} Wheeler–deWitt equation (an analogue of the Schrödinger equation) which, regrettably, turns out to be ill-defined without a proper ultraviolet (lattice) cutoff. However, with the introduction of what are now known as Ashtekar variables, this leads to <b>a</b> <b>promising</b> model known as loop quantum gravity. Space is represented by a web-like structure called a spin network, evolving over time in discrete steps.|$|E
