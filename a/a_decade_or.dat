5|$|The first {{principal}} keeper was James Ewing {{who looked}} after the light {{for the next}} eleven years. Despite the exceptionally adverse conditions faced by the keepers, which resulted in them receiving additional payments in kind, Ewing {{was not the only}} one who served the light for <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> more. However, some found the lonely rock and its cramped quarters less to their taste. One had to be prevented from diving into the sea and attempting to swim ashore.|$|E
5|$|These {{ships were}} {{designed}} by Sir Edward Reed, the Director of Naval Construction, as replacements for the various gunvessels built for the Crimean War. Being built of green timber, their hulls were starting to rot after <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> more in service, but their engines were still generally sound. As the older ships were broken up their engines were salvaged and transferred to Beacon-class ships under construction. Combat experience against Chinese fortifications had shown that the single 32-pounder smoothbore armament of the earlier ships was not powerful enough so Reed was directed to prepare a twin-screw, shallow draft design suitable for riverine operations that incorporated a pair of steam engines from the older gunboats, a heavy armament, and enough freeboard to allow for service at sea. These rather contradictory requirements forced Reed to discard traditional wooden framing for these ships and the Beacon class became the first ships of the Royal Navy to be framed in iron with wooden planking.|$|E
25|$|Planning, licensing, and {{constructing}} even {{a single}} nuclear plant typically takes <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> more, and plants frequently fail to meet completion deadlines. Due to the dearth of orders in recent decades, the world currently has very limited capacity to manufacture many of the critical components of nuclear plants. Rebuilding that capacity will take <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> more.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes these {{horseshoe}} objects temporarily become quasi-satellites for <b>a</b> few <b>decades</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> {{few hundred}} years, {{before returning to}} their earlier status. Both Earth and Venus {{are known to have}} quasi-satellites.|$|R

25|$|NC: {{very slow}} novae, staying at maximum light for <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> more, fade very slowly. It is {{possible}} that NC type novae are objects differing physically very much from normal novae, for example planetary nebulae in formation, exhibiting Wolf-Rayet star-like features.|$|E
25|$|In 1830 Snow {{became a}} member of the Temperance Movement, and lived for <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> so as a {{vegetarian}} and teetotaler. In the mid-1840s his health deteriorated, and he returned to meat-eating and drinking wine. He continued drinking pure water (via boiling) throughout his adult life. He never married.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the game}} was known and popular in the seventeenth century, it is logical to suppose it may have existed at least <b>a</b> few <b>decades</b> (<b>or</b> perhaps even many centuries) before its {{earliest}} literary reference; but no conclusive evidence has yet been presented to support this theory.|$|R

25|$|The Norwegian {{government}} has examined five long distance high-speed lines radiating out from Oslo to Bergen, Kristiansand/Stavanger, Trondheim, Gothenburg, and Stockholm. A sixth line {{would be a}} coastal line between Bergen, Haugesund and Stavanger. At least two investigations on cost and benefit have been made, released 2007 and 2012. These plans were shelved in 2013, although still open for restart in <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> so.|$|E
25|$|Once {{above the}} atmosphere, {{radiation}} {{due to the}} Van Allen belts, solar radiation and cosmic radiation issues occur and increase.

50|$|Despite {{being only}} <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> old <b>or</b> less at the time, {{three of the}} five major anchor stores have changed, with Drug Emporium {{becoming}} an Office Depot, Kmart becoming Home Depot, and Harris Teeter sold to Kroger. There is also a multi-screen movie theater. A similar explosion in land development has occurred in Hickory Flat in the 2000s.|$|R
40|$|A new mobilities {{paradigm}} emerged <b>a</b> <b>decades</b> <b>or</b> so ago in {{the context}} of significant theoretical shifts, methodological developments and novel research questions and approaches. We begin by considering what is meant by the idea of a “paradigm” from Thomas Kuhn. We then examine many ways in which this new paradigm transformed applied mobilities research over the past decade and how it might continue to reconfigure it. The new paradigm and three interconnected theoretical approaches are set out, before turning {{to assess the impact of}} the new paradigm upon emerging fields of social science by using various quantitative and qualitative measures. We examine the transformed ecology of this significant emergent field. Finally, the article explores the paradigm’s important relevance for applied research in urban transportation, climate change and energy transitions...|$|R
25|$|Development of an {{effective}} global surveillance and response system probably is at least <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> more away, owing to inadequate coordination and funding {{at the international level}} and lack of capacity, funds, and commitment in many developing and former communist states. Although overall global health care capacity has improved substantially in recent decades, the gap between rich and poorer countries in the availability and quality of health care.|$|E

Two-thirds were women and 30 percent were raising children. Only the towns that had made an issue of issuing licenses to out-of-staters had appreciable numbers of them. In the first week, 2,468 same-sex couples applied for licenses, including at least 164 from 27 other states and the District of Columbia.|$|E
25|$|Wild's team {{associated}} type III bursts with {{streams of}} electrons being ejected at a third {{the speed of}} light and taking less than half an hour to reach the Earth. There remained a few sceptics about this interpretation until, <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> so later, American physicists using satellite data regularly detected bursts of electrons 25 minutes or so after solar flares. This was just one component, but to Wild and his colleagues a very exciting one, of a much wider world-leading research program.|$|E

25|$|The {{average age}} of onset of alcohol abuse was 29 years for the Core City men and 41 years for the College men. Full blown alcoholism, where it appeared, usually lasted <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> two before sobriety was attained. The number of alcoholics {{increased}} steadily until age 40 {{and then began to}} decline at a rate of stable remission of 2 to 3% per year. Older alcoholics are relatively rare because of the rate of remission and a higher mortality rate.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the hardest}} hit {{countries}} in Sub-Saharan Africa—and possibly later in South and Southeast Asia—will face a demographic upheaval as HIV/AIDS and associated diseases reduce human life expectancy {{by as much as}} 30 years and kill as many as a quarter of their populations over <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> less, producing a huge orphan cohort. Nearly 42 million children in 27 countries will lose one or both parents to AIDS by 2010; 19 {{of the hardest}} hit countries will be in Sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the leads, {{which are}} small {{diameter}} wires, from the pacemaker to the implantation {{site in the}} heart muscle {{will need to be}} removed. The most common reason for lead removal is infection, however over time leads can degrade due to a number of reasons such as lead flexing. Changes to programming of the pacemaker may overcome lead degradation to some extent. However a patient who has several pacemaker replacements over <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> two in which the leads were reused may require a lead replacement surgery.|$|E

25|$|Until <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> so ago, PV {{was used}} {{frequently}} to power calculators and novelty devices. Improvements in integrated circuits and low power liquid crystal displays {{make it possible}} to power such devices for several years between battery changes, making PV use less common. In contrast, solar powered remote fixed devices have seen increasing use recently in locations where significant connection cost makes grid power prohibitively expensive. Such applications include solar lamps, water pumps, parking meters, emergency telephones, trash compactors, temporary traffic signs, charging stations, and remote guard posts and signals.|$|E
25|$|Caresse {{spent some}} of her time while her husband, Bert Young, fell into a drunken stupor every night, {{churning}} out another 200 pages of pornography. In her diary, Nin observed that everyone who wrote pornography with her wrote out of a self that was opposite {{to his or her}} identity, but identical with his or her desire. Caresse grew up amid the social constraints imposed by her upper-class family in New York. She had a doomed and troublesome romanticism with Harry Crosby. She participated in <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> more of intellectual lovers in Paris during the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|Ovarian cancer {{survival}} varies {{significantly with}} subtype. Dysgerminomas {{have a very}} favorable prognosis. In early stages, they have a five-year survival rate of 96.9%. Around two-thirds of dysgerminomas are diagnosed at stage I. Stage-III dysgerminomas have a five-year survival of 61%; when treated with BEP chemotherapy after incomplete surgical removal, dysgerminomas have a 95% two-year survival rate. Sex-cord-stromal malignancies also have a favorable prognosis; because they are slow-growing, even those with metastatic disease can survive <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> more. Low malignant potential tumors usually only have a bad prognosis when there are invasive tumor implants found in the peritoneal cavity.|$|E
