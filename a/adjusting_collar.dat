50|$|On {{either side}} of the gear are the thrust washers. The thrust washers are pushed against the ball {{bearings}} inside the gear by Belleville washers. On one side of the gear is an <b>adjusting</b> <b>collar,</b> which allows for adjustments in the amount of slip allowed by the differential. A thrust bearing (or thrust race), {{on the opposite side of}} the gear, is used to stop the differential from loosening the retaining screw holding the output cups, used to attach the differential to the axle, onto the differential.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Vyner, with a noisy yawn, {{struggled}} out of {{his chair}} and stood <b>adjusting</b> his <b>collar</b> and waistcoat.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{disengaged}} himself, <b>adjusted</b> his <b>collar</b> and tie, {{which had}} become rumpled, and unlocked the door. At once the head assistant strode into the dormitory.|$|R
6000|$|... "Course you didn't. You never do." [...] McTurk <b>adjusted</b> Beetle's <b>collar</b> with {{a savage}} tug. [...] "Don't drop oil {{all over my}} 'Fors' or I'll scrag you!" ...|$|R
60|$|Newman {{returned}} {{no answer}} to this compliment, but looked over Ralph's shoulder for an instant, (he was <b>adjusting</b> the <b>collar</b> of the spencer behind, just then,) {{as if he were}} strongly disposed to tweak him by the nose. Meeting Ralph's eye, however, he suddenly recalled his wandering fingers, and rubbed his own red nose with a vehemence quite astonishing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{am going}} to like San Francisco," [...] said Tom, as he was <b>adjusting</b> a fresh <b>collar</b> and gazing {{out of the window}} at the same time. [...] "Everything looks so bright and clean." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2006 Stayclip also {{launched}} licensing {{operations to}} mass-produce collar stays for major hotels, clothing designers, and corporations. This involved highly customizable engraving {{using a variety}} of manufacturing methods. Stayclip expanded collar stay manufacturing by adding different [...] "bendable" [...] metals such as non-magnetic high grade stainless steel and titanium. These metals are very durable, yet allow someone wearing a dress shirt to <b>adjust</b> the <b>collar</b> by adding a slight curve to it while in the dress shirt.|$|R
60|$|She {{may have}} waited years, or {{only a few}} minutes; she did not know, but {{presently}} her father came back. His presence there under the lintel of the door seemed to have roused her from her torpor, as if with a swift, telepathic current. As he {{stood for a moment}} beneath the electric light, <b>adjusting</b> the <b>collar</b> of his coat, she saw his face quite distinctly: its expression told her everything. Luke's arrest was imminent. It was but a question of a few hours, moments perhaps.|$|R
50|$|Most {{commonly}} {{this takes}} the form of a collar on a tube, fixed in place by a screw operated by a drum key. This collar mates with a fitting that receives the tube and secures it by means of a wingnut or wingbolt. When the stand is disassembled, only the wingnut or wingbolt needs to be loosened, and the collar remains in place, allowing the stand to be reassembled in exactly the same adjustment. When the stand needs to be <b>adjusted,</b> the <b>collar</b> is first loosened by means of a drum key.|$|R
60|$|When {{his hair}} was {{smoothed}} down comfortably into his eyes, Mrs Prig and Mrs Gamp put on his neckerchief; <b>adjusting</b> his shirt <b>collar</b> with great nicety, so that the starched points should also invade those organs, and afflict them with an artificial ophthalmia. His waistcoat and coat were next arranged; and as every button was wrenched into a wrong button-hole, and the order of his boots was reversed, he presented on the whole rather a melancholy appearance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tailpiece}} anchors the strings, {{so it must}} {{be strong}} enough to withstand their combined tension. Tailpieces of the violin family or viol families of instruments, including double basses, are attached by a [...] "tailgut" [...] looped around the tailpin or end button, which is let into the bottom bock of the instrument. Originally made of animal gut and adjusted with difficulty by means of a knot, tailguts are now usually made of wire or nylon monofilament, and easily <b>adjusted</b> with threaded <b>collars,</b> usually made of brass, on the ends.|$|R
5000|$|Thrown {{naked in}} a desolate room with {{thirteen}} strangers, Tonya Mane discovers she {{is playing a}} deadly game. She must figure out the reason for her abduction. In the room, Tonya finds a tape recorder that explains the rules, one of the which state [...] "Only those without collars can break the rules". One of the strangers cross a forbidden zone, and the electric collar that he wears kills him instantly. A box marked [...] "Pieces" [...] catches Tonya's interest, {{but none of the}} strangers tell her what is inside. Another stranger finds a piece of paper in his pocket; written on it is, [...] "Hint: piece the pieces". Another rule is shown that players may not <b>adjust</b> their <b>collars.</b> As the game progresses, they become mad and frantically {{try to find a way}} out. The host explains that there can be only one winner, and the prize is that person's life.|$|R
6000|$|One of the {{two heads}} {{crawling}} about on the ground now approached. [...] "This rykor belongs to Moak," [...] it said. [...] "I am a Moak. I will take it," [...] and without further discussion it commenced to crawl up {{the front of the}} headless body, using its six short, spiderlike legs and two stout chelae which grew just in front of its legs and strongly resembled those of an Earthly lobster, except that they were both of the same size. The body in the meantime stood in passive indifference, its arms hanging idly at its sides. The head climbed to the shoulders and settled itself inside the leather collar that now hid its chelae and legs. Almost immediately the body gave evidence of intelligent animation. It raised its hands and <b>adjusted</b> the <b>collar</b> more comfortably, it took the head between its palms and settled it in place and when it moved around it did not wander aimlessly, but instead its steps were firm and to some purpose.|$|R
6000|$|When Wampus {{had quite}} {{finished}} his work he arose, <b>adjusted</b> his disarranged <b>collar</b> and tie {{and proceeded to}} crank the engines. Then he climbed into his seat and started the car with a sudden bound. As he did so a revolver shot rang out {{and one of the}} front tires, pierced by the bullet, ripped itself nearly in two as it crumpled up. A shout of derisive laughter came from the cowboys. Algy was astride his pony again, and as Wampus brought the damaged car to a stop the remittance men dashed by and along the path, taking the same direction Uncle John's party was following". Tobey held back a little, calling out: ...|$|R
5000|$|The 944 Turbo S's {{suspension}} had the [...] "M030" [...] option {{consisting of}} Koni adjustable shocks front and rear, with ride height <b>adjusting</b> threaded <b>collars</b> {{on the front}} struts, progressive rate springs, larger hollow rear anti-roll/torsion bars, harder durometer suspension bushings, larger 26.8 mm hollow anti-roll/torsion bars at the front, and chassis stiffening brackets in the front frame rails. The air conditioning dryer lines are routed so as to clear the front frame brace on the driver's side. The 944 Turbo S wheels, known as the Club Sport design, were 16-inch Fuchs forged and flat-dished, similar to the Design 90 wheel. Wheel widths were 7 in in the front, and 9 in in the rear with 52 mm offset; sizes of the Z-rated tires were 225/50 {{in the front and}} 245/45 in the rear. The front and rear fender edges were rolled to accommodate the larger wheels. The manual transmission (case code designation: AOR) featured a higher friction clutch disc setup, an external cooler, and a limited slip differential with a 40% lockup setting. The Turbo S front brakes were borrowed from the Porsche 928 S4, with larger Brembo GT 4-piston fixed calipers and 12-inch discs; rear Brembo brakes remained the same as a standard Turbo. ABS also came standard.|$|R
6000|$|The Keeper {{pretended to}} be <b>adjusting</b> the bear's <b>collar,</b> which gave him an {{opportunity}} of whispering, unheard by Uggug, [...] "my fault, I'm afraid! Quite forgot to fasten the door. Plot's ruined if he finds it out! Keep it up {{a minute or two}} longer. Be savage!" [...] Then, while seeming to pull it back with all his strength, he let it advance upon the scared boy: my Lady, with admirable presence of mind, kept up what she no doubt intended for a savage growl, though it was more like the purring of a cat: and Uggug backed out of the room with such haste that he tripped over the mat, and was heard to fall heavily outside-- an accident to which even his doting mother paid no heed, in the excitement of the moment.|$|R
60|$|The others crowded {{about to}} examine Tara of Helium. One of them whistled, whereupon the girl learned {{something}} of the smaller openings in the walls, for almost immediately there crawled from them, like giant spiders, a score {{or more of the}} hideous heads. Each sought one of the recumbent bodies and fastened itself in place. Immediately the bodies reacted to the intelligent direction of the heads. They arose, the hands <b>adjusted</b> the leather <b>collars</b> and put the balance of the harness in order, then the creatures crossed the room to where Tara of Helium stood. She noted that their leather was more highly ornamented than that worn by any of the others she had previously seen, and so she guessed that these must be higher in authority than the others. Nor was she mistaken. The demeanor of her captor indicated it. He addressed them as one who holds intercourse with superiors.|$|R
5000|$|A typical family tipi is a conical, {{portable}} {{structure with}} two adjustable smoke flaps, multiple poles (historically from 12 to 25 feet long) called lodge poles. Lewis H. Morgan noted that,The frame consists of thirteen poles from fifteen to eighteen feet in length, which, after being tied {{together at the}} small ends, are raised upright with a twist so as to cross the poles above the fastening. They are then drawn apart at the large ends and adjusted upon {{the ground in the}} rim of a circle usually ten feet in diameter. A number of untanned and tanned buffalo skins, stitched together in a form adjustable to the frame, are drawn around it and lashed together, as shown in the figure. The lower edges are secured to the ground with tent-pins. At the top there is an extra skin <b>adjusted</b> as a <b>collar,</b> so as to be open on the windward side to facilitate the exit of the smoke. A low opening is left for a doorway, which is covered with an extra skin used as a drop. The fire-pit and arrangements for beds are the same as in the Ojibwa lodge, grass being used in the place of spruce or hemlock twigs.Lodgepole pine is the preferred wood in the Northern and Central Plains and red cedar in the Southern Plains. [...] Tipis have a detachable cover over the structure. The cover has historically been made of buffalo hide, an optional skin or cloth lining, and a canvas or bison calf skin door. Modern lodges are more often made of canvas.|$|R
