40|$|Kawasaki disease (KD) is a {{pediatric}} vasculitis. Its main complication {{is the development}} of coronary artery aneurysms (CAA), with giant CAA {{at the end of the}} spectrum. We evaluated regression and event-free rates in a non-Asian cohort of patients with giant CAA using the current z-scores adjusted for body surface area instead of <b>absolute</b> <b>diameters.</b> KD patients with giant CAA (z-score[*]≥ 10) visiting our outpatient clinic between January 1999 and September 2015 were included. Patient characteristics and clinical details were extracted from medical records. Regression was defined as all coronary arteries having a z-score of ≤ 3. A major adverse event was defined as cardiac death, myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, or any coronary intervention. Regression-free and event-free rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. We included 52 patients with giant CAA of which 45 had been monitored since the acute phase. The 1 -, 2 -, and 5 -year regression-free rates were 0. 86, 0. 78, and 0. 65, respectively. The 5 -year, 10 -year, and 15 -year event-free rates were 0. 79, 0. 75, and 0. 65, respectively.

30|$|The primary factor {{considered}} for risk of human rAAA is the aortic diameter [2].

40|$|AbstractBackground: Repair of {{aortic coarctation}} is often delayed in small infants {{because of the}} belief that such {{patients}} {{are at risk of}} recurrent arch obstruction and that growth will decrease this risk. To determine whether low weight was a risk factor for recurrent arch obstruction, we reviewed our experience with coarctation repair via left thoracotomy in infants less than 3 months of age. Methods: From 1990 to 1999, 103 patients less than 3 months of age underwent repair of aortic coarctation through a left thoracotomy. Median age was 18 days (1 - 90 days), with 45 patients less than 2 weeks. Median weight was 3. 3 kg (1. 0 - 6. 4 kg) and 14 patients were less than 2 kg. The method of repair was resection and end-to-end anastomosis in 64 patients, subclavian flap angioplasty in 34, and patch augmentation of the arch in 5. Demographic, echocardiographic, and operative variables were analyzed for correlation with recurrent arch obstruction. Results: One early and 1 late death occurred, both in patients who had complications but no evidence of recoarctation. At median follow-up of 24 months, reinterventions for recurrent arch obstruction were performed in 15 patients. The median time to reintervention was 5 months and was less than 1 year in 12 patients. Kaplan-Meier freedom from arch reintervention was 88 % at 1 year (95 % confidence intervals: 82 %- 94 %) and 82 % at 5 years (95 % confidence intervals: 72 %- 92 %). Factors associated with shorter duration to arch reintervention by univariable Cox regression included younger age (continuous, P =. 01; || 2 weeks, P =. 005), smaller transverse arch (<b>absolute</b> <b>diameter,</b> P ||. 001; indexed to weight, P =. 03; indexed to ascending aortic diameter, P =. 02), and smaller ascending aorta (<b>absolute</b> <b>diameter,</b> P =. 02). Smaller absolute transverse arch diameter and younger age were the only independent predictors of shorter time to arch reintervention by multivariable Cox regression analysis. Weight and type of repair did not correlate with risk of recoarctation. Conclusions: Low weight is not a risk factor for recurrent obstruction after repair of coarctation of the aorta in infants less than 3 months of age. Rather, risk of recoarctation is more a function of the anatomy of the arch. Thus, it is not indicated to delay repair in low weight infants with the goal of achieving growth.

40|$|Preliminary {{results of}} a balloon flight on October 11, 1991, of the solar disk sextant (SDS) {{experiment}} are reported. The SDS is an instrument which measures the solar diameter at different orientations {{with respect to the}} solar polar axis. Fitting straight lines through two fixed-angle data sets with time as the independent variable yields slopes of (7. 1 +/ - 1. 5) x 10 exp - 3 and (6. 7 +/- 1. 6) x 10 exp - 3 /mas s, consistent with the value of 6. 47 x 10 exp - 3 /mas s expected from the earth's approach to the sun due to the orbital motion toward perihelion. Upon the instrument's rotation on its axis a sinusoidal component of the diameter measurement was observed in each rotation cycle, with a variable amplitude of about 150 mas.

Analysis of 13 consecutively acquired biplane digital subtraction angiograms before and after PTCA was undertaken to determine intra- and interobserver variability of absolute lesion diameter, relative videodensitometric cross-sectional area, automated percent diameter stenosis and visual percent diameter stenosis using a new fully automated quantitative computer program. The reliability of single-view measurements was also assessed. Both before and after PTCA, measures of <b>absolute</b> <b>diameter</b> showed less interobserver variability than densitometry, percent automated diameter stenosis stenosis and percent visual diameter stenosis measurements (before, R = 0. 95, 0. 83, 0. 86, 0. 70; after, 0. 95, 0. 88, 0. 81, 0. 62, respectively). Relative videodensitometric cross-sectional area correlated poorly with images from the orthogonal view (r = 0. 46). These data suggest that quantitative angiography reduces variability from visual estimates; of all quantitative angiographic measurements, the highest interobserver reproducibility is achieved using absolute lesion diameter both before and after PTCA, probably because no operator interaction is needed to identify a "normal" segment. Unselected, single-view quantitative arteriography is poorly reproducible using videodensitometry. Therefore, automated determination of absolute lesion diameter in at least 2 projections provides the most reproducible evaluation of coronary lesions both before and after PTCA...|$|E

The current work presents an investigation into the effects of using a less than optimum optical configuration for PDA measurements. A standard three dimensional fiber optic PDA system was configured with several transmitting/receiving lens and receiving aperture combinations and used to acquire velocity and drop diameter data downstream of an air/water fire suppressant spray nozzle. Experimental results show that velocity measurements are relatively unaffected by the optical configuration while the diameter measurements can have a considerable bias depending on the optical configuration selected. The optimum optical configuration can be very difficult to choose without apriori knowledge of the diameter range to be measured. Therefore, a straightforward experimental method to determine the optical configuration that provides the least bias for an unknown droplet diameter range is presented...|$|E

Thinning significantly increased mean stem diameter increment by 83 % over that of unthinned plots during the 6 - 9 -yr period after thinning, and by 48 % from 9 - 12 yr after thinning. <b>Absolute</b> <b>diameter</b> increment was positively corre-lated with initial diameter at 1. 30 m from the ground (dbh) both in thinned and unthinned plots. Thin-ning increased growth in large trees more than in smaller trees. Relative diameter growth was nega-tively correlated with initial dbh. It is concluded that individual holm oak stems in previously coppiced stands respond vigourously to thinning, and still do so 6 - 9 yr after thinning. The growth response di-minishes 9 - 12 yr after thinning due to canopy closure.

40|$|AbstractAimsEndothelin (ET) antagonists show {{promise in}} animal models of {{cirrhosis}} and portal hypertension. The {{aim was to}} pharmacologically characterise the expression of endothelin receptors in human liver, hepatic artery and portal vein. Main methodsImmunofluorescence staining, receptor autoradiography and competition binding assays were used to localise and quantify ET receptors on hepatic parenchyma, hepatic artery and portal vein in human cirrhotic or normal liver. Additional experiments were performed to determine the affinity and selectivity of ET antagonists for liver ET endothelin receptors. An endothelial cell ETB knockout murine model {{was used to examine}} the function of sinusoid endothelial ETB receptors. Key findingsETB receptors predominated in normal human liver and displayed the highest ratio (ETB:ETA 63 : 47) compared with other peripheral tissues. In two patients examined, liver ETB expression was up-regulated in cirrhosis (ETB:ETA 83 : 17). Both sub-types localised to the media of normal portal vein but ETB receptors were downregulated fivefold in the media of cirrhotic portal vein. Sinusoid diameter was fourfold smaller in endothelial cell ETB knockout mice. The liver morphology of ETB knockout mice was markedly different to normal murine liver, with loss of the wide spread sinusoidal pattern. In the knockout mice, sinusoids were reduced in both number and <b>absolute</b> <b>diameter,</b> while large intrahepatic veins were congested with red blood cells. SignificanceThese data support a role for the ET system in cirrhosis of the liver and suggest that endothelial ETB blockade may cause sinusoidal constriction which may contribute to hepatotoxicity associated with some endothelin antagonists...|$|E

The accuracy and precision of the edge detection procedure as assessed from cinefilms of contrast-filled acrylate (Perspex) models were - 30 and 90 micrometers, respectively. The variability of the analysis procedure itself in terms of absolute arterial dimensions was less than 0. 12 mm, {{and in terms of}} percentage arterial narrowing for coronary obstructions less than 2. 74 %.

Methods In a population-based trial, men undergoing screening for AAA completed a questionnaire covering their place of birth, smoking habits and consumption of alcohol, meat, fish, salt and milk. We examined the variation by place of birth in the mean, median, 95 th and 99 th centiles of infrarenal aortic diameter and the prevalences of AAA defined by criteria of 30 mm, 50 mm and by the 95 th and 99 th centiles, in men born in Australia, of aortic diameter adjusted for height. Findings Overall, 12 203 (70. 5 %) of the 19 583 men took up the invitation to undergo ultrasound screening. The prevalence of AAA defined by <b>absolute</b> <b>diameter</b> was higher than average in men born in The Netherlands or Scotland (more of whom had ever smoked or smoked currently) and lower in men of Mediterranean origin (more of whom drank alcohol currently). There were no consistent relationships with simple dietary data. Correction of aortic diameter for height eliminated the significant heterogeneity in prevalence of large AAA, although a threefold variation in prevalence of AAA exceeding the 95 th centile of height-adjusted diameter in Australian men persisted.

Fifty patients underwent positron emission tomography of the entire heart using a multislice positron camera and intravenous 82 Rb or nitrogen- 13 ammonia (13 NH 3) before and after intravenous dipyridamole combined with handgrip stress. Images were read by two observers blinded as to clinical or arteriographic data. Automated quantitative coronary arteriography was obtained for the arteriographic determination of coronary Row reserve, previously demonstrated to be a single integrated measure of stenosis severity accounting for all its geometric dimensions oflength, <b>absolute</b> <b>diameter,</b> percent narrowing and asymmetry by quantitative analysis of cine films. Significant coronary artery disease was defined as an arteriographicaUy determined coronary flow reserve of less than 3. 0 based on all stenosis dimensions. Any single geometric measure of stenosis severity alone was an inadequate reference standard for comparison with perfusion images. Sensitivity of identifying patients with coronary artery disease having an arteriographically determined coronary Row reserve of less than 3. 0 was 95 % by positron imaging with a specificity of 100 %. The single case that was missed, studied with 13 NH 3 had a 43 % diameter narrowing of a small ramus intermedius otT the left coronary artery with no significant narrowing of the major coronary arteries.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ratio of}} peak hyperemic/basal mean {{coronary}} flow velocity, {{an index of}} coronary vasodilator reserve, immediately after coronary angioplasty normalizes in < 50 % of patients. To evaluate other indexes of coronary vasodilator capacity, both intracoronary arterial velocity and cardiac venous efflux were measured at rest and during vasodilator-induced coronary hyperemia (intracoronary nitroglycerin and papaverine) before and after angioplasty in 27 patients; 17 patients had measurements of intracoronary velocity alone and 10 had thermodilution measurements of great cardiac vein flow. Coronary flow velocity responses were also measured in 6 angiographically normal segments in patients undergoing angioplasty and in 10 normal left coronary artery segments in patients with normal coronary arteries or isolated right coronary artery disease. Despite significant angiographic (72 ± 12 to 23 ± 11 % diameter narrowing) and hemodynamic (49 ± 12 to 19 ± 12 mm Hg aortocoronary gradient) improvement, coronary vasodilator reserve ratios for both arterial velocity and venous flow after angioplasty were only minimally affected. Angioplasty did not significantly increase rest coronary vein flow or artery flow velocities, but did result in significantly higher papaverine responses after angioplasty. Mean and phasic coronary velocity, diastolic coronary flow velocity integral and measured great cardiac vein flow ratios were significantly lower when compared with those in 16 angiographically normal coronary artery segments. These data indicate that maximal hyperemic coronary flow velocity is increased after angioplasty, but the reserve ratios, calculated by any of several flow velocity indexes, remain minimally improved. Angiographic correlations (percent coronary diameter, <b>absolute</b> <b>diameter</b> or crosssectional area) with variables of coronary blood flow or velocity suggest that no single variable is useful in assessing angioplasty results. However, postangioplasty arterial mean velocity and diastolic flow velocity integral are nearly normalized in most patients, whereas relative changes remain attenuated. These findings are important in studies assessing coronary vasomotor responses in patients with atherosclerotic coronary disease, especially after angioplasty...|$|E
