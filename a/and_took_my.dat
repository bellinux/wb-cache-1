500|$|Matangi was {{recorded}} in various locations around the world, including London, New York and Los Angeles. The track [...] "Atention" [...] (stylised as [...] "aTENTion") {{was recorded}} {{on the island of}} Bequia in the Grenadines. M.I.A. contended that the recording process for the song involved input from Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who purportedly [...] "came into the studio <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> computer and basically decrypted the whole of the internet, and downloaded every word in the whole of the language that contained the word tent within it". [...] The rapper has been a friend of Assange for several years and he made an appearance via Skype at one of her concerts promoting the release of the album. [...] The album was the first by M.I.A. to feature no contribution from producer Diplo, with whom she was in dispute.|$|E

2500|$|...The Lady made a {{sign for}} me to approach; but I was seized with fear, and I did not dare, {{thinking}} that I was faced with an illusion. I rubbed my eyes, but in vain. I looked again, and I could still see the same Lady. Then I put my hand into my pocket, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> rosary. I {{wanted to make the}} sign of the cross, but in vain; I could not raise my hand to my forehead, it kept on dropping" ... "The Lady took the rosary that she held in her hands and she made the sign of the cross".|$|E
2500|$|Every {{morning before}} {{beginning}} work, I visited the animals. One of the elephants, Candy, loved to be scratched on the belly behind her foreleg. I'd scratch {{her and she}} would lean farther and farther toward me until there was some danger of her toppling over on me. One time I started {{to walk away from}} her, and she reached out <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> wrist with her trunk and pulled me back to her side. It was a command: [...] "Don't stop!" [...] I used it in the picture. Noah scratches the elephant's belly and walks away, and the elephant pulls him back to her time after time.|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{incident}} Duchamp later recalled, [...] "I {{said nothing to}} my brothers. But I went immediately to the show <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> painting home in a taxi. It was really {{a turning point in}} my life, I can assure you. I saw that I would not be very much interested in groups after that." [...] Yet Duchamp did appear in the illustrations to Du [...] "Cubisme", he participated in the La Maison Cubiste (Cubist House), organized by the designer André Mare for the Salon d'Automne of 1912 (a few months after the Indépendants); he signed the Section d'Or invitation and participated in the Section d'Or exhibition during the fall of 1912. The impression is, Brooke writes, [...] "it was precisely because he wished to remain part of the group that he withdrew the painting; and that, far from being ill treated by the group, he was given a rather privileged position, probably through the patronage of Picabia".|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless, mother, I {{will give}} myself up, <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> chance. To fly {{would be to}} give them reason to believe me guilty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{he wants}} to {{interfere}} with me, I'll let drive at him <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> chance of getting away," [...] he had explained hurriedly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, various things. Anyhow, {{he wants}} to meet you. <b>And</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> tip, laddie--you go! I should think lunch to-morrow would be {{something}} special." ...|$|R
60|$|He rose <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> hand silently, in his simple, kindly way.|$|E
60|$|With this {{understanding}} I said good-night, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> lonely {{way to my}} apartment.|$|E
60|$|I {{agreed with}} her, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> leave. The loose end had been {{gathered}} up.|$|E

6000|$|... "Dunno. I s'pose I'll {{have to go}} back <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> medicine. Now that I've {{got some}} grub in my stomach I guess I can stand it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's funny, too," [...] he answered, {{and a look}} of singular, musing {{tenderness}} {{fell over}} his face. [...] "I'd rather sit here with you <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> chances." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{door opened}} and Mr. Moyat appeared. Blanche was {{obviously}} annoyed, I was correspondingly relieved. I rose at once, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> leave.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Emma drew nearer <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> hand in hers. At {{the same}} time, {{she held up}} the other scarred and lacerated palm.|$|E
60|$|I hesitated--not in the {{interests}} of propriety; only in the interest of her night's rest. She came close to me, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tain't mother--she's dead. Mammy's our old nurse. She's gone to Jimtown, <b>and</b> <b>taken</b> <b>my</b> duds to {{get some}} new ones fitted to me. These are some o' mother's." ...|$|R

60|$|When {{he ended}} with the self-same {{question}} that Jack had asked me three months before at Thrush Hill he stopped <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> hands.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{sat down}} beside me, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> hand in his, and with very gentle words began to reason and argue with me.|$|E
60|$|I got up <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> hat. She patted {{me on the}} shoulder. I {{could have}} {{throttled}} her at that moment. And yet she was right.|$|E
6000|$|... "I tell you, Martin, Anty's a woman; <b>and,</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> {{word for}} it, what another girl likes won't come amiss to her. Besides, why don't you spake to her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Please don't, Mr. Delaford, I've {{had enough}} of all that. Please go, <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> best wishes, {{as long as you}} don't come here, for I know all about you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They are united, however; <b>and,</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> {{word for}} it, my dear madam, {{that you had}} better leave Pluto alone. The {{interference}} of a mother-in-law is proverbially never very felicitous.' ...|$|R
60|$|And in I went, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> {{place at}} the bottom of the big table, as usual, and my friend the butler speedily brought me a cover.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tut," [...] said Nick, grandly, [...] "I {{run from}} no woman. Eh, Davy?" [...] He pushed past the protesting Lindy {{into the room}} <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] thought I, [...] "I {{knew she}} was old," [...] and I bowed <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> seat. Madame Reuter placed herself at the table {{opposite}} to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{misunderstand}} me," [...] quickly replied Alfred, who had flushed. [...] "I do {{not care}} about myself. I'll go <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> medicine. But I do mind about my horse." ...|$|R
