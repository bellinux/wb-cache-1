50|$|These {{are similar}} to cement mills, but often with a larger gas flow. The gas {{temperature}} is controlled by cold-air bleeds to ensure a dry product without overheating the mill. The product passes into an <b>air</b> <b>separator,</b> which returns oversized particles to the mill inlet. Occasionally, the mill is preceded by a hot-air-swept hammer mill which {{does most of the}} drying and produces millimetre-sized feed for the mill. Ball mills are rather inefficient, and typically require 10-20 kW·h of electric power to make a tonne of rawmix. The Aerofall mill is sometimes used for pre-grinding large wet feeds. It is a short, large-diameter semi-autogenous mill, typically containing 15% by volume of very large (130 mm) grinding balls. Feed can be up to 250 mm, and the larger chunks produce much of the grinding action. The mill is air-swept, and the fines are carried away in the gas stream. Crushing and drying are efficient, but the product is coarse (around 100 µm), and is usually re-ground in a separate ball mill.|$|E
50|$|These are the {{standard}} form in modern installations, occasionally called vertical spindle mills. In a typical arrangement, {{the material is}} fed onto a rotating table, onto which steel rollers press down. A high velocity of hot gas flow is maintained close to the dish so that fine particles are swept away {{as soon as they}} are produced. The gas flow carries the fines into an integral <b>air</b> <b>separator,</b> which returns larger particles to the grinding path. The fine material is swept out in the exhaust gas and is captured by a cyclone before being pumped to storage. The remaining dusty gas is usually returned to the main kiln dust control equipment for cleaning. Feed size can be up to 100 mm. Roller mills are efficient, using about half the energy of a ball mill, {{and there seems to be}} no limit to the size available. Roller mills with output in excess of 800 tonnes per hour have been installed. Unlike ball mills, feed to the mill must be regular and uninterrupted; otherwise damaging resonant vibration sets in.|$|E

40|$|In all large {{passenger}} transport airplanes, halon fire bottles {{are used to}} extinguish fire in the cargo compartments. Halon as a fire-extinguishing agent, contributes {{to the destruction of}} stratospheric ozone in the atmosphere and it is banned in many countries. FAA considers halon 1301 as an effective firefighting agent due to its low toxicity and noncorrosive properties but because it damages the ozone layer, it has been phased out of production. However, it is still widely used on commercial aircraft until a suitable replacement is found. In this paper we will present an alternative approach to using halon 1301 as a fire fighting paradigm. In the proposed method, nitrogen is first extracted from the atmosphere by using the onboard <b>air</b> <b>separator</b> module it is then cooled, and pressurized into the cargo compartments to suppress any fire.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{evaluations}} of an <b>air</b> <b>separator</b> for processing chemical engineering particulate gas streams {{was carried out}} {{with a view to}} investigate the performance for different flow rates and other characteristics. A louver LV <b>air</b> <b>separator</b> was used as a case study. The evaluations indicated that for various set points of characteristics the prediction of operating efficiencies could be made for different variations of louver gap LVG with area ratio AR length of separator at particular angles of LV inclination and the number of LV with flow rates. It was observed that efficiencies ranging from 40 to 60 on one hand were obtained for high values of LVG and gas flow rate. On the other hand efficiencies of 61 to 99 were obtained for lower values of LVG and gas flow rate. It was noted therefore that in order to produce high efficiencies the values of LVG and flow rates have to be low and vice versa. The evaluation indicates also that plant operators can quickly predict from the results the operating efficiency for the desired dimensions and or flow rates of particulate gas streams. The methodology for the determination of operating data can be used in minimum-time frame to optimize the operations of the plant...|$|E
40|$|Modelling and {{simulation}} {{studies were}} carried out at 26 cement clinker grinding circuits including tube mills, <b>air</b> <b>separators</b> and high pressure grinding rolls in 8 plants. The results reported earlier have shown that tube mills can be modelled as several mills in series, and the internal partition in tube mills can be modelled as a screen which must retain coarse particles in the first compartment but not impede the flow of drying air. In this work the modelling has been extended to show that the Tromp curve which describes separator (classifier) performance can be modelled in terms of d(50) (corr), by-pass, the fish hook, and the sharpness of the curve. Also the high pressure grinding rolls model developed at the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre gives satisfactory predictions using a breakage function derived from impact and compressed bed tests. Simulation studies of a full plant incorporating a tube mill, HPGR and separators showed that the models could successfully predict the performance of the another mill working under different conditions. The simulation capability can therefore be used for process optimization and design. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve the {{separation}} efficiency in the air-solid phase, we proposed an innovative separation method called the active pulsing air classifier, which produce pulsing air by a pulsing air generator. In this way, the particles received a new acceleration action in each pulsing period, and then, it obtains a better performance than non-pulsing <b>air</b> <b>separators</b> in the laboratory scale. The dynamic equation of the motion particle in the active pulsing airflow was built up, showing that a higher density particle may get a small acceleration. The simulation results of airflow field show that the airflow turbulence acceleration will disperse the particles and a density dominant separation can be achieved. All high density particles, low density particles, and dust of waste catalyst can be acquired by the active pulsing air classifier. When the airflow velocity is 3. 33 m/s, the frequency of air pulsing is 7 / 3 Hz, the separation efficiency of the active pulsing air classifier reaches its maximum: 97. 63 %. Based on our study, an industry-scale pulsing air classifier is developed, which provides a new and efficient method for resource reutilization...|$|R
40|$|Issue: Recovered {{wood waste}} {{frequently}} contains non-wood contaminants that escape traditional contaminant removal systems. These pervasive contaminants {{might be a}} problem for the end user’s manufacturing process. Furthermore, they devalue the marketability of the resulting feedstocks. Screening techniques might not be effective because of dimensional similarities with the acceptable product. Manual sorting techniques might be ineffective and labor extensive. To produce the cleanest product, a processing facility must maintain a series of contaminant removal systems that are capable of effectively removing the contaminants.

One method {{is to use a}} cabin <b>air</b> <b>separator</b> to sweep oxygen from the cabin air, generate a low pressure/high purity oxygen stream, and compress the oxygen with a multistage mechanical compressor. A main advantage to this type of system is that the existing low pressure oxygen supply infrastructure can be used as the source of cabin oxygen. ISS has two water electrolysis systems that deliver low pressure oxygen to the cabin, as well as chlorate candles and compressed gas tanks on cargo vehicles. Each of these systems can feed low pressure oxygen into the cabin, and any low pressure oxygen source can be used as an on-board source of oxygen.

40|$|The {{application}} of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) in gasification-based power plants {{would represent a}} turning point in the power generation sector, allowing to considerably increase the electric efficiency of coal-fired power stations. Pollutant emissions would also be significantly reduced in integrated gasification fuel cell cycles (IGFC) considering the much lower emissions of conventional pollutants (NO x, CO, SO x, and particulate matter) typical of fuel cell-based systems. In addition, SOFC-based IGFCs appear particularly suited to applications in power plants with CO 2 capture. This is evident by considering that SOFCs operate as <b>air</b> <b>separators</b> and partly oxidized fuel exiting the fuel cell does not contain nitrogen from air, such as in conventional oxyfuel processes.
