40|$|The morphology, infrastructure, {{innervation}} {{and physiology}} {{of the third}} axillary muscle in Manduca sexta were examined to investigate the role of this muscle in flight. The muscle consists of three parts: the upper bundle, which originates on the episternum, and the middle and lower bundles, which originate on the epimeron; all three parts insert {{on the tip of}} a projection from the third axillary sclerite. The middle bundle is composed of tonic fibres, and is innervated by a single slow axon, while the other two bundles consist of intermediate fibres and are each innervated by a single fast axon. The shape and position of the third axillary sclerite within the wing hinge are such that its primary function appears to be remotion of the wing. The length of the third axillary muscle determines the amount of remotion, independently of the degree of elevation or depression of the wing and independently of the amount of remotion of the contralateral wing. Electrophysiological recordings from the three parts of the muscle during tethered flight indicate that they may each function independently of each other and in different ways. The tonic (middle) bundle is capable of maintaining tension to hold the wings in the folded position at rest and is active when the wings are folded at the end of flight. The intermediate (upper and lower) bundles are activated phasically with impulses that may occur with various relationships to the timing of activation of a direct depressor, the subalar, or of several of the elevators. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the third <b>axillary</b> <b>muscles</b> on both sides are important in determining the asymmetric degrees of remotion observed in turning flight...|$|E
40|$|<b>Axillary</b> arch <b>muscle</b> or Langer’s <b>axillary</b> arch is a fibromuscular {{structure}} that stretches across the axilla from its posterior {{wall to the}} anterior wall. We report an unusually large and fleshy <b>axillary</b> arch <b>muscle.</b> This muscle arose from the latissimus dorsi and got inserted into the pectoralis major, short head of biceps brachii and capsule of shoulder joint through three tendinous slips. It was supplied by a branch of thoracodorsal nerve. Notable feature of the muscle is {{that it had a}} tendinous intersection at its junction with the latissimus dorsi. This muscle is capable of compressing the neurovascular bundle of the axilla, causing varied symptoms. Knowledge of its possible existence is important for surgeons as it might lead to misdiagnosis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring the {{dissection}} of a 73 -year-old embalmed male cadaver, {{we noted}} unusual {{variations in the}} flexor compartment of the upper limb—bilateral <b>axillary</b> arch <b>muscles,</b> a three-headed biceps brachii muscle with two supernumerary bellies—and variations in {{the origin of the}} musculocutaneous and median nerves from the brachial plexus. The morphological and clinical significance of this unique coexistence of multiple neuromuscular variations are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The <b>axillary</b> arch <b>muscle</b> of Langer is {{the most}} common {{anatomical}} variant of axillary musculature which is of clinical and surgical importance. It may lead to neurovascular compression syndrome in the cervico-axillary region and can be misinterpreted while examining axilla and also impairs movements of shoulder joint. Observation: During routine dissection of axilla for undergraduate teaching, an unusual muscular slip in the left axilla was observed. The muscular slip was extending from lattisimus dorsi muscle to undersurface o...|$|R
40|$|Langer’s <b>axillary</b> arch (axillopectoral <b>muscle)</b> is {{a variant}} muscular {{structure}} of the axilla which was described under various names as Langer’s <b>muscle,</b> <b>axillary</b> arch or muscular axillary arch by different authors. During routine dissections, we found a muscular slip on the right axillary fossa that originated from latissimus dorsi muscle and attached to the deep surface of the tendon of pectoralis major muscle, and described it as Langer’s axillary arch. Arterial, venous and nervous structures passed under this muscular slip which constitutes an arch in the axillary fossa. Although axillary arch is not very rare, it is generally neglected and not explored or described well. It has immense clinical and morphologic importance for surgical operations performed on axillary region; thus, surgeons should well be aware of its possible existence...|$|R
500|$|The <b>axillary</b> arch <b>muscle</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Bugnone in 1783 according to Pitzorno (1912) with Alexander Ramsay describing it as a novel variation during dissections performed in Edinburgh and London around 1793 {{by his own}} account of 1812. In 1846 Karl Langer wrote up {{an account of the}} axillary arch, although he initially only described it as a fibrous arch, and termed it the Achselbogen (...) [...] Langer later described the presence of a muscular slip associated with the arch in certain cases. Due to these publications Leo Testut used the term arc axillaire de Langer to refer to the muscular form of the arch, an association which has persisted.|$|R
40|$|In {{the left}} upper limb {{of an adult}} male cadaver a {{triangular}} muscular slip, 3. 5 cm long and 2. 5 cm wide, arose from the lower border of latissimus dorsi just proximal to its tendon of insertion. It was inserted by a slender 6 cm long tendon mainly into the coracoid process of the scapula. Three short fibrous strands radiated from this slender tendon to gain attachments to pectoralis minor and the common tendon of origin of the short head of biceps brachii and coracobrachialis. In addition 2 flat tendinous bands attached the margin of this muscular slip to teres major. The thoracodorsal nerve entered the main bulk of latissimus dorsi close to the muscular slip but did not supply a separate branch to the latter. This is an <b>axillary</b> arch <b>muscle</b> in an unusually medial location...|$|R
5|$|The arch is {{considered}} to have no functional significance, although this is challenged by some authors. It {{plays a role in}} entrapment of nearby structures and may alter local anatomy in the event that a dissection of the local area is needed during surgery. The arch appears to arise from the panniculus carnosus, a structure found in most non-primate mammals, and has similarities with muscles found in many animals. The axillary arch has several other names including Langer's <b>axillary</b> arch, the <b>muscle</b> of Langer, axillopectoral muscle, Achselbogen and pectorodorsalis muscle.|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{most common}} {{variation}} of the axillary components in human is the Langer’s <b>axillary</b> arch (axillopectoral <b>muscle).</b> For the first time, Ramsay in 1795 explained this variation, and in 1864, Langer confirmed this and called it as axillary arch of Langer. Case Presentation During routine dissection, we encountered an aberrant slip of muscle and fascia expanded from latissimus dorsi to pectoralis major. Conclusions The axillary arch variation is very clinically important, because it may entrap and implicate the neurovascular bundle. Also {{it is important for}} surgeons during operation, so they {{need to be aware of}} possible presence of such variations...|$|R
40|$|The muscular <b>axillary</b> arch (pectorodorsalis <b>muscle)</b> is an {{uncommon}} muscle variant that {{extends from the}} lateral border of the latissimus dorsi to the pectoralis major muscle tendon, crossing the axillary space (Bergman et al. 1984). This muscle {{has been reported to}} appear in 5 % to 6 % of axillae observed in cadavers. Here, we describe the presence of 4 muscular axillary arches in three cadavers (one cadaver presents the muscle bilaterally). These represent 20 % of the axillae in the sample of 10 cadavers, a higher percentage than expected. The muscular axillary arch also is an important variant clinically as the muscle can compress the neurovascular bundle of the axilla (Rizk and Harbaugh 2008) ...|$|R
40|$|Three {{cases of}} chronic fatigue {{syndrome}} (CFS) that followed acute parvovirus B 19 infection were treated with a 5 -day course of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; 400 mg/kg per day), the only specific treatment for parvovirus B 19 infection. We examined the influence of IVIG treatment on the pro-duction of cytokines and chemokines in individuals with CFS due to parvovirus B 19. IVIG therapy led to clearance of par-vovirus B 19 viremia, resolution of symptoms, and improve-ment in physical and functional ability in all patients, as well as resolution of cytokine dysregulation. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is characterized by severe de-bilitating fatigue that persists for 6 months and is accom-panied by 4 of the following symptoms: impaired memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or <b>axillary</b> lymph nodes, <b>muscle</b> pain, multijoint pain, new headaches, unrefresh...|$|R
40|$|This was a cadaveric study {{aimed at}} {{studying}} {{the incidence of}} <b>axillary</b> arch <b>muscle</b> {{and the extent of}} its different attachments, and discussing its clinical importance. Totally, 30 upper limbs were meticulously dissected to locate the axillary arch. Wherever found, the arch was dissected from its origin to insertion and its nerve supply and blood supply was noted. The dimensions of the arch were measured. Its relations to the structures in axilla were studied in detail. Any additional related variations were investigated. The axillary arch was present in one right upper limb i. e., an incidence of 3. 33 %. The muscle extended from the lateral border of latissimus dorsi <b>muscle</b> across the <b>axillary</b> vessels and nerves lying superficial to the coracobrachialis, short and long heads of biceps brachii muscles, finally dividing into multiple slips of insertions into fascia covering the deep surface of pectoralis major muscle, fascia covering the biceps brachii muscle, and some slips extending into the capsule of shoulder joint. Across the middle of the axillary arch, a tendinous intersection was observed. The muscle was supplied by a branch of the thoraco-dorsal nerve. The presence of the axillary arch must always be kept in mind due to the possibility of such a muscular arch causing axillary vein entrapment, lymphatic compression, and shoulder instability by neurovascular compression, impeding the access to axillary lymph nodes during breast cancer surgeries and in latissimus dorsi transplants. It may also restrict abduction at shoulder joint...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{contrast}} to major flight {{muscles in the}} Mecynorrhina torquata beetle, the third <b>axillary</b> (3 Ax) <b>muscle</b> is a minor flight muscle that uniquely displays a powerful mechanical function despite its considerably small volume, ∼ 1 / 50 that of a major flight muscle. The 3 Ax muscle contracts relatively slowly, and in flight strongly pulls the beating wing to attenuate the stroke amplitude. This attenuation leads to left-right turning in flight or wing folding to cease flying. What enables this small muscle to be so powerful? To explore this question, we examined the microstructure of the 3 Ax muscle using synchrotron x-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, and immunoblotting analysis. We found that the 3 Ax muscle has long (∼ 5 μm) myofilaments and that the ratio of thick (myosin) filaments to thin (actin) filaments is 1 : 5 or 1 : 6. These characteristics are not observed in the major flight muscles, which have shorter myofilaments (∼ 3. 5 μm) with a smaller ratio (1 : 3), and instead are more typical of a leg muscle. Furthermore, the flight-muscle-specific troponin isoform, TnH, is not expressed in the 3 Ax muscle. Since such a microstructure is suitable for generating large tension, the 3 Ax muscle is appropriately designed to pull the wing strongly despite its small volume...|$|R
40|$|Autoimmune {{disorders}} {{are known to}} affect {{a substantial number of}} people worldwide and in some cases may be fatal. They occur in the presence of unregulated inflammatory responses including failure in self-tolerance. Some unexplained disorders with immune compromises may demonstrate certain characteristics that suggest an autoimmune disorderincluding Chronic Fatigue syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). CFS/ME remains an unsolved disorder with multiple symptoms and no single causative factor. Thesesymptoms may include {{but are not limited to}} incapacitating fatigue, weakened short term memory or attentiveness, sore throat, tender cervical or <b>axillary</b> lymph nodes, <b>muscle</b> pain, severe headaches, impaired sleep and postexertional malaise. To date succinct and concise mechanisms that underlie this disorder have not yet being identified although, many hypotheses have been put forward. CFS/ME often occurs as a consequence of a post-infectiousepisode accompanied by compromises in the immune, endocrine and nervous systems. The consequences of these events have not being clearly identified. Importantly, immune deterioration in CFS/ME is related to heightened or suppressed cell function, differential gene expression, equivocal levels of immune cell numbers and protein secretion promoting adverseinflammatory activation. Both innate and adaptive immune system perturbations persist in CFS/ME. These characteristics are in many respects similar to mechanisms of disease in autoimmune disorders suggesting that the changes in immune response may develop fromcellular and molecular changes in immune cells and proteins. We propose here that as the mechanism of CFS/ME may involve certain immunological factors that have been shown to be compromised in other autoimmune diseases, CFS/ME may in some cases have an autoimties of neutrophils in MS include heightened levels of IL- 8, TLR 2, degranulation, impediment in apoptosis (Naegele et al., 2012) ...|$|R
