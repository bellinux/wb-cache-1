5|$|Emus {{were used}} {{as a source of}} food by {{indigenous}} Australians and early European settlers. Emus are inquisitive birds and have been known to approach humans if they see unexpected movement of a limb or piece of clothing. In the wild, they may follow and observe people. Aboriginal Australians used a variety of techniques to catch the birds, including spearing them while they drank at waterholes, catching them in nets, and attracting them by imitating their calls or by arousing their curiosity with a ball of feathers and rags dangled from a tree. The pitchuri thornapple (Duboisia hopwoodii), or some similar poisonous plant, could be used to contaminate a waterhole, after which the disoriented emus were easy to catch. Another stratagem was for the hunter to use a skin as a disguise, and the birds could be lured into a camouflaged pit trap using rags or imitation calls. Aboriginal Australians only killed emus out of necessity, <b>and</b> <b>frowned</b> on anyone who hunted them for any other reason. Every part of the carcass had some use; the fat was harvested for its valuable, multiple-use oil, the bones were shaped into knives and tools, the feathers were used for body adornment and the tendons substituted for string.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{appointment}} of Hawke in 1883, there had been few amateur cricketers in the Yorkshire team, {{in contrast to the}} largely amateur county teams in southern England. Although eight amateurs played for Yorkshire in 1882, there were complaints that the committee preferred to play professionals, which was unusual <b>and</b> <b>frowned</b> on by the cricket establishment at the time. This arose partly from the unavailability of suitably talented amateurs and a clash between the county club and the Yorkshire Gentlemen team, based in York, for whom many amateurs appeared. Some amateurs had a reputation for unreliability and the committee believed that the team frequently lost matches when amateurs appeared.|$|E
25|$|Most {{of major}} tourist {{destinations}} in Indonesia, especially Bali, Yogyakarta, Batam, Bandung and Jakarta, has a rather relaxed modern cosmopolitan social outlook, {{which is quite}} conducive for tourism industry. However, certain regional provinces might not {{have that kind of}} luxury, and tends to be conservative. Next to national laws, several Indonesian provinces has applied regional autonomous law, which some of them based on Islamic sharia law, such as Aceh province, and the city of Palembang. Extra caution must be demonstrated by visitors to Aceh, since the province has a rather strict Islamic-based law, enforced by Islamic religious police, called Wilayatul Hisbah. Thus, some certain normally private matters, such as beach clothing (esp, bikini), modesty issue, party and the consumption of alcohol, to a display of affections between couple, are discouraged <b>and</b> <b>frowned</b> upon, and might led to a legal problem. Carefulness and discretion is highly required, especially for unmarried couple and LGBT travellers.|$|E

Forty-six infants were presented pairs of facial expressions, and their preferential looking time was recorded.

500|$|Since most midshipmen {{were from}} the gentry or had family {{connections}} with sailing ships, many used their connections to have their names placed on a ship's books. The practice, known colloquially as [...] "false muster" [...] was common {{even though it was}} technically illegal <b>and</b> <b>frowned</b> upon. This allowed some boys to be promoted to midshipmen, or in some cases lieutenant, without having completed the required amount of time at sea. A notable example was Thomas Cochrane, whose uncle had him entered at the age of five; his name was carried on various ships until he was 18 and received his commission.|$|E
500|$|Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "the footage {{looks like}} a remake of Trainspotting, and, [...] matches its thumping rave beat to footage that often {{looks like a}} remake of Trainspotting". Amanda Dobbins of New York {{magazine}} was more critical of the video; she criticized Rihanna's undressing in a farmer's field as [...] "the least of its provocations" [...] and listed the activities the couple partake in: [...] "smoking, drinking, dancing on fast-food tables, dancing at raves, heavy petting, stealing groceries, drunk wheelies, and bathing while fully clothed [...] candy-colored drugs". Dobbins noted that the list of illicit <b>and</b> <b>frowned</b> upon activities may aggravate parents and committees because of the explicit nature of the video, which caused controversy for Rihanna in her videos for [...] "S" [...] and [...] "Man Down". Charlotte Cowles of the same publication commented that the voice-over provided by Deyn {{at the start of}} the video sounded [...] "incredibly depressing".|$|E
500|$|Hemingway habitually {{used the}} word [...] "and" [...] in place of commas. This use of polysyndeton may serve to convey immediacy. Hemingway's polysyndetonic sentence—or in later works his use of {{subordinate}} clauses—uses conjunctions to juxtapose startling visions and images. [...] Benson compares them to haikus. Many of Hemingway's followers misinterpreted his lead <b>and</b> <b>frowned</b> upon all expression of emotion; Saul Bellow satirized this style as [...] "Do you have emotions? Strangle them." [...] However, Hemingway's intent was not to eliminate emotion, but to portray it more scientifically. Hemingway {{thought it would be}} easy, and pointless, to describe emotions; he sculpted collages of images in order to grasp [...] "the real thing, the sequence of motion and fact which made the emotion and which would be as valid in a year or in ten years or, with luck and if you stated it purely enough, always". This use of an image as an objective correlative is characteristic of Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, and Proust. Hemingway's letters refer to Proust's Remembrance of Things Past several times over the years, and indicate he read the book at least twice.|$|E

500|$|In 1977, de Lucía married Casilda Varela, the {{daughter}} of General Varela; they had three children. He released his final album, Castillo de Arena with Camarón de la Isla, The lyrics were written by Antonio Sánchez, {{with the exception of}} the bulerías Samara, which Sánchez and de la Isla wrote together. This would be his last LP with a singer for at least 15 years. He reportedly said that the human voice is [...] "naturally too limited" [...] and that he prefers the exploration of different instrumentalists; he also said a busy schedule was the reason for lack of recordings with singers. He performed extensively across the US and Europe during this period, increasing his popularity outside Spain and the flamenco community in Europe, and met many jazz, Latin and other musicians who continued to influence de Lucía's evolution as a [...] "Nuevo flamenco" [...] player. He began to show a very keen interest in jazz fusion and rock, and in 1977 performed with Carlos Santana in the Plaza de toros de las Arenas bullring in Barcelona. He was invited by Al Di Meola to record on his [...] "Mediterranean Sundance" [...] piece for his album Elegant Gypsy. Despite considerable new interest in flamenco and de Lucía's playing generated by the album, traditionalist flamenco critics did not approve of the piece and hated that many people considered Mediterranean Sundance flamenco music <b>and</b> <b>frowned</b> upon de Lucía. Di Meola informed the critics not to worry and that [...] "Paco is not leaving flamenco, but expanding it." [...] In 1978, Paco and his brothers recorded Interpreta a Manuel de Falla, a classical effort of compositions by Manuel de Falla.|$|E
500|$|From 1953 to 1967, O'Hara had a {{relationship}} with Enrique Parra, a wealthy Mexican politician and banker. She met him at a restaurant during a trip to Mexico in 1951. O'Hara stated that Parra [...] "saved me from the darkness of an abusive marriage and brought me back into the warm light of life again. Leaving him {{was one of the most}} painful things I have ever had to do." [...] As her relationship with Parra progressed, she began to learn Spanish and even enrolled her daughter in a Mexican school. She moved in 1953 to a smaller property at 10677 Somma Way in Bel Air, amid frequent visits to Mexico City, where she and Parra were very well-known celebrities. She hired a detective to follow Parra in Mexico and found that he was being fully honest about the relationship with his ex-wife and that she could trust him. John Ford intensely disliked Parra, and it affected her relationship with Ford in the 1950s as he often interfered in her affairs <b>and</b> <b>frowned</b> upon the demise of her marriage to Price, being a devout Catholic like O'Hara. Price also continued to harass O'Hara for dating Parra and filed a case against her on 20 June 1955, seeking custody of Bronwyn and accusing her of immorality. O'Hara filed a countersuit, charging him with contempt of court for refusing to pay $50 a month in child support and a $7 a month alimony. During the publicity stage of The Long Gray Line in 1955, Ford insulted O'Hara and her brother Charles when he remarked to Charles, [...] "if that whore sister of yours can pull herself away from that Mexican long enough to do a little publicity for us, the film might have a chance at some decent returns".|$|E

2500|$|Consorts of the Holy Roman Emperors {{were given}} the title of Holy Roman Empress. The throne was {{reserved}} for males, thus {{there was never a}} Holy Roman Empress regnant, though women such as Theophanu and Maria Theresa of Austria, controlled the power of rule and served as de facto Empresses regnant. [...] A liberal-minded autocrat, she was a patron of sciences and education and sought to alleviate the suffering of the serfs. She kept Catholic observance at court <b>and</b> <b>frowned</b> on Judaism and Protestantism. She reigned for 40 years, and mothered 16 children including Marie-Antoinette, the ill-fated Queen of France. With her husband she founded the Catholic Habsburg-Lorraine Dynasty who remained central players in European politics into the 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|In 1881, the {{reforming}} Tsar Alexander II {{was assassinated}} by Russian populists in Saint Petersburg. His successor Alexander III {{was much more}} autocratic <b>and</b> <b>frowned</b> on any expression of national independence {{as a threat to}} his empire. In an effort to introduce more central control, he abolished the Caucasus Viceroyalty, reducing Georgia's status to that of any other Russian province. Study of the Georgian language was discouraged and the very name [...] "Georgia" [...] ( [...] , [...] ) was banned from newspapers. In 1886, a Georgian student killed the rector of the Tbilisi seminary in protest. When the ageing Dimitri Kipiani criticised the head of the Church in Georgia for attacking the seminary students, he was exiled to Stavropol, where he was mysteriously murdered. Many Georgians believed his death was the work of tsarist agents and mounted a huge anti-Russian demonstration at his funeral.|$|E
2500|$|On {{orders from}} Ioan Lahovary, he also began researching a tract {{on the history}} of the Jews in Romania. Published in French as La Roumanie et les Juifs, under the pen name [...] "Verax", then {{translated}} by Rosetti himself into English, it doubled as a polemic with the Alliance Israélite Universelle. According to Radu Jr, who helped his father with statistics, the work responded to [...] "the Jewish campaign against Romania" [...] and [...] "upset Jews both local and foreign." [...] He argues that the [...] "utterly objective" [...] brochure defended Romanian antisemitism as economic protection rather than racial prejudice. The work insisted that Jewish emancipation was not an option, [...] "focus attention on the direct contact between Jews and the Romanian peasantry". However, it also included respectful tributes to perceived Jewish talents, noting that it was [...] "impossible to speak ill of the craftsman of this race", [...] "a tireless worker [...] leaves no room for criticism"; Radu Jr notes that his family viewed Jews overall as a danger, but that they welcomed assimilated Jews <b>and</b> <b>frowned</b> upon violent antisemitism.|$|E
