40|$|This book {{collects}} {{the proceedings}} of the 2012 Abel Symposium, held at the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, Oslo. The Symposium, and this book, are focused on two important fields of modern mathematical analysis: operator-related function theory and time-frequency analysis; and the profound interplay between them. Among the original contributions and overview lectures gathered here <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> presenting multifractal analysis as a bridge between geometric measure theory and signal processing; local and global geometry of Prony systems and Fourier reconstruction of piecewise-smooth functions;  Bernstein's problem on weighted polynomial approximation; singular distributions and symmetry of the spectrum; and many others. Offering a selection of the latest and most exciting results obtained by world-leading researchers, the book will benefit scientists working in Harmonic and Complex Analysis, Mathematical Physics and Signal Processing...|$|E
40|$|Orthopaedic specialists should {{completely}} and sequentially manage osteoarthritis, from the onset to the prosthesis, with no attitude of resignation, complying with {{national and international}} Guidelines (GLs) and abiding by the criteria of appropriateness of drugs, rehabilitation and orthopaedic device prescription, {{in line with the}} ethics of the medical profession. The GLs <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> that rationalises the quantity of existing information for a disease, without abusing the decision of the doctor; a large volume of scientific knowledge is concentrated in a format that is easily accessible to doctors when carrying out their work. The use of drugs has taken on a connotation of a rational and multifactorial choice, rather than an accidental and incremental choice - inspired only by safety, rather than efficacy criteria. The Notes compiled by the Italian Medicines Agency - a legal instrument to define the reimbursability of medicines and, therefore, an instrument for managing pharmaceutical expenditure 9 ̆ 6 are, in reality, a means to guarantee the appropriateness of the use of medicines, orienting the therapeutic choices according to established Guidelines. In the specific case of osteoarthritis, the knowledge of the GLs is the most appropriate and complete approach towards the disease, in the context of its pathogenetic complexity in its natural history. Moreover, pharmacological treatment of the subchondral osteometabolic damage becomes necessary when documented by magnetic resonance or a scintigraphy; the bone-related pain cannot be challenged through symptomatic analgesic treatment alone...|$|E
30|$|At the {{reference}} site N 1 {{of the river}} Nidda the ecotoxicological status class {{of the water and}} sediment was good (class 2) and moderate (class 3), respectively. The worse status class of the sediment could be due to the Nidda river dam upstream N 1 [52] and the resulting exposure to contaminated sediments. In addition, the input of contaminated sediments from agricultural land is also conceivable. At the same site, the ecological status classes for fish and MZB were evaluated as good [50, 51]. Here, the ecotoxicological status class is worse than the ecological status class. This illustrates that, although there is a relevant chemical contamination of the sediment, this does not affect the species community of fish and MZB, indicating that the good hydromorphological conditions can partially compensate for the chemical contamination. Between sites N 1 and N 2 there <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> mill and two WWTPs (35, 000 and 7500 PE) discharging into the Nidda, and both sites are surrounded by intensive agriculture. These all potentially contribute to the deterioration of the ecotoxicological condition of sediment and water at site N 2 in comparison to N 1. The water and sediment at N 2 are only in a poor ecotoxicological condition (class 4), while the ecological status class for MZB has been assessed as bad (class 5) [51]. Since the ecological status is only slightly worse than the ecotoxicological status class for water and sediment, it can be assumed that the high biological effects in water and sediment are probably caused by chemical contaminants and thus represent the dominant factor for the bad ecological status and structural deficits play just a minor role. At this point, however, it has to be considered that the MZB is exposed to pollutants over the entire life cycle, whereas gammarids and snails were only exposed in the river for 28  days during active biomonitoring campaigns in the present study. Therefore, the ecotoxicological condition is rather a conservative estimate of the actual biological effects caused by the chemical contamination and it cannot be excluded that the chemical stressors have caused the bad ecological status class for the MZB. To achieve an improvement of the ecological condition at N 2, chemical contamination should be reduced in priority, for example by a reduction of the clearwater (i.e., treated wastewater) proportion in the river or by the application of more effective wastewater treatment technologies [29, 53, 54]. In addition, measures should also be implemented to reduce the impact of intensive agriculture on water bodies (e.g., larger riparian strips, extensification of agricultural land). Between sampling sites N 2 and N 3 the Horloff enters the Nidda. The inflow of the river Horloff seems to have a dilution effect, so that the ecotoxicological status classes of water and sediment each improve by one status class. Nevertheless, the water and sediment quality are only moderate (class 3), so there is still a need for action to reduce chemical contamination. Since no data is available for the ecological status of MZB and fish at this site, no statement can be made regarding the relative proportion of the chemical contamination compared with other stressors. Sampling site N 4 is located within a restored area below two WWTPs (30, 000 and 12, 000 PE) and is surrounded by intensive agricultural land. No improvement of the water and sediment quality at this site can be observed and the ecotoxicological status classes thus remain in a moderate condition (class 3). The ecological status class for MZB was also assessed as moderate (class 3), while the ecological condition of fish was poor (class 4) [50, 51]. Thus, the comparison again indicates a dominant contribution of chemical stressors to the moderate (MZB) or poor condition (fish) of the biological quality components, irrespective of the fact that site N 4 is already in a restored area.|$|E
