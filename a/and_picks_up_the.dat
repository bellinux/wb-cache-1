Grandview Parkway runs between the Boardman River and the bay. Near the mouth of the river, US31/M-37/M-72 turns to follow Front Street along the remainder of the bay's shoreline. At Garfield Avenue, M-37 turns northward to run up the Old Mission Peninsula, and US31/M-72 continues across the base of the peninsula to the East Arm of the Grand Traverse Bay. The highway runs north of the Cherry Capital Airport near the east arm as it angles southeasterly to Traverse City State Park.

The chief summons Brian and Charlie to his office where he demands the former to come clean with them but Brian is defiant, forcing the chief to remind him that his brother saw the whole thing. Charlie denies this at first but when the chief threatens to take punitive action against him as well <b>and</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phone, he tells them where his brother hid the money, forcing Brian to surrender his badge and gun. Enraged at his brother for rolling on him, Brian physically assaults Charlie later in the police station's parking garage and then makes a quick getaway in a pickup truck driven by La Torre. While recovering at the hospital, Charlie finds solace with a kind and beautiful nurse named Cathy, played by Cathy Baron, {{and the two of them}} later get married. However, the film then rolls into the song “Midnight Lullaby” as Cathy is seen screaming and crying in agony as she dies during childbirth, leaving Charlie to raise their child alone.|$|E

The creek's source {{is also on the}} eastern edge of Mount Yeager. It flows northwest for a short distance before passing through Olympus Pond and turning west. For the next several miles the creek continues in this direction, running through Pennsylvania State Game Lands #18 and receiving tributaries such as Reilly Creek and Little Nescopeck Creek A. Eventually, the creek passes the northwestern edge of Mount Yeager and continues into Butler Township. [...] Here, the creek heads southwest at a more southerly angle, crossing Interstate 80, receiving Oley Creek, and passing an area of strip mines.

After a number of miles, the creek meanders into Black Creek Township , where it turns north <b>and</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> tributary Black Creek right before crossing Interstate 80 and flowing through a gap in Nescopeck Mountain. In the gap, the creek crosses from Black Creek Township into Nescopeck Township, where it meanders northwest, passing the borough of Nescopeck and entering the Susquehanna River on the border between Nescopeck Township and Columbia County.|$|E
500|$|Erin Mullally {{was cast}} in the role and began filming {{immediately}} after Sorensen's departure from the production. In {{a statement from the}} press office at Five, they stated: [...] "As the character of Declan is extremely popular, and with some sensational storylines planned, it was decided that the character would be recast" [...] Sorensen expressed his delight that his character would continue {{as a part of the}} series saying: [...] "I'm really happy the character's going to continue because the producers and writers have given Declan some fantastic storylines. I'm really proud he's become as popular as he has." [...] At the time it was noted that recasts have occurred repeatedly throughout the history of the programme, creator of Neighbours, Reg Watson previously explained why he thought recasts were quintessential in the show saying: [...] "I always believed it was a pity, when actors chose to leave a serial that the character should go as well. A lot of time and money is invested in the character so we decided to recast if the character was important to the future of the storyline and the show itself." [...] It was this explanation that backed up Declan's recast. Sorensen also explained that the hand-over process would be simple adding: [...] "It'll be nothing over the top. I'm Declan one day and the next day it's Erin. Pretty simple. That's how it works, I can't continue, so Erin comes in <b>and</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> baton. I think it's easier for the viewers to accept when it's a simple change-over." [...] The recast had also upset fans of the character under the portrayal of Sorensen, in response to this he said: [...] "Erin will come in and play his version of Declan, he can't play it exactly as I do and I and the producers would never expect him to do it any other way. All I can say to the Declan supporters is that Erin will be terrific, give him a go, you'll be surprised." ...|$|E
