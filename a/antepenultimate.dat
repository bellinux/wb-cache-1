5|$|Intonation in {{indicative}} clauses usually rises on the <b>antepenultimate</b> syllable, {{falls on}} the penult and rises on the last syllable. Interrogative intonation rises on the penultimate and {{falls on the}} last syllable.|$|E
5|$|Greenlandic prosody {{does not}} include stress as an {{autonomous}} category; instead, prosody is determined by tonal and durational parameters. Intonation is influenced by syllable weight: heavy syllables are pronounced {{in a way that}} may be perceived as stress. Heavy syllables include syllables with long vowels and syllables before consonant clusters. The last syllable is stressed in words with fewer than four syllables and without long vowels or consonant clusters. The <b>antepenultimate</b> syllable is stressed in words with more than four syllables that are all light. In words with many heavy syllables, syllables with long vowels are considered heavier than syllables before a consonant cluster.|$|E
5|$|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is {{a fantasy}} novel written by J. K. Rowling {{and the fifth}} and <b>antepenultimate</b> novel in the Harry Potter series. It follows Harry Potter's struggles through his fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, {{including}} the surreptitious return of the antagonist Lord Voldemort, O.W.L. exams, and an obstructive Ministry of Magic. The novel was published on 21 June 2003 by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom, Scholastic in the United States, and Raincoast in Canada. Five million copies were sold in the first 24 hours of publication. It is the longest book of the series.|$|E
5|$|The Third Epistle of John, often {{referred}} to as Third John and written 3 John, is the <b>antepenultimate</b> book of the New Testament and attributed to John the Evangelist, traditionally thought to be the author of the Gospel of John and the other two epistles of John. The Third Epistle of John is a private letter composed to a man named Gaius, recommending to him a group of Christians led by Demetrius, which had come to preach the gospel in the area where Gaius lived. The purpose of the letter is to encourage and strengthen Gaius, and to warn him against Diotrephes, who refuses to cooperate with the author of the letter.|$|E
5|$|In Quenya, the {{stressing}} of a syllable is {{predictable and}} non-phonemic (i.e. {{the meaning of}} a word never changes depending on the stress), but it is partly determined by syllable weight. Words of two syllables are stressed on the first syllable. In words of three or more syllables, the stress is on the penultimate syllable if this is heavy, otherwise on the <b>antepenultimate</b> syllable, i.e. the third-to-last syllable. In Quenya, heavy syllables are syllables that contain either a long vowel, a diphthong, or a cluster of two consonants (ll, ld, mm, ss, etc.). Certain combinations of consonants, e.g. ny, ry, are also regarded as heavy. Medially hy and hw are long consonants in Parmaquesta (not colloquially in Tarquesta) and a vowel before them is held to constitute a metrically long syllable. Quenya has also a secondary accent. The placement of stress and the distinction between heavy and light syllables is important in Quenya verse.|$|E

25|$|Sin was a {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Championship Wrestling (WCW) that replaced WCW's January PPV event, Souled Out which was held from 1997 to 2000. Sin was the <b>antepenultimate</b> WCW PPV before the company was absorbed by the World Wrestling Federation (now World Wrestling Entertainment) in March 2001. It took place on January 14, 2001 from the Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Indiana.|$|E
25|$|Stress is {{generally}} predictable in Unami. The rightmost nonfinal strong vowel is stressed, or a strong vowel in final position {{if it is}} {{the only one in the}} word. Often when stress would be expected to fall on the antepenult it is shifted to the penult. This change is found in three conjunct endings: /-ak/, /-at/, and /-an/. In the last case, the accent shifts to the penultimate /-an/ only if it would otherwise fall on an <b>antepenultimate</b> short vowel, and if the consonant between them is voiced.|$|E
25|$|Munsee and Unami {{have similar}} but not {{identical}} inventories of consonants and vowels, {{and have a}} significant number of phonological rules in common. For example, both languages share the same basic rules for assigning syllable weight and stress. However, Unami has innovated by regularizing the assignment of stress in some verb forms so that the penultimate syllable is stressed even when the stress assignment rule would predict stress on the <b>antepenultimate</b> syllable. As well, Unami has innovated relative to Munsee by adding phonological rules that significantly change the pronunciation of many Unami words relative to the corresponding Munsee words.|$|E
25|$|In season five, no new {{characters}} {{joined the}} main cast; however, several characters exited the show: Charlotte was written out {{early in the}} season in episode five, with Daniel being written out later in the <b>antepenultimate</b> episode. Season six saw several cast changes: Juliet was written out in the season premiere while three previous recurring characters were upgraded to starring status. These included Nestor Carbonell as mysterious, age-less Other Richard Alpert; Jeff Fahey as pilot Frank Lapidus; and Zuleikha Robinson as Ajira Airways Flight 316 survivor Ilana Verdansky. Additionally, former cast members Ian Somerhalder, Dominic Monaghan, Rebecca Mader, Jeremy Davies, Elizabeth Mitchell, Maggie Grace, Michelle Rodriguez, Harold Perrineau, and Cynthia Watros made return appearances.|$|E
25|$|In the vineyard, the <b>antepenultimate</b> {{event is}} the harvest {{in which the}} grapes are removed from the vine and transported to the winery to begin the wine making process. In the Northern Hemisphere this is {{generally}} between September and October while in the Southern Hemisphere it is generally between February and April. The time of harvest depends {{on a variety of}} factors-most notably the subjective determination of ripeness. As the grape ripens on the vines, sugars and pH increase as acids (such as malic acid) decrease. Tannins and other phenolics also develop which can affect the flavors and aromas in the resulting wine. The threat of detrimental weather and vine diseases (such as grey rot) can also {{play a role in the}} time table. The balance of all these factors contributes to when a winemaker or vineyard manager decides that it is time to harvest.|$|E
500|$|Proto-Semitic is {{the ancestral}} {{language}} {{of all the}} Semitic languages, and in traditional reconstructions possessed 29 consonants; 6 monophthong vowels, consisting of three qualities and two lengths, , in which the long vowels occurred only in open syllables; and two diphthongs [...] The stress system of Proto-Semitic is unknown but it is commonly described as being much like the system of Classical Latin or the modern pronunciation of Classical Arabic: If the penultimate (second last) syllable is light (has a short vowel followed by a single consonant), stress goes on the <b>antepenultimate</b> (third last); otherwise, it goes on the penultimate.|$|E
2500|$|When in Catalan word stress {{falls in}} the <b>ante{{penultimate}}</b> syllable, in Occitan the stress is moved to the penultimate syllable: for example, Occitan pagina [...] vs. Catalan pàgina , [...] "page". However, some varieties of Occitan (such as around Nice) keep the stress on the <b>antepenultimate</b> syllable (pàgina), and some varieties of Catalan (in Northern Catalonia) put the stress on the penultimate syllable (pagina).|$|E
2500|$|Words are {{generally}} accented on the penultimate syllable, unless the word ends in ka, tra and often na, {{in which case}} they are stressed on the <b>antepenultimate</b> syllable.

2500|$|A {{word with}} final stress is called oxytone (or [...] in {{traditional}} Spanish grammar texts); {{a word with}} penultimate stress is called paroxytone ( [...] or [...] ); a word with <b>antepenultimate</b> stress (stress on the third-to-last syllable) is called proparoxytone (...) [...] A word with preantepenultimate stress (on the fourth last syllable) or earlier {{does not have a}} common linguistic term in English, but in Spanish receives the name [...] (Spanish words can be stressed only on one of the last three syllables, except {{in the case of a}} verb form with enclitic pronouns, such as [...]) All proparoxytones and sobresdrújulas have a written accent mark.|$|E
2500|$|Tariana {{has both}} primary and {{secondary}} stress. [...] Tariana is a pitch-accent language, with stressed syllables indicated by a higher pitch and a greater intensity in pronunciation. Unstressed syllables are undifferentiated from non-stressed syllables except in their intensity. Long vowels are always stressed {{as well as most}} nasal vowels. Otherwise, primary stress may fall on the last three syllables. Penultimate stress in most common in monomorphemic words (e.g. dúpu [...] "a lizard"), but <b>antepenultimate</b> (e.g. képira [...] "bird") and final stress (e.g. yapuratú [...] "long flute used at ritual offering") also occurs. All roots have underlying stress. Prefixes are unstressed, and suffixes may be stressed or unstressed. Suffixes with underlying stress generally cause penultimate stress when they are attached to a root (e.g. máwi [...] "hook"→mawípi [...] "blowgun").|$|E
2500|$|Placement of word {{stress is}} {{determined}} by metrical rules that define a characteristic iambic metrical foot, in which a weak syllable {{is followed by a}} strong syllable. A Foot consists of a minimum of one syllable, and a maximum of two syllables, with each Foot containing a maximum of one Strong syllable. The structure of the metrical Foot defines the domain for relative prominence, in which a Strong syllable is assigned stress because it is more prominent than the weak member of the Foot. Typically, the Strong syllable in the <b>antepenultimate</b> Foot is assigned the primary stress. Strong syllables that do not receive main stress are assigned at least secondary stress. In some dialects, metrically Weak (unstressed) vowels {{at the beginning of a}} word are frequently lost; in the Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe dialects all metrically Weak vowels are deleted. For example, bemisemagak(in) (airplane(s), in the Southwestern Ojibwe dialect) is stressed as [...] in the singular but as [...] in the plural. In some other dialects, metrically Weak (unstressed) vowels, especially [...] "a" [...] and [...] "i", are reduced to a schwa and depending on the writer, may be transcribed as [...] "i", [...] "e" [...] or [...] "a". For example, anami'egiizhigad [...] (Sunday, literally [...] "prayer day") may be transcribed as anama'egiizhigad in those dialects.|$|E
