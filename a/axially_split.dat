Head, capacity and efficiency started to degrade markedly, but the pump turned freely and was relatively smooth. It was disassembled and inspected. All the wear parts, impellers, casing and other components were in like new condition. The impellers were underfiled and the pump returned to service - {{with the same}} unacceptable performance results. A thermal image camera was used to check for hot or cold spots and those images will be presented.

40|$|This study {{compared}} the coronal and apical leakage of AH Plus with gutta-percha {{to that of}} Epiphany with Resilon. Twenty-four single rooted teeth were instrumented and divided into 2 groups according to the solutions for smear layer removal and the obturation materials employed: Group A - 17 % EDTA-T and AH Plus with gutta-percha; Group B - primer and Epiphany with Resilon. The Group B specimens were light-cured in the coronal area for 20 s. The external root surfaces were covered with a double layer of ethyl cyanoacrylate, except for the apical foramen and the cavity access. The teeth were immersed in 0. 5 % methylene blue for 48 h. The specimens were rinsed, dried and <b>axially</b> <b>split</b> for dye penetration measurement with the ImageLab 2. 3 software. The t-test showed no significant differences for coronal leakage between the groups, but {{there were significant differences}} for apical leakage between the groups (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{influence}} of different volumes of 17 % EDTA for final rinse on smear layer removal on the different areas of the root canal. Study design. Forty single-rooted teeth were instrumented using rotary instruments. The teeth were divided into 3 test groups according to the EDTA volume for final rinse (5 mL, 10 mL, 15 mL) and 1 control group (10 mL of 1 % sodium hypochlorite). The roots were <b>axially</b> <b>split</b> into halves, and the smear layer removal from the canals was determined under scanning electron microscope. The data were analyzed using Kruskal Wallis and Dunn tests. Results. The 3 experimental groups showed no statistical difference (P >. 05); however, when the test groups were compared to the control group statistically significant differences were found (P. 05). Conclusions. Based on the results, it appears that a final rinse with 5 mL of EDTA per canal provides good smear layer removal, with root canal walls free of debris and mostly open dentinal tubules in all areas.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the energy absorbing behaviour of <b>axially</b> <b>splitting</b> square metal tubes. Tubes 50 mm square with a variable thickness were pushed slowly against rigid pyramid shaped dies, which had various semi-angles. By pre-cutting 5 mm long slits at the four corners, the tube splits along the corners and curls outward with a certain radius at a constant force. In this energy dissipating system, there are three components: tearing energy, plastic deformation energy and frictional energy. Theoretical analysis of the three energy components is presented. Curl radius is also studied in detail. Good agreement between experiments and theory is obtained. The results show that tubes which both split and curl may be used as efficient, long stroke energy absorbing devices. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a further {{investigation into the}} energy absorbing behaviour of <b>axially</b> <b>splitting</b> and curling square mild steel and aluminium tubes. Both quasi-static and dynamic tests were conducted. A simple quasi-static kinematic model is developed which describes all the main features of the deformation process. It is assumed in this model that cracks start from the four corners and propagate along the axial direction due to continuous fracture/tearing. The free side plates so formed by cracks roll up into four curls with a constant radius. Formulas for the average crush force, curl radius, and the energy absorption are achieved by analysing the &# 039;far-field&# 039; and &# 039;near-tip&# 039; deformation events and the bending moment at the crack tip. This quasi-static model is also extended and used for dynamic cases to explore strain-rate effects in splitting square metal tubes. Solutions are presented and detailed comparisons are made between theoretical predictions and experimental results...|$|R

40|$|The load {{transfer}} mechanisms of cable bolts differ from normal rebar bolts. Cable bolts used in mines are basically steel strands with different constructions {{depending on the}} number of wires or elements and the way that these elements are laid. Tendon bolts (rebar and cable) are normally evaluated for strength and {{load transfer}} properties. The strength of tendon can be carried out by tensile failure tests, while the load transfer strength is evaluated by pull and shear strength tests. Short Encapsulation Pull Testing (SEPT) is used to study of the load transfer capacities of tendons, and can be undertaken both in the laboratory and in situ. A new apparatus known as Minova <b>Axially</b> <b>Split</b> Embedment Apparatus (MASEA) was used to study load-displacement characteristics of smooth versus spiral profile cable bolts. Minova Stratabinder grout was used for encapsulating 400 mm long 19 wire 22 mm diameter superstrand cable in the embedment units. The anchorage of the cable on two sides of the embedment apparatus were intentionally installed at different lengths, to allow the cable to be pulled out {{from one side of the}} anchorage. The spiral wire strand cable bolts achieved higher peak pull-out load at minimum displacement in comparison with smooth surface wire strand. The peak pull out force increased with the age of encapsulation grout. The MASEA was easier to assemble and test at a short period of time, thus allowing quick and repeated tests to be undertaken...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{the long}} service {{expected}} from steam power plant it is not practicable to obtain creep data from prototype installations to assist design against excessive creep. Model techniques, however, allow accelerated creep testing in a laboratory environment, which will produce the required creep information {{in a period of}} weeks rather than years. Models are made of a lead alloy and subjected to the scaled mechanical service loads at room temperature. Similarity conditions, based on the usual stress-strain-time relationships, have been developed which allow the measured strain distribution to be used to predict the strains in the engineering component at any time during its useful service life. This prediction requires only the uniaxial creep characteristics of the model and component materials. At present the technique is limited to constant temperature conditions. A lead-antimony-arsenic alloy has been selected which can be cast in the laboratory, giving good homogeneity, isotropy and fine grain structure; this material shows sufficient creep strain due to conveniently small stresses at room temperature. The steady load stress-strain-time characteristics have been determined from uniaxial tests. The model technique has been used to study simplified steam turbine casings subjected to internal pressure. The shapes tested consisted of <b>axially</b> <b>split,</b> flanged cylinders with domed end closures containing large bossed central bores to simulate the turbine bearings and glands. The loading of the models was due to the bolting forces and due to internal pressure. Strains on the inner and outer surfaces were measured with electric resistance strain gauges...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{investigates the}} axial {{splitting}} and curling behaviour of circular metal tubes. Mild steel and aluminum circular tubes were pressed axially onto {{a series of}} conical dies each with different semi-angle. By pre-cutting eight 5 mm slits which were distributed evenly {{at the lower end}} of each tube, the tube <b>split</b> <b>axially</b> and the strips curled outward. Experiments showed that this mechanism results in a long stroke and a steady load. An approximate analysis is presented which successfully predicts the number of propagated cracks, the curling radius and the force applied. This analysis takes into account ductile tearing of the cracks, plastic bending/stretching and friction. Effects of tube dimensions, semi-angle of the die and friction are discussed in detai...|$|R

Depending on the growth temperature several novel narrow spectral features are observed {{that are related to}} the delta doping procedure, but cannot be attributed to transitions involving conduction electron subbands. The nature of one specific PL feature at 1. 4977 eV is explored in detail. It is present in delta-doped samples grown at low temperatures (480 degrees C) and shows all the characteristics of a bound exciton recombination. Its most conspicuous properties are a strong linear polarization along (110) and a (001) <b>axially</b> symmetric spin <b>splitting</b> in high magnetic fields.

40|$|Results from an {{experimental}} investigation on the mechanical behavior of unidirectional fiber reinforced polymer composites (E-glass/vinylester) with 30 %, 50 % fiber volume fraction under dynamic uniaxial compression are presented. Specimens are loaded {{in the fiber direction}} using a servo-hydraulic material testing system for low strain rates and a Kolsky (split Hopkinson) pressure bar for high strain rates, up to 3000 /s. The {{results indicate that}} the compressive strength of the composite increases with increasing strain rate. Post-test scanning electron microscopy is used to identify the failure modes. In uniaxial compression the specimens are <b>split</b> <b>axially</b> (followed by fiber kink band formation). Based on the experimental results and observations, an energy-based analytic model for studying axial splitting phenomenon in unidirectional fiber reinforced composites is extended to predict the compressive strength of these composites under dynamic uniaxial loading condition...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} approximate {{elastic model}} is presented of the pillar failure mechanism {{in the case}} of multiple underground openings in brittle rocks by parallel equidistant vertical splitting cracks forming slabs, which are assumed to buckle. The failure region is considered to be elliptical in shape with the major axis growing as failure proceeds parallel to the minimum applied principal stress. A modified solution for the potential energy loss due to the presence of an elliptical hole in an infinite elastic space was derived in order to account for multiple openings. This solution, which yields the failure initiation stress and the crack spacing, was achieved by inserting configuration correction factors estimated by considering certain limiting conditions. In order to obtain simple approximate formulae and after considering the blast damage effect, equivalent effective circular holes are assumed for the case of square openings and elliptical holes for the case of rectangular openings. Next, the stable mode of pillar failure was formulated based on the observation that the weak inclusion of the <b>axially</b> <b>split</b> rock mass reduces the stresses for some distance inside the pillar. The stable model was obtained first by computing the elastic stresses outside the failure zone using a circular approximation and then applying a stability criterion based on Huber's classical fracture hypothesis. Comparison of the theoretical results with field data concerning a bauxite mine using room and pillar have indicated reasonable agreement. Furthermore, the scale effect exhibited by the strength and the axial splitting crack spacing was predicted sufficiently well by the above model. © 1995...|$|E
40|$|Objective. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the influence of different final irrigating solutions on dentin permeability and smear layer removal using the same specimens and relate the results obtained. Study design. Forty anterior human teeth were instrumented and divided into 4 groups (n = 10) at the final rinse step, according to the irrigant used: G I (control) - 1 % NaOCl; G II - 17 % EDTA; G III - 17 % EDTAT; and G IV - Biopure MTAD. The canals were filled with 0. 5 % methylene blue and maintained in bottles for 48 hours. The roots were transversally split in coronal, middle, and apical fragments. The specimens were photographed and analyzed regarding dye penetration. The fragments were then <b>axially</b> <b>split</b> and prepared for SEM. The photomicrographs were analyzed and qualified by scores. Results. Only the EDTA-T group exhibited statistical difference in which the apical third had less dentin permeability (P <. 05). When a decalcifying agent was used, smear layer was removed, which did not happen in the NaOCl group. Regarding smear layer removal, differences were found only in the EDTA group in which the apical third presented more smear layer (P <. 05). No correlation was found for both studies (r = 0. 4207). Conclusions. There was not an even relationship between the results from both studies, which inferes that higher or lower dentinal permeability does not necessarily correspond to a higher or lower amount of smear layer. The analysis of dentin permeability and smear layer removal was shown to be a feasible procedure using the same specimens.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this model report is to develop the summary {{cladding}} degradation abstraction {{that will be used}} in the Total System Performance Assessment for the License Application (TSPA-LA). Most civilian commercial nuclear fuel is encased in Zircaloy cladding. The model addressed in this report is intended to describe the postulated condition of commercial Zircaloy-clad fuel as a function of postclosure time after it is placed in the repository. Earlier total system performance assessments analyzed the waste form as exposed UO{sub 2 }, which was available for degradation at the intrinsic dissolution rate. Water in the waste package quickly became saturated with many of the radionuclides, limiting their release rate. In the total system performance assessments for the Viability Assessment and the Site Recommendation, cladding was analyzed as part of the waste form, limiting the amount of fuel available at any time for degradation. The current model is divided into two stages. The first considers predisposal rod failures (most of which occur during reactor operation and associated activities) and postdisposal mechanical failure (from static loading of rocks) as mechanisms for perforating the cladding. Other fuel failure mechanisms including those caused by handling or transportation have been screened out (excluded) or are treated elsewhere. All stainless-steel-clad fuel, which makes up {{a small percentage of the}} overall amount of fuel to be stored, is modeled as failed upon placement in the waste packages. The second stage of the degradation model is the splitting of the cladding from the reaction of water or moist air and UO{sub 2 }. The splitting has been observed to be rapid in comparison to the total system performance assessment time steps and is modeled to be instantaneous. After the cladding splits, the rind buildup inside the cladding widens the split, increasing the diffusion area from the fuel rind to the waste package interior. This model report summarizes the component models, developed for the two stages noted above, that are used as inputs to TSPA-LA. The model concludes that less than two percent of the fuel, including all of the stainless-steel clad fuel, received at the repository is failed (perforated) upon receipt at the repository. All failed fuel is assumed to <b>axially</b> <b>split</b> upon waste package failure exposing the fuel to oxidation from the in-package environment. TSPA-LA then calculates the release of radionuclides from the exposed volume of oxidized fuel...|$|E
