This paper examines these policy intentions in relation to northern England, and incorporates the results of in-depth interviews with policy-makers from RDAs, DTI, DfES and northern Government Offices. Early cluster development has evidently been influenced by existing sector development strategies {{and the need for}} inclusivity in regional partnerships. Clusters have been defined broadly, but engagement with universities has required greater focus on specific regional expertise.

40|$|Infections by Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), in {{particular}} carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKp), {{are a significant}} public health challenge worldwide. Resistance to carbapenems in enterobacteriaceae is linked to different mechanisms, {{in particular}} the production {{of different types of}} enzymes including KPC, VIM, IMP, NDM, and OXA- 48. Despite several attempts to control the spread of these infections at local and national level, epidemiological situation for CRKp had worsened in the last years in the Mediterranean area. The rate and types of CRKp isolates greatly differ in the various Mediterranean countries. KPC-producing K. pneumoniae is diffused particularly in the European countries bordering the Mediterranean sea and is actually endemic in Greece and Italy. On the contrary, OXA- 48 -producing K. pneumoniae is endemic in Turkey and Malta, and diffused <b>at</b> <b>inter-regional</b> <b>level</b> particularly in some north African and Middle East countries.

According to the results, telemedicine networks in Choongbook are dominated by an <b>inter-regional</b> <b>level</b> (in particular, a national level), {{and most of the}} telemedicine networks are observed between clinical sites in Choongbook and tertiary care centers in Kyunggi. In contrast, telemedicine networks in Kagawa are dispersed within the diagnostic boundary of Kagawa at a regional level. Interviews with crucial decision-makers revealed the reasons why many patients enjoy health care via telemedicine <b>at</b> an <b>inter-regional</b> <b>level,</b> which include psychological considerations regarding quality and level of health care services, personal stakes in telemedicine service sites, acceptability and credibility of good tertiary care centers, and easy access to and use of medical institutions. In Kagawa, both the existing health care system and the telemedicine system support the maintenance of stable regional health care within Kagawa. Importantly, human relationships based on the regional health care system contribute to creating telemedicine networks within the original purpose of the telemedicine system regarding regionalization. Also, telemedicine’s technological value, convenience, and utility are associated with the regionalization of telemedicine networks within one diagnostic area...|$|R
40|$|The {{principles}} of the regional development policy at European level were taken into consideration even since 1957 with signing up the Treaty establishing the Economic European Community that stipulates that the Community mission is, among others, to promote throughout the Community a harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of the economic activities, a high labour and social protection, increase of the living standard, economic and social cohesion and solidarity among the Member States. The requirement to ensure a harmonious and balanced development of the Community area by narrowing the gaps between certain regions, contributed to the considerable increase in importance of the EU regional development policy after 1990 and mainly after 2004, with EU enlargement by the 10 former communist countries and after 2007, when Romania and Bulgaria also joined the Union. EU enlargement considerably increased {{the economic and social}} disparities both at regional and national level, and the support was focused on the less developed regions and Member States. At present, the development regions have {{an important role in the}} budgetary allocations of the European Union. The development regions in the Member States are considered a factor promoting the structural policies and they are the direct beneficiaries of the Structural Funds from which the development programs implemented <b>at</b> <b>inter-regional</b> <b>level</b> are funded.

In this paper a cloud framework for spectrum database as a service (SDaaS) for the application layer is introduced. The SDaaS framework can provide {{a wide range of}} vital capabilities needed for unlocking the DSA-based networks: (i) SDaaS can be used as the best short-term solution for minimising any harmful interference that might be introduced to the co-channels and adjacent-channels of the incumbent users subject to a dynamic spectrum sharing policy. Examples of such network architectures are those based on the TV white spaces (TVWS) technologies. (ii) SDaaS {{can be used as a}} toolbox by regulators in the development of efficient dynamic spectrum regulations at a national level.

40|$|This {{paper will}} present {{empirical}} {{evidence on the}} wider spatial-economic impacts of High Speed Trains (HSTs) at the intra-regional level. It represents follow-up research to a previous empirical study <b>at</b> <b>inter-regional</b> <b>level,</b> based on UKIC 125 - an upgraded HST system. The findings suggest that HST has had substantial and demonstrable effects in aiding this transition within a 2 -hour travel limit of London, but that the effects have not been automatic or universal. The need for integrated planning combining transport, economic, and spatial issues to promote dynamic city-region development should not be overlooked. Particularly, the UK is currently situated at the critical turning point considering a long-term commitment to High Speed Two (HS 2) : whether, to what extent, and how {{the arrival of a}} HST hub in a city could act as the agent of change for transforming surrounding sub-regions. Thus, a finer-grained and deeper-probing analysis at the intra-regional scale is needed, in the form of comparative case studies of two post-industrial city-regions. Lille/Pas-de-Calais and the Manchester city-region are chosen, the first {{to examine the effects of}} the TGV after its arrival in 1994, the second to provide a prognosis for Manchester and its neighbouring towns after the projected arrival of HS 2. In the Lille M 9 tropole, the TGV brought about a dramatic change in economic fortunes. But, within the wider Nord-Pas de Calais region, two divergent developmental trajectories of traditional manufacturing industries have increasingly manifested themselves: Lille M 9 tropole has increasingly strengthened its service-based growth, whereas the former coal area and coastal region seems not to have attracted knowledge-based development. In the Manchester city-region, the new generation of 300 k/hr HST lines will undoubtedly in their turn have major spatial-economic impacts as Manchester is brought closer to London with the dramatic shrinking of critical time-distance. The relationship between Manchester and its neighbouring towns may however be negative to poorly connected towns like Burnley which is reflected in its weak economic performance. Overall, this research aims to fill in the gap with empirical evidence of intra-regional impacts of HSTs and disentangle the complex forces and the developmental phases in the dynamic process of city-region regeneration...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to provide {{new insights into}} the nature of Greek society in the Dark Ages (1100 – 700 B. C.). It re-examines the relationship between the archaeological evidence and the institutions and practices described in the Homeric poems. The archaeological evidence indicates that there were marked regional differences in settlement pattern, burial customs and pottery traditions. This must, it is argued, reflect profound regional differences in social organisation. Ethnographic analogies are used to make sense of some of these regional patterns. Two of the larger and more stable communities in Dark Age Greece, Athens and Knossos, are subjected to detailed scrutiny. A close contextual analysis of the relationship between pot style and mortuary representations in these two sites reveal two patterns which are divergent rather than convergent. In Athens burial customs and later pot style appear to be part of an age and sex linked symbolic system. In Knossos however, there is no clear patterning, either in pot style or mortuary representations. Instead there is a continuum of variation. Such fundamental differences cannot be accomodated within the concept of a uniform ‘Homeric Society’. It is suggested here that the institutions and practices described in Homer only operated <b>at</b> an <b>inter-regional</b> <b>level...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the Contadora and Esquipulas phases of the Central American peace process of the 1980 s as inter-related case studies that provide {{important}} insights into the interests, capabilities, and limits of contemporary Latin American diplomacy and foreign policy making. By reconstructing and analyzing the diplomacy of the regional peace process, this study seeks to understand why it persisted for as long as it did despite tremendous political obstacles and expectations of failure. This study shows that the peace process is rooted in the diplomatic traditions of Latin America, but it emerged and persisted because of the development of the new interests, capabilities, and diplomatic innovations of several Latin American states. ^ To understand the lessons of the Central American peace process, this work opens with the study of the traditions and historical development of Latin American diplomacy through the 1970 s and up to the emergence of political crisis and war in Central America. Then it focuses on reconstructing the significant phases and diplomatic events of the Contadora and Esquipulas peace processes and examines their central documents. Finally, it analyzes the specific foreign policy interests, capabilities, and contributions of four states actively involved in the peace process, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, and Costa Rica, in order to understand the nature of contemporary Latin American diplomacy and its import to both the persistence of the peace process and the future of inter-American relations. ^ This study 2 ̆ 7 s primary level of analysis is <b>at</b> the <b>inter-regional</b> <b>level,</b> focusing on Latin American diplomacy, however, factors at the systemic and societal levels of analysis also receive considerable attention.

In the end, this study seeks a deeper understanding and appreciation of the foreign policy interests and diplomatic capabilities of our Latin American neighbors. ...|$|R
40|$|Banana is a crop {{of major}} {{importance}} in the African Great Lakes Region, because {{of the food and}} cash it provides to about 85 % of the population. Despite the management efforts of smallholder farmers, on-farm banana yields are low. Low yields are mainly attributed to poor soil fertility and limited input use, drought or irregular rainfall, pests and diseases and inappropriate management practices. Relying on observations on banana plants, crop management, pests and soils in various agro-ecoregions in Rwanda and South-West Uganda, this PhD-thesis contributes {{to the understanding of the}} traditional banana-based systems by (1) ranking constraints and quantifying associated yield losses, (2) evaluating the temporal and spatial variations of soil nutrient pools, (3) relating soil fertility to the mineralogical and organic components of the soil. Hence, a Boundary Line Analysis on the available data shows that the gap between actual production and attainable yield may attain 70 - 96 % and that poor soil fertility is an overall problem in the Great Lakes Region. Further analysis of plant foliar data highlights associated nutritional disorders. Banana production does not only vary at regional scale in function of soils and parent materials, but also changes <b>at</b> <b>inter-regional</b> or intra-farm <b>level.</b> Within-farm differences may relate to differential management of organic matter. In order to assess the human imprint on soil fertility, organic matter and soil minerals are evaluated as nutrient providers and as contributors to the cation exchange capacity of the soil. These analyses quantify soil mineral abundances and emphasize the key role of organic matter in maintaining soil fertility. (AGRO 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of the determinants of inter-regional knowledge flows has received a growing interest in the recent past. Particularly, the {{question of}} the relationship between geography and networks has been debated. Yet, <b>at</b> the <b>inter-regional</b> <b>level,</b> there is no study assessing the effect of networks on the the value of knowledge flows. This may come from the fact that methodological tools assessing network characteristics at the dyadic level are lacking for aggregated networks (such as the network of inter-regional knowledge flows). This paper aims to fill this gap and contribute to the debate on the determinants of knowledge flows. To do so we first define a new measure to assess 'network proximity' {{at the level of the}} regional dyad, based on the concept of inter-regional bridging path. Here a bridging path is a path at the micro-level between two regions via a third one. For instance, if an agent from region B has collaborated with an agent from region A and an agent from region C, then there is a bridging path between A and C via B. By using the information at the aggregated level, and assuming a 'random matching process' of the agents at the micro level, we are able to derive a closed form of the total expected number of bridging paths between two given regions. By the concept of triadic closure at the micro-level, the regional pairs having a high number of bridging paths should be more prone to collaborate. We then illustrate the measure theoretically defined by making use of co-publications data from chemistry journals for the period 2001 - 2005, within the five largest European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom). The studied network is then composed of all the regional pairs among 386 active NUTS 3 regions. Using a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model along gravity equations, we then assess the effect of geographical distance, spatial contiguity and national borders. We also assess the effect of 'network proximity' by using the expected number of bridging paths as a proxy. As in previous studies, the effects of the geographical distance or the national borders are negative. But we show that the measure of 'network proximity' has a positive and significant effect. All the more, it also significantly alleviates the impeding effect of national borders on cross-countries collaborations, then suggesting that 'network proximity' is a channel favored for international collaborations...|$|R
40|$|Upper Silesia and the Ruhr {{are two of}} {{the most}} {{important}} agglomerations in Europe. Both regions are not only of economic importance for their countries but also involved in an economic structural change. Whereas it started in the Ruhr area {{at the end of the}} 50 s with the coal crisis, the process begun belated in the Upper Silesia in 1993 after the fall of the communism and the end of the COMECON in 1991. Therefore Upper Silisia was confronted with the challenges of the economic structural change over 30 years later. Hence both regions are suitable for a comparison and the verification of the developed methods related to the time lag of their development. Primary objective of this research project is not a descriptive comparison of both study areas but rather the identification of cities with similar characteristics and the visualization of topic interconnectivities in the main research areas. The research results of Pittsburgh and surrounding cities had been used to implement transatlantic experiences in the field of economic structural change and a view on different forms of cooperation. The comparison of such complex entities like agglomerations is also a challenge to the methods used. Therefore the application and development of proper tools is imperative. This is the secondary objective of this work together with the identification and inquiry of proper data. The latter consists of statistical data, expert interviews, surveys, press analysis and spatial data. The data collected was mainly analyzed with Geographic Information Systems and complex multivariate statistical methods. The key research statement is on the one hand the development and use of complex methods, and on the other hand the recognition of different topic interconnectivities in Upper Silesia and the Ruhr as well as the identification of similar city clusters in both research areas. It was shown that the use of geographic information systems and complex, multidimensional statistical methods successfully helps to achieve the research objectives. Especially the correspondence analysis proved to be an effective method for integral interview and survey analysis and the identification of specific city clusters. Due to the method scalability it is also possible to change the extent of the analysis. Respective to the regional analysis Upper Silesia is confronted with more social rather than economic problems. The often discussed economic decoupling of the Ruhr compared to other old industrial regions in Europe couldn’t be verified.

This article reviews {{the current state of}} an alternative approach that aims at unraveling the causes and functional principles of hemispheric specialization in terms of asymmetries in connectivity. Starting with an overview of the historical origins of the concept of lateralization, we briefly review recent evidence from anatomical and developmental studies that asymmetries in structural connectivity may be a critical factor shaping hemispheric specialization. These differences in anatomical connectivity, which are found both at the intra- and <b>inter-regional</b> <b>level,</b> are likely to form the structural substrate of different functional principles of information processing in the two hemispheres. The main goal {{of this article is to}} describe how these functional principles can be characterized using functional neuroimaging in combination with models of functional and effective connectivity. We discuss the methodology of established models of connectivity which are applicable to data from positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging and review published studies that have applied these approaches to characterize asymmetries of connectivity during lateralized tasks. Adopting a model-based approach enables functional imaging to proceed from mere descriptions of asymmetric activation patterns to mechanistic accounts of how these asymmetries are caused...|$|R
40|$|What {{explains}} {{multilateral cooperation}} {{leading to the}} free movement of labor? I examine the ability of two theories of regime formation (structural and game-theoretic approaches) and of two theories of integration (supranationalism and intergovernmentalism) to account for such cooperation. Based on a review of attempts to promote cooperation at the regional and <b>inter-regional</b> <b>levels,</b> and on a more detailed analysis of two case studies (the EU and ECOWAS), I demonstrate {{that none of the}} four theories adequately explains how multilateral cooperation with regards to the free movement of labor emerges. I then offer an alternative model, which highlights bargaining between the countries of origin and those of destination. I assert that countries of origin are likely to support the free movement of labor, while countries of destination are likely to oppose it. Multilateral cooperation is achieved when the countries of destination agree to the free movement of labor, and in return, the countries of origin grant the former unrestricted entry into their markets, and/or accept their leadership status. This kind of cross-issue linkage mainly develops in regional integration schemes. I further explain the factors contributing to the durability of cooperation on the free movement of labor, and the paradoxical finding that the multilateral agreements most likely to emerge and survive are the ones that contribute the least to economic efficiency...|$|R

40|$|In Africa, for {{the control}} of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), more {{information}} is needed on {{the spread of the}} disease at local, regional and <b>inter-regional</b> <b>level.</b> The aim of this review is to identify the role that animal husbandry, trade and wildlife have on the transmission of FMD and to provide a scientific basis for different FMD control measures in Africa. Review of literature, published reports and databases shows that there is more long distance spread of FMD virus serotypes within North, West, Central and East Africa than in southern Africa. In North, West, Central and East Africa migratory animal husbandry systems often related with search for grazing and water as well as trade are practiced {{to a greater extent than}} in southern Africa. In southern Africa, the role of African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is more extensively studied than in the other parts of Africa, but based on the densities of African buffalo in Central and East Africa, one would assume that buffalo should also play a role in the epidemiology of FMD in this part of Africa. More sampling of buffalo is necessary in West, Central and East Africa. The genetic analysis of virus strains has proven to be valuable to increase our understanding in the spread of FMD in Africa. This review shows that there is a difference in FMD occurrence between southern Africa and the rest of the continent; this distinction is most likely based on differences in animal husbandry and trade systems. Insufficient data on FMD in wildlife outside southern Africa is limiting our understanding on the role wildlife plays in the transmission of FMD in the other buffalo inhabited areas of Africa. </p...|$|R
40|$|The EU {{is now a}} {{major player}} in {{globalization}} due to its economic power and position in trade relations. The enlargement has led to a higher IR profile for the EU and EU external diplomacy has been deeply affected by the events surrounding 9 / 11. At the same time economic development and transition politics have also transformed regional and international relations among the Asian states over the past two decades. Europe and Asia are therefore two major centres for the development of multi-polar and multi-lateral relations.

40|$|The {{importance}} of entrepreneurship as {{a driving force}} in the economic development has been widely recognised. Respectively, {{a growing number of}} empirical studies have focused on explaining variation in entrepreneurial activity at various spatial levels with the majority of them taking either a cross-country perspective or looking <b>at</b> the <b>inter-regional</b> differences. More recent studies on entrepreneurship have shifted their focus to examining cross-city variation in entrepreneurship. However, overall, given limited city-level data availability, scarce work has been undertaken so far on cross-city entrepreneurship within the spatially oriented entrepreneurship research. Furthermore, to our best knowledge, no empirical studies exist on entrepreneurship in European cities and our paper aims to fill this ga...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{identifies}} {{and discusses}} some fundamental changes {{that took place}} during the middle neolithic period in Sweden, with the introduction of the Boat Axe Culture. The possibility of intrepreting the Corded Ware Cultures by way of networks, identified through the regional designes of battle axes, are proposed. With the aid of a reconsideration of the typology of the Swedish boat axes, ethnographic examples of gift-exchanges, and a theoretical reappraisal of the implications of archaeological praxis for prehistorc life-worlds, new possibillities for interpreting the changing role of such prestige items as the boat-axes are presented. A new chronological scheme is also presented for the Swedish boat axes, with a tripartite division of the latter middle neolithic into MN BI-III. The value of the boat axe is further considered to be explicable only in terms of a prestige item, dependent on a system of exchange for its continual valuation. Central to this discussion is the relationship between value and exchange. Several regions within the Swedish Boat Axe Culture are identified, and the boat axes in two of these regions {{in the southern part of}} the Mälar valley are thoroughly examined. It is shown that during the cours of the Boat Axe period, the emphasis gradually changed from a regional to an intra-regional focus concerning the development of types and special designes of the boat axes. Identified similarities and dissimilarities of contemporary boat axes within and between regions are explained as a result of a parallel change in gift exchanges, from a regional focus to an intra-regional focus. An hierarchical ordering of the latter middle neolithic soceity is also identified, where only a portion of the boat-axes were selected as burial gifts. This development is chartered onto the broader neolithic development in Sweden, with special focus on the role of prestige items such as battle axes. A fundamental change is identified as taking place during the Boat Axe period, when the full implications of a prestige economy were implemented and the major strategies for power settled on the <b>inter-regional</b> <b>level...</b>|$|R
