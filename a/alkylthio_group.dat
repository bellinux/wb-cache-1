The results indicate that the generally accepted mechanism, C-H oxidative addition followed by hydrometallation and reductive elimination, is the most favorable pathway. The intermolecular hydroacylation reaction of acetylene is shown to suffer from three problems: (1) the formation of a stable bis-acetylene intermediate, which leads to a facile dimerization side-reaction; (2) higher activation barrier of the rate-determining C-H (carbonyl) bond activation; and (3) "fatal" easy decarbonylation from hydrometalated intermediate and subsequent reductive elimination to give decarbonylation product.

Several conformations corresponding to different deformations of the porphyrin core and to different orientations of the alkylthio groups have been theoretically explored. The nearly degenerate, purely ruffled D 2 d and hybrid (ruffled with a modest degree of saddling) D 2 conformations, both characterized by an up−down (ud) orientation of the vicinal methylthio groups {{are by far the}} preferred conformations in the “gas phase”. In contrast to NiOEP, it is the orientation of the peripheral substituents rather than the type and degree of distortions of the porphyrin core that determines the stability of the NiOMTP conformers. The ground-state electronic absorption spectra of NiOMTP exhibit significant changes compared to its parent NiP and β-alkylated analogues, such as NiOEP, resulting in a considerable red shift of the B and the Q bands, intensification and broadening of the Q band, and additional weak absorptions in the region between the Q and B bands. These spectral changes can be understood in terms of the electronic effects of the methylthio groups with nonplanar distortions of the porphyrin ring playing a very minor role. Transient absorption measurements with sub-picosecond resolution performed in toluene and TDDFT calculations reveal that following photoexcitation, NiOMTP deactivates by the pathway 1 (π,π*) → 3 (dz 2,dx 2 -y 2) → ground state. The (d,d) state exhibits complex spectral evolution over ca. 8 ps, interpreted in terms of vibrational relaxation and cooling. The cold ligand-field excited state decays with a lifetime of 320 ps.

The measured carrier mobility of the alkoxy-containing polymers was 12 orders of magnitude higher than that of the alkylthio-containing polymers.

40|$|The {{reported}} work on {{the reactions}} between indoles and arylsulphonyl azides was extended {{with a view to}} identifying any intermediates involved and establishing the relationships between the products formed. The effect of varying the structures of the indoles on these products has also been investigated. Compounds of type (I) appear to be key intermediates in the reactions of alkyl indoles with azides. Compound (I) has recently been prepared. The suggested intermediacy of this compound in the reaction between tosyl azide and 9 -methyltetrahydrocarbazole was proved, the reaction of (I) with p -chlorobenzenesulphonyl azide yielding (II). As an extension of the work on tetrahydrocarbazoles, the reactions of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 -hexahydrocyclohept[b]indole, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 -hexahydro- 5 H -cyclooct[b]indole and their N -methyl derivatives have been examined. From the reactions of the N -H compounds have been isolated the products (III, n = 5, Z = Ts), (III, n = 6, Z = Ts) and (III, n = 6, Z = Cbs). The action of heat on (III, n = 6, Z = Ts) has been investigated and the products (IV) and (V) isolated. In acetic acid solution (III, n = 6, Z = Ts) was oxidised to (VI); a plausible mechanism for this oxidation was proposed. On heating, (VI) isomerised to (VII), and on treatment with base (VI) added water, giving (VIII). 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 -Hexahydro- 5 -methylcyclohept[b]indole gave four products on treatment with tosyl azide, (IXandndash;XII, n = 4). The structures of the latter two products. were proved by degradation to the compounds (XIII) and (XIV), and synthesis of these degradation products. The homologous compounds (IXandndash;XII, n = 5) were obtained when 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 -hexahydro- 5 -methyl- 5 H -cyclooct[b]indole was treated with tosyl azide. The stereochemistry of the compounds (XI, n = 4) and (XI, n = 5) has been determined and the transformation of (X, n = 5) into (XII, n = 5) on heating was demonstrated. Rapoport has reported the high reactivity of indoles with structures of the type (XV), this reactivity being due to a high degree of strain in the molecule. It was of interest, therefore, to extend the present work by synthesising the compounds (XV, n = 4) and (XV, n - 5) and investigating their reactions with arylsulphonyl azides. The former yielded the products (XVI), (XVII), (XVIII, n = 3) and (XIX), depending on the conditions used. From the reaction of p -nitrobenzenesulphonyl azide in methanol a further product (XX) was obtained. The effect of heat on the compounds (XVI) and (XX) has been examined, both yielding (XXI). (XV, n = 5) reacted with azides to give the compounds (XXII) as major product. Also obtained were compounds (XVIII, n = 4) and from the reaction with p -nitrobenzenesulphonyl azide (XXIII) was also isolated. Since {{this was the first time}} that compounds of the type of structure (XXII) had been obtained in good yield, the chemistry of these products was studied in some detail. A number of interesting rearrangements were observed. Treatment with base gave the compounds (XXIV, R = NZ) and (XXIV, R = O), while the effect of acid was to produce the ion (XXV). This was not isolated, products resulting from the addition of hydroxylic solvents to the molecule being the only compounds obtained. A similar rearrangement occurred on heating (XXII) in hydroxylic solvents. The rearrangement in acidic solvent was studied by means of n. m. r. spectroscopy. The reactions of 2 -alkylthioindoles with azides were investigated, the major products being the azobisindoles (XXVI). Prom the reaction of 1 -methyl- 2 -methylthioindole compound (XXVII) was also obtained; the formation of this compound involves a 1, 2 -shift of the <b>alkylthio</b> <b>group.</b> 2 -Indolinethiones gave two products on treatment with arylsulphonyl azides, compounds (XXVIII) and the 1, 2, 3 -thiadiazoles (XXIX).

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{materials}} chemistry, the 1, 3 -dithiole ring system {{is one of the}} most widely investimated and attractive heterocvcles due to its unique redox properties. A large number of new orazanic materials containing this svstem have been developed. The most important examale is tetra-thiafulvalene (TTF) and related electron donors giving organic conductors or superconductors. 2 -Methylene- 1, 3 -dithiole, which is a component of TTF, is considered to give the corresponding cation radical upon one-electron oxidation. In other words, it can be regarded as a source of cation radical species. Thus, introduction of this unit into an appropriate π-electron system is expected to produce various novel redox systems showing interesting properties and reactivities inherent to the configuration and the number of the 1, 3 -dithiole units as well as to the nature of the π-electron system. Therefore, on the development of novel organic functional materials as well as organic conductors, it is worthwhile to prepare such redox systems and study theirproperties. In this thesis, the author designed several novel 1, 3 -dithiole compounds containing thiophene-related systems and investigated their electrochemical properties, reactivities, and crystal structures. The thiophene derivatives were chosen as spacer units for following reasons. (i) The electron-releasing thiophene ring is expected to enhance the electron-donating ability of the molecules and to stabilize the cationic species formed by oxidation. (ii) The expansion of π-conjugation caused by insertion of the thiophene units may reduce intramolecular Coulombic repulsion. (iii) The structural modification is generally easy. The present thesis consists of the following four chapters. Chapter 1 describes the recent studies related to this research work and the purpose and constitution of the thesis. In Chapter 2, 6, 6 -bis[5 -(1, 4 -dithiafulven- 6 -yl) - 2 -thienyl]- 1, 4 -dithiafulvene and its derivatives have been prepared as novel cross-conjugated tris(1, 3 -dithiole) donors, and their physical and chemical properties are discussed. According to MNDO-PM 3 calculations on a parent compound, the molecule takes a nonplanar conformaation, in which one dithiafulvenyl unit is orthogonal to the plane of the 2, 5 -bis(dithiafulvenyl) thiophene skeleton. The cyclic voltammograms (CV) showed that the donors are oxidized to trication radicals or tetracations. The first oxidation waves correspond to two-electron processes, indicating the reduced on-site Coulombic repulsion in the dication State. The electron-donating ability of the donors is estimated to be comparable to that of TTF. The donors gave iodine complexes which showed electrical conductivities of 10 - 5 - 10 - 2 Scm- 1 as comtressed pellets. A redox active polymer was formed from a certain derivative by electrochemical oxidation. Furthermore, the synthesis and redox aroaerties of a tris(1, 3 -dithiole) donor containing a cyclopentadithiophene moiety were also discussed. Chapter 3 deals with the preparation and properties of bis(1, 3 -dithiole) compounds containins thienylmethylene units affording novel cations by oxidation. Molecules possessing a methylene group adjacent to electron-donating moieties seem to undergo deprotonation by oxidation to give the corresponding methyl cations. In order to prove the generality of this type of reaction and to apply it to the preparation of novel cations, bis(1, 3 -dithiole) compounds containing a dithienylmethane skeleton have been prepared. The CV indicated that redox active products were formed through electrochemical oxidation followed by chemical reactions and the reactions were dependent on the substituents R on the C 6 -carbons of the dithiafulvenyl groups. When R was methyl group, chemical oxidation of the compounds with NOBF 4 gave the corresponding dithienylmethyl cations in moderate yields. They were also obtained by hydride abstraction with Ph 3 CBF 4. The cations were characterized by intense absorptions in the near-infrared region (900 - 980 nm in MeCN). The <b>alkylthio</b> <b>groups</b> on the dithiole rings make the absorptions much red-shifted. The absorption band was blue-shifted to ca. 820 nm in a thin film, indicating that they are interesting as near-infrared absorbing dyes. The polymethine cyanine like structure of the cation was revealed by the X-ray analysis. On the other hand, in the case of R=H, a redox active oligomer was formed by oxidation. Furthermore, isolation of the dication salt derived from 2, 5 -bis[5 -(6 -methyl- 1, 4 -dithiafulven- 6 -yl) - 2 -thienylmethyl]thiophene, which has two methylene groups, was also attempted. Although it has been reported that 1, 4 -dithiafulvene derivatives undergo oxidative intermolecular coupling reactions at the 6 -position, the corresponding intramolecular reaction is unknown. Chapter 4 describes the oxidative intramolecular cvclization of 2, 22 ̆ 7 -bis(1, 4 -dithiafulven- 6 -yl) - 3, 32 ̆ 7 -bithienyls. The CVs of the compounds showed that they are irreversibly oxidized to afford redox active aroducts. Chemical oxidation with tris(4 -bromophenyl) aminium hexachloroantimonate gave cyclization products as dication salts in high yields. The X-ray structural analyses of the dication salts revealed that they contain trivalent chloroantimonate ions (Sb 2 Cl 8 2 - and SbCl 5 2 -), suggesting that SbCl 6 - ion acts as an oxidizing agent in the reaction. Chemical reduction of the dication salts with zinc gave the corresponding neutral donors in high yields. According to the X-ray analysis, the molecule adopts a nonplanar structure,with short intramolecular S…S contacts. The CVs of the donors showed reversible one-stage two-electron oxidation waves, and the potentials are fairly low compared with TTF. A tetracyano-quinodimethane complex was formed from one of them...|$|R

Halogen substitution at the 5 - or 6 -position of 2, 4 -diaminoquinazoline favored selective binding to the P. carinii enzyme but not the T. gondii enzyme. For example, the 50 % inhibitory concentrations of 2, 4 -diamino- 6 -chloroquinazoline as an inhibitor of P. carinii, T. gondii, and rat liver dihydrofolate reductase were 3. 6, 14 and 29 microM, respectively, corresponding to 12 -fold selectivity for the P. carinii enzyme but only marginal selectivity for the T. gondii enzyme. Greater than fivefold selectivity for P. carinii but not T. gondii dihydrofolate reductase was also observed for the 2, 4 -diaminoquinazolines with 5 -methyl, 5 -fluoro, 5 - and 6 -bromo, 6 -chloro, and 5 -chloro- 6 -bromo substitution. In contrast, alkyl and aralkyl substitution at the 6 - and 7 -positions of 2, 4 -diaminopteridines was found to be a favorable feature for selective inhibition of the T. gondii enzyme and, in two cases, for both enzymes. Nine of the fifty-one compounds tested against P. carinii dihydrofolate reductase and four of the thirty compounds tested against T. gondii dihydrofolate reductase displayed fivefold or greater selectivity for the microbial enzyme versus the rat liver enzyme. The most selective against both enzymes was 2, 4 -diamino- 6, 7 -bis(cyclohexylmethyl) pteridine, with a selectivity ratio 2 orders of magnitude greater than the value reported for trimetrexate and piritrexim. Since substitution at the 7 -position is generally considered to be detrimental to the binding of 2, 4 -diaminop-teridines and related compounds to mammalian dihydrofolate reductase, the selectivity observed in this study with the 6, 7 -bis(cyclohexylmethyl) analog may represent a useful approach to enhancing selective inhibition of the enzyme from nonmammalian species...|$|R
