2500|$|Emily: [...] "The {{stakes were}} {{definitely}} higher on that song. We {{knew it was}} special {{because it was so}} autobiographical, and we had to get it right. We've all gone through so many emotions about the incident. We talked for days with Dan before putting pen to paper, and he really helped get inside our heads and put these feelings out. <b>And</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> had this song done, it freed us up to do the rest of the album without that burden." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 16, 2006, the Dixie Chicks {{released}} the single [...] "Not Ready to Make Nice" [...] {{in advance of}} their upcoming album. [...] Written by the Dixie Chicks and songwriter Dan Wilson, it directly addressed the political controversy that had surrounded the group for the previous three years. Robison said, [...] "The stakes were definitely higher on that song. We knew it was special {{because it was so}} autobiographical, and we had to get it right. <b>And</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> had that song done, it freed us up to do the rest of the album without that burden." [...] She said writing the song had become their [...] "therapy", since they had to hold in so many stored emotions for so long. Thus, the band considered the album not so much political as very personal.|$|E
2500|$|Souter {{went over}} the {{qualifications}} for standing set by previous precedents, and concluded {{that they were all}} met in this case, [...] "there is no dispute that taxpayer money in identifiable amounts is funding conferences, and these are alleged to have the purpose of promoting religion. Cf. Doremus v. Board of Ed. of Hawthorne, 342 U. S. 429, 434 (1952) [...] The taxpayers therefore seek not to 'extend' Flast ...but merely to apply it. When executive agencies spend identifiable sums of tax money for religious purposes, no less than when Congress authorizes the same thing, taxpayers suffer injury. <b>And</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> recognize the injury as sufficient for Article III, there can be no serious question about the other elements of the standing enquiry: the injury is indisputably 'traceable' to the spending, and 'likely to be redressed by' an injunction prohibiting it. Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751 (1984)". He also noted that [...] "There will not always be competitors for the funds who would make better plaintiffs (and indeed {{there appears to be no}} such competitor here), so after accepting the importance of the injury there is no reason to refuse standing as a prudential matter." ...|$|E

60|$|On week days, {{we did not}} fare {{quite so}} well as on Sundays; <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> came to dinner, and found two {{enormous}} bullock hearts smoking {{at each end of}} the Highlanders' table. Jackson was indignant at the outrage.|$|E

6000|$|... "Just imagine such {{a monster}} {{anywhere}} in this country, <b>and</b> at <b>once</b> <b>we</b> {{could get a}} sort of idea of the 'worms,' which possibly did frequent the great morasses which spread round the mouths {{of many of the}} great European rivers." ...|$|R
60|$|Presently the Selenite turned about, flickered {{into the}} shadow, {{stood for a}} moment {{retrospective}} at the door, and then closed it on us; <b>and</b> <b>once</b> more <b>we</b> were in that murmurous mystery of darkness into which we had awakened.|$|R
6000|$|Maccario laughed. “What is mine is my friend’s, {{and there}} is a poor house at your service. One could reach it in a week’s march, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> there <b>we</b> are short of nothing. This is, you understand, a {{grateful}} country.” ...|$|R
60|$|Stopping only {{sufficiently}} long {{to secure}} the rifles which were near at hand, we four ran to the cabin, the door of which my mother held open; <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> were inside, the dear soul clasped me to her bosom as if I had {{come back from the}} dead, as indeed was very nearly the case.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why--uh--it {{is from a}} girl. I {{started to}} tell you about her one day. She's an artist, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> took a long tramp in the country.

60|$|No {{time was}} lost in getting under way for the short voyage to Hog island. It {{seemed to me that}} Hiram Griffin {{believed}} every moment precious, for he urged the crew of the sloop to their utmost, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> were on our course, he questioned the helmsman if he was steering in as nearly a straight line as might be possible.|$|E
60|$|With {{a rueful}} smile, I {{directed}} that our original course be resumed, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> again <b>we</b> set off toward merry England. That {{was three months}} ago, and we haven't arrived yet; {{nor is there any}} likelihood that we ever shall.|$|R
6000|$|Why, hang it, {{it occurs}} to me that by the time we reach New York you Twichells will be invading Europe <b>and</b> <b>once</b> more <b>we</b> shall miss the connection. This is {{thoroughly}} exasperating. Aren't we ever going to meet again? ...|$|R

60|$|Contrary to our expectations, {{we found}} little {{indication}} that lions in any great numbers laired {{in this part}} of ancient London. Well-worn pathways, molded by padded paws, led through the cavernous windows or doorways of a few of the ruins we passed, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> saw the savage face of a great, black-maned lion scowling down upon us from a shattered stone balcony.|$|E

[...] "If that snow-ridge lies where I think it does, there's a ravine running down through {{the neck of the}} high spur; <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> strike the big dip it's a straight trail to the cache.

60|$|We had supper, {{and that}} night {{was one of the}} prettiest nights I ever see. The moon made it just like daylight, only a heap softer; <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> see a lion {{standing}} all alone by himself, just all alone on the earth, it seemed like, and his shadder laid on the sand by him like a puddle of ink. That's the kind of moonlight to have.|$|E

60|$|Once we made twenty-five {{miles in}} a day, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> made forty miles (through the Great American Desert), and ten miles beyond--fifty in all --in twenty-three hours, without halting to eat, drink or rest.

60|$|We {{must have}} gone a mile before we came in sight of him.
