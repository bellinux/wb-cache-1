40|$|We {{assessed}} if {{the relative}} importance of biotic and abiotic factors for plant community composition differs along environmental gradients and between functional groups, and asked which implications this may have in a warmer and wetter future. The study location is a unique grid of sites spanning regional-scale temperature and precipitation gradients in <b>boreal</b> <b>and</b> <b>alpine</b> <b>grasslands</b> in southern Norway. Within each site we sampled vegetation and associated biotic and abiotic factors, and combined broad- and fine-scale ordination analyses to assess the relative explanatory power of these factors for species composition. Although the community responses to biotic and abiotic factors did not consistently change as predicted along the bioclimatic gradients, abiotic variables tended to explain a larger proportion of the variation in species composition towards colder sites, whereas biotic variables explained more towards warmer sites, supporting the stress gradient hypothesis. Significant interactions with precipitation suggest that biotic variables explained more towards wetter climates in the sub <b>alpine</b> <b>and</b> <b>boreal</b> sites, but more towards drier climates in the colder alpine. Thus, we predict that biotic interactions may become more important in <b>alpine</b> <b>and</b> <b>boreal</b> <b>grasslands</b> in a warmer future, although more winter precipitation may counteract this trend in oceanic alpine climates. Our results show that both local and regional scales analyses are needed to disentangle the local vegetation-environment relationships and their regional- scale drivers, and biotic interactions and precipitation must be included when predicting future species assemblages. </p...|$|R
40|$|Amino acids play a {{critical}} role in soil-N cycling. Much of the current research on amino acid cycling has been conducted in arctic, <b>alpine,</b> <b>boreal,</b> <b>and</b> temperate <b>grassland</b> ecosystems. There are no comparable data for temperate forests. We quantified the concentration and production of amino acid N and inorganic N in three forests varying in parent material and tree species composition in Connecticut, USA. Soil samples were collected on three sample dates in 2001 and 2002. At all three sites, a pool of free amino acids was present in soil on all sample dates. Among-site differences in the production of amino acids were related to variations in the activity of proteolytic enzymes, the sensitivity of proteolytic enzymes to the availability of protein substrate, and the presence or absence of a surface organic horizon. Among-site differences in amino acid turnover appeared to be at least partially related to soil C-to-N ratios and their effect on C vs. N limitation to microbial function. Amino acid concentrations in the top 15 cm of mineral soil in these study sites fell within the range of reported values for ecosystems spanning a wide latitudinal gradient, including ecosystems in which amino acids are thought to contribute substantively to plant-N nutrition. The concentration of amino acid N in the organic horizons of these study sites was considerably higher than those reported in the literature. The implications of the results for N capture by temperate forest trees are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Heathland {{habitats}} in Ireland occur {{primarily in}} an oceanic setting which is {{strongly influenced by}} changes in the climate. As {{a consequence of the}} oceanic environment, Ireland has a high proportion of the northern Atlantic wet <b>and</b> <b>alpine</b> <b>and</b> <b>boreal</b> heaths of high conservation value within Europe. Future climate change is widely expected to place additional pressure on these systems. Seven bioclimatic envelope modelling techniques implemented in the BIOMOD modelling framework were used to model Wet <b>and</b> <b>Alpine</b> <b>and</b> <b>Boreal</b> heath distributions in Ireland. The 1961 to 1990 baseline models closely matched the observed distribution, and emphasise the strong dependency on climate. Mean winter precipitation, mean winter temperature and elevation were found to be important model components. The fitted models discrimination ability was assessed using the area under the curve (range 0. 874 to 0. 929, Wet heath; 0. 858 to 0. 936, <b>Alpine</b> <b>and</b> <b>Boreal</b> heath) of a receiver operating characteristic plot; the true skill statistic (range 0. 648 to 0. 713, Wet heath; 0. 666 to 0. 737, <b>Alpine</b> <b>and</b> <b>Boreal</b> heath); <b>and</b> Cohen’s kappa (range 0. 652 to 0. 714, Wet heath; 0. 641 to 0. 738, <b>Alpine</b> <b>and</b> <b>Boreal</b> heath). A BIOMOD ensemble prediction from all the models was used to project changes based on a climate change scenario for 2031 to 2060 dynamically downscaled from the Hadley Centre HadCM 3 -Q 16 global climate model. The climate change projections for the individual models change markedly from the consistent baseline predictions. Projected climate space losses (gains) from the BIOMOD consensus model are - 40. 84 % (limited expansion) and - 10. 38 % (full expansion) for Wet heath; and - 18. 31 % (limited expansion) and + 28. 17 % (full expansion) for <b>Alpine</b> <b>and</b> <b>Boreal</b> heath.

40|$|Background {{and aims}} Soils derived from serpentinite (serpentine soils) often have low {{macronutrient}} con-centrations, exceedingly low Ca:Mg molar ratios and high heavy metal concentrations, typically resulting in sparse vegetative cover. This combined suite of edaphic stresses {{is referred to}} as the “serpentine syndrome. ” Although several plant community-level studies have been conducted to identify the most important edaphic factor limiting plant growth on serpentine, the primary factor identified has often varied by plant community and local climate. Few studies to date have been conducted in serpentine plant communities of alpine or boreal climates. The goal of our study was to determine the primary limiting edaphic factors on plant community species composition and productivity (cover) in the <b>alpine</b> <b>and</b> <b>boreal</b> climate of the Western Alps, Italy. Methods Soil properties and vegetation composition were analyzed for several sites underlain by serpentinite, gabbro, and calc-schist substrates and correlated using direct and indirect statistical methods. Results Boreal forest soils were well-developed and tended to have low pH throughout the soil profile resulting in high Ni availability. Alpine soils, in comparison, were less developed. The distinct ser-pentine plant communities of the Western Alps are most strongly correlated with high levels of bioavail-able Ni associated with low soil pH.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} for biogeographers and conservation planners {{is to identify}} where to best locate or distribute high-priority areas for conservation and to explore whether these areas are well represented by conservation actions such as protected areas (PAs). We aimed to identify high-priority areas for conservation, expressed as hotpots of rarity-weighted richness (HRR) -sites that efficiently represent species-for birds across EU countries, and to explore whether HRR are well represented by the Natura 2000 network. Natura 2000 is an evolving network of PAs that seeks to conserve biodiversity through {{the persistence of the}} most patrimonial species and habitats across Europe. This network includes Sites of Community Importance (SCI) and Special Areas of Conservation (SAC), where the latter regulated the designation of Special Protected Areas (SPA). Distribution maps for 416 bird species and complementarity-based approaches were used to map geographical patterns of rarity-weighted richness (RWR) and HRR for birds. We used species accumulation index to evaluate whether RWR was efficient surrogates to identify HRRs for birds. The results of our analysis support the proposition that prioritizing sites in order of RWR is a reliable way to identify sites that efficiently represent birds. HRRs were concentrated in the Mediterranean Basin <b>and</b> <b>alpine</b> <b>and</b> <b>boreal</b> biogeographical regions of northern Europe. The cells with high RWR values did not correspond to cells where Natura 2000 was present. We suggest that patterns of RWR could become a focus for conservation biogeography.

40|$|Abstract Background: Reindeer and caribou (both {{belonging}} to the species Rangifer tarandus L.) {{are among the most}} important large herbivores in Eurasia’s and North America’s arctic, <b>alpine</b> <b>and</b> <b>boreal</b> zones. In Sweden, the impact of reindeer grazing on arctic <b>and</b> <b>alpine</b> vegetation has recently been re-evaluated. In the 1990 s, records of grazing-related vegetation degradation helped to form a widespread perception that some mountain areas were overgrazed. However, later analyses have shown no evidence of large-scale overutilisation of reindeer ranges in the Swedish mountains. The present-day consensus is that overgrazing has been temporary and local, and that it rarely has caused permanent damage, but it is imperative to examine the scientific support for these views. Moreover, the Swedish Parliament has adopted an environmental quality objective according to which it is essential to preserve ‘a mountain landscape characterised by grazing’. No details have been given on how this goal is to be interpreted, which is another reason why the significance of reindeer grazing for arctic/alpine vegetation needs to be assessed. This protocol presents the methodology that will be used in a systematic review of the impact of reindeer herbivory in arctic <b>and</b> <b>alpine</b> ecosystems. The focus will be on Fennoscandia, but data {{from other parts of the}} range of R. tarandus will be used when deemed appropriate. Methods: The review will be based on primary field studies that compare vegetation subject to different degrees of reindeer/caribou herbivory (including grazing and browsing as well as trampling). Such comparisons can be either temporal, spatial or both. The review will cover impacts of herbivory in arctic, subarctic, <b>alpine</b> <b>and</b> subalpine areas (including the forest-tundra ecotone) across the range of R. tarandus, but not in boreal forests. Relevant aspects of vegetation include cover (abundance), biomass, diversity (e. g. species richness), structure, composition (including functional groups) and productivity.

As decomposer microbes may differ in their ability/strategy to efficiently use soil organic carbon (SOC) within different phases of the year, understanding seasonal microbial process will increase our knowledge of biogeochemical cycling from the aspect of decomposition rates and corresponding nutrient dynamics. In this study, we measured soil microbial biomass, community composition and potential SOC mineralization rates in winter and summer, from six temperate ecosystems in northern China. Our results showed a clear pattern of increased microbial biomass C to nitrogen (N) ratio in most winter soils. Concurrently, a shift in soil microbial community composition occurred with higher fungal to bacterial biomass ratio and gram negative (G-) to gram positive (G+) bacterial biomass ratio in winter than in summer.

40|$|Altitudinal {{gradients}} offer attractive {{opportunities for}} studies of population differentiation {{in response to}} environmental heterogeneity. In this thesis, I examined population differentiation along altitudinal gradients by combining common-garden experiments with field studies <b>and</b> experiments in <b>alpine,</b> subalpine <b>and</b> <b>boreal</b> populations of the perennial herb Solidago virgaurea. More specifically, I determined whether leaf physiology in terms of nitrogen concentration and resorption, flowering phenology, flower production and reproductive effort vary along altitudinal gradients. Nitrogen concentration in green leaves were higher in alpine than in subalpine <b>and</b> <b>boreal</b> populations. These differences persisted when plants were grown from seeds in a common-garden experiment at two sites, suggesting that the differences have a genetic component. There was mixed support for a trade-off between maximized carbon gain through the maintenance of high nitrogen concentration, and minimized nitrogen loss through high resorption. In their natural habitats alpine populations began flowering later than subalpine populations, but this difference was reversed when plants were grown in a common environment. This suggests that genetic differences among populations counteract environmental effects and reduce phenotypic variation in flowering time among populations. Flowering time thus shows countergradient genetic variation in S. virgaurea. In a common-garden experiment, boreal populations produced more flowers and had a higher reproductive effort than subalpine <b>and</b> <b>alpine</b> populations indicating habitat-specific genetic differences in reproductive allocation. In a field study, which included three populations, seed set was close to zero in the alpine population, intermediate in the subalpine population, and high in the boreal population.

40|$|We present here {{a simple}} and novel {{proposal}} for the modulation and rhythm of ice-ages and interglacials during the late Pleistocene. While the standard Milankovitch-precession theory fails to explain the long intervals between interglacials, these can {{be accounted for by}} a novel forcing and feedback system involving CO 2, dust and albedo. During the glacial period, the high albedo of the northern ice sheets drives down global temperatures and CO 2 concentrations, despite subsequent precessional forcing maxima. Over the following millennia more CO 2 is sequestered in the oceans and atmospheric concentrations eventually reach a critical minima of about 200  ppm, which combined with arid conditions, causes a die-back of temperate <b>and</b> <b>boreal</b> forests <b>and</b> <b>grasslands,</b> especially at high altitude. The ensuing soil erosion generates dust storms, resulting in increased dust deposition and lower albedo on the northern ice sheets. As northern hemisphere insolation increases during the next Milankovitch cycle, the dust-laden ice-sheets absorb considerably more insolation and undergo rapid melting, which forces the climate into an interglacial period. The proposed mechanism is simple, robust, and comprehensive in its scope, and its key elements are well supported by empirical evidence...|$|R
40|$|Snow {{cover is}} not only a major {{hydrological}} input to the Wolf Creek Research Basin but provides a habitat for life and sustains important interactions with vegetation and climate. The losses or gains of snow within the basin and to and from the basin are therefore extremely important for the hydrology, biology and climatology of the region. This paper will review a four year record of snow studies in Wolf Creek. The sites are in the <b>alpine,</b> shrub-tundra <b>and</b> <b>boreal</b> forest vegetation bands of the basin and are representative of tundra plateaux, valley shrub-tundra and lowland forest respectively. At the <b>alpine</b> <b>and</b> shrub-tundra sites, wind speed, blowing snow occurrence, snow depth, temperature and humidity were measured half-hourly and snowfall and snow accumulation on the ground measured monthly. These measurements permit a mass balance of snow transformations due to blowing snow on the <b>alpine</b> plateaux <b>and</b> shrub-tundra valleys of Wolf Creek Basin. The measurements show that on average 50 % of snowfall is removed from the <b>alpine</b> plateau <b>and</b> 25 % is removed from low-lying shrub-tundra by blowing snow storms. Much of this snow is relocated to hillsides where it can triple snow accumulations. However, though some blowing snow is lost to sublimation, the proportion cannot yet be quantified in mountainous terrain. At the forest site, snow surveys under the canopy were compared to snowfall records in order to estimate snow interception storage and eventual sublimation. Snow remains in the canopy for weeks to months in the cold mid-winter. From 38 %- 45 % of annual snowfall is lost to snow sublimation from spruce canopies in the lower elevations of Wolf Creek. The implications of these results are that the snow cover of Wolf Creek is controlled by its vegetation cover, exposure and climate. Changes to land use or climate in the Yukon will therefore have profound changes on the snow cover and then on the water resources, aquatic chemistry, animal populations and vegetation that are influenced by snow...|$|R

This lack of a common understanding hampers both the management of wild and semi-domesticated reindeer populations and the preservation of biodiversity. To achieve a common platform, we have undertaken a systematic review of published studies that compare vegetation at sites with different reindeer densities. Besides biodiversity, we focused on effects on major plant growth forms. Methods: Searches for literature were made using online publication databases, search engines, specialist websites and bibliographies of literature reviews. Search terms were developed in English, Finnish, Norwegian, Russian and Swedish. Identified articles were screened for relevance based on titles, abstracts and full text using inclusion criteria set out in an a priori protocol. Relevant articles were then subject to critical appraisal of susceptibility to bias. Data on outcomes such as abundance, biomass, cover and species richness of vegetation were extracted together with metadata on site properties and other potential effect modifiers. Results: Our searches identified more than 6, 000 articles. After screening for relevance, 100 of them remained. Critical appraisal excluded 60 articles, leaving 40 articles with 41 independent studies. Almost two thirds of these studies had been conducted in Fennoscandia. Meta-analysis could be made of data from 31 of the studies. Overall, effects of reindeer on species richness of vascular plants depended on temperature, ranging from negative at low temperature to positive at high temperature. Effects on forbs, graminoids, woody species, and bryophytes were weak or non-significant, whereas the effect on lichens was negative. However, many individual studies showed clear positive or negative effects, but the available information was insufficient to explain this context dependence. Conclusions: We see two pressing matters emerging from our study. First, {{there is a lack}} of research with which to build a circumpolar understanding of grazing effects, which calls for more studies using a common protocol to quantify reindeer impacts.

Methods:Searches for literature were made using online publication databases, search engines, specialist websites and bibliographies of literature reviews. Search terms were developed in English, Finnish, Norwegian, Russian and Swedish. Identified articles were screened for relevance based on titles, abstracts and full text using inclusion criteria set out in ana prioriprotocol. Relevant articles were then subject to critical appraisal of susceptibility to bias. Data on outcomes such as abundance, biomass, cover and species richness of vegetation were extracted together with metadata on site properties and other potential effect modifiers. Results:Our searches identified more than 6, 000 articles. After screening for relevance, 100 of them remained. Critical appraisal excluded 60 articles, leaving 40 articles with 41 independent studies. Almost two thirds of these studies had been conducted in Fennoscandia. Meta-analysis could be made of data from 31 of the studies. Overall, effects of reindeer on species richness of vascular plants depended on temperature, ranging from negative at low temperature to positive at high temperature. Effects on forbs, graminoids, woody species, and bryophytes were weak or non-significant, whereas the effect on lichens was negative. However, many individual studies showed clear positive or negative effects, but the available information was insufficient to explain this context dependence. Conclusions:We see two pressing matters emerging from our study. First, {{there is a lack}} of research with which to build a circumpolar understanding of grazing effects, which calls for more studies using a common protocol to quantify reindeer impacts. Secondly, the highly context-dependent outcomes suggest that research and management have to consider local conditions. For instance, predictions of what a management decision would mean for the effects of reindeer on vegetation will have to take the variation of vegetation types and dominant growth forms, productivity, and grazing history into account. Policy and management have to go hand-in-hand with research in individual cases if the dynamics between plants, animals, and humans are to be sufficiently understood.

40|$|AbstractUnderstanding {{changes in}} plant-soil C, N and P using data alone is {{difficult}} {{due to the}} linkages between carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles (C, N and P), and multiple changing long-term drivers (e. g. climate, land-use, and atmospheric N deposition). Hence, dynamic models are a vital tool for disentangling these drivers, helping us understand the dominant processes and drivers and predict future change. However, {{it is essential that}} models are tested against data if their outputs are to be concluded upon with confidence. Here, a simulation of C, N and P cycles using the N 14 CP model was compared with time-series observations of C, N and P in soils and biomass from the Rothamsted Research long-term experiments spanning 150 years, providing an unprecedented temporal integrated test of such a model. N 14 CP reproduced broad trends in soil organic matter (SOM) C, N and P, vegetation biomass and N and P leaching. Subsequently, the model was used to decouple the effects of land management and elevated nitrogen deposition in these experiments. Elevated N deposition over the last 150 years is shown to have increased net primary productivity (NPP) 4. 5 -fold and total carbon sequestration 5 -fold at the Geescroft Wilderness experiment, which was re-wilded to woodland in 1886. In contrast, the model predicts that for cropped grassland conditions at the Park Grass site, elevated N deposition has very little effect on SOM, as increases in NPP are diverted from the soil. More broadly, these results suggest that N deposition is likely to have had a large effect on SOM and NPP in northern temperate <b>and</b> <b>boreal</b> semi-natural <b>grasslands</b> <b>and</b> forests. However, in cropped and grazed systems in the same region, whilst NPP may have been supported in part by elevated N deposition, declines in SOM may not have been appreciably counteracted by increased N availability...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} inter- and intraspecific phylogenetic {{relationships in}} the ectomycorrhizal fungal genus Leccinum section Scabra. Species of this section are exclusively associated with Betula and occur throughout the Northern Hemisphere. We compared the phylogenetic relationships of arctic, <b>alpine,</b> <b>boreal</b> <b>and</b> temperate accessions of section Scabra based on DNA sequences of the single-copy nuclear gene Gapdh and the multiple-copy nuclear region 5. 8 S-ITS 2. Exclusively arctic lineages were not detected in species that occur both in arctic-alpine or boreal regions, except in L. rotundifoliae that was restricted to cold climates. L. scabrum and L. holopus showed an intercontinental phylogeographic pattern, and L. variicolor showed a pattern unrelated to geographical distribution. Molecular clock estimates indicated that L. rotundifoliae {{is as old as}} other species in section Scabra. Individual gene trees suggest that interspecific hybridisation occurred several times in the evolution of section Scabra...|$|R
40|$|ABSTR ACT: The horn fly, Haematobia irritans irritans (L.), is an ectoparasitic blood feeder {{mainly on}} cattle. Its {{cosmopolitan}} distribution extends from <b>boreal</b> <b>and</b> <b>grassland</b> regions in {{northern and southern}} latitudes to the tropics. Stress and blood loss from horn flies can reduce cattle weight gain and milk production. Horn flies show substantial plasticity in their response to winter. Populations in warmer, lower latitudes {{have been reported to}} overwinter in a state of dormancy, but most overwinter as active adults in normal or reduced numbers. As latitudes increase, winters are generally colder, and correspond-ingly, larger percentages of horn fly populations become dormant as pharate adults (a post-pupal, pre-emergent stage) or die. Reports on the effect of elevation on horn fly dormancy at high elevations were contradictory. When it occurs, dormancy takes place beneath cattle dung pats and in the underlying soil. The horn fly’s mode of dormancy is commonly called diapause, but the collective research on horn fly diapause (behavioral and biochemical) is not conclusive. Understanding the horn fly’s overwintering behaviors can lead to development of pre-dormancy insecticide spray strategies in colder latitudes while other strategies must be determined for warmer regions...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{simulate}} potential impacts {{of climate change}} on forests, two succession models were applied to sites in the Northeast German lowlands. The models, which had been developed for <b>Alpine</b> (FORECE) <b>and</b> <b>Boreal</b> (FORSKA) forests differ {{from each other in}} the way they represent tree growth processes and the impact of environmental factors on establishment and growth. Both models were adjusted and compared with each other at sites that are situated along an ecological gradient from maritime to subcontinental climate. These sites are extending the former environmental space of model application towards water limited conditions, which under a predicted climatic change may have increasing importance for European forests. First results showed that FORECE was unrealistically sensitive to changes in soil moisture. On the other hand, FORSKA generally simulated very low biomasses. Since the structure of FORSKA seemed to be better suited for the simulation of changing environmental conditions, this model was chosen for further model development, applications and sensitivity analyses. Among other changes, establishment rates were increased and some environmental response factors were analysed. The function of account for resource depletion was modified. After the modifications for Central European conditions were made, there was a decrease in performance for the Boreal site. Both simulated total biomasses and species composition had changed. We conclude, that with currently available models, realistic forest dynamics within different climatic zones of Europe cannot be simulated without more substantial model modifications. (orig.)

40|$|It is {{essential}} that scientists be able to predict how strong climate warming, including profound changes to winter climate, will affect the ecosystem services of <b>alpine,</b> arctic <b>and</b> <b>boreal</b> areas, <b>and</b> how these services are driven by vegetation-soil feedbacks. One fruitful avenue for studying such changing feedbacks is through plant functional traits, as an understanding of these traits may help us to understand and synthesise (1) responses of vegetation (through 'response traits' and 'specific response functions' of each species) to winter climate and (2) the effects of changing vegetation composition (through 'effect traits' and 'specific effect functions' of each species) on soil functions. It is the relative correspondence of variation in response and effect traits that will provide useful data on the impacts of winter climate change on carbon and nutrient cycling processes. Here we discuss several examples of how the trait-based, response-effect framework can help scientists {{to better understand the}} effects of winter warming on key ecosystem functions in cold biomes. These examples support the view that measuring species for their response and effect traits, and how these traits are linked across species through correspondence of variation in specific response and effects functions, may be a useful approach for teasing out the contribution of changing vegetation composition to winter warming effects on ecosystem functions. This approach will be particularly useful when linked with ecosystem-level measurements of vegetation and process responses to winter warming along natural gradients, over medium time scales in given sites or in response to experimental climate manipulations. © 2013 The Ecological Society of Japan...|$|R
40|$|As {{length and}} timing of the growing season are major factors {{explaining}} differences in carbon exchange of ecosystems, we analyzed seasonal patterns of net ecosystem carbon exchange (FNEE) using eddy covariance data of the FLUXNET data base ([URL] The study included <b>boreal</b> <b>and</b> temperate, deciduous and coniferous forests, Mediterranean evergreen systems, rainforest, native and managed temperate grasslands, tundra, and C 3 and C 4 crops. Generalization of seasonal patterns are useful for identifying functional vegetation types for global dynamic vegetation models, {{as well as for}} global inversion studies, and can help improve phenological modules in SVAT or biogeochemical models. The results of this study have important validation potential for global carbon cycle modeling. The phasing of respiratory and assimilatory capacity differed within forest types: for temperate coniferous forests seasonal uptake and release capacities are in phase, for temperate deciduous <b>and</b> <b>boreal</b> coniferous forests, releasewas delayed compared to uptake. According to seasonal pattern of maximum nighttime release (evaluated over 15 -day periods, Fmax) the study sites can be grouped in four classes: (1) <b>boreal</b> <b>and</b> high altitude conifers and grasslands; (2) temperate deciduous and temperate conifers; (3) tundra and crops; (4) evergreen Mediterranean and tropical forests. Similar results are found for maximum daytime uptake (Fmin) and the integral net carbon flux, but temperate deciduous forests fall into class 1. For forests, seasonal amplitudes of Fmax and Fmin increased in the order tropical 3 ̆c Mediterranean and temperate coniferous 3 ̆c temperate deciduous <b>and</b> <b>boreal</b> forests, <b>and</b> the pattern seems relatively stable for these groups. The seasonal amplitudes of Fmax and Fmin are largest for managed grasslands and crops.

Due to data restrictions, our analysis centered mainly on Northern Hemisphere temperate <b>and</b> <b>boreal</b> forest ecosystems. <b>Grasslands,</b> crops, Mediterranean ecosystems, and rainforests are under-represented, as are savanna systems, wooded grassland, shrubland, or year-round measurements in tundra systems.
