The objective is to study the pulmonary <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures</b> and the pulmonary histopathological changes in patients having congenital heart defects with left-to-right shunt. A total of 20 consecutive patients having congenital heart defects with left-to- right shunt who underwent surgical correction were studied. Intra-operative mean pulmonary <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures</b> were measured before and after surgical correction. Lung biopsy was taken to study the histopathological changes of lung parenchyma and vasculature. All patients, irrespective of age at the time of surgical repair and the type and size of the cardiac defect had raised mean pulmonary <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures</b> that were decreased significantly immediately after surgical correction. Pulmonary parenchymal changes and vascular changes were noted in 18 and 9 patients respectively.

Overall, the brain exerts less control over breathing; electrical stimulation of respiration-linked brain areas does not influence the lungs, as it does during non-REM sleep and in waking.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the sympathetic nervous system on the cerebral circulatory response to graded reductions in mean <b>arterial</b> blood <b>pressure</b> was studied in anesthetized baboons.

In normal baboons, the constancy of cerebral blood flow was maintained until mean <b>arterial</b> blood <b>pressure</b> was approximately 65 % of the base-line value; thereafter, cerebral blood flow decreased when <b>arterial</b> blood <b>pressure</b> was reduced. Superior cervical sympathectomy of 2 - 3 weeks duration did not affect the normal response.

25|$|The {{distribution}} of {{blood flow to}} the tissues is variable and subject to a variety of influences. When the flow is locally high, that area is dominated by perfusion, and by diffusion when the flow is low. The {{distribution of}} flow is controlled by the mean <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> and the local vascular resistance, and the <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> depends on cardiac output and the total vascular resistance. Basic vascular resistance is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, and metabolites, temperature, and local and systemic hormones have secondary and often localised effects, which can vary considerably with circumstances. Peripheral vasoconstriction in cold water decreases overall heat loss without increasing oxygen consumption until shivering begins, at which point oxygen consumption will rise, though the vasoconstriction can persist.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> drops {{significantly}} when {{a patient}} stands up from sitting.

40|$|Rapid and drastic {{fluctuations}} in <b>arterial</b> blood <b>pressures,</b> {{such as those}} occurring during heavy resistance exercise pose a unique challenge {{to the maintenance of}} cerebral perfusion. During high-intensity leg cycling, regulation of cerebral perfusion is reduced by rapid decreases in beat-to-beat {{fluctuations in}} blood pressure (diastolic phase) rather than rapid increases (systolic phase). The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that rhythmic heavy resistance exercise will similarly impair the regulation of cerebral blood flow during the diastolic phase of beat-to-beat fluctuations in pressure. We studied seven healthy male subjects. Beat-to-beat finger <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures,</b> and middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv) were measured during 10 repetitions (REP) of rhythmic high intensity leg press exercise. Velocities and <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures</b> were evaluated during both the isotonic concentric and eccentric phases of each REP. The Gosling pulsatility index (PI) of MCAv of each REP was calculated as MCAv systolic-MCAv diastolic/MCAv mean. During the concentric phase, systolic <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures</b> progressively increased from REP 1 through REP 10 (P 3 ̆c 0. 001), while systolic MCAv was not different across all REPs (P 3 ̆e 0. 2). Diastolic <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures</b> during the eccentric phase also increased from REP 1 through REP 10 (P = 0. 03) however diastolic MCAv decreased during REPs 7 - 10 compared with REP 2 (P ≤ 0. 02). MCAv PI also increased during REP 7 - 10 compared to REP 2 (P ≤ 0. 02). Similar to high-intensity leg cycling, our data suggest that during rhythmic high-intensity leg press exercise, cerebral perfusion is well controlled during periods of rapid increases in blood pressure, but regulation of cerebral perfusion is impaired during the diastolic phase of beat-to-beat fluctuations in pressure...|$|R
40|$|The F 508 del {{mutation}} of the {{cystic fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) {{is the most}} common cause of cystic fibrosis (CF). Both CF patients and F 508 del carriers have decreased blood pressure. While this has been attributed to salt depletion, recent studies have shown F 508 del expression interferes with smooth muscle cell calcium mobilization. We tested the hypothesis that carriers of the F 508 del mutation have lower adult blood pressures and reduced aortic contractility without a reduction in circulating blood volume. By radiotelemetry, F 508 del heterozygous mice had significantly lower <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures</b> than wild-type C 57 BL/ 6 controls, with the greatest effect seen at the time of dark-to-light cycle transition (mean difference of 10 mmHg). To replicate the vascular effects of sympathetic arousal, isoproterenol and epinephrine were co-infused, and F 508 del mice again had significantly reduced <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures.</b> Aortas isolated from F 508 del heterozygous mice had significantly decreased constriction to noradrenaline (0. 9 ± 0. 2 versus 2. 9 ± 0. 7 mN). Inhibition of wild-type CFTR or the inositol triphosphate receptor replicated the phenotype of F 508 del aortas. CFTR carrier status did not alter circulating blood volume. We conclude the CFTR-F 508 del mutation decreases aortic contractility and lowers <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures.</b> As a cAMP-activated chloride channel that facilitates calcium mobilization, we speculate wild-type CFTR co-activation during adrenergic receptor stimulation buffers the vasodilatory response to catecholamines, and loss of this compensatory vasoconstrictor tone may contribute to the lower <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures</b> seen in heterozygote carriers of a CFTR-F 508 del mutation...|$|R

To withstand and adapt to the pressures within, arteries are surrounded by varying thicknesses of smooth muscle which have extensive elastic and inelastic connective tissues.
