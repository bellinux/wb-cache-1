The NiO–MCMB composite anode is studied in a full lithium-ion battery using a high-voltage LiNi 0. 5 Mn 1. 5 O 4 electrode that is considered a suitable cathode in combination with conversion-type electrodes.

30|$|In {{the case}} of 2 D materials, the weak bonds between their {{constituent}} sheets and the ease of intercalation of alkali ions between their layers {{are two of the}} foremost properties which make them desirable as energy storage materials [98]. The bulk counterparts of these layered materials suffer from significant volume changes upon interacting with alkali metal ions in addition to low <b>average</b> <b>working</b> <b>voltages.</b> However, when these materials are exfoliated, they are able to accommodate a greater number of intercalating ions due to their weak out-of-plane binding [99]. Also, exfoliation increases the active surface area for electrochemical activity, reduces the tortuosity, and provides easier intercalation pathways. Among the various layered TMDs that are available, MoS 2 are among the most studied [100]. Manipulation of the surface properties has been shown to enhance the electrochemical behavior, as has been demonstrated by Yang et al. [101]. The vertically aligned MoS 2 nanosheets they synthesized exhibited a higher capacity, which is attributable to their dangling bonds which provided a greater active surface area for the ions traveling through the electrolyte [101]. Chowalla and coworkers have also demonstrated the ability of MoS 2 as a promising supercapacitor electrode (specific capacitance values ranging from 400 to 700  F cm− 3) [102]. The authors have attributed the superior performance to hydrophilicity, good electrical conductivity, and ability of the 1 T MoS 2 to expand to host the intercalating ions [102]. Also, it has been demonstrated that some of the 2 D TMDs, e.g., MoS 2 and WS 2, undergo conversion reactions, especially when interacting with Na+ ions [103].|$|R

The solutions, designed for sodium battery applications, are thermally characterized by TGA and studied {{in terms of}} transport properties by combining pulse field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG NMR) and electrochemical techniques. Both electrolytes reveal suitable characteristics for sodium batteries, such as ion conductivity of about 10 − 3  S cm− 1, sodium transport number of 0. 5, a stable stripping-deposition trend, and electrochemical stability windows extending from 0 to 4  V. However, the more volatile DME leads to a higher ion association degree. The suitability of both electrolytes is then verified in sodium-sulfur cells by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic test. The measurements confirm the reversibility of the sodium-sulfur process, and reveal the expected trend of the sulfur electrode in sodium cell with <b>average</b> <b>working</b> <b>voltage</b> of about 1. 8  V, with a higher polarization and lower capacity for the cell using the DME-based electrolyte.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a carbon-coated, {{nano-sized}} TiO 2 anode for application in lithium-ion batteries. The lithiation-delithiation process characteristic of this mixed anatase/rutile material has been investigated in detail, in order to define the optimal operating voltage range and to further enhance the electrode cycle life. Ex-situ x-ray diffraction measurements demonstrate that the rutile phase becomes electrochemically inactive toward lithium intercalation after the first cycle and remains inactive by cycles. The TiO 2 electrochemical behavior is studied by means of various techniques, including galvanostatic cycling and potentiodynamic cycling with galvanostatic acceleration. We show that the combination of the TiO 2 anode with a high-voltage, LiNi 0. 5 Mn 1. 5 O 4 spinel cathode results in an advanced li-ion battery able to exchange reversibly a capacity higher than 100 mAh/g for over 70 cycles at the high rate of 1 C. Considering an <b>average</b> <b>working</b> <b>voltage</b> of about 2. 9 V, the theoretical energy content of the cell here disclosed is about 300 Wh kg- 1. Taking into account the energy content and high safety level of the full cell, due to the use of a TiO 2 -based electrode, by operating at a voltage value well far from the one associated to the common electrolyte decomposition, i. e. about 1. 7 V, we may propose the anode here studied as suitable material for advanced energy storage systems...|$|E

X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveal the well-defined layered-structure of the cathode {{and the presence of}} nanometric antimony trapped within the carbon matrix of the anode. The optimized materials structures allow enhanced performance of each electrode in cells with sodium metal anodes, as revealed by electrochemical characterization including cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic cycling (GC), further improved by the addition of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) into the electrolyte. Finally, the performance of the rechargeable Sb–C/Na 0. 6 Ni 0. 22 Fe 0. 11 Mn 0. 66 O 2 sodium-ion battery using the FEC-added electrolyte solution is reported.

The excellent lithium storage property of the MnO material and its high performance as anode in the MnO/LiNi 0. 5 Mn 1. 5 O 4 -delta lithium ion battery is mainly attributed to its hierarchical micro/nanostructure, which could buffer the volume change and shorten the diffusion length of Li+ during the charge/discharge processes...|$|R
40|$|Fluorophosphates are {{considered}} among the most interesting series of cathode materials for Li/Na-ion batteries. Na 2 FePO 4 F, with layered structure and two-dimensional pathways for facile Na+/Li+ transport [1], exhibits minimal structural changes (3. 7 %) upon reduction/oxidation. The <b>average</b> <b>working</b> <b>voltage</b> is 3. 3 V versus Li+/Li. However, {{one of the key}} drawbacks of Na 2 FePO 4 F electrodes is their low intrinsic electronic conductivity. In this work, we report on the synthesis of Na 2 FePO 4 F by spray-drying, a technique which is easily scaled-up from the lab- to the industrial-scale and ensures a good homogeneity of all precursors. We are investigating the replacement of the grinding step by the addition of conductive carbon (carbon black and carbon nanotubes) to the solution containing the inorganic precursors of the Na 2 FePO 4 F phase in order to prepare Na 2 FePO 4 F/CB and Na 2 FePO 4 F/CNT with different ratios of CB and CNT (10 and 20 %) and enhanced conductivity. The electrochemical performance shows that the addition of CNT improves remarkably the capacity of the NFPF electrode material thanks to better CNT dispersion inside and at the surface of the NFPF particles which enhances the electronic conductivity.

The crystal and local structure were analyzed by XRD and Mössbauer spectroscopy. The electrochemical properties were studied by galvanostatic cycling in lithium cells. The electrochemical performance is markedly better in the case of Na 2 FePO 4 F/CNT (20 wt%), with specific capacities of about 100 mAh/g (Na 2 FePO 4 F/CNT) at C/ 4 rate 2 vs. 50 mAh/g for Na 2 FePO 4 F/CB. The characterization of Na 2 FePO 4 F/CB particles by electron microscopy revealed a carbon-poor surface and a good carbon dispersion for Na 2 FePO 4 F/CNT particles attributed to better diffusion of carbon nanotubes in the droplets during drying.
