5000|$|A Tarot Nouveau deck {{consists}} of 56 cards of four suits and 22 emblematic cards called <b>atouts</b> (trumps). Each suit {{consists of}} fourteen cards: ten pip cards, and four face cards: the Roi (King), Dame (Queen), Cavalier (Knight), and Valet (Jack). Of the <b>atouts,</b> 21 are numbered from 1 to 21, and a non-numbered card called [...] "Fou" [...] ("Fool", also called [...] "Mat" [...] or [...] "L'Excuse" [...] in play) which [...] "excuses" [...] the player from following suit. Of the <b>atouts,</b> only the Fool and trumps 1 and 21 {{are considered to}} be [...] "counting" [...] cards because they are worth more than 1 point. Winning the last trick awards bonuses only if it is won with the lowest trump.|$|E

50|$|The tarot deck {{contains}} a fifth suit, known in gaming as the <b>atouts</b> or honours and in occult circles as the Major Arcana, {{which serves as}} a permanent trump suit in games played with the tarot deck. The suit consists of twenty-two cards, including a Fool {{which serves as a}} highest trump (in Central Europe) or excuses the players from following suit elsewhere.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>atouts</b> or trumps depict genre {{scenes of}} {{whimsical}} early 19th-century social {{activities of the}} well-to-do European bourgeoisie, hence a common alternate name for this deck, the [...] "Bourgeois Tarot". This {{is in contrast to}} the trionfi of Italian Tarocco decks and the Major Arcana of [...] "esoteric" [...] decks used for cartomancy, which have allegorical illustrations and, in cartomancy, interpretive meaning.|$|E
50|$|There {{is also a}} suit of twenty-two <b>atouts</b> (trump cards). The Fool, {{which is}} {{unnumbered}} in the Tarot de Marseille, is viewed as separate and additional to the other twenty-one numbered trumps because it usually cannot win a trick. Occultists (and many tarotists nowadays) call these twenty-two cards Les Lames Majeures de Figures (The Major Figure Cards) or Arcanes Majeures (major arcana) in French.|$|E

5000|$|The suit of {{the first}} {{revealed}} card becomes the [...] "atout" [...] suit (in case of a joker, the receiving player may choose a suit or declare no-trump.) A clean biriba is formed with this suit is worth 600 points rather than 200; a dirty <b>atout</b> biriba is halved to 300 points. This presents a focus both for aggressive and defensive play; <b>atout</b> cards (especially the middle cards, 7 through 10,) are rarely voluntarily discarded, and all <b>atout</b> cards are guarded if an opponent is suspected of collecting them or nearing completion of a biriba. The rare hiliara biriba is still 1000 points (no extra points).|$|R
5000|$|Historically, {{this game}} was played with the Italian suited Tarot of Marseilles deck which lacked {{reversible}} face cards and trumps and corner indices. In modern times, for ease of play, a deck style known as the [...] "Tarot Nouveau" [...] or [...] "Bourgeois Tarot" [...] is used to play the game. This deck, which began to appear around the late 19th century, uses French suits and replaces the traditional Renaissance allegorical images of the <b>atouts</b> with depictions of typical fin de siècle genre scenes of French life and leisure.|$|E
5000|$|Many of {{the images}} of the Rider-Waite-Colman Smith (RWS or WCS) deck are derived from the [...] "Tarot de Marseille". However, the {{influence}} of other decks is also apparent in the RWCS deck, e.g., the 17th century Jacques Viéville deck for the Sun card and the 16th century Sola Busca tarot deck for certain pip cards, notably the 3 of Swords and 7 of Swords. The 19th century deck of Swiss-French occultist Oswald Wirth was also influential for certain of the iconographic features of the <b>Atouts</b> or major arcana cards of the RWCS deck.|$|E
50|$|The Rook deck {{consists}} of 57 cards: a blue Rook Bird card, {{similar to a}} joker, and 56 cards divided into four suits or colors. Each suit—black, red, yellow, and green—is made up of cards numbered 1 through 14. This 14-card, four-suit system {{is derived from the}} French tarot deck; removing the 21 <b>atouts,</b> or trumps, from that deck while keeping a 57-card French-suited deck that was re-faced to create the Rook deck. Though the culture-neutral deck was developed for the game Rook, many other games have evolved or existed previously that use the 56-card deck with or without the Rook, or — by removing the 14s and the Rook — one can use the deck like a deck of standard playing cards. The cards 2-3-4 are not in the game.|$|E

5000|$|The Tarot Nouveau deck, {{like most}} (but not all) tarot decks, is {{composed}} of 78 cards. 56 are suited in the traditional French suits, with 14 cards per suit; ten [...] "pip" [...] cards with values 1-10 (the Ace bears the number 1 instead of the familiar [...] "A", and usually ranks low), and four court cards: Jack (Valet), Knight (Chevalier or Cavalier), Queen (Dame) and King (Roi). The other 22 are the 21 <b>atouts</b> or trumps and one Fool. The deck is thus primarily different from the 52-card Poker deck {{in the existence of}} the separate trump [...] "suit", and the addition of the Knight court card. With these cards removed the deck is identical to the 52-card deck for playing purposes. The face cards do not use the Parisian pattern (portrait officiel) but have their own unique illustrations. The Fool, though similar in appearance and function to the Joker card of poker decks, has differing origins (see Joker for more information).|$|E
40|$|Pierre-Noël Denieuil, The Scientist and the Manager in the Firm Sociological {{research}} on French {{businesses in the}} 1980 s indicates that the field of anthropology is representing a variety of approaches : cultural regulation by informal knowledge; sociability abd the dynamics of belonging; situation of the business in a social and regional context; industrial symbolism and the expropriation of training and knowledge by machines; social stratification and daily life; {{the construction of the}} enterprise as a culture and as a source of social identifications. Beyond the diversity of approaches, there is a difference of perspective between the reflections of the socio-anthropological investigator and the manager.

The random y-radiolysis of the polymer provides a constant source of macro-alkyl radicals that are likely to initiate a selective oxidation of the polymer through free-radicals reactions involving the abstraction of labile hydrogen <b>atouts.</b> In the present paper, infrared spectroscopy bas been used to study the y-degradation of EPDM cross-linked with dicumyl peroxide and/or stabilised with two types of anti-oxidants (hindered phenol or amine-type). The results show that the anti-oxidants are not efficient in preventing oxidation. To understand the lack of efficiency of the stabilisers, the impacts of the various formulations on the rate of degradation of EPDM against chain oxidation involved in thermal and UV ageing were also studied...|$|E
