5|$|In early 11th century, the Persian scholar Al Biruni visited India, {{lived with}} Hindus for 16 years, {{and with their}} help {{translated}} several significant Sanskrit works into <b>Arabic</b> <b>and</b> Persian languages. One of these was Patanjali's Yogasutras. Al Biruni's translation preserved many of the core themes of Patañjali 's Yoga philosophy, but certain sutras and analytical commentaries were restated making it more consistent with Islamic monotheistic theology. Al Biruni's version of Yoga Sutras reached Persia and Arabian peninsula by about 1050 AD. Later, in the 16th century, the hath yoga text Amritakunda was translated into <b>Arabic</b> <b>and</b> then Persian. Yoga was, however, not accepted by mainstream Sunni and Shia Islam. Minority Islamic sects such as the mystic Sufi movement, particularly in South Asia, adopted Indian yoga practises, including postures and breath control. Muhammad Ghawth, a Shattari Sufi {{and one of the}} translators of yoga text in 16th century, drew controversy for his interest in yoga and was persecuted for his Sufi beliefs.|$|E
