50|$|The Bonapartist laws of {{succession}} {{were far from}} traditional. The family members ignored primogeniture (by excluding Lucien Bonaparte and his descendants); they <b>annulled</b> <b>marriages</b> to achieve their goals; {{and they did not}} submit to the Pope's rights as final arbiter on the validity of marriages. The very claim of the Bonaparte family to rule France was far from traditional.|$|R

50|$|Thus, {{even if the}} {{underlying}} marriage is held to be void there may still be rights and obligations that continue and are recognized by court order. An example may be an <b>annulled</b> <b>marriage</b> where the court awards alimony to the weaker, poorer or less well educated spouse to allow them {{a period of time}} {{to go back to school}} or re-enter the work force.|$|E
50|$|Annulment {{is a legal}} {{procedure}} for declaring a marriage null and void. Unlike divorce, it is usually retroactive, meaning that an <b>annulled</b> <b>marriage</b> {{is considered to be}} invalid from the beginning almost as if it had never taken place (though some jurisdictions provide that the marriage is only void from the date of the annulment; for example, this is the case in section 12 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 in England and Wales).In legal terminology, an annulment makes a void marriage or a voidable marriage null.|$|E

50|$|Born in Calgary, Alberta, {{and raised}} {{on a farm in}} Erickson, near Creston, British Columbia, his {{childhood}} was somewhat isolated. After working as a farm hand, a bank clerk, and a park ranger, Birney went on to college to study chemical engineering but graduated with a degree in English. He studied at the University of British Columbia, University of Toronto, University of California, Berkeley and University of London.During his year in Toronto he became a Marxist-Leninist. Through a brief and quickly <b>annulled</b> <b>marriage</b> to Sylvia Johnston, he was introduced to Trotskyism. In the 1930s he was an active Trotskyist in Canada and Britain and was the leading figure in the Socialist Workers League but disagreed with the Trotskyist position on World War II and left the movement.|$|E
5000|$|Kamal's {{affair with}} co-star Simran Bagga (22 {{years younger than}} him) {{triggered}} the breakup. His relationship with Simran (who appeared in Pammal K. Sambandam and Panchathantiram) was brief, since Simran married her childhood friend in late 2003. Kamal had lived with former actress Gautami Tadimalla (who had starred with him in several films during the late 1980s and early 1990s) from 2005 till 2016. Gautami had announced on her blog that she had ended her relationship with him. Gautami wrote on her blog: [...] "It is heartbreaking {{for me to have}} to say today that I and Mr. Haasan are no longer together. After almost 13 years together, it {{has been one of the}} most devastating decisions that I have ever had to make in my life,". Shruti, Akshara and Gautami's daughter Subbalakshmi (from an <b>annulled</b> <b>marriage)</b> lived with them.|$|E
50|$|The {{status of}} a wife may be {{terminated}} by divorce, annulment, or {{the death of a}} spouse. In the case of divorce, terminology such as former-wife or ex-wife is often used. With regard to annulment, such terms are not, strictly speaking, correct, because annulment, unlike divorce, is usually retroactive, meaning that an <b>annulled</b> <b>marriage</b> is considered to be invalid from the beginning almost as if it had never taken place. In the case of the death of the other spouse, the term used is widow. The social status of such women varies by culture, but in some places, they may be subject to potentially harmful practices, such as widow inheritance or levirate marriage; or divorced women may be socially stigmatized. In some cultures, the termination of the status of wife made life itself meaningless, {{as in the case of}} those cultures that practiced sati, a funeral ritual within some Asian communities, in which a recently widowed woman committed suicide by fire, typically on the husband's funeral pyre.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} modern papers and {{conferences}} {{have continued to}} discuss both issues and possible solutions, including {{the possibility of a}} modern takkanah, religious legislative enaction, to empower the Chief Rabbinate of Israel to intervene to <b>annul</b> <b>marriages</b> retroactively, {{in a way that was}} possible for some time during the Middle Ages. Such proposals are considered too radicalâ€”and not legally permissible (in terms of halakha) -- by most orthodox leaders.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>marriage</b> can be <b>annulled</b> {{if there}} is a defect in the {{essential}} requisites.

2500|$|The Court did {{rule that}} their {{decision}} cannot {{be applied to}} retroactively <b>annul</b> <b>marriages</b> that were transacted while the practice was legal in the state of California. [...] Proposition 8 has no retroactive effect. The California Supreme Court ruled unanimously on May 26, 2009, that the approximately 18,000 same-sex marriages that had occurred prior to Proposition 8's passage would still be valid and must continue to be recognized in the state, since the amendment does not state explicitly that it would nullify the same-sex marriages performed before it took effect.|$|R

60|$|Then there was, besides these, a third party, who {{maintained}} that King Henry the Eighth's will was not effectual in legalizing again the <b>annulled</b> <b>marriages,</b> {{but that it}} was sufficient to set aside the claims of Margaret. Of course, with them, Lady Jane Grey, who, as will be seen by the table, was the representative of the second sister of Henry VIII., was the only heir. The Earl of Northumberland embraced this view. His motive was to raise Lady Jane Grey to the throne, in order to exclude the Princess Mary, whose accession he knew very well would bring all his greatness to a very sudden end.|$|R
