Student representative bodies <b>also</b> <b>exist</b> {{at the various}} colleges, academic faculties and departments.|$|E

5|$|Quantities {{of atoms}} {{are found in}} {{different}} states of matter that depend on the physical conditions, such as temperature and pressure. By varying the conditions, materials can transition between solids, liquids, gases and plasmas. Within a state, a material can <b>also</b> <b>exist</b> in different allotropes. An {{example of this is}} solid carbon, which can exist as graphite or diamond. Gaseous allotropes exist as well, such as dioxygen and ozone.|$|E
5|$|Systems <b>also</b> <b>exist</b> to {{classify}} TBI by its pathological features. Lesions can be extra-axial, (occurring within the skull but {{outside of the}} brain) or intra-axial (occurring within the brain tissue). Damage from TBI can be focal or diffuse, confined to specific areas or distributed in a more general manner, respectively. However, {{it is common for}} both types of injury to exist in a given case.|$|E
