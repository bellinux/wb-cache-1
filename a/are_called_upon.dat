Buddhist monks <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> to perform pirit to ward off the floating spirits.

25|$|Often retirees <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> to {{care for}} grandchildren and {{occasionally}} aged parents. For many it gives them more time to devote to a hobby or sport such as golf or sailing. On the other hand, many retirees feel restless and suffer from depression {{as a result of}} their new situation. Although it is not scientifically possible to directly show that retirement either causes or contributes to depression, the newly retired are one of the most vulnerable societal groups when it comes to depression most likely due to confluence of increasing age and deteriorating health status. Retirement coincides with deterioration of one's health that correlates with increasing age and this likely plays a major role in increased rates of depression in retirees. Longitudinal and cross-sectional studies have shown that healthy elderly and retired people are as happy or happier and have an equal quality of life as they age as compared to younger employed adults, therefore retirement in and of itself is not likely to contribute to development of depression.|$|E

500|$|In the 12th century, {{more than}} a century after Norway was [...] "officially" [...] Christianized, Thor was still being invoked by the population, as {{evidenced}} by a stick bearing a runic message found among the Bryggen inscriptions in Bergen, Norway. On the stick, both Thor and Odin <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> for help; Thor is asked to [...] "receive" [...] the reader, and Odin to [...] "own" [...] them. Also around the 12th century, iconography of the Christianizing 11th-century king Olaf II of Norway (Saint Olaf) absorbed elements of the native Thor; Olaf II had become a familiarly red-bearded, hammer-wielding figure.|$|E
500|$|Each god descends {{from his}} or her own genealogy, pursues differing interests, has a certain area of expertise, and is governed by a unique personality; however, these {{descriptions}} arise from a multiplicity of archaic local variants, which do not always agree with one another. When these gods <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> in poetry, prayer or cult, they are referred to by a combination of their name and epithets, that identify them by these distinctions from other manifestations of themselves (e.g., Apollo Musagetes is [...] "Apollo, [...] leader of the Muses"). Alternatively the epithet may identify a particular and localized aspect of the god, sometimes thought to be already ancient during the classical epoch of Greece.|$|E

[...] Forensic anthropologists can provide physical characteristics of the person to input into missing person databases such as that of the National Crime Information Center in the US or INTERPOL's yellow notice database.|$|E

500|$|In January, caucuses {{were held}} in local districts to pick delegates. The state {{conventions}} would then select {{a number of these}} delegates to represent the state at the national convention. Prior to the convention, {{there was a great deal}} of machine politics conducted by the candidates. John Sherman utilized Treasury Department employees who owed their jobs to him to meet up at local caucuses across the South to guarantee loyal state delegations. State-level bosses, like Roscoe Conkling, used the state conventions to pick delegates that were politically allied to a particular candidate. In the state delegate-selection convention at Utica, New York, Grant's supporters carried only a 217–180 majority over Blaine supporters, but Conkling passed a resolution declaring that, [...] "the Republicans of New York believe the re-election of Ulysses S. Grant as Presidential candidate of urgent importance, and the delegates this day assembled <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> and instructed to use their earnest and united efforts to secure his nomination.|$|E

500|$|It {{was during}} this time, {{the heyday of the}} French Revolution, that Barbauld {{published}} her most radical political pieces. From 1787 to 1790, Charles James Fox attempted to convince the House of Commons to pass a law granting Dissenters full citizenship rights. When this bill was defeated for the third time, Barbauld wrote one of her most passionate pamphlets, An Address to the Opposers of the Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts. Readers were shocked to discover that such a well-reasoned argument should come from a woman. In 1791, after William Wilberforce's attempt to outlaw the slave trade failed, Barbauld published her Epistle to William Wilberforce Esq. On the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade, which not only lamented the fate of the slaves, but also warned of the cultural and social degeneration the British could expect if they did not abandon slavery. In 1792, she continued this theme of national responsibility in an anti-war sermon entitled Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation which argued that each individual is responsible for the actions of the nation: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> to repent of national sins, because we can help them, and because we ought to help them." ...|$|E
