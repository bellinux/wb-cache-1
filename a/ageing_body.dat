60|$|He {{produced}} four candle-butts {{from the}} side-pockets of his soutane {{and placed them}} deftly among the coals and twisted papers. Stephen watched him in silence. Kneeling thus on the flagstone to kindle the fire and busied with the disposition of his wisps of paper and candle-butts he seemed more than ever a humble server making ready the place of sacrifice in an empty temple, a levite of the Lord. Like a levite's robe of plain linen the faded worn soutane draped the kneeling figure of one whom the canonicals or the bell-bordered ephod would irk and trouble. His very body had waxed old in lowly service of the Lord--in tending the fire upon the altar, in bearing tidings secretly, in waiting upon worldlings, in striking swiftly when bidden--and yet had remained ungraced by aught of saintly or of prelatic beauty. Nay, his very soul had waxed old in that service without growing towards light and beauty or spreading abroad a sweet odour of her sanctity--a mortified will no more responsive to the thrill of its obedience than was to the thrill of love or combat his <b>ageing</b> <b>body,</b> spare and sinewy, greyed with a silver-pointed down.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveCurrently, {{there are}} no data on the caliber and length of the urethra in Taiwanese adult females. The {{aim of this study}} was to {{determine}} the caliber and length of the urethra, and to evaluate their correlations with <b>age,</b> <b>body</b> height, body weight and body mass index (BMI) in asymptomatic Taiwanese adult females. Materials and MethodsTwenty-three women with a mean age of 63. 2 years (range, 41 - 82 years) were studied. All study subjects claimed to have no difficulty in voiding. Measurements were taken just prior to the scheduled cystoscopy under local anesthesia. We used a bougie à boule to measure the caliber of the urethra, and used a scaled cystoscope sheath to determine the length of the urethra. Correlations of urethral length and caliber with <b>age,</b> <b>body</b> height, body weight and BMI were analyzed using Spearman correlation. ResultsThe mean <b>age,</b> <b>body</b> height and weight were 63. 2 ± 12. 4 years, 154. 1 ± 8. 3 cm and 54. 3 ± 8. 1 kg, respectively. The mean adult female urethra was 3. 7 ± 0. 7 cm long and 7. 5 ± 0. 6 mm (i. e., 23. 7 ± 1. 9 French) in diameter. There were no statistically significant correlations of urethral length and caliber with <b>age,</b> <b>body</b> height, body weight and BMI (all p > 0. 05). ConclusionThere was no correlation of urethral length and urethral caliber with <b>age,</b> <b>body</b> height, body weight and BMI in asymptomatic adult women. This study provides valuable normal data as the reference for clinical evaluation of voiding dysfunction, and defines urethral stricture and reconstructive surgery of the urethra in females...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives This study explores how {{older women}} with low {{socioeconomic}} status living in rural Tanzania {{give meaning to}} their (<b>aging)</b> <b>body</b> {{in relation to the}} ideals of femininity. Research Design and Methods Ten qualitative in-depth interviews and 10 focus group discussions (N = 60) were conducted among women aged 60 and older. Results The findings reveal that older women perceive their <b>aging</b> <b>body</b> as “a burden. ” This characterization of the body is linked to the inability of the <b>aging</b> <b>body</b> {{to live up to the}} women’s gendered lives. The conflict between their physical limitations and the desire to perform gendered tasks (internalized feminine habitus) affect the women’s process of self-identification. This led to emotional distress and subsequently threatened their survival and well-being.

40|$|Discourses on {{old age and}} ageing are {{framed in}} narrow and binary ways, either as a decline {{narrative}} or through discourses of positive and successful ageing. The decline narrative, on the one hand, is highly centred on {{the decline of the}} <b>ageing</b> <b>body</b> as frail, leaky and unbounded, and on how old age is characterised by non-productivity, increasing passivity and dependency. Discourses on successful ageing, on the other hand, rely heavily on neo-liberal imperatives of activity, autonomy and responsibility. In successful ageing, the specificities of ageing bodies are largely overlooked while the capacity of the old person to retain a youthful body, for example, with the aid of sexuopharmaceuticals, is celebrated. This article argues for the need of a theorising of old age that goes beyond the binaries of decline and success. Drawing on the work of feminist corpomaterialists Rosi Braidotti and Elisabeth Grosz, the article proposes affirmative old age as an alternative conceptualisation of old age. As a theoretical project, affirmative old age aims to acknowledge the material specificities of the <b>ageing</b> <b>body</b> and is an attempt to theorise the <b>ageing</b> <b>body</b> in terms of difference but without understanding it as a body marked by decline, lack or negation...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the <b>ageing</b> <b>body</b> and the ‘body techniques’ practised by older women within their yoga classes. The paper emphasises the importance of exploring alternative definitions of the human condition, how these are shaped and assembled through particular embodied practices which are realised personally and socially. Taking a contextualised phenomenological approach, older women’s experiences are made visible through interview and participant observation. Unlike much sporting practice, the body techniques managed by the women did not emphasise sporting prowess but provided for an integration of body and mind. In the process, biological ageing was accepted yet the women maintained control over the process, troubling prevailing narratives of ageing, declining control and increasing weakness that are taken for granted in much of Western society. The paper highlights the significance of socially rooted ontological embodiment in understanding the <b>ageing</b> <b>body</b> and particular bodily practices...|$|E
40|$|Psychology theorises {{about the}} <b>ageing</b> <b>body</b> {{in terms of}} {{physical}} losses, and recommends transcending the body for satisfactory ageing. This study explored old adults’ conceptions of the <b>ageing</b> <b>body</b> to identify its relevance for their well-being in personal and interpersonal contexts. Ten retired individuals participated in semi-structured interviews and data was analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Ageing was found to trigger a conflict between the participants’ active self and weakening body. The interviewees defensively attempted to sideline their bodies by preoccupying themselves with mental health and interpersonal issues. However, they realised that their daily experiences (e. g., emotions and interpersonal interactions) depended upon bodily fitness and reciprocally, physical health was affected by lifestyle choices alongside socio-cultural influences. This insight about the biopsychosocial nature of the body empowered the participants to adapt to ageing. Their limitations seemed to motivate them to assume health behaviours, to fight for dignity of self and to empathise with significant others, thus enhancing well-being. Perceptions about the body therefore influenced participants’ health management and relationships. An alternative theorisation of the body as an active contributor to human psychosocial identity will pave way for interventions that sustain quality of life among those experiencing physical decline...|$|E

40|$|Research evidencing and advocating active leisure as a {{way towards}} healthy ageing is a {{positive}} strategy for individuals and society. However, without locating this research in the broader socio-cultural contexts of ageing and taking seriously the voices of a diversity of older people, we cannot fully understand what ageing actually means to different people, nor can we hope to create good practices for healthy ageing and flourishing communities. Discourses around ageing are largely {{out of touch with}} the experiences of many of the over- 60 s population. This chapter examines the potential for exploring the perspectives of active older people, to understand how they remain healthy and independent as they age. It draws upon ethnography, auto-ethnography and creative non-fiction to generate insight. It is argued that not only are societies? and individuals? knowledge and understandings of being and becoming old significantly influenced by the power of discourses, contextual locations such as time and place also play a crucial part in this construction. The chapter thus explores the changing relationship of self, body, social and environmental contexts and the implication these have for meaning making, practices and expectations for later lives. Through a nexus of the <b>ageing</b> <b>body,</b> physical activity and nature through the medium of windsurfing, it attempts to 'trouble' stereotypes of ageing, drawing attention to the location and environment in which the activity of windsurfing occurs.

40|$|Taking {{part in a}} {{physical}} or sporting activity incorporates a range of corporeal and emotional sensations that are interwoven with the individual body {{as well as the}} social context in which the experience occurs. In my attempts to explore the contrasting ways in which sport and physical activity are experienced I have incorporated a reflexive lens in order to shape the focus for empirical investigations. Much of this has been influenced by an awareness of the centrality of a body most often read through gender, sexuality and ability. However, with the physical onset of middle-age, the context of the <b>ageing</b> <b>body</b> has increasingly influenced not only my engagement, but also my interpretation of sporting experience, although this has not necessarily diminished the ways that I am able to enjoy participation. In this paper, I explore the processes through which {{a physical}} activity is experienced, in an attempt to qualitatively account for the multitude of individual and external influences that determine whether participation is considered enjoyable, and, ultimately, worth continuing. This paper incorporates the concept of body-reflexive practices, as initially described by Connell (2005), in order to explore the notion of body reflexive pleasures (Wellard 2013) which incorporate an acknowledgment of the physiological, psychological and sociological factors which contribute to a sporting activity being considered pleasurable or not. By adopting an embodied approach to considering men, sport and the <b>ageing</b> <b>body,</b> the intention is to challenge many of the restricted formulations that invariably determine who can or cannot ‘do’ sport and physical activity...|$|E
