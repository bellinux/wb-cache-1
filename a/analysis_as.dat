5|$|In a 1978 {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Clavaria, Ronald Petersen placed C.zollingeri in the subgenus Clavaria, a grouping of species with clamp connections absent from all septa in the fruit body; others in the subgenus included C.purpurea, C.fumosa, and the type, C.vermicularis. A large-scale molecular analysis of the phylogenetic distributions and limits of clavarioid fungi in the family Clavariaceae was published by Bryn Dentiger and David McLaughlin in 2006. Based on their analysis of ribosomal DNA sequences, C.zollingeri shared the greatest genetic similarity with Clavulinopsis laeticolor. Petersen's concept of the infrageneric {{classification of}} Clavaria was largely rejected in this <b>analysis,</b> <b>as</b> {{two of the three}} subgenera he proposed were found to be polyphyletic.|$|E

5|$|Numerous notable riders {{were present}} in the race peloton, though their reasons for {{attending}} varied slightly. Top stage racers like Cadel Evans, Ivan Basso, Robert Gesink, Vincenzo Nibali, Joaquim Rodríguez, Andy Schleck, and Marco Pinotti were present. Evans' attendance was mainly for racing kilometers before attempting to win the Tour de France. Basso, who likewise planned to peak at the Tour de France, came to the race hoping for overall victory. He named Gesink as a potential rival, and Gesink for his part claimed Basso as a rider he fears. Schleck, Nibali, and Evans were named by one pre-race <b>analysis</b> <b>as</b> possible contenders, but not favorites, due to their plans to be at peak form later in the season.|$|E
5|$|Vector {{spaces are}} the subject of linear algebra and are well {{characterized}} by their dimension, which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces arise naturally in mathematical <b>analysis,</b> <b>as</b> function spaces, whose vectors are functions. These vector spaces are generally endowed with additional structure, which may be a topology, allowing the consideration of issues of proximity and continuity. Among these topologies, those that are defined by a norm or inner product are more commonly used, as having a notion of distance between two vectors. This is particularly the case of Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces, which are fundamental in mathematical analysis.|$|E

5|$|Examining the {{symbolism}} in Bosch's art"the freakish riddles … the irresponsible phantasmagoria of an ecstatic"Fränger concluded that his interpretation applied to Bosch's three altarpieces only: The Garden of Earthly Delights, Temptation of Saint Anthony, and The Haywain Triptych. Fränger distinguished these {{pieces from the}} artist's other works and argued that despite their anti-cleric polemic, they were nevertheless all altarpieces, probably commissioned for the devotional purposes of a mystery cult. While commentators accept Fränger's <b>analysis</b> <b>as</b> astute and broad in scope, they have often questioned his final conclusions. These are regarded by many scholars as hypothesis only, and built on an unstable foundation and {{what can only be}} conjecture. Critics argue that artists during this period painted not for their own pleasure but for commission, while the language and secularization of a post-Renaissance mind-set projected onto Bosch would have been alien to the late-Medieval painter.|$|E
5|$|Hemi {{argued that}} a line of Illinois appellate {{opinions}} demonstrated that Illinois law required more than federal law with regard to satisfying due process standards for personal jurisdiction. The Seventh Circuit rejected this argument, finding {{that none of the}} cases cited by Hemi even suggested a meaningful difference between the federal and Illinois due process standards, and {{that at least one of}} the cases cited by Hemi only discussed the distinction in the theoretical context. Though the Seventh Circuit noted that the district court may only exercise jurisdiction only if both federal and state constitutional elements are satisfied, it also stated that it was unaware of cases where personal jurisdiction could be satisfied under the U.S. Constitution, but not under the Illinois Constitution. Hence, the Seventh Circuit limited its <b>analysis</b> <b>as</b> to whether exercising personal jurisdiction over Hemi would comport with the federal guarantee of due process.|$|E
5|$|Lord Wilberforce, in Quistclose, {{stated that}} the {{contract}} gives the moneylender an equitable interest in the loan. Under Wilberforce's two-stage trust, the interest in the money first goes from the lender to the borrower (the primary trust) and then, when the trust's purpose fails, reverses (the secondary trust). In Twinsectra Lord Millett also explained that a Quistclose trust is a resulting trust, but held that the lender retains the interest throughout the transaction, with no need for this interest to reverse if {{the purpose of the}} loan fails. The problem with Wilberforce's <b>analysis,</b> <b>as</b> explained by Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Finance Law at the University of Exeter, is that because the resulting trust only comes into existence after the misuse of the loan, it may come too late; if the money is not available when the claim is brought, there is no remedy. The borrower may already have spent the money, or already be insolvent and the subject of claims by creditors.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} {{locations where}} bog bodies {{have been discovered}} are the Northern European countries of Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and especially Denmark. The oldest of these bodies dates to about 8000 BC, although the majority of specimens in Denmark are from the Pre-Roman Iron Age to Roman Iron Age era (about 500 BC to 400 AD). As of 2006, more than 700ancient {{bodies have been discovered}} in these sites, although other estimates have placed the number in the thousands. It is difficult for scientists to ascertain a precise number because many of the bodies have been lost or destroyed. Before archaeologists began actively searching for bog bodies, the bodies were discovered mostly during the routine extraction of peat, and then reburied or discarded. After the discovery that systematic conservation of Iron Age bodies was attributable to the acidic anaerobic environs, major excavations have occurred in Jutland. Other bog bodies recovered on the Jutland peninsula which have undergone as extensive an <b>analysis</b> <b>as</b> the Haraldskær Woman include Tollund Man, Grauballe Man, Elling Woman, Huldremose Woman and the Borremose Woman.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Three {{formed on}} July 3 in the Caribbean Sea, {{but the next}} day, before being able to strengthen, it moved over the Yucatán Peninsula. The system emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on July 4 at which point a new center of {{circulation}} developed at {{the northern edge of}} the system and the system strengthened to a tropical storm, becoming Tropical Storm Cindy early July 4. The storm moved rapidly across the Gulf and made landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana late July 5 as a minimal hurricane; though it was originally thought to have been only a tropical storm at landfall, it was upgraded to a hurricane in the post-storm <b>analysis.</b> <b>As</b> most storms do, it weakened while over land and became extratropical over the Carolinas on July 7.|$|E
