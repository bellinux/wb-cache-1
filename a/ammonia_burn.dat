40|$|Vision {{systems have}} been in use in the poultry {{industry}} for approximately 9 years in order to automatically assess the quality of slaughtered broilers, and thus: speed up the cut-up and/or packing processes. Quality control takes place {{on the basis of}} colour and shape recognition. The visible defects, which have to be identified, include, amongst others, haemorrhaging, abrasions and fractures. This type of quality control is plant and may therefore vary from plant to plant. On the basis of this selection system, a slaughter line system, which can be incorporated in the Dutch IKB programme, was developed some 5 years ago. The system allows assessment of the slaughtered birds oil the basis of previously established criteria. The visible defects to be identified include, amongst others, litter spots, <b>ammonia</b> <b>burn</b> and haemorrhages. The visible defects occurring are recorded by type and number and expressed per flock as a quality-rating figure by the system...|$|E
50|$|Calcium nitrite can be {{produced}} by different synthesis processes. One is by reacting hydrated lime with NOX gas, which typically comes from a nitric acid plant. At the acid plant, <b>ammonia</b> is <b>burned</b> to produce the NOX gas for acid as well as calcium nitrite.|$|R
50|$|Ammonia gas is toxic {{in large}} {{concentrations}} for prolonged periods {{and can be}} fatal. Since smelling salts produce {{only a small amount}} of ammonia gas, no adverse health problems from their situational use have been reported. However, a high concentration of inhaled <b>ammonia</b> might <b>burn</b> the nasal or oral mucosa.|$|R
2500|$|Ammonia (NH3) {{releases}} H2 in {{an appropriate}} catalytic reformer. Ammonia provides high hydrogen storage densities as a liquid with mild pressurization and cryogenic constraints: It can also be stored as a liquid at room temperature and pressure when mixed with water. Ammonia {{is the second most}} commonly produced chemical in the world and a large infrastructure for making, transporting, and distributing ammonia exists. Ammonia can be reformed to produce hydrogen with no harmful waste, or can mix with existing fuels and under the right conditions burn efficiently. Since there is no carbon in ammonia, no carbon by-products are produced; thereby making this possibility a [...] "carbon neutral" [...] option for the future. Pure <b>ammonia</b> <b>burns</b> poorly at the atmospheric pressures found in natural gas fired water heaters and stoves. Under compression in an automobile engine it is a suitable fuel for slightly modified gasoline engines. Ammonia is a toxic gas at normal temperature and pressure and has a potent odor.|$|R
25|$|Solvent properties: Ammonia is {{miscible}} with water. In an aqueous solution, it can {{be expelled}} by boiling. The aqueous solution of ammonia is basic. The maximum concentration of ammonia in water (a saturated solution) has a density of 0.880 g/cm3 and is often known as '.880 ammonia'. <b>Ammonia</b> does not <b>burn</b> readily or sustain combustion, except under narrow fuel-to-air mixtures of 15–25% air.|$|R
5000|$|Fuming {{has some}} {{inconvenient}} safety issues. The solution of ammonium hydroxide used is much stronger (26% to 30%) than in household ammonia and is corrosive. The fuming {{must be done}} in an enclosed sealed chamber. <b>Ammonia</b> splashes can <b>burn</b> skin and the fumes can cause burns to eyes and lungs. [...] Operators need to wear gas masks, gloves and eye protection.|$|R

500|$|Industrially, ammonia (NH3) is {{the most}} {{important}} compound of nitrogen and is prepared in larger amounts than any other compound, because it contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to food and fertilisers. It is a colourless alkaline gas with a characteristic pungent smell. The presence of hydrogen bonding has very significant effects on ammonia, conferring on it its high melting (−78°C) and boiling (−33°C) points. As a liquid, it is a very good solvent with a high heat of vaporisation (enabling it to be used in vacuum flasks), that also has a low viscosity and electrical conductivity and high dielectric constant, and is less dense than water. However, the hydrogen bonding in NH3 is weaker than that in H2O due to the lower electronegativity of nitrogen compared to oxygen and the presence of only one lone pair in NH3 rather than two in H2O. It is a weak base in aqueous solution (pK'b 4.74); its conjugate acid is ammonium, [...] It can also act as an extremely weak acid, losing a proton to produce the amide anion, [...] It thus undergoes self-dissociation, similar to water, to produce ammonium and amide. <b>Ammonia</b> <b>burns</b> in air or oxygen, though not readily, to produce nitrogen gas; it burns in fluorine with a greenish-yellow flame to give nitrogen trifluoride. Reactions with the other nonmetals are very complex and tend to lead to a mixture of products. Ammonia reacts on heating with metals to give nitrides.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT An {{experiment}} using 4, 800 commercial broiler males (Ross x Ross) {{was conducted}} in 12 climatic chambers. Three levels of relative humidity (RH) (45, 40 to 80, and 75 %) and two levels of internal air circulation (7. 7 to 9. 9 and 17. 8 to 24. 5 cm/s), with each level replicated and, therefore, forming a 3 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments, were imposed as the main effects. Broilers were group weighed and feed efficiencies calculated at 14, 28, and 42 days of age. Percentage dry matter of the litter and a subjective evaluation of general litter conditions (moisture and caking) were scored weekly, with the percentage nitrogen and total quantity of litter produced in each chamber measured {{at the conclusion of}} the study. Ammonia levels were measured in each chamber every second day. A sample of birds (36) from each chamber was processed at 42 days and scored for litter spots and ammonia bums on the breast and for the incidence and severity of twisted legs, crooked toes, and infected and calloused hocks and foot pads. Mean body weight was significantly greater (32 g) at 42 days of age in birds exposed to 45 % RH compared with the two higher regimens of RH. Both the incidence and severity of <b>ammonia</b> <b>burns</b> on the breast and infected foot pads were significantly higher with 75 versus 45 % RH. Increases in RH significantly increased caking and litter moisture and reduced the percentage of dry matter and the percentage of nitrogen found in the litter. Ammonia levels were more variable but generally increased with increases in RH. The two levels of air movement within the chambers produced less influence on the environment than RH, although the scores for both litter moisture and caking were significantly lower with increased levels of internal air circulation. {Key words: broilers, relative humidity, air movement, breast and leg defects, litter conditions...|$|R
25|$|Just like natural gas, the stored ammonia {{can be used}} as {{a thermal}} fuel for {{transportation}} and electricity generation or used in a fuel cell. A standard 60,000 m3 tank of liquid ammonia contains about 211 GWh of energy, equivalent to the annual production of roughly 30 wind turbines. <b>Ammonia</b> can be <b>burned</b> cleanly: water and nitrogen are released, but no CO2 and little or no nitrogen oxides. Ammonia has multiple uses besides being an energy carrier, it is the basis for the production of many chemicals, the most common use is for fertilizer. Given this flexibility of usage, and given that the infrastructure for the safe transport, distribution and usage of ammonia is already in place, it makes ammonia a good candidate to be a large-scale, non-carbon, energy carrier of the future.|$|R

50|$|Ibn 'Isa is {{considered}} one of the most famous physicians of the tenth century. His famous Notebook of the Oculists combined information obtained from both Greco-Roman and Arab sources. The book encompassed information on treatment and classification of over one hundred different eye diseases. In the book, eye diseases were sorted by their anatomical location. The Notebook of the Oculists was widely used by European physicians for hundreds of years. Ibn Isa’s book was one of the first, along with Hunayn ibn Ishaq’s Ten Treatises on the Eye, to illustrate anatomy of the eye. Specifically, Ibn Isa illustrated the optic chiasm and brain. Ibn Isa was the first to describe and suggest treatment for an array of diseases. For example, he was the first to discover the symptoms of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH) - ocular inflammation associated with a distinct whitening of the hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes. Ibn Isa was also the first to classify epiphora as being a result of overzealous cautery of pterygium. In addition to this pioneering description, Ibn Isa also suggested treatments for epiphora based on the stage of the disease - namely treatment in the early stages with astringent materials, for example <b>ammonia</b> salt, <b>burned</b> copper, or lid past and a hook dissection with a feathered quill for chronic stages of epiphora. Ibn Isa is also thought to be the first to describe temporal arteritis, although Sir Jonathan Hutchinson (1828-1913) is erroneously credited with this.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the performance of a}} compression-ignition engine using a dual-fuel approach with ammonia and diesel fuel. With the world 2 ̆ 7 s increasing need for alternative energy and clean emissions, ammonia stands out as a viable candidate since its combustion does not produce the known greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. Ammonia {{is one of the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s most synthesized chemicals and its infrastructure is well established. Ammonia can be regarded as a hydrogen carrier and used as a fuel. However, ammonia is highly resistant to autoignition and readily vaporizes under atmospheric conditions. Therefore, this study introduced ammonia vapor into the engine intake manifold and used the existing diesel injection system to inject diesel fuel or biodiesel to initiate combustion in the cylinder. The test engine was a four-cylinder, turbocharged diesel engine with slight modifications to the intake manifold for ammonia induction. An ammonia fueling system was developed in order to control and measure the amount of ammonia allowed into the engine. Dynamometer tests were performed to measure the engine power, fuel consumption, in-cylinder pressure histories, and exhaust emissions. Engine test results showed that <b>ammonia</b> could be <b>burned</b> in a compression-igntion engine using the present dual-fuel approach. Various combinations of amounts of ammonia and diesel fuel were successfully tested using two major engine operation schemes. One scheme was to use different combinations of ammonia and diesel fuel to achieve a constant peak torque equal to that of 100...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{hydrogen}} as fuel represents a possible solution to reduce {{greenhouse gas emission}} from vehicles. Although proper engine running with hydrogen has been widely demonstrated, hydrogen storage onboard of the vehicle is a major problem. A promising solution is storing hydrogen {{in the form of}} ammonia that is liquid at roughly 9 bar at environmental temperature and therefore involves relatively small volumes and requires light and low-cost tanks. <b>Ammonia</b> can be <b>burned</b> directly in IC engines, however a combustion promoter is necessary to support combustion. As a matter of fact, the best (and carbon-free) promoter is hydrogen, which has very high combustion velocity and wide flammability range, whereas ammonia combustion is characterised by low flame speed and temperature, narrow flammability range and high ignition energy. The experimental activity shown in this paper is focused on analysing the behaviour of a 4 -stroke twin-cylinder SI engine of 505 cm 3 fuelled ammonia-plus-hydrogen. This engine was expressly chosen and modified to be placed in a range extended vehicle where hydrogen is obtained from ammonia by means of on-board catalytic reforming. The experimental results confirm {{that it is necessary to}} add hydrogen to air-ammonia mixture to improve ignition and to increase combustion velocity, with ratios that depend mainly on load and less on engine speed.

A promising solution is storing hydrogen in the form of ammonia that is liquid at roughly 9 bar at environmental temperature and therefore involves relatively small volumes and requires light and low-cost tanks. Moreover, liquid ammonia contains 1. 7 times by volume as much hydrogen as liquid hydrogen itself. It is well known that <b>ammonia</b> can be <b>burned</b> directly in I. C. engines, however a combustion promoter is necessary to support combustion especially in the case of high-speed S. I. engines. As a matter of fact, the best (and carbon-free!) promoter is hydrogen, which has very high combustion velocity and wide flammability range, whereas ammonia combustion is characterised by low flame speed, low flame temperature, narrow flammability range (combustion is impossible if mixture is just slightly lean), high ignition energy and high self-ignition temperature. The experimental activity shown in the paper was aimed at determining proper air-ammonia-hydrogen mixture compositions for the actual operating conditions of a twin-cylinder 505 cm 3 S. I. engine. Hydrogen and ammonia are separately injected in the gaseous phase. The experimental results confirm that it is necessary to add hydrogen to air-ammonia mixture to improve ignition and to speed up combustion, with ratios that depend mainly on load and less on engine speed. This activity is correlated with a larger-scale project, founded by Tuscany Region, in which a partnership of research and industry entities has developed a fully-working plug-in hybrid electric vehicle equipped with a range-extending 15 kW IC engine fuelled with hydrogen and ammonia.

40|$|Storing {{hydrogen}} {{is one of}} the major problems concerning its utilization on board vehicles. Today hydrogen can be compressed and stored at 200 or 350 bar (it is foreseen that in a near future storage pressure will reach 700 bar, according to new expected regulations and using tanks in composite materials) or cryogenically liquefied. An alternative solution is storing hydrogen in the form of ammonia that is liquid at roughly 9 bar at environmental temperature and therefore involves relatively small masses and volumes and requires light and low-cost tanks. Moreover, ammonia contains almost 18 % hydrogen by mass and, by volume, liquid ammonia contains 1. 7 times as much hydrogen as liquid hydrogen. It is well known that <b>ammonia</b> can be <b>burned</b> directly in I. C. engines, however a combustion promoter is necessary to support combustion especially in the case of high-speed S. I. engines. Among the potential promoters, {{hydrogen is}} worthy of note, since it is carbon free and counteracts ammonia combustion characteristics. As a matter of fact, hydrogen has high combustion velocity and wide flammability range, whereas ammonia combustion is characterized by low flame speed, low flame temperature, narrow flammability range, high ignition energy and high self-ignition temperature. The experimental activity shown in this paper is correlated with a project that is focused on a range-extended electric vehicle involving an ammonia-plus-hydrogen I. C. engine and where hydrogen is obtained from ammonia by means of on-board catalytic reforming. Accordingly, the test engine is a 505 cm₃ Lombardini twin-cylinder S. I. engine that is well suited to power the onboard electric generator and the activity is aimed at determining proper air-ammonia-hydrogen mixture compositions at actual operating speeds and loads of the engine connected to the electric generator. Hydrogen and ammonia are separately injected in the gaseous phase. The only mechanical modification of the engine involves the intake manifold, where electro-injectors for hydrogen and for ammonia (conventional ones for CNG application with appropriate modification to inner parts) are added to the original ones for gasoline. The experimental results confirm that it is necessary to add hydrogen to air-ammonia mixture to improve ignition and to increase combustion velocity, with ratios that depend mainly on load and less on engine speed. Brake power is less than with gasoline, due to mixture poor volumetric heating value and to ammonia low flame speed that penalizes engine brake thermal efficiency. The amount of hydrogen needed by the engine is compatible with the flow rate provided by the reformer, except at cold start. The maximum NOx emission is 11. 5 g/kWh at half load and 4500 rpm, without catalytic reduction...|$|R
