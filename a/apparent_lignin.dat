Experimental evidence {{has shown that the}} <b>apparent</b> <b>lignin</b> content of plant tissues depends on the pretreatments employed and on the method and conditions of final isolation of the lignin. By using various pretreatments and carefully regulating the conditions of the final separation of the lignin it has been possible to develop methods which give reproducible results on any given tissue. However, the effect of temperature of preliminary drying on the <b>apparent</b> <b>lignin</b> content of succulent plant tissues has been largely overlooked in these studies. It was thought that in drying fresh plant tissues at elevated temperatures reactions detrimental to the later separation and determination of lignin might occur. With this point in view the studies herein described were undertaken...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem has}} its {{origin in the}} {{empirical}} nature of existing methods for the chemical determination of plant lignin. It is generally recognized that the <b>apparent</b> <b>lignin</b> content of plant tissues depends largely on the pretreatments employed, and on the method and conditions of final isolation of the lignin. By using various pretreatments and carefully regulating {{the conditions of the}} final determination of lignin, methods have been developed which give reproducible results on any given tissue. However, the <b>apparent</b> <b>lignin</b> content of any particular tissue may vary greatly, depending on the method used for its determination. Consequently, an investigation of more efficient methods for the removal of materials which interfere in the final isolation of lignin was indicated. In this connection, special {{attention has been paid to}} obtaining a lignin relatively free from nitrogen, and also, to the prevention of changes in the lignin itself during its isolation. The most commonly used criteria of plant lignin purity have been its nitrogen and methoxyl contents. As an additional criterion of the purity of isolated lignin ultraviolet absorption spectra of lignin solutions have been studied. With the same end in view, high pressure hydrogenation studies have been carried out on pre-extracted materials. These latter studies also throw some light on the chemical composition of lignin from succulent plant tissue as compared with that from mature wood...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the problems presented by lignin to animal production, particularly {{in countries with}} hot climates, where the degree of lignification in plants is extremely variable causing unpredictable reductions in digestibility. The difficulty of chemically defining lignin compounds is reviewed with the conclusion {{that a combination of}} traditional and advanced techniques is required if the biological role of the lignin in the plant is to be explained. Experiments in ruminants have often shown incomplete recovery of compounds traditionally referred to as lignin, leading to the suspicion that a limited digestion of lignin could occur under anaerobic conditions, with fungi playing a predominant role in the process. As is well known, the problem is difficult to study in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. White-rot fungi - Phanerochaete chrysosporium - has become a standard model for in vitro aerobic digestion. The in situ technique appears to be the most suitable for studies under anaerobic conditions, and some results are presented indicating <b>apparent</b> <b>lignin</b> digestibility in forages...|$|E
40|$|The {{degradation}} pathway of vanillyl and veratryl alcohol by Lentinus edodes extracellular enzymes was studied. In {{both cases}} several products of side chain oxidation and aromatic ring cleavage were isolated and characterized. We {{have observed that}} the products from veratryl alcohol degradation by Lentinus edodes are quite different from those isolated from incubations with other white-rot fungi which have veraraldehyde as the major product, in fact, this compound is not produced as final metabolite in L. edodes incubations. This behaviour could explain the <b>apparent</b> absence of <b>lignin</b> peroxidase and veratryl alcohol oxidase activities in L. edodes cultures, since such activities are usually measured by monitoring veratraldehyde formation during the veratryl alcohol oxidation; thus, {{it is suggested that}} additional assay methods should be developed, with preferably direct observation of aromatic ring oxidation products...|$|R
40|$|Lignin samples {{fractionated}} from microwave liquefied switchgrass {{were applied}} {{in the preparation of}} semirigid polyurethane (PU) foams without purification. The objective {{of this study was to}} elucidate the influence of lignin in the PU matrix on the morphological, chemical, mechanical, and thermal properties of the PU foams. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed that lignin with 5 and 10 % content in the PU foams did not influence the cell shape and size. The foam cell size became larger by increasing the lignin content to 15 %. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) indicated that chemical interactions occurred between the lignin hydroxyl and isocyanate revealing that lignin was well dispersed in the matrix materials. The apparent density of the foam with 10 % lignin increased by 14. 2 % compared to the control, while the foam with 15 % lignin had a decreased apparent density. The effect of lignin content on the mechanical properties was similar to that on <b>apparent</b> density. The <b>lignin</b> containing foams were much more thermally stable than the control foam as evidenced by having higher initial decomposition temperature and maximum decomposition rate temperature from the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) profiles...|$|R
40|$|When {{modelling}} {{the carbon}} dynamics of temperate soils, soil organic carbon (SOC) is often represented by three kinetic pools, i. e. fast, slow and passive/inert. Lignin is often {{considered to be}} relatively resistant to decomposition, thus possibly contributing to the passive SOC pool. One way to assess SOC turnover under natural conditions is to follow the fate of 13 C-labelled biomass in soils. We used compound-specific isotope analysis to analyse CuO oxidation products of lignin from grassland topsoils and from an arable topsoil that had received a natural (by C 3 -C 4 vegetation change) or an artificial (by fumigation with labelled CO 2) isotopic label for 9 – 23 years. Results indicate faster <b>apparent</b> turnover for <b>lignin</b> (5 – 26 years in grassland, 9 – 38 years in arable soil) compared with bulk SOC (20 – 26 years in grassland, 51 years in arable soil). Although these calculated lignin turnover times cannot be extrapolated to the whole soil profiles, this paper provides isotopic evidence that lignin in soils is not preferentially preserved, which is a consistent result from both ways of isotopic labelling. It also demonstrates, however, that a considerable proportion of lignin in temperate soils can be stabilized {{for at least a}} few decades...|$|R
40|$|Ranunculus acris subsp. acris L. is a vigorous, {{perennial}} weed, and {{a serious}} problem in dairying regions of New Zealand. Evolved resistance to the phenoxy herbicides (MCPA, MCPB and 2, 4 -D) prompted the search for an alternative method of control, based on the mycoherbicide strategy. Nineteen isolates of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and three isolates of Sclerotinia minor were inoculated onto excised tissues and intact plants of R. acris to evaluate their pathogenicity. All isolates proved pathogenic, with S. sclerotiorum more pathogenic than S. minor, on both excised tissues and intact plants. Seven of the S. sclerotiorum isolates were more pathogenic than the others on excised tissues, but no differences in pathogenicity were found between any of the isolates when inoculated onto intact plants. Many plants were able to recover from buds on the crown, the underground perennating organ of R. acris. The results from the two screening tests did not correlate because the capacity of an isolate to invade the living crown could not be determined using the excised tissue method. This indicated that the excised tissue method {{could not be used}} to predict whole plant mortality, nor therefore the mycoherbicide potential of isolates of S. sclerotiorum for this weed. Aspects of the infection process in intact plants, and in the crown of R. acris, were investigated. The apical and axillary buds on the crown were identified as the specific targets for S. sclerotiorum inoculation since recovery occurred from these sites. The relative importance of crown resistance, and rapid rate of regrowth of R. acris, were ascertained by inoculating plants with and without pre-treatment with chlorsulfuron to suppress regenerative growth. Crown resistance prevented plant mortality, and all plants retained potentially viable axillary buds on remaining crown fragments. Crown resistance was identified as the key factor facilitating plant recovery. An anatomical study of the crown of R. acris was combined with histopathological studies of S. sclerotiorum infection in the crown. Crown tissues varied in their susceptibility to S. Sclerotiorum. Resistance was largely related to morphological features of the crown, these being a thickened, possibly suberised peripheral cortex, <b>apparent</b> deposition of <b>lignin</b> and suberin at the margin of infected tissue, and the resistance of the crown's dense network of vascular tissues. In addition, flowering stems were not rapidly invaded by the pathogen. Together, these non-specific defence mechanisms limited infection within the crown of vegetative and flowering plants, and enabled recovery of the plant from the regenerative buds. Factors influencing the regenerative potential of R. acris were investigated. The biomass and available carbohydrate status of the crown, and the regenerative potential of R. acris were studied at six phenological stages from pre- to post-flowering. There was no obvious period of reserve depletion in the crown during flowering to provide an opportunity for control with S. sclerotiorum. The crown biomass and available carbohydrate status were lowest at preflowering, and increased during the flowering period. Crown available carbohydrate reserves constituted 60 % of crown dry weight at post-flowering. The regenerative potential of R. acris after S. sclerotiorum inoculation was generally lowest at pre-flowering, and greatest at late flowering. The capacity of this weed for vegetative multiplication following S. sclerotiorum inoculation, particularly at late-flowering, was an important factor influencing regenerative potential, and hence plant survival. The effect of repeated defoliation on regenerative potential, crown biomass, crown available carbohydrate, and susceptibility to S. sclerotiorum, was evaluated. Six month old plants of R. acris maintained regrowth during repeated defoliation without depletion of crown biomass nor crown available carbohydrate. This indicated that these plants utilised resources other than carbohydrate reserves to support regrowth. In contrast, the regenerative potential of two year old plants of R. acris declined during repeated defoliation, and the crown biomass, and available carbohydrate reserves were depleted. This provided strong evidence for utilisation of carbohydrate reserves to support regrowth in these plants. Six month old plants which had been repeatedly defoliated were more susceptible to S. sclerotiorum. In all plants, repeated defoliation reduced the recovery response following S. sclerotiorum inoculation. The results of this study have demonstrated how the perennial nature of R. acris limits the efficacy of S. sclerotiorum as a mycoherbicide. An effective control strategy for R. acris may require an integrated approach which combines defoliation followed by inoculation with S. sclerotiorum during the pre-flowering phase, when regenerative potential may be lowest...|$|R
