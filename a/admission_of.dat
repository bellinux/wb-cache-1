5|$|In the 1890s, mixed lodges {{following}} a standard Masonic ritual started {{to appear in}} France, and quickly spread to other countries. Women-only jurisdictions appeared soon afterwards. As a general rule, the <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> women is now recognised in Continental (Grand Orient) jurisdictions. In Anglo-American Freemasonry, neither mixed nor all-female lodges are officially recognised, although unofficial relations can be cordial, with premises sometimes shared.|$|E
5|$|Leaders of {{the main}} rebel coalition, the Syrian National Coalition, were angered by the agreement. The U.S., without {{consulting}} the coalition, had changed its mind about striking Syria.

5|$|The {{issue of}} the radius of the {{electron}} is a challenging problem of the modern theoretical physics. The <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> the hypothesis of a finite radius of the electron is incompatible to the premises {{of the theory of}} relativity. On the other hand, a point-like electron (zero radius) generates serious mathematical difficulties due to the self-energy of the electron tending to infinity.|$|E
5|$|With the <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> British Columbia to Canada on 20 July 1871, Canada {{agreed to}} build a transcontinental {{railroad}}. Construction of the railroad began in 1875, with Kicking Horse Pass chosen, over the more northerly Yellowhead Pass, as the route through the Canadian Rockies. Ten years later, on 7 November 1885, the last spike was driven in Craigellachie, British Columbia.|$|E

5|$|After the Olympics, Evans {{returned}} to Arizona and resumed his studies. In 1985, he represented Australia at the World University Games in Kobe, Japan. The following year, {{he attempted to}} qualify for the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh after only ten days training. He made the qualifying time, but was omitted. Evans later stated that he felt his <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> having only trained for ten days had lowered his standing {{in the eyes of the}} selectors. As a result of being overlooked, Evans retired from competitive swimming.|$|E
5|$|As an {{official}} {{history of the}} Japanese Navy, Sakamoto's work {{was considered to be}} official <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> the attacking submarine's identity. Subsequently, most sources assumed as fact Nakagawa's and I-177s role in the loss of Centaur. Nakagawa refused to speak {{on the subject of the}} attack on Centaur following the war crimes investigation at the end of World War II, even to defend himself or deny the claims made by Rohwer's and Sakamoto's works, and died in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Constitutional {{objections}} {{were raised}} in House debates as to whether both houses of Congress could constitutionally authorize <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> territories, rather than states. Moreover, if the Republic of Texas, a nation in its own right, were admitted as a state, its territorial boundaries, property relations (including slave property), debts and public lands would require a Senate-ratified treaty. Democrats were particularly uneasy about burdening the United States with $10 million in Texas debt, resenting the deluge of speculators, who had bought Texas bonds cheap and now lobbied Congress for the Texas House bill. House Democrats, at an impasse, relinquished the legislative initiative to the southern Whigs.|$|E

Following intense negotiations with the Papacy in Rome and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, Bulgaria converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity, which caused discontent among part of the nobility who directly associated the new religion with the Byzantine Empire and feared that the country would fall under Byzantine influence.|$|E

Swiss troops still served foreign governments until 1860 when they fought in the Siege of Gaeta.

His efforts to further the <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> new western states were stymied by Democrats, who feared that the new states would elect Republicans to Congress.|$|E
5|$|In 1921 Margaret Mackworth, now {{the second}} Viscountess Rhondda, {{launched}} the Six Point Group, an action group that focused {{heavily on the}} equality {{between men and women}} and the rights of the child. Mackworth continued to strive towards equality for women and {{emerged as one of the}} leading feminist campaigners in Britain during the inter-war period. She established a number of women's organisations, pressure groups and launched the influential feminist journal Time and Tide. She also made an unsuccessful bid to gain entry into the House of Lords, fighting against a 1922 ruling that barred the <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> women.|$|E
