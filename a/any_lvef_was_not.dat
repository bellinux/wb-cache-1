40|$|Introduction: Left {{ventricular}} {{ejection fraction}} (<b>LVEF)</b> <b>is</b> {{considered to be}} the single most important prognostic factor in patients with previous myocardial infarction. <b>LVEF</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> improved in all patients after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). This study aimed to assess the possibility of prediction of LVEF changes after CABG using myocardial perfusion gated signle photon emission computed tomography (GSPECT). Materials and Methods: Overall, 48 patients with mean LVEF of 30. 2 % (± 4. 7) underwent Echocardiography and GSPECT after injection of Tc- 99 m-MIBI at rest. Myocardial uptake was evaluated in 17 myocardial segments and was compared with age and gender matched normal data pool. The risks and benefits of CABG were explained to the patients and 16 cases (15 male and 1 female) with the mean age of 61. 1 years (± 10. 8) accepted to undergo off-pump CABG.

Within 4 months post-treatment, ex vivo cardiac output and stroke volume started to decrease and declined continuously throughout the observation period of 16 months. The reduction in stroke volume was already significant (p < 0. 04) at 4 months post-treatment, whereas the decline in cardiac output was significant (p < 0. 05) at 12 months post-treatment.

This study aimed to determine the factors facilitating SCD in patients with silent ischemia after MI. In the Swiss Interventional Study on Silent Ischemia Type II (SWISSI II), 201 patients with silent ischemia after MI were randomized to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or medical management. The main end point of the present analysis was SCD. Multivariable regression models were used to detect potential associations between baseline or follow-up variables and SCD. During a mean follow-up of 10. 3 +/- 2. 6 years, 12 SCDs occurred, corresponding to an average annual event rate of 0. 6 %. On multivariate regression analysis, {{the decline in the}} left ventricular ejection fraction (<b>LVEF)</b> during follow-up <b>was</b> the only independent predictor of SCD (p = 0. 011), other than age; however, the baseline <b>LVEF</b> <b>was</b> <b>not.</b> The decline in <b>LVEF</b> <b>was</b> greater in patients receiving medical management than in those who had received PCI (p < 0. 001), as well as in patients with residual myocardial ischemia or recurrent MI compared with patients without these findings (p = 0. 038 and p < 0. 001, respectively).

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} whether estimation of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) {{by means of}} multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) scanning could reliably stratify cardiac risk prior to elective major vascular surgery. Methods. A review of the English-language literature. Results and Conclusions. Twenty-two studies enrolling a total of 3096 patients were identified from 1984 to date. Selection bias, blinding of the results, different cut-off limits, and several retrospective studies {{were some of the}} problems preventing a comprehensive analysis. The resting <b>LVEF</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> found to <b>be</b> a consistent predictor of perioperative ischaemic cardiac events. In the perioperative phase, poor LV function was, mainly, predictive of congestive heart failure, and, in the long-term, of cardiac outcome. The presence of myocardial wall motion abnormalities was also associated with both a higher chance of postoperative cardiac complications and a worse long-term cardiac outcome. Although measurements of LV function seem to {{play a key role in}} defining a patient's long-term prognosis, the value of routinely measuring <b>LVEF</b> preoperatively <b>is</b> limited and, therefore, MUGA scanning cannot be recommended as a general screening test. Despite this, it has been widely used for cardiac risk assessment in vascular surgery, and only recently its popularity has started declining. Other tests, such as stress-echocardiography and myocardial perfusion imaging, used selectively in moderate-risk patients can refine prediction of cardiac risk. In the future, gated stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, perhaps combined with ANP/BNP plasma level determination, may become a first choice test in preoperative cardiac risk assessment...|$|R

The study cohort comprised 108 patients (78. 6  8 years); 67 (62 %) diagnosed invasively and 41 (38 %) non-invasively. Twenty patients (19 %) were females. An asymmetric hypertrophy pattern was observed in 25 (23 %) patients. Mean <b>LVEF</b> <b>was</b> 52  14 %, with 39 patients (37 %) showing a LVEF< 50 %. Atrial fibrillation (56 %) and a pseudo-infarct pattern (63 %) were the commonest ECG findings. Only 22 patients fulfilled QRS low-voltage criteria while 10 showed LV hypertrophy on ECG.

Methods and results: We studied two cohorts of patients admitted in the cardiology department of a rehabilitation hospital with a diagnosis of chronic HF New York Heart Association class II–IV. The first, in 2006, included 415 patients, 67. 08 ± 10. 59 years; the second, in 2009, included 500 patients, 67. 31 ± 11. 27 years. Considering all patients, the left ventricle ejection fraction (<b>LVEF)</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> statistically different in the two cohorts. Compared to the 2006 cohort, the 2009 female cohort had higher LVEF (60. 49 % ± 13. 41 % vs 64. 42 % ± 13. 79 %, P < 0. 05), while males over 65 years of age had lower LVEF (52. 75 % ± 15. 02 % vs 54. 37 % ± 15. 23 %, P = NS). For females, the probability of having <b>LVEF,</b> 45 % <b>was</b> higher in 2006 (odds ratio = 1. 573). HF with preserved <b>LVEF</b> <b>was</b> more common in females, both in 2006 (78. 2 % vs 54. 2 %) and 2009 (87. 2 % vs 57. 3 %). In the 2009 cohort, <b>LVEF</b> <b>was</b> higher both in young patients (59. 08 % ± 14. 22 % vs 55. 35 % ± 14. 92 %) and patients ≥ than 75 years of age (62. 28 % ± 13. 81 % vs 56. 79 % ± 14. 81 %) compared to the 2006 cohort. Ischemic heart disease was the main underlying cause for HF in both cohorts. Conclusion: HF appeared {{to have the same}} clinical profile over a 3 -year period.

40|$|Background—The {{measurement}} of serum concentrations of cardiac troponin T (TnT) is a simple, useful method to detect myocyte injury {{that may be}} repeated multiple times to follow patients without interobserver variability. Methods and Results—Multiple measurements of TnT with a second-generation assay were performed in 60 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy confirmed by coronary angiography and endomyocardial biopsy between April 1996 and December 1999. Three evolutionary patterns of TnT concentrations were identified. Thirty-three patients had concentrations of TnT, 0. 02 ng/mL throughout the follow-up period (group 1). The remaining 27 patients had high initial serum concentrations of TnT ($ 0. 02 ng/mL). In 10 of these 27 patients, TnT decreased to, 0. 02 ng/mL during follow-up (group 2), whereas 17 had persistently high serum TnT concentrations despite being conventionally treated for chronic congestive heart failure (group 3). Although the initial echocardiographic left ventricular diastolic dimension (LVDd) and left ventricular ejection fraction (<b>LVEF)</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> significantly different among the 3 groups, follow-up echocardiography showed significantly decreased LVDd and increased LVEF in group 1 (each P, 0. 01) and group 2 (each P, 0. 05) compared with increased LVDd and decreased LVEF in group 3 (each P, 0. 05). The cardiac event-free rate was significantly lower in group 3 than in groups 1 and 2 (each P, 0. 001), and the survival rate was lower in group 3 than in group 1 (P, 0. 05).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cardiotoxicity is an {{important}} adverse effect of adjuvant breast cancer treatment with trastuzumab and three monthly left ventricular ejection fraction (<b>LVEF)</b> monitoring <b>is</b> considered mandatory. The {{purpose of this study}} was to gain insight into LVEF monitoring during adjuvant trastuzumab treatment in clinical practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a multicenter retrospective study encompassing 328 patients, of which 171 patients were actually treated with trastuzumab, we analyzed the frequency and mode of LVEF monitoring and compared it with LVEF monitoring guidelines. RESULTS: The results indicated poor guideline adherence. In 9 % of patients trastuzumab was started in spite of a low LVEF (< 55 %). In 24 % of patients no valid baseline <b>LVEF</b> value <b>was</b> available. <b>LVEF</b> measurements during treatment at three, six and 12 months were only performed in, respectively, 53 %, 40 % and 30 % of patients.

40|$|Diabetes is {{a potent}} risk factor for death and heart failure (HF) {{hospitalization}} following myocardial infarction (MI). Whether diabetes modifies the relationship between left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and outcomes in the post-MI population is unknown. The Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction trial (VALIANT) enrolled 14 703 patients with acute MI complicated by HF, systolic dysfunction, or both. We compared the risk of death, HF hospitalization, and/or recurrent MI among patients with and without diabetes using Cox proportional hazards models. To assess the relationship between diabetes, LVEF and outcomes, we assessed the relative influence of baseline LVEF on outcomes in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Totally, 11 325 subjects (3095 diabetics) with site-reported LVEF and known diabetes status were included.

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{examined}} {{the influence of}} medical treatment {{on the results of}} surgery in terms of long-term survival and functional results in patients with chronic, severe aortic regurgitation (AR). BackgroundAsymptomatic patients with AR and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (<b>LVEF)</b> <b>are</b> at high risk because of a higher-than-expected long-term mortality. The influence of preoperative medical therapy on the outcome after aortic valve replacement (AVR) <b>is</b> <b>not</b> well known. MethodsSurgery was indicated for the appearance of a reduced LVEF (< 50 %). At the time of AVR, there were 134 patients treated with nifedipine (group A), and 132 received no medication (group B). ResultsOperative mortality was similar in the two groups (0. 75 % vs. 0. 76 %, p = NS). The LVEF normalized in all of group A, whereas it remained abnormal in 36 group B patients (28 %). At 10 -year follow-up, LVEF persisted higher in group A (62 ± 5 % vs. 48 ± 4 %, p < 0. 001). Five-year survival was similar in the two groups (94 ± 2 % vs. 94 ± 3 %, p = NS). Group A showed a 10 -year survival not different from expected and significantly higher than that in group B (85 ± 4 % vs. 78 ± 5 %, p < 0. 001), which had a worse survival than expected. ConclusionsUnloading treatment with nifedipine in AR allows one to indicate AVR at the appearance of a reduced LVEF with a low operative mortality and an optimal long-term outcome. The concept of surgical correction of AR indicated for reduced <b>LVEF</b> may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> applied to all patients. Indeed, in a large amount of untreated patients, a reduced <b>LVEF</b> preoperatively <b>is</b> <b>not</b> reversed by prompt surgery, indicating irreversible myocardial damage, and 10 -year survival is worse than expected...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Insulin {{resistance}} {{has been}} linked to exercise intolerance in heart failure patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the potential role of coronary flow reserve (CFR), endothelial function and arterial stiffness in explaining this linkage. Methods 39 patients with LVEF[*] 2 peak), digital measurement of endothelial function and arterial stiffness (augmentation index), dual X-ray absorptiometry scan (DEXA) for body composition and insulin sensitivity by a 2 [*]hr hyperinsulinemic (40 [*]mU/min/m 2) isoglycemic clamp. Results Fat free mass adjusted insulin sensitivity was significantly correlated to VO 2 peak (r[*]=[*] 0. 43, p[*]=[*] 0. 007). Median CFR was 1. 77 (IQ 1. 26 - 2. 42) and was correlated to insulin sensitivity (r 0. 43, p[*]=[*] 0. 008). CFR (r[*]=[*] 0. 48, p[*]=[*] 0. 002), and arterial stiffness (r[*]=[*]− 0. 35, p[*]=[*] 0. 04) were correlated to VO 2 peak whereas endothelial function and <b>LVEF</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> (all p[*]>[*] 0. 15). In multivariable linear regression adjusting for age, CFR remained independently associated with VO 2 peak (standardized coefficient (SC) 1. 98, p[*]=[*] 0. 05) whereas insulin sensitivity (SC 1. 75, p[*]=[*] 0. 09) and arterial stiffness (SC − 1. 17, p[*]=[*] 0. 29) were no longer associated with VO 2 peak. Conclusions The study confirms that insulin resistance is associated with exercise intolerance in heart failure patients and suggests that this is partly through reduced CFR. This is the first study to our knowledge that shows an association between CFR and exercise capacity in heart failure patients and links the relationship between insulin resistance and exercise capacity to CFR. </p...|$|R

In the current study, we only included HF patients with a B-type natriuretic peptide level (BNP) andgt; 100 pg/mL. Quality of life was assessed by Cantrils Ladder of Life, RAND- 36, and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire, and impairment of QoL was adjusted for by BNP as a marker for severity of HF. We examined a total of 290 HF patients, of whom 145 had HF-PEF (41 % female; age 72 +/- 10; LVEF 51 +/- 8 %) and 145 had HF-REF (41 % female; age 73 +/- 10, LVEF 26 +/- 7 %). All HF patients reported markedly low scores of QoL, both on the general and disease-specific QoL questionnaires. Quality of life between patients with HF-PEF and HF-REF did not differ significantly.

40|$|Background—-Elevated {{heart rate}} {{represents}} an independent {{risk factor for}} cardiovascular outcome in patients with heart disease. In the sinoatrial node, rate increase is mediated by β 1 adrenoceptor mediated activation of the Gαs pathway. We hypothesized that genetic inactivation of the stimulatory Gαs protein in the sinoatrial node would provide sinus rate control and would prevent inappropriate heart rate acceleration during β-adrenergic activation. Methods and Results—-Domestic pigs (n= 10) were evenly assigned to receive either Ad-small interfering RNA (siRNA) -Gαs gene therapy to inactivate Gαs or adenovirus encoding for green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) as control. Adenoviruses were applied through virus injection into the sinoatrial node followed by epicardial electroporation, and heart rates were evaluated for 7 days. Genetic inhibition of Gαs protein significantly reduced mean heart rates on day 7 by 16. 5 % compared with control animals (110 ± 8. 8 vs 131 ± 9. 4 beats per minute; P< 0. 01). On β-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol, we observed a tendency toward diminished rate response in the Ad-siRNA-Gαs group (Ad-siRNA-Gαs, + 79. 3 %; Ad-GFP, + 61. 7 %; n= 3 animals per group; P = 0. 294). Adverse effects of gene transfer on left ventricular ejection fraction (<b>LVEF)</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> detected following treatment (LVEFAd-siRNA-Gαs, 66 %; LVEFAd-GFP, 60 %). Conclusions—-In this preclinical proof-of-concept study targeted Ad-siRNA-Gαs gene therapy reduced heart rates during normal sinus rhythm compared with Ad-GFP treatment and prevented inappropriate rate increase after β-adrenergic stimulation. Gene therapy may provide an additional therapeutic option for heart rate reduction in cardiac disease. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2012; 1 :jah 3...|$|R
40|$|The {{proteasome}} {{has been}} identified as a target of the humoral autoimmune response in different inflammatory disease entities including dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, the role of proteasome autoantibodies (ProtAb) remains to be studied. Here, we have isolated human ProtAb by affinity-purification from the IgG fractions obtained from DCM patients, which predominantly detected the outer ring subunits alpha 3 of the 20 S proteasome. In an attempt to study the cellular effects potentially exerted by these ProtAb, simultaneous calcium and cell contractility measurements were performed in rat cardiomyocytes revealing no short-term effects upon human ProtAb exposure. Immunofluorescence staining and FACS analysis pointed towards a failure of human ProtAb to bind to the intact cell membrane, whereas human ProtAb detected 20 S proteasomes in the cytoplasm and nucleus. The lack of the cell surface interaction of human ProtAb was in agreement with the failure of these autoantibodies to interfere with the cellular viability. Further, we investigated whether the removal of ProtAb by immunoadsorption (IA) resulted in functional improvement in DCM patients. IA was performed in 90 DCM patients (left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 45 %, ProtAb detection at baseline in 30 % of these DCM patients). Improvement of <b>LVEF</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> associated with the initial detection and removal of ProtAb in DCM patients.

Probabilistic sensitivity and scenario analyses estimated the uncertainty around the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. An ICD implantation increased the lifetime direct costs by Euro 46 413. Estimated mean LY/QALY gained were 1. 88 / 1. 57, respectively. Probabilistic analysis estimated mean lifetime cost per QALY gained as Euro 31 717 (95 % CI: Euro 19 760 -Euro 61 316).

We followed the clinical course and the evolution of left ventricular (LV) function in 99 pts (78 women, 21 men; mean age 54. 9 ± 7 years) during a mean follow-up of 6. 7 ± 4 years. Patients underwent exercise testing and echocardiographic assessment of LV function at study entry and at follow up. All pts had positive exercise tests and 64 had transient ST depression on Holter monitoring. Transient myocardial ischemia was documented in 32 % of pts by means other than the ECG. During follow up, no deaths or major cardiac events occurred. Exercise tests were positive at follow-up and no differences in exercise test variables were observed compared with tests at study entry. No changes in global or regional wall motion were observed. LV shortening fraction and diastolic and systolic LV diameters remained unchanged during follow-up (35. 4 ± 4 % vs 35. 6 ± 3 %, 49. 6 ± 3 vs 49. 4 ± 3 mm, and 32 ± 2 vs 31. 7 ± 2 respectively), Only 1 pt developed congestive heart failure (LVEF dropped from 57 % to 30 %).

40|$|BackgroundAssessment {{of chronic}} aortic {{regurgitation}} (AR) severity remains challenging. While transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) {{is the most}} widely used method, velocity-encoded phase-contrast magnetic resonance (PCMR) imaging in the ascending aorta for flow quantification is considered the gold standard method to calculate the regurgitant volume (Reg Vol). The aim of our study was to compare the AR severity by TTE and PCMR in a large serie of consecutive patients with aortic valvular heart disease (VHD). Methods and resultsbetween 2007 and 2014, 283 patients underwent clinically indicated TTE and PCMR (Philips ACHIEVA 1. 5 Tesla) within 30 days. Multiparametric approach was used by TTE (vena contracta, pisa method and semi-quantitative method) to grade AR severity.

AR was respectively graded 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 in 51 %, 19 %, 13 %; 8 % and 8 % by TTE which corresponded to a Reg Vol of 5. 3 ± 3. 9 mL, 16 ± 3, 26 ± 4, 37 ± 5, and 57 ± 9 mL respectively as obtained by PCMR. There was no significant overlap between different Reg vol by PCMR and the 5 grade obtained by TTE; The relation between AR- Reg vol and grade by TTE <b>was</b> <b>not</b> significantly affected by the mean trans-aortic gradient (i. e>or< 40 mmHg).

Many of the symptoms of CHF overlap with other disease states such as obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney failure, edema, and liver failure.

BackgroundPrior studies demonstrated that the quantification of myocardial scar volume by CMR is superior to left ventricular end-diastolic volume, left ventricular end-systolic volume, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in predicting future CVE in ICM patients. Evaluation of infarct heterogeneity by measuring infarct core and border zones through CMR might have a higher association with CVE. MethodsSeventy patients (mean LVEF: 25 ± 11 %) considered for revascularization or medical management ± implantable cardiac defibrillator were enrolled. A 1. 5 -T GE MRI (Signa, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) was used to acquire cine and delayed enhancement images.

40|$|Abstract In the {{clinical}} setting, the {{early detection of}} myocardial injury induced by doxorubicin (DXR) is still considered a challenge. To assess whether ultrasonic tissue characterization (UTC) can identify early DXR-related myocardial lesions and their correlation with collagen myocardial percentages, we studied 60 rats at basal status and prospectively after 2 mg/Kg/week DXR endovenous infusion. Echocardiographic examinations were conducted at baseline and at 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 mg/Kg DXR cumulative dose. The left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF), shortening fraction (SF), and the UTC indices: corrected coefficient of integrated backscatter (IBS) (tissue IBS intensity/ phantom IBS intensity) (CC-IBS) and the cyclic variation magnitude of this intensity curve (MCV) were measured. The variation of each parameter of study through DXR dose was expressed by the average and standard error at specific DXR dosages and those at baseline. The collagen percent (%) was calculated in six control group animals and 24 DXR group animals. CC-IBS increased (1. 29 ± 0. 27 x 1. 1 ± 0. 26 -basal; p= 0. 005) and MCV decreased (9. 1 ± 2. 8 x 11. 02 ± 2. 6 -basal; p= 0. 006) from 8 mg/Kg to 16 mg/Kg DXR. LVEF presented only a slight but significant decrease (80. 4 ± 6. 9 % x 85. 3 ± 6. 9 %-basal, p= 0. 005) from 8 mg/Kg to 16 mg/Kg DXR. CC-IBS was 72. 2 % sensitive and 83. 3 % specific to detect collagen deposition of 4. 24 %(AUC= 0. 76). <b>LVEF</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> accurate to detect initial collagen deposition (AUC= 0. 54).
