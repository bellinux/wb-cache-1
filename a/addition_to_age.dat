50|$|The splenic sinuses of the spleen, {{also known}} as sinusoids, are wide vessels that drain into trabecular veins.

50|$|Also, {{there are}} other {{variables}} in <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>age</b> that are suggested to confound the interpretation of BMD as measured by DXA. One important confounding variable is bone size. DXA {{has been shown to}} overestimate the bone mineral density of taller subjects and underestimate the bone mineral density of smaller subjects.

5000|$|In the U.S., {{each state}} {{has its own}} laws {{regarding}} age discrimination, {{and there are also}} federal laws. [...] In California, the Fair Employment and Housing Act forbids unlawful discrimination against persons age 40 and older.

In <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>age,</b> it prohibits employment discrimination based on race or color; religion; national origin or ancestry, disability, mental type or medical condition; marital status; sex or sexual orientation; and pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.

5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} personal factor that predisposes to an increased risk is age. In the United States in 1998 17 million workers were over age 55 and by 2018 this population is expected to more than double. Workers {{in this age group}} are more likely to suffer from lower back pain that may be worsened by work conditions that normally do not affect a younger worker. Older workers are also more likely by be killed in a construction related fall. They are also at higher risk for injury due to age-related hearing loss, visual impairment, and use of multiple prescription medications that has been linked to higher rates of work injuries.

5000|$|If {{the jury}} was {{satisfied}} that the defendant was provoked, the test was whether a reasonable person would have acted as the defendant did - an objective test.It was held in Camplin that the accused's age and sex {{could be attributed to}} the reasonable man when the jury considered the defendant's power of self-control. Further, that any characteristic of the accused could be included which the jury considered may affect the gravity of the provocation.Therefore the reasonable person had to be endowed with the particular characteristics of the accused. In a number of leading cases, Morhall and Luc Thiet Thuan v R, it was held that the judge should direct the jury to consider whether an ordinary person with ordinary powers of self-control would have reacted to the provocation as the defendant did and that no allowance should be given for any characteristics that might have made him or her more volatile than the ordinary person. These decisions acknowledged, however, that, in <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>age</b> and sex, characteristics which affected the gravity of the provocation to the defendant should be taken into account.

Poor health, particularly in <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>ageing,</b> is strongly associated with work ability among {{a variety of different}} socio-economic groups.
