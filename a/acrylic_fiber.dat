40|$|Wastes of <b>acrylic</b> <b>fibers</b> were {{chemically}} modified {{in order to}} obtain adsorbents. The fibers were thermally treated with aqueous solutions of H 2 SO 4 or NaOH at various concentrations. The adsorption ability of the modified <b>acrylic</b> <b>fibers</b> and commercial adsorbents for comparison reasons was evaluated on the basis of dye-adsorption of methylene blue (having electron donor groups) and alizarin yellow (having mainly electron acceptor groups). The chemical structure of the modified <b>acrylic</b> <b>fibers</b> was determined by IR spectroscopy. The experimental results of the dye adsorption were theoretically treated by using a diffusion-limited adsorption method, which was applied for short reaction times. Adsorption kinetics parameters and the diffusion coefficients were calculated. The electron donor-acceptor (EDA) interactions between the functional groups of the polymers and those of the dyes influence strongly the adsorption process. The modified <b>acrylic</b> <b>fibers</b> adsorb both dyes better than the commercial adsorbents...|$|R

50|$|Organic {{cyanides}} {{are usually}} called nitriles; in these, the CN group is linked by a covalent bond to a carbon-containing group, such as methyl (CH3) in methyl cyanide (acetonitrile). Because {{they do not}} release cyanide ions, nitriles are generally less toxic, {{or in the case}} of insoluble polymers such as <b>acrylic</b> <b>fiber,</b> essentially nontoxic unless burned. Hydrocyanic acid, also known as hydrogen cyanide, or HCN, is a highly volatile liquid used to prepare acrylonitrile, which is used in the production of acrylic fibers, synthetic rubber, and plastics. Cyanides are employed in a number of chemical processes, including fumigation, case hardening of iron and steel, electroplating, and the concentration of ores. In nature, substances yielding cyanide are present in certain seeds, such as the pit of the cherry and the seeds of apples.|$|E

Two pieces of carpet untreated and treated with BAC solution sewed together and laid for one week in the public place and the amounts of bacterial growth determined by colony count method and the results compared. Finally some mechanical properties of treated <b>acrylic</b> <b>fibers</b> measured after 30 days and compared with untreated one.

5000|$|A {{standard}} channel letter is a three-dimensional graphic sign element. Its channel is fabricated from sheet metal, most often aluminum since {{it will not}} rust.
