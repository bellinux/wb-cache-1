Later, Migg and Tom play Risk and drink wine. Tom is concerned that Gerri has not called. When Tom heads out to buy cigarettes and wine, Migg hides Tom's mobile and deletes an <b>answerphone</b> message left by Tom's colleague Stevie (Hill).|$|E
25|$|Strange {{finds that}} his home has been burgled and his files {{relating}} to the Oliver case stolen. He has an <b>answerphone</b> message threatening him with obstruction of justice {{as one of the}} witnesses he interviewed gave him information that he should have passed to the police. Strange was unaware of the requirement and seeks advice from Oliver's legal team.|$|E
25|$|Strange and Quinn meet at {{the beauty}} salon and find that McKinley has {{abducted}} Stokes. They ambush him at his home and rescue her. McKinley has had his enforcer Mike Montgomery take her son to a separate location. Quinn takes Stokes home and finds that Montgomery has {{had a change of}} heart and returned the boy. Strange cuts McKinley and McKinley threatens him in a way similar to the <b>answerphone</b> message. Strange leaves McKinley injured but alive. McKinley calls Foreman for help when he is unable to get hold of Montgomery and tries to recruit him into attacking Durham. When they confront Durham Foreman shoots McKinley and rants about not taking orders from drug dealers.|$|E
500|$|The game {{allows the}} player to request {{chemical}} and nuclear tactical strikes against the enemy. A chemical attack is automatically targeted at an enemy capital city, and will {{conclude with a}} readout announcing {{the outcome of the}} attack, such as civilian casualties. In order to launch a strategic nuclear attack, the player is given 30 seconds to call a dedicated 1-800 telephone number and obtain a special authorisation code from the automated <b>answerphone</b> message. Once the authorisation code has been received, the player will be given three separate options on how to proceed. Standby mode will postpone the nuclear launch, whereas a strategic launch will involve one nuclear warhead targeting a city. The third option, known as [...] "Fire-Plan", will issue a full-scale nuclear strike across Europe and may result in a nuclear holocaust, which will end the game.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 October, Brand {{presented}} his last {{edition of his}} radio show with co-host Simon Amstell, which they performed live. Shortly before going on air, Brand was informed that The Mail on Sunday would be running {{a story about the}} phone calls. During the show, Brand apologised to Sachs, but also devoted much of the show to deriding the Daily Mail for its support of Nazism in the run up to World War II. Even in his apology to Sachs, Brand stated [...] "what's worse – leaving a swearword on Andrew Sachs' <b>answerphone</b> or tacitly supporting Adolf Hitler when he took charge of the Third Reich?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Following his suspension, Alderman {{returned}} to the Australian side and resumed his success against England, taking 41 wickets in the 1989 Ashes series and another 16 in the 1990–91 series, his final Ashes appearance. The scorebook entry [...] "Gooch lbw b Alderman" [...] assumed {{a life of its}} own in the summer of 1989, manifesting itself as a chilling refrain that haunted the slumbers of traumatised England cricket fans, and earning acknowledgement by Gooch himself on his <b>answerphone</b> message: [...] "I'm out - probably lbw to Terry Alderman". He rarely enjoyed similar success against other countries. His final Test series was against the West Indies in 1990–91, where he ended his career with 170 Test wickets.|$|E
2500|$|During several {{episodes in}} the revival show's {{second and third}} series, a man known as [...] "Saxon" [...] or [...] "Harold Saxon" [...] is mentioned. In [...] "Love & Monsters" [...] (2006), Victor Kennedy (Peter Kay) is reading a {{newspaper}} with the headline [...] "Saxon leads polls with 64 per cent". In [...] "The Runaway Bride", the British Army are heard being given orders from [...] "Mr Saxon" [...] to fire upon the Racnoss Webstar. In [...] "Smith and Jones" [...] (2007), medical student Oliver Morgenstern (Ben Righton) tells the news that [...] "Mr Saxon" [...] was proven right about there being life beyond Earth. A poster with the words [...] "Vote Saxon" [...] also appears in the episode. In [...] "The Lazarus Experiment", Francine Jones (Adjoa Andoh) leaves an <b>answerphone</b> message for her daughter Martha (Freema Agyeman), warning her that the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) is [...] "not safe" [...] and [...] "This information comes from Harold Saxon himself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zoe's arrival {{establishes}} the hostile {{nature of the}} neighbourhood, as she has been mugged by a local gang (the [...] "Daughters of Darkness") – led by Rita. Most of the first scene of Act 1 involves the explanation of Jerome's composing, his writer's block, his need for Geain's return, his plan to act out a stable home life with Zoe, and the breakdown in law and order. Jerome describes how he writes his music by sampling real life sounds and manipulating them. Several times he plays back dialogue which has taken place on stage or in rooms off-stage. He explains {{that he wants to}} write a piece which encapsulates the concept of love – but he has been searching for four years for the right sound to sample. The action on stage is interrupted by several video sequences involving comings and goings at the front door, film of Geain when she was 9 years old, and video <b>answerphone</b> messages from Jerome's friend Lupus and from Mervyn. Rita, Lupus and the younger Geain only ever appear on video, as does Mary Hope-Fitch from the agency which supplied Zoe.|$|E

5000|$|The voices heard {{during the}} hidden track [...] "Evil Dildo" [...] are actual death threats left on Molko's <b>answerphone.</b> The second of these voices, over the outro to this song (starting at roughly 21:30), {{is exactly the}} same as that in the outro of the Aphex Twin song 'Funny Little Man' on the Come To Daddy EP, which was {{released}} almost exactly a year before this album.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the album}} was {{conceived}} {{as a reaction to}} Britpop which the band felt represented a [...] "conservative backwards movement in music" [...] they soon realised that they were in an [...] "old 70's studio making a 70's rock album". [...] Former members Rhys Ifans and Dic Ben contributed to the track [...] "Long Gone" [...] by leaving an <b>answerphone</b> message which plays as the song comes to a close.|$|E

50|$|In {{support of}} Abandoned Buildings, Parsons drew an {{animated}} film {{to accompany the}} album.

King left the band in late 2002 after several recording sessions for the album that was eventually released as Kleptomania, leading to the band's split.|$|E

Sarah ends her relationship with Tom, and the film finishes with Tom dropping another pill, and dancing his troubles away.|$|E
5000|$|Vicki Vale can {{be heard}} on an <b>answerphone</b> in Wayne Tower in Batman: Arkham Knight.

5000|$|Terence Michael Alderman (born 12 June 1956 in Subiaco, Western Australia, Australia) is {{a former}} Australian cricketer who played {{primarily}} as a right-arm fast-medium bowler of limited pace but nagging accuracy and movement.

The message also featured the line [...] "On the 2nd of October 2016, we'll die holding hands", a reference to a line in [...] "Suzanne".|$|E
5000|$|In {{common with}} a number of British shows of its era, humour often came from {{repetition}} of catchphrases or situations. These included Sean's love of The Smiths and Morrissey; conversations with a spider who was actually Elvis Presley; messages on the <b>answerphone</b> from Samuel Beckett and God; [...] "That sock's still not dry"; phone calls from a girl called Angela who Sean definitely [...] "did not lead on"; refugees in the bedroom who do nothing but comment inanely on television programmes; attempts to get scrambled egg from a saucepan and many, many more.|$|E

50|$|Soon afterward, a {{construction}} worker at the school sees {{what looks like a}} woman's body in a hole being filled with concrete.
