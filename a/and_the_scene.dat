5|$|In 2012, {{the feature}} film Nema Aviona za Zagreb premiered in the Netherlands with an {{exclusive}} interview with Meher Baba filmed in 1967. In the interview Baba explains the difference between God-realization and drug-induced hallucinations <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> plays a pivotal role in the documentary's narrative.|$|E
5|$|In post-production, Universal {{decided to}} film a new scene for the ending that would feature a reunion between Stiller and Murphy's characters. Murphy, however, refused to return unless he were paid a further $500,000 {{on top of}} his $7.5million salary. The studio {{declined}} to pay the additional money <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> was not shot.|$|E
5|$|John Turturro as Jesus Quintana. The Coen {{brothers}} let Turturro {{come up with}} a lot of his {{own ideas}} for the character, like shining the bowling ball <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> where he dances backwards, which he says was inspired by Muhammad Ali.|$|E

5|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} varied widely, {{but there was more}} {{positive}} reaction than not. The greatest enthusiasm was for Rachel's fathers, though Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) was complimented on his brief scenes, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> with Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Karofsky (Max Adler) was also praised. The episode was also significant because it featured an on-screen kiss by Santana (Naya Rivera) and Brittany (Heather Morris), which was the show's first lesbian kiss.|$|E
5|$|The {{instrumental}} music {{was written by}} George Bruns and orchestrated by Walter Sheets. Two of the cues were reused from previous Disney films. The scene where Mowgli wakes up after escaping King Louie used one of Bruns' themes for Sleeping Beauty; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> where Bagheera gives a eulogy to Baloo when he mistakenly thinks the bear was killed by Shere Khan used Paul J. Smith's organ score from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.|$|E
5|$|When Lark {{received}} the first script, he was disappointed. He felt {{none of the}} characters were likable, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> Rucka had described to him over dinner was not included. Rucka wrote a new draft to address Lark's concerns and restored the missing opening scene. Lark began drawing the first issue in January 2013 and based the opening scene on the birth sequence in The Fifth Element.|$|E

5|$|A deleted {{scene from}} this episode is {{included}} on the complete thirteenth season DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets. It shows the boys taking Michael Jackson (in Ike's body) to the Glendale location of Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks & Mortuaries to prove he is dead. When they reach the grave, Jackson denies it and Kyle attempts to show him by taking a shovel and digging his grave. Stan at first opposes but he, with Cartman and Kenny take shovels <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> ends with the boys digging Jackson's grave to show he is dead while Ike/Jackson dances. Jackson's grave shows his date of death as July 25, 2009, when in fact he died on June 25.|$|E
5|$|After Belushi's wife Judy and Aykroyd had a {{talk with}} Belushi about his antics, the {{production}} returned to Los Angeles. Filming there again ran smoothly, until {{it came time to}} shoot the final sequence at the Hollywood Palladium. Just beforehand, Belushi fell off a borrowed skateboard and seriously injured his knee, making it unlikely he could go through with the scene, which required him to sing, dance, and do cartwheels. Wasserman persuaded the city's top orthopedic surgeon to postpone his weekend plans long enough to stop by and sufficiently anesthetize Belushi's knee, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> was filmed as intended.|$|E
5|$|By {{moving the}} pan-tilt {{units of the}} laser range finders, it is also {{possible}} to obtain a point cloud in three dimensions. Technical readjustment between the model of the aircraft <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> point cloud is already used in navigation to estimate the static placement of the robot. It is planned to make targeted acquisitions, simpler in terms of movement, to verify the absence of chocks in front of the landing gear wheels, or the proper closing of engine cowling latches.|$|E
50|$|Iceland {{was used}} to depict <b>the</b> far north, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> from this episode (<b>and</b> <b>the</b> next one) were filmed at the glacier Svínafellsjökull in Vatnajökull National Park, close to Skaftafell.|$|R

5|$|Certain {{scenes in}} Cannibal Holocaust {{have also been}} noted as being similar to scenes in Antonio Climati's Mondo film Savana violenta, {{specifically}} the scene in which Monroe bathes naked in the river <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> of the forced abortion rite. The cinéma vérité style used heavily in Cannibal Holocaust was also used before in Climati's first Mondo film, Ultime grida dalla savana, in a scene where a tourist is attacked and killed by a pride of lions. Another scene, in which a native man is captured, tortured, and murdered by mercenaries in South America, uses a similar filming style, and both scenes may have been influential on Deodato's direction.|$|E
5|$|For {{the scenery}} design, layout {{supervisor}} Rasoul Azadani took many {{pictures of his}} hometown of Isfahan, Iran for guidance. Other inspirations for design were Disney's animated films from the 1940s and 50s and the 1940 film The Thief of Bagdad. The coloring {{was done with the}} computerized CAPS process, and the color motifs were chosen according to the personality – the protagonists use light colors such as blue, the antagonists darker ones such as red and black, and Agrabah and its palace use the neutral color yellow. Computer animation was used for some elements of the film, such as the tiger entrance of the Cave of Wonders <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> where Aladdin tries to escape the collapsing cave.|$|E
5|$|Herm {{was first}} {{discovered}} in the Mesolithic period, and the first settlers arrived in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Many tombs from that period remain today, {{the majority in the}} north of the island. The island was annexed to the Duchy of Normandy in 933, but returned to the English Crown with the division of Normandy in 1204. It was occupied by Germany in the Second World War <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> of Operation Huckaback, but was largely bypassed. Herm is currently managed by Herm Island Ltd, formed by Starboard Settlement, who acquired Herm in 2008, following fears during the sale of the island that the 'identity' of the island was at threat.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>scenes</b> in <b>the</b> {{school were}} {{shot in the}} village of Tomaš near Bjelovar, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> in <b>the</b> snow near Grginac on the {{railroad}} between Bjelovar and Kloštar Podravski, with snow-blowers from Planica in Slovenia to provide artificial snow. At the end of <b>the</b> shooting, several <b>scenes</b> could be taken in real snow, which had started falling.|$|R

50|$|The artwork sees {{again the}} {{collaboration}} with <b>the</b> graphic artist <b>and</b> photographer Anna Taschini.

5|$|In 1936 the new Labour {{administration}} of the London County Council renamed White Cross Street, {{near the site of}} the Red Cross Hall <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> of the Union Street fire, to Ayres Street in tribute to Alice Ayres, a name it retains today. The Chandlers' house at 194 Union Street no longer stands, and the site is occupied by part of the Union House office complex; immediately opposite the site of the fire is the present-day headquarters of the London Fire Brigade.|$|E
5|$|On 5 March 2012, {{prior to}} release, Kolkata Metro {{authorities}} objected to {{a scene in}} which Vidya is pushed by a man onto the tracks as a train arrives. They requested that the scene be removed, as it would remind people of the past suicides, which had tarnished the railway's image. The filmmakers screened the scene for the authorities and explained that nothing in the film would affect the image of the Metro or prompt people to commit suicide. Convinced, the officials withdrew their objections, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> was retained, although it was removed from trailers.|$|E
5|$|The Travel Inn in Tujunga, California, was repainted {{and used}} as the {{interior}} of Leonard's and Dodd's motel rooms and {{the exterior of the}} film's Discount Inn. Scenes in Sammy Jankis' house were shot in a suburban home close to Pasadena, while Natalie's house was located in Burbank. The crew planned to shoot the derelict building set (where Leonard kills Teddy and Jimmy) in a Spanish-styled brick building owned by a train company. However, one week before shooting began, the company placed several dozen train carriages outside the building, making the exterior unfilmable. Since the interior of the building had already been built as a set, a new location had to be found. An oil refinery near Long Beach was used instead, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> where Leonard burns his wife's possessions was filmed {{on the other side of}} the refinery.|$|E

5|$|The next {{scenes were}} the El Rancho nightclub scenes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> in which Susan {{attempts}} suicide. Welles later {{said that the}} nightclub set was available after another film had wrapped and that filming took 10 to 12 days to complete. For these scenes Welles had Comingore's throat sprayed with chemicals to give her voice a harsh, raspy tone. Other scenes shot in secret included those in which Thompson interviews Leland and Bernstein, which were also shot on sets built for other films.|$|E
5|$|The stunt {{crew was}} the same one used in Cruise's Mission: Impossible 2, and was {{responsible}} for complex action scenes. These included the auto factory chase scene, filmed in a real facility using props such as a welding robot, and the fight between Anderton and the jetpack-clad officers, filmed in an alley set built on the Warner Bros. studio lot. Industrial Light & Magic {{did most of the}} special effects, and DreamWorks-owned PDI was responsible for the Spyder robots. The company Pixel Liberation Front did previsualization animatics. The holographic projections and the prison facility were filmed by several roving cameras which surrounded the actors, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> where Anderton gets off his car and runs along the Maglev vehicles was filmed on stationary props, which were later replaced by computer-generated vehicles.|$|E
5|$|A detective named Havez (Dwight McFee) {{takes over}} as Bruckman's guard when Mulder and Scully {{are called to}} {{investigate}} yet another new murder victim: the tarot card reader. As they leave they bump into a bellhop who is delivering food to Bruckman's room. The bellhop is actually the killer, and when he enters the room (while Havez is in the washroom), he is delighted to discover that Bruckman has been brought right to where he works. As {{he is about to}} kill Bruckman, Havez re-enters and the killer attacks and kills him instead. Meanwhile, Scully finds the same silk fiber at the new crime scene, and realizing that the bellhop had it on his tray, deduces that he is the murderer. They rush back to the hotel. Mulder chases the killer to the basement kitchen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> plays out as described in Bruckman's earlier premonition, but when the killer attacks Mulder, Scully arrives {{in the nick of time}} and shoots him—what Bruckman had seen was the dying killer's last thoughts, not Mulder's death.|$|E
50|$|The {{climax of}} the picture takes place in Berchtesgaden, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> of Heisemann being chased through the rubble were filmed inside the ruins of Hitler's house just before its final {{demolition}} by the German government.
