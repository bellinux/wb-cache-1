500|$|On Madagascar, the {{distribution}} of M.griveaudi extends along the western lowlands north to Ankarana in the far north of the island, and on eastern Madagascar south to the vicinity of Daraina. It is found up to [...] above sea level and often occurs in karstic areas. Its range extensively overlaps that of M.aelleni, which is regularly found in the same forests and caves.

500|$|Miniopterus aelleni {{is known}} to live from [...] above sea level in {{northern}} and western Madagascar, at [...] on Montagne d'Ambre, northern Madagascar, and from [...] on Anjouan in the nearby Comoros. On Madagascar, it has been recorded in forest and caves in karst areas; its distribution broadly overlaps that of M.griveaudi and the two {{have been found in}} the same roost sites on several occasions. On Anjouan, M.aelleni is less common than M.griveaudi; there, it is known from four specimens only, all collected in 2006. These come from two nearby sites: a rocky area near a river and a disturbed forest. These animals, collected in late November, were in reproductive condition, with two females pregnant and a third lactating. M.griveaudi were reproductively active at the same time, suggesting that the reproductive seasons of the two do not differ significantly. Although some ecological <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> <b>data</b> has been published on Miniopterus manavi, the recognition of several cryptic species within this group, more than one of which may occur in any given locality, renders the association of these data with any of the individual species uncertain; however, species of Miniopterus generally feed on insects. Because M.aelleni is widespread and occurs in many protected areas on Madagascar, Goodman and colleagues inferred that its conservation status is secure.|$|E

40|$|Mesial {{temporal}} lobe epilepsy (MTLE) can {{be associated with}} emotion recognition impairment that can be particularly severe in patients with early onset seizures (1 - 3). Whereas there is growing evidence that memory and language can improve in seizure-free patients after anterior {{temporal lobe}}ctomy (ATL) (4), the effects of surgery on emotional processing are still unknown. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate short-term reorganization of networks engaged in facial emotion recognition in MTLE patients. <b>Behavioral</b> <b>and</b> fMRI <b>data</b> were collected from six patients before and after ATL.
