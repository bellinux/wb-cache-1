5|$|Norton Internet Security 2000, {{released}} January 10, 2000, was Symantec's {{first foray}} beyond virus protection and content control filters. Its release followed an alliance between Internet provider Excite@Home and antivirus vendor McAfee.com to provide Internet subscribers with McAfee's new firewall software, McAfee Personal Firewall. Version 2000s firewall, based on AtGuard from WRQ, filters traffic at the packet level. It can block ActiveX controls and Java <b>applets.</b> Other functionalities include cookie removal, and banner ad blocking. ZDNet found the ad blocker removed graphics {{that were not}} ads, breaking pages. Adjusting the settings fixed the problem, however the process was complicated. ZDNet noted {{the lack of information}} presented concerning attacks the firewall blocked. Norton LiveUpdate downloads and installs program updates.|$|E
5|$|The {{firewall}} scans for Internet-enabled {{applications and}} creates access rules {{based on a}} knowledge base maintained by Symantec during installation. In PC Magazine testing, the installation took 24 minutes to complete on a 750MHz Pentium III with 92 Internet-enabled applications. Using the firewall, users can determine whether to accept cookies, Java <b>applets,</b> and ActiveX controls on a global or per-site basis. A new feature, Intrusion Detection with AutoBlock, can detect port scans and block further intrusion attempts. The program provides notifications for intrusion attempts, stating the severity level and providing access to threat details. Alternatively, the firewall can put the computer in stealth, essentially hiding the system. Users can configure the security level, affecting the number of notifications. Testing conducted by PC Magazine using Shields Up and Symantec's Security Check found that the firewall successfully stealthed all ports, hiding the computer from view. A leak test was conducted to see the firewall's ability to detect outbound connections. Each attempt was detected and the suite offered to block the attempts.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} JAIL, a {{tool for}} the static analysis and the verification of the <b>applet</b> isolation property of Java Card, where <b>applet</b> isolation means that one <b>applet</b> can not access the fields or objects of an <b>applet</b> in another context unless the other <b>applet</b> explicitly provides an interface for access. The tool statically checks whether the analyzed source code violates this property, thus detecting if SecurityExceptions are possibly raised in the JCRE...|$|R
25|$|New Plasma <b>applets</b> include <b>applets</b> {{for leaving}} {{messages}} on a locked screen, previewing files, switching desktop Activity, monitoring news feeds, and utilities like the pastebin applet, the calendar, timer, special character selector, a QuickLaunch widget, {{and a system}} monitor, among many others. The Plasma workspace can now load Google Gadgets. Plasma widgets can be written in Ruby and Python. Support for <b>applets</b> written in JavaScript and Mac OS X dashboard widgets has been further improved. Theming improvements in the Task Bar, Application Launcher, System Tray and most other Plasma components streamline {{the look and feel}} and increase consistency. A new System Settings module, Desktop Theme Details, gives the user control over each element of various Plasma themes. Wallpapers are now provided plugins, so developers can easily write custom wallpaper systems in KDE 4.2. Available wallpaper plugins in KDE 4.2 will be slideshows, Mandelbrot fractals, and regular static images.|$|E

25|$|The {{initial release}} of Windows XP in 2001 did not ship with a Java virtual machine, {{because of the}} {{settlement}} with Sun. The settlement required {{people who wanted to}} run Java <b>Applets</b> in Internet Explorer to download and install either the standard Sun Java virtual machine, or to download a copy of the Microsoft Java virtual machine.|$|E

25|$|Currently, web-integrated crystal {{structure}} visualization {{is based on}} Java <b>applets</b> from open-source projects such as Jmol. Web-integrated {{crystal structure}} visualization is tailored for examining crystal structures in web browsers, often supporting wide color spectra (up to 32 bit) and window size adaptation. However, web-generated crystal structure images are not always suitable for publishing due to issues such as resolution depth, color choice, grayscale contrast, or labeling (positioning, font type, font size).|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{researchers}} have discovered numerous security flaws in some widely used Java implementations, including Oracle's, which allow untrusted code {{to bypass the}} sandboxing mechanism, exposing users to malicious attacks. These flaws affect only Java applications which execute arbitrary untrusted bytecode, such as web browser plug-ins that run Java <b>applets</b> downloaded from public websites. Applications where the user trusts, and has full control over, all code that is being executed are unaffected.|$|E
25|$|Windows Sidebar {{is a new}} panel {{which can}} be placed on either the left or the {{right-hand}} side of the screen where a user can place Desktop Gadgets, which are small <b>applets</b> designed for a specialized purpose (such as displaying the weather or sports scores). The gadgets can also be placed on other parts of the desktop, if desired, by dragging. By default, Windows Vista ships with 11 gadgets: Calendar, Clock, Contacts, CPU Meter, Currency Conversion, Feed Headlines, Notes, Picture Puzzle, Slide Show, Stocks, and Weather. Additional gadgets were published at Microsoft's web site, which offered both Microsoft-created and user-submitted gadgets in a gallery. This feature was removed for security reasons.|$|E
5000|$|Developers {{can develop}} and debug an <b>applet</b> {{directly}} simply {{by creating a}} main routine (either in the <b>applet's</b> class or in a separate class) and calling init (...) and start (...) on the <b>applet,</b> thus allowing for development in their favorite Java SE development environment. All one has to do after that is re-test the <b>applet</b> in the AppletViewer program or a web browser to ensure it conforms to security restrictions.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Applet</b> Firewall: Unlike other Java VMs, a Java Card VM usually manages several applications, {{each one}} {{controlling}} sensitive data. Different applications are therefore separated {{from each other}} by an <b>applet</b> firewall which restricts and checks access of data elements of one <b>applet</b> to another.|$|R

25|$|The website {{supports}} drag-and-drop capabilities, one-click editing, plain-language event adding, as well {{as unique}} features aimed towards social networkers. Calendars can contain feeds from Twitter, Blogger, MySpace, Facebook, WordPress, Vox, and Upcoming.org, which generates a social timeline listing all of a user's recent online activity. Users can also import and export data as ics or csv files, or as an RSS feed. The website includes a plain-language event adding feature, which allows users to type phrases such as “Drinks with Richard, tomorrow, 7-9pm, Flute and Whistle”. The website then translates the phrase into an event, determining the location, time, date, and description. Users can add buddies and share calendars with them. 30 Boxes features a simple webtop, which summarizes daily appointments and to-do items. Users can also add <b>applets</b> to the page, such as Google search, Yahoo! Mail, and Google Calendar, a competing online calendar service. 30 Boxes also offers a mobile version of their calendar.|$|E
