5|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was that}} the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy {{has come to be}} known as the Option Play. If the NVA could take Khe Sanh, <b>all</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> good for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but there were limits to the price they were willing to pay. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.|$|E
25|$|Botham {{continued}} to play for England under Brearley and achieved the highpoint {{of his career in}} the next three Tests as England recovered to win The Ashes. In the third Test at Headingley, Australia opened with 401 for 9 declared, despite good bowling by Botham who took 6 for 95. England responded poorly and were dismissed for 174. Botham was the only batsman to perform at <b>all</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> scored 50, which was his first Test half-century since he had been awarded the captaincy thirteen Tests earlier. Having been forced to follow-on, England collapsed again and at 135 for 7 on the afternoon of the fourth day, an innings defeat looked certain. Bookmakers had reportedly been offering odds of 500/1 against an England win after the follow-on was enforced. Botham, himself not long at the wicket, was the remaining recognised batsman as he was joined by the fast bowler Graham Dilley, number nine in the batting order, with only Chris Old and Bob Willis to come. With able support from Dilley (56) and Old (29), Botham hit out and by the close of play was 145 not out with Willis hanging on at the other end on 1 not out. England's lead was just 124 but there remained a glimmer of hope. On the final day's play, there was time for four more runs from Botham before Willis was out and Botham was left on 149 not out. Australia, with plenty of time remaining, needed 130 to win and were generally expected to get them. After Botham took the first wicket, Willis took 8 for 43 to dismiss Australia for only 111. England had won by 18 runs and it was {{only the second time in}} history that a team following on had won a Test match.|$|E

In one match a batsman who had been celebrating a special event the previous evening was rapped on the pad by a ball. At once the bowler asked: [...] "How is he?" [...] Said Alec, shaking his head sadly: [...] "He's not at <b>all</b> <b>well,</b> <b>and</b> he was even worse last night." [...] Occasionally the joke went against Alec. In a game in 1948 he turned down a strong appeal by the Australian touring team. A little later a dog ran onto the field, and Sid Barnes captured it, carried it to Skelding and said: 'Here you are. All you want now is a white stick!' ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 1958, {{having won}} 56 {{national}} and international singles and doubles titles, Gibson retired from amateur tennis. Prior to the Open Era there was no prize money at major tournaments, and direct endorsement deals were prohibited. Players were limited to meager expense allowances, strictly regulated by the USTA. [...] "The truth, to put it bluntly, is that my finances were in heartbreaking shape," [...] she wrote. [...] "Being the Queen of Tennis is <b>all</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> good, but you can't eat a crown. Nor can you send the Internal Revenue Service a throne clipped to their tax forms. The landlord and grocer and tax collector are funny that way: they like cold cash ... I reign over an empty bank account, and I'm not going to fill it by playing amateur tennis." [...] Professional tours for women were still 15 years away, so her opportunities were largely limited to promotional events. [...] In 1959 she signed to play a series of exhibition matches against Karol Fageros before Harlem Globetrotter basketball games. When the tour ended she won the singles and doubles titles at the Pepsi Cola World Pro Tennis Championships in Cleveland, but received only $500 in prize money.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 October 1939, Britain refused Hitler's {{offer of}} peace and on 12 October, France did the same. Colonel-General Franz Halder (Chief of the General Staff of OKH), {{presented}} the first plan for Fall Gelb (Case Yellow) on 19 October. This was the pre-war codename of plans for a campaign in the Low Countries: the Aufmarschanweisung N°1, Fall Gelb (Deployment Instruction No. 1, Case Yellow). Halder's plan {{has been compared to}} the Schlieffen Plan, the name given to the German strategy of 1914 in the First World War. It was similar in that both plans entailed an advance through the middle of Belgium. Aufmarschanweisung N°1 envisioned a frontal attack, sacrificing a projected half million German soldiers to attain the limited goal of throwing the Allies back to the River Somme. Germany's strength for 1940 would then be spent; only in 1942 could the main attack against France begin. When Hitler raised objections to the plan and instead advocated for a decisive armoured breakthrough as had happened in the invasion of Poland, Halder and Brauchitsch attempted to dissuade him, arguing that while the fast-moving mechanised tactics were <b>all</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> good against a [...] "shoddy" [...] Eastern European army, they would not work against a first-rate military like the French.|$|E

2500|$|Eyvind Earle joined Walt Disney Productions in 1951 first {{employed}} {{as an assistant}} background painter for Peter Pan before being promoted as a full-fledged background painter in the Goofy cartoon, [...] "For Whom the Bulls Toil" [...] and the color stylist of the Academy Award-winning short, Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom. For Sleeping Beauty, Earle said he [...] "felt totally free to put my own style" [...] into the paintings he based on Hench's drawings stating [...] "Where his trees might have curved, I straightened them out…. I took a Hench and took the same subject, and the composition he had, and just turned in into my style." [...] Furthermore, Earle found inspiration in Italian Renaissance utilizing works from Albrecht Dürer, Pieter Bruegel, Nicolaas van Eyck, Sandro Botticelli, as well as Persian art and Japanese prints. When Geronimi became the supervising director, Earle and Geronimi entered furious creative divisions. Geronimi commented that he felt Earle's paintings [...] "lacked the mood {{in a lot of}} things. All that beautiful detail in the trees, the bark, and all that, that's <b>all</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> good, but who the hell's going to look at that? [...] The backgrounds became more important than the animation. He'd made them more like Christmas cards." [...] Earle left the Disney studios in March 1958, before Sleeping Beauty was completed, to take a job at the John Sutherland studio. As a result, Geronimi had Earle's background paintings softened and diluted from their distinctive medieval texture.|$|E
