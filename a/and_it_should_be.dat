New advances in digital radiography, coupled with much lower x-ray dosages may herald better MMR technologies.|$|E

500|$|Historians {{agree that}} four major barges were built. While there are {{believed}} to have been earlier vessels, the bucentaur of 1311 is regarded as the first significant one, for on 17 August 1311 the promissione was amended to add the statement [...] "quod Bucentaurus Domini ducis fiat per Dominium et teneatur in Arsenatu" [...] ("...that a Bucentaur should be made for the Lord Doge for his rule, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> held in the Arsenale"). This {{was the first time that}} Venetian law had provided that the expense of building the bucentaur was to be borne by the public budget. The two-decked bucentaur had a tiemo (canopy) with two sections, one in purple velvet for the doge, the other in red velvet for Venetian nobles. The historian Marino Sanuto the Younger, in his work De origine, situ et magistratibus urbis Venetae (On the Origin, Site and Officials of the City of Venice), also described the ship as bearing a sculpture of Justice.|$|E

[...] Winner of the 1990 Booker Prize, A. S. Byatt called it a [...] "sexist prize", {{claiming}} [...] "such a prize was never needed." [...] In 1999, the chairwoman of the judges, Lola Young, said that the British fiction they were asked to appraise fell into two categories, either [...] "insular and parochial" [...] or [...] "domestic in a piddling kind of way", unlike American authors who [...] "take small, intimate stories and set them against this vast physical and cultural landscape which is very appealing.". Linda Grant suffered accusations of plagiarism following her award in 2000, while the following year, a panel of male critics produced their own shortlist and heavily criticised the genuine shortlist. Though full of praise for the winner of the 2007 prize, the chair of the judging panel Muriel Gray decried {{the fact that}} the shortlist had to be whittled down from [...] "a lot of dross", while former editor of The Times Simon Jenkins called it [...] "sexist".
