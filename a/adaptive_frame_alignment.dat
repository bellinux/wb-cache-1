Based on this idea, a dynamic frame-slotted Aloha protocol was first proposed about three decades ago for general data networks and has been applied to RFID systems in recent years. In dynamic frame-slotted Aloha protocols, it is generally required to estimate accurately the number of tags to be inventoried, which is not easy. In this section, we propose two algorithms, called <b>adaptive</b> <b>frame</b> size Aloha 1 (AFSA 1) and <b>adaptive</b> <b>frame</b> size Aloha 2 (AFSA 2), to give another solution for the dynamic Aloha anti-collision problem.|$|R

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{address the}} problem of visual recognition of non-rigid objects. I introduce the <b>frame</b> <b>alignment</b> approach to recognition and illustrate it in two types of non-rigid objects: contour textures and elongated flexible objects. <b>Frame</b> <b>alignment</b> is based on matching stored models to images and has three stages: first, a "frame curve" and a corresponding object are computed in the image. Second, the object is brought into correspondence with the model by aligning the model axis with the object axis; if the object is not rigid it is "unbent" achieving a canonical description for recognition. Finally, object and model are matched against each other. Rigid and elongated flexible objects are matched using all contour information. Contour textures are matched using filter outputs around the frame curve. The central contribution of this thesis is Curved Inertia Frames (C. I.

After <b>frame</b> <b>alignment</b> the domains’ discourses move away from one another resulting in more variation between frames.

The condition is {{highly correlated with}} customer satisfaction {{that needs to be}} managed by service stakeholders. One of the efforts is to evaluate their service quality that can be represented by measuring quality of video that they stream to the customer. Peak Signal to Noise (PSNR) is a dominant method to measure video quality that has been widely used. However, PSNR concept cannot be used for video that streamed over wireless and mobile network. It is due to occurrence of packet loss that is inherent in the network and results to frame loss. To overcome this shortcoming, this research proposes an algorithm called <b>frame</b> <b>alignment</b> algorithm to locate frame loss position and do measurement on pair of corresponding frames between frame in reference video and frame in streamed video. This research also enhances the first algorithm accuracy by inserting adjacent frame to the frame loss position, frame insertion algorithm. Simulation of video stream has been conducted to generate video test material, and the proposed algorithms are used to measure quality of the video test material. Performance of the the proposed algorithms are evaluated by benchmarking the experiment result towards the conventional PSNR and the equivalent method, Modified-PSNR (MPSNR) based on Pearson product-Moment Correlation Coefficient (PMCC) value.
