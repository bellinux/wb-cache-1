5|$|Local people {{sometimes}} take pups for the exotic pet trade or as pets for themselves, but the animal rapidly grows to become unmanageable. Duplaix relates {{the story of}} an <b>Arawak</b> Indian who took two pups from their parents. While revealing of the affection held for the animals, the seizure was a profound blow to the breeding pair, which went on to lose their territory to competitors.|$|E
5|$|The {{areas of}} the world in which there is the {{greatest}} linguistic diversity, such as the Americas, Papua New Guinea, West Africa, and South-Asia, contain hundreds of small language families. These areas together account for the majority of the world's languages, though not the majority of speakers. In the Americas, some of the largest language families include the Quechumaran, <b>Arawak,</b> and Tupi-Guarani families of South America, the Uto-Aztecan, Oto-Manguean, and Mayan of Mesoamerica, and the Na-Dene, Iroquoian, and Algonquian language families of North America. In Australia, most indigenous languages belong to the Pama-Nyungan family, whereas New Guinea is home to a large number of small families and isolates, as well as a number of Austronesian languages.|$|E
50|$|Diseases, {{coupled with}} murder and slavery, took a large toll {{on both the}} <b>Arawaks</b> and the Caribs. Several groups of <b>Arawaks</b> {{committed}} mass suicide rather than submit to foreign rule. By the late 17th century, the <b>Arawaks</b> had been completely exterminated and few Caribs remained.|$|R
50|$|Whyaka is a {{thirteen}} square-mile Amerindian {{community where}} mostly <b>Arawaks</b> live. <b>Arawaks</b> {{were the first}} to inhabit the Mainstay area. They called it ‘Quacabuka’ meaning ‘in-between'.|$|R
50|$|The Huecoids are {{the oldest}} known civilizations to have {{occupied}} Marie-Galante, followed by <b>Arawaks,</b> {{and then by}} the Island Caribs circa 850. The island was called Aichi by the Caribs and Touloukaera by the <b>Arawaks.</b>|$|R
5|$|Queen conch shells {{were used}} by Native Americans and Caribbean Indians {{in a wide variety}} of ways. South Florida bands (such as the Tequesta), the Carib, the <b>Arawak</b> and Taíno used conch shells to {{fabricate}} tools (such as knives, axe heads and chisels), jewelry, cookware and used them as blowing horns. In Mesoamerican history, Aztecs used the shell as part of jewelry mosaics such as the double-headed serpent. The Aztecs also believed that the sound of trumpets made from queen conch shells represented divine manifestations, and used them in religious ceremonies. In central Mexico, during rain ceremonies dedicated to Tlaloc, the Maya used conch shells as hand protectors (in a manner similar to boxing gloves) during combat. Ancient middens of L. gigas shells bearing round holes are considered an evidence that pre-Columbian Lucayan Indians in the Bahamas used the queen conch as a food source.|$|E
25|$|The Taíno people, or Taíno culture, {{has been}} {{classified}} by some authorities {{as belonging to}} the <b>Arawak,</b> as their language was considered {{to belong to the}} <b>Arawak</b> language family, the languages of which were present throughout the Caribbean, and much of Central and South America.|$|E
25|$|Successive {{waves of}} <b>Arawak</b> migrants, moving northward from the Orinoco delta in South America, settled {{the islands of}} the Caribbean. Around AD 600, the Taíno Indians, an <b>Arawak</b> culture, arrived on the island, {{displacing}} the previous inhabitants. They were organized into cacicazgos (chiefdoms), each led by a cacique (chief).|$|E
5000|$|Ancient relics {{date the}} island's first settlers, {{probably}} Ciboney Indians (a subgroup of <b>Arawaks),</b> back to 3,500 years ago. Then {{another group of}} <b>Arawaks</b> migrated from South America's Orinoco basin around 800 A.D. Because of St. Martin's salt-pans they called it [...] "Soualiga," [...] or [...] "Land of Salt." [...] Mainly a farming and fishing society, the <b>Arawaks</b> lived in villages of straw-roofed buildings which were strong enough to resist hurricanes. Their tranquil civilization valued artistic and spiritual pursuits.|$|R
50|$|About 8 mi {{south-south-east}} is {{the village}} of Trois-Rivières, a fishing community rich in ancient settlements of the peaceful <b>Arawaks.</b> Near the village is an archaeological park which features sculpted and engraved rocks and relics left by the <b>Arawaks</b> in a grotto deep in the forest.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Arawaks</b> {{were the}} first {{well-documented}} group of Antiguans. They paddled to the island by canoe (piragua) from Venezuela, ejected by the Caribs—another people indigenous to the area. <b>Arawaks</b> introduced agriculture to Antigua and Barbuda, raising, among other crops, the famous Antiguan [...] "Black" [...] pineapple. They also cultivated various other foods including: ...|$|R

25|$|During {{the second}} voyage, Columbus {{sent a letter}} to the monarchs proposing to enslave some of the Americas' people, {{specifically}} from the Carib tribe, on the grounds of their independence-minded aggressiveness and their status as enemies of the Taíno tribe. Although his petition was refused by the Crown, in February 1495, Columbus disobeyed the Queen and took 1,600 people from the <b>Arawak</b> tribe who were then taken by the Carib as captives and slaves. No room was available for about 400 of the kidnapped <b>Arawak</b> leading to their release. The long term consequence for the Arawaks of contact with Europeans was eight million people almost entirely exterminated by torture, forced labour, despair, disease and other factors brought on by Christopher Columbus.|$|E
25|$|Tariana (also Tariano) is an {{endangered}} Maipurean (also known as <b>Arawak)</b> language spoken along the Vaupés River in Amazonas, Brazil by approximately 100 people.

50|$|The Spanish and Portuguese briefly claimed Barbados {{from the}} late 16th to the 17th centuries. The <b>Arawaks</b> are {{believed}} to have fled to neighbouring islands. Apart from possibly displacing the Caribs, the Spanish and Portuguese made little impact and left the island uninhabited. Some <b>Arawaks</b> migrated from British Guiana (modern-day Guyana) in the 19th century and continue to live in Barbados.|$|R
50|$|The Indigenous West Indians made {{excellent}} {{sea vessels}} {{that they used}} to sail the Atlantic and Caribbean. As a result, Caribs and <b>Arawaks</b> populated much of South American and the Caribbean Islands. Relatives of the Antiguan <b>Arawaks</b> and Caribs still live in various countries in South America, notably Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia. The smaller remaining native populations in the West Indies maintain a pride in their heritage.|$|R
25|$|Mestizos (mixed European-Indigenous) number about 34% of the population; unmixed Maya make {{up another}} 10.6% (Ketchi, Mopan, and Yucatec). The Garifuna, {{who came to}} Belize in the 19th century from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, have mixed African, Carib, and <b>Arawak</b> ancestry make up another 6% of the population.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of Europeans, the island- then called Iere- was {{inhabited}} by the indigenous <b>Arawak</b> people, and Carib people. The island's proximity to the continent makes it likely that it was among the first islands to be settled. The island probably was taken by three migration waves from the continent.|$|E
25|$|Wapishana is {{classified}} {{as a member of}} the <b>Arawak</b> language family. Wapishana is the only remaining Arawakan language in the circum-Roraima area. The term <b>Arawak</b> is more generally used to refer to the Arawakan or Lokono languages spoken in Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana and in some of the Antilles Islands. Most Brazilian Wapishana often speak Portuguese, instead of Wapishana and many Guyanese Wapishana speak English in addition to Wapishana. Portuguese is the dominant language among the Wapishana who live in urban areas that are bilingual in Portuguese and Wapishana, especially among the younger generations. According to Migliazza, more than 80% of Wapishana can speak the national language with which they are in contact, Portuguese in Brazil or English in Guyana. Since someone can cross the border between the two countries so easily, it is common to find people who speak Portuguese and English, as well as the maternal language.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Arawaks</b> {{attempted}} {{to fight back}} against Columbus's men but lacked their armor, guns, swords, and horses. When taken prisoner, they were hanged or burned to death. Desperation led to mass suicides and infanticide among the natives. In just two years under Columbus's governorship {{more than half of}} the 250,000 <b>Arawaks</b> in Haiti were dead. The main cause for the depopulation was disease followed by other causes such as warfare and harsh enslavement.|$|R
2500|$|Although Spanish {{settlement}} {{began in}} the 16th century, the census of 1777 recorded only 2,763 people as living on the island, including some 2,000 <b>Arawaks.</b>|$|R
25|$|Prior to this study, {{the first}} {{evidence}} of the disease in South America was found in remains of the <b>Arawak</b> culture around 1050 BC. The most significant finding belongs to the mummy of an 8 to 10-year-old Nascan child from Hacienda Agua Sala, dated to 700 AD. Scientists were able to isolate evidence of the bacillus.|$|E
25|$|The Garinagu (singular Garifuna), {{at around}} 4.5% of the population, are {{a mix of}} West/Central African, <b>Arawak,</b> and Island Carib ancestry. Though they were captives removed from their homelands, these people were never {{documented}} as slaves. The two prevailing theories are that, in 1635, they were either the survivors of two recorded shipwrecks or somehow took over the ship they came on.|$|E
25|$|In Cuba, the {{population}} of Amerindians includes 0.1 of {{the population}} and 0.2 part Native which is also part of the population. Many are from the Taíno people or <b>Arawak</b> people. When the Spanish Empire was in control of the island they used the Natives as slaves and many died from diseases, hence decreasing the population. Presently 0.3 of {{the population of}} Cuba consists of part Native and full-blooded Amerindians.|$|E

50|$|At Columbus' time, St. Martin was populated, if at all, by Carib amerindians. The former <b>Arawaks</b> {{had been}} chased by the Caribs {{coming from the}} North coast of South America a short time {{before the arrival of}} the Spaniards who {{followed}} in Columbus' wake. The <b>Arawaks</b> were agricultural people who fashioned pottery and whose social organization was headed by hereditary chieftains who derived their power from personal deities called zemis. The Caribs' territory was not completely conquered until the mid-17th century when most of them perished in the struggle between the French, English, Dutch, Danes and Spanish for control of the West Indies.|$|R
