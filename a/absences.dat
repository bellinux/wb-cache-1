40|$|Although it is {{commonly}} assumed that manager and team <b>absence</b> levels {{have a significant impact}} on an individuals’ <b>absence</b> level, research has yet to simultaneously test the effect of these sources, as well their interactive effect on employee <b>absence</b> behaviour. Using archival attendance records for 955 employees, grouped in 79 teams, and the <b>absence</b> records of their respective managers from a large professional services organization, this study considers <b>absence</b> behaviour through the lens and social learning theory and social information processing theory to suggest that <b>absence</b> norms are socially constructed based on social influences of the <b>absence</b> pattern of one 2 ̆ 7 s team and manager. Through the use of hierarchical linear modelling to account for group-level influences on <b>absence</b> behaviour, findings suggest that team-level <b>absence</b> exerts a greater influence on employee <b>absence</b> than manager <b>absence</b> and that manager <b>absence</b> exerts a moderating influence on this relationship. Implications for attendance management as well as future research are considered...|$|R

40|$|Typical and {{atypical}} seizures of <b>absence</b> epilepsy {{are thought}} to be generated by a rhythmogenic interplay between the cortex and the thalamus. However, the question remains as to which other subcortical and extrathalamic structures are involved in the pathophysiology of typical and atypical <b>absence</b> epilepsy. Limbic structures are not thought to be involved in typical <b>absence</b> seizures, since in animal models and human patients there is no evidence for the occurrence of spike-and-wave discharges of <b>absence</b> seizures in the limbic regions. However, {{there are a number of}} observations from animal models of <b>absence</b> epilepsy that point to a possibly important link between <b>absence</b> seizure mechanisms and limbic structures. Atypical <b>absence</b> seizures are distinct in many ways from typical <b>absence</b> seizures although they bear considerable clinical, EEG, and pharmacological resemblance to typical <b>absence</b> seizures. The differences between typical and atypical seizures of <b>absence</b> epilepsy appear to be circuitry dependent. While both typical and atypical <b>absence</b> seizures involve the cortico-thalamo-cortical circuitry, they each engage different neuronal networks within that circuitry. This review examines the involvement of limbic structures in typical and atypical <b>absence</b> seizures, shows that limbic circuitry forms an integral component of the <b>absence</b> epilepsy network and concludes that further knowledge of this component is important for understanding the complex relationships involved in <b>absence</b> epilepsy...|$|R

5|$|In several Western {{countries}} it {{has been}} seen that <b>absences</b> due to sickness for women are far greater than men. When investigating the reasons behind this, a study done in Sweden published in 1996 found {{that half of the}} difference between genders can be dismissed if you take out the days missed by pregnant women. When taking into account the health effects of double burden, child birth is always a possibility for mothers who already are faced with taking care of children and having a career and effects them and their health. In many studies people have tried to relate the difference in sickness <b>absences</b> directly to the double burden effect. It has been somewhat successful as women who are faced with work and child care have been known to request more sick days than men in the same situation. Additionally, working wives with children have twice the absence rate as men who are placed in the same position in work family conflicts.|$|E

40|$|Background Doctors {{have a low}} {{prevalence}} of sickness <b>absence.</b> Employment status is a determinant in the multifactorial background of sickness <b>absence.</b> The effect of doctors’ employment status on sickness <b>absence</b> is unexplored. The study compares the number of sickness <b>absence</b> days during the last 12  months {{and the impact of}} employment status, psychosocial work stress, self-rated health and demographics on sickness <b>absence</b> between self-employed practitioners and employed hospital doctors in Norway. Methods The study population consisted of a representative sample of 521 employed interns and consultants and 313 self-employed GPs and private practice specialists in Norway, who received postal questionnaires in 2010. The questionnaires contained items on sickness <b>absence</b> days during the last 12  months, employment status, demographics, self-rated health, professional autonomy and psychosocial work stress. Results 84 % (95 % CI 80 to 88 %) of self-employed and 60 % (95 % CI 55 to 64 %) of employed doctors reported no <b>absence</b> at all last year. In three multivariate logistic regression models with sickness <b>absence</b> as response variable, employment category was a highly significant predictor for <b>absence</b> vs. no <b>absence,</b> 1 to 3  days of <b>absence</b> vs. no <b>absence</b> and 4 to 99  days of <b>absence</b> vs. no <b>absence),</b> while in a model with 100 or more days of <b>absence</b> vs. no <b>absence,</b> {{there was no difference between}} employment categories, suggesting that serious chronic disease or injury is less dependent on employment category. Average or poor self-rated health and low professional autonomy, were also significant predictors of sickness <b>absence,</b> while psychosocial work stress, age and gender were not. Conclusion Self-employed GPs and private practice specialist reported lower sickness <b>absence</b> than employed hospital doctors.

40|$|Introduction Sickness <b>absence</b> has an {{important}} impact on employers (e. g. reduced productivity, high costs) and employees (e. g. replacement, job loss). Therefore, we investigated possible reduction by exploring avoidable sickness <b>absence.</b> Methods A questionnaire was filled out by 2, 954 Dutch workers (internet panel of a marketing research company, 2005). We obtained data on self reported sickness <b>absence</b> (6. 5 months), including {{the main reason for}} each sickness <b>absence</b> spell (4 health and 3 non-health reasons), self-reported work-relatedness of <b>absence</b> and workers' opinion on whether their <b>absence</b> could have been shorter or prevented, and on 12 listed factors that might have contributed to sickness <b>absence.</b> For each of these factors we calculated the avoidable <b>absence</b> fraction (AAF), analogous to the epidemiological population attributable risk. Results A total of 1, 233 workers reported sickness <b>absence.</b> The <b>absence</b> rate was 4. 46 %. For 11 % of the <b>absence</b> rate health was not the main reason. Yet, when non-health was reported as the main reason for <b>absence,</b> health still contributed in half the cases. 35 % of the <b>absence</b> rate was mainly work-related. 15 % of the workers mentioned that their sickness <b>absence</b> could have been shorter or prevented. The AAFs of contributory factors were 0. 129 for home related factors, 0. 136 for work-related factors and 0. 101 for (occupational) health care and guidance factors. In total, the AAF showed that 21. 5 % of the <b>absence</b> rate can be considered possibly avoidable. Conclusion According to the studied workers sickness <b>absence</b> rate can be reduced. In reducing the <b>absence,</b> one should not only consider factors from the home and work situation, but also from (occupational) health care. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, {{most studies}} on {{sickness}} <b>absence</b> within economics rely on data concerning general practitioner (GP)-certified or long-term sickness <b>absence,</b> as Nationwide registers often {{are available for}} GP-certified or long-term sickness <b>absence</b> (where the employee is eligible for sickness benefits). Register data is an objective and reliable data source, but does not include self-certified sickness <b>absence</b> nor information about attitudes. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to use actual sickness <b>absence</b> data as opposed to self-reported data, for both self-certified and GP-certified sickness <b>absence,</b> and to match this with data on individual attitudes. Our study therefore {{contributes to the literature}} on sickness <b>absence</b> by studying the relationship between attitudes and sickness <b>absence</b> empirically and by using objective, employer-registered data on both self-certified and GP-certified sickness <b>absence.</b> Our study includes attitudes towards possible reasons for sick leave, towards cheating and towards work.|$|R
40|$|Background Sickness <b>absence</b> due {{to illness}} is {{considered}} an indicator of work-related stress. Police work is a very stressful job. Sickness <b>absence</b> and sick leave are frequent among policemen. Methods We tested whether stress variables were predictors of absenteeism in a police unit specifically assigned {{to the maintenance of}} law and order. Results Control, Reward, and Support were negatively related to frequency of <b>absence</b> and short-term <b>absence.</b> Demand and Effort were positively related to total lost days. <b>Absence</b> recorded in the previous year was the best predictor of absenteeism. We also found a positive, albeit weak association between <b>absence</b> in the previous year and subsequent work-related stress. Conclusions Stress variables are associated with sickness <b>absence,</b> although the association is weak. Both short-term and prolonged sickness <b>absence</b> should be regarded as a warning sign for subsequent sickness <b>absence</b> and distress...|$|R

40|$|Background: Shift work {{research}} has shown that the relationship between exposure to irregular working times and sickness <b>absence</b> may differ between working populations. Not much is known about the prevalence of sickness <b>absence</b> in flight crews or about the relationship between exposure to different flight schedules and sickness <b>absence</b> in this population. Aims: To examine the association between cumulative exposure to different flight types and sickness <b>absence</b> in flight crew members. Methods: The study population consisted of flight crew members from a 5 year historic cohort. Flight schedule and sickness <b>absence</b> data were obtained from company records. The association between the cumulative exposure to different flight types and sickness <b>absence</b> episodes of > 7 days was determined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Adjusted models were obtained by adding potential confounders. Previous sickness <b>absence</b> was added to compose the fully adjusted models. Results: The records of 8228 employees were analysed. The fully adjusted univariate analyses showed that the numbers of medium-haul flights and flights with time zone crossings were associated with an increase in the odds for sickness <b>absence.</b> The fully adjusted multivariate analyses showed no significant associations between flight types and sickness <b>absence.</b> Conclusions: Cumulative exposure to flight types was not independently associated with sickness <b>absence</b> in flight crew members when previous sickness <b>absence</b> was taken into account. Because sickness <b>absence</b> in the past can predict future <b>absence,</b> preventive strategies targeted at flight crew members with a history of high sickness <b>absence</b> may be effective...|$|R

40|$|For {{many years}} Sweden has {{experienced}} {{high rates of}} sickness <b>absence</b> among employees. Sickness <b>absence</b> is often regarded {{as an indicator of}} health in a population, with low rates of <b>absence</b> associated with good health and high degrees of <b>absence</b> associated with poor health. The aim of the current paper is to examine this hypothesis, i. e. that the high rates of sickness <b>absence</b> in Sweden is an indicator of poor health. Sickness <b>absence</b> and health data was obtained from official government statistics in order to compare Sweden with six other European countries and a number of health-related variables. The hypothesis was not supported by the results of this study. While Sweden has a high rate of sickness <b>absence,</b> it ranks highly on a range of health variables when compared to other European countries. Instead, sickness <b>absence</b> may be more strongly associated with rates of unemployment. In times of high unemployment, sickness <b>absence</b> is low, and in times low unemployment, sickness <b>absence</b> is high. While public health programs are essential components of primary health care initiatives, the evidence from this study indicates that they are unlikely to have significant impact on sickness <b>absence</b> in Sweden. Instead more effort should be made to intervene early following sickness <b>absence</b> through providing timely vocational rehabilitation and disability management programs. Full Tex...|$|R
