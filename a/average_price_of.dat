In order to test this hypothesis, an analysis of time series of data of few selected commodities was undertaken. For this study,the data on arrivals and annual <b>average</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> six important commodities was under taken up. For the study, the data available in annual reports of Agricultural Produce Committee Pune, for the period of 10 years was used. First the data was subjected to Correlation analysis.

As well, the correlation between annual arrivals and previous year's <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> these six commodities also showed no correlation excepting that in Potato commodity. The positive and significant correlation in respect of Potato might be due to its high demand over the years.
