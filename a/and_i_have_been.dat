25|$|Vicki <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> sitting weeping {{into our}} coffees {{for the last}} couple of years. We have looked at all our hard work and thought: 'My God, what's happening?' This is not a place for show ponies, it's a time for {{carefully}} thought through strategic thinking.|$|E
25|$|You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in many battles, and we {{know there}} are always some mistakes. This time we were right because the enemy did what we {{expected}} him to do. Admiral Spruance could have been right. He's one of the finest officers I know of. It was his job to protect the landing force....|$|E

25|$|I {{grew up in}} an {{atmosphere}} of Sanskrit literature <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> dealing with the Sanskrit classics in and outside the classroom either as a student, or a teacher for the last sixty years. Naturally some of that cultural heritage cannot but appear even in a work on Christ. Moreover, I believe our task today is to underscore the similarities and the points in common between different cultures and religions rather than emphasise the differences.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the past}} six months, {{as chair of the}} Co-operative Commission, I have been hearing {{evidence}} from organisations and individuals {{with a wide range of}} views on the direction that the movement should take. My colleagues <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> impressed by many things: first and foremost, the goodwill towards the co-operative movement that is to be found in many, many places. There is also a willingness to embrace change and an awareness that no change is not an option.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} Napoleonic Wars and {{the long}} period of {{relative}} peace that followed caused a decline in both {{the number of new}} ships demanded by the navy and the number that needed to be repaired and maintained. Deptford's location and the shallow riverine waters exacerbated the problem as work and contracts were moved to other royal dockyards. The yard had its location close to the main navy offices in London in its favour, but the silting of the Thames and the trend towards larger warships made continued naval construction there an unappealing prospect. Engineer John Rennie commented of the yard that Ships-of-the-line which are built there cannot as I am informed with propriety be docked and coppered. Jury masts are put into them and they are taken to Woolwich, where they are docked, coppered and rigged, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> told of an instance where many weeks elapsed before a fair wind and tide capable of floating a large ship down to Woolwich occurred.|$|E

"America {{still has}} a {{constitutional}} protection of free speech, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> amazed... to see how few {{people in this country}} are willing to stick up for that elementary principle... a country once famous for free speech is now hysterically and expensively sensitive to anything that could be taken as a slight." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{loved the}} play; I saw its {{original}} production when I {{was a teenager}} so I really worked hard on it and tried to dispel any prejudices that might be there. I'm sensitive {{about the idea of}} a singer-turned-actress, it could give across the impression that a celebrity gets bored and goes [...] "hey, what'll I do" [...] and that's really not where I'm coming from, I'm very passionate about this <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> for a lot of years.|$|E
500|$|During the campaign, {{columnist}} Cal Thomas on Fox News labeled Michelle Obama as an [...] "Angry Black Woman" [...] {{and some}} web sites attempted to propagate this image, prompting her to respond: [...] "Barack <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{in the public}} eye for many years now, and we've developed a thick skin along the way.

500|$|Huntsman has {{repeatedly}} stated, [...] "We {{need to continue}} working closely with China to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program." [...] He has also named Taiwan, human rights, and Tibet among the [...] "areas where we have differences with China" [...] and vowed [...] "robust engagement" [...] on human rights if confirmed. The governor, who lived in Taiwan as a Mormon missionary, said he felt [...] "personally invested in the peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences, {{in a way that}} respects the wishes of the people on both Taiwan and the mainland. He said that current US policy [...] "supports this objective, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> encouraged by the recent relaxing of cross-strait tensions." [...] Huntsman is a supporter of Israel and has made several visits to Israel.|$|E
500|$|In March 2009, she praised President Barack Obama for {{reversing}} {{the ban on}} federally funded embryonic stem cell research. She traveled to Washington, D.C. in June 2009 to unveil a statue of her late husband in the Capitol rotunda. She was also on hand as President Obama signed the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission Act, and lunched privately with Michelle Obama. Reagan revealed {{in an interview with}} Vanity Fair that Michelle Obama had telephoned her for advice on living and entertaining in the White House. Following the death of Senator Ted Kennedy in August 2009, she said she was [...] "terribly saddened... Given our political differences, people are sometimes surprised how close Ronnie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> to the Kennedy family... I will miss him." [...] She attended the funeral of Betty Ford in Rancho Mirage, California, on July 12, 2011.|$|E
500|$|According to {{a report}} in Reuters, Goldstone said he had spent many days and [...] "sleepless nights" [...] {{deciding}} whether to accept the mandate, saying that it had come as [...] "quite a shock". He continued, [...] "I can approach the daunting task I have accepted in an even-handed and impartial manner and give it the same attention that I have to situations in my own country," [...] where his experience had been that [...] "transparent, public investigations are very important, important particularly for the victims because it brings acknowledgement of what happened to them." [...] He explained that he had long [...] "taken a deep interest in Israel, in what happens in Israel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> associated with organisations that have worked in Israel" [...] and [...] "decided to accept it because of my deep concern for peace in the Middle East, and my deep concern for victims in all sides in the Middle East." ...|$|E

500|$|On February4, Concord artist Philip Holden sent Beach {{improved}} sketches {{for both}} sides. Beach {{had been under}} the impression that the year must appear on the coin by itself, in addition to the anniversary dates 1775—1925; on February5 Keyes wrote to Beach that he had viewed the Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar and the Huguenot-Walloon half dollar. Both bore their dates only as part of anniversaries. Keyes noted that the two coins had the words [...] "PILGRIM" [...] and [...] "HUGUENOT" [...] respectively before [...] "HALF DOLLAR", and proposed that the word [...] "PATRIOT" [...] appear in the same place on the new coin. Keyes noted that April19, the anniversary of both battles, is Patriot Day in Massachusetts. He insisted that the words [...] "THE CONCORD MINUTE MAN" [...] appear even if it was illegible, [...] "the public in these two towns are sometimes pretty sensitive about petty matters and so Mr. Stone <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> very particular to come to an agreement as to all details." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{regards to}} {{presumptive}} 2016 GOP nominee Donald Trump, Cryer shared his feelings on the May 5, 2016, {{episode of the}} podcast Never Not Funny. Cryer stated, [...] "I have been pointing out, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> screaming to the rooftops, that Donald Trump is the Charlie Sheen of politics. [...] I have to tell you, I love Charlie Sheen, I loved working {{with him when he}} was sober, but he was, he's full of shit. He has been full of shit, you know, he has serious addiction. You know, his addiction is obviously serious, drugs, and, but, Trump is just addicted to feeling important. You know, and I think if anybody is under the delusion that he cares about, uh, uh, anybody in America besides himself, they are, they are stoned and need to rethink their priorities, 'cause he's, you know, 'cause it's just ridiculous that's he's gotten as far as he has." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Soul Sound" [...] {{was directed by}} Max & Dania and filmed in London. Band member Siobhán Donaghy stated that {{around the time of}} the video's filming, her and the other group members were not performing as a group frequently: [...] "It's been fairly quiet recently, but it usually is between singles. The other two have been doing their exams, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doing some interviews for newspapers and magazines abroad. Apart from the video for 'Soul Sound' we have not been doing too much together." [...] During the video, the group's members are featured in an apartment and are seated on couches and chairs. The plot involves their inner souls being released by the music, while outside in the neighbourhood the music takes control of other people's lives and causes their souls to be lifted too. The video was included on the CD release of [...] "Soul Sound".|$|E
6000|$|He {{resumed his}} cigar with defiance, {{and was about}} turning away when Staniford spoke.

500|$|Swift {{began work}} on her third studio album Speak Now two years prior to its release in 2010. [...] "Sparks Fly" [...] was written by Swift when she was sixteen years old, prior the release of her eponymous album in 2006. She {{performed}} the song live during several bar shows [...] "of forty and fifty people". A recorded live performance of the song during one of her concerts made its way onto the internet in 2007. The song became a favorite among Swift's fans, leading Swift to rework the song and include it on Speak Now after having so many requested {{for it to be}} included on the album. Of the song, Swift said that: [...] "This is a song I wrote a few years ago <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> working on it ever since. It's been awesome to see it change over the years. The fans have heard it before in concert, but there have been some really cool changes that I am very proud of and can't wait for them to hear." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 1943, Kesselring {{met with}} Hitler. Kesselring gave an optimistic {{assessment}} {{of the situation in}} Italy and gave reassurances that he could hold the Allies south of Rome on the Winter Line. Kesselring further promised that he could prevent the Allies reaching the Northern Apennines for at least six months. As a result, on 6 November 1943, Hitler ordered Rommel and his Army Group B headquarters to move to France to take charge of the Atlantic Wall and prepare for the Allied attack that was expected there in the spring of 1944. On 21 November 1943, Kesselring resumed command of all German forces in Italy, combining Commander-in-Chief South, a joint command, with that of Army Group C, a ground command. [...] "I had always blamed Kesselring", Hitler later explained, [...] "for looking at things too optimistically ... events have proved Rommel wrong, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> justified in my decision to leave Field Marshal Kesselring there, whom I have seen as an incredible political idealist, but also as a military optimist, and it is my opinion that military leadership without optimism is not possible." ...|$|E
500|$|On 16 December, Murphy {{announced}} the lineup of his Shadow Cabinet, which included posts {{for the two}} people who had stood against him in the leadership contest. Findlay {{was appointed to the}} Fair Work, Skills and Training portfolio, while Boyack became Shadow Minister for Rural Affairs, Food and Environment. Baillie was handed the post of Shadow Minister for Finance, Constitution and Economy, while Marra took on Health, Wellbeing and Sport.

It was also announced that Dugdale would speak for Labour at First Minister's Questions. Lamont did not have a place in the new cabinet, but Murphy stated that she had not wanted one: [...] "Johann <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in touch with one another; she has wished me well. I'm looking forward to getting together with her, but Johann wasn't looking for a job in today's reshuffle. I think Johann will be {{a big part of the}} Scottish Labour Party for years to come".|$|E
