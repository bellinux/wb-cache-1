5|$|Numerous {{sites in}} {{southern}} Africa reflect the four characteristics of behavioral modernity. Blombos Cave, South Africa contains personal ornaments {{and what are}} presumed to be the tools used {{for the production of}} artistic imagery, as well as bone tools. Still Bay and Howieson's Poort contain variable tool technologies. These different types of assemblages allow researchers to extrapolate behaviors that would likely be <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>such</b> technologies, such as shifts in foraging behaviors, which are further supported by faunal data at these sites.|$|E
5|$|When the {{reactivation}} {{of the s}} {{was under}} consideration, a radical design for a battleship-carrier hybrid emerged that would have replaced the ship's rear turret with a flight deck, complete with a hangar and two ski jumps, for operating several Harriers. However, the USMC considered the need for naval gunfire support to be a greater priority than additional platforms for carrier operations, while the cost and delay <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>such</b> elaborate conversions was significant, and the concept was dropped.|$|E
5|$|In November 1793, Shelby {{received}} a letter from another of Genêt's agents, Charles Delpeau. He confided to Shelby that he had been sent to secure supplies for an expedition against Spanish holdings, and inquired whether Shelby had been instructed to arrest individuals <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>such</b> a scheme. Three days later Shelby responded by letter, relating Jefferson's warning against aiding the French. Despite having no evidence that Shelby was party to Genêt's scheme, both Jefferson and Knox felt compelled to warn him a second time. Jefferson provided names and descriptions of the French agents believed to be in Kentucky and encouraged their arrest. Knox went a step further by suggesting Kentucky would be reimbursed for any costs incurred resisting the French by force, should such action become necessary. General Anthony Wayne informed him that his cavalry was at the state's disposal. Arthur St. Clair, governor of the American Northwest Territory, also admonished Shelby against cooperation with Genêt.|$|E

5|$|Quite often {{milestone}} {{home runs}} such as round hundred and career records are considered breaking news, and sports news services give coverage to countdowns on impending milestone home runs. Several of Bonds' milestone home runs were given dedicated coverage on ESPN BottomLine, with Chasing Ruth and Chasing Aaron coverage being quite extensive {{for the few}} seasons preceding {{the breaking of the}} record. Sports collectible dealers and buyers pay exorbitant sums for paraphernalia <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>such</b> milestones. The Baseball Hall of Fame covets such paraphernalia for display. In fact, players are even sensitive {{to the way in which}} their paraphernalia is displayed. A baseball that was hit for a milestone causes such a mêlée and such hysteria that special balls have to be used to stop counterfeiting, and police escorts are necessary for those who catch such balls.|$|E
5|$|The Andean Volcanic Belt {{consists}} of three main volcanic zones: the Northern Volcanic Zone (from 2° N to 5° S), the Central Volcanic Zone (16° to 28° S) and the Southern Volcanic Zone (33° to 46° S). Active volcanism occurs where the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South American Plate. The plates are separated by shallower subduction zones, with no present-day volcanism. These shallower zones {{have been attributed to}} the high speed of the plate collision, the young age of the subducting oceanic lithosphere and the curvature of the subducting plate. The most plausible theory is that variations in buoyancy of a subducting plate creates a flat subduction zone. The Cocos, Juan Fernandez and Nazca Ridges are <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>such</b> volcanic gaps where they collide with the oceanic trench. The subduction of spreading ridges can also diminish volcanism, as observed in the Chile Rise further south. The buoyancy of these crustal structures may hinder subduction, reducing water supply to the mantle and inducing the formation of melts.|$|E

25|$|Loss-of-{{function}} mutations, {{also called}} inactivating mutations, {{result in the}} gene product having less or no function (being partially or wholly inactivated).

Phenotypes <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>such</b> mutations are most often recessive. Exceptions are when the organism is haploid, or when the reduced dosage of a normal gene product {{is not enough for}} a normal phenotype (this is called haploinsufficiency).|$|E
