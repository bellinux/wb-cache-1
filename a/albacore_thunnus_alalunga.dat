5000|$|The <b>albacore</b> (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>alalunga),</b> known also as the longfin tuna, is {{a species}} of tuna of the order Perciformes. It is found in {{temperate}} and tropical waters across the globe in the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones. There are six distinct stocks known globally in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, {{as well as the}} Mediterranean Sea. The albacore has an elongate, [...] body with a conical snout, large eyes, and remarkably long pectoral fins. Its body is a deep blue dorsally and shades of silvery white ventrally. Individuals can reach up to 1.4 m in length.|$|E

Since the 1970s the SWFSC has {{collaborated with}} American Fishermen's Research Foundation (AFRF) in tagging studies of albacore. Through these studies {{we have learned}} that {{juvenile}} albacore (2 to years of age) make trans-Pacific migrations in their younger years between Japan and the West coast of North America. To date over 24,000 albacore have been tagged with conventional dart tags and 1,245 of these have been recovered.

50|$|The Strait of Messina is an {{important}} migratory route of the Mediterranean Sea. The best known and important, from an economic point of view, are the great pelagic fish - that is the Tuna (Thunnus thynnus), the <b>Albacore</b> (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>alalunga),</b> the Atlantic bonito (Sarda sarda), the Mediterranean Spearfish (Tetrapturus belone) and the Swordfish (Xiphias gladius). The fish of the Strait are captured with boats called feluche or small engine powered fishing boats called passerelle. These pelagic fish are assets unique {{to this part of}} the Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, only in the Strait, using various techniques, it is possible to capture Tuna throughout the year and in all age classes (from juveniles to adults) as the population moves between the Tyrrhenian and the Ionian Seas. The Strait of Messina is also an established route for the migration of Cetacea, and it is probably the most important in the Mediterranean Sea in terms of whale species diversity. Worthy of note, besides the several species of Dolphins are the Fin Whale (Balaenoptera physalus) and particularly the Sperm Whales which migrate to the Strait to their breeding area, probably the Aeolian Islands. Sharks also migrate through the Strait of Messina, including the Great White Shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the Bluntnose Sixgill Shark (Hexanchus griseus).|$|E
