5|$|Brooks {{supporters}} immediately {{claimed that}} the election had been dishonest. The Democrats, the Brindle Tails, and all non-Republican newspapers openly and vocally denounced the election as fraudulent, <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> Brooks had in fact received the most votes. The general citizenry of both parties, however, accepted the results. The Brooks supporters were in the minority in believing that the election had been fraudulent.|$|E
5|$|CAB {{inspectors}} had inspected {{units at}} a Teterboro, New Jersey, Bendix Corporation plant and discovered workers using tweezers to bind up bundles of wires, thereby damaging them. The Bendix Corporation issued denials, {{stating that the}} units underwent 61 inspections during manufacturing, in addition to inspections during installation and maintenance work, <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> had the insulation on the wires been breached at some point, it would have surely been detected and the unit replaced.|$|E
5|$|Kent {{attended}} St. Philip Catholic Central High School in Battle Creek, Michigan. He {{was recruited}} by the Boston Red Sox as a catcher right out of high school. Kent’s father thought that Kent {{was too young to}} play professional baseball <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> he go to St. Benedict’s College in Kansas. After graduating, Kent worked at a Veterans Administration Medical Center in his hometown of Battle Creek while being trained by Leapin’ Larry Chene for a professional wrestling career.|$|E

5|$|Roekiah {{insisted on}} {{becoming}} an actress, despite {{the opposition of}} her family, and asked her mother for permission to perform on stage. Ningsih agreed, with one condition: Roekiah could only perform once. When the seven-year-old Roekiah took to {{the stage for the}} first time, Mohammad Ali– unaware of the agreement between his wife and daughter– rushed on stage <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> Roekiah stop singing. Afterwards, she refused to eat until her parents ultimately relented. Roekiah performed regularly afterwards with the troupe.|$|E
5|$|At {{the back}} of Why Johnny Can't Read, Flesch had {{included}} 72 lists of words that young children {{should be able to}} read, and Spaulding provided Geisel with a similar list. Geisel later told biographers Judith and Neil Morgan that Spaulding had supplied him with a list of 348 words that every six-year-old should know <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the book's vocabulary be limited to 225 words. However, according to Philip Nel, Geisel gave varying numbers in interviews from 1964 to 1969. He variously claimed that he could use between 200 and 250 words from a list of between 300 and 400; the finished book contains 236 different words.|$|E
5|$|Before the final, both finalists {{were awarded}} 12,000 tickets. The Danish Football Association {{announced}} that 9,000 tickets would be offered, {{for sale to}} the public, while the remaining 3,000 were sold to other European countries. UEFA allocated another 3,000 tickets to their officials and VIP members. Problems ensued after {{it was revealed that}} Galatasaray had been charging the tickets more than the original price, in order to prevent some football hooligans from entering the ground. The Turkish club's secretary general however, denied this <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the tickets were being sold at their original price and to support the stadium and the club's other sporting activities.|$|E

5|$|Carrington and Johnson {{speculated that}} Leigh was {{assaulted}} {{by the group}} of boys after returning from the beach, as punishment for complaining about being raped, and was murdered by Webster and two others {{because they were afraid}} she would tell other people. They refused to specifically name the two other suspects for fear of legal repercussions, though clarified that one had sexually assaulted Leigh earlier in the night, and the other likely sexually assaulted her with a beer bottle before she died, as punishment for publicly refusing to have sex with him. Webster talked to the media about the murder {{for the first time in}} 1997, <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> he acted alone in killing Leigh.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, the Senate {{took up the}} {{question}} of ending the joint occupancy of the Oregon Territory with Great Britain. Lewis Cass, a senator from Michigan, supported an immediate termination of the joint occupation agreement and maintained that a war with the British over the matter was inevitable. Crittenden disagreed, <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> Britain be given two years notice before the joint occupation of the territory was ended {{in order to allow}} time for a diplomatic resolution. Ultimately, Crittenden's position prevailed, and a compromise with Britain was effected, setting the dividing line between the two nations' claims at the 49th parallel north.|$|E
5|$|In 1884 and 1885, {{through the}} {{influence}} of Archer, Shaw was engaged to write book and music criticism for London papers. When Archer resigned as art critic of The World in 1886 he secured the succession for Shaw. The two figures in the contemporary art world whose views Shaw most admired were William Morris and John Ruskin, and he sought to follow their precepts in his criticisms. Their emphasis on morality appealed to Shaw, who rejected the idea of art for art's sake, <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> all great art must be didactic.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, the {{new film}} studio Photo Chemical Laboratories, known as P.C.L. (which later became the major studio, Toho), advertised for {{assistant}} directors. Although he had demonstrated no previous interest in film as a profession, Kurosawa submitted the required essay, which asked applicants to discuss the fundamental deficiencies of Japanese films {{and find ways to}} overcome them. His half-mocking view was that if the deficiencies were fundamental, {{there was no way to}} correct them. Kurosawa's essay earned him a call to take the follow-up exams, and director Kajirō Yamamoto, who was among the examiners, took a liking to Kurosawa <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the studio hire him. The 25-year-old Kurosawa joined P.C.L. in February 1936.|$|E
5|$|In March 1383, Carrouges made a third {{effort to}} expand his family holdings, with the {{purchase}} of the neighbouring fiefs of Cuigny and Plainville from his neighbour Sir Jean de Vauloger. The sale required approval from Count Pierre, who was overlord of both fiefs, but as consequence of the previous legal difficulties Carrouges had caused him, Pierre refused to permit the sale <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> Carrouges turn the properties over to him in exchange for a full refund of the original price paid. Carrouges {{had no choice but to}} comply and subsequently blamed Jacques Le Gris' influence for this new misfortune.|$|E
5|$|Not {{yet ready}} to confront the United States directly, Tecumseh {{found that he was}} opposed by those Native American leaders who had signed the treaty. He {{threatened}} to kill anyone and their followers who carried out the terms of the treaty. Tecumseh began to travel widely, urging warriors to abandon the accommodationist chiefs and to join his resistance at Prophetstown. Tecumseh insisted that the Fort Wayne treaty was illegitimate. In an 1810 meeting with Governor Harrison, he demanded that Harrison nullify the treaty and warned that settlers should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Harrison rejected his demands <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the tribes could have individual relations with the United States.|$|E

5|$|On March 3, 1993, Saint Joseph Academy {{high school}} senior Joey Fischer was shot dead outside his home in Rancho Viejo, an upscale {{community}} north of Brownsville, Texas. Dora Cisneros, {{the mother of his}} ex-girlfriend, was responsible for orchestrating Fischer's murder after he broke up with her daughter Cristina. Fischer and Cristina had broken up the previous summer, but Cisneros became obsessed with their relationship <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> Fischer date her daughter again. After he refused a US$500 offer from Cisneros, she consulted María Mercedes Martínez, a fortune teller, to cast a spell on him.|$|E
5|$|Relations between Henry, Matilda, and Geoffrey became {{increasingly}} strained during the King's final years. Matilda and Geoffrey suspected that they lacked genuine support in England. In 1135 they urged Henry {{to hand over}} the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda whilst he was still alive, <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the Norman nobility swear immediate allegiance to her, thereby giving the couple a more powerful position after Henry's death. Henry angrily declined to do so, probably out of concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy. A fresh rebellion broke out amongst the barons in southern Normandy, led by William, the Count of Ponthieu, whereupon Geoffrey and Matilda intervened in support of the rebels.|$|E
5|$|The {{day before}} Jamila's execution, Ibrahim meets with Susi, who tells him about Jamila's romantic {{involvement}} with Nurdin. Jamila became pregnant with Nurdin's child <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> he take responsibility, but instead Nurdin {{told her he}} was marrying someone else and humiliated her in public. When the two met in a hotel, Nurdin threatened Jamila with a pistol; in self-defence, Jamila killed him with the pistol. In the modern day, Jamila walks towards her execution; the president has not responded to the request for stay. The screen fades to black as a gunshot goes off, and afterwards, statistics about child trafficking and prostitution are shown.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Ralph d'Escures in October 1122, King Henry I decided to allow a free election, with the new primate to be chosen by the leading men of the realm, both ecclesiastical and secular. The monks of the cathedral chapter and the bishops of the kingdom {{disagreed}} on who should be appointed. The bishops insisted {{that it should not}} be a clerk (a non-monastic member of the clergy), but Canterbury's monastic cathedral chapter preferred a monk, <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> they alone had the right to elect the archbishop. However, only two bishops in England or Normandy were monks (Ernulf, Bishop of Rochester, and Serlo, Bishop of Séez), and no monks other than Anselm of Canterbury, Ernulf, and Ralph d'Escures, had been elected to an English or Norman see since 1091; recent precedent therefore favoured a clerk. King Henry sided with the bishops, and told the monks that they could elect their choice from a short list selected by the bishops. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the list contained no monks.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Shoulder Arms, Chaplin {{requested}} more money from First National, which was refused. Frustrated with their lack of concern for quality, and worried about rumours of a possible merger between the company and Famous Players-Lasky, Chaplin joined forces with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and D. W. Griffith {{to form a new}} distribution company – United Artists, established in January 1919. The arrangement was revolutionary in the film industry, as it enabled the four partners – all creative artists – to personally fund their pictures and have complete control. Chaplin was eager to start with the new company and offered to buy out his contract with First National. They declined this <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> he complete the final six films he owed them.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} media, {{newspapers}} were {{controlled by the}} state, with the Reich Press Chamber shutting down or buying newspapers and publishing houses. By 1939, over {{two thirds of the}} newspapers and magazines were directly owned by the Propaganda Ministry. The NSDAP daily newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter ("Ethnic Observer"), was edited by Alfred Rosenberg, author of The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a book of racial theories espousing Nordic superiority. Goebbels controlled the wire services <b>and</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> all newspapers in Germany only publish content favourable to the regime. His propaganda ministry issued two dozen directives every week on exactly what news should be published and what angles to use; the typical newspaper followed the directives closely. Newspaper readership plummeted, partly because of the decreased quality of the content and partly because of the surge in popularity of radio.|$|E
