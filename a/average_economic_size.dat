40|$|In {{the paper}} will be {{emphasized}} the importance of the other profitable activities (OPA) on the family agricultural holdings, according to their economic size within the territory of Republic of Serbia, with special focus on the Vojvodina Region. Economic size of the agricultural holding is recognized by the value of its total standard output (SA). Other profitable activities related to the agricultural holdings include incomes from agricultural products sale, rural tourism, fishery, etc., whether they are performed on or outside the holding. Other profitable activities that are not related to agricultural holdings include activities that do not consume resources of the holding, but only the labor, as like in previous case they may be carried on, or outside the holding. According to gained results, <b>average</b> <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> of the holding in the Republic of Serbia is 5. 939 EUR, while the realized economic value on the family agricultural holdings (FAH) is 4. 990 EUR. Census of Agriculture in 2012 showed that the highest <b>average</b> <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> of the agricultural holdings has a Vojvodina Region (12. 032 EUR), what is 3, 5 times higher than the value achieved in other regions. From the total sum of 631. 552 agricultural holdings in the Republic of Serbia (family agricultural holdings (FAH), as well as legal entities (LE) and entrepreneurs) only 78. 301 holdings possess DPA that are in relation to the holding (where 21 % of them are within the economic class in range of 4. 000 - 7. 000 EUR). At the level of the Vojvodina Region, in total there were registered 147. 624 agricultural holdings (AH), where 8. 405 of them have OPA in relation to the holding (13, 6 % are within the class of economic sizes 100. 000 and more EUR) ...|$|E

To accomplish its goals, the study use stepwise regression analysis for independent variables which determined the <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> for the agricultural sector in Saudi Arabia for the period 1980 - 2001. The results of this study show that: Instead of the reduction in the investment values directed to the agricultural sector, and its share of labor, the <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> of agricultural sector increased from 1 % in 1980 to 5. 11 % in 2001. So, this sector participate in diversifying the Saudi economy.

The finding revealed that, in average, working-age population aged 50 – 59 years old in Thailand had moderate economic preparation for retirement. Moreover, the findings also revealed that age, income, income sufficiency, year of schooling and health condition had the positive influences on {{the opportunity to have}} above <b>average</b> <b>economic</b> preparation for retirement.

In addition, those who lived as a head of household or a spouse of a head of household had the highest opportunity to have above <b>average</b> <b>economic</b> preparation for retirement.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{micro-economic}} data of the Hungarian FADN system we analysed the role of subsidies in the profitability of farms, we aimed to reveal which types of farming and <b>economic</b> <b>sizes</b> are effected more by subsidies related to efficiency and profitability. The agricultural enterprises' balance of taxes and subsidies counted from the micro-economic data of FADN enterprises was also analysed in the different type of farming categories and <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> classes. Our aim was to find out what types of farms are subsidized and what types are net payers to the central budget. Examining the pre-tax profit we made the conclusion that with the increase of <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> not only the proportion of profitable farms rises, but the profit per size unit increases and the loss decreases. Analysing the effect of production based subsidies and interest subsidies on the pre-tax profit we made the conclusion that the sum of subsidies received from government per size unit is almost equal in all <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> classes. agricultural subsidies, profitability, payments of agricultural enterprises, FADN, Agricultural Finance, Q 12,...|$|R

The analysed family farms of the area ranging from 8. 58 ha UAA to 150 ha UAA had <b>economic</b> <b>sizes</b> ranging from € 9, 737 to € 24, 9379.

It was stated that with an economic increase of the <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> developmental possibilities increase which is indicated by positive average correlation between these variables. In the best situation, regarding developmental possibilities are large farms having 12 times more possibilities than small farms.

The paper also {{demonstrates that}} within that framework, the lower the trade barriers towards non-member countries, the greater the <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> that may be required for preferential trade agreements to be welfare improving.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is the {{empirical}} measurement and analysis of <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> and performance of dispersed and clustered small-scale enterprises (SSEs) in India. Design/methodology/approach – Methodology is descriptive and comparative, using a combination of different official databases. <b>Economic</b> <b>size</b> is measured by distribution of SSEs by employment, output, fixed capital investment, and export variables. Measurement of economic performance is focused on output/capital ratio, output/labour ratio, and labour/capital ratio. Findings – The results offer evidence for economic diversity in the size compositions and performance variations of dispersed and clustered SSEs; and bigger <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> and higher <b>economic</b> performance of clustered than dispersed SSEs. Research limitations/implications – Subject to the comparability of economic structure, the results and implications for India are of relevance for promotion and development of clustered SSEs in other developing countries. Practical implications – From the viewpoint of policy formulation, the results offer a strong empirical basis for a cluster approach rather than a dispersed approach for promotion and development of SSEs in India. The cluster approach has implications for establishing linkages between formal and informal SSEs and for elimination of smallness of dispersed SSEs. Originality/value – The paper provides a comparative analysis of <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> and performance of the dispersed and clustered SSEs by consolidating the diverse databases in India.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is defining the influence of agricultural land area (AL) and <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> on energy inputs in family farms that are beneficiaries of European Union funding. 70 farms of Biłgoraj County that were beneficiaries of EU funding for technical modernization were researched within 2004 - 2009. In order to define energy inputs, the group of farms that were {{the object of the}} research were divided according to the amount of subsidy, area of agricultural land, <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> (ESU) and the income of an enterprise. In the process of characterizing the researched farms according to the level of possessed energy means, tractors, self-propelled combine harvesters and electric engines used in the process of farm produc-tion were taken into account, including also the ones mounted in the equipment operated in the farms. The level of energy inputs in the researched farms calculated into area unit was decreasing system-atically, both when the amount of funding increased, as well as area, eco-nomic size and income of an enterprise. In the group of farms according to the <b>economic</b> <b>size,</b> when its size increased, energy inputs decreased, and the tendency remained the same in farms of the highest income of an enterprise. In farms of a small area (up to 10 ha) of agricultural land (AL), apart from high level of specific labour input, there were high inputs of manual labour.
