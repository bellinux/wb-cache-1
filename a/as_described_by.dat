5|$|A tornado is not {{necessarily}} visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (<b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> Bernoulli's principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause water vapor {{in the air to}} condense into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling. This results in the formation of a visible funnel cloud or condensation funnel.|$|E

5|$|Observations, {{including}} the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), and Planck {{maps of the}} CMB, suggest that the Universe is infinite in extent with a finite age, <b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) models. These FLRW models thus support inflationary models and the standard model of cosmology, describing a flat, homogeneous universe presently dominated by dark matter and dark energy.|$|E
5|$|Olivia had six novels {{published}} between 1894 and 1910, which <b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> Foster {{are about}} women unhappy in love, with insipid and uninspiring male characters.

The scenes at Bly were filmed at Brympton d'Evercy, a manor house near Yeovil, Somerset.

5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in the scientific literature in 1796 by mycologist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. synonyms include Lycoperdon gemmatum (<b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> August Batsch in 1783); the variety Lycoperdon gemmatum var. perlatum (published by Elias Magnus Fries in 1829); Lycoperdon bonordenii (George Edward Massee, 1887); and Lycoperdon perlatum var. bonordenii (A.C.

5|$|As a {{rotating}} proto-stellar disk contracts {{to form a}} star its shape {{becomes more and more}} spherical, but the contraction doesn't proceed all the way to a perfect sphere. At the poles all of the gravity acts to increase the contraction, but at the equator the effective gravity is diminished by the centrifugal force. The final shape of the star after star formation is an equilibrium shape, {{in the sense that the}} effective gravity in the equatorial region (being diminished) cannot pull the star to a more spherical shape. The rotation also gives rise to gravity darkening at the equator, <b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> the von Zeipel theorem.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> quantum chromodynamics, {{the strong}} {{interaction}} between quarks is mediated by gluons, massless vector gauge bosons. Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor charge. In the standard framework of particle interactions (part {{of a more}} general formulation known as perturbation theory), gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a virtual emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red quark emits a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes green, and if a green quark absorbs a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, their strong interaction is preserved.|$|E

5|$|Epaminondas evidently began {{serving as}} a soldier after adolescence; Plutarch refers to an {{incident}} involving Epaminondas that occurred during a battle at Mantinea. Though not explicitly stated, this was probably the Spartan attack on Mantinea in 385 BC, <b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> Xenophon; Plutarch tells us that Epaminondas was there {{as part of a}} Theban force aiding the Spartans, so this battle fits the description.* Hanson, Hoplites, 146; Stylianoy, Diodorus Siculus, 172. However, Buck (Boiotia, 63) questions the existence of a SpartanTheban alliance in 385 BC. Epaminondas was certainly not old enough to have served at the First Battle of Mantinea which was in 418 BC.|$|E
5|$|If {{the mass}} of the nucleus {{following}} a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a gamma ray, or the kinetic energy of a beta particle), <b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> Albert Einstein's mass–energy equivalence formula, E=mc2, where m is the mass loss and c is the speed of light. This deficit is part of the binding energy of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate.|$|E
5|$|In 1877 three {{stones were}} found in a cavern on Rodrigues, each near a Rodrigues {{solitaire}} skeleton, and were inferred to be the gizzard stones mentioned by Leguat. One of the stones was examined and found to be dolerite: somewhat rough, hard and heavy, , but hardly flat on one side <b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> Leguat. This {{could be due to}} its association with a young individual. Although Leguat asserted that the bird hatched with the gizzard stone already inside, in reality adults most likely fed the stones to their hatchlings.|$|E

The 40th Anniversary Edition of The Exorcist {{will have a}} touch of new material in {{it as part of}} an all-around polish of the dialogue and prose. First time around I never had the time (meaning the funds) to do a second draft, and this, finally, is it. With forty years to think about it, a few little changes were inevitable – plus one new character in a totally new very spooky scene. This is the version I would like to be remembered for. Tor/Forge have also re-published The Ninth Configuration and Legion, with new, updated cover artwork.|$|E
5|$|Instead, more {{abundant}} remains from Asia have provided more data. Initial remains were not promising; a partial fragmentary ischium from Heilongjiang, China, that Riabinin named S. kryschtofovici. Much better remains were soon recovered, though, but from Mongolia's early Maastrichtian-age Nemegt Formation. The 1946–1949 Russian-Mongolian paleontological expeditions recovered the large skeleton that became S. angustirostris <b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> Anatoly Rozhdestvensky. Other skeletons {{from a variety}} of growth stages have also been discovered, and S. angustirostris is now the most abundant Asian hadrosaurid.|$|E
