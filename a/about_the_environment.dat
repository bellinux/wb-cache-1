25|$|Areas of {{artificial}} intelligence deal with autonomous planning or deliberation for robotical systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed {{understanding of these}} environments is required to navigate through them. Information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> {{could be provided by}} a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing high-level information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> and the robot.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanical}} {{structure of}} a robot must be controlled to perform tasks. The control of a robot involves three distinct phases – perception, processing, and action (robotic paradigms). Sensors give information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> or the robot itself (e.g. the position of its joints or its end effector). This information is then processed to be stored or transmitted and to calculate the appropriate signals to the actuators (motors) which move the mechanical.|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, {{questions}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> {{have become}} increasingly politicized, with the Left generally accepting the findings of environmental scientists about global warming and many on the Right disputing or rejecting those findings. However, the left is divided over how to effectively and equitably reduce carbon emissions: the center-left often advocates a reliance on market measures such as emissions trading or a carbon tax, while those further to the left tend to support direct government regulation and intervention either alongside or instead of market mechanisms.|$|E

25|$|Richard Upjohn {{built the}} house in the Greek Revival {{architectural}} style for William Rotch Jr. in 1834, on a New Bedford plot Rotch had inherited from his father. It was Upjohn's first house, near the beginning of a long career. Rotch also commissioned a garden in the rear, which later owners would significantly expand. The property remained private until 1981, when it was bought by local preservationists and reopened as a historic house museum. It was declared a National Historic Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Today the museum educates visitors not only about whaling but, through its gardens and associated programs for local schools, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> as well.|$|E
25|$|From an {{evolutionary}} perspective, {{it has been}} hypothesized that the executive system may have evolved to serve several adaptive purposes. The prefrontal lobe in humans has been associated both with metacognitive executive functions and emotional executive functions. Theory and evidence suggest that the frontal lobes in other primates also mediate and regulate emotion, but do not demonstrate the metacognitive abilities that are demonstrated in humans. This uniqueness of the executive system to humans implies that there was also something unique <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> of ancestral humans, which {{gave rise to the}} need for executive functions as adaptations to that environment. Some examples of possible adaptive problems that would have been solved by the evolution of an executive system are: social exchange, imitation and observational learning, enhanced pedagogical understanding, tool construction and use, and effective communication.|$|E
25|$|A {{frequent}} {{critique of}} the discipline is that the hypotheses of evolutionary psychology are frequently arbitrary and difficult or impossible to adequately test, thus questioning its status as an actual scientific discipline, for example because many current traits probably evolved to serve different functions than they do now. While evolutionary psychology hypotheses are difficult to test, evolutionary psychologists assert {{that it is not}} impossible. Part of the {{critique of the}} scientific base of evolutionary psychology includes a critique of the concept of the Environments of Evolutionary Adaptation. Some critics have argued that researchers know so little <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> in which Homo sapiens evolved that explaining specific traits as an adaption to that environment becomes highly speculative. Evolutionary psychologists respond that they do know many things about this environment, including the facts that present day humans' ancestors were hunter-gatherers, that they generally lived in small tribes, etc.|$|E

25|$|Left 4 Dead {{uses the}} 2008 version of Valve's Source engine, with {{improvements}} such as multi-core processor support and physics-based animation to more realistically portray hair and clothing, {{and to improve}} physics interaction with enemies when shot or shoved in different body parts. Animation was also improved to allow characters to lean realistically when moving in curved paths. Rendering and artificial intelligence were scaled up {{to allow for a}} greater number of enemies who can navigate the world in better ways, such as climbing, jumping, or breaking obstacles. Lighting was enhanced with new self-shadowing normal mapping and advanced shadow rendering that is important to convey information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> and player actions. Wet surfaces and fog are used to create mood. Many kinds of post processing cinematic visual effects inspired by horror movies {{have been added to the}} game. There is dynamic color correction that accentuates details based on importance, contrast and sharpening to focus attention on critical areas, film grain to expose details or imply details in dark areas and vignetting to evoke tension and a horror-film look.|$|E

For Pemberton, the device works because the character has been moved from a safe environment into the unknown.
