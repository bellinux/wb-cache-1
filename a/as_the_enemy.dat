5|$|David Gilbertson, {{a former}} {{assistant}} inspector {{who had worked for}} the Home Office formulating policing policy, told The New York Times that the British police used to act with the sanction of the public, but that tactics had changed after a series of violent assaults on officers in the 1990s. Now dressing in military-style uniforms and equipped with anti-stab vests, extendable metal batons and clubs that turn into handcuffs, an entire generation of officers has come to regard the public <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy,</b> the newspaper said.|$|E

The advance of the Anzac Mounted Division began at daylight, but soon afterwards, forward patrols reported that the garrison at Bir el Abd was retiring. The mounted force followed the Austrians, Germans and Ottomans as far as Salmana, where another rearguard action delayed the mounted force, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> withdrawal continued back to El Arish.|$|E

5000|$|Sensing the situation, Sultan Mehmed VI charged his {{minister}} of war, Şevket Süleyman Pasha, {{with the establishment}} of an irregular force to exterminate the nationalists. Realizing he could no longer count on the title [...] "Sultan" [...] alone to influence the Turkish people, he considered it necessary to use the timeless and spiritual title of [...] "Caliph" [...] for the leader of the army - thus depicting Nationalists not only <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> of <b>the</b> Sultanate but also <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> of God. <b>The</b> British supported the Kuvâ-i İnzibâtiyye with the aim of enforcing British policy in the region and of stabilizing the remnants of the Ottoman Empire. Supported by the British, the Sultan began a propaganda war throughout the country. Relayed by Hoxha and priests, he urged the Turks to take up arms against the Nationalists of General Kemal, presented <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemies</b> of God.|$|R
5|$|The {{orders from}} General der Artillerie (Lieutenant General) Paul Bader, the German Military Commander in Serbia, {{directed}} that Operation Southeast Croatia {{was to be}} an encirclement operation. All persons encountered within the area of operations were to be treated <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> The population within the area to be targeted by the operation were almost all either Orthodox Serbs or Bosnian Muslims, {{although there was a}} small Catholic Croat minority. Bader believed that the Partisans and Chetniks were using the area as winter quarters, and that their presence there was a threat to major transport routes through eastern Bosnia.|$|E
5|$|Marshal Augereau's arrival from Brest {{with the}} newly formed VII Corps gave the French one more piece of good news. In the Capitulation of Dornbirn on 13 November, Franjo Jelačić's {{division}} was cornered and forced to surrender. The Russians withdrew to the northeast after Mack's capitulation and Vienna fell on 12 November. The Allies were thoroughly defeated at the Battle of Austerlitz in December and Austria was permanently knocked out of the Third Coalition a few weeks later. The French victory highlighted the effectiveness of la manoeuvre sur les derrières, a special type of strategic envelopment first used by Napoleon in his Italian campaign in 1796. The maneuver called for a pinning force that would occupy a broad front of the enemy line while other supporting units positioned themselves at a specific location in the enemy's flank or rear. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> became more embroiled with the pinning force, the flanking troops would attack at a critical spot and seal the victory. In the Ulm Campaign, Murat's cavalry served as the pinning force that fooled the Austrians into thinking the main French attack would come from the Black Forest. As Murat lulled the Austrians towards Ulm, the main French forces crashed through Central Germany and separated Mack's army from the other theaters of the war.|$|E
5|$|On 23 April 1917, Ball {{was under}} strict orders to stay over British lines, but still engaged the Germans {{five times in}} his Nieuport. In his first combat that day, using his {{preferred}} belly shot, he sent an Albatros into a spin, following it down and continuing to fire at it until it struck the ground. It was No.56 Squadron's first victory. Regaining an altitude of , he tried to dive underneath an Albatros two-seater and pop up under its belly as usual, but he overshot, and the German rear gunner put a burst of 15 bullets through the Nieuport's wings and spars. Ball coaxed the Nieuport home for repairs, returning to battle in an S.E.5. In his third combat of the day, he fired five rounds before his machine gun jammed. After landing to clear the gun, he took off once more, surprising five Albatros fighters and sending one down in flames. His fifth battle, shortly thereafter, appeared inconclusive, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> plane managed to land safely. However, its observer had been mortally wounded.|$|E

5|$|Nine {{days later}} Braham {{returned}} to Denmark. On this occasion a No. 305 Squadron RAF Mosquito was {{borrowed from the}} Polish. On the mission he encountered a He 111 near Esjberg. It was circling a lighthouse at 300 feet. Braham fired a three-second fusillade of fire. The He 111 caught fire and nose-dived into the sea, exploding on impact. A Focke-Wulf Fw 58 trainer followed as his second victory on this mission. Meanwhile, the Germans had tracked the Mosquito by radar. Two Messerschmitt Bf 109s {{appeared on the scene}} soon afterwards. The cloud base was only at 1,000 feet and he effected his escape by hiding in its folds. One of the Bf 109s fired some ineffectual bursts of fire at Braham and he also encountered some light ground fire. He few directly to Group HQ at Benson. He returned the Mosquito the following day. Some days later, Braham returned to 305 to pick up a Mosquito and joined No. 107 Squadron RAF in a raid against Paris even though he had no formal bomber pilot training. Nine days later near Poitiers, Braham was engaged in a ground attack mission. He spotted a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 carrying a drop tank and under-wing rockets at low-level. He fired at 600 yards <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> accelerated to escape. His fire slowed the Fw 190; catching up with it, the Fw 190 was hit again and crashed: its wreckage strewn over three fields. The Focke-Wulf was his 27th victory.|$|E
5|$|With a {{large portion}} of his fleet no longer battleworthy, Howe was unable to resume his search for the French convoy in the Bay of Biscay. The Admiralty, though unaware of Howe's {{specific}} circumstances, knew a battle had taken place through the arrival of HMS Audacious in Portsmouth, and was preparing a second expedition under George Montagu. Montagu had returned to England after his unsuccessful May cruise, and was refitting in Portsmouth when ordered to sea again. His force of ten ships was intended to both cover Howe's withdrawal from Biscay, and find and attack the French grain convoy. Montagu returned to sea on 3 June, and by 8 June was off Ushant searching for signs of either the French or Howe; unknown to him, neither had yet entered European waters. At 15:30 on 8 June Montagu spotted sails, and soon identified them <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> He had located Cornic's squadron, which was also patrolling for the convoy and the returning fleets. Montagu gave chase and drove Cornic into Bertheaume Bay, where he blockaded the French squadron overnight, hoping to bring them to action the following day. However, on 9 June, Montagu sighted 19 French ships appearing from the west—the remnants of Villaret's fleet. Hastily turning his ships, Montagu sailed south to avoid becoming trapped between two forces which might easily overwhelm him. Villaret and Cornic gave chase for a day before turning east towards the safety of the French ports.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{campaign}}— The Japanese campaign {{focuses on}} the unification of Japan, the beginning of which was also a scenario in , {{the establishment of the}} Tokugawa Shogunate, which players control, and a young general named Sakuma Kichiro. Apparently, when Kichiro was a baby, Tokugawa Ieyasu rescued him from the ruins of his conquered village and raised him as his adopted son. The campaign begins when Kichiro meets up with Daimyo Torii Mototada, who also narrates this campaign, at the siege of Osaka (transported from 1598 to 1615) to capture the 5-year-old heir of Hideyoshi. Kichiro and Mototada ally with the local villagers and storm the castle. Next, they move to the north-east of Honshu to destroy any villages that might support Tokugawa's enemy, Uesugi Kagekatsu and defeat Uesugi's army. After the victory, in which they suffer heavy losses, Mototada learns that Tokugawa's main enemy, Ishida Mitsunari is threatening Mototada's estate at Fushimi, forcing Mototada to return there. Meanwhile, Kichiro marches his exhausted army west again {{to take control of the}} Tokaido Road trade route. In the aftermath of the battle there, a defeated samurai of the Oda clan tells Kichiro that Tokugawa has lied to him since his childhood. Angered, Kichiro kills the samurai, but nevertheless, is still shaken by his words. He returns to Mototada at Fushimi, and asks him the truth of his origins. Mototada tells Kichiro that it was Tokugawa who destroyed his home when he was a baby and sentenced his parents, the leaders of the village, to death. Though shocked by this revelation, Kichiro, true to the samurai code, remains loyal to Tokugawa and helps Mototada at ensuing battle at Fushimi. After Kichiro escorts the non-combatants to safety, he is forced to leave Mototada to fight alone. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> breaches the final defenses, Mototada commits seppuku, detailing in his last statement the importance of loyalty. Kichiro joins Tokugawa at Sekigahara. After the Battle of Sekigahara ends in victory for Tokugawa, Kichiro makes up his mind and abandons his loyalty to his master and rides away through the war-torn battlefield, forsaking his honor and shaming his family name for generations to come, which Mototada had foreseen.|$|E
