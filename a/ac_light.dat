5000|$|A {{class of}} {{laboratory}} power meters has an extended sensitivity, {{of the order}} of -110 dBm. This is achieved by using a very small detector and lens combination, and also a mechanical light chopper at typically 270 Hz, so the meter actually measures <b>AC</b> <b>light.</b> This eliminates unavoidable dc electrical drift effects. If the light chopping is synchronized with an appropriate synchronous (or [...] "lock-in") amplifier, further sensitivity gains are achieved. In practice, such instruments usually achieve lower absolute accuracy due to the small detector diode, and for the same reason, may only be accurate when coupled with singlemode fiber. Occasionally such an instrument may have a cooled detector, though with the modern abandonment of Germanium sensors, and the introduction of InGaAs sensors, this is now increasingly uncommon.|$|E

A review of <b>AC</b> <b>lighting</b> technology is presented, which discusses {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} various lamps. The best lamps for small lighting systems are compact fluorescent. The best lamps for intermediate-size systems are high- or low-pressure sodium. Specifications for battery charging and load control are provided with the goal of achieving lamp lifetimes on the order of 16, 000 to 24, 000 hours and battery lifetimes of 4 to 5 years. A rough estimate of the potential domestic and global markets for stand-alone <b>AC</b> <b>lighting</b> systems is presented. DC current injection tests were performed on high-pressure sodium lamps and the test results are presented.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a current-balancing circuit for security lights that uses parallel-connected LEDs. The parallel connection of LEDs causes current {{differences between the}} LED strings because of characteristic deviations. These differences can reduce the lifespan of a particular point of LEDs by thermal spotting. They can also cause non-uniform luminance of the lighting device. Among the different methods for solving these problems, the method using current-balancing transformers {{makes it easy to}} compensate for current differences and it has a simple circuitry. However, while the balancing transformer has been applied to <b>AC</b> <b>light</b> sources, LEDs operate on a DC source, so the driving circuitry and the design method have to be changed and their performances must be verified. Thus in this paper, a design method of the balancing transformer network and the driving circuitry for LEDs is proposed. The proposed design method could have a smaller size than the conventional design method. The proposed circuitry is applied to three types of 100 -watt LED security lights, which use different LEDs. Experimental results are presented to verify the performance of the designed driving circuits. ...|$|E

2500|$|In America, George Westinghouse who {{had become}} {{interested}} in the power transformer developed by Gaulard and Gibbs, began to develop his <b>AC</b> <b>lighting</b> system, using a transmission system with a 20:1 step up voltage with step-down. In 1890 Westinghouse and Stanley built a system to transmit power several miles to a mine in Colorado. A decision was taken to use AC for power transmission from the Niagara Power Project to Buffalo, New York. Proposals submitted by vendors in 1890 included DC and compressed air systems. [...] A combination DC and compressed air system remained under consideration {{until late in the}} schedule. [...] Despite the protestations of the Niagara commissioner William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) the decision was taken to build an AC system, which had been proposed by both Westinghouse and General Electric. In October 1893 Westinghouse was awarded the contract to provide the first three 5,000hp, 250 rpm, 25Hz, two phase generators.|$|R
5000|$|A color {{scroller}} {{or color}} changer is an electro-mechanical lighting accessory used in theater, film, dance and concerts {{to change the}} color projected by stage lighting instruments without the need of a person {{to be in the}} vicinity of the light. A color scroller moves plastic [...] "gel" [...] color gel dyed polyester and/or other base materials coated with dyes into the beam of the light. It is generally attached to the gel frame holder at the transmitting end of a lighting fixture, so color is introduced after the beam characteristics have been defined by the optics of the lighting instrument. Most scrollers are controlled via DMX512 protocol, but some models (e.g. Wybron's Coloram IT) also utilize the RDM protocol. When color scrollers were first introduced around 1980, a number of companies produced them, including: Avolites, GAM Products, Morpheus Lights, Rainbow, Rosco Laboratories and Wybron Inc.

30|$|During the {{optimization}} process, different ACs {{are reduced}} in different periods since various priorities {{are defined by}} each user for each period.

However, there are some periods that AC reduction is not adequate, therefore the optimization will entire to the light reduction as Fig. 8 – (b) shows. Similar to <b>ACs,</b> the <b>lights</b> with low priority is reduced first. Then, the system reduced the high priority lights. Also, there are some periods during optimization, namely period # 10, # 14, and # 19, the AC reduction attains to around 3.4  kW, and therefore, there is no reduction in the lighting system.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{proposed}} {{system is}} based on image processing and embedded to develop a system in the seminar hall / classroom {{in order to reduce}} electricity wastage. There is no need of a centralized control room as the system will be automatic. In this direction of controlling,the wastage of power will be reduced. The methods that are used in this project are designed the circuit, write a code, simulation, synthesis and implement in hardware. In this project, AVR studio Software is chosen to write assembly C coding and MATLAB is used to write code for DIP part. We have designed a system which automatically operates the AC/fan, light and manages the power. Using CCTV / webcam we will capture the image of hall/classroom and using Camshift algorithm human will be detected and this will be given as input to atmega 16. Different temperature and light sensors are used. The controller will then check them and later the connection to relay will be done accordingly, which will turn on the Fan / <b>AC,</b> <b>lights</b> automatically if necessary. This whole system will help in reduction of the power wastage thus saving the electricity. This system is economical. Index Terms — AVR algorithm, CAMSHIFT algorithm, fac...|$|R

5000|$|Due to {{the hazards}} {{presented}} by high voltage electrical lines most European {{cities and the}} city of Chicago in the US required them to be buried underground. The City of New York did not require burying and had {{little in the way of}} regulation so by the end of 1887 the mishmash of overhead wires for telephone, telegraph, fire and burglar alarm systems in Manhattan were now mixed with haphazardly strung <b>AC</b> <b>lighting</b> system wires carrying up to 6000 volts. Insulation on power lines was rudimentary, with one electrician referring to it as having as much value [...] "as a molasses covered rag", and exposure to the elements was eroding it over time. A third of the wires were simply abandoned by defunct companies and slowly deteriorating, causing damage to, and shorting out the other lines. Besides being an eyesore, New Yorkers were annoyed when a large March 1888 snowstorm (the Great Blizzard of 1888) tore down a large number of the lines, cutting off utilities in the city. This spurred on the idea of having these lines moved underground but it was stopped by a court injunction obtained by Western Union. Legislation that would give all the utilities 90 days to move their lines into underground conduits supplied by the city was slowly making its way through the government but that was also being fought in court by the United States Illuminating Company, who claimed their AC lines were perfectly safe.|$|R
