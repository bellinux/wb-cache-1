60|$|DEAR JOE,--... I {{have had}} a {{handsome}} success, in one way, here. I left New York under a sort of half promise to furnish to the Harper magazines 30,000 words this year. Magazining is difficult work because every third page represents 2 pages that you have put in the fire; (because you are nearly sure to start wrong twice) <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have finished an article {{and are willing to}} let it go to print it represents only 10 cents a word instead of 30.|$|E

"I used {{to notice}} so many couples from the States when {{we lived in}} the city," [...] {{continued}} the hospitable mistress of the house, [...] "but I don't think they often came out to Sillery. In fact, you're the only pair that's come this summer; <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> seemed interested about the mission, I thought you wouldn't mind if I spoke to you, and asked you in to see the house. Most of the Americans stay long enough to visit the citadel, and the Plains of Abraham, and the Falls at Montmorenci, and then they go away. I should think they'd be tired always doing the same things. To be sure, they're always different people." ...|$|E
60|$|Then all the thrushes hopped for joy, {{and that}} very day was begun the celebrated Building of the Boat. All their {{ordinary}} business fell into arrears. It was {{the time of the}} year when they should have been pairing, but not a thrush's nest was built except this big one, and so Solomon soon ran short of thrushes with which to supply the demand from the mainland. The stout, rather greedy children, who look so well in perambulators but get puffed easily when they walk, were all young thrushes once, and ladies often ask specially for them. What do you think Solomon did? He sent over to the house-tops for a lot of sparrows and ordered them to lay their eggs in old thrushes' nests, and sent their young to the ladies and swore they were all thrushes! It was known afterwards on the island as the Sparrows' Year; <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> meet grown-up people in the Gardens who puff and blow as if they thought themselves bigger than they are, very likely they belong to that year.

You did not know, and I {{should not have been}} offended; I see that now. But {{there was no one to}} tell you what I could not, that upon Barsoom there are two kinds of women in the cities of the red men. The one they fight for that they may ask them in marriage; the other kind they fight for also, but never ask their hands. When a man has won a woman he may address her as his princess, or in any of the several terms which signify possession. You had fought for me, but had never asked me in marriage, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> called me your princess, you see," [...] she faltered, [...] "I was hurt, but even then, John Carter, I did not repulse you, as I should have done, until you made it doubly worse by taunting me with having won me through combat." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{a breakfast}} {{room of the}} castle on this breezy fine morning there are two persons and the cooling remains of a deserted meal. One of these persons is the old lord, tall, erect, square-shouldered, white-haired, stern-browed, a man who shows {{character}} in every feature, attitude, and movement, and carries his seventy years as easily as most men carry fifty. The other person is his only son and heir, a dreamy-eyed young fellow, who looks about twenty-six but is nearer thirty. Candor, kindliness, honesty, sincerity, simplicity, modesty--it {{is easy to see}} that these are cardinal traits of his character; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have clothed him in the formidable components of his name, you somehow seem to be contemplating a lamb in armor: his name and style being the Honourable Kirkcudbright Llanover Marjorihanks Sellers Viscount-Berkeley, of Cholmondeley Castle, Warwickshire. (Pronounced K'koobry Thlanover Marshbanks Sellers Vycount Barkly, of Chumly Castle, Warrikshr.) He is standing by a great window, in an attitude suggestive of respectful attention to what his father is saying and equally respectful dissent from the positions and arguments offered. The father walks the floor as he talks, and his talk shows that his temper is away up toward summer heat.|$|E
60|$|These Romanists are strange beings. Such a {{one among}} them--whom you know {{no more than}} the last Inca of Peru, or the first Emperor of China--knows you and all your concerns; and has his reasons for saying to you so <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> simply thought the {{communication}} sprang impromptu from the instant's impulse: his plan in bringing it about that you shall come on such a day, to such a place, under such and such circumstances, when the whole arrangement seems to your crude apprehension the ordinance of chance, or the sequel of exigency. Madame Beck's suddenly-recollected message and present, my artless embassy to the Place of the Magi, the old priest accidentally descending the steps and crossing the square, his interposition on my behalf with the bonne who would have sent me away, his reappearance on the staircase, my introduction to this room, the portrait, the narrative so affably volunteered--all these little incidents, taken as they fell out, seemed each independent of its successor; a handful of loose beads: but threaded through by that quick-shot and crafty glance of a Jesuit-eye, they dropped pendent in a long string, like that rosary on the prie-dieu. Where lay the link of junction, where the little clasp of this monastic necklace? I saw or felt union, but could not yet find the spot, or detect the means of connection.|$|E

[...] It must be very funny, and to a spectator like yourself I almost envy it. But never get desperate; human nature is human nature; and the Roman Empire, since the Romans founded it and made our European human nature what it is, bids fair to go on and to be true to itself.

[...] Former Governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, called the president [...] "naive" [...] and repeatedly invoked the Holocaust, saying that the president's policy would [...] "take the Israelis and march them {{to the door of the}} oven". This comparison was denounced by the Anti-Defamation League, the National Jewish Democratic Council, and various Israeli government officials. At a 27 June news conference, Obama specifically criticized Huckabee, Cruz, and Cotton, saying that such remarks were [...] "just part of a general pattern we've seen that would be considered ridiculous if it weren't so sad", especially from [...] "leaders in the Republican Party". Obama stated that [...] "flinging out ad hominem attacks like that ... doesn't help inform the American people" [...] and stated: [...] "This is a deal that has been endorsed by people like Brent Scowcroft and Sam Nunn ... historic Democratic and Republican leaders on arms control and on keeping America safe. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> get rhetoric like this, maybe it gets attention and maybe this is just an effort to push Mr. Trump out of the headlines, but it's not the kind of leadership that is needed for America right now." ...|$|E

She comes from a place of strength always. <b>And</b> <b>so,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are dealing with someone like that, you feel absolutely free to be vulnerable, to be creative, and I am a big researcher." [...] On playing the character, Nielsen said [...] "It was a complete and utter pleasure and I absolutely loved every second of playing her." [...] On her character being Diana's mother and Amazonian queen, Nielsen stated [...] "I'm queen and I'm preparing my child for a world that entails a lot of responsibility. So it was important to me to bring that into the character." [...] She read The Amazons by Adrienne Mayor to familiarize herself with women warriors and said [...] "I used what I learned in Mayor's book as a rallying cry for how I approached Hippolyta. And then, of course, what is a leader who is elected by her peers every year and has been doing this for a thousand years? That too was interesting to think about". Nielsen went through a workout regime for the film, saying [...] "I did six hours a day. You know, two hours of weight training, two hours of swords training, and then two hours of horseback riding". Nicole Kidman was in negotiations for the role but was forced to drop due to scheduling conflicts with Big Little Lies. Previously, Nielsen had been considered for the role of Superman's mother, Lara Lor-Van, in Man of Steel.|$|E
