25|$|Decoupling {{capacitors}} {{need not}} always be discrete components. Capacitors used in these applications may be built into <b>a</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board, between the various layers. These are {{often referred to as}} embedded capacitors. The layers in the board contributing to the capacitive properties also function as power and ground planes, and have a dielectric in between them, enabling them to operate as a parallel plate capacitor.|$|E

25|$|The {{last two}} metrics appear {{for example in}} routing a machine that drills a given set of holes in <b>a</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board.

The maximum metric corresponds to a machine that adjusts both co-ordinates simultaneously, so the time to move to a new point is the slower of the two movements.|$|E
25|$|When {{the board}} has no {{embedded}} components it is more correctly called a printed wiring board (PWB) or etched wiring board. However, the term printed wiring board has fallen into disuse. A PCB populated with electronic components is called <b>a</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> assembly (PCA), {{printed circuit board assembly}} or PCB assembly (PCBA). The IPC preferred term for assembled boards is circuit card assembly (CCA), and for assembled backplanes it is backplane assemblies. The term PCB is used informally both for bare and assembled boards.|$|E
25|$|Heat {{dissipation}} is {{an unavoidable}} by-product of electronic devices and circuits. In general, {{the temperature of}} the device or component will depend on the thermal resistance from the component to the environment, and the heat dissipated by the component. To ensure that the component does not overheat, a thermal engineer seeks to find an efficient heat transfer path from the device to the environment. The heat transfer path may be from the component to <b>a</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board (PCB), to a heat sink, to air flow provided by a fan, but in all instances, eventually to the environment.|$|E

25|$|In 1948 {{researchers}} at Fort Monmouth grew the first synthetically produced large quartz crystals. The crystals {{were able to}} be used in the manufacture of electronic components, and made the United States largely independent of foreign imports for this critical mineral. In 1949 the first auto-assembly of printed circuits was invented. A technique for assembling electronic parts on <b>a</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board, developed by Fort Monmouth engineers, pioneered the development and fabrication of miniature circuits for both military and civilian use. Although they did not invent the transistor, Fort Monmouth scientists were among the first to recognize its importance, particularly in military applications, and did pioneer significant improvements in its composition and production.|$|E
25|$|The {{dielectric}} films, {{depending on}} the desired dielectric strength, are drawn in a special process to an extremely thin thickness, and are then provided with electrodes. The electrodes of film capacitors may be metallized aluminum or zinc applied directly {{to the surface of}} the plastic film, or a separate metallic foil. Two of these conductive layers are wound into a cylinder shaped winding, usually flattened to reduce mounting space requirements on <b>a</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board, or layered as multiple single layers stacked together, to form a capacitor body. Film capacitors, together with ceramic capacitors and electrolytic capacitors, are the most common capacitor types for use in electronic equipment, and are used in many AC and DC microelectronics and electronics circuits.|$|E
25|$|The {{address bus}} of the PowerPC 603 can {{theoretically}} access memory up to 64 MB. However, the operating system's maximum addressable memory size is 37 MB. Furthermore, {{because of the}} ASIC design of the Pippin hardware, the maximum RAM size that can be added is 32 MB. Officially, Bandai produced memory upgrade modules of 2, 4, 8 and 16 MB. The memory chips are soldered onto <b>a</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board which is placed in a plastic housing, making installation into a Pippin system simple for the end user. Japanese hackers produced an aftermarket 16 MB module, but because the module was {{much larger than the}} memory module compartment on the Pippin, installation required removing the logic board from the chassis, and then mounting the large memory module in-between the logic board and chassis.|$|E

25|$|Very small lamps {{may have}} the {{filament}} support wires extended through {{the base of the}} lamp, and can be directly soldered to <b>a</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board for connections. Some reflector-type lamps include screw terminals for connection of wires. Most lamps have metal bases that fit in a socket to support the lamp and conduct current to the filament wires. In the late 19th century, manufacturers introduced a multitude of incompatible lamp bases. General Electric introduced standard base sizes for tungsten incandescent lamps under the Mazda trademark in 1909. This standard was soon adopted across the US, and the Mazda name was used by many manufacturers under license through 1945. Today most incandescent lamps for general lighting service use an Edison screw in candelabra, intermediate, or standard or mogul sizes, or double contact bayonet base. Technical standards for lamp bases include ANSI standard C81.67 and IEC standard 60061-1 for common commercial lamp sizes, to ensure interchangeablitity between different manufacturer's products. Bayonet base lamps are frequently used in automotive lamps to resist loosening due to vibration. A bipin base is often used for halogen or reflector lamps.|$|E
