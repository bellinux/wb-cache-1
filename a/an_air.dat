5|$|<b>An</b> <b>air</b> well or aerial well is a {{structure}} or device that collects water by promoting the condensation of moisture from air. Designs for air wells are many and varied, but the simplest designs are completely passive, require no external energy source and have few, if any, moving parts.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>air</b> well {{should not}} be {{confused}} with a dew pond. A dew pond is an artificial pond intended for watering livestock. The name dew pond (sometimes cloud pond or mist pond) derives from the widely held belief that the pond was filled by moisture from the air. In fact, dew ponds are primarily filled by rainwater.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} to self-contained breathing systems is to supply breathing gases {{from the surface}} through a hose. When combined with a communication cable, a pneumofathometer hose and a safety line {{it is called the}} diver's umbilical, which may include a hot water hose for heating, video cable and breathing gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that uses only <b>an</b> <b>air</b> hose is called an airline or hookah system. This allows the diver to breathe using <b>an</b> <b>air</b> supply hose from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. Breathing gas is supplied through a mouth-held demand valve or light full-face mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as snuba, a shallow water activity typically practised by tourists and those who are not scuba-certified.|$|E
