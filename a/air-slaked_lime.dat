According to the Adelaide Mail:The pen that has written so many fine books of the Australian out back here makes a valuable contribution in a simple and detailed account intended especially for theworking miner and small syndicate. The process is practically explained from A to Z, whether the reader can invest only £20 in a plant, or a syndicate or company can afford £2,000. Most of the material has been gathered from plants working profitably today, and {{from the experience of}} practical men well known in the Australasian cyaniding world, while numerous illustrations and diagrams further assist the reader. The result is a book that should be particularly valuable, even to non technical readers.|$|E

The microstructures of such materials are characterized by a relatively high filling rate, platy orthotropic particles distributed {{on a wide range}} of spatial directions, and a high level of porosity at meso and micro scales. An iterative micromechanical modeling is here enhanced with some numerical features allowing to deal with the shape and orientation of the particles and with the resulting effective anisotropy of concretes. The model thus constructed is first put into practice to identify the properties of hemp shives and <b>air-slaked</b> <b>lime</b> for various compaction degrees. The results obtained are then used as input data to estimate the thermal and mechanical properties of both a collection of moderately com-pacted concretes, and a set of concretes with several compaction degrees. Simulations results are eventually confronted with experimental data from the literature...|$|E
