He learns the truth about Margaret's brother from Nicholas Higgins, and comes to London to settle his business affairs with Margaret. When Margaret presents Thornton with a generous business proposal, he realises that {{she is no longer}} indifferent or antagonistic to him. He again proposes marriage <b>and,</b> <b>since</b> <b>she</b> has learned to love him, she accepts him.|$|E
25|$|Encouraged to {{continue}} her career, McVie recorded a solo album, Christine Perfect; following her success {{as a member of}} Fleetwood Mac, the album was reissued under the name The Legendary Christine Perfect Album. After marrying Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie, she joined Fleetwood Mac in 1970. She had already contributed backup vocals and painted the cover for Kiln House. The band had just lost founding member Peter Green, and its members were nervous about touring without him. McVie had been a huge fan of the Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac; <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>she</b> knew all the lyrics to their songs, she went along.|$|E
25|$|When {{high school}} student Tohru Honda's mother dies in a car crash, Tohru decides {{to live with her}} grandfather. Renovations on the house and unsupportive and unkind family members cause her to move out of her grandfather's house {{temporarily}} <b>and,</b> <b>since</b> <b>she</b> has nowhere else to go, Tohru begins living in a tent and supporting herself. That is, until she finds a home in the least likely of places, inhabited by her popular classmate Yuki Sohma and his cousin Shigure. The first day Tohru moves into the Sohma house, an orange haired teenager crashes through the roof of her new bedroom and starts attacking Yuki. This newcomer is Kyo, Yuki and Shigure's aggressively angry cousin. Once Kyo loses quickly to Yuki, he tries to fight him again. When he’s about to attack, Tohru tries to stop him, but slips on an article of clothing, making her fall onto Kyo’s back. When this happens, Tohru discovers something big about the Sohmas.|$|E

However, the committee concluded that she had acted without [...] "deceptive intent", <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>she</b> was leaving Congress anyway, no action against her was taken. Ferraro said, [...] "I consider myself completely vindicated."

500|$|Variety {{magazine}} {{praised the}} performances, writing, [...] "Dafoe gives a disciplined and noteworthy portrayal of Ward... But it's Hackman who steals the picture as Anderson... Glowing performance of Frances McDormand as the deputy's wife who's drawn to Hackman is an asset both to his role and the picture." [...] Sheila Benson, in her review for the Los Angeles Times, wrote, [...] "Hackman's mastery at suggesting {{an infinite number}} of layers beneath a wry, self-deprecating surface reaches a peak here, but McDormand soars right with him. <b>And</b> <b>since</b> <b>she</b> is the film's sole voice of morality, it's right that she is so memorable." ...|$|E
500|$|Her {{deception}} did {{not last}} long, for Capt. Hermógenes Cámus saw through her disguise immediately—because of her curved figure and [...] "feminine beauty," [...] he said. Nonetheless, he allowed her to be an unauthorised army cantinière and nurse. These were the only positions available to women in the army at the time, and many women effectively served as both, which Morales did. As a cantinière, she sold food and drink to supplement soldiers' monotonous basic rations, staying with them at their camp and marching with them on operations, <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>she</b> was a nurse, {{she had to be}} present immediately after battles to care for the wounded.|$|E

500|$|Barney's attitudes during World War II {{have been}} controversial. [...] In 1937, Una, Lady Troubridge had complained that Barney [...] "talked {{a lot of}} half-baked {{nonsense}} about the tyranny of fascism". Barney herself was one-quarter Jewish, <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>she</b> spent the war in Italy with Romaine Brooks, risked deportation to a concentration camp—a fate she avoided only by wiring her sister Laura for a notarized document attesting to her confirmation. [...] Nevertheless, having no other {{source of information about}} the war, she believed Axis propaganda that portrayed the Allies as the aggressors, so that pro-Fascism seemed to her to be a logical consequence of her pacifism. [...] An unpublished memoir she wrote during the war years is pro-Fascist and anti-Semitic, quoting speeches by Hitler, apparently with approval.|$|E

2500|$|The {{case that}} {{consolidated}} Spilsbury's reputation as Britain's foremost forensic pathologist was the [...] "Brides in the Bath" [...] murder trial in 1915. Three women had died mysteriously in their baths; in each case, the death {{appeared to be}} an accident. George Joseph Smith was brought to trial for the murder of one of these women, Bessie Mundy.

2500|$|Another {{additional}} {{scene with}} Donna [...] {{was cut from}} the final episode: [...] "There was an additional Donna bit after this goodbye from the Doctor, which is when he goes outside into the TARDIS, we cut back into the kitchen, and there's a moment where Donna hears the TARDIS... there's a moment of realisation, and then she turns back round and carries on talking into the phone." [...] Gardner considered this scene untruthful and too confusing, since Donna remembering would lead to her death, <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>she</b> didn't recognise the Doctor it wouldn't make sense to assume she would recognise {{the noise of the}} TARDIS.|$|E
2500|$|Producer Leonard Goldberg, had {{the initial}} idea three years previously, {{for a show}} {{that would be a}} cross between The Avengers and Honey West, a {{short-lived}} drama from the 1960s about a female private eye. Goff and Roberts had first titled the series The Alley Cats in which the three females (named Allison, Lee, and Catherine) would reside in alleys and wear whips and chains. Jackson disapproved of the title, <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>she</b> was given semi-control over the development of the series, she encouraged producers to find a new title. However, it was Jackson who decided the three women would be called [...] "Angels" [...] after seeing a picture of three angels hanging in Spelling's office, and the series became known as Harry's Angels. This title was dropped, however, when ABC did not want to run into conflict with the series Harry O, and was thereby changed to Charlie's Angels.|$|E
2500|$|I shall pass lightly over {{an event}} which, engrafted upon some others, made some noise, {{notwithstanding}} the care taken to hush it up. The Duchess of Burgundy supped at Saint-Cloud one evening with the Duchess of Berry and others, Madame de Saint-Simon absenting {{herself from the}} party. The Duchess of Berry and the Duke of Orléans, but she more than he, got so drunk that the Duchess of Burgundy, the Duchess of Orléans, {{and the rest of}} the company knew not what to do. The Duke of Berry was there, and him they talked over as well as they could, and the numerous company was amused by the Grand Duchess, to the best of her ability. The effect of the wine in more ways than one was such that people were troubled, <b>and,</b> <b>since</b> <b>she</b> could not be sobered, it became necessary to carry her back, drunk as she was, to Versailles.

2500|$|King Arthur holds a tournament, which Sir Lancelot attends in disguise. [...] He stays for {{one night}} at the castle of the Earl of Ascolat, and there the earl's {{daughter}} {{falls in love with}} him, even though she knows Lancelot loves someone else. [...] Lancelot is injured at the tournament, and is invited by the earl to recuperate at Ascolat. [...] Lancelot leaves when he has recovered, giving the earl's daughter his armour as a memento. [...] Ascolat is then visited by Gawain, who has come from Camelot to search for Lancelot. [...] The earl's daughter, still not knowing Lancelot's name, shows Gawain the armour, which he recognises. [...] On his return to Camelot Gawain tells Arthur that Lancelot loves the earl's daughter. [...] When Lancelot arrives at Camelot he receives so little welcome from his lover, Guinevere, that he leaves again in confusion. [...] Guinevere then finds herself falsely accused of murdering a Scottish knight, and must find a champion to defend her in a trial by combat. [...] The body of the maid of Ascolat is discovered in a boat, floating down the river into Camelot, along with a note in which the maid bewails Lancelot’s refusal of her love. [...] Lancelot returns to successfully defend Guinevere, <b>and</b> <b>since</b> <b>she</b> now knows that he is true to her she is reconciled with him. [...] The two are surprised in bed together by several of Arthur's knights, but Lancelot escapes, killing in the process all of the knights except Mordred. [...] Guinevere is sentenced to death, but Lancelot again rescues her and takes her to his castle, Joyous Gard. [...] Arthur besieges Joyous Gard, but without effect. [...] The Pope now orders Lancelot to send Guinevere back to Arthur, and Arthur to accept her. [...] Both comply, but Lancelot goes into exile. [...] Arthur takes his army abroad to levy war against Lancelot, leaving Guinevere behind in the custody of Mordred. [...] Gawain, now an inveterate enemy of Lancelot, fights a single combat with him, and is defeated. [...] Word comes that Mordred has crowned himself king and plans to marry Guinevere. [...] Arthur returns home and defeats Mordred's army in two battles, but Gawain is killed. [...] Before a third battle can be fought Arthur dreams that he is cast down from the high point of the Wheel of Fortune. [...] In a second dream Gawain warns him he must call a truce so as to give Lancelot's army time to join him. [...] The next day Arthur and Mordred, each accompanied by fourteen knights, meet to discuss peace terms. [...] The truce is broken by mistake when one of the knights draws his sword to kill an adder. [...] Battle is joined and the armies are so equally matched that both are exterminated, with the exception of Mordred, Arthur, and Arthur's knights Bedivere and Lucan. [...] Arthur kills Mordred, but is himself mortally wounded. [...] At Arthur's command, Bedivere throws Excalibur into the sea. [...] Three ladies come to take Arthur to Avalon to be healed, but they fail in this purpose, and the next day Bedivere comes across Arthur's newly erected tomb. [...] Guinevere, repenting of her adultery, takes the veil at Amesbury. [...] Lancelot arrives on the scene belatedly and visits Guinevere. [...] They renounce each other in favour of a life of penance, and Lancelot accordingly becomes a monk. [...] The poem ends with their death and burial seven years later.|$|E
