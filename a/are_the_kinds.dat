Buck said, [...] "The verses <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of things R.E.M. uses a lot, going from one minor to another, kind [...] like those 'Driver 8' chords. You can't really say {{anything}} bad about E minor, A minor, D, and G– I mean, they're just good chords." [...] Buck noted that [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] was [...] "probably the most typical R.E.M.-sounding song on the record. We {{are trying to get}} away from those kind of songs, but like I said before, those are some good chords." [...] Orchestral strings play through parts of the song. The song is in natural minor.|$|E

Conversely, Lana Wachowski has said Joel [...] "made that up." [...] The Wachowskis themselves claim they [...] "decided simply to focus on making their own directorial debut." [...] They had the idea to write a story about how one might see a woman on the street and make assumptions about her sexuality, but how those assumptions might be wrong. They wanted to play with stereotypes and make an entertaining film that contained sex and violence, because those <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of films that they like to watch. Seeing film noir as a genre within which they could tell a contained story and twist conventions, they described Billy Wilder as a big influence.|$|E

500|$|The {{topic of}} {{abortion}} is a prominent theme in [...] "Secrets". After discovering {{that she is}} pregnant, Lori asks Glenn to retrieve with emergency contraception pills from the pharmacy. Upon returning, an infuriated Maggie hands Lori her pills. Dale gently confronts her about her pregnancy when he sees that she becomes nauseated at the smell of cooking meat, and Lori explains that Rick is the biological father of the child. Writer Robert Kirkman opined that such assertions were [...] "wishful thinking". [...] "She was with those two men very close to each other. There was not a large span of time between her time with Shane and then Rick's return and her time with Rick. It's definitely {{up in the air}} and it’s not like there's a lot of paternity tests floating around out there." [...] Kirkman felt that he had to responsibly approach controversial issues from a neutral standpoint and insisted that abortion should warrant discussion, considering the circumstances. He stated: [...] "As far as the abortion stuff goes, it’s really just a matter of being realistic. These <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of issues that people deal with in real life and in this situation I think that that is the kind of thought process that Lori Grimes would be going through." ...|$|E
500|$|The Food Album has {{received}} mixed reviews from most critics; many felt {{that while the}} album was amusing {{it was not an}} essential release. Allmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus awarded the album three out of five stars and wrote that, [...] "The Food Album is an enjoyable bag of treats. Just don't eat too much, or you'll probably get sick." [...] Likewise, The Rolling Stone Album Guide awarded the album three out of five stars. Anthony [...] of The Buffalo News gave the album a moderately positive review and wrote that, [...] "here are two kinds of people in the world: those who love Weird Al Yankovic and those who can't stand him. Count me among the Weird One's biggest fans, and that's why I flipped out when listening to The Food Album." [...] He concluded that the album was [...] "like reading Mad magazine"; he gave the record three stars out of five. Tim Grobaty of the Press-Telegram, on the other hand, wrote negatively of the album, stating [...] "Yankovic's songs <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of things that are sort of funny in concept, less funny when you actually hear them once, and increasingly irritating with each subsequent listen [...] his food songs are among his worst." ...|$|E

They are not explicitly listed in the Torah; the Mishnah observes that [...] "the laws of Shabbat ... are like mountains hanging by a hair, for they are little Scripture but many laws".

2500|$|MTV {{began its}} annual Spring Break {{coverage}} in 1986, setting up temporary operations in Daytona Beach, Florida, {{for a week}} in March, broadcasting live eight hours per day. [...] "Spring break is a youth culture event", MTV's vice president Doug Herzog said at the time. [...] "We {{wanted to be part}} of it for that reason. It makes good sense for us to come down and go live from the center of it, because obviously the people there <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of people who watch MTV." [...] The channel's coverage featured numerous live performances from artists and bands on location.

The subjugation {{of a planet}} familiar to the audience was used to heighten the sense of danger and the stakes for the characters. In this episode, Sisko fuels a conspiracy intended to improve the war situation that ultimately results {{in the character of}} Elim Garak committing murder. In the context of the Dominion War, it is resolved to conceal the truth for the greater good. Writer Michael Taylor has suggested, [...] "It showed how Deep Space Nine could really stretch the Star Trek formula.

Bartlett {{was the first}} American author to be included on the Dufour list. For this book, Kenneth Rexroth provided the Introduction. In it, he wrote: [...] "Elizabeth Bartlett's poems are good examples of the change, {{or one of the}} changes in poetry since World War II. They are poems of direct statement. They are poems of personal communication.

2500|$|The {{publication}} of the 1996 anthology Rethinking Linguistic Relativity edited by Gumperz and Levinson began a new period of linguistic relativity studies that focused on cognitive and social aspects. The book included studies on the linguistic relativity and universalist traditions. Levinson documented significant linguistic relativity effects in the linguistic conceptualization of spatial categories between languages. Separate studies by Bowerman and Slobin treated the role of language in cognitive processes. Bowerman showed that certain cognitive processes did not use language to any significant extent and therefore could {{not be subject to}} linguistic relativity. Slobin described another kind of cognitive process that he named [...] "thinking for speaking" [...] – the kind of process in which perceptional data and other kinds of prelinguistic cognition are translated into linguistic terms for communication. These, Slobin argues, <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of cognitive process that are at the root of linguistic relativity.|$|E

60|$|When we {{ask what}} <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of objects {{with which we}} are acquainted, {{the first and most}} obvious example is sense-data. When I see a colour or hear a noise, I have direct {{acquaintance}} with the colour or the noise. The sense-datum with which I am acquainted in these cases is generally, if not always, complex. This is particularly obvious in the case of sight. I do not mean, of course, merely that the supposed physical object is complex, but that the direct sensible object is complex and contains parts with spatial relations. Whether it is possible to be aware of a complex without being aware of its constituents is not an easy question, but on the whole it would seem that {{there is no reason why}} it should not be possible. This question arises in an acute form in connection with self-consciousness, which we must now briefly consider.|$|E
6000|$|... § XXIII. First, then, {{it seems}} to me that the {{grotesque}} is, in almost all cases, composed of two elements, one ludicrous, the other fearful; that, as one or other of these elements prevails, the grotesque falls into two branches, sportive grotesque and terrible grotesque; but that we cannot legitimately consider it under these two aspects, because there are hardly any examples which do not in some degree combine both elements; there are few grotesques so utterly playful as to be overcast with no shade of fearfulness, and few so fearful as absolutely to exclude all ideas of jest. But although we cannot separate the grotesque itself into two branches, we may easily examine separately the two conditions of mind which {{it seems to}} combine; and consider successively what <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of jest, and what the kinds of fearfulness, which may be legitimately expressed in the various walks of art, and how their expressions actually occur in the Gothic and Renaissance schools.|$|E

Thus, in our {{simplest}} {{codes of}} school instruction, I hope some {{day to see}} local natural history assume a principal place, so that our peasant children may be taught the nature and uses of the herbs that grow in their meadows, and may take interest in observing and cherishing, rather than in hunting or killing, the harmless animals of their country. Supposing it determined that this local natural history should be taught, drawing ought {{to be used to}} fix the attention, and test, while it aided, the memory. [...] "Draw such and such a flower in outline, with its bell towards you. Draw it with its side towards you. Paint the spots upon it. Draw a duck's head--her foot. Now a robin's--a thrush's--now the spots upon the thrush's breast." [...] These <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of tasks which it seems to me should be set to the young peasant student. Surely the occupation would no more be thought contemptible which was thus subservient to knowledge and to compassion; and perhaps we should find in process of time that the Italian connexion of art with diletto, or delight, was both consistent with, and even mainly consequent upon, a pure Greek connexion of art with arete, or virtue.|$|E

60|$|Even among plants which {{trust to}} the {{involuntary}} services {{of animals in}} dispersing their seeds, a great many varieties of detail may be observed on close inspection. For example, in hound's-tongue and goose-grass, two of the best-known instances among our common English weeds, each little nut is covered with many small hooks, which make it catch on firmly by several points of attachment to passing animals. These <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> we human beings of either sex oftenest find clinging to our skirts or trousers after a walk in a rabbit-warren. But in herb-bennet and avens each nut has a single long awn, crooked near the middle with a very peculiar S-shaped joint, which effectually catches on to the wool or hair, but drops at the elbow after {{a short period of}} withering. Sometimes, too, the whole fruit is provided with prehensile hooks, while sometimes it is rather the individual seeds themselves that are so accommodated. Oddest of all is the plan followed by the common burdock. Here, an involucre or common cup-shaped receptacle of hooked bracts surrounds an entire head of purple tubular flowers, and each of these flowers produces in time a distinct fruit; but the hooked involucre contains the whole compound mass, and, being pulled off bodily by a stray sheep or dog, effects the transference of the composite lot at once to some fitting place for their germination.|$|E
6000|$|We {{now come}} to the large class of {{coloured}} or richly spotted eggs, {{and here we have}} a more difficult task, though many of them decidedly exhibit protective tints or markings. There are two birds which nest on sandy shores--the lesser tern and the ringed plover,--and both lay sand-coloured eggs, the former spotted so as to harmonise with coarse shingle, the latter minutely speckled like fine sand, which <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of ground the two birds choose respectively for their nests. [...] "The common sandpipers' eggs assimilate so closely with the tints around them as to make their discovery a matter of no small difficulty, as every oologist can testify who has searched for them. The pewits' eggs, dark in ground colour and boldly marked, are in strict harmony with the sober tints of moor and fallow, and on this circumstance alone their concealment and safety depend. The divers' eggs furnish another example of protective colour; they are generally laid close to the water's edge, amongst drift and shingle, where their dark tints and black spots conceal them by harmonising closely with surrounding objects. The snipes and the great army of sandpipers furnish innumerable instances of protectively coloured eggs. In all the instances given the sitting-bird invariably leaves the eggs uncovered when it quits them, and consequently their safety depends solely on the colours which adorn them."[81] The wonderful range of colour and marking in the eggs of the guillemot may be imputed to the inaccessible rocks on which it breeds, giving it complete protection from enemies. Thus the pale or bluish ground colour of the eggs of its allies, the auks and puffins, has become intensified and blotched and spotted in the most marvellous variety of patterns, owing to there being no selective agency to prevent individual variation having full sway.|$|E
60|$|At the gate, just as Herbert {{was about}} to remount his horse, they were {{encountered}} by a sight which for years past had not been uncommon {{in the south of}} Ireland, but which had become frightfully common during {{the last two or three}} months. A woman was standing there, of whom you could hardly say that she was clothed, though she was involved in a mass of rags which covered her nakedness. Her head was all uncovered, and her wild black hair was streaming round her face. Behind her back hung two children enveloped among the rags in some mysterious way; and round about her on the road stood three others, of whom the two younger were almost absolutely naked. The eldest of the five was not above seven. They all had the same wild black eyes, and wild elfish straggling locks; but neither the mother nor the children were comely. She was short and broad in the shoulders, though wretchedly thin; her bare legs seemed to be of nearly the same thickness up to the knee, and the naked limbs of the children were like yellow sticks. It is strange how various <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of physical development among the Celtic peasantry in Ireland. In many places they are singularly beautiful, especially as children; and even after labour and sickness shall have told on them as labour and sickness will tell, they still retain a certain softness and grace which is very nearly akin to beauty. But then again in a neighbouring district they will be found to be squat, uncouth, and in no way attractive to the eye. The tint of the complexion, the nature of the hair, the colour of the eyes, shall be the same. But in one place it will seem as though noble blood had produced delicate limbs and elegant stature, whereas in the other a want of noble blood had produced the reverse. The peasants of Clare, Limerick, and Tipperary are, in this way, much more comely than those of Cork and Kerry.|$|E
