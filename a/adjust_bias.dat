40|$|The {{interaction}} blockade phenomenon isolates {{the motion}} of a single quantum particle within a multi-particle system, in particular for coherent oscillations {{in and out of}} a region affected by the blockade mechanism. For identical quantum particles with Bose statistics, the presence of the other particles is still felt by a bosonic stimulation factor √(N) that speeds up the coherent oscillations, where N is the number of bosons. Here we propose an experiment to observe this enhancement factor with a small number of bosonic atoms. The proposed protocol realises an asymmetric double well potential with multiple optical tweezer laser beams. The ability to <b>adjust</b> <b>bias</b> independently of the coherent coupling between the wells allows the potential to be loaded with different particle numbers while maintaining the resonance condition needed for coherent oscillations. Numerical simulations with up to three bosons in a realistic potential generated by three optical tweezers predict that the relevant avoided level crossing can be probed and the expected bosonic enhancement factor observed.

40|$|Changes of {{diagnostic}} coverage and criteria for psychiatric disorders {{in the fifth}} edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM- 5) published in 2013 cause a need for updating the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Epidemiological version (K-SADS-E). This study examined the preliminary psychometric properties, including inter-rater reliability, and convergent and divergent validity of the modified K-SADS-E for DSM- 5. Methods: A national survey of a school-based sample of 3242 students in grade 3, 5, and 7 from 44 schools was conducted in Northern, Central, and Southern Taiwan. Psychiatric diagnoses {{were made by the}} K-SADS-E interviews. Clinical questionnaires for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and emotional and behavioral problems were examined using the Chinese version of the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham IV scale, Social Responsiveness Scale, and Child Behavior Checklist. Results: The K-SADS-E showed satisfactory inter-rater reliability (prevalence <b>adjusted</b> <b>bias</b> <b>adjusted</b> kappa =  0. 80 – 1. 00) among eight interviewers. The diagnoses of K-SADS-E demonstrated good convergent and divergent validity with most corresponding clinical questionnaires.

We compared genotyping interpretation, {{based on the}} Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database (Stanford HIVdb), and virtual phenotyping, based on the Janssen Diagnostics BVBA’s vircoTYPE™ HIV- 1, and investigated their level of agreement in antiretroviral (ARV) naive patients in Asia, where non-B subtypes predominate. Methods: Sequences from 1301 ARV-naive patients enrolled in the TREAT Asia Studies to Evaluate Resistance – Monitoring Study (TASER-M) were analysed by both interpreting systems. Interpretations from both Stanford HIVdb and vircoTYPE™ HIV- 1 were initially grouped into 2 levels: susceptible and non-susceptible.

40|$|Abstract. [...] The EM (expectation-maximization) {{algorithm}} {{was used}} to develop a general pro-cedure for finding maximum likelihood estimates of population proportions when some obser-vations cannot be assigned unambiguously to a population category. The method {{can be used to}} estimate the age composition of fish from length frequencies, to <b>adjust</b> <b>biased</b> estimates of age composition (e. g., scale ages that tend to be too low), and to correct biased estimates of unit stock composition. To implement the method, two samples are obtained. In the first sample, the items are cross-classified by their actual identity and by a second (possibly error-prone) surrogate clas-sifying variable. In the second sample, the items are classified by only the surrogate variable. The information in the two samples is then used to estimate the population proportions in the second sample. A variety of seemingly unrelated problems in fisheries science can be shown to be special cases of a general problem involving partially classified contingency tables. Consequently, these problems can be solved by a single, simple statistical meth...|$|R
