40|$|Background: To {{inform the}} design of a {{randomised}} controlled trial (RCT) of an exercise-based programme for long term stroke survivors, we conducted a mixed methods before-and-after case series with assessment at three time points. We evaluated <b>Action</b> <b>for</b> <b>Rehabilitation</b> from Neurological Injury (ARNI), a personalised, functionally-focussed programme. It was delivered through 24 hours of one-to-one training by an Exercise Professional (EP), plus at least 2 hours weekly unsupervised exercise, over 12 - 14 weeks. Assessment was by patient-rated questionnaires addressing function, physical activity, confidence, fatigue and health-related quality of life; objective assessment of gait quality and speed; qualitative individual interviews conducted with participants. Data were collected at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. Fidelity and acceptability was assessed by participant interviews, audit of participant and EP records, and observation of training. Findings: Four of six enrolled participants completed the exercise programme. Quantitative data demonstrated little change across the sample, but marked changes on some measures for some individuals. Qualitative interviews suggested that small benefits in physical outcomes could be of great psychological significance to participants. Participant-reported fatigue levels commonly increased, and non-completers said they found the programme too demanding. Most key components of the intervention were delivered, but there were several potentially important departures from intervention fidelity. Discussion: The study provided data and experience that are helping to inform {{the design of}} an RCT of this intervention. It suggested the need for a broader recruitment strategy; indicated areas that could be explored in more depth in the qualitative component of the trial; and highlighted issues that should be addressed to enhance and evaluate fidelity, particularly in the preparation and monitoring of intervention providers. The experience illustrates the value of even small sample before-and-after studies in the development of trials of complex interventions. PenCLAHRC; NIH...|$|E

40|$|The {{study has}} {{analyzed}} {{the impacts of}} globalization on work organization and labour relations in Pakistan. It has examined various policy measures initiated by the Government of Pakistan to address the imbalances created by globalization. The study, in the end, presents certain recommendations for benefits of the working class, especially, {{for those who have}} been badly affected. It also suggests a way forward to capitalize on the process of globalization. The thesis highlights the far reaching effects of globalization on work organization and labour relations in Pakistan. The work organization has been flexibilized, disintegrated and informalized. It is characterized with contract labour, piece-rate work, home-based work, temporary labour and a bulk of self-employment. Most of production in the formal sector is being either contracted out within the factory premises or outsourced to different vendors in the informal sector. The informal sector is rapidly expanding and employing most of the new entrants in the labour market. Women and children constitute a chunk of the workforce in the informal and home based sectors. Poor working conditions, hazardous work environment and nominal wages are unpleasant features of these sectors. The workers cannot form unions. With shrinking boundaries, trade unions find it difficult to raise the voice for this unorganized segment of workforce which is confronted with a number of problems, like, job insecurity, deprivation from legal benefits, non-provision of labour rights, poor wages and lack of social protection. The study underpins that the role of Government under new setup has been restricted to that of a facilitator rather than a regulator. The labour laws, being outdated and voluminous, do not fulfill the requirements of modern times. The inspection under labour laws has not taken abreast with the developments of globalization. The study through two case studies of Saga Sports and Irfan Garments, has also analyzed the impacts of the policies of MNCs on the workers attached to the export sector industries. MNCs have their own company codes for their vendors to abide by. They have their own compliance mechanism to monitor the implementation through third party validation. The research establishes that {{in the absence of an}} efficient national inspection mechanism compliance of these company codes does not provide a long term solution to ensure provision of labour rights and social protection to all who work. The thesis has examined various policies, like, Labour Policy, 2002, National Policy and Plan of Action to Combat Child Labour, National Policy and Plan of <b>Action</b> <b>for</b> <b>Rehabilitation</b> of Freed Bonded Labourers, Labour Protection Policy, 2005, Labour Inspection Policy, 2006, and Labour Policy, 2010. It has also analyzed the reports of the Commission on simplification, rationalization and consolidation of labour laws and a Task Force for labour levies. The study in this context has found out that the real fruits of these policies have not been transmitted to the working class due to lack of capacity and poor implementation. The study has also highlighted the challenges being confronted by the policy makers and enforcement agencies in the wake of Eighteenth Constitutional Amendment and concluded that after abolition of the Concurrent Legislative List and transfer of mandate to legislate on labour to the provinces, their responsibilities have increased manifold. While legislating, they will have to ensure coverage for the uncovered and effective implementation of these laws. Special attention should be given to the workers of informal sector, contract labour, piece-rated, women labour and home based workers. At the same time, the Federal Government in consultation with the provinces may develop bare minimum standards which provinces should follow during legislation and implementation of labour laws. As a way forward, the study has recommended a complete overhauling of social protection schemes, special focus on elimination of child labour, particularly, of its worst forms and abolition of bonded labour. It has also recommended promotion of healthy trade union activities by allowing right of association to the workers of unorganized sectors, encouraging social dialogue, improving occupational safety and health (OSH) at the workplace, special measures for lady workers and a vibrant policy of human resource development to meet the challenges of international market...|$|E

Almous all of these historic famous bridges are built out of stone and appart from having their basic purpose, they also have historic and cultural value, so because of that they are renovated very often. Bridge-building in Slovenia expanded and became more frequent when the country began with the building of highways (first highway was on relation Vrhnika – Postojna, oppened in 1972) and from that point, began the building of lots of bridge-like objects (viaducts, underpasses, overpasses etc.). If we look at the material, most of those bridges and viaducts are reinforced concrete bridges. Given that these structures are exposed to a lot of external influences all the time, a lot of damadges appear, which is a reason for them to be mantained reggulary.

40|$|Efficient {{operations}} of highways are inevitably {{critical for the}} sustainable, fast and safe transportation of people and freight. Effective maintenance in particular is of primary importance for ensuring that a highway meets operational and safety standards and offers efficient services to its users. Road surface or pavement maintenance comprises of required <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> planning <b>rehabilitation</b> strategies and maintenance activities over a highway network, having as an objective to keep the network in an acceptable functional and structural condition. Therefore, pavement condition assessment and prediction of deterioration become mandatory prerequisites for deciding on maintenance programming and budget allocation. Improved models of that category would better decisions on maintenance activities and allocation of resources. In this context, this PhD research focuses {{on the development of}} novel, efficient models for assessing existing condition and predicting future damage of pavements. Particular research efforts include introduction of an approach for assessing existing pavement condition, as well as the development of new post-treatment pavement deterioration models. New tools and methods are developed for that purpose: first, a new method for assessing existing pavement structural health, using the dynamic stiffness modulus is introduced and evaluated. Next, a Bayesian duration based model is developed in an effort to predict remaining service life of pavements, following rehabilitation actions. A subsequent model is developed for forecasting asphalt cracking initiation, again following maintenance activities; this model is based on Artificial Neural networks. Explanatory parameters are identified in all models; these include treatment activities, weather and structural characteristics of pavements. A qualitative comparison of BDM and ANN techniques reveals conceptual differences: BDM refers to the temporal behavior of pavement deterioration while attempts to forecast the probability of deterioration given a set of inputs. On the other hand, the quantitative comparison yields strong statistical similarities between the outcomes of the two models, with respect to estimating post treatment deterioration timing...|$|R
