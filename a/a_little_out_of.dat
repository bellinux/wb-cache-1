5|$|As to Captain Benbow, I {{know of no}} {{difference}} between him and me, nor have we had any. He has no small obligation to me, but being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put him <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> himself, and has made him play the fool, as I guess, in some of his letters. I will not farther now particularize this business, but time will show I have not been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.|$|E
5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] {{talks about}} Aguilera {{adopting}} a new persona and new musical experiments. At the beginning, Aguilera admits that [...] "Tonight I'm feeling <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control". At the pre-chorus, she sings [...] "The old me's gone and I feel brand new, {{and if you}} don't like it, fuck you", which takes aim at anyone who dismisses her new style; meanwhile, she declares her musical departure from her previous 1940s and 1950s inspired album Back to Basics (2006) at the chorus with the line, [...] "I'm not myself tonight, tonight I'm not the same girl". The song also evokes sexual theme, with lyrics such as [...] "I'm dancin' a lot, I'm takin' shots and I'm feelin' fine/ I'm kissin' all the boys and girls". Writing for Billboard magazine, Michael Menachem opined that Aguilera channeled a [...] "more 'Euro-glamorous' version" [...] of her previous alter ego [...] "Xtina", featured in her 2002 hit [...] "Dirrty" [...] from Stripped.|$|E

500|$|In Paris, Ahmadzaï worked obsessively to {{complete}} the recording of [...] "Impressive Instant", applying his characteristic sound mangling. He used the Antares Auto-Tune plug-in set for the pitch correction. Explaining that the audio processor kept the characteristic of the voice, he recalled that Madonna was not afraid to use it, unlike other artists; she just had to sing <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> tune and vibrato. The song had LFO sweeps at its beginning, panning from its left and right, which created {{the backdrop of the}} track. To achieve this, Ahmadzaï used a Nord Lead synthesizer, passed through an audio filter. The bass used in the song was subdued, and did not contain any music in high or mid-range. Instead of using a Minimoog synthesizer, Ahmadzaï used a Korg Prophecy analog-modelling synthesizer which added a different texture to the song. Audio filters were used for the first appearance of a melody and Madonna's voice was processed through an Eventide 3000 harmonizer, finally adding effects from filters and E6400 emulator. Also, Ahmadzaï added his characteristic stuttering sounds to the song, explaining: ...|$|E
500|$|During early development, Rocksteady {{placed a}} {{prototype}} Batmobile {{in the existing}} Arkham City map, and learned that the claustrophobic city designed for Batman to glide and grapple did not work well for driving a vehicle. Gotham City was thus redesigned with wider streets to allow space for the Batmobile and other street traffic to drive without colliding into walls, and buildings were made taller to accommodate the vehicle's ejection ability. To redesign Gotham City, the designers attempted {{to build on the}} previous games' gothic architecture while making a more believable and dense city. Alongside minor elements like neon lights, billboard advertising, and American-style cars, the team developed ideas for shops that could be found in the city, while retaining a grimy, dystopian theme. Describing the design, Hego said: [...] "every kind of element we've added in there ... makes the entire experience feel <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> time. You couldn't pinpoint whether it's twenty years ago, now or in ten years time." [...] The designers valued making an open world that was [...] "rich, vibrant, dense...and full of interesting things to do" [...] over it just being large.|$|E
500|$|... "Don't You Wanna Stay" [...] {{was covered}} by Colton Dixon and Skylar Laine in the {{eleventh}} season of American Idol. Natalie Finn of E! gave a mixed review of the pair's performance, writing [...] "Skylar handled Kelly Clarkson better than Colton played Jason Aldean on [...] "Don't You Wanna Stay," [...] but she's the country girl, so it made sense." [...] Brian Mansfield of USA Today felt that the song was out of Dixon's comfort zone and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Laine's range. Gil Kaufman of MTV remarked that the chemistry between the pair was more like cold fusion. Jennifer Still of Digital Spy said the performance [...] "isn't anything incredible". [...] "Don't You Wanna Stay" [...] was performed by Justin Chain and Shelbie Z in the fifth season of The Voice during the Battle Rounds which was first aired on October 14, 2013. Natasha Chandel of MTV opined that the pair struggled with their pitch and harmonies during rehearsals but successfully stepped up their game during the live performance. A similar view was shared by Ashley Lee of The Hollywood Reporter writing, [...] "Throughout rehearsals, neither the motorcycle accident survivor nor the pageant coach could lock in their harmonies during the choruses [...] They ended up blending well onstage.|$|E

500|$|American {{songwriter}} {{and producer}} Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart convened with Terius [...] "The-Dream" [...] Nash and Kuk Harrell in January 2007 at the Atlanta-based Triangle Studios {{to create new}} material. In the studio, Stewart was [...] "messing around with a walloping hi-hat sound", which he found in the free music software GarageBand, which is included in all Mac computers. With his attention caught by the sound, Nash asked Stewart what he was doing: [...] "Oh, my Gosh, what is that beat?". When Stewart incorporated chords onto the hi-hat, [...] "immediately the word popped into [...] head"; {{he went to the}} vocal booth and started singing. Nash wrote the first two verses and the chorus over Stewart's skeleton track. They quickly wrote the lyrics, completing the first verse in 60 seconds. They continued into writing, adding the hook while [...] " [...] would put the next chord". In a matter of hours, they had recorded a demo of the track. The song was written with American pop singer Britney Spears in mind, whom Stewart had previously worked with on her 2003 single [...] "Me Against the Music". Stewart and Nash thought that Spears, who had [...] "her personal life... <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control" [...] at the time, needed a hit as musical comeback. Spears was working on her fifth album, Blackout, so they sent a copy of the demo to Spears' management. However, Spears did not hear of the song because her label rejected it, claiming they had enough songs for her to record.|$|E
500|$|Writer Novak {{cites the}} episode as the [...] "most conceptually ambitious" [...] in the show's history. More {{than half the}} episode {{consisted}} of footage from the film. Originally, the producers considered showing just the movie, but they felt that it [...] "would feel like a gimmick or experiment", {{and so it was}} decided that the film would be intercut with shots of the office reacting to the film. In order to make the film seem as if Michael had created it, the film used was colorized in post-production to make it seem as if it were of a cheaper quality than the normal high-quality film that the series used. Certain shooting methods, like hand-held and zooms, were nixed, except for in cases where they could be presented in a [...] "poorly-executed" [...] manner. This was done in a way to make it appear that Michael at least knew what he was doing; Novak explained that the crew [...] "didn't want the joke of the episode to be how bad he was at filmmaking" [...] because it would [...] "be a little easy and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> character". To create the fake dummy of Toby that exploded, Paul Lieberstein was required to spend several hours in a full-face mold that reportedly [...] "unnerved him greatly". Two molds were taken. Both were filled with explosives, but one was filled with fake blood. Both were shot with slow-motion cameras. However, the dummy with the fake blood in it was considered [...] "too disturbing for us and arguably too disturbing for Michael", and so the tamer explosion was used.|$|E
500|$|... "No Church in the Wild" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics and was {{often described as}} a highlight from Watch the Throne. Andy Gill of The Independent stated [...] "the best track is surely the opener 'No Church in the Wild', whose deep, detuned twang groove, over a marching organ motif, is the most striking music on the album, promising rather more {{than the rest of}} the record is able to deliver. Both this and the other stand-out track, [...] "Made In America", feature assured vocal refrains from Frank Ocean, while the two rappers muse over familiar themes of loyalty, sexuality and maternal solidarity." [...] Rolling Stone claims that it is one of the most musically impressive songs on Watch the Throne and describes the production as an [...] "ominous, darkly funky bass groove and chilly synths tailor-made for Ocean's off-kilter crooning." [...] Matt Popkin from American Songwriter praised Jay Z's verse and the menacing vibe of the song. NOW claims that [...] "uncomfortably visceral opener 'No Church In The Wild' – with its filthy Phil Manzanera guitar sample and mournful Frank Ocean chorus – cuts to the heart of Watch The Throne's power dynamic." [...] However, PopMatters criticized that the verses [...] "feel <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> focus compared to the hook and beat's opulence." [...] Sputnikmusic's Tyler Fisher commented [...] "88-Keys creates a positively epic opening track with 'No Church in the Wild', full of creeping guitar riffs and pulsating bass, building tension that simply never releases." [...] Rolling Stone named the track the sixth best song of the year, reporting that [...] "with Hov and Yeezy getting deep into arcane theology, this track is just another high." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the army}} Dundas was nicknamed [...] "Old Pivot" [...] for his Prussian-style drill books.

2500|$|David Lardner of The New Yorker {{offered a}} similar opinion, writing {{that for most}} of the film Davis [...] "just plods along with the plot, which is longish and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{proportion}} to its intellectual content." [...] Variety, however, wrote a more positive review, calling it [...] "the kind of drama that maintains Warner's pattern for boxoffice success ... Hal Wallis hasn't spared the purse-strings on this production. It has all the earmarks of money spent wisely. Irving Rapper's direction has made the picture move along briskly, and the cast, down to the most remote performer, has contributed grade A portrayals."

[...] In 1929, a newspaper reporter recalled Heston's running style as follows:"A strong arm helped Willie, Sr., to move 'em. After cracking through that line the old arm would go out. [...] You can still pick out men who used to play football against Michigan in '02 and '03, they say, because their faces seem just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> kilter.

2500|$|The Mark III, {{introduced}} in March 1967, {{was the first}} major facelift to the Spitfire. The front bumper was raised in response to new crash regulations, as well as the front coil springs being slightly raised, which made the car sometimes look <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> proportion. Although much of the bonnet pressing was carried over, the front end looked quite different. The rear lost the overriders from the bumper but gained reversing lights as standard (initially as two separate lights {{on either side of the}} number plate, latterly as a single light in a new unit above the number plate); the interior was improved again with a wood-veneer instrument surround and a smaller 15-inch wire spoked steering wheel. A folding hood replaced the earlier [...] "build it yourself" [...] arrangement. For most of the Mark III range, the instrument cluster was still centre-mounted (as in the Mark I and Mark II) so as to reduce parts bin counts (and thereby production costs) for right-hand and left-hand drive versions.|$|E

[...] "But as you go, you realize they're not quite as important this time of year. Physically, I feel good. Early in the spring, I felt pretty decent at the plate.
