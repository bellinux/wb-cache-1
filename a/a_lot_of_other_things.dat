500|$|Xhinovci {{has come}} to believe that he is Hitler reincarnated since he began {{dressing}} as the Nazi leader. He carries numerous pieces of Nazi paraphernalia around with him, including Nazi-era Reichsmarks, swastika-emblazoned buttons, scarves embroidered with swastikas and other Nazi imagery, as well as a copy of Mein Kampf. He has business cards featuring a swastika and the word [...] "Hitler" [...] printed in bold. Locals and peacekeepers alike do not seem to mind Xhinovci's Hitler impersonations, especially as many Kosovars are too preoccupied with the country's crippling poverty and rampant corruption to give his actions much thought. On the contrary, many passersby—including some NATO peacekeepers—stop and greet him with the Nazi salute. One local told Vice News: [...] "I have <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> to worry about in my life. I might look at him if he walks by, but that's it." [...] Locals apparently believe that his way of earning a living [...] "shows great enterprise". [...] "People respect me," [...] Xhinovci explains. [...] "The young and old [...] men, women and children. Everyone greets me with [...] "Heil Hitler". Xhinovci's five daughters, referred to locally as [...] "Hitler's children", are not bothered by their father's Hitler impersonations. Xhinovci reportedly attends parent-teacher conferences dressed as Hitler and says that teachers and other parents do not mind his appearance. He says that every time he goes to pick his daughters up from school he is surrounded by children who want to talk with him and take pictures. [...] "Girls like to touch my face. They think it's a mask. They pull my hair and ask if they can kiss me on the face. When I'm out of the house with my family, people stop to talk to me. But my wife is not a jealous person—she doesn't mind." ...|$|E

Wilkinson chalked up his personal success in life to his national championship season with Utah as a freshman. [...] "Anything like that gives you more confidence {{to do other things}} in life," [...] he says. [...] "You think, Gee, if we won the NCAAs and weren't expected to, we could probably do <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> we didn't think we could do." ...|$|E
2500|$|In music, the Scottish post-rock band Mogwai {{are named}} after the film's creatures: as for {{the reason for the}} band chose this as their name, their guitarist, Stuart Braithwaite, has stated that [...] "it has no {{significant}} meaning and we always intended on getting a better one, but like <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> we never got round to it".

2500|$|Leno {{himself was}} among O'Brien's harshest critics, calling O'Brien's numbers [...] "destructive to the franchise" [...] despite O'Brien's {{success in the}} advertiser-friendly {{demographics}} combined with his significantly smaller salary compared to Leno's pointing to profitability. In fact, Leno's comment was in stark contrast with his own assessment of O'Brien's performance {{less than three months}} prior: [...] "Personally, I think Conan is doing fine. He's beating Dave in the demo, maybe not in the popular one right now because Dave has <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> going that have people watching for whatever reason, so I think that's not really a fair thing. It's a little too early to tell".|$|E
2500|$|The Super Bowl {{controversy}} {{was also}} a subject of humor {{on all of the}} late-night talk shows. For example, CBS's own Late Show with David Letterman mocked the incident all week following the Super Bowl. Host David Letterman jokingly commented on the controversy the day after the Super Bowl that he [...] "was happy to see this thing happen... because that meant for one night I wasn't the biggest boob on CBS". The next day, he also joked that President George W. Bush formed a [...] "Department of Wardrobe Security" [...] to prevent further wardrobe malfunctions. On February 4, Letterman opened his monologue by joking about having a wardrobe malfunction. Additionally, the Top Ten Lists featured on the program on that same night briefly referenced the incident. Jackson's appearance on the Late Show the following month increased the show's ratings 20% from the program's usual weeknight opener. Larry King also stated Jackson jokingly gave him a pair of suspenders with open holes around the nipples, commenting [...] "I wore them once, they were cute." [...] Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean called the FCC's investigation [...] "silly", commenting [...] "In general, I think the FCC does have a role in promoting some reasonable standard of decency. However, considering what's on television these days, I think the FCC is being pretty silly about investigating this." [...] Dean added [...] "I don't find it terribly shocking relative to {{some of the things you}} can find on standard cable television. I think the FCC probably has <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> they should be pursuing." ...|$|E
