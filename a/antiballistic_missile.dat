With upgrades to their AN/SPY-1 phased radar systems and their associated missile payloads {{as part of the}} Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, the ships of this class have also begun to demonstrate some promise as mobile <b>antiballistic</b> <b>missile</b> and anti-satellite weaponry platforms. Some versions of the class no longer have the towed sonar, or Harpoon missile launcher. Their hull and superstructure were designed to have a reduced radar cross section.|$|E
40|$|The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is {{beginning}} to fracture. Its members, sharing the triumphalism that underpinned U. S. foreign policy after the Cold War, took on burdens that have proved more difficult than expected. Increasingly, they are failing {{to meet the challenges}} confronting them. The principal problem is Afghanistan. After the United States was attacked on September 11, 2001, NATO for the first time invoked Article V, its pledge that an attack against one member country would be considered an attack against all. But NATO's forces are being relentlessly attacked by the Taliban, and among NATO countries popular support for maintaining troops there is fading. If NATO fails in Afghanistan, the consequences could be as damaging for its survival as the Vietnam War was for the now defunct Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. There {{are a number of other}} problems, which may not reach the importance of Afghanistan, but which nevertheless pose serious complications. These include the proposed deployment of <b>antiballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> in Poland and the Czech Republic; a potential flashpoint in Kosovo, where the Albanian majority's insistence on independence could divide alliance members; and the growing tension between Russia and some of its neighbors. NATO's inability to deter a cyber attack that virtually paralyzed NATO member Estonia's access to the internet [...] an attack evidently launched from Russia but without any clear link to the Russian government [...] raises questions about the alliance's ability to protect its newest members. In short, NATO is facing new challenges, and the future of the alliance is unclear. The United States should begin discussions with our allies about what a post-NATO world would look like...|$|R
25|$|The Soviet Union {{developed}} {{a new series of}} long-range missiles, called the SS-9 (NATO codename Scarp). A question developed concerning the extent of their capability to carry nuclear weapons; at issue was whether the missile were a Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) or not. The CIA information was that these missiles were not 'MIRVed' but Defense intelligence considered that they were of the more potent kind. If so, the Soviet Union was possibly aiming at a first strike nuclear capacity. The Nixon administration, desiring to employ the existence of such Soviet threat to justify a new American <b>antiballistic</b> <b>missile</b> system, publicly endorsed the Defense point of view. Henry Kissinger, Nixon's national security advisor, asked Helms to review the CIA's finding, yet Helms initially stood by his analysts at CIA. Eventually, however, Helms compromised.|$|E
25|$|During the Cold War, many Livermore-designed warheads entered service. These {{were used}} in {{missiles}} {{ranging in size from}} the Lance surface-to-surface tactical missile to the megaton-class Spartan <b>antiballistic</b> <b>missile.</b> Over the years, LLNL designed the following warheads: W27 (Regulus cruise missile; 1955; joint with Los Alamos), W38 (Atlas/Titan ICBM; 1959), B41 (B52 bomb; 1957), W45 (Little John/Terrier missiles; 1956), W47 (Polaris SLBM; 1957), W48 (155-mm howitzer; 1957), W55 (submarine rocket; 1959), W56 (Minuteman ICBM; 1960), W58 (Polaris SLBM; 1960), W62 (Minuteman ICBM; 1964), W68 (Poseidon SLBM; 1966), W70 (Lance missile; 1969), W71 (Spartan missile; 1968), W79 (8-in. artillery gun; 1975), W82 (155-mm howitzer; 1978), B83 (modern strategic bomb; 1979), and W87 (Peacekeeper/MX ICBM; 1982). The W87 and the B83 are the only LLNL designs still in the U.S. nuclear stockpile.|$|E
500|$|Operation Sandblast {{also proved}} nuclear-powered {{submarines}} could undertake extended operations independent of any external support. Specifically, Triton tested a prototype ship inertial navigational system (SINS) for submarine use, {{as well as}} being the first submarine to test the floating very low frequency (VLF) communications buoy system, with both systems being vital for the Navy's upcoming Polaris fleet ballistic missile submarines (FBM) deterrence patrols. Finally, the psychological testing of Tritons crew members {{to determine the effects of}} long-term isolation was particularly relevant for the initial deployment of the Navy's fleet ballistic missile submarines, as well as NASA's upcoming manned space program, Project Mercury, with MIT engineers assuring NASA [...] "that getting to the moon and back was simpler than guiding an <b>antiballistic</b> <b>missile</b> or circumnavigating the earth under water in a nuclear submarine." ...|$|E

[...] Shortly after Nixon's statement the United States and the Soviet Union began the SALT arms control talks, which eventually resulted in nuclear arms controls as well as the 1972 <b>Antiballistic</b> <b>Missile</b> Treaty. The U.S. commitment to end BW programs helped provide the lead for ongoing talks led by the United Kingdom in Geneva. The Eighteen Nation Disarmament Committee was discussing a British draft of a biological weapons treaty which the United Nations General Assembly approved in 1968 and that NATO supported. These arms control talks would eventually lead to the Biological Weapons Convention, an international treaty outlawing biological warfare.|$|E

50|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{the term}} meant defense against {{strategic}} (usually nuclear-armed) missiles.
