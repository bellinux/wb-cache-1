Neural mappings (in {{contrast to}} neural pathways) store training information by adjusting their neural link weights (see <b>artificial</b> <b>neuron,</b> artificial neural networks). Neural mappings {{are capable of}} generating or activating a distributed representation (see above) of a sensory or motor state within a sensory or motor map from a punctual or local activation within the other map (see for example the synaptic projection from speech sound map to motor map, to auditory target region map, or to somatosensory target region map in the DIVA model, explained below; or see for example the neural mapping from phonetic map to auditory state map and motor plan state map in the ACT model, explained below and Fig. 3).|$|E
2500|$|Each neuron (model cell, <b>artificial</b> <b>neuron)</b> {{within the}} speech sound map can be {{activated}} and subsequently activates a forward motor command towards the motor map, called articulatory velocity and position map. The activated neural representation [...] {{on the level}} of that motor map determines the articulation of a speech unit, i.e. controls all articulators (lips, tongue, velum, glottis) during the time interval for producing that speech unit. Forward control also involves subcortical structures like the cerebellum, not modelled in detail here.|$|E

Each speech unit (mainly syllables; e.g. the syllable and word [...] "palm" [...] /pam/, the syllables /pa/, /ta/, /ka/, ...) is represented by a specific model cell within the speech sound map (i.e. punctual neural representations, see above).

50|$|Ultimately, {{biological}} neuron models aim {{to explain}} the mechanisms underlying {{the operation of the}} nervous system for the purpose of restoring lost control capabilities such as perception (e.g. deafness or blindness), motor movement decision making, and continuous limb control. In that sense, biological neural models differ from <b>artificial</b> <b>neuron</b> models that do not presume to predict the outcomes of experiments involving the biological neural tissue (although <b>artificial</b> <b>neuron</b> models are also concerned with execution of perception and estimation tasks).

5000|$|An <b>artificial</b> <b>neuron</b> is a {{mathematical}} function {{conceived as a}} model of biological neurons, a neural network. Artificial neurons are elementary units in an artificial neural network. The <b>artificial</b> <b>neuron</b> receives one or more inputs (representing dendrites) and sums them to produce an output (or [...] ) (representing a neuron's axon). Usually the sums of each node are weighted, and the sum is passed through a non-linear function known as an activation function or transfer function. The transfer functions usually have a sigmoid shape, but they may also take the form of other non-linear functions, piecewise linear functions, or step functions. They are also often monotonically increasing, continuous, differentiable and bounded. The thresholding function has inspired to build logic gates referred to as threshold logic; with a renewed interest to build logic circuits resembling brain processing. For example, new devices such as memristors have been extensively used to develop such logic in recent times.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike most <b>artificial</b> <b>neurons,</b> however, {{biological}} neurons fire in discrete pulses.

The rate (activations per second, etc.) at which an axon fires converts directly into {{the rate at which}} neighboring cells get signal ions introduced into them. The faster a biological neuron fires, the faster nearby neurons accumulate electrical potential (or lose electrical potential, depending on the [...] "weighting" [...] of the dendrite that connects to the neuron that fired).
