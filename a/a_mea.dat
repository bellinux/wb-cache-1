50|$|One {{solution}} to this problem involves growing cells on <b>an</b> <b>MEA</b> inside <b>a</b> sealed chamber. This chamber serves as a non-humidified incubator that is enclosed by a fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) membrane that is permeable to select gases (i.e. gases necessary for metabolism) but impermeable to water and microbes. Other solutions entail an incubator with an impermeable membrane that has a specific mix of gases (air with 5% CO2 is typical) sealed inside.|$|R
40|$|The Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) {{fuel cell}} {{is an ideal}} {{emerging}} alternative power source for transportation; however, before PEM fuel cells’ widespread use, a number of technical challenges need to be overcome, including durability which is mainly associated with three factors: mechanical, electrochemical, and thermal degradation. Among them, mechanical degradation {{is of paramount importance}} because it causes a gradual reduction of mechanical strength, toughness and, ultimately, cell performance decay. Yet, studies focusing on the mechanical degradation of MEAs and its impact on cell performance decay are relatively scarce. This thesis focuses on the early and late stages of mechanical degradation of <b>an</b> <b>MEA</b> in <b>a</b> PEM fuel cell. In the experimental phase, scanning electron microscope (SEM) tests detailed the initial microstructures and their changes in <b>an</b> <b>MEA</b> before and after accelerated durability testing. The possibility that large stresses, including clamping forces and hygro-thermal stresses, were the reason behind these structural changes, necessitated further studies of stress conditions in the <b>MEA</b> using <b>a</b> structure model. Techniques used to characterize the mechanical properties of gas diffusion layers (GDLs) and of catalyst layers included a microcompression tester and the nanoindentation technique. These mechanical properties guided the selection of constitutive relations in the modelling. In the modelling phase, a structure model clarified the stress and deformation of MEAs during common and cyclic operating conditions. A variety of constitutive models enabled the simulation of different materials in cells. <b>A</b> deformed <b>MEA</b> determined from the structure model enabled a more realistic method to study the cell performance under early and late stages of mechanical degradation. Results revealed that MEA’s early mechanical degradation, which is related with operating conditions, assembly methods and channel designs, had a complex effect on transport phenomenon. In addition, since <b>an</b> <b>MEA’s</b> early degradation is associated with durability, the selection of operating conditions, assembly methods and channel designs should balance both cell performance and durability. Under 2000 cyclic changes in operating conditions, the cell performance decreases about 8 % merely with the mechanical degradation. Therefore, in order to increase the life span of a PEM fuel cell, it is important to find an effective approach to relief the mechanical degradation...|$|R

30|$|Menorrhagia is {{a common}} {{clinical}} condition that accounts {{for most of the}} hysterectomies performed [5]. In England alone, over 40, 000 hysterectomies are done each year [6], and overall in the United Kingdom {{it has been estimated that}} each woman has a 10 % chance of having one by age 43 [7]. DUB is diagnosed when a woman suffers from abnormal uterine bleeding, usually menorrhagia during the reproductive years, that is unrelated to structural uterine abnormalities. Since its introduction in 1994 as a treatment for DUB, MEA has been widely studied in laboratory and clinical settings and is now regarded as an easy, efficacious technique with a low complication rate [8]. The technique involves delivery of high-frequency (9.2 GHz) microwaves into the uterine cavity using <b>an</b> <b>MEA</b> applicator, which destroys the uterine endometrium up to a depth of 5 – 6 mm, thereby reducing the menstrual blood flow [9]. Microwave energy to the MEA applicator is generated in <b>an</b> <b>MEA</b> control unit. This control unit has a microwave generator, a control module with an embedded microprocessor, and a user touch screen with a colour display [15].|$|R
40|$|Previous {{authors have}} shown that the {{asymptotic}} capacity of a multiple element antenna (MEA) system with transmit and receive antennas (termed <b>an</b> <b>MEA)</b> grows linearly with indices differ by if, for all, the correlation of the fading for two antenna elements whose remains fixed as antennas are added to the array. However, in practice, the total size of the array is often fixed, and thus the correlation of the fading for two elements separated in index by some value will change as the number of antenna elements is increased. In this paper, under the condition that the size of an array of antennas is fixed, and assuming that the transmitter does not have access to the channel state information (CSI) while the receiver has perfect CSI, the asymptotic properties of the instantaneous mutual information <b>an</b> <b>MEA</b> wireless system in a quasi-static fading channel are derived analytically and tested for accuracy for finite through simulations. For many channel correlation structures, it is demonstrated that the asymptotic performance converges almost surely, implying that such <b>MEA</b> systems have <b>a</b> certain strong robustness to the instantiation of the channel fading values...|$|R

A closed-loop stimulus-response system has also been constructed using <b>an</b> <b>MEA</b> by Dr. Potter, Dr. Mandhavan, and Dr. DeMarse, and by Mark Hammond, Kevin Warwick, and Ben Whalley in the University of Reading.
