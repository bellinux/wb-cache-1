50|$|Metal phosphides {{have been}} used as a means of killing rodents and are {{considered}} single-dose fast acting rodenticides (death occurs commonly within 1-3 days after single bait ingestion). A bait consisting of food and a phosphide (usually zinc phosphide) is left where the rodents can eat it. The acid in the digestive system of the rodent reacts with the phosphide to generate the toxic phosphine gas. This method of vermin control has possible use in places where rodents are resistant to some of the anticoagulants, particularly for control of house and field mice; zinc phosphide baits are also cheaper than most second-generation anticoagulants, so that sometimes, in the case of large infestation by rodents, their population is initially reduced by copious amounts of zinc phosphide bait applied, and the rest of population that survived the initial fast-acting poison is then eradicated by prolonged feeding on <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>bait.</b> Inversely, the individual rodents, that survived <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>bait</b> poisoning (rest population) can be eradicated by pre-baiting them with nontoxic bait {{for a week or two}} (this is important to overcome bait shyness, and to get rodents used to feeding in specific areas by specific food, especially in eradicating rats) and subsequently applying poisoned bait of the same sort as used for pre-baiting until all consumption of the bait ceases (usually within 2-4 days). These methods of alternating rodenticides with different modes of action gives actual or almost 100% eradications of the rodent population in the area, if the acceptance/palatability of baits are good (i.e., rodents feed on it readily).|$|E

Should it successfully disperse to mainland Florida, it could continue spreading through much of North America where significant negative ecological and agricultural consequences could result. We rapidly developed the information for implementing an efficient and successful eradication program before dispersal to the mainland occurs. This included development of monitoring and indexing methods and their application to define the animal’s range, the development of baits attractive to Gambian giant pouched rats, efficacy testing of toxicants, and development of bait-delivery devices that exclude native animals. Gambian giant pouched rats appeared confined to the western two-thirds of Grassy Key, but have dispersed across a soil-filled causeway west to Crawl Key.

40|$|AbstractOnce rats have invaded farm buildings, {{efficient}} rat control {{usually requires}} {{the application of}} rodenti-cides. Efficacy of control measures may be lost by physiological resistance to anticoagulant rodenticides and by behavioural reactions of the target rat population. On a farm within the area of anticoagulant resistance in north-west Germany, two consecutive rodenticide treatments were carried out against rats, using different <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>bait</b> preparations. Bait consumption was monitored in combination with direct individual video-monitoring of bait uptake behaviour. Almost half of the rats survived the first three-week treatment using coumatetralyl bait. This result was ascribed to the high overall degree of anticoagulant resistance prevailing in the rat population. The second treatment of the same population using difenacoum bait totally failed to reduce population numbers. Dietary preferences, neophobia, social interactions and habitat structure are important behavioural parameters determining bait uptake. They are discussed {{in relation to the}} results of the treatment and a conceptual model for the factors determining rodent control efficacy is presented. The combined results of the two monitoring techniques applied demonstrate the significance of resistance and bait uptake behaviour for the efficacy of rat control measures and suggest the need for adapted rat-control strategies to reduce hygienic problems and the risk of non-target poisoning hazards for livestock and wildlife. This can be achieved if the choices of bait base and active ingredient as well as the methods of bait positioning are adapted to the behavioural peculiarities of the rats and the specific structural conditions on each farm...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Rodenticides {{are often}} {{included}} {{as part of}} an integrated pest management approach for managing pocket gophers (Thomomys spp.) given that they are relatively quick and inexpensive to apply. Strychnine has historically been the most effective toxicant for pocket gophers, but its use is currently limited in the United States; alternative registered toxicants have not proven effective. Recent research with baits containing cholecalciferol plus anticoagulant toxicants proved effective against pocket gophers in a lab setting. Therefore, we established a field study to compare cholecalciferol plus anticoagulant combinations [0. 03 % cholecalciferol plus 0. 005 % diphacinone (C+D), 0. 015 % cholecalciferol plus 0. 0025 % brodifacoum (C+B 1), 0. 03 % cholecalciferol plus 0. 0025 % brodifacoum (C+B 2) ] with strychnine (0. 5 %) for pocket gopher management. RESULTS: Strychnine treatments resulted in 100 %efficacy after two treatment periods. Both C+DandC+B 2 resulted in efficacy significantly greater than 70 % after two treatment periods (83 and 75 % respectively). Efficacy from C+B 1 (85 %) was not significantly greater than 70 %, but did yield high overall efficacy as well. CONCLUSION: Although strychnine remains the most effective rodenticide for pocket gopher control, the cholecalciferol plus <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>baits</b> tested would be a good alternative when strychnine is unavailable. C+Dmay be the best option given that it uses a first-generation anticoagulant as the synergist...|$|R

40|$|The {{mountain}} beaver (Aplodontia rufa) is a fossorialrodent species endemic to the Pacific Northwest and portions of California. This herbivore inflicts {{millions of dollars}} of damage annually to forest seedling plantations. Currently, extensive trapping prior to planting is the most reliable method for reducing damage. With increasing restrictions placed on trapping, forest resource managers need alternative tools to minimize forest damage. This study assessed the potential of four toxicants registered for underground use to control{{mountain beaver}}; zinc phosphide, diphacinone, chlorophacinone, and strychnine. Zinc phosphide and strychnine are acute toxicants, whereas diphacinone and chlorophacinone are anticoagulants. Anticoagulants prevent the recycling of vitamin K in the body, which inhibits the production of clotting factors. Efficacy varied among treatments. Zinc phosphide and strychnine were avoided by mountain beaver. Pre-baiting marginally increased acceptance of strychnine, but did not alter mountain beaver acceptance of zinc phosphide. Diphacinone and chlorophacinone were both readily consumed, but only chlorophacinone was 100 % effective after a 14 -day baiting regime. Subsequently, we tested the effects of diet on the efficacy of diphacinone by varying the availability of food containing vitamin K, the anticoagulant antidote. Restricting access to potential sources of vitamin K appeared to increase efficacy. We conclude that anticoagulants hold some promise as additional tools for managers to reduce mountain beaver populations with chlorophacinone showing the most promise. However, limitations to <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>baits</b> include the necessity of long-term baiting (greater than 10 days), a possible decrease in toxicity if baits contact moisture, and potential primary hazards...|$|R
40|$|The {{black rat}} (Rattus rattus) causes severe damage to coconut (Cocos nucifera) crops in Colombia. These rodents {{climb to the}} crown of {{producing}} palms and often nest there. Damage results from the rats gnawing the shells of the coconuts until they penetrate to the endosperm; the perforated nuts will fall within a period of 15 days and are unsuitable for harvest. Since 1972, the Colombian Agricultural Research Institute (Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario or ICA), through its Vertebrate Control Program, has been conducting a series of investigations to obtain information about the characteristics of this damage and the best means of reducing it. Damage surveys {{in several of the}} principal coconut-producing areas reveal a high percentage of crop loss (e. g., Tumaco 20 %, San Andres Island - 34 %, and Gorgona Island - 60 %) and illustrate the seriousness of the problem. The lack of water (i. e., rainfall) during the dry season seems to be associated with increased damage. In some areas, such as San Andres, the planting density is excessively high. Hence, physical barriers such as metal bands on the trunk are ineffective [...] the proximity of the palms allows the rats to transit easily among adjacent trees on overlapping fronds. Our observations indicate that chemical control using <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>baits</b> placed in the palm crowns, significantly reduces damage. The effect of a single baiting can last up to six months, with the length of the effect dependent upon cultural practices implemented after treatment (e. g., maintaining cleanliness of area, weed control, etc.).

The techniques necessary for efficient use of the first-generation anticoagulants are often inappropriate, particularly in agriculture.

There are other problems, too, including widespread antithesis to prophylactic rodent control, perhaps in part due to the inherent low efficacy of acutes and the impractical nature (often leading to low efficacy) of first-generation <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>baiting</b> procedures.

Single applications are more effective than single applications of acute toxicants. Now used in agricultural and urban control programs, the technique is proving to be very cost-effective and highly acceptable, both to educated campaign organizers and uneducated users.

Any changes in feeding behaviour, survival, and bodyweight were recorded. Weta found Ditrac wax block baits palatable even in the presence of natural plant food, showing steady consumption of bait over time. No mortality or weight loss was attributable to the intake of Ditrac bait. All weta that ate bait had detectable diphacinone in their bodies, but did not accumulate diphacinone, i. e. whole-body concentrations did not increase with the amount of diphacinone bait eaten over time. Field use of diphacinone bait is likely to present a low risk of mortality to weta, but the risk posed by secondary diphacinone exposure to non-target species that eat weta requires further investigation. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R

The same baiting regime applied simultaneously in nearby stables with lower feed availability induced a significantly higher mean consumption of the cracked wheat based bait, and the activity index declined to zero at day 23, indicating that the rats were eradicated. The failure of the baits to control rats in the piggery was possibly due to the poor bait acceptance caused by the abundant feed supply. Results of live-trapping and radio- and spool-and-line tracking indicated that the population was confined within the piggery; lower windowsills were the most used above-ground structure for movements; and minimum home range span was 17 m. We suggest that rodent control should be implemented {{within the confines of the}} piggery to reduce the risk to non-target animals, and that mortality agents should be placed less than or equal to 17 in apart arboreally for the roof rat.

40|$|Invasive rodent species occupy {{more than}} 80 percent of island groups worldwide, with devastating impacts to native flora and fauna. Rodents prey on birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates, and {{indirectly}} effect native wildlife by destroying plants, competing for food, and transmitting disease. Species such as Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus), black rats (R. Rattus), and Polynesian rats (R. exulans) {{have caused the}} extinction of several species of native birds, mammals, and lizards (Atkinson 1985). For example, {{less than a decade}} after black rats were accidently introduced to Big South Cape Island in New Zealand in the early 1960 s, one bat species- the greater short-tailed bat (Mystacina robusta) - and five bird species, including the South Island snipe (Coenocorypha iredalei), went extinct (Bell 1978). To protect natural resources from rodents, biologists and landowners have typically applied <b>anticoagulant</b> rodenticides through <b>bait</b> stations. Though such stations can effectively eradicate rodents in small areas, they have not been feasible or effective in larger areas or on inaccessible islands. In 2005, USDA-APHIS Wildlife Services, in collaboration with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and two private companies, achieved a breakthrough in large-scale rodent eradication by developing and registering three new anticoagulant rodenticide products- Diphacinone 50 Conservation, Brodifacoum 25 W Conservation, and Brodifacoum 25 D Conservation- for broadcast application, both by hand or by air. To date, these products have helped successfully eradicate rodents from numerous islands in California, Florida, Alaska, Hawaii, and through the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Pribilof Islands. Once the rodents were gone, the recovery and restoration of wildlife on these islands has been dramatic...|$|R
