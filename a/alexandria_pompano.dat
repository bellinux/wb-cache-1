25|$|The African threadfish (Alectis alexandrina) (also {{known as}} the <b>Alexandria</b> <b>pompano)</b> is a species of large marine fish in the jack family, Carangidae. The species is {{distributed}} {{along the coast of}} tropical Africa in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, extending to the Mediterranean Sea. Adults live predominantly in shallow waters shallower than 70 m deep, often forming small schools. The African threadfish is similar in appearance to the closely related and co-occurring African pompano, with the slightly concave shape of the species head profile the most definitive feature of the species. Like other members of the genus Alectis, the juveniles of the species have long trailing dorsal and anal fins. The African threadfish is of minor commercial importance, and is also considered to be a game fish.|$|E
