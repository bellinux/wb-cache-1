40|$|Testicular biopsy {{findings}} in 100 infertile men {{were correlated with}} the clinical findings. Mild or moderately severe tubular lesions were seen in 57 cases and severe changes in 43. Clinical examination and semen analysis were no guide to {{the severity of the}} testicular lesion. Though patients with normal sized testes more commonly had mild tubular lesions, many were severe. Patients with small testes more often had severe lesions but some had only mild tubular changes. Biopsy {{findings in}} both <b>aspermic</b> and oligospermic patients ranged from normal to a complete loss of germinal tissue...|$|E
40|$|THE FINDINGS FROM SEMEN ANALYSIS WERE COMPARED WITH THE LEVEL OF SEXUAL FUNCTION, AS EVALUATED BY QUESTIONNAIRE, IN 12 MALE UREMIC PATIENTS, AGED 21 - 43 YEARS, WHO HAVE BEEN TREATED WITH REGULAR HEMODIALYSIS FOR 4 - 90 MONTHS. ABNORMAL FINDINGS FROM SEMEN ANALYSIS, RANGING FROM ASTHENOSPERMIA TO PERSISTENT ASPERMIA, WERE PRESENT IN ALL PATIENTS: 2 PATIENTS WERE <b>ASPERMIC,</b> 4 AZOOSPERMIC AND 5 OLIGOSPERMIC, WHILE IN ONE PATIENT SPERM COUNT WAS NORMAL BUT VIABILITY WAS POOR. TESTICULAR ATROPHY WAS PRESENT IN 4 OF THE SIX <b>ASPERMIC</b> - AZOOSPERMIC PATIENTS. TWO PATIENTS WERE IMPOTENT, 5 PATIENTS REPORTED A DECLINE INFREQUENCY OF INTERCOURSE BEGINNING AFTER INITIATION OF REGULAR HEMODIALYSIS AND 5 PATIENTS CLAIMED THAT THEY EXPERIENCED THE SAME LEVEL OF SEXUAL FUNCTION AS BEFORE ILLNESS. IN GENERAL, THE SEVERITY OF ABNORMALITIES FROM SEMEN ANALYSIS WAS ROUGHLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE DEGREE OF SEXUAL DISFUNCTION. LOW TESTOSTERONE LEVELS WERE FOUND IN 7 PATIENTS AND MEAN SERUM ZINC IN THE PATIENTS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN MEAN NORMAL VALUE. HOWEVER, NO CORRELATION EXISTED BETWEEN THE SEVERITY OF SEXUAL DISFUNCTION AND EITHER SERUM TESTOSTERONE OR SERUM ZINC LEVELS. ALSO, NO CORRELATION COULD BE FOUND BETWEEN THE DEGREE OF ABNORMALITIES FROM SEMEN ANALYSIS OR OF DERANGEMENT OF SEXUAL FUNCTION AND THE DURATION OF REGULAR HEMODIALYSIS TREATMENT. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT UREMIA PRODUCES A ROUGHLY PROPORTIONAL IMPAIRMENT OF SPERMATOGENIC AND INTERSTITIAL CELL FUNCTION OF THE TESTIS. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT A COMMON PATHOGENETIC MECHANISM RELATED TO UREMIA IS ACTING IN BOTH CASES. ...|$|E
40|$|Water {{restriction}} impaired sperm {{production in}} deer mice, a seasonally breeding mammal that encounters aperiodic droughts {{in its natural}} habitat throughout North America. Water-induced spermatogenic responses were sorted into three categories based upon epididymal sperm numbers: <b>aspermic,</b> oligospermic, and euspermic. Average gonadal mass was reduced after 10 wk of limited water consumption. Inter-individual variation in gonadal response to a simulated drought was similar to phenotypic differences in reproductive function in response to other environmental cues that direct annual reproductive cycles. Our findings suggest that water availability may act as a cue to suppress gametogenesis in deer mice independently from food, temperature, and day length...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{activation}} {{process in}} a variety of deuterostome and protostome eggs is accompanied by cytosolic calcium transients that usually take the form of either a single or multiple propagating waves. Here we report that the eggs of zebrafish (Danio rerio) are no exception in that they generate a single activation wave that traverses the egg at a velocity of around 9 μm/s. There appears, however, to be no difference between the calcium-mediated activation response of eggs with regard to {{the presence or absence of}} sperm in the spawning medium. This leads us to suggest that these eggs are normally activated when they come in contact with their spawning medium and are then subsequently fertilized. The <b>aspermic</b> wave is initiated at the animal pole in the region of the micropyle, appears to propagate mainly through the yolk-free egg cortex, and then terminates at the vegetal pole. As neither sperm nor external calcium is required for the initiation (or propagation) of the activation wave, this suggests that an alternative wave trigger must be involved...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{identification}} of <b>aspermic</b> Fasciola forms in Japan remains {{difficult because of}} their morphological variations. In order to characterize the forms genetically, nucleotide sequences of ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS 1 and ITS 2) and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and NADH dehydrogenase I (NDI) genes in 34 liver flukes from 16 prefectures in Japan were analysed. Two major forms represented by Fsp 1 and Fsp 2 had sequences identical to or closely resembling those of F. hepatica and F. gigantica, respectively, in all the 4 DNA markers and were mainly distributed in northern and eastern-western parts of Japan, respectively. Fsp 1 and Fsp 2 would have been introduced into Japan with infected cattle of 2 distinct lineages via the Korean Peninsula and spread through limited parts of Japan (northern and eastern-western parts) together with the movement of each cattle lineage. The Japanese form (Fsp 1 / 2), which showed heterozygosity in ribosomal DNA and Fsp 2 haplotype in mitochondrial DNA, may have originated in interspecific cross hybridization between paternal F. hepatica and maternal F. gigantica...|$|E
40|$|Determination of LDH, LDH isozymes, AlP, LAP, TAP and PAP was {{attempted}} on {{the seminal}} fluids collected from patients with sterility {{who visited the}} out-patient clinic of the Department Urology of Hiroshima University Hospital and was confirmed {{to be free from}} endocrine disorders, gonadal dysfunction and passage disturbance of seminal tract. The LDH activity was found to be low in the <b>aspermic</b> group (A-gro u p) compared to in the normospermic (N-group) or oligospermic (0 -group) groups. The percent distribution of LDH isozymes showed higher M-type in A-group than in N- and 0 -groups. The AlP activity was not definitely correlated to the number o f spermatozoa.

40|$|Stenospermy was {{identified}} in naturally occurring sugar-apple (Annona squamosa) mutants with {{great potential for}} use in genetic improvement programs. However, to date, {{there have been no}} detailed studies of the development of <b>aspermic</b> fruit in this species. The aim {{of the present study was}} to characterize the anatomy of developing fruit in the &# 8216;Brazilian Seedless&# 8217; mutant. Flower buds in pre-anthesis and developing fruits were subjected to common plant anatomy techniques. The abnormal ovules are unitegmic and orthotropic and have a long funiculus. There is evidence of fertilization, including the presence of embryos in early development and the proliferation of starch grains in the embryo sac. However, the embryos and embryo sac degenerate, although this does not affect pericarp development. Ovule abortion does not occur. The perisperm, which is formed from the peripheral layers of the nucellus, fills the cavity left by the embryo sac. The mature fruit contains numerous small sterile seeds with abundant perisperm and unlignified integument that is restricted to the micropylar region. The majority of perisperm cells are living and appear to be metabolically active in the periphery. Therefore, stenospermy leads to the formation of sterile seeds in A. squamosa, and the perisperm possibly play an important role in fruit development...|$|E
40|$|The {{activation}} {{process in}} a variety of deuterostome and protostome eggs is accompanied by cytosolic calcium transients that usually take the form of either a single or multiple propagating waves. Through the injection of aequorin (a calcium- specific luminescent reporter) and the use of a Photon Imaging Microscope (PIM), I report that the eggs of zebrafish (Danio rerio) are no exception, in that they generate a single calcium activation wave that traverses the egg at a velocity of around 9 μm/sec. There appears, however, to be no difference between the calcium-mediated activation response of eggs with regards to {{the presence or absence of}} sperm in the spawning medium. This suggests that these eggs are normally activated when they come in contact with their spawning medium, and then subsequently fertilized. The <b>aspermic</b> wave is initiated at the animal pole in the region of the micropyle, appears to propagate mainly through the yolk-free egg cortex, then terminates at the vegetal pole. As neither sperm nor external calcium are required for the initiation (or propagation) of the activation wave, this suggests that an alternative wave-trigger must be involved. In zebrafish eggs the propagating calcium wave is not followed by a wave of cortical granule exocytosis as is the case in medaka (Oryzias Zatipes) eggs. What is observed, however, is a near-synchronous exocytosis of cortical granules all over the egg surface some 30 - 60 seconds after the initiation of the calcium wave. Medaka eggs, however, contain a single layer of cortical granules located just below the plasma membrane, whereas the distribution of cortical granules in zebrafish eggs is more complex. The cortex of the animal hemisphere contains multiple layers of small cortical granules which increase in size (with an accompanying decrease in the number of layers) in an animal to vegetal pole direction. Thus, the differences in zebrafish and medaka egg morphology might account for the differences in the relationship between the calcium wave and cortical granule exocytosis during activation...|$|E
40|$|STUDY QUESTION Is male factor {{infertility}} {{associated with}} an increased risk of developing diabetes? SUMMARY ANSWER The study provides evidence that male factor infertility may predict later occurrence of diabetes mellitus with the risk being related to the severity of the underlying fertility problem. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Previous cross-sectional studies have shown an increased prevalence of comorbidities among infertile men when compared to controls. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION In this prospective cohort study, 39 516 men who had since 1994 undergone fertility treatment with their female partner were identified from the Danish national IVF register, which includes data on assumed cause of couple infertility (male/female factor, mixed and unexplained infertility) and type of fertility treatment. With a median follow-up time of 5. 6 years, each man was followed for diabetes occurrence from enrollment until 31 December 2012 using the National Diabetes Register (NDR). Men with a history of diabetes prior to their fertility diagnosis were excluded. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated by Cox proportional hazard models with age as the underlying time scale. In addition to analyzing the data for the entire IVF registration period (1994 - 2012), separate analyses were performed for men identified from the first (1994 - 2005) and second (2006 - 2012) IVF registration period owing to heterogeneity in the reporting of male factor infertility in these two time periods, because the reason for male factor infertility was not available from the first register. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Male factor infertility was identified from the variable 'yes' or 'no' from the first IVF register and through a diagnosis code (e. g. oligospermia, azoospermia) from the second IVF register. The reference group was men with male factor infertility (='no') and those with normal semen quality or sterilized men. Of the included men, 18 499 (46. 8 %) had male factor infertility and 21 017 (53. 2 %) made up the reference group. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE A total of 651 (1. 6 %) diabetes cases were identified during the follow-up period. The adjusted HR's for diabetes risk among men with male factor infertility when compared to the reference group were HR = 1. 08 (95 % CI: 0. 89, 1. 31) and HR = 1. 45 (95 % CI: 1. 06, 1. 97) for the first and second IVF registration period, respectively. When assessing the effects of individual causes of male factor infertility, the adjusted HR's for men with oligospermia, azoospermia and aspermia were HR = 1. 44 (95 % CI: 1. 01, 2. 06), HR = 2. 10 (95 % 1. 25, 3. 56) and HR = 3. 20 (95 % CI 1. 00, 10. 31), respectively. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION We found no increased risk among men identified from the first IVF register, which may be related to exposure misclassification as the reason for male factor infertility was not available from this time period. The NDR does not distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS These findings support previous studies that a man's reproductive and somatic health are closely intertwined and highlight the importance for further monitoring of these men. Further, implementation of diabetes screening may be especially relevant among <b>aspermic</b> and azoospermic men.
