25|$|The {{last two}} metrics appear {{for example in}} routing a machine that drills a given set of holes in <b>a</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>board.</b> The Manhattan metric {{corresponds}} to a machine that adjusts first one co-ordinate, and then the other, so the time {{to move to a}} new point is the sum of both movements. The maximum metric corresponds to a machine that adjusts both co-ordinates simultaneously, so the time to move to a new point is the slower of the two movements.|$|E
25|$|Heat {{dissipation}} is {{an unavoidable}} by-product of electronic devices and circuits. In general, {{the temperature of}} the device or component will depend on the thermal resistance from the component to the environment, and the heat dissipated by the component. To ensure that the component does not overheat, a thermal engineer seeks to find an efficient heat transfer path from the device to the environment. The heat transfer path may be from the component to <b>a</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> (PCB), to a heat sink, to air flow provided by a fan, but in all instances, eventually to the environment.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 {{researchers}} at Fort Monmouth grew the first synthetically produced large quartz crystals. The crystals {{were able to}} be used in the manufacture of electronic components, and made the United States largely independent of foreign imports for this critical mineral. In 1949 the first auto-assembly of printed circuits was invented. A technique for assembling electronic parts on <b>a</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>board,</b> developed by Fort Monmouth engineers, pioneered the development and fabrication of miniature circuits for both military and civilian use. Although they did not invent the transistor, Fort Monmouth scientists were among the first to recognize its importance, particularly in military applications, and did pioneer significant improvements in its composition and production.|$|E

25|$|The {{dielectric}} films, {{depending on}} the desired dielectric strength, are drawn in a special process to an extremely thin thickness, and are then provided with electrodes. The electrodes of film capacitors may be metallized aluminum or zinc applied directly {{to the surface of}} the plastic film, or a separate metallic foil. Two of these conductive layers are wound into a cylinder shaped winding, usually flattened to reduce mounting space requirements on <b>a</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>board,</b> or layered as multiple single layers stacked together, to form a capacitor body. Film capacitors, together with ceramic capacitors and electrolytic capacitors, are the most common capacitor types for use in electronic equipment, and are used in many AC and DC microelectronics and electronics circuits.|$|E
25|$|The {{address bus}} of the PowerPC 603 can {{theoretically}} access memory up to 64 MB. However, the operating system's maximum addressable memory size is 37 MB. Furthermore, {{because of the}} ASIC design of the Pippin hardware, the maximum RAM size that can be added is 32 MB. Officially, Bandai produced memory upgrade modules of 2, 4, 8 and 16 MB. The memory chips are soldered onto <b>a</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> which is placed in a plastic housing, making installation into a Pippin system simple for the end user. Japanese hackers produced an aftermarket 16 MB module, but because the module was {{much larger than the}} memory module compartment on the Pippin, installation required removing the logic board from the chassis, and then mounting the large memory module in-between the logic board and chassis.|$|E
25|$|Very small lamps {{may have}} the {{filament}} support wires extended through {{the base of the}} lamp, and can be directly soldered to <b>a</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> for connections. Some reflector-type lamps include screw terminals for connection of wires. Most lamps have metal bases that fit in a socket to support the lamp and conduct current to the filament wires. In the late 19th century, manufacturers introduced a multitude of incompatible lamp bases. General Electric introduced standard base sizes for tungsten incandescent lamps under the Mazda trademark in 1909. This standard was soon adopted across the US, and the Mazda name was used by many manufacturers under license through 1945. Today most incandescent lamps for general lighting service use an Edison screw in candelabra, intermediate, or standard or mogul sizes, or double contact bayonet base. Technical standards for lamp bases include ANSI standard C81.67 and IEC standard 60061-1 for common commercial lamp sizes, to ensure interchangeablitity between different manufacturer's products. Bayonet base lamps are frequently used in automotive lamps to resist loosening due to vibration. A bipin base is often used for halogen or reflector lamps.|$|E

2500|$|Electrochemical {{migration}} (ECM) is {{the growth}} of conductive metal filaments on or in <b>a</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> (PCB) {{under the influence of}} a DC voltage bias.

Silver also grows conducting surface paths in the presence of halide and other ions, making it a poor choice for electronics use. Tin will grow [...] "whiskers" [...] due to tension in the plated surface. Tin-Lead or solder plating also grows whiskers, only reduced by the percentage Tin replaced.

As a result, the stress point is where the two pieces join. The quality control of some manufacturers does not ensure a proper solder temperature, further weakening the stress point. Since many flash drives stick out from computers, {{they are likely to}} be bumped repeatedly and may break at the stress point. Most of the time, a break at the stress point tears the joint from the printed circuit board and results in permanent damage. However, some manufacturers produce discreet flash drives that do not stick out, and others use a solid metal uni-body that has no easily discernible stress point. [...] SD cards serve as a good alternative to USB drives since they can be inserted flush.|$|E
