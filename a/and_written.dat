40|$|This work {{concerns}} {{children with}} reading- <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> difficulties/dyslexia. My {{purpose is to}} investigate the practical experience of teachers {{as well as their}} everyday work with these children. My questions are: How do teachers work with children aged 4 - 9 who have reading- <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> difficulties/dyslexia? Which various teaching aids exist for children who have reading- <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> difficulties/dyslexia? Which subjects are affected by reading- <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> difficulties/dyslexia? To answer the above questions I have used the qualitative method. I have performed interviews and observations. Previous research has shown that reading- <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> difficulties/dyslexia is one of our most common disabilities. It is present in all classes. There is also a discussion if reading- <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> difficulties <b>and</b> dyslexia are the same thing or not. Early support is important for children with reading- <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> difficulties/dyslexia. My conclusion is that the educating system does many things to help children with reading- <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> difficulties/dyslexia by the use of supporting methods, teaching aids, special educators, attitude, motivation and cooperation with parents. Examples of teaching aids are computer software and speech synthesis. Finally I have seen that reading- <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> difficulties/dyslexia actually do affect all subjects...|$|R

40|$|Reading <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> {{teaching}} {{is very important}} for a person’s life. Reading <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> teaching begins in the first class of primary education and it is delivered by classroom teachers. Classroom teachers get prepared for teaching with the “first reading <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> teaching course” given in their undergraduate education. As the content of the course is analyzed, first reading <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> teaching has three theoretical credit hours per week. It is indicated that exercises {{should be included in the}} content of the course, however, the exercises stay in the university environment and a real reading <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> exercise cannot be realized. Based on this fact, the purpose of this study is to state that reading <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> teaching course should not be theoretical, contrarily, it should be exercises based. The study conducts an action research to achieve this purpose. Descriptive method is used in the research to establish the current status. In this research, to determine the factors which affect the success of methodology in the content of first reading <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> teaching course of classroom teaching departments, one of the qualitative research methods, a semistructured interview technique is applied. Reading <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> {{teaching is}} realized in Tokat city, central district by using voice based sentence method on 40 adults who knew neither reading nor writing. The population of the research is composed of 40 junior students of classroom teaching department who taught reading <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> to 40 adults and 30 students who were enrolled to theoretical reading <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> teaching course. Students, who participated in the first reading <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> teaching exercise, indicate that they feel more comfortable about reading <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> teaching, from now on, they know what to do, and they assert that applied reading <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> teaching is more useful. Those students who are enrolled to theoretical first reading <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> course state that they know what they are going to do, however, they do not know how to teach reading <b>and</b> <b>writing,</b> <b>and</b> they denote that this course should absolutely have an integration of theoretical and applied concepts. Based on these findings of the research, the first reading <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> teaching course of classroom teaching program should be 3 credit hours, with 1 hour theoretical, 2 hours applied content, and if required it should be 6 credit hours over 2 semesters. The course could be performed in primary school...|$|R
