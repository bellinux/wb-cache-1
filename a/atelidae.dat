50|$|The Guatemalan black howler {{belongs to}} the New World monkey family <b>Atelidae,</b> which {{contains}} howler monkeys, spider monkeys, woolly monkeys and muriquis. It {{is a member of}} the howler monkey genus Alouatta. No subspecies are recognized.|$|E
50|$|The Atelinae are a {{subfamily}} of New World monkeys in {{the family}} <b>Atelidae,</b> and includes the various spider and woolly monkeys. The primary distinguishing feature of the atelines is their long prehensile tails, which can support their entire body weight.|$|E
5000|$|New World monkeys are {{the five}} {{families}} of primates {{that are found}} in the tropical regions of Central and South America and Mexico: Callitrichidae, Cebidae, Aotidae, Pitheciidae, and <b>Atelidae.</b> The five families are ranked together as the Ceboidea, the only extant superfamily in the parvorder Platyrrhini.Platyrhini means flat-nosed, and their noses are flatter than those of other simians, with sideways-facing nostrils. Monkeys in the family <b>Atelidae,</b> such as the spider monkey, are the only primates to have prehensile tails. New World monkeys' closest relatives are the other simians, the Catarrhini ("down-nosed," [...] comprising Old World monkeys and apes). New World monkeys descend from African simians that colonized South America, a line that split off about 40 million years ago.|$|E
50|$|New World monkeys. Many New World monkeys in {{the family}} <b>Atelidae,</b> which {{includes}} howler monkeys, spider monkeys and woolly monkeys, have grasping tails often with a bare tactile pad. This is in contrast with their distant Old World monkey cousins {{who do not have}} prehensile tails.|$|E
50|$|The Pitheciidae {{are one of}} {{the five}} {{families}} of New World monkeys now recognised. Formerly, they were included in the family <b>Atelidae.</b> The family includes the titis, saki monkeys and uakaris. Most species are native to the Amazon region of Brazil, with some being found from Colombia in the north to Bolivia in the south.|$|E
50|$|Spider monkeys of {{the genus}} Ateles are New World monkeys in the {{subfamily}} Atelinae, family <b>Atelidae.</b> Like other atelines, they are found in tropical forests of Central and South America, from southern Mexico to Brazil. The genus contains seven species, {{all of which are}} under threat; the black-headed spider monkey, and brown spider monkey are critically endangered.|$|E
50|$|Previously, New World monkeys {{were divided}} between Callitrichidae and this family. For a few recent years, marmosets, {{tamarins}}, and lion tamarins were placed as a subfamily (Callitrichinae) in Cebidae, while moving other genera from Cebidae into the families Aotidae, Pitheciidae and <b>Atelidae.</b> The most recent classification of New World monkeys again splits the callitrichids off, {{leaving only the}} capuchins and squirrel monkeys in this family.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Atelidae</b> {{are one of}} {{the five}} {{families}} of New World monkeys now recognised. It was formerly included in the family Cebidae. Atelids are generally larger monkeys; the family includes the howler, spider, woolly, and woolly spider monkeys (the latter being the largest of the New World monkeys). They are found throughout the forested regions of Central and South America, from Mexico to northern Argentina.|$|E
5000|$|Geoffroy's {{spider monkey}} {{belongs to the}} New World monkey family <b>Atelidae,</b> which {{contains}} the spider monkeys, woolly monkeys, muriquis and howler monkeys. It {{is a member of}} the subfamily Atelinae, which includes the spider monkeys, woolly monkeys and muriquis, and of the genus Ateles, which contains all the spider monkeys. The genus name Ateles means [...] "imperfect", a reference to the vestigial thumb. The species name geoffroyi is in honor of French naturalist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mantled howler}} {{belongs to the}} New World monkey family <b>Atelidae,</b> the family that {{contains}} the howler monkeys, spider monkeys, woolly monkeys and muriquis. It {{is a member of}} the subfamily Alouattinae and genus Alouatta, the subfamily and genus containing all the howler monkeys. The species name is A. palliata; a pallium was a cloak or mantle worn by ancient Greeks and Romans. This refers to the long guard hairs, known as a [...] "mantle", on its sides.|$|E
50|$|Howler monkeys (genus Alouatta {{monotypic}} in subfamily Alouattinae) {{are among}} {{the largest of the}} New World monkeys and one of only a few nest-building monkeys. Fifteen species are currently recognized. Previously classified in the family Cebidae, they are now placed in the family <b>Atelidae.</b> These monkeys are native to South and Central American forests. Threats to howler monkeys include human predation, habitat destruction and being captured for pets or zoo animals. These monkeys are famous for their loud howls, which can travel three miles through dense rainforest.|$|E
50|$|The Venezuelan red howler (Alouatta seniculus) is a South American {{species of}} howler monkey, {{a type of}} New World monkey, found in the western Amazon Basin in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. The {{population}} in the Santa Cruz Department in Bolivia was split off as a separate species, the Bolivian red howler, in 1986, and more recently, splitting off the population in northeastern South America and Trinidad as the Guyanan red howler has occurred. All howler monkeys belong to the family <b>Atelidae</b> and the infraorder Platyrrhini (New World monkeys).|$|E
50|$|The Bolivian red howler {{is a part}} of the Atelidae; <b>Atelidae</b> are a {{subfamily}} of New World monkey, {{which includes}} the various spider and woolly monkeys. They are covered in reddish orange hair. The red howler are found only in neotropical South America in places like Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Perú, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela. They extend from northwest Colombia east and south to the Amazon River in eastern Brazil. They can be largely found in tropical forests, as well as in riverine and seasonally swamped woodlands and in forests above 1000 meters (3280 feet) above sea level, humid and dry forest high terra firma. They stay in the high altitudes.|$|E
50|$|Lagothrix cana or {{the gray}} woolly monkey {{predominantly}} lives in cloud forest, {{a type of}} forest under cloud cover {{for most of the}} year. They can be found anywhere from 1,000 to 2,500 metres above sea level. The population of gray woolly monkeys in Bolivia have been reported to be found as low as 700 metres above sea level. They spend the majority of their time high in the tree tops in search of food. They move through the trees using their large prehensile tails, which is a common trait seen in the family <b>Atelidae.</b> They are capable of hanging from their tails and often use them to bridge gaps between trees when travelling in them.|$|E
40|$|Orthologous {{sequences}} of six nuclear genes {{were obtained for}} all recognized genera of New World monkeys (Primates: Platyrrhini) and outgroups to evaluate the phylogenetic relationships and to estimate divergence times. Phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed by maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian approaches. All methods resolved with 100 % branch support genus-level relationships, except for the grouping of Aotus as a sister taxa of Cebus and Saimiri, which was supported by low bootstrap percentages and posterior probability. All approaches depict three monophyletic New World monkey families: <b>Atelidae,</b> Cebidae, and Pitheciidae; also within each family, all approaches depict the same branching topology. However, the approaches diVer in depicting the relationships of the three families to one another. Maximum parsimony depicts the <b>Atelidae</b> and Cebidae as sister families next joined by the Pithecii-dae. Conversely, likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic trees group families <b>Atelidae</b> and Pitheciidae together {{to the exclusion of}} Cebidae. Divergence time estimations using both local molecular clock and Bayesian approaches suggest the families diverged from one another over a short period of geological time in the late Oligocene–early Miocene...|$|E
40|$|New World monkeys (NWM) {{represent}} a monophy-letic group of higher primates (infraorder Platyrrhini). The currently over 120 recognized species {{are assigned to}} at least 16 genera. Today these species are commonly clas-sified in 3 families, the Cebidae, <b>Atelidae</b> and Pitheciidae [Opazo et al., 2006; Wildman et al., 2009; Perelman et al., 2011; Matsui and Hasegawa, 2012 for recent review]. Owl monkeys (genus Aotus) are usually included in the fam-ily Cebidae, while Groves [2001] classified Aotus as a fourth family. The Cebidae comprise the capuchins, squirrel monkeys, marmosets, and tamarins (and owl monkeys); the <b>Atelidae</b> include spider monkeys, woolly monkeys, howlers, and muriquis; and the Pitheciidae comprise sakis, uakaris and titis. The majority of studies agreed on the classification of 11 genera in 3 monophyletic clades: (1) the large monkeys with prehensile tails from the family <b>Atelidae</b> with genera Alouatta, Ateles, Lagothrix, and Brachyteles; (2) the seed predator monkeys from the family Pitheciidae, with gen-era Pithecia, Chiropotes and Cacajao), and (3) the small clawed monkeys from the subfamily Callithrichina...|$|E
40|$|Conclusive {{evidence}} was provided that gamma 1, the upstream {{of the two}} linked simian gamma-globin loci (5 '-gamma 1 -gamma 2 - 3 '), is a pseudogene in a major group of New World monkeys. Sequence analysis of PCR-amplified genomic fragments of predicted sizes revealed that all extant genera of the platyrrhine family <b>Atelidae</b> [Lagothrix (woolly monkeys), Brachyteles (woolly spider monkeys), Ateles (spider monkeys), and Alouatta (howler monkeys) ] share a large deletion that removed most of exon 2, all of intron 2 and exon 3, {{and much of the}} 3 ' flanking sequence of gamma 1. The fact that two functional gamma-globin genes were not present in early ancestors of the <b>Atelidae</b> (and that gamma 1 was the dispensible gene) suggests that for much or even all of their evolution, platyrrhines have had gamma 2 as the primary fetally expressed gamma-globin gene, in contrast to catarrhines (e. g., humans and chimpanzees) that have gamma 1 as the primary fetally expressed gamma-globin gene. Results from promoter sequences further suggest that all three platyrrhine families (<b>Atelidae,</b> Cebidae, and Pitheciidae) have gamma 2 rather than gamma 1 as their primary fetally expressed gamma-globin gene. The implications of this suggestion were explored in terms of how gene redundancy, regulatory mutations, and distance of each gamma-globin gene from the locus control region were possibly involved in the acquisition and maintenance of fetal, rather than embryonic, expression...|$|E

40|$|AbstractHere we applied phylogenetically based {{conservation}} analyses using a novel multivariate {{approach to}} better evaluate {{the effects of}} human land use on different primate lineages worldwide. Using a 1 °× 1 ° grid, we obtained information on primate species distribution and the cover of six land use categories (Urban, Village, Cropland, Rangeland, Seminatural and Wild). We synthesized the phylogenetic composition into principal coordinates of phylogenetic structure. We correlated phylogenetic composition and land use in each region, and assessed statistical significance via null model. In America, the <b>Atelidae</b> clade was associated to areas with larger coverage of villages whereas Pitheciidae was found on areas with higher cover of wildlands. Moreover, we found some <b>Atelidae,</b> Callitrichidae and Pitheciidae species {{to be associated with}} seminatural areas, while other Alouatta and Callicebus species were more related with higher coverage of rangelands. In Madagascar, Lemuridae was negatively associated with wild areas. Africa did not show any statistically significant association between clades and land use. Asia had an intense association of some Cercopithecidae species with high coverage of villages. Primate lineages are currently facing different land use pressures, which would imply in the need of clade-specific conservation planning...|$|E

40|$|To {{localize}} interstitial telomeric sequences (ITSs) and to {{test whether}} their pattern of distribution could be linked to chromosomal evolution, we hybridized telomeric sequence probes (peptide nucleic acid, PNA) on metaphases of New World monkeys: Callithrix argentata, Callithrix jacchus, Cebuella pygmaea, Saguinus oedipus, Saimiri sciureus, Aotus lemurinus griseimembra, Aotus nancymaae (Cebidae), Lagothrix lagotricha (<b>Atelidae)</b> and Callicebus moloch (Pithecidae), characterized by a rapid radiation and {{a high rate of}} chromosomal rearrangements. Our analysis of the probe signal localization allowed us to show in all the species analysed, as normally, the telomeric location at the terminal ends of chromosomes and unexpected signal distributions in some species. Indeed, in three species among the nine studied, Aotus lemurinus griseimembra, Aotus nancymaae (Cebidae) and Lagothrix lagotricha (<b>Atelidae),</b> we showed a high variability in terms of localization and degree of amplification of interstitial telomeric sequences, especially for the ones found at centromeric or pericentromeric positions (het-ITS). A comparative analysis, between species, of homologous chromosomes to human syntenies, on which we have found positive interspersed PNA signals, allowed us to explain the observed pattern of ITS distribution as results of chromosomal rearrangements in the neotropical primates analysed. This evidence permitted us to discuss the possible implication of ITSs as phylogenetic markers for closely related species. Moreover, reviewing previous literature data of ITSs distribution in Primates and in the light of our results, we suggest an underestimation of ITSs and highlight the importance of the molecular cytogenetics approach in characterizing ITSs, which role is still not clarified...|$|E
40|$|The woolly-monkey (Lagothrix lagothricha) is an antropoid {{belonging}} to the <b>Atelidae</b> Family which includes the largest neotropical primates. A female cadaver woolly-monkey was fixed in a 10 % formaldehyde solution and dissected using a stereoscopic magnifying glass and photodocumented. The brachial plexus originated from the spinal nerves C 5 to C 8 and T 1, forming the cranial, medium, and caudal stems, from which derived the peripheral nerves; those nerves had similar origin and innervation area when compared to plexuses from other primates, {{with the exception of}} the musculocutaneous nerve that crossed the coracobraquial muscle.

40|$|Most New World monkeys have an X-chromosome opsin gene {{polymorphism}} {{that produces a}} variety of different colour vision phenotypes. Howler monkeys (Alouatta), one of the four genera in the family <b>Atelidae</b> lack this polymorphism. Instead, they have acquired uniform trichromatic colour vision similar to that of Old World monkeys, apes and people through opsin gene duplication. In order to determine whether closely related monkeys share this arrangement, spectral sensitivity functions that allow inferences about cone pigments were measured for 56 monkeys from two other Atelid genera, spider monkeys (Ateles) and woolly monkeys (Lagothrix). Unlike howler monkeys, both spider and woolly monkeys are polymorphic for their middle- and long-wavelength cone photopigments. However, they also differ from other polymorphic New World monkeys in having two rather than three possible types of middle- and long-wavelength cone pigments. This feature directly influences the relative numbers of dichromatic and trichromatic monkeys...|$|E
40|$|Four DNA {{datasets}} {{were combined}} in tandem (6700 bp) and Maximum parsimony and Neighbor-Joining analyses were performed. The results suggest three groups emerging {{almost at the}} same time: <b>Atelidae,</b> Pitheciidae and Cebidae. The total analysis strongly supports the monophyly of the Cebidae family, grouping Aotus, Cebus and Saimiri with the small callitrichines. In the callitrichines, the data link Cebuela to Callithrix, place Callimico as a sister group of Callithrix/Cebuella, and show Saguinus to be the earliest offshoot of the callitrichines. In the family Pithecidae, Callicebus is the basal genus. Finally, combined molecular data showed congruent branching in the atelid clade, setting up Alouatta as the basal lineage and Brachyteles-Lagothrix as a sister group and the most derived branch. Two major points remain to be clarified in the platyrrhine phylogeny: (i) what is the exact branching pattern of Aotus, Cebus, Saimiri and the small callitrichines, and (ii), which two of these three lineages, pitheciines, atelines or cebids, are more closely related...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{intergeneric}} variability of the Y chromosome, we describe the hybridization of the Y chromosome of Brachyteles arachnoides, obtained by microdissection, to metaphases of Ateles belzebuth marginatus, Lagothrix lagothricha, and Alouatta male specimens. Brachyteles arachnoides (Atelinae) has 62 chromosomes and a very small Y chromosome. Our {{results showed that the}} Brachyteles arachnoides Y chromosome probe hybridized to Lagothrix lagothricha metaphases yielding one hybridization signal on only the tiny Y chromosome, and when hybridized with Ateles belzebuth marginatus metaphases it yielded one hybridization signal on two thirds of the small acrocentric Y chromosome. However, no hybridization signal was observed in Alouatta metaphases (subfamily Alouattinae), a closely related genus in the <b>Atelidae</b> family. Furthermore, our data support a close phylogenetic relationship among Brachyteles, Ateles, and Lagothrix and their placement in the Atelinae subfamily, but exclude Alouatta from this group indicating its placement as basal to this group.

Using a combination wet-bench and computational approach we recovered 190 Alu insertions, 183 of which are speciWc to the genomes of nine New World primates. We used these loci to investigate branching order and have produced a cladogram that supports a sister relationship between <b>Atelidae</b> (spider, woolly, and howler monkeys) and Cebidae (marmosets, tamarins, and owl monkeys) and then the joining of this two family clade to Pitheciidae (titi and saki monkeys).

40|$|ABO locus {{presents}} {{three main}} alleles: A, B and O. A and B encode glycosyltransferases that catalyze the addiction of an N-GalNac and D-galactose to a precursor substance (H substance), producing A and B antigens, while the O allele {{does not produce}} a functional protein. The presence of A and B antigens have been associated to resistance against infectious agents which could use them as attachment factors increasing the virulence of some parasitic agents. As these antigens are not restrict to humans, analyses them in others species, for instance non-human primates, may be crucial to {{understand the relationship between}} pathogens and ABO phenotypes. Despite of the relevance of this issue, in the last decade few studies have addressed, mainly in New World Monkeys (NWM), natural reservoir of tropical diseases in Amazon Region. In order to understand the evolution of the ABO system in the primates, it has been obtained the partial sequence of the most important exon of ABO gene (exon 7), in platyrrhini families: <b>Atelidae,</b> Pithecidae and Cebidae. Then, it has been compared the sequences obtained those present in the literature, and measured the selective pressure. The present results shown that residues 266 and 268 are also crucial to distinguish A and B phenotypes in the platyrrhines, such as in catarrhines, and the 266 codon is under positive selection, although the most site codons are under action of purifying selection...|$|E
