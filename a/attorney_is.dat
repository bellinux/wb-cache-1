25|$|Lenders {{argue that}} the real estate attorney's fee, for example, is a {{pass-through}} cost, not a cost of the lending. In effect, they are arguing that the attorney's fee is a separate transaction and {{not a part of}} the loan. Consumer advocates argue that this would be true if the customer is free to select which <b>attorney</b> <b>is</b> used. If the lender insists, however, on using a specific attorney, the cost should be looked at as a component of the total cost of doing business with that lender. This area is made more complicated by the practice of contingency fees – for example, when the lender receives money from the attorney and other agents to be the one used by the lender. Because of this, U.S. regulators require all lenders to produce an affiliated business disclosure form which shows the amounts paid between the lender and the appraisal firms, attorneys, etc.|$|E

500|$|An {{article in}} the North Carolina Law Review argued that Kennedy's {{majority}} opinion wrongly set forth {{the understanding of the}} role of an attorney. The author, Jessica Sharpe, criticized the Court's thesis that the role of the <b>attorney</b> <b>is</b> that of an advocate such that a restriction on the attorney served as a direct restriction of advocacy. This rationale, Sharpe argued, could undermine the balance of abortion restrictions because state regulations on abortion access also could be seen as an intrusion into doctor–patient speech. Because Velazquez [...] "blurred" [...] this distinction, the privileged nature of doctor–patient conversations could be subjected to future regulations and limitations.|$|E

Lee, whose novel {{had a profound effect}} on civil rights, never commented on why she wrote about Robinson. Literature professor Patrick Chura noted several similarities between Till's case and that of Robinson. Writer James Baldwin loosely based his 1964 drama Blues for Mister Charlie on the Till case. He later divulged that Till's murder had been bothering him for several years.|$|E
