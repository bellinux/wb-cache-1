5|$|There {{are also}} {{a number of small}} items of {{uncertain}} function, described as toiletry pieces. Some are picks, others perhaps scrapers, and three have empty sockets at one end, which probably contained organic material such as bristle, to make <b>a</b> <b>brush.</b> The size of these would be appropriate for cleaning the teeth or applying cosmetics, among other possibilities.|$|E
5|$|A {{wildfire}} or {{wildland fire}} is {{a fire in}} an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural area. Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as <b>a</b> <b>brush</b> fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire. Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago. Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the archaeological}} record does not provide {{examples}} of brushes or pens, analysis of ink strokes on the Postclassic codices suggests that it was applied with <b>a</b> <b>brush</b> with a tip fashioned from pliable hair. A Classic period sculpture from Copán, Honduras, depicts a scribe with an inkpot fashioned from a conch shell. Excavations at Aguateca uncovered a number of scribal artefacts from the residences of elite status scribes, including palettes and mortars and pestles.|$|E

5|$|In the aye-aye, the sublingua is not {{shaped like}} <b>a</b> <b>brush</b> {{like it is}} in most lemurs. Instead, there is a {{thickened}} area along the plica mediana or lytta which has a hook-shaped structure on the end. Within cheirogaleids, the sublingua lacks cartilage, and the sublingua of the gray mouse lemur has a distinct plica mediana and ends in two lobe-like projections that lack keratinized serrations, but have three keratinized ridges which make the sublingua rigid.|$|E
5|$|Kulintang gongs {{are made}} using the cire perdue method, a lost-wax process used for casting the {{individual}} gongs. The first phase {{is the creation}} of wax molds of the gongs. In the past, before the availability of standardized wax sheets made specifically for foundry use, the molds were made out of either beeswax (talo) or candle wax (kandilà). The wax mold is covered with a special mixture of finely powdered coal/mud, which is applied on the wax surface using <b>a</b> <b>brush.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Phoenix Zoo {{garnered}} worldwide {{attention for}} one of its animals, an Asian elephant named Ruby. Ruby came to the zoo in 1973, just months after being born in Thailand. After noticing Ruby doodling in the sand with sticks, her keeper decided to give her <b>a</b> <b>brush</b> and paint. Ruby quickly became known for her paintings, whose sales raised over US$200,000 for the zoo. Art collectors {{all over the world}} joined 18-month waiting lists and paid hundreds of dollars for original prints.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> pastry <b>brush,</b> {{also known}} as <b>a</b> basting <b>brush,</b> is <b>a</b> cooking utensil used to spread butter, oil or glaze on food. Traditional pastry brushes are made with natural {{bristles}} or a plastic or nylon fiber similar to <b>a</b> paint <b>brush,</b> while modern kitchen brushes may have silicone bristles. In baking breads and pastries, <b>a</b> pastry <b>brush</b> is used to spread a glaze or egg wash on the crust or surface of the food.In roasting meats, <b>a</b> pastry <b>brush</b> {{may be used to}} sop up juices or drippings from under pan and spread them {{on the surface of the}} meat to crisp the skin.|$|R

5|$|In 1870 republican {{sentiment}} in Britain {{was given a}} boost when the French Emperor, Napoleon III, was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War and the French Third Republic was declared. However, {{in the winter of}} 1871, <b>a</b> <b>brush</b> with death led to an improvement in both Edward's popularity with the public and his relationship with his mother. While staying at Londesborough Lodge, near Scarborough, North Yorkshire, Edward contracted typhoid, the disease that was believed to have killed his father. There was great national concern, and one of his fellow guests (Lord Chesterfield) died. Edward's recovery was greeted with almost universal relief. Public celebrations included the composition of Arthur Sullivan's Festival Te Deum. Edward cultivated politicians from all parties, including republicans, as his friends, and thereby largely dissipated any residual feelings against him.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United Football Club is an English {{professional}} football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester. The club was founded as Newton Heath LYR F.C. in 1878 and turned professional in 1885, {{before joining the}} Football League in 1892. After <b>a</b> <b>brush</b> with bankruptcy in 1901, the club reformed as Manchester United in 1902. Manchester United currently play in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. They have not {{been out of the}} top tier since 1975, and they have never been lower than the second tier. They have also been involved in European football ever since they became the first English club to enter the European Cup in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Pfaster, who {{was behind}} the exhumations, proves Mulder's {{prediction}} correct when he brings a prostitute to his apartment. When the prostitute discovers a collection of funerary wreaths in Pfaster's bedroom, he kills her and removes her fingers. Later, Pfaster—having been hired as a frozen food delivery man through charming the female interviewer—delivers to a low-security house {{of a woman with}} teenage daughters. He requests the bathroom to wash his hands, and whilst there steals some discarded hair from <b>a</b> <b>brush</b> he found in the trashcan. Pfaster attends a night class at a community college, where a female classmate defends herself after he makes threatening advances. He is arrested and is placed in a jail cell across from a suspect being interrogated for Pfaster's crimes by Mulder, Scully, and Bocks. Pfaster shows interest in Scully, and learns her name from the interrogated suspect. Pfaster is later released as his charges were dropped.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> camel-hair <b>brush</b> is <b>a</b> type of {{paintbrush}} {{with soft}} bristles made from natural hairs, usually squirrel. Camel hair {{is not a}} suitable material, although historically camel was used for ancient Chinese ink brushes (and for camel hair cloth). It is <b>a</b> widely used <b>brush</b> in art, but is considered inferior to the more expensive sable and ox-hair brushes. In some niche applications, such as pinstriping, camel hair is <b>an</b> ideal <b>brush.</b> Camel-hair brushes have numerous uses outside of art, particularly dusting where <b>a</b> soft <b>brush</b> is needed for delicate objects or skin.|$|R

5|$|Teapot: The teapot {{was invented}} during the Yuan Dynasty, tea {{preparation}} in previous dynasties did not utilize a teapot. In the Tang Dynasty, a cauldron {{was used to}} boil grounded tea, which was served in bowls. Song Dynasty tea was made by pouring water boiled using a kettle into a bowl with finely ground tea leaves. <b>A</b> <b>brush</b> was then used to stir the tea. The innovation of the teapot, a vessel that steeps tea leaves in boiling water, occurs during the late Yuan dynasty. Written evidence of a teapot appears in the Yuan Dynasty text, Jiyuan Conghua, which describes a teapot that the author, Cai Shizhan, bought from the scholar Sun Daoming. By the Ming Dynasty, teapots were widespread in China.|$|E
5|$|When collected, {{the skin}} of the cap is left intact, and dirt is brushed off the surface. Pores are left unless old and soft. Boletus aereus is {{especially}} suited for drying, a process which enhances its flavour and aroma. Like other boletes, the mushrooms can be dried by being sliced and strung separately on twine, then hung close to the ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with <b>a</b> <b>brush</b> (washing is not recommended), and then placed in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer on top of a boiler or hot water tank. Once dry, they are kept in an airtight jar. They are easily reconstituted by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water is infused with the mushroom aroma and can be used as stock in subsequent cooking. When dried, a small amount of the mushroom can improve the taste of less flavoursome fungi-based dishes.|$|E
5|$|Command of the Amazon {{then passed}} to Captain Samuel Sutton, who was succeeded the {{following}} year by Captain William Parker. Under Parker, Amazon captured the 16-gun privateer Felix on 26 July 1803, and survived <b>a</b> <b>brush</b> with a French fleet off Cape Capet on 2 May 1804. Amazon {{was one of the}} ships {{to take part in the}} Trafalgar Campaign {{the following year}}, serving with Nelson in the Mediterranean. On one occasion in December 1804 Nelson ordered Parker to bring a consignment of live bullocks to supply the fleet off Toulon. The Amazon was a notably smart ship, and had just been repainted, so presumably the instruction to convert his ship into a floating farmyard was not received with much enthusiasm. Parker duly returned with a shipment, prompting Nelson to enquire with gentle humour 'Well, Parker, of course you would not dirty the Amazon for much for anything; have you brought a dozen and a half, or a dozen?' Parker had in fact brought sixty bullocks and thirty sheep, prompting Nelson to promise a reward for his good service.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by Robert Raikes, Trimmer {{also became}} {{active in the}} Sunday school movement, {{founding}} the first Sunday school for poor children in Old Brentford in 1786. She {{and two of the}} ministers in her parish, Charles Sturgess and Charles Coates, organized a fund drive and established several schools for the poor children of the neighborhood. Initially, five hundred boys and girls wanted to attend Trimmer's Sunday school; unable to accommodate such numbers, she decided to exclude those under five years of age and restricted each family to one pupil. The parish set up three schools, each with about thirty students—one for older boys, one for younger boys and one for girls. While some other educational reformers of the period such as Mary Wollstonecraft argued for co-educational instruction, Trimmer was opposed to such pedagogical changes; she believed in educating the sexes separately. The students were taught to read, with the aim of teaching them to read the Bible. The students were also encouraged to keep clean—"a present of <b>a</b> <b>brush</b> and comb was given to all who desired them". Trimmer's schools became so well known and admired that Raikes, Trimmer's initial inspiration, recommended those who needed assistance organizing a Sunday school to turn to Trimmer; even Queen Charlotte asked Trimmer's advice on founding a Sunday school at Windsor.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>brush</b> is the {{traditional}} writing instrument for Chinese calligraphy. The body of the brush is commonly made from bamboo or other materials such as wood, porcelain, or horn. The head of the brush is typically made from animal hair, such as weasel, rabbit, deer, goat, pig, tiger, wolf, etc. There is also a tradition in both China and Japan of making <b>a</b> <b>brush</b> using the hair of a newborn child, as a once-in-a-lifetime souvenir. This practice {{is associated with the}} legend of an ancient Chinese scholar who scored first in the imperial examinations by using such a personalized brush. Calligraphy brushes are widely considered an extension of the calligrapher's arm.|$|E
