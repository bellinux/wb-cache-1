5|$|Hergé's {{supporting}} {{characters have}} been cited as far more developed than the central character, each imbued with strength of character and depth of personality, which has been {{compared with that of}} the characters of Charles Dickens. Hergé used the supporting characters to create a realistic world in which to set his protagonists' adventures. To further the realism <b>and</b> <b>continuity,</b> characters would recur throughout the series. The occupation of Belgium and the restrictions imposed upon Hergé forced him to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting troublesome political situations. As a result, the colourful supporting cast was developed during this period.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{selling point}} of Front Mission was its {{storytelling}} approach.

Although the Front Mission video games use self-contained, standalone stories, these tie into a greater overarching storyline that encompasses the entire series. In combination with the stories from its other media, the series possesses a level of storytelling depth <b>and</b> <b>continuity</b> comparable to a serial drama.|$|E

5|$|Vector {{spaces are}} the subject of linear algebra and are well {{characterized}} by their dimension, which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces arise naturally in mathematical analysis, as function spaces, whose vectors are functions. These vector spaces are generally endowed with additional structure, which may be a topology, allowing the consideration of issues of proximity <b>and</b> <b>continuity.</b> Among these topologies, those that are defined by a norm or inner product are more commonly used, as having a notion of distance between two vectors. This is particularly the case of Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces, which are fundamental in mathematical analysis.|$|E
5|$|As early Homo sapiens {{began to}} diversify the {{ecological}} zones that they inhabited during the MSA, {{the archaeological record}} associated with these zones begins to show evidence for regional continuities. These continuities are significant {{for a number of}} reasons. The expansion of Homo sapiens into various ecological zones demonstrates an ability to adapt to a variety of environmental contexts including marine environments, savanna grasslands, relatively arid deserts, and forests. This adaptability is reflected in MSA artifacts found in these zones. These artifacts display stylistic variability depending on zone. During the Acheulian, which spanned from 1.5 million years ago to 300 thousand years ago, lithic technology displayed incredible homogeneity throughout all ecological niches. MSA technologies, with their evidence for regional variability <b>and</b> <b>continuity,</b> represent a remarkable advance. These data have been used to support theories of social and stylistic development throughout the MSA.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{theory has}} {{implications}} in residence and contact disputes, and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus {{focusing on the}} quality <b>and</b> <b>continuity</b> of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. Rutter noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships. Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along {{with the impact of}} step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.|$|E
40|$|Two {{relationships}} {{considered by}} Weston [1] {{for a pair}} of topologies on a set X are translated to a function setting. An attempt to characterize the two resulting types of functions leads to new characterizations of weak <b>continuity</b> <b>and</b> almost <b>continuity.</b> After showing that weak <b>continuity</b> <b>and</b> almost <b>continuity</b> are independent, interrelationships are sought. This leads to the definition of subweak <b>continuity</b> <b>and</b> a new characterization for almost openness. Finally, several published results are strengthened or slightly extended...|$|R

5|$|Eliot {{started writing}} East Coker in 1939, and {{modelled}} the poem after Burnt Norton {{as a way}} to focus his thoughts. The poem served as a sort of opposite to the popular idea that The Waste Land served as an expression of disillusionment after World War I, though Eliot never accepted this interpretation. The poem focuses on life, death, <b>and</b> <b>continuity</b> between the two. Humans are seen as disorderly and science is viewed as unable to save mankind from its flaws. Instead, science and reason lead mankind to warfare, and humanity needs to become humble in order to escape the cycle of destruction. To be saved, people must recognize Christ as their savior as well as their need for redemption.|$|E
5|$|Groups {{are also}} applied {{in many other}} {{mathematical}} areas. Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying {{the properties of the}} corresponding groups. For example, Henri Poincaré founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the fundamental group. By means of this connection, topological properties such as proximity <b>and</b> <b>continuity</b> translate into properties of groups. For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered null-homotopic (and thus irrelevant), because it can be continuously shrunk to a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around the hole). This way, the fundamental group detects the hole.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} ordered in 2012, after Joss Whedon wrote and {{directed}} Marvel's The Avengers, and was filmed in early 2013 in Los Angeles, California, with some additional filming in Paris, France. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by principal cast members Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge. Cobie Smulders guest stars, reprising her role of Maria Hill from The Avengers, with previous Whedon collaborators J. August Richards and Ron Glass also guest starring. Emphasis was put on consistency <b>and</b> <b>continuity</b> with the MCU films, and some elements are reused from the films throughout the episode, most notably Extremis. The visual effects for the episode were nominated at the Visual Effects Society Awards.|$|E

5|$|From 1870 to 1880 {{it became}} clear that cell nuclei are never formed anew but always derived from the {{substance}} of another nucleus. In 1882 Flemming observed the longitudinal splitting of chromosomes in the dividing nucleus and concluded that each daughter nucleus received half of each of the chromosomes of the mother nucleus: then by the early 20th century {{it was found that the}} number of chromosomes in a given species is constant. With genetic continuity confirmed and the finding by Eduard Strasburger that the nuclei of reproductive cells (in pollen and embryo) have a reducing division (halving of chromosomes, now known as meiosis) the field of heredity was opened up. By 1926 Thomas Morgan was able to outline a theory of the gene and its structure and function. The form and function of plastids received similar attention, the association with starch being noted at an early date. With observation of the cellular structure of all organisms and the process of cell division <b>and</b> <b>continuity</b> of genetic material, the analysis of the structure of protoplasm and the cell wall as well as that of plastids and vacuoles – what is now known as cytology, or cell theory became firmly established.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, {{commodity}} prices for copper and nickel, which make up the five-cent coin, rose dramatically, pushing the cost of manufacturing a nickel from 3.46 cents in fiscal year 2003 to 10.09 cents in fiscal year 2012. By comparison, a Canadian nickel (which is primarily made of steel) still costs less than its face value to produce as of 2013. In response, Mint Director Henrietta Fore in 2004 asked Congress to fund research into lower-cost alternatives to present coinage metals. Although the initiative lapsed when she left office in 2005, in 2010, Congress passed the Coin Modernization, Oversight, <b>and</b> <b>Continuity</b> Act (CMOCA), directing the Mint to explore alternatives to the present compositions of the six denominations, from cent to dollar. In 2011, the Mint awarded a contract to study the issue to Concurrent Technologies Corporation of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The report in response to the legislation declared that there is no material that would reduce the one-cent coin's manufacturing cost to below one cent, so it was removed from consideration. The report requested additional time to study the issue, ensuring the continuation, for the present, of the existing coinage metals. The Mint expected demand for nickels in commerce to increase from 840 million needed in Fiscal Year 2011 to 1.08 billion in 2015.|$|E
