"These ladies," [...] {{said the}} gentleman, [...] "are not {{accustomed}} to the cold atmosphere of this region, and I have therefore forbidden them to talk, hoping thus to prevent injury from the inhalation of frosty air. So far we have not suffered, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> some food left. About noon I noticed smoke floating over this shed, and I forced {{open the door and}} made my way for some little distance outside, hoping to discover whence it came. I then heard voices {{on the other side of}} the enormous snow-drift behind us; but I could see no possible way of getting over the drift. Feeling that I must, without fail, open communication with any human beings who might be near us, I attempted to shout; but the cold had so affected my voice that I could not do so. I thereupon set my wits to work. At the back of this shed is a small window closed by a wooden shutter. I opened this shutter, and found outside a wall of snow packed closely against it. The snow was not very hard, and I believed that it would not be difficult to tunnel a way through it to the place where the voices seemed to be. I immediately set to work, for I feared that if we were obliged to remain here another night without assistance we should be compelled to-morrow morning to eat those four hard-boiled eggs which the ladies are holding, and which, very shortly, I must boil again." ...|$|E
