5|$|Measurements of {{the motion}} of intracluster {{planetary}} nebulae between M87 and M86 suggest that these two galaxies <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> each other {{and this may be}} their first encounter. M87 may have encountered M84 in the past, as evidenced by the truncation of the outer halo of the former from tidal effects. However, another possible cause of this truncation is a contraction due to an unseen mass falling into M87 {{from the rest of the}} cluster, which, in particular, may be the hypothesized dark matter. A third possibility is that the halo formation was truncated as a result of early feedback from the active galactic nucleus at the core of M87.|$|E

2500|$|On July 2, 2013, the Obama Administration {{announced}} that it would be delaying one of the key requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly known as [...] "Obamacare"). [...] The requirement that all companies which employed more than 50 workers must offer an employee health insurance plan or pay a fine would now be delayed until 2015, according to the Administration. The announcement was made on the United States Department of the Treasury's website. [...] In that statement, the Administration {{announced that}} they would be delaying implementation for a year in order to meet two goals: [...] "First, it will allow us to consider ways to simplify the new reporting requirements consistent with the law. [...] Second, it will provide time to adapt health coverage and reporting systems while employers <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> making health coverage affordable and accessible for their employees." [...] Critics sarcastically noted that [...] "despite nearly four years of lead time, (the Obama Administration) still won’t have the capacity to collect from employers the information required to determine which employers will be subject to penalties in 2014." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ford Motor Company {{was one of}} {{the first}} American {{corporations}} to seek help from Deming. In 1981, Ford's sales were falling. Between 1979 and 1982, Ford had incurred $3 billion in losses. Ford's newly appointed Corporate Quality Director, Larry Moore, was charged with recruiting Deming to help jump-start a quality movement at Ford. Deming questioned the company's culture and the way its managers operated. To Ford's surprise, Deming talked not about quality, but about management. He told Ford that management actions were responsible for 85 percent of all problems in developing better cars. In 1986, Ford came out with a profitable line of cars, the Taurus-Sable line. In a letter to Autoweek Magazine, Donald Petersen, then Ford chairman, said, [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> building a quality culture at Ford and the many changes that have been taking place here have their roots directly in Deming's teachings." [...] By 1986, Ford had become the most profitable American auto company. For the first time since the 1920s, its earnings had exceeded those of archrival General Motors (GM). Ford had come to lead the American automobile industry in improvements. Ford's following years' earnings confirmed that its success was not a fluke, for its earnings continued to exceed GM and Chrysler's.|$|E
