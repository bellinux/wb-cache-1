5|$|An {{unexpected}} {{bonus of}} the Bruneval raid was the Germans' {{efforts to improve}} defences at Würzburg stations <b>and</b> <b>prevent</b> similar attacks.

5|$|Even after {{complete}} remission is achieved, leukemic cells likely remain in numbers {{too small to}} be detected with current diagnostic techniques. If no further postremission or consolidation therapy is given, almost all people with AML will eventually relapse.
