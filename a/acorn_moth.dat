50|$|Cydia splendana, the {{chestnut}} tortrix, is a moth of the Tortricidae family. It {{is found}} in Europe. It {{is also known as}} the <b>acorn</b> <b>moth,</b> but this can also refer to Blastobasis glandulella from North America, which belongs to the more primitive family Blastobasidae.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lighting}} of ground fires killed the larvae of <b>acorn</b> <b>moths</b> and <b>acorn</b> weevils by burning them during their dormancy {{period in the}} soil. The pests can infest and consume more than 95% of an oak's acorns.|$|R
5000|$|In Hungary, {{the most}} common moth {{threatening}} chestnut trees is the <b>acorn</b> <b>moth</b> (Laspeyreisa splendana) and its subspecies. Its grayish-yellow larvae cause similar damage {{to that of the}} chestnut weevil, but they spin characteristic webs among the nutchips and larval excrement. This moth causes about 5-41% of the damage that occurs in western Hungary's plantations. Plantations need regular protection against these moths, the occurrence of which does not decrease.|$|E
40|$|Identification {{of the sex}} {{pheromone}} of Cydia splendana (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae) by pheromone gland analysis {{followed by}} field trapping with synthetic compounds shows the occurrence of two pheromone races. <b>Acorn</b> <b>moth</b> females from Sweden, where oak Quercus robur is the only host plant, use a blend of the E,Z and E,E isomers of 8, 10 -dodecadien- 1 -yl acetate. In Central and Southern Europe, where C. splendana feeds on chestnut Castanea sativa and several species of oak, males respond to another isomer blend, E,E and Z,E. The distribution of the two pheromone races of C. splendana overlaps in Northern France, where they share oak as plant host. Differences in sex communication signals between these populations of C. splendana corroborate the role of specific mate recognition in speciation events...|$|E
