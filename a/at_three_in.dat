5|$|Other {{than its}} use in the kulintang ensemble, the agung also had other non-ensemble uses among the Maguindanao and Maranao. The agung {{has been used to}} warn others of {{impending}} danger, announcing the time of day and other important occasions. For instance, long ago the sultan would beat the agung repeatedly to announce the onset of a meeting or during the fasting month of Ramadhan, the agung would ring either <b>at</b> <b>three</b> <b>in</b> the morning to indicate the signal to eat (sawl) or at sunset, to mark the end for fasting that day. And supposedly due to the deep, loud sound the agung produces, people believed that it possessed supernatural powers. For instance, during an earthquake, the locals of Maguindanao would strike the agung in a fast, loud rhythm called baru-baru, believing its vibrations would either lessen or even halt the jolt of an earthquake.|$|E

25|$|On 10 November, Apollo chased a xebec and then, {{coming up}} on a brig, chased and {{captured}} her. The brig was Resolution, a sloop of war, of 18 guns and 149 men, {{under the command of}} Don Francisco Darrichena. She was the former British navy cutter Resolution and had sailed from Vera Cruz three days earlier. After securing the prize, Apollo set out after the xebec, sighting her an hour after daybreak. Apollo finally captured the xebec Marte, of 75 tons, <b>at</b> <b>three</b> <b>in</b> the afternoon. She had been sailing from Vera Cruz for Havana. Apollo towed Resolution until 27 November, when she lost her mast. Resolution was in such an irreparable state Halkett destroyed her. Then on 7 December Apollo captured the schooner St Joseph, of 70 tons.|$|E
25|$|On 7 April 1979, Hoveyda was {{transported to}} Qasr Prison, once a getaway palace for monarchs of the Qajar dynasty, but {{converted}} into a prison during the 1920s. By this time, he was now aware {{that there would be}} no mercy for him, and the whole charade would end in his own death. Quickly shuffled back in front of Khalkhali's tribunal, he once again heard the court's indictment <b>at</b> <b>three</b> <b>in</b> the afternoon. There is some speculation as to who ordered the resumption of the trial. Bani Sadr, one among many leaders of the Provisional Revolutionary Government who advocated a public trial, states that only Khomeini himself had the authority to make such an order. Behind locked doors, Hoveyda's fate, which had already been decided upon by Khomeini days earlier, was sealed.|$|E

25|$|Eduardo Rodríguez tossed 4 hitless innings {{before he}} was pulled with left {{hamstring}} tightness. Matt Barnes took over and carried the combined no-hitter into seventh, which was broken up by Steve Pearce. The Orioles eventually tied the game <b>at</b> <b>three</b> <b>in</b> that inning. With his second home run of the night, the first giving Boston a 3–0 lead in the fifth, Mookie Betts put the Red Sox up in front for good, scoring David Ortiz and driving in all five runs for his team. Betts became the 13th Red Sox player with back-to-back multiple home run games and the first after David Ortiz in 2014 against the Twins in Minneapolis. In a rain-shortened six inning affair, David Price pitched his second complete game of the season, allowing one run on four hits. Jackie Bradley Jr. drove in four of Boston's eight runs, including his 20th home run of the season. Sandy León also went deep with a blast onto Eutaw Street. With the win, the Red Sox put the Orioles to third place in the AL East for the first this season and are one game behind the division leading Blue Jays.|$|E
25|$|The Ducks–Sharks Conference Quarterfinals {{was only}} the second series in NHL history to pit two Californian teams against one another; the first took place in 1968–69 between the Los Angeles Kings and the Oakland Seals. The Ducks stunned the Sharks by winning {{the first two games}} in San Jose 2–0 and 3–2. Jonas Hiller took over the {{starting}} job from Giguere and recorded his first NHL playoff shutout. Back at home for Game 3, the game was tied <b>at</b> <b>three</b> <b>in</b> the third period when Corey Perry took a hooking penalty and Patrick Marleau scored on the ensuing power play to win the game. Game 4 was completely dominated by the Ducks, prevailing 4–0. The first chance for the Ducks to eliminate the Sharks came in Game 5 at San Jose which went into overtime where once again Marleau was the hero after scoring the game-winner. In Game 6, the Ducks received goals from Perry, Selanne, Beauchemin and Getzlaf to win the game 4–1 and the series four games to two. The Ducks became just the fourth team to beat the Presidents' Trophy winner in the playoffs' first round. In the Conference Semifinals, the Ducks faced a familiar foe in the Detroit Red Wings. In Game 1, Nicklas Lidstrom scored in the final minute to win it for Detroit, 3–2. In Game 2, Todd Marchant scored in triple overtime to even the series at one game apiece. It was the first playoff game to go at least three overtimes for the Ducks since game one of the 2003 Conference Semifinals against Dallas. (That game had ended after five overtime periods.) The Ducks won Game 3 on a controversial goal scored by Marian Hossa. The referee claimed to have blown the whistle before the puck went in. Game 4 was all Detroit by a final score of 6–3. Hiller was pulled in the third period after giving up five goals. A pivotal Game 5 was won by the Red Wings, 4–1. However, the Ducks evened the series at three with a 2–1 win the game six. In the Ducks' first Game 7 since the 2006 Conference Quarterfinals against Calgary, Detroit got out to a 2–0 lead. Selanne then scored a power play goal to cut the lead, but Detroit scored again to make it 3–1. Perry scored next to trim the lead to 3–2 and in the third period, Ryan scored to tie the game at 3–3. Detroit's Daniel Cleary, however, scored with three minutes left in regulation to end the Ducks' season.|$|E
500|$|Desert Strike {{underwent}} {{few changes}} from the plans {{outlined in the}} original design documents. The initial concept involved smoothly animated vehicles on an isometric playing field. The developers also aimed to include cinematic scenes, similar to The Revenge of Shinobis introduction sequence. The game began development some time before any discussion of an American invasion of Iraq, originally based on the Lebanese Civil War and titled Beirut Breakout; this was later changed to the Persian Gulf region. John Manley recalled, [...] "We actually wrote most of Desert Strike before Desert Shield happened. We were watching CNN <b>at</b> <b>three</b> <b>in</b> the afternoon {{and all of a}} sudden it was like, 'Oh my god - it's happening!'" [...] A special point system intended to punish players was omitted; the system would have deducted points from the player's score if they destroyed objects that resulted in negative economic and political results. The control scheme was not well received at internal reviews of the game's early versions, and Posehn had to alter his original design to obtain approval for further development.|$|E

By the time the group came to record Phantom Power they were anxious to release the song, however Ciaran was reluctant to leave it in its original form and encouraged {{the rest of the}} band to jam over his original track. According to singer Gruff Rhys the instrumentation was recorded [...] "pretty much live" [...] after which lyrics were written and the band's 10-minute jam session was [...] "chopped ... up and made into a composed song" [...] with the electronic section intact. Strings were later added by Sean O'Hagan.
