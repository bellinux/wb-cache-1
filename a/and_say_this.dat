The bill is cosponsored by Senators Don Benton and Pam Roach. Earlier in February, Rivers also introduced legislation attempting to lower restrictions on initiatives in Washington State, commenting, [...] "If the people {{take the time to}} sign their name <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> is something {{we need to have a}} look at, we ought to respect that." [...] Along with cosponsors Roach and Benton, Tim Eyman also is cosponsoring the legislation. In March 2013, Rivers reprimanded senate Democrats for taking advantage of Janéa Holmquist Newbry's departure from the senate floor to feed her newborn son, leaving the Democrats in temporary control of the senate floor. Immediately after she left, Democrat David Frockt attempted to pass a bill through the floor. As part of her duties, Rivers has also hosted high-school aged pages for the Washington State Senate Page Program.|$|E

2500|$|The love {{of animals}} is not {{necessarily}} sexual in nature. In psychology and sociology the word [...] "zoophilia" [...] is sometimes used without sexual implications. Being fond of animals in general, or as pets, is accepted in Western society, and is usually respected or tolerated. However, the word zoophilia is used to mean a sexual preference towards animals, which makes it [...] a paraphilia. Some zoophiles may not act on their sexual attraction to animals. People who identify as zoophiles may feel their love for animals is romantic rather than purely sexual, <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> makes them different from those committing entirely sexually motivated acts of bestiality.|$|E
2500|$|On November 27, 2012, {{a federal}} judge entered an order {{granting}} preliminary approval to a proposed settlement to a class-action lawsuit filed in 2005 by merchants and trade associations against MasterCard, Visa, and many credit card issuers. The suit was filed due to price fixing and other anti-competitive trade practices employed by MasterCard and Visa. A majority of named class plaintiffs have objected and vowed {{to opt out of}} the settlement. Opponents object to provisions that would bar future lawsuits and even prevent merchants from opting out of significant portions of the proposed settlement. Stephen Neuwirth, a lawyer representing Home Depot, said, [...] "It’s so obvious Visa and MasterCard were prepared to make a large payment because of the scope of the releases being given. It’s all one quid pro quo and merchants like the Home Depot are being denied the chance to opt out of that quid pro quo <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> is a bad deal." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{subsequent}} {{civil case}} trial {{was held in}} 1998 with the charges that the Ku Klux Klan incited the crime. The case was brought to court by the Southern Poverty Law Center, represented by attorney Morris Dees. The lawyer for the Klan insisted that the criminals acted alone in burning down the church. Defense attorney Gary White painted the Klan Grand Dragon Horace King as a feeble old man merely exercising his right to free speech, saying King never authorized the arson. During the trial, the Church's lawyers showed racist Klan posters and literature and played a videotape for the jury showing King speaking at a Klan rally, saying [...] "It's time, people, {{to wake up and}} shape up <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> is our country, white people, take it back." [...] The Klan leaders insisted that they never encouraged anyone to break the law, but two of the sentenced arsonists testified against their case. Welch testified, [...] "The church fire was Klan business, and we were told we would not go to jail. We were convinced we were untouchable." [...] Both Welch and Cox said that they testified against the Klan to atone for what they'd done.|$|E

In November 2014, at the Halifax International Security Forum, Kaine, together with Senator John McCain, emphasized the necessity of such a congressional authorization, saying: [...] "You just can't have a war without Congress. You can't ask people to risk their lives, risk getting killed, seeing other folks getting killed or injured if Congress isn't willing to do the job to put their thumbprint on this <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> <b>this</b> is a national mission and worth it." [...] After the April 2017 Shayrat missile strike in Syria, ordered by President Donald Trump, Kaine said: [...] "There is no legal justification for this. He should not have done this without coming to Congress." [...] On Meet the Press, Kaine stated: [...] "I'm a strong supporter that the U.S. should take action to protect humanitarian causes, like the ban on chemical weapons. Where I differ from this administration, and I took the same position with respect to President Obama, we are a nation that's not supposed to take military action, start war, without a plan that's presented to and approved by Congress." ...|$|E
