500|$|On 1 November, Benfica hosted Celtic; {{they scored}} two {{goals in the}} first 25 minutes and a third through Andrei Karyaka in the 90th minute, winning by the same margin they had lost in Glasgow. Santos was happy with the win, saying, [...] "We knew he had three 'finals' <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> two. We are better now, with four points and closing in on Celtic." [...] Four days later, Benfica hosted [...] Beira-Mar for a Primeira Liga match. Benfica did not score until the second half, when in the 51st minute, Katsouranis headed in the match's first goal. Three minutes later, Petit scored the second and an own-goal from Beira-Mar made the score 3–0.|$|E
500|$|Two {{day after}} the game, Crusinberry wrote a column in the Chicago Daily Tribune opining that Michigan's offense was the {{culmination}} of the new, less brutish game of football:"The old time player, who did his stuff by brute strength, has given way to the modern man with a head full of tricks[...] [...] [...] <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> Mr. Yost's new Michigan team, with not a Grange on it, but with one of the brainiest players of the age in Benny Friedman and a lot of smart fellows to work with him. [...] Before Benny Friedman ends his career all the teams of the country, even the Navy, will have abandoned the old style football and will be using, or at least trying to use, smart and unexpected stuff. [...] It gains ground, it is spectacular, and it wins." ...|$|E
500|$|When Taylor {{said the}} moves detracted from Hương and Suu's powers, the {{officers}} disagreed {{and said they}} supported the pair in full and that Hương had approved of the HNC's dissolution. Taylor was unimpressed by the reassurances, concluding with [...] "I don't know whether {{we will continue to}} support you after this...You people have broken a lot of dishes <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to see how we can straighten out this mess." [...] Taylor's deputy, U. Alexis Johnson felt the discussion had become counterproductive and was increasing the problem. He suggested that should the generals feel unwilling to alter their position immediately, they should refrain from actions that would preclude a later change of heart. He proposed they merely announce the removal of certain members of the HNC rather than the dissolution of the entire body, hoping the HNC could be reconstituted with figures they deemed to be more satisfactory. The four officers did not give a clear answer to Johnson's idea, indicating they had not made a concrete decision by saying [...] "the door is not closed".|$|E

500|$|The Saint John Mill Rats {{moved to}} the newly created National Basketball League of Canada (NBL) for the 2011–12 season. Anderson debuted in the league debut by {{recording}} 14 points, 5 assists, and 3 steals in a 96–112 loss to the Summerside Storm on November 4, 2011. In a rematch with the same team less than one week later, he posted 25 points, although his team was still defeated by one point. Anderson scored a season-high 35 points in a 106–90 win over the Storm on November 17, hitting three of four three-pointers. He recorded 20 {{points in the second}} half alone. After leading his team in points in three of four games, Anderson earned Player of the Week honors on November 20. The point guard posted his first double-double of the season with 10 points and 10 assist in a 5-point victory over the Halifax Rainmen on December 2, despite making no treys. He was effective again on December 29, scoring 31 points vs. the London Lightning and adding 11 assists. However, on January 3, 2012, Anderson injured his hand in a defeat to the Moncton Miracles and was expected to be sidelined for three to four weeks. General manager Ian McCarthy said, [...] "This really stung because we were unable to finish the game strong against Moncton with Anthony out, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a road game 48 hours later against a tough Quebec team." [...] The Mill Rats responded by signing two players, including Darren Duncan. Anderson returned to the court in a rematch with the Miracles on February 1, notching 15 points and 7 assists. In the remainder of the regular season, he recorded 2 double-doubles and had three games in which he scored 20 or more points. In Game 1 of the NBL Canada Playoffs vs the London Lightning, Anderson recorded 26 points and 12 assists, going 6-of-7 from beyond the arc and 4-of-4 on free throws. He put up another 19 points in the second game. However, Saint John was swept 0–2 in the best-of-3 series and London {{went on to win the}} 2012 NBL Canada Finals.|$|E
2500|$|The {{national}} {{teams had}} met before their 1966 clash — Argentina {{were the first}} team other than Scotland to play England at Wembley Stadium in 1951 when the inaugural full international match between the sides ended with a 2–1 victory for England. They also played two matches in 1953 in Buenos Aires. The first, a 3–1 victory for Argentina, was considered an unofficial international by England, who fielded a second-string team dubbed an FA XI. However, this match appears in Argentina's list of official internationals, and is listed as a full international by FIFA, and so Argentines consider it to be their first ever victory over England. Afterwards, one Argentine politician stated that [...] "we nationalised the railways, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> nationalised football!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{frequently}} {{being considered}} {{as part of}} the gothic rock genre, Sain did not view the music as such, though he did credit its listeners with discovering many noteworthy bands: [...] "Goth is an important doorway for lots of things that would not be accepted easily anywhere else. For example, who were the first people to embrace the Sugarcubes? Goths. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a megastar of Björk. Pixies 1988? Gothic audience, not fratboys. Einsturzende Neubaten walked in through the [...] "gothic" [...] door—Miranda Sex Garden—Cocteau Twins.

I just like to play interesting music. It just so happens to be the 'goths' who are listening." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s {{computer}} programming was {{in state of}} crisis. Software crisis is a term used {{in the early days}} of computing science for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient computer programs in the required time. The software crisis was due to the rapid increases in computer power and the complexity of the problems that could be tackled. With the increase in the complexity of the software, many software problems arose because existing methods were neither sufficient nor up to the mark. The term [...] "software crisis" [...] was coined by some attendees at the first NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968 at Garmisch, Germany. His 1972 ACM Turing Award Lecture makes reference to this same problem: [...] "The major cause of the software crisis is that the machines have become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> gigantic computers, programming has become an equally gigantic problem." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1991 {{a number}} of party venues closed, {{including}} Ufo, and the Berlin Techno scene centered itself around three locations close to {{the foundations of the}} Berlin Wall: Planet (later renamed E-Werk by Paul van Dyk), Der Bunker, and the relatively long-lived Tresor. It was in Tresor at this time that a trend in paramilitary clothing was established (amongst the techno fraternity) by a DJ called Tanith; possibly as an expression of a commitment to the underground aesthetic of the music, or perhaps influenced by UR's paramilitary posturing. In the same period, German DJs began intensifying the speed and abrasiveness of the sound, as an acid infused techno began transmuting into hardcore. DJ Tanith commented at the time that [...] "Berlin was always hardcore, hardcore hippie, hardcore punk, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a very hardcore house sound." [...] This emerging sound is thought to have been influenced by Dutch gabber and Belgian hardcore; styles that were in their own perverse way paying homage to Underground Resistance and Richie Hawtin's Plus 8 Records. Other influences on the development of this style were European Electronic Body Music (EBM) groups of the mid-1980s such as DAF, Front 242, and Nitzer Ebb.|$|E
2500|$|Khánh's {{quartet of}} delegates responded to Taylor by {{responding}} in a circumlocutory way. They remained calm {{and did not}} resort to direct confrontation. Kỳ said the change was necessary, as [...] "the political situation is worse than it ever was under Diệm". Kỳ explained that the situation mandated {{the dissolution of the}} council, saying [...] "We know you want stability, but you cannot have stability until you have unity". He claimed that some HNC members were disseminating coup rumors and creating doubt among the population and that [...] "both military and civilian leaders regard the presence of these people in the High National Council as divisive of the Armed Forces due to their influence". Kỳ then promised that he would explain the decision at a media conference and that he and his colleagues would return to their military roles in the near future. Thiệu said [...] "I do not see how our action has hurt the Hương government ... Hương now has the full support of the Army and has no worries from the High National Council, which we have eliminated". When Taylor said that the moves detracted from Hương and Sửu's powers, the generals disagreed, and said that they supported the pair in full and that Hương had approved of the deposal of the HNC. Taylor was unimpressed by the reassurances, saying at the meeting's end, [...] "I don't know whether we will continue to support you after this ... ou people have broken a lot of dishes <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to see how we can straighten out this mess".|$|E
