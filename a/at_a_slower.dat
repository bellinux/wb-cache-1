The lower reaches of the watershed are the most heavily urbanized, while the upper reaches are still largely rural. This has been the case as early 1893.

5|$|Although {{societal}} {{awareness of}} AIDS had developed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> pace in Canada {{than in the}} United States, films regarding the disease had appeared nearly concurrently: both the first Canadian documentary and the first American feature-length film on the subject, Nik Sheehan's No Sad Songs and John Erman's An Early Frost respectively, were released in 1985. However, {{the majority of the}} early gay artists with AIDS had died by the time Hoolboom made Frank's Cock; as such, the film scholar Thomas Waugh considers Hoolboom a second-generation figurehead in AIDS activism and one of the earliest not coming from the gay community.|$|E
5|$|Musical {{instruments}} developed independently in many populated {{regions of}} the world. However, contact among civilizations caused rapid spread and adaptation of most instruments in places far from their origin. By the Middle Ages, instruments from Mesopotamia were in maritime Southeast Asia, and Europeans played instruments from North Africa. Development in the Americas occurred <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> pace, but cultures of North, Central, and South America shared musical instruments. By 1400, musical instrument development slowed in many areas and was dominated by the Occident.|$|E

5|$|Rural {{areas in}} South Dakota are {{experiencing}} a trend of falling populations, despite an overall increase in population. The effect of rural flight {{has not been}} spread evenly through South Dakota, however. Although most rural counties and small towns have lost population, the Sioux Falls area and the Black Hills have gained population. In fact, Lincoln County, near Sioux Falls, is the ninth fastest-growing county (by percentage) in the United States. The growth in these areas has compensated for losses {{in the rest of}} the state, and South Dakota's total population continues to increase steadily, albeit <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> rate than the national average.|$|E
5|$|Statistician Jeff Sonas, in {{examining}} data from 266,000games played between 1994 and 2001, concluded that White scored 54.1767% plus 0.001164 times White's Elo rating advantage, treating White's rating advantage as +390 {{if it is}} better than +390, or −460 if it is worse than −460. He found that White's advantage is equivalent to 35 rating points, i.e. if White has a rating 35points below Black's, each player will have an expected score of 50%. Sonas also found that White's advantage is smaller (53%) in rapid games than in games <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> ("classical") time control. In the 462 games played at the 2009 World Blitz Chess Championship, White scored only 52.16% (W38.96 D26.41 L 34.63).|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} rural flight {{has not been}} spread evenly through South Dakota, however. Although most rural {{counties}} and small towns have lost population, the Sioux Falls area, the larger counties along Interstate 29, the Black Hills, and many Indian reservations have all gained population. As the reservations have exercised more sovereignty, some Sioux have returned to them from urban areas. Lincoln County near Sioux Falls was the seventh fastest-growing county (by percentage) in the United States in 2010. The growth in these areas has compensated for losses {{in the rest of}} the state. South Dakota's total population continues to increase steadily, albeit <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> rate than the national average.|$|E

5|$|After lunch, Hutton rocked {{onto the}} front foot, played outside a Johnson off break and was bowled for 20 to leave England at 2/32. The English opener had been {{uncertain}} against Johnson's spin and played forward too early <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> ball, which went between a gap between his bat and pad. Later in the afternoon, Denis Compton and captain Norman Yardley played Johnson cautiously but safely; in particular, Yardley repeatedly driving a series of overpitched balls from Johnson for runs. Johnson took the last two wickets to fall on the second day, having Alec Coxon caught and bowled for 19 and Laker caught behind for 28 after the pair had put on 41. England were out early on the third morning for 215. Johnson ended with 3/72, having sent down 35 overs, the most by any Australian.|$|E
5|$|Increased wartime {{manufacturing}} and industrial growth in Hoosier {{cities and towns}} ushered {{in a new era}} of economic prosperity. By the end of the war, Indiana had become less rural that it previously had been. Overall, the war caused Indiana's industries to grow exponentially, although the state's southern counties experienced growth after the war <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> rate than its other counties. The state's population shifted to central and northern Indiana as new industries and cities began to develop around the Great Lakes and the railroad depots erected during the war. In 1876 Colonel Eli Lilly opened a new pharmaceutical laboratory in Indianapolis, founding what later became Eli Lilly and Company. Indianapolis was also the wartime home of Richard Gatling, inventor of the Gatling Gun, one of the world's first machine guns. Although his invention was used in some Civil War-era campaigns, it was not fully adopted for use by the U.S. Army until 1866. Charles Conn, another war veteran, founded C. G. Conn Ltd. in Elkhart, Indiana, where the manufacturing of musical instruments became a new industry for the town.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish monarchy {{appointed}} {{their own}} candidates {{to most of}} the political offices in the viceroyalty, usually favoring Spaniards from Europe. In most cases, the appointees had little knowledge of or interest in local issues. Consequently, there was a growing rivalry between criollos and peninsulars (those born in Spain). Most criollos thought that peninsulars had undeserved advantages and received preferential treatment in politics and society. The lower clergy had a similar sentiment about the higher echelons of the religious hierarchy. Events developed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> pace than in the United States independence movement. This was in part because the clergy controlled the entire educational system in Spanish America, which led the population to hold the same conservative ideas and follow the same customs as in Spain.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} tracked westward {{due to a}} {{ridge to}} its north. Its circulation was initially broad and ill defined, with patches of disorganized convection due to dry air. The depression was able to intensify due to generally favorable conditions, and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Ma-on at 0600UTC on July12. Gradually the thunderstorms became concentrated around the center, despite restricted outflow {{to the north and}} west. Ma-on intensified <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> than climatological rate, although an eye feature became evident by early on July13. At 0000UTC that day, the JMA upgraded Ma-on to a severe tropical storm, and 24hours later the storm intensified into a typhoon to the northeast of the Northern Marianas. By that time, it was also located about 970km (575mi) southeast of Iwo Jima. A ragged eye became apparent on satellite imagery, and after developing an anticyclone aloft, its outflow became much better defined.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} and revolves around a fictional conflict between the powers of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The player has the choice of choosing to control either NATO or Warsaw Pact forces {{at the beginning of}} the game. The player will begin the game on either side of Europe depending on which side was chosen; if NATO was picked, the player will start at western European countries (France, West Germany, Denmark) whereas if the player sides with the Warsaw Pact, the game will begin in eastern Europe. The map is hexagon-shaped and allows the player to move their units in six directions. Each side has a variety of units; infantry move <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> pace than mechanised infantry however armoured units are able to withstand more damage than regular units. The game displays two maps on screen; the larger, central map displays the current situation whereas a smaller map to the corner of the screen displays a mini-map of Europe, which runs north from Denmark to southern France.|$|E

5|$|The wooden mock-up {{was ready}} for {{inspection}} {{at the end of}} April, and work started on two prototypes late in May. The J79 engine was not yet ready, so both prototypes were instead designed to use the Wright J65, a licensed built version of the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire. Construction of the first prototype XF-104 (US serial number 53-7786, Buzz number FG-786) began in summer 1953 at Lockheed's Burbank, California factory. This aircraft was powered by a non-afterburning Buick-built Wright J65-B-3 turbojet. The first prototype was completed by early 1954, and started flying in March. The total time from award of the contract to first flight was only one year, a very short time even then, and unheard of today, when 10–15 years is more typical. Construction of the second prototype (s/n 53-7787) proceeded <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> pace.|$|E
5|$|When the {{luminosity}} of a TypeII supernova is plotted over {{a period}} of time, it shows a characteristic rise to a peak brightness followed by a decline. These light curves have an average decay rate of 0.008magnitudes per day; much lower than the decay rate for TypeIa supernovae. Type II are sub-divided into two classes, depending on the shape of the light curve. The light curve for a TypeII-L supernova shows a steady (linear) decline following the peak brightness. By contrast, the light curve of a TypeII-P supernova has a distinctive flat stretch (called a plateau) during the decline; representing a period where the luminosity decays <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> rate. The net luminosity decay rate is lower, at 0.0075magnitudes per day for TypeII-P, compared to 0.012magnitudes per day for TypeII-L.|$|E
5|$|After Hayden's departure, Ponting {{was joined}} by Martyn, who {{completed}} his half-century in 46 balls. Ponting scored <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> rate, reaching his 50 off 74 balls with one four. After completing his half century, he accelerated; he hit two sixes off Harbhajan and one off Ashish Nehra. The pair added 100 runs off 109 balls for the third wicket. Ponting reached his century quickly—his second fifty came off 29 balls. At {{the end of the}} innings, Australia had scored 359 runs for two wickets; Ponting had scored 140 not out (off 121 balls; four fours and eight sixes) and Martyn hit 88 not out (off 84 balls; seven fours and one six) respectively. As of the 2015 competition, Ponting's innings remains the highest individual score by a captain in a World Cup final, and Australia's total remains the highest by a team in a World Cup final. The 234-run stand between Ponting and Marytn was a record partnership for Australia in ODIs at that point in time. The Indian bowlers conceded 37 extras. Srinath conceded 87 runs without taking a wicket—the most expensive figures in his career—in what was his last international game.|$|E
