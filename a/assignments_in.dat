5|$|He drew two unusual <b>assignments</b> <b>in</b> 1934. When the USAAC {{took over}} flying the air mail, McClelland acted as zone {{communications}} officer at Salt Lake City. Later in the year, he was communications and meteorological officer for General Henry H. Arnold's Alaskan flight, {{which was to}} do much in shaping the trend of air communications.|$|E
5|$|He {{received}} a commission {{as a second}} lieutenant in the Marines in October 1917, and served in France and Germany in World War I. After the war he held several positions until going to flight school in 1922. After graduating flight school and being designated a Naval Aviator, he performed several <b>assignments</b> <b>in</b> Central America and China. It was in Central America where he received his first Navy Cross and the Nicaraguan Medal of Merit with Silver Star.|$|E
5|$|That same year, then-Lieutenant Olga E. Custodio {{became the}} first female Hispanic U.S. {{military}} pilot. Custodio studied at the University of Puerto Rico and joined their ROTC program. She graduated from the Officer Training School in January 1980, and was commissioned a second lieutenant. She holds {{the distinction of being}} first Latina to complete U.S. Air Force undergraduate pilot training (UPT). One of her <b>assignments</b> <b>in</b> the military was that of instructor pilot where she was the first female Northrop T-38 Talon UPT flight instructor at Laughlin AFB.

40|$|The major {{debate on}} primary stress <b>assignment</b> <b>in</b> Brazilian Portuguese (BP) {{concerns}} {{whether it is}} lexically given or predictable {{by a set of}} principles. This paper presents a contribution to this debate by suggesting a usage-based approach to stress <b>assignment</b> <b>in</b> BP. It is argued that stress assignment is better accounted for as the result of generalizations over exemplars, and these generalizations are responsible for the main tendencies regarding stress <b>assignment</b> <b>in</b> the language...|$|R
40|$|We {{deal with}} the problem of {{frequency}} <b>assignment</b> <b>in</b> mobile and general radio networks, where the signal interferences are modeled using an interference graph G. Our approach uses graph theoretic and optimization techniques. We first study on-line algorithms for frequency <b>assignment</b> <b>in</b> mobile networks. We prove that the greedy algorithm is Δ-competitive, where Δ is the maximum degree of G. We next employ the "classify and randomly select" paradigm to give a 5 -competitive randomized algorithm for the case of planar interference graphs. We also show how the problem of on-line frequency <b>assignment</b> <b>in</b> mobile networks with multiple available frequency channels reduces to the problem of on-line frequency <b>assignment</b> <b>in</b> mobile networks with a single channel. We continue to study radio coloring and radio labeling as combinatorial models for frequency <b>assignment</b> <b>in</b> general radio networks. In both problems, the objective is to minimize the maximum frequency channel used, w [...] ...|$|R

5|$|The Civilian Public Service (CPS) was {{a program}} of the United States {{government}} that provided conscientious objectors with an alternative to military service during World War II. From 1941 to 1947, nearly 12,000 draftees, willing to serve their country in some capacity but unwilling to perform any type of military service, accepted <b>assignments</b> <b>in</b> work of national importance in 152 CPS camps throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. Draftees from the historic peace churches and other faiths worked {{in areas such as}} soil conservation, forestry, fire fighting, agriculture, under the supervision of such agencies as the U.S. Forest Service, the Soil Conservation Service, and the National Park Service. Others helped provide social services and mental health services.|$|E
5|$|From 1769 to 1778, Schmitt was {{assigned}} to the Turkish border areas, and was especially active in Temesvar, in the Banat, bordering the Ottoman Empire. In 1778, he was promoted to captain and mobilized against Prussia during the short War of the Bavarian Succession, after which he transferred back to the Balkan border areas, where he stayed until 1782. His thorough knowledge of the country guaranteed him map-making and intelligence <b>assignments</b> <b>in</b> Turkish-occupied Bosnia to gather information in preparation for an upcoming new war against Turkey. In particular, he developed material on the Turk's military situation. His work on the development of intelligence of Turkish strength in Osijek and Alt Gradiska satisfied his superiors and when the war actually broke out in 1787, he {{was assigned}} to the General Staff of the Slavonion Corps. He participated in the storming of the fortress at Šabac, in Serbia, on 24 April 1788. Emperor Joseph II promoted him personally to major on 14 May 1788. In 1789, Schmitt fought at the Siege of Belgrade, and on 23 February 1790, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In March 1790, he transferred to Bohemia, under command of Field Marshal Ernst Gideon von Laudon, for anticipated action against the Kingdom of Prussia. When this war came to naught, he was transferred to the Austrian Netherlands in 1791, to help contain a local uprising.|$|E

40|$|According to Smith (1977), stress <b>assignment</b> <b>in</b> Batticaloa Creole Portuguese (BCP) {{is fully}} predictable: stress {{falls on the}} last {{underlying}} long vowel of a word, or on the first short vowel of a word having no long vowel. BCP has phonemic vowel length, although long vowels only surface when they are stressed in a word-initial syllable. Elsewhere, they are shortened. Stress <b>assignment</b> <b>in</b> these cases involves opacity, a phenomenon that challenges output-oriented Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 1993). Opaque stress <b>assignment</b> <b>in</b> BCP is analyzed within McCarthy's (1998) original formulation of Sympathy theory, his revised proposal of Sympathy theory (McCarthy 1999), and local conjunction. It is demonstrated that only McCarthy's original proposal for Sympathy theory can account for opaque stress <b>assignment</b> <b>in</b> BCP. This is taken as support for the notion of candidate-to-candidate faithfulness, the kernel of McCarthy's original Sympathy proposal...|$|R
