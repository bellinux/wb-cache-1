5|$|One of the {{families}} targeted in the Kandahar shootings {{had returned to the}} area in 2011 after previously being displaced by the surge. Fearing the Taliban but encouraged by the U.S. government, the Army, and the Afghan government, they settled near the U.S. military base because they thought it would to be <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> live.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{was still}} {{going on in the}} area around Dongo. Fearing that Mussolini and Petacci might be rescued by fascist supporters, the partisans drove them, {{in the middle of the}} night, to a nearby farm of a peasant family named De Maria; they {{believed}} this would be <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> hold them. Mussolini and Petacci spent the rest of the night and most of the following day there.|$|E
5|$|Following the Games, she hid {{away from}} {{athletics}} following threats by militant group Al-Shabaab. She {{ended up in}} a Hizbul-Islam displacement camp, and in pursuit of competing at the 2012 Summer Olympics, she crossed the border to Ethiopia looking for <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> train. She was trafficked north into Libya, where she was imprisoned. During the 2012 Games, it was revealed that Omar had drowned off the coast of Libya while attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Italy.|$|E

There {{at the foot of the}} downs where a big tree gave an air of shelter she rested for a space on a stile.|$|R
5|$|Although {{civilian}} evacuations {{had begun}} in January for the Gulf Coast and San Antonio de Béxar, the Texian military was either on the offensive or standing firm until the smaller Gulf Coast skirmishes happened in February. Houston was now facing a choice of whether to retreat to <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> train his new army, or to meet the enemy head-on immediately. He was wary of trying to defend a fixed position – the debacle at the Alamo had shown that the new Texian government was unable to provide sufficient provisions or reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century Jacobite Risings, Orkney {{was largely}} Jacobite in its sympathies. At {{the end of}} the 1715 rebellion, a large number of Jacobites who had fled north from {{mainland}} Scotland sought refuge on Orkney and were helped on to safety in Sweden. In 1745, the Jacobite lairds on the islands ensured that Orkney remained pro-Jacobite in outlook, and was <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> land supplies from Spain to aid their cause. Orkney was the last place in the British Isles that held out for the Jacobites and was not retaken by the British Government until 24 May 1746, over a month after the defeat of the main Jacobite army at Culloden.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} World War II in 1939, SBC, {{like other}} Swiss banks, was the {{recipient}} of large influxes of foreign funds for safekeeping. Just prior to {{the outbreak of the}} war, SBC made the timely decision to open an office in New York City. The office, located in the Equitable Building, was able to begin operations {{a few weeks after the}} outbreak of the war and was intended as <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> store assets in the case of an invasion. During the war, the banks' traditional business fell off and the Swiss government became their largest client.|$|E
50|$|Northfields {{has had a}} bad {{reputation}} for criminal activities. Despite being only 3 small estates it was responsible for 30% of the crime rate within the Leicester area. In response The Northfields Project {{was set up in}} order to help to combat crime and make Northfields <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> live. The scheme improved areas such as security fencing, lighting and public recreational spaces.|$|R
5000|$|The {{baby boom}} {{was the result}} of couples holding off on having {{children}} due to the Great Depression and World War II. Once the baby boom began, the average woman started getting married around the age of 20 instead of 22. Couples were eager to have babies after the war ended because they knew that the world would be <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> start <b>a</b> family.|$|R
50|$|During the post-election violence, M-Pesa {{was used}} to {{transfer}} money to people trapped in Nairobi's slums at the time. Some Kenyans regarded M-PESA as <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> store their money than the banks, which were entangled in ethnic disputes. Having established a base of initial users, M-PESA then benefitted from network effects: the more people who used it, the more it made sense for others {{to sign up for}} it.|$|R
5|$|The algae {{benefit from}} <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> live and consume the polyp's {{carbon dioxide and}} {{nitrogenous}} waste. Due to the strain the algae can put on the polyp, stress on the coral often drives them to eject the algae. Mass ejections are known as coral bleaching, because the algae contribute to coral's brown coloration; other colors, however, are due to host coral pigments, such as green fluorescent proteins (GFPs). Ejection increases the polyp's chance of surviving short-term stress—they can regain algae, possibly of a different species at a later time. If the stressful conditions persist, the polyp eventually dies.|$|E
25|$|In mid-June 2013, the U.S. {{government}} {{said it would}} now arm rebels in Syria; besides, the U.S- was considering a no-fly zone in Syria′s southern border with Jordan, which would allow <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> equip and train rebels.|$|E

25|$|In September 1831, Hall {{was among}} twenty-five {{founding}} members elected {{to serve on}} the board of the newly formed Wilmington Savings Fund Society, a community bank designed to provide persons with only modest savings <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> deposit their funds. On October 1, 1831, Hall was elected president of the bank, a position he held until 1872, when he retired at the age of 92.|$|E
25|$|By October, {{customers}} {{appeared to}} be regaining confidence in the bank, when it emerged {{that there had been}} a surge in the number of new accounts which had been opened. People perceived Northern Rock as <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> put their money, given that it was currently government owned. However, there was no guarantee that if Northern Rock was to fail that the government would top-up any compensation over and above the standard £85,000 offered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.|$|E

While on leave in Berlin in 1942, he started covertly assisting Jews when he found a Jewish woman, Marianne Hirschfeld, about to leap from a bridge. Risking court-martial and execution, he sheltered her in his apartment before giving her money <b>to</b> find <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> stay. They married after the war.|$|R
50|$|It is {{the hope}} of the Mental Health Society {{to improve the lives of}} those {{affected}} by mental illness. With specific attention to Acadia students, the society strives to do this in a variety of ways empowering students to get involved in ways that are meaningful to them. Most importantly, the combination of all the activities held by the MHS as a whole and its presence on campus have made Acadia <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> talk about mental health.|$|R
25|$|By October {{customers}} {{appeared to}} be regaining confidence in the bank, when it emerged {{that there had been}} a surge in the number of new accounts which had been opened. People appeared to see Northern Rock as <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> put their money, given the current status as a nationalised bank which cannot fail. The bank decided to remove some of their savings products from the market, as the bank has a commitment to take only a 1.5% share of total UK retail deposits.|$|E
25|$|In popular {{literature}} {{firefighters are}} sometimes depicted with Dalmatian dogs. This breed originated in southern Europe and was {{primarily responsible for}} herding livestock and running alongside carriages drawn by horses. In the days of horse-drawn fire vehicles, the horses were usually released on arrival at the fire and the Dalmatians would lead the horses through traffic and to <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> wait until the fire was out. Dalmatians also filled the role of protecting the horses' feet from other dogs as equipment was being transported to the fire scene.|$|E
25|$|When picking your {{starting}} countries {{look for}} high wheat or gold production and pass on 2s and 3s. When expanding into neutral countries all the high production countries are usually already taken. Look instead {{to expand into}} countries with 3 or 2 cities spaces while being defensible from the other players. Basically you’re looking for <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> build palaces and churches without worrying about them being stolen away or devastated {{in the remainder of}} the game. These are the countries where you’ll be too busy with building actions to use them for gold or wheat actions.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} safety {{engineering}} provided {{much of the}} inspiration for transition engineering. At {{the beginning of the}} 1900s, business owners viewed workplace safety as a wasted investment and politicians were slow to change. After the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire in New York City killed 156 trapped workers, 62 engineers came together to investigate how to make the workplace <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> be. This eventually lead to the formation of the American Society of Safety Engineers.|$|R

25|$|Larval {{dispersion}} {{patterns of}} C. megacephala {{also make it}} forensically important. Knowing that, to pupate, larvae {{move away from the}} food source to find <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> metamorphose, forensic entomologists can accurately calculate a post mortem interval. Knowledge of larval competition is also useful in forensic studies, because it could affect the estimate of the time of death. If only C. rufifacies is found on a body, it is not accurate to use only this species to calculate a time of colonization. The colonization of C. megacephala prior to C. rufifacies must be taken into account.|$|E
25|$|Cholesbury {{stands at}} the {{crossroads}} of several droving routes, the Commons providing <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> rest their animals. In turn this regular traffic supported local trades and several alehouses over the years. By 1753 The Castle, the Maidenhead (later the Bricklayers Arms), next door to it the Queen's Head and The Slip Inn were operating for at least a period. They were able to flourish due to the boost in trade between the 18th and {{the early part of the}} 20th centuries when they were also frequented by the growing numbers of brickyard and agricultural labourers. None of these public houses has survived to the present day.|$|E
25|$|While {{growing up}} Davis {{was known as}} Little Pops. His second home was the Phyllis Wheatley {{settlement}} house. Its director Gertrude Brown gave the area's children continuing education in <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> go after school. Davis must have gotten into trouble at some point {{as it was a}} juvenile parole officer who suggested he attend Phyllis Wheatley. There with his friends, Davis learned boxing, etiquette and Robert's Rules of Order. They met Chick Webb and danced to Duke Ellington and Count Basie who stayed there on tours to the Orpheum Theatre. In 1941, he graduated from North High School where he lettered in and won a city championship in boxing. Davis attended the University of Minnesota and later in life received an honorary doctorate in law from Macalester College.|$|E

50|$|Crawford's {{football}} career {{started when}} he was instructed by the local constabulary to stop playing football on the roads. The local Phoenix Park provided <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> kickabout and he was soon spotted there by scouts from Bulfin United, a feeder club for St Patrick's Athletic. Crawford soon moved on to St.Patricks and whilst there he achieved several major honours including LFA President's Cup, FAI Intermediate Cup, two League of Ireland winners medals (1954-55 and 1955-56), and an FAI Cup runners up medal in 1954.|$|R
50|$|Galdogob {{also has}} a {{thriving}} livestock industry: {{hundreds of thousands of}} camels, sheep, goats and cattle are purchased here and shipped through the busy port of Bosaso every year. The city's livestock trade is at its most brisk during the hajj period, when over a hundred thousand heads of livestock are sold and shipped to the Gulf states, again through Bosaso. Galdogob has recently also seen the arrival of migrants from the more southernly areas of Somalia seeking work and <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> live.|$|R
