500|$|Roger Ebert {{praised the}} film, giving it four stars {{out of a}} {{possible}} four and describing it as [...] "jolly and wicked, filled with sly in-jokes and yet somehow possessing a heart." [...] USA Todays Susan Wloszczyna praised Eddie Murphy's performance, stating it [...] "gives the comic performance of his career, aided by sensational digital artistry, as he brays for the slightly neurotic motormouth." [...] Richard Schickel of Time also enjoyed Murphy's role, stating [...] "No one has ever made a funnier jackass of himself than Murphy." [...] Peter Rainer of New York magazine liked the script, also stating [...] "The animation, directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, is often on the same wriggly, giggly level as the script, although the more [...] "human" [...] characters, such as Princess Fiona and Lord Farquaad, are less interesting than the animals and creatures—a common pitfall in animated films of all types." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote [...] "Shrek is a world-class charmer that could even seduce the Academy when it hands out the first official animation Oscar next year." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Shrek is not a guilty pleasure for sophisticated movie-goers; it is, purely and simply, a pleasure." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote [...] "The witty, fractured fairy tale Shrek has a solid base of clever writing." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A-, saying [...] "A kind of palace coup, a shout of defiance, and a coming of age for DreamWorks." [...] Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel wrote [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to report that the movie both captures and expands upon the book's playful spirit of deconstruction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Esquire also praised Day-Lewis' performance: [...] "what's most fun, {{albeit in}} a {{frightening}} way, is watching this greedmeister {{become more and}} more unhinged as he locks horns with Eli Sunday … both Anderson and Day-Lewis go for broke. But it's <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reminded, if only once every four years, that subtlety can be overrated." ...|$|E

2500|$|Egyptologists {{who knew}} Omm Sety were {{impressed}} by her knowledge of ancient Egypt. Klaus Baer of the Oriental Institute commented that [...] "she had visions and worshipped the ancient Egyptian gods. But she understood the methods and standards of scholarship, which is usually {{not the case with}} nuts," [...] nor did she [...] "desire to convert anyone." [...] Omm Sety was impressed by Hermann Junker, [...] "one of the elders of 20th century archaeology," [...] who had taught Selim Hassan. He advocated a more honest approach to the study of ancient Egyptian religion, believing that [...] "nobody had made a real effort to go deeply enough into it." [...] She admired his open-mindedness, especially since Junker was also a Catholic priest. [...] One noted Egyptologist, who didn't wish to be named, commented [...] "I was deeply shocked when, one night, I attended a party given by Dr. Ahmed Fakhry behind the Great Pyramid...and there under the full moon was Dorothy Eady belly dancing! I couldn't believe my eyes!"

6000|$|Pretty soon, also, {{there was}} likely to be an {{interview}} that would shake us all to our depths, and naturally, I was somber at heart. But though my outward mood of good humor may have been pretense, it certainly was <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with the girls again way out in the open. Both girls were quiet, and this made my task harder, and perhaps in my anxiety to ward off questions and appear happy for their own sakes I made an ass of myself with my silly talk and familiarity.

60|$|I'm {{ashamed to}} write it down; but I was really pleased to hear it. Nothing would have induced me to go voluntarily to their house with the {{intention}} of stopping there--for they were friends of Dr. Ivor's.

60|$|VI. He was of an {{innocent}} life, no busy-body, nor self-seeker: neither touchy nor critical: what fell from him was very inoffensive, if not very edifying. So meek, contented, modest, easy, steady, tender, it was <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in his company. He exercised no authority but over evil, and that everywhere, and in all; but with love, compassion, and long-suffering. A most merciful man, as ready to forgive, as unapt to take or give an offence. Thousands can truly say, he was of an excellent spirit and savour among them, and because thereof, the most excellent spirits loved him with an unfeigned and unfading love.|$|E

He made no inquiries touching the nature of my interview with those two gentlemen at the Hotel de la Couronne, and when {{at the moment of}} leaving I requested him to deliver a packet to the taller of those same two he did so without comment or question.
