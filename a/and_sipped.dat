5|$|In the 1960s, it was {{discovered}} that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides). MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the hepatic portal system rather than the lymphatic system. The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, Peter Huttenlocher devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, <b>and</b> <b>sipped</b> during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on twelve children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children. The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.|$|E

2500|$|Glazunov {{made his}} {{conducting}} debut in 1888. The following year, he conducted his Second Symphony in Paris at the World Exhibition. He was appointed conductor for the Russian Symphony Concerts in 1896. In March {{of that year}} he conducted the posthumous premiere of Tchaikovsky's student overture The Storm. In 1897, he led the disastrous premiere of Rachmaninoff's Symphony No 1. [...] This catalysed Rachmaninoff's three year depression. [...] The composer's wife later claimed that Glazunov seemed to be drunk at the time. While this assertion cannot be confirmed, it is not implausible for a man who, according to Shostakovich, kept a bottle of alcohol hidden behind his desk <b>and</b> <b>sipped</b> it through a tube during lessons.|$|E
40|$|Mobile IPv 6 <b>and</b> <b>SIP</b> are {{protocols}} {{designed to}} support {{different types of}} mobility. Mobile IPv 6 {{has been used to}} support mobility in IP networks <b>and</b> <b>SIP</b> has been used for voice over IP applications. It is the signalling protocol of the IP multimedia subsystem (IMS). In this paper both protocols have been simulated and compared in order to observe their performance for voice over IP (VoIP) applications. In this paper the architectures proposed by researchers in order to combine mobile IPv 6 <b>and</b> <b>SIP</b> have also been investigated and compared to analyse their advantages and disadvantages. A network scenario, running mobile IPv 6 <b>and</b> <b>SIP</b> for IMS, has also been simulated in order to evaluate the performance offered by the two protocols and to compare them with the results from the simulation of the pure mobile IPv 6 <b>and</b> <b>SIP</b> architectures. The comparison shows that the combined scenario offers better performance similar to the one obtained using only mobile IPv 6 with route optimization. The scenario simulated was also compared with the integrated architectures for mobile IPv 6 <b>and</b> <b>SIP</b> that were investigated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€” This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{assessment of the}} quality of mobile VoIP calls when carried out in Mobile IPv 6 <b>and</b> <b>SIP</b> mobility scenarios. The study shows that the current implementation of MIPv 6 <b>and</b> <b>SIP</b> mobility are not sufficient to provide acceptable voice quality, corresponding to a R-factor target of 70. However, the detailed evaluation of the factors that contribute to the total handoff latency allows the identification of various required performance enhancements. Various solutions are then proposed to adequate MIPv 6 <b>and</b> <b>SIP</b> mobility to support mobility of VoIP clients...|$|R

40|$|IP Telephony is a {{technology}} which uses internet and signalling protocols like H. 323 <b>and</b> <b>SIP</b> to setup <b>and</b> transfer voice signals from one destination to another. These protocols use various encoding schemes to transmit voice signals over the digital technology. The success of IP Telephony {{is the cost}} and time effectiveness; hence we studied on the call setup delay of these two signaling protocols H. 323 <b>and</b> <b>SIP.</b> H. 323 uses TCP <b>and</b> <b>SIP</b> uses UDP as transport protocols {{to set up a}} call. They have different scopes that distinguish them. The signalling protocols H. 323 <b>and</b> <b>SIP</b> call setup delays are observed and studied successfully between the traditional telephones and IP telephones. The call setup delay for H. 323 is analysed experimentally in the Cisco environment by establishing calls at various loads such as null load, medium load and heavy load. Due to practical difficulties the SIP call setup delay is studied only literally. The parameters that we considered for our experiments are the average call setup delay, bandwidth and different traffic loads. Finally, the results of both H. 323 <b>and</b> <b>SIP</b> are compared with each other to find out the best signalling protocol. The comparison is done according to the call setup delay and other factors like complexity, compatibility, reliability and bandwidth utilization...|$|R
