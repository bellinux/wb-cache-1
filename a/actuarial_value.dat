40|$|This paper derives the multi-period fair <b>actuarial</b> <b>values</b> for six {{deductible}} {{insurance policies}} offered in today's insurance markets. The loss {{in any given}} period is generated by the Weibull distribution with a known shape parameter but an unknown scale parameter. The insurer {{is assumed to be}} a Bayesian decision maker, in the sense that he/she learns sequentially about the unknown scale parameter by observing the realizations of the filed claims. It is shown that the insurer's underlying predictive loss distributions belong to the Burr family, and the multi-period actuarially fair policy value can be derived. With a proper loading, an insurance premium can be quoted. Our major contribution is the analytical derivations of the fair <b>actuarial</b> <b>values</b> for deductible insurance policies in the presence of parameter uncertainty and Bayesian learning.

According to Hawley, profit is the price paid by society for assuming business risk. A businessman would not take a risk without expecting compensation in excess of <b>actuarial</b> <b>value</b> i.e., a premium on calculable risk. The reason that expected profit must be more than actuarial risk is the assumption that risk gives rise to dis-utilities of various kinds.

The mortality law approach towards the mortality table is applied because the result is continuous. The mortality law approach can explain any phenomenon which happens in a population. The discrepancies between data which is approached by data from Makeham mortality law and mortality table can affect the accuracy in estimating actuarial functions and <b>actuarial</b> present <b>value</b> of benefit.

50|$|CBO BCRA June 26: CBO has {{provided}} a summary (table #5 on page 48) that compares premiums under current law (ACA) with the BCRA, for different ages and income levels, for bronze and silver plans. For example, a single individual 40 years old with annual income of $56,800 (375% of poverty level) would pay $5,000 for a bronze plan under BCRA vs. $5,500 under current law, but receives a lower <b>actuarial</b> <b>value</b> plan of 58 versus 60. For that person, silver plans would be basically identical in terms of cost and quality. Relative to current law, persons aged 64 years old would pay considerably more for either a bronze or silver plan under BCRA, while a 21 year old would pay considerably less under BCRA, {{due in part to}} relaxing the rules on how much more older persons can be charged relative to younger.|$|E
50|$|The <b>actuarial</b> present <b>value</b> (APV) is the {{expected}} {{value of the}} present value of a contingent cash flow stream (i.e. a series of payments {{which may or may not}} be made). <b>Actuarial</b> present <b>values</b> are typically calculated for the benefit-payment or series of payments associated with life insurance and life annuities.

[...] A court can also (regardless of the dollar amount) modify or terminate a trust or remove the trustee and appoint a different trustee if it determines that the value of the trust property is insufficient to justify the cost of administration. [...] Upon termination under these provisions, the trustee is to distribute the funds [...] "in a manner consistent with the purposes of the trust."

50|$|In 1997, the {{tax credit}} was {{scrapped}} for non-taxpayers (except charities and PEPs), which had a particular impact on pension funds, which could no longer claim a refund for any amount {{that had previously been}} paid as ACT. The effect of the change was that pension funds became effectively taxed on dividend income by way of the now non-refundable ACT, thus lowering pension returns and allegedly resulting in the winding up of some pension funds. Treasury argued that the change was crucial to long-term economic growth: the existing corporation tax system created biased incentives for corporations to pay out profits as dividends to shareholders (including pension funds, who could then reclaim the tax paid) rather than to reinvest them into company growth (which would result in corporation tax being paid). The old system of corporation tax was widely viewed by economists as a constraint on British economic growth. The Times obtained documents under the Freedom of Information Act in April 2007 that showed the chancellor Gordon Brown had been advised that pension funds would suffer a £67 billion loss of the <b>actuarial</b> <b>value</b> of their assets as a net result of a combination of policies including the ACT change.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{individual}} market, sometimes {{thought of as}} the [...] "residual market" [...] of insurance, insurers have generally used a process called underwriting to ensure that each individual paid for his or her <b>actuarial</b> <b>value</b> or to deny coverage altogether. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce found that, between 2007 and 2009, the four largest for-profit insurance companies refused insurance to 651,000 people for previous medical conditions, a number that increased significantly each year, with a 49% increase in that time period. The same memorandum said that 212,800 claims had been refused payment due to pre-existing conditions and that insurance firms had business plans to limit money paid based on these pre-existing conditions. These persons who might not have received insurance under previous industry practices are guaranteed insurance coverage under the ACA. Hence, the insurance exchanges will shift a greater amount of financial risk to the insurers, but will help to share the cost of that risk among a larger pool of insured individuals. The ACA's prohibition on denying coverage for pre-existing conditions began on January 1, 2014. Previously, several state and federal programs, including most recently the ACA, provided funds for state-run high-risk pools for those with previously existing conditions. Several states have continued their high-risk pools even after the first marketplace enrollment period.|$|E
40|$|Under some {{defined benefit}} pension plans (typically foreign plans), the <b>actuarial</b> present <b>value</b> of {{benefits}} {{to which an}} employee is entitled if the employee terminates immediately may exceed the <b>actuarial</b> present <b>value</b> of benefits to which the employee is entitled at expected date of separation based on service to date. For example, {{the provisions of the}} Italian severance pay statute require that, in most cases, the benefit an employee has accrued for service to date is payable immediately upon separation. The undiscounted value of that benefit payable currently would exceed the <b>actuarial</b> present <b>value</b> of that benefit if payment is estimated to occur at the employee's expected termination date. Another example arises in the United Kingdom where legislation requires that deferred vested benefits of terminated employees be statutorily revalued from date of separation to normal retirement age. If the vested benefit obligation (VBO) is determined assuming employee termination at the measurement date, that VBO could exceed the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) if that obligation is measured giving consideration to a statutory revaluation only after the employee's expected date of termination. The issue is whether the VBO is the <b>actuarial</b> present <b>value</b> of the vested benefits to which the employee is entitled if the employee separates immediately (Approach 1) or the <b>actuarial</b> present <b>value</b> of the vested benefits to which the employee is currently entitled but based on the employee's expected date of separation or retirement (Approach 2).

40|$|The U. S. {{market in}} subsidized {{commodity}} revenue insurance contracts has expanded rapidly since 1996.

The <b>actuarial</b> <b>value</b> of whole-farm insurance increases under a particular characterization of >more systematic= risk, whereas the <b>actuarial</b> <b>value</b> of insurance through crop-specific contracts need not change. Upon fixing stochastic revenue interactions, we identify conditions such that the expected cost of revenue insurance via crop-specific contracts is increasing under a more dispersed vector of location-and-scale adjusted revenue guarantee parameters. Then we identify two precise requirements such that the actuarial values of the two contract forms converge. To give insights on the difference, fair premiums for whole-farm and crop-specific contracts are compared for typical farms in two states. Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|E
