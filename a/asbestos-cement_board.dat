5000|$|Smoke-developed index (abbreviated SDI) is {{a measure}} of the {{concentration}} of smoke a material emits as it burns. Like Flame Spread Index, it is based on an arbitrary scale in which <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>board</b> has a value of 0, and red oak wood has 100. The SDI is measured using a horizontal test specimen, according to the Steiner tunnel test protocol.|$|E
50|$|The {{progress}} of the flame front across the test material is measured by visual observation, while the smoke emitted {{from the end of}} the test assembly is measured as a factor of optical density. A flame spread index (FSI) and a smoke-developed index are calculated from these results. Both indices use an arbitrary scale in which <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>board</b> has a value of 0, and red oak wood has 100.|$|E
50|$|When Indonesia {{joined the}} Colombo Plan in 1953, New Zealand quickly {{extended}} its Colombo Plan assistance to Indonesia. Under a technical assistance scheme, New Zealand sent experts to Indonesia while Indonesian trainees received training in New Zealand. New Zealand technical aid initiatives for Indonesia included {{the establishment of}} a technical trade training centre, short-term training courses for Indonesian dental nurses and dentists, the dispatch of New Zealand teachers to assist with English language teaching at teachers' colleges in Indonesia, and the construction of a Jakarta <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>board</b> factory. New Zealand's Colombo Plan capital assistance was hampered by limited funds on the New Zealand side and limited technical expertise on the Indonesian side. By 1960, New Zealand had sent 29 experts to Indonesia while 99 Indonesians had been given scholarships for training in New Zealand.|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} {{technology of}} protective decorative coatings for <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>boards</b> {{carried out with}} the use of powder polyester paints of domes tic manufacture is described. The technology was implemented in productive conditions of the Open Joint Stock Company “Krichevcementnoshifer”. The results of testing of <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>boards</b> with polymeric coatings of blue, green and dark-red colours are presented. The testing was carried out for adhesion, frost- and heat-resistance, abrasive resistance, resistance to variable temperatures, accelerated weathering, water-resistance, colour fastness. It is shown that the complex of performa nce characteristics of the pilot lot of <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>boards</b> with polymeric coatings corresponds to the requirements of STB 1118 - 98...|$|R
5000|$|... "During {{my first}} year, {{teaching}} in his school for no-hope kids, I became ever {{so close to}} him. He talked only when necessary, and people would complain about having gone for tea with the bishop [...] "but he said nothing." [...] The truth was that he substituted words for presence and example. Maybe that {{was just as well}} because theologically he was conservative. His so-called [...] "archiepiscopal palace" [...] - a house made of <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>boarding</b> - became a dormitory every night for homeless youth. You'd have to step over their bodies on the floor if you paid him a late visit. He simply lived for and with the poor. When people would steal from him, as they sometimes did, he'd say, [...] "I hope they needed it more than we did." [...] I saw some people despise him for that kind of attitude. They thought him politically naïve and a bit of an impractical joke. I just saw love, {{and from time to time}} I still feel that love as a mentoring hand, even years after his passing." ...|$|R
50|$|Transite {{originated}} as a {{brand that}} Johns-Manville created in 1929 for {{a line of}} <b>asbestos-cement</b> products, including <b>boards</b> and pipes. In time it became a generic term for other companies' similar asbestos-cement products, and later an even more generic term for a hard, fireproof composite material, fibre cement boards, typically used in wall construction. It {{can also be found}} in insulation, siding, roof gutters, and cement wallboard.|$|R
5000|$|NFPA 255 Standard Method of Test of Surface Burning Characteristics of Building Materials, {{utilizes}} ASTM E84 Standard Test Method for Surface Burning Characteristics of Building Materials. This {{test method}} measures flame growth {{on the underside}} of a horizontal test specimen, using the Steiner tunnel test. The result is derivation of a Flame Spread Index (FSI), which is a non-dimensional number which is placed on a relative scale in which <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>board</b> has a value of 0, and red oak wood has 100. Evaluation of a FSI by this test method does not provide a good understanding of how fire would propagate in full scale, such as in a room, for some materials. In particular, the results for materials that drip, such as thermoplastics, are not indicative of the fire hazard as installed on walls and ceilings because they tend to melt and drip away from the underside of the horizontal ceiling in the test chamber. Because the test method measures how far down the test chamber the fire progressed, this type of [...] "lack of fire progression" [...] provides a misleading FSI. In order to address such restrictions, a new test method was derived, NFPA 286 Standard Methods of Fire Tests for Evaluating Contribution of Wall and Ceiling Interior Finish to Room Fire Growth.|$|E
