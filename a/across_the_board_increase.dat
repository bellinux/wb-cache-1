40|$|This nontechnical paper {{discusses}} {{the adverse effects}} of high marginal tax rates on labor income and on investment income. It explains that the deadweight loss of a tax on labor income depends on the response of taxable income {{and not just the}} change in labor supply. An <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>increase</b> in personal tax rates involves a deadweight loss of 76 cents per dollar of revenue and only collects about two-thirds of the revenue implied by a %u 201 Cstatic%u 201 D calculation. A tax on investment income brings a deadweight loss even if household saving does not respond to taxes and the net rate of return. What matters is the response of future consumption. The tax on investment income is also effectively a tax on labor supply because current work effort produces income that will be spent on future consumption and the tax on investment income reduces the future consumption that results from more work today. An appendix shows for a simple log utility case that the tax on labor income has a smaller deadweight loss than a tax on investment income with the same present value of revenue. There is a further discussion of the various ways in which capital income taxes distort economic activity. ...|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} three years petrol pricing {{arrangements}} in Australia have undergone several major changes. In particular, the 1977 - 78 Budget introduced a new set of crude oil pricing arrangements which were to have wide ranging ramifications over the next decade- for all consumers. These pricing arrangements were amended in the 1978 - 79 Budget to encompass a policy of moving Australia 2 ̆ 7 s oil prices to world market prices immediately. The impact of these petroleum price increases on the rural sector in aggregate is estimated, for example, at approximately 36 million in the 1977 - 78 period and 69 million in the 1978 - 79 period. This represents an average <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>increase</b> of 1. 2 and 1. 6 per cent per annum respectively, in total cash costs per farm. The assessments given in this paper are tentative and assume a number of factors which may well change. It is therefore important to realise the assumptions behind some of these qualitative statements. These are: (i) price elasticity of demand for petroleum products is more inelastic in agriculture than other sectors, (ii) rural sector 2 ̆ 7 s petroleum intensity remains unchanged; (iii) agricultural producers lack the ability to pass on cost increases; (iv) there is no change in the marketing or distribution of close substitutes to petroleum or rapid change in farm technology.

40|$|Current {{estimates}} of regulatory benefits {{are too low}} and possibly far too low. This is because the standard economic approach to measuring costs and benefits, which attempts to estimate people 2 ̆ 7 s willingness to pay for various regulatory benefits, ignores a central point about valuation, thus producing numbers that systematically understate those benefits. Conventional estimates tell us the amount of income an individual, acting in isolation, {{would be willing to}} sacrifice in return for, say, an increase in safety on the job. But while these estimates are based on the implicit assumption that economic well-being depends only on absolute income, considerable evidence suggests that relative income is also an important factor. When an individual buys additional safety in isolation, he experiences not only an absolute decline in the amounts of other goods and services he can buy, but also a decline in his relative living standards. In contrast, when a regulation requires all workers to purchase additional safety, each worker gives up the same amount of other goods, so no worker experiences a decline in relative living standards. If relative living standards matter, an individual will value an <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>increase</b> in safety more highly than an increase in safety that he alone purchases, Where the government currently pegs the value of a statistical life at about 4 million, it ought to employ a value between 4. 7 million and 7 million.

Next, pieces that are surrounded cannot move; therefore, having pieces along the side to start the game is valuable. Such pieces should also be in position to free other pieces on the inside.

40|$|Althrough {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis {{proved to be more}} of a slowdown than a recession in Australia and that the economy improved throughout 2009, this report finds that more people felt their personal circumstances had declined. The impact of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) on financial markets first became apparent in 2007. However it was not until September 2008 that the Reserve Bank of Australia responded with the first in a series of decreases in official interest rates. By December 2008, the GFC was starting to affect individuals and households, causing changes in consumer confidence, employment, and income and expenditure patterns. Key findings include: 1 The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) proved {{to be more of a}} slowdown than a recession in Australia. 2 A high level of concern existed in the economy in early 2009. This was short-lived owing to effective fiscal and monetary policy measures, and by the end of 2009 economic momentum began to lift, recently confirmed by economic growth data. 3 The GFC had a divergent impact on different age groups: 	data shows that 18 - 24 year olds (Gen Y) were hit the hardest with the highest levels of unemployment, increased reliance on government benefits, and salary growth just above inflation over the period December 2008 to December 2009. Despite this they remained the most optimistic and showed no evidence of slowing down their spending; 	the most restrained group of Australians were those aged 24 - 35, possibly reflecting saving to take advantage of the First Home Owner Grant and in the later part of 2009, reflecting the impact of increased interest rates on existing home owners; and  	real income growth for the highest earning groups – those aged 35 - 44 and 45 - 54 – increased by 2. 8 % and 3. 7 % respectively. Those with the highest increase were aged 55 - 64, where salary payments increased by 6. 0 %. 4 Indicative of the success of economic policy, spending <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>increased</b> and spiked following government cash handouts and tax cuts.

40|$|The NHS plan {{announced}} sustained {{increases in}} funding accompanied by wide ranging reform, {{the success of}} which would be measured by targets set <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>board,</b> including <b>increases</b> in numbers of beds, staff, hospitals and equipment. In this article we assess progress towards the target of 7000 extra beds in hospitals and intermediate care to be achieved by 2004. Summary points are as follows. (1) Although the 2003 / 2004 target for availability of general and acute NHS beds in England was achieved, the increase did not offset the overall decrease in all categories of beds. Bed availabil-ity fell by 2083, from 186 290 in 1999 / 2000 to 184 207 in 2003 / 2004, following a fall of 12558 from 1996 / 1997 to 1999 / 2000. (2) Lack of standardized definitions and data collection sys-tems both within the NHS and for the independent sector, compounded by ambiguity over the funding of extra capacity for the NHS, call into question the accuracy of data collected about intermediate care beds. (3) Systems for collecting data about intermediate care should be made subject to the same code of practice as official NHS statistics in order to mon-itor future targets and plan for provision of care. (4) Changes in definitions, lack of detail about criteria used in setting targets and lack of data about private sector care, make it impossible to monitor the overall capacity available to the NHS and assess whether bed availability targets have been met...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we propose}} an {{approach}} to the spatiotemporal localisation (detection) and classification of multiple concurrent actions within temporally untrimmed videos. Our framework is composed of three stages. In stage 1, appearance and motion detection networks are employed to localise and score actions from colour images and optical flow. In stage 2, the appearance network detections are boosted by combining them with the motion detection scores, in proportion to their respective spatial overlap. In stage 3, sequences of detection boxes {{most likely to be}} associated with a single action instance, called action tubes, are constructed by solving two energy maximisation problems via dynamic programming. While in the first pass, action paths spanning the whole video are built by linking detection boxes over time using their class-specific scores and their spatial overlap, in the second pass, temporal trimming is performed by ensuring label consistency for all constituting detection boxes. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on the challenging UCF 101, J-HMDB- 21 and LIRIS-HARL datasets, achieving new state-of-the-art results <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> and significantly <b>increasing</b> detection speed at test time.

40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the Bachelor of Laws DegreeThe main objective {{of this paper is}} to assess the veracity of penal law objectives in child abuse cases in Kenya. The Children's Act under Section 2 looks at child abuse as consisting physical, sexual, psychological and mental injury. The research endeavours to cover the various forms of child abuse covered by various pieces of legislation, which are sexual abuse, child physical abuse and child trafficking and exploitation. The area is of interest due to a significant rise in child abuse incidences in the country over the years. One of the objectives of laws is to bring about social order in its purest form with an end to avoid conflict. As such to maintain this order the characteristic response of Kenyan legislate:·" to these atrocities was to pass laws that gave unlimited judicial discretion in sentencing and also severe deterrent punishments. From collected data over a span of 10 years since the enforcement of key legislations, the trend of child abuse crimes <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> have <b>increased</b> in conviction rates, prosecutions and arrests. The question then is whether the objective of the laws is responsible for this inefficiency. To figure out the whether a nexus exists thejurisdiction of Canada was used as a comparative study. The Canadian criminal system, based on Common law, is similar to that of Kenya. The similarity of judicial systems and similar child protection laws provided a proper specimen to analyse whether a nexus exists. The sentencing objectives in child abuse cases however is based on a mixture of retribution and deterrence tempered by mandatory minimum sentence. <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> it was seen. that the cases of child abuse either diminished or maintained the same number due to effective investigations, implementation of mandatory minimum sentences and less judicial discretion in sentencing. Therefore, the Kenyan experience can be remedied through introduction of mandatory minimums of penalties. This removes discretion of the judiciary and as such aligns the purpose of the laws.
