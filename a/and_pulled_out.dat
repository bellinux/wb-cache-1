5|$|In January 1952, the 24th Infantry Division, which {{suffered}} over 10,000 {{casualties in}} 18 months of fighting, was redesignated as the Far East Theater reserve <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> of Korea. It returned to Japan to rebuild. The 34th Infantry Regiment was reconstituted, and the division returned to full strength {{during the next}} year, having been replaced in Korea by the 40th Infantry Division of the California Army National Guard. In July 1953, the division returned to Korea to restore order in prisoner of war camps. It arrived {{two weeks before the}} end of the war.|$|E
5|$|Indo-European {{parallels}} {{have been}} proposed between myths of Fenrir and the Persian demon Ahriman. The Yashts refer to a story where Taxma Urupi rode Angra Mainyu as a horse for thirty years. An elaboration of this allusion is found only in a late Parsi commentary. The ruler Taxmoruw (Taxma Urupi) managed to lasso Ahriman (Angra Mainyu) and keep him tied up while taking him for a ride three times a day. After thirty years Ahriman outwitted and swallowed Taxmoruw. In a sexual encounter with Ahriman, Jamshid, Taxmoruw's brother, inserted his hand into Ahriman's anus <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> his brother's corpse. His hand withered from contact with the diabolic innards. The suggested parallels with Fenrir myths are the binding of an evil being by a ruler figure and the subsequent swallowing of the ruler figure by the evil being (Odin and Fenrir), trickery involving the thrusting of a hand into a monster's orifice and the affliction of the inserted limb (Týr and Fenrir).|$|E

5|$|The second {{main event}} match had Bearer's Undertaker {{fighting}} DiBiase's Undertaker. After DiBiase's Undertaker {{walked to the}} ring, Bearer appeared by himself while pushing a casket to the ring. He reached inside the casket <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> an urn, which had a light inside it when Bearer removed its lid. Bearer's Undertaker came to the ring and confronted DiBiase's Undertaker. Both wrestlers were wearing identical costumes, but Bearer's Undertaker wore purple while DiBiase's wore grey. Bearer's Undertaker kicked his opponent out of the ring, where DiBiase's Undertaker tried to attack Bearer. DiBiase's Undertaker attempted to perform an arm twist ropewalk chop, but Bearer's Undertaker stopped him and performed the move. DiBiase's Undertaker then performed a chokeslam and a Tombstone piledriver. As he tried for another Tombstone piledriver, Bearer's Undertaker reversed it and performed the move. Bearer's Undertaker then performed two more Tombstone piledrivers before getting the pinfall victory. A group of people dressed as druids came to ringside, put DiBiase's Undertaker in the casket, and took the casket away.|$|E
5|$|By mid 1918, the new {{commander}} of the Austrian fleet, Konteradmiral Miklós Horthy decided to conduct another attack on the Otranto Barrage, similar to the Otranto Raid from December 1916, to allow more German and Austro-Hungarian U-boats to safely get through the heavily defended strait of Otranto. During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola with Viribus Unitis and Prinz Eugen. Tegetthoff and her sister ship , along with one destroyer and six torpedo boats departed Pola on 9 June. At about 3:15 {{on the morning of}} 10 June, two Italian MAS boats, MAS 15 and MAS 21, spotted the Austrian fleet steaming south. The MAS platoon was commanded by Capitano di fregata Luigi Rizzo while the individual boats were commanded by Capo timoniere Armando Gori and Guardiamarina di complemento Giuseppe Aonzo respectively. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage each of the dreadnoughts. MAS 21 attacked Tegetthoff, but her torpedoes missed the battleship. Despite missing Tegetthoff, the other boat, MAS 15, managed to hit Tegetthoffs sister ship Szent István with her torpedoes at about 3:25am. Both boats were then chased away from the scene by Austrian escort vessels. Immediately following the attack, Tegetthoff thought that the torpedoes were fired by submarines instead of MAS boats <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> of the formation of battleships and destroyers and began to zigzag to throw off any more possible submarine attacks. She continually fired on suspected submarine periscopes until she rejoined Szent István at 4:45.|$|E
5|$|Lhermitte {{approached}} the anchored ships at 18:00, flying false Danish colours, and anchored nearby. A ship's boat from Camel {{approached the}} new arrival, rapidly realising that Preneuse was a hostile frigate {{and returning to}} their ship. Lieutenant William Fothergill, the most senior officer with the convoy, fired warning shots close to the frigate, which Lhermitte ignored. Both British ships then prepared for action. At 20:30, Preneuse began to approach Rattlesnake and Fothergill opened fire immediately, joined by Camel. Lhermitte returned fire, focusing its broadside on Camel. By midnight Camel had taken several shot in the hull causing widespread flooding, and the crew ceased firing to man the pumps. Lhermitte apparently believed that Camel had abandoned the fight and he switched fire towards Rattlesnake, the engagement continuing until 03:30 at which point Lhermitte slipped his anchor <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> of range. Remaining in the bay until 10:00 before standing out to sea. British losses were two killed and twelve wounded, both Camel and Rattlesnake badly damaged. It was later reported in French sources that Lhermitte believed the schooner Surprise to be a well armed naval brig, prompting his withdrawal. Preneuses loss in the action was around 40 killed and wounded, and the frigate {{was reported to be}} badly damaged; messages to this effect were hastily sent to the commander at the Cape, Captain George Losack who sent the 50-gun HMS Jupiter in pursuit.|$|E

By 2003, Southwest and Continental Express {{were the only two}} major commercial airlines operating out of Love Field. However, due to Southwest's success and the possibility of other airlines returning in the future, the airport has completed an expansion of its parking facilities and is redeveloping one of its terminals.|$|E

In the final Matthews felt she got a bad start and was last at the 50metre mark.

25|$|South Africa, itself under {{international}} pressure {{as a white}} minority government, pursued a policy of détente with the black African states at the time. These states wanted South Africa to pressure Ian Smith to accept a faster transition to majority rule in Rhodesia, in return for pledges of non-interference in South Africa's internal affairs. Prime Minister John Vorster, believing majority rule in Rhodesia would lead to international acceptance for South Africa, used a number of tactics to pressure Smith. The South African government held up shipments of fuel and ammunition <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> friendly South African forces from Rhodesia. The combined loss of Mozambique {{and the loss of}} support from South Africa dealt critical blows to the Rhodesian government.|$|E

25|$|Ayres's {{right flank}} brigade under Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) James Gwyn had moved {{well ahead of}} Crawford's {{division}} and began to waver as the troops realized they might be exposed to a flank attack. On his horse, Sheridan called for his battle flag. He rode among the soldiers shouting encouragement, threats, profanities and orders to close ranks. His color sergeant was killed. Another staff officer was wounded {{and at least two}} other staff officers' horses were killed. Sheridan and Ayres and his officers managed to quickly get the troops under control and order them forward again. This time some of Ransom's defenders broke for the rear. McGregor's gunners limbered up their four artillery pieces <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> just as Ayres's men came over the earthworks.

Roddick then began his clay-court season at the Mutua Madrid Open, but he was upset {{in the first round}} by Italian qualifier Flavio Cipolla in three sets. Roddick continued to warm up for the 2011 French Open in Italy, playing the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, but lost in the first round for the second straight tournament to Gilles Simon. He teamed with Mardy Fish to play doubles in Rome, and they went to the final before Roddick had to withdraw because of a shoulder injury. Roddick also withdrew from the Nice Open in France <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> of the 2011 French Open, after failing to recover.|$|E
25|$|Though the duo never stated so outright, their {{additional}} {{motivation in}} {{getting involved with}} KK Partizan again was perceived to be gaining the upper hand on the club's eventual privatisation process once the new Law on Sports gets passed in the Serbian parliament. Since the exact ownership structure of a publicly owned KK Partizan wasn't and still isn't really clear, potential investors decided to stay away, {{at least until the}} law appears. Divac and Danilović appeared pretty much out of nowhere in this regard but enjoyed plenty of fan and public support because most preferred to see their beloved club owned and operated by its former stars rather than a faceless corporation or a group of politicians, managers or businessmen close to the ruling coalition. However, after a few years the duo ran out of patience <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> of the venture in late 2004 because it became too much of a financial burden with no end-goal in sight. While he stopped performing any official functions at the club, Divac continues to be involved with it in a lesser capacity.|$|E
