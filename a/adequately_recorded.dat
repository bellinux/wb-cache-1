50|$|By far, the {{dominant}} vegetation sub-type is chaparral. Chaparral {{is composed of}} drought- and fire-tolerant evergreen shrubs that range in height from four to ten feet. Unless recently subjected to fire, or some other type of disturbance, this plant community is generally too dense to penetrate. Another unique shrub community to Southern California is sage scrub, which varies between coastal and inland types. Sage scrub vegetation contains fewer stout, woody shrubs, and more openings with fine, delicate plants. The expansive valley floors between the mountain ranges were plowed and farmed long ago. They are now entirely developed. The precise former native plant cover of the San Fernando, Simi and Santa Clarita Valleys was never <b>adequately</b> <b>recorded.</b> It is suspected that native perennial bunch grasses were dominant elements. Throughout the zone, over ninety-five percent of the native grasslands have been displaced by foreign invasive plants. The most common riparian (stream-related) woodland species are various willows, coast live oak, California sycamore, and Fremont's cottonwood. Less common species that are relics of the last Ice Age include white alder, bigleaf maple, and black cottonwood. On slopes, and in valleys where rainfall concentrates, groves of evergreen coast live oaks are common throughout Benedict Canyon. These evergreen oaks provide food and shelter for numerous species of wildlife. Deeper soiled areas in the Santa Susana Mountains, the Simi Hills and the Santa Monica Mountains support the deciduous valley oak. A widely dispersed tree in the Santa Monica Mountains, {{and to a lesser}} extent in other ranges, is the California black walnut.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{accessibility}} of adequate instrumentation to conduct fundamental researches {{for the development}} of new diagnostic tools and methods in electrophysiology is essential. As such, many researchers develop proprietary instrumentation systems based on commercially available data acquisition boards. These boards are typically not designed for recording electrophysiological signals and as such, they may introduce significant error artifacts such as signal distortions, which in turn may lead to false interpretations. In this paper, we describe a data acquisition board that has the specifications required to <b>adequately</b> <b>record</b> many electrophysiological signals under difficult conditions, as it is often the case in a fundamental research environment. Furthermore, unlike other comparable in-house systems, it enables custom hardware functions to be implemented to support specific requirements encountered in a research environment. The card can also be installed directly in any modern personal computers offering an inexpensive, open, powerful, and very flexible system allowing researchers to easily take advantage of both commercial hardware and software to tailor the final system configuration for their particular needs...|$|R

While death {{is likely to}} be <b>adequately</b> <b>recorded,</b> return migration is problematic for register data (and implicitly for studies based on them). Labour contracts, individual preferences, increased purchasing power, acquired human capital, risk diversification and relative deprivation are seen as important factors causing return migration. Earlier studies for Sweden have shown that the rate of return can vary widely between the various immigrant groups. These studies also argue that the rate of return depends heavily on the motivation to migrate. Labour migrants have generally a much higher rate of return than refugees (Klinthäll, 2007; Lundh & Ohlsson, 1999). Studies based on register data have several statistical techniques to control for outmigration and possible biases connected to this and therefore increase their reliability.|$|E

40|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century Walter Benjamin called for more than textual ways of writing to more <b>adequately</b> <b>record</b> the passing of the present into the past. Jared Gardner (2006) contends that the form Benjamin sought was the 'comic book' or 'graphic novel', in which the present becomes its own 'archive'—its past always in the process of becoming. Indeed, graphic {{narrative}} might be characterised by a refusal to choose, such that it operates in the interstices between present and past, word and image, presence and absence, writer and reader. Influentially, Scott McCloud (1993) has argued that graphic narrative spatialises time through the rhythms of presence and absence in its frames and gutters. He argues that comics enlist their readers as active collaborators in the meaning-making process of 'closure' as they fill in the gaps between frames. Yet, the alliance between writers and readers is always uneasy. In rendering time as space, graphic narrative serves to fracture both. In the liminality of the gutters tensions are never neutralised, but put to creative use; 'we' are moved to see, feel or think differently through an active process of imaginative production (Whitlock, 2006). Setting aside any controversy over the literary merits of graphic narrative, this paper explores affect and performativity in popular, 'shonen' (boys) manga, specifically Tite Kubo's 'Bleach' (2001 -present), Hiromu Arakawa's 'Fullmetal Alchemist' (2001 -present), Masashi Kishimoto's 'Naruto' (1999 -present) and Kazuki Takahashi's 'Yu-Gi-Oh' (1996 – 2004). ...|$|R

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Guidelines are playing an increasingly important role in evidence-based practice. After publication of the Quebec Task Force in Canada in 1987 and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research guidelines in the United States in 1994, guidelines for acute low back pain were developed in many other countries. However, {{little is known about the}} methodologic quality of these guidelines. METHODS: Guidelines were selected by electronically searching MEDLINE and the Internet and through personal communication with experts in the field of low back pain research in primary care. The methodologic quality of the guidelines was assessed by two authors independently using the AGREE instrument. RESULTS: A total of 17 guidelines were included. Overall, the quality of reporting of guidelines was disappointing. Most guidelines clearly described the aim of the guideline and its target population, and most guideline development committees were multiprofessional. However, many other methodologic flaws were identified. More than half of the guidelines did not take patients' preferences into account, did not perform a pilot test among target users, did not clearly describe the methods of study identification and selection, did not include an external review, did not provide a procedure for updating, were not supported with tools for application, did not consider potential organizational barriers and cost implications, did not provide criteria for monitoring and audit, did not include recommendations for implementation strategies, and did not <b>adequately</b> <b>record</b> editorial independence and conflict of interest of the members. The diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations of the guidelines were largely similar. CONCLUSIONS: The quality and transparency of the development process and the consistency in the reporting of primary care guidelines for low back pain need to be improved...|$|R
5000|$|Fidelity - Contrary to {{conventional}} wisdom, neither Vitaphone's ability {{to fill a}} theater with an adequate volume of sound nor its success in maintaining synchronization was unprecedented. Léon Gaumont's sound-on-disc films, which were being shown twenty years earlier, were successfully synchronized {{by the use of}} electrically interlinked multi-pole synchronous motors, and a pneumatic amplification system more than sufficed to fill Gaumont's 3,400-seat flagship theater in Paris with the recorded sound. That sound, however, had to be recorded by the same insensitive non-electronic method introduced by Thomas Edison in 1877, or alternatively by a very crude microphone-based variant which had logistical advantages but did not offer improved fidelity. The resulting sound, however greatly amplified it might be, was tinny and unclear and speech was difficult to understand. The footsteps and other incidental sounds that audiences instinctively expected to hear were missing. It did not sound [...] "natural". The Vitaphone system derived from extensive work on electronically recording and reproducing sound that had been carried out at Western Electric {{during the first half of}} the 1920s. Western Electric's engineers had developed a highly sensitive full-frequency-range condenser microphone, capable of capturing a whisper from several feet away, along with the electronic and mechanical equipment necessary to <b>adequately</b> <b>record</b> the audio signal it produced. As a result, the quality of Vitaphone sound in the theater came as a revelation to the audience at its public debut in 1926. It easily and dramatically surpassed anything previously achieved. It even surpassed the sound quality of Western Electric's own sound-on-film system, developed concurrently with the sound-on-disc system but still in the laboratory at that time, because at first the discs yielded better fidelity than an optical sound track.|$|R

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of bedtime nasal instillation of chondroitin sulfate solution was {{tested in a}} double-masked, crossover, placebo-controlled trial of seven nonapneic subjects who snored. Subjects were assessed for reduction in snoring using conventional polysomnographic studies. The analysis of snoring was performed using the recordings obtained by a multidirectional microphone placed above the subject's head. Snoring was defined as an inspiratory, raspy, snort-like sound. The percentage of total sleep time (TST) spent snoring and the equal energy level related to sleep were calculated for each nocturnal sleep recording. Results of the sleep studies were similar with placebo and chondroitin sulfate. However, the mean percentage of TST spent snoring decreased from 46. 5 % with placebo to 31. 3 % with chondroitin sulfate, with important interindividual differences.

40|$|As {{industrial}} activities {{continue to grow}} on the Brazilian coast, underwater sound measurements are becoming of great scientific importance as they are essential to evaluate {{the impact of these}} activities on local ecosystems. In this context, the use of commercial underwater recorders is not always the most feasible alternative, due to their high cost and lack of flexibility.

With the aim of providing a solution; a well succeeded model of a highly flexible, low-cost alternative to commercial recorders was built based on a Raspberry Pi single board computer. A properly working prototype was assembled and it demonstrated adequate performance levels in all tested situations. The prototype was equipped with a power management module which was thoroughly evaluated. It is estimated that it will allow for great battery savings on long-term scheduled recordings. The underwater recording device was successfully deployed at selected locations along the Brazilian coast, where it <b>adequately</b> <b>recorded</b> animal and manmade acoustic events, among others.

This comprehensive MORB data set, which includes both “normal-type ” (N-MORB, defined by (La/Sm) Nb 1. 00) and “enriched-type ” samples (E-MORB, (La/Sm) N≥ 1. 00), defines a global MORB composition that is more enriched in incompatible elements than previous models. A statistical evaluation of the true constancy of “canonical ” trace element ratios using this data set reveals that during MORB genesis Ti/Eu, Y/Ho and Ce/Pb remain constant at the 95 % confidence-level; thus, the ratios recorded in MORB (Ti/Eu= 7060 ± 1270, 2 σ; Y/Ho= 28. 4 ± 3. 6, 2 σ; Ce/Pb= 22. 2 ± 9. 7, 2 σ) may reflect the composition of the DMM, presuming the degree of source heterogeneity, component mixing and conditions of melting/crystallization of the DMM are <b>adequately</b> <b>recorded</b> by global MORB.

40|$|Abstract Background Over {{the past}} ten years there has been an {{increasing}} focus on the need for improving the experience of end of life care. A number of policy initiatives have been introduced to develop approaches to discussing and documenting individual preferences for end of life care, in particular preferred place to die. Methods The aim was to investigate practice in relation to discussing and documenting end of life care and preferred place to die in the last 4 weeks of life with patients and their families. The study utilised an audit of 65 case notes, alongside four group interviews with a mix of health care professionals involved in palliative care provision. Results While there was evidence that discussions relating to end of life care and preferred place to die had taken place in around half of the audited case notes, there appeared to be a lack of a systematic approach to the recording of discussions with patients or carers about these kind of issues. Health care staff subsequently highlighted that initiating discussions about end of life care and preferences in relation to place of death was challenging and that the recording and tracking of such preferences was problematic. Conclusions Further work is required to establish how information may be <b>adequately</b> <b>recorded,</b> revised and transferred across services to ensure that patients' preferences in relation to end of life care and place of death are, as far as possible, achieved. </p...|$|E

As well as pain from other long term conditions, stroke {{patients can}} experience central post-stroke pain, headaches, and musculoskeletal issues such as hypertonia, contractures, spasticity, and subluxations. These stroke patients can also have communication difficulties {{in the form of}} expressive dysphasia and/or global aphasia. Communication difficulties can result in these patients not expressing their pain and therefore not having it assessed, leading to inadequate pain relief that could impact their rehabilitation and recovery.
