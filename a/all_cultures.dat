5|$|The {{dominance}} of Latin among the literate elite may obscure {{the continuity of}} spoken languages, since <b>all</b> <b>cultures</b> within the Roman Empire were predominantly oral. In the West, Latin, referred to in its spoken form as Vulgar Latin, gradually replaced Celtic and Italic languages that were related to it by a shared Indo-European origin. Commonalities in syntax and vocabulary facilitated the adoption of Latin.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominance}} of Latin and Greek among the literate elite may obscure {{the continuity of}} spoken languages, since <b>all</b> <b>cultures</b> within the Roman Empire were predominantly oral. In areas where Syriac, Coptic, Hebrew and Aramaic were spoken, they coexisted with Greek.|$|E
5|$|Flanders had {{a strict}} Congregationalist {{religious}} beginning, which evolved with his experience into {{a belief in}} “moral law.” He felt that “recognition of moral law {{is as much a}} necessary requirement of social achievement as physical law is of material advancement.” In Flanders’s view, moral law required honesty, compassion, responsibility, cooperation, humility, and wisdom—values that <b>all</b> <b>cultures</b> hold in common. For him it was an absolute standard. He spoke of a “Presence” or “daimon” that “renewed his courage” and “indicated direction” in everything he did.|$|E

5000|$|... 'University culture' can {{be defined}} as the culture in a university, the culture that {{students}} in the university create, contribute and are a part of, or <b>all</b> <b>culture</b> which is related to university.

5|$|Speaking is {{the default}} {{modality}} for language in <b>all</b> <b>cultures.</b> The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other {{components of the}} vocal apparatus, the ability to acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus required for acquiring and producing language. The study of the genetic bases for human language is at an early stage: the only gene that has definitely been implicated in language production is FOXP2, which may cause a kind of congenital language disorder if affected by mutations.|$|E
5|$|The Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In some areas, pasties are a {{significant}} tourist attraction, including an annual Pasty Fest in Calumet, Michigan in late June. Pasties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan have a particularly unusual history. Many ethnic groups adopted the pasty {{for use in the}} Copper Country copper mines; the Finnish immigrants to the region mistook it for the traditional piiraat and kuuko pastries. The pasty has become strongly associated with <b>all</b> <b>cultures</b> in this area, and in the similar Iron Range in northern Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|Epic narratives, poems, sagas and allegories from <b>all</b> <b>cultures</b> tell such {{gripping}} tales {{that they}} have inspired countless other stories in all forms of entertainment. Examples include the Hindu Ramayana and Mahabharata; Homer's Odyssey and Iliad; the first Arabic novel Hayy ibn Yaqdhan; the Persian epic Shahnameh; the Sagas of Icelanders and the celebrated Tale of the Genji. Collections of stories, such as Grimms' Fairy Tales or those by Hans Christian Andersen, have been similarly influential. Originally published in the early 19th century, this collection of folk stories significantly influence modern popular culture, which subsequently used its themes, images, symbols, and structural elements to create new entertainment forms.|$|E

50|$|The {{idea behind}} Year Zero is that <b>all</b> <b>culture</b> and traditions within a society must be {{completely}} destroyed or discarded {{and a new}} revolutionary culture must replace it, starting from scratch.

5000|$|For Hegel, <b>all</b> <b>culture</b> is {{a matter}} of [...] "absolute spirit" [...] coming to be {{manifest}} to itself, stage by stage, changing to a perfection that only philosophy can approach. Art is the first stage in which the absolute spirit is manifest immediately to sense-perception, and is thus an objective rather than subjective revelation of beauty.|$|R
5|$|In {{cultures}} {{that did not}} recognize a smallpox deity, there was often nonetheless a belief in smallpox demons, who were accordingly blamed for the disease. Such beliefs were prominent in Japan, Europe, Africa, {{and other parts of}} the world. Nearly <b>all</b> <b>cultures</b> who believed in the demon also believed that it was afraid of the color red. This led to the invention of so-called red treatment, where victims and their rooms would be decorated in red. The practice spread to Europe in the 12th century and was practiced by (among others) Charles V of France and Elizabeth I of England. Afforded scientific credibility through the studies by Finsen showing that red light reduced scarring, this belief persisted even until the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Entertainment {{is a form}} of {{activity}} that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but {{is more likely to be}} one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in <b>all</b> <b>cultures,</b> were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.|$|E
25|$|Attitudes {{and laws}} {{regarding}} adoption vary greatly. Whereas <b>all</b> <b>cultures</b> make arrangements whereby children whose birth parents are unavailable to rear {{them can be}} brought up by others, not <b>all</b> <b>cultures</b> have the concept of adoption, that is treating unrelated children as equivalent to biological children of the adoptive parents. Under Islamic Law, for example, adopted children must keep their original surname {{to be identified with}} blood relations, and, traditionally, women wear a hijab in the presence of males in their adoptive households. In Egypt, these cultural distinctions have led to making adoption illegal.|$|E
