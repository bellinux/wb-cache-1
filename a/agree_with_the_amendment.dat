If a Bill passed by one House is amended by the other House, it is sent back to the originating House for approval. If the originating House does not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>amendments,</b> it shall be that the two houses have disagreed. The other House may keep a money bill for 14 days and an ordinary Bill for three months without passing (or rejecting) it. If it fails to return the Bill within the fixed time, the Bill is deemed to be passed by both the houses and is sent for the approval of the President.|$|R

30|$|In 1898, Kuo {{was born}} to a {{merchant}} family in Tongyu Village, Chaoyang County, Guangdong Province, China. He entered Fudan University in 1916 and left two years later to pursue advanced studies in the United States, where he enrolled in the University of California at Berkeley. After some vacillation, he settled on psychology as his major. In 1918, he met his supervisor, Edward Chace Tolman, a flagman in neo-behaviorism, who began at the University of California the same year. During the years of 1921 and 1922, he worked as an assistant at Berkeley, completed his studies and met the requirements for a Doctor of Philosophy in 1923. However, Kuo did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>amendments</b> put forward by school authorities on his doctoral thesis and instead persisted in his academic viewpoints. He thus gave up the chance to earn his Ph.D. and returned to China before his oral thesis defense (Kuo, 1940). He would not earn a doctoral degree until 1936.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the seventh}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Joseph left hastily for his chamber and wept, washed his face, returned, {{and called for}} the {{servants}} to serve the meal. Joseph sat by himself, the brothers sat by themselves, and the Egyptians sat by themselves, {{because it was an}} abomination to the Egyptians to eat <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Hebrews. The brothers marveled that the servants had seated them according to their age. And Benjamin's portion was five times so much as any of his brothers'. Joseph directed the steward to fill <b>the</b> men's sacks <b>with</b> as much food as they could carry, put every man's money in his sack, and put Joseph's silver goblet in the youngest one's sack. At dawn, the brothers were sent away, but when they had not yet gone far from the city, Joseph directed his steward to overtake them and ask them why they had rewarded evil for good and taken <b>the</b> goblet <b>with</b> which Joseph drank and divined. They asked the steward why he accused them, as they had brought back the money that they had found in their sacks, and they volunteered that <b>the</b> one <b>with</b> whom <b>the</b> goblet was found would die, and the brothers would become bondmen. <b>The</b> steward <b>agreed,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>amendment</b> that <b>the</b> one <b>with</b> whom it was found would be a bondman and the others would go free. Hastily, every man opened his sack, starting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> eldest, and they found the goblet in Benjamin's sack. They rent their clothes, loaded their donkeys, and returned to the city.|$|R
5|$|A popular Congressman {{and former}} Army officer, Hayes was {{considered}} by Ohio Republicans {{to be an}} excellent standard-bearer for the 1867 election campaign. Hayes's political views were more moderate than the Republican party's platform, although he <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> proposed <b>amendment</b> to <b>the</b> Ohio state constitution that would guarantee suffrage to black male Ohioans. Hayes's opponent, Allen G. Thurman, made <b>the</b> proposed <b>amendment</b> <b>the</b> centerpiece of the campaign and opposed black suffrage. Both men campaigned vigorously, making speeches across the state, mostly focusing on the suffrage question. The election was mostly a disappointment to Republicans, as <b>the</b> <b>amendment</b> failed to pass and Democrats gained {{a majority in the}} state legislature. Hayes thought at first that he, too, had lost, but the final tally showed that he had won the election by 2,983 votes of 484,603 votes cast.|$|R

50|$|Concurring in the judgment, Justice Alito largely <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Court's result {{but took}} issue <b>with</b> <b>the</b> breadth of its holding.
