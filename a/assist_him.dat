5|$|During the 1780s, Johnson {{achieved}} success: he {{did well}} financially and his firm published more books with other firms. Although Johnson had begun {{his career as a}} relatively cautious publisher of religious and scientific tracts, he was now able to take more risks and he encouraged friends to recommend works to him, creating a network of informal reviewers. Yet Johnson's business was never large; he usually had only one assistant and never took on an apprentice. Only {{in the last years of}} his life did two relatives <b>assist</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

5|$|Nabis {{also made}} his own preparations.

The Romans and their allies then advanced upon Sellasia not far north of Sparta. The Romans were defeated in a small battle and they retreated.

5|$|Since Andros' {{commission}} included Connecticut, {{he asked}} Connecticut Governor Robert Treat to surrender the colonial charter {{not long after}} his arrival in Boston. Unlike Rhode Island, whose officials readily acceded to the dominion, Connecticut officials formally acknowledged Andros' authority, but did little to <b>assist</b> <b>him.</b> They continued to run their government according to the charter, holding quarterly meetings of the legislature and electing colony-wide officials, while Treat and Andros negotiated over the surrender of the charter.|$|E

5|$|Allen {{left the}} Black Order because the {{previous}} story arc {{had too many}} characters and required too much effort. Hoshino was pleased with her portrayal of Allen's farewell to comrade Lenalee Lee because it indicated that the character had matured. She noted that Allen had grown taller; early in the series, he and Lenalee were the same height. Hoshino said that although Allen's departure fit the series' tragic theme, he would always have comrades. Allen and Kanda part on good terms in the previous story arc despite their frequent arguments, and Hoshino said that Kanda would <b>assist</b> <b>him</b> in the next storyline.|$|E

5|$|At its founding, music {{submissions}} to {{the site}} were evaluated for inclusion solely by Lloyd, who required that all arrangements both meet his quality bar and also feature an original interpretation of the music, rather than minimally changing the original track. In early 2002, however, to better accommodate the volume of music submissions and improve selection consistency, Lloyd instituted a panel of judges, composed of accomplished artists and contributors to the community, to <b>assist</b> <b>him</b> in music selection, though he still provided an initial evaluation of all submissions for meeting a minimum quality bar. Judge Larry Oji (a.k.a. Liontamer) became head submissions evaluator for the organization in June 2006, taking over the majority of Lloyd's evaluation work and freeing him {{to focus on the}} site and company itself.|$|E
5|$|During the Mexican War of Independence from 18101821, Texas {{experienced}} much turmoil. Governor Manuel María de Salcedo {{was overthrown}} by rebels in 1810, but persuaded his jailer to release him and <b>assist</b> <b>him</b> in organizing a counter-coup. Three years later, the Republican Army of the North, consisting primarily of Indians and Americans, again overthrew the Texas government and executed Salcedo. The Spanish response was brutal, and by 1820 fewer than 2000 Hispanic citizens remained in Texas. Spain {{was forced to}} relinquish its control of New Spain in 1821, with Texas becoming a province of the newly formed nation of Mexico, leading to the period in Texas history known as Mexican Texas.|$|E
5|$|In 1851, the Temenggong {{delegated}} Abu Bakar, then an eighteen-year-old youth, to <b>assist</b> <b>him</b> in negotiation efforts against Sultan Ali, who {{was making}} frivolous attempts to claim sovereignty rights over Johor.

During this period, several British officers praised of Abu Bakar's excellent diplomatic skills, as mentioned in William Napier's diaries, who was the senior law agent of Singapore. Napier had accompanied Abu Bakar to fetch Tengku Teh, {{the mother of the}} deposed Sultan of Lingga, Mahmud Muzaffar Shah to Johor shortly after her son began to exert sovereignty claims over Pahang.|$|E

Gadd - the Poltergust 3000, a specially modified, high powered vacuum cleaner; and the Game Boy Horror, a parody of Nintendo's Game Boy Color.|$|E

On 5 July, {{a day after the}} end of the UEFA Euro 2004, Benfica announced Trapattoni as manager. The 65-year-old Italian started his managerial career in 1974 and came to recognition at Juventus, where he became one of Italy's greatest managers, the only one to have won all UEFA club competitions and the Intercontinental Cup. To <b>assist</b> <b>him,</b> he brought fitness coach Fausto Rossi and goalkeeping coach Adriano Barbin, while Álvaro Magalhães remained as assistant manager.|$|E
5|$|Monica Grey played Paula Quatermass; she {{was chosen}} by BBC {{management}} rather than the production team, as she was {{the wife of the}} BBC's head of radio drama, Val Gielgud. As Hugh Griffith also had problems with some of his technical dialogue, Grey learned his lines as well as her own, in case she needed to step in and <b>assist</b> <b>him</b> during the live performance. Dillon was played by John Stone; Stone too had a long career as a supporting actor in a range of British television series, and in 1956 had a small role in the film X the Unknown, which Hammer Film Productions had intended as a sequel to their version of The Quatermass Experiment, until Kneale denied them the rights to use the character.|$|E
