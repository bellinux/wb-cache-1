5|$|The Giants hired All-Pro {{offensive}} tackle Steve Owen {{to be their}} new player-head coach prior to the 1931 season. He coached the team for the next 23 years, including two NFL championships, and {{was inducted into the}} Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1966. Owen never had a contract with the Mara family; he coached his entire tenure on <b>a</b> <b>handshake</b> basis.|$|E
5|$|Prost won his fourth, and final, title, {{but in a}} {{year where}} he was {{regularly}} challenged by teammate Hill, and Ayrton Senna. Shortly before the Portuguese Grand Prix in October 1993, Prost announced he would not defend his world title, as the clause in the Frenchman's contract did not extend to 1994 and Senna {{would be able to}} join Williams for the upcoming season, and instead opted to retire as the driver with the record for most grand prix victories — a record which stood for almost a decade. On the podium in Adelaide in 1993, Prost's last race, he and Senna embraced. Prost was surprised by the gesture, as Senna had declined <b>a</b> <b>handshake</b> the race before. Prost's performances earned him an OBE.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two basic}} forms of data packet, DATA0 and DATA1. A data packet must always be preceded by an address token, and is usually {{followed}} by <b>a</b> <b>handshake</b> token from the receiver back to the transmitter. The two packet types provide the 1-bit sequence number required by stop-and-wait ARQ. If a USB host does not receive a response (such as an ACK) for data it has transmitted, it does not know if the data was received or not; the data might have been lost in transit or {{it might have been}} received but the handshake response was lost.|$|E

5|$|By December 1989, Stone began {{approaching}} studios to {{back his}} film. While in pre-production on The Doors, {{he met with}} three executives at Warner Bros. who wanted {{him to make a}} film about Howard Hughes. However, Warren Beatty owned the rights and so Stone pitched JFK. Studio president and Chief Operating Officer Terry Semel liked the idea. He had a reputation for making political and controversial films, including All the President's Men, The Parallax View and The Killing Fields. Stone made <b>a</b> <b>handshake</b> deal with Warner Bros. whereby the studio would get all the rights to the film and put up $20 million for the budget. The director did this so that the screenplay would not be widely read and bid on, and he also knew that the material was potentially dangerous and wanted only one studio to finance it. Finally, Stone liked Semel's track record of producing political films.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Round held First Division club Cardiff City in snowy {{conditions}} at Ninian Park. Vale won 2–0, and their victory was {{aided by the}} fact that Cardiff goalkeeper Ron Howells had to leave the pitch after 20 minutes after being knocked out following a collision with defender Derrick Sullivan, leaving his ten-man team to play 70 minutes with defender Alf Sherwood in goal. Vale attacked through the wings to get in numerous crosses to the box, from which Ken Griffiths and Albert Leake scored their goals. Centre-half Tommy Cheadle restricted centre-forward Trevor Ford to a quiet game, and at full-time the pair were full of bruises but still left the pitch with <b>a</b> <b>handshake</b> and a smile. Cardiff placed a £25,000 transfer bid for winger Colin Askey, and after their offer was rejected Cardiff stated they were prepared to pay more than £25,000, but Port Vale refused any negotiations. Other top clubs also made inquiries, but were all turned away.|$|E
5|$|The other {{featured}} preliminary {{match was}} Kurt Angle versus The Big Show in a singles match. The buildup to the match began on September 9, 2004 during {{an episode of}} SmackDown!, where a Lumberjack match (a standard match where non-participating wrestlers prevent contestants from fleeing the ring) was scheduled between Kurt Angle and Eddie Guerrero. The match ended in a no contest when The Big Show marked his return to SmackDown! by interfering in the match, chokeslamming both Angle and Guerrero in the process. The following week, Big Show was given two contracts to choose from; one contract to face Guerrero and one contract to face Angle. Big Show signed the contract with Guerrero's name on it. After signing it, Angle and his associate Luther Reigns, threw Guerrero {{out of the ring}} and offered Big Show <b>a</b> <b>handshake.</b> Big Show, however, tore up Guerrero's contract and signed the one with Angle's name on it to face him at No Mercy.|$|E

5|$|Another one of Bowerman's pupils, Phil Knight, {{partnered with}} Bowerman and {{revolutionized}} the sport with {{the formation of}} the shoe company giant, Nike. Knight graduated from the University of Oregon in 1959 and went on to Stanford University for graduate school. There, he developed the idea to import Japanese running shoes to the American market. After earning his MBA from Stanford, he returned to the University of Oregon where he and Bowerman struck <b>a</b> <b>handshake</b> deal in 1964, each with a $500 investment into a company called Blue Ribbon Sports to import Japanese running shoes. In the late 1960s, Bowerman's pursuit of lighter shoes for his athletes led him to develop a sole by pouring rubber into his wife's waffle iron, inventing the modern running shoe. After Knight decided to rename the company Nike and develop its own shoes, Bowerman's invention became the prototype for the company. The shoe made its debut in the 1972 Olympic Trials at Hayward Field with Steve Prefontaine as one of the early endorsers. Although Bowerman retired from coaching in 1972, he remained on Nike's board until 1999. In that time, Nike exploded into a multibillion-dollar company.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, on September 19, 1827, Bowie and Wright {{attended a}} duel on a sandbar outside of Natchez, Mississippi. Bowie supported duellist Samuel Levi Wells III, while Wright supported Wells's opponent, Dr. Thomas Harris Maddox. The duellists each fired two shots and, as neither {{man had been}} injured, resolved their duel with <b>a</b> <b>handshake.</b> Other members of the groups, who had various reasons for disliking each other, began fighting. Bowie {{was shot in the}} hip; after regaining his feet he drew a knife, described as a butcher knife, and charged his attacker, who hit Bowie over the head with his empty pistol, breaking the pistol and knocking Bowie to the ground. Wright shot at and missed the prone Bowie, who returned fire and possibly hit Wright. Wright then drew his sword cane and impaled Bowie. When Wright attempted to retrieve his blade by placing his foot on Bowie's chest and tugging, Bowie pulled him down and disemboweled Wright with his large knife. Wright died instantly, and Bowie, with Wright's sword still protruding from his chest, was shot again and stabbed by another member of the group. The doctors who had been present for the duel removed the bullets and patched Bowie's other wounds.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{problems}} with viewing attachment as a trait (stable characteristic of an individual) {{rather than as}} a type of behaviour with organising functions and outcomes, led some authors to the conclusion that attachment behaviours were best understood in terms of their functions in the child's life. This way of thinking saw the secure base concept as central to attachment theory's logic, coherence, and status as an organizational construct. Following this argument, the assumption that attachment is expressed identically in all humans cross-culturally was examined. The research showed that though there were cultural differences, the three basic patterns, secure, avoidant and ambivalent, can be found in every culture in which studies have been undertaken, even where communal sleeping arrangements are the norm.Selection of the secure pattern is found in the majority of children across cultures studied. This follows logically from the fact that attachment theory provides for infants to adapt to changes in the environment, selecting optimal behavioural strategies. How attachment is expressed shows cultural variations which need to be ascertained before studies can be undertaken; for example Gusii infants are greeted with <b>a</b> <b>handshake</b> rather than a hug. Securely attached Gusii infants anticipate and seek this contact. There are also differences in the distribution of insecure patterns based on cultural differences in child-rearing practices. The scholar Michael Rutter in 1974 studied the importance of distinguishing between the consequences of attachment deprivation upon intellectual retardation in children and lack of development in the emotional growth in children. Rutter's conclusion was that a careful delineation of maternal attributes needed to be identified and differentiated for progress in the field to continue.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> secret <b>handshake</b> is <b>a</b> {{distinct}} form of handshake or greeting which conveys {{membership in}} or loyalty to a club, clique or subculture. The typical secret handshake involves placing one's fingers or thumbs {{in a particular}} position, one that will be recognized by fellow members while seeming to be <b>a</b> normal <b>handshake</b> to non-members. This is most frequently associated in the popular consciousness with college fraternities, fraternal orders and secret societies.|$|R
25|$|In two-way trunks with E and M signaling, <b>a</b> <b>handshake</b> {{took place}} to prevent both {{switches}} from colliding by dialing {{calls on the}} same trunk at the same time. By changing the state of these leads from ground to -48 volts, the switches stepped through <b>a</b> <b>handshake</b> protocol. Using DC voltage changes, the local switch would send a signal {{to get ready for}} a call and the remote switch would reply with an acknowledgment to go ahead with dial pulsing. This was done with relay logic and discrete electronics.|$|E
25|$|Any {{habitual}} pattern {{which is}} interrupted unexpectedly will cause sudden and light trance.

40|$|Abstract — Mobile-hierarchy {{architecture}} {{was widely}} adopted for query a deployed {{wireless sensor network}} in an intelligent transportation system recently.

For dividing virtual communication area, pre-negotiation should be conducted between mobile node and ordinary node before formal handshake. Pre- negotiation among nodes can increase the odds for <b>a</b> successful <b>handshake.</b> The mobile node negotiates with an ordinary sensor node over an insecure communication channel by private set intersection. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> important <b>handshake</b> factor, Attribute set is negotiated privately among them in local side. In this paper, <b>a</b> secure <b>handshake</b> scheme with pre-negotiation for mobile-hierarchy city intelligent transportation system under semi-honest model is proposed.
