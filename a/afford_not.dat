25|$|Agriculture {{advanced}} greatly {{under the}} Song. The Song government started {{a series of}} irrigation projects that increased cultivatable land, and encouraged peasants to cultivate more land. The total area of cultivated land was greatly increased to 720 million mou, a figure unsurpassed by later dynasties. A variety of crops were cultivated, unlike the monocultures of previous dynasties. Specialised crops like oranges and sugar cane were regularly planted alongside rice. Unlike the earlier self-sufficient peasantry of the Han and Tang eras, rural families produced a surplus which could be sold. The income allowed families to <b>afford</b> <b>not</b> only food, but charcoal, tea, oil, and wine. Many Song peasants supplemented their incomes with handicraft work.|$|E
500|$|Alternatively, the two {{variations}} of RAD may develop {{from the same}} inability to develop [...] "stranger-wariness" [...] due to inadequate care. Appropriate fear responses may {{only be able to}} develop after an infant has first begun to form a selective attachment. An infant who is {{not in a position to}} do this cannot <b>afford</b> <b>not</b> to show interest in any person as they may be potential attachment figures. Faced with a swift succession of carers the child may have no opportunity to form a selective attachment until the possible biologically-determined sensitive period for developing stranger-wariness has passed. It is thought this process may lead to the disinhibited form.|$|E

He said there were times when he felt like walking out. He found a valuable ally in Eric Sawyer, of the Littlewoods pools organisation, who joined the board not long after Shankly's appointment and shared Shankly's vision of Liverpool as the best club in England. At one board meeting in 1961 when Shankly insisted the club make offers for two players in Scotland, the board's initial response was that [...] "we can't afford them" [...] but Sawyer stepped in and said: [...] "We can't <b>afford</b> <b>not</b> to buy them".|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} sermon as {{associate}} rabbi, Danziger said [...] "we {{can afford to}} look Jewish {{after all these years}} and... out of self-respect alone, we cannot <b>afford</b> <b>not</b> to". As senior rabbi he slowly brought more traditional observances back to Temple Israel, moving it away from the radicalism of [...] "Classical Reform" [...] Judaism. These observances included the chanting of Torah blessings, a Torah procession through the sanctuary aisles, fasting on Yom Kippur, circumcising baby boys, and saying the kaddish for the deceased. In 1979, he gradually replaced the old Union Prayer Book with the new Gates of Prayer prayer book, and later began wearing a tallit while on the bimah. The changes were not uncontroversial, and the latter prompted one member to resign in protest. Though more traditional than his more recent predecessors, he was willing to perform intermarriages, but also counseled the couples as to the meaning of making a Jewish home. Danziger was involved in the Central Conference of American Rabbis and eventually became its president.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} the film, Hillenburg {{wanted to end}} the series [...] "so [...] wouldn't jump the shark." [...] "We're working on episodes 40 through 60 right now, and I always looked at that as a typical run for an animated show. [...] lasted about that long, for example. And I thought now {{was a good time}} to step aside and look at a different project. I personally think it's good not to go to the point where people don't want to see your show anymore," [...] Hillenburg said in 2002. However, Nickelodeon wanted to produce more episodes: [...] "The show was such a cash cow for the station that it couldn't <b>afford</b> <b>not</b> to," [...] storyboard director Sam Henderson observed. Initially Hillenburg doubted that the network would continue the show without him, saying: [...] "I think [...] respect that my contribution is important. I think they would want to maintain the original concept and quality." [...] Consequently, he resigned as the showrunner and appointed his trusted staff member Paul Tibbitt to the role. Although he no longer has a direct involvement in the production of SpongeBob SquarePants, he still retains a position as an executive producer and maintains an advisory role, reviewing each episode. While he was on the show, Hillenburg voiced Potty the Parrot and sat in with Derek Drymon at the record studio to direct the voice actors while they were recording. During the fourth season, Tibbitt took on voicing for Potty, while Andrea Romano replaced the two as the voice director.|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} in trade publications. The Moving Picture World remarked that the play itself was not well-known, {{but that the}} plot was depicted adequately enough that it may encourage a re-perusal of the play. There was no fault found by the reviewer who stated, [...] "The characters of Hardcastle, Kate and Marlow are admirably done and seem to correctly interpret the original. The staging and costuming are {{in harmony with the}} play and reproduce the scenery of the time depicted with accuracy. The usefulness of a work of this sort does not end with the presentation of the play itself. There is an educational value which includes the costuming and reproduction of the surroundings of the time. These are so unfamiliar now that they <b>afford</b> <b>not</b> a little addition to the interest and pleasure of such a film. The work has been done so well that the company deserves commendation for undertaking the task. It is not an easy manner to reproduce a play of this character, and when it is well done the company performing it deserves praise." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror disagreed on almost all points, [...] "In numerous details the illusion is dispelled, for the scenery is manifestly not of the eighteenth century. No contemporary of Goldsmith ever rode in such a barouche as appears in this film, nor lived in such a house as Mr. Hardcastle. The final tableau is as artificial as set pieces which have gone out of style at funerals. With all of its imperfections there is considerable of virile comedy in the film." [...] Though the Mirror reviewer stated that despite the elimination of the Hastings and Constance Neville subplot, the acting is clear enough that audiences do not need prior knowledge of the play to appreciate the film.|$|E

However, that was followed at 9:24pm by a telegram from Khrushchev to Kennedy, which was received at 10:52pm EDT. Khrushchev stated, [...] "if you weigh the present situation with a cool head without giving way to passion, you will understand that the Soviet Union cannot <b>afford</b> <b>not</b> to decline the despotic demands of the USA" [...] and that the Soviet Union views the blockade as [...] "an act of aggression" [...] and their ships will be instructed to ignore it.|$|E
2500|$|Antoine Roquentin – The {{protagonist of}} the novel, Antoine {{is a former}} adventurer who {{has been living in}} Bouville for three years. Antoine does not keep in touch with family, and has no friends. He is a loner at heart and often likes to listen to other people's conversations and examine their actions. He settles in the fictional French seaport town of Bouville to finish his {{research}} on the life of an 18th-century political figure. But during the winter of 1932 a [...] "sweetish sickness," [...] as he calls nausea, increasingly impinges on almost everything he does or enjoys: his research project, the company of an autodidact who is reading all the books in the local library alphabetically, a physical relationship with a café owner named Françoise, his memories of Anny, an English girl he once loved, even his own hands and the beauty of nature. Even though he at times admits to trying to find some sort of solace in the presence of others, he also exhibits signs of boredom and lack of interest when interacting with people. His relationship with Françoise is mostly hygienic in nature, for the two hardly exchange words and, when invited by the Self-Taught Man to accompany him for lunch, he agrees only to write in his diary later that: [...] "I had as much desire to eat with him as I had to hang myself." [...] He can <b>afford</b> <b>not</b> to work, but spends a lot of his time writing a book about a French politician of the eighteenth century. Antoine does not think highly of himself: [...] "The faces of others have some sense, some direction. Not mine. I cannot even decide whether it is handsome or ugly. I think it is ugly because I have been told so." [...] When he starts suffering from the Nausea he feels the need to talk to Anny, but when he finally does, it makes no difference to his condition. He eventually starts to think he does not even exist: [...] "My existence was beginning to cause me some concern. Was I a mere figment of the imagination?" ...|$|E
