500|$|The video {{begins with}} Beyoncé {{and her husband}} saying a few words, {{including}} [...] "intimacy", [...] "honesty", and [...] "commitment", and then saying the words [...] "you", [...] "me", and [...] "us" [...] together. When the action starts, Beyoncé is seen working as a police officer. Her husband (played by NFL player Eddie Goines) is very supportive. He makes her breakfast, spends time at work looking for a present for her and forgoes socializing with attractive coworkers so he can be available when his wife arrives home. However, Beyoncé is not thinking about him at all. Instead, she spends her free time with other officers, particularly her male partner, whom she seems enamored with. Her husband calls her, but she ignores the phone. Later, when her husband gives her earrings, she puts them on to go dancing with her partner at a party. Her husband is upset when he sees them, and when he confronts her about this, she acts like he is making <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> nothing. [...] "When you act like that, I don't think you realize how it makes me look or feel", he tells her. Beyoncé then asks him in a condescending tone, [...] "Why are you so jealous? It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy." [...] Then the story reverses, and Beyoncé starts to cry. Her husband's situation is actually her experience—he is a police officer who takes his supportive wife for granted.|$|E
2500|$|During an April 11, 2010, {{appearance}} on CNN, host Candy Crowley {{asked if it}} had been insensitive for Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell to omit mentioning slavery in a proposed recognition of Confederate History Month. Barbour replied, [...] "To me, it's a sort of feeling that it's a nit, that it is not significant, that it's not a—it's trying to make <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> something doesn't amount to diddly." [...] Barbour continued, [...] "I don't know what you would say about slavery ... but anybody that thinks that you have to explain to people that slavery is a bad thing, I think that goes without saying." ...|$|E
2500|$|The team {{originally}} used American football commentators, but we {{were asked}} to make [...] "everything more British," [...] so they hired English actor Hugh Dennis to perform the voice of Ralph and ex-footballer Ray Wilkins to perform the voice of Tony; Robinson recalled that Dennis' [...] "Eddie Waring-esque commentary" [...] was deliberately intended to contrasted with the [...] "dry and amusing delivery" [...] of Wilkins. Actors that were intended for the role of the Tango drinker were passed over as they did not like the idea of being slapped; the role ultimately went to an actor whose identity has not been discussed. Robinson praised him, saying that he was a [...] "really good actor, and he was just the best at reacting to being hit, he never made <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it," [...] calling his performance [...] "cool and dopey." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wei {{and other}} {{students}} testified that Ravi had told them that {{he was concerned about}} his possessions. Two of these students testified that Ravi also said he wanted to confirm that his roommate was gay. [...] Several students described Clementi's guest as [...] "shabby" [...] or [...] "shady". The prosecution argued that only Ravi and one other student had seen Clementi's guest in person and that the other student said the guest was not [...] "anything out of the ordinary" [...] and, while older, was [...] "not obscenely old". [...] None of the students said that Ravi had expressed any animosity towards gays. One student said that Ravi had called Clementi [...] "nice", and another said that Ravi had told him he had a gay friend. Wei said that Ravi mentioned that Clementi was gay, but [...] "didn't make <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it".|$|E
2500|$|Ishiro Honda {{wanted the}} theme of the movie to be a satire of the Television {{industry}} in Japan. In April 1962, TV networks and their various sponsors started producing outrageous programming and publicity stunts to grab audiences attention after two elderly viewers reportedly died at home while watching a violent wrestling match on TV. The various rating wars between the networks and banal programming that followed this event caused widespread debate over how TV would effect Japanese culture with Soichi Oya stating TV was creating [...] "a nation of 100 million idiots". Honda stated [...] "People were making <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ratings, but my own view of TV shows was that they did not take the viewer seriously, that they took the audience for granted....so I decided to show that through my movie" [...] and [...] "the reason I showed the monster battle through the prism of a ratings war was to depict the reality of the times". Honda addressed this by having a pharmaceutical company sponsor a TV show and going to extremes for a publicity stunt for ratings by capturing a giant monster stating [...] "All a medicine company would have to do is just produce good medicines you know? But the company doesn't think that way. They think they will get ahead of their competitors if they use a monster to promote their product.". Honda would work with screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa on developing the story stating that [...] "Back then Sekizawa was working on pop songs and TV shows so he really had a clear insight into television".|$|E

I was asked about it a lot, and I didn't really wanna make <b>a</b> <b>big</b> hairy <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> of it, because I just wanted the song to speak for itself. But the song is about when I was in high school, me and my girlfriend had to get an abortion, {{and it was a}} very sad thing. And, I didn't really want to write this song from any kind of {{political}} standpoint, or make a statement. I just wanted to reflect what it feels like.

40|$|I {{used to live}} in Washington DC, not {{far from}} a place I learned to call the 2 ̆ 2 U Street Corridor. 2 ̆ 2 I really had no idea why it was a 2 ̆ 2 {{corridor}} 2 ̆ 2 (most places in DC are just 2 ̆ 2 streets 2 ̆ 2) or why a lot of folks seemed to make <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> if it. Don 2 ̆ 7 t get me wrong. It was nice. There are coffee shops, jazz clubs, and the place is full of beautiful late Victorian architecture. But I confess I really didn 2 ̆ 7 t understand what the 2 ̆ 2 U Street Corridor 2 ̆ 2 was. Having read Blair Ruble 2 ̆ 7 s terrific Washington 2 ̆ 7 s U Street: A Biography (Johns Hopkins UP/Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 2010), I can confidently say that now I get it. U Street was arguably the first urban area in the post-bellum United States in which African Americans formed a vital, sophisticated, wealthy, and identifiably modern 2 ̆ 2 negro 2 ̆ 2 (as they would have said) culture. Today we take it for granted that African Americans make a vital contribution to the cultural life (though not only that) of the United States. At the end of the Civil War, that wasn 2 ̆ 7 t so. The vast majority of Blacks were southern, rural, and poor. If they appeared on the stage of national culture (and they almost never did), it was through the devices of minstrels in black-face. As Ruble points out, all that changed on U Street in the early 20 th century, the birthplace of modern African American culture. Now I know, and I 2 ̆ 7 m glad I do. Read the book, and you 2 ̆ 7 ll know too...|$|R

[...] Barack's response to the criticism was, [...] "Statements like this are made, and people try to take it out of context and make <b>a</b> great <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> of it, and that isn't at all what she meant. What she meant was, this is the first time that she's been proud of the politics of America," [...] he said.

5000|$|In a 2015 {{interview}} with Classicrockrevisited, Gramm explains his thoughts about why Head Games sold {{less than the}} first two: [...] "The big change in the band happened after Head Games and before Foreigner 4. We were really aware that Head Games didn't sell {{nearly as much as}} the first album or Double Vision. Part of that was because of the cover. The song [...] "Head Games" [...] was banned by a lot of radio stations after the cover of the album came out. Today, that would not have even been a problem. But in the Bible Belt, the cover of the cute little girl in the boys' bathroom erasing her number off the wall... They didn't see the humor in that. It wasn't supposed to even be sexy. She was sexy....she was cute. It was just the time and the place of what she was doing that was supposed to leave the impression. She was erasing her phone number off the wall of the boys' bathroom and that's all it was. <b>A</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> was made <b>out</b> of that and it really hurt our sales." ...|$|R
