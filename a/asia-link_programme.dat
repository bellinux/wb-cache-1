40|$|Textile {{biomedical}} materials {{have been used}} for various applications contributing considerably in improving quality of life. The current study aims at improving polypropylene fibre stents which may replace metallic ones. In order to produce the stents, weft-knitting and braiding technologies were used. In the braiding technique, by varying the takeup ratio (using gears with the appropriate number of teeth in the braiding machine), it was possible to manufacture regular braids with angles of 65 °, 70 ° and 75 ° in order to obtain different covers. In the knitting technique, a circular machine was used and the tightness of the structure was adjusted by varying the loop length and thus the fabric loop density, resulting in variations of the sample diameter. The knitting machine had negative feed, and so loop length variations were achieved by varying the yarn input tension, the stitch cam settings and the fabric take-down tension. The samples were heat set. Yarns were contracted by setting at 130 ° C and 140 ° C, and this led to increasing the loop density and the flexural rigidity of the samples. A high cover of the samples resulted in a greater stiffness of the structures. The stents were evaluated by undertaking the tests required for arterial support: rigidity to radial compression, resistance to tensile forces and bending rigidity. The best results were obtained with braided structures. Future work may concentrate in improving the stent design and using new biocompatible fibres.

40|$|Copyright @ 2010 International Association of Technology, Education and DevelopmentFinally, {{the time}} has arrived {{in which there is}} a shared opinion that {{sustainable}} development requires a system discontinuity, meaning that radical changes in the way we produce, consume and socially interacts are needed. Finally, {{the time has}} arrived {{in which there is a}}n emerging understanding that an important contribution to this change can be directly linked to the role of the design. However we have to admit that the designers are still more part of the problem, than part of the solution, i. e. proactive and diffused actors of the radical change requested by the transition towards a sustainable society. Within the so called learning society, new visions and tools are urgently requested for the design. A new political agenda is needed, looking at all of the of the design’s bodies (the designers, the design educators and the design researchers) as a learning community that urgently needs to accelerate the process of consolidation and diffusion of the new knowledge and know-how, for a new generation of designers. Under this perspective, a key role should be played by the design schools. The paper will explore this issue and in its framework presents the vision, the ambitions and the tools developed within the Learning Network on Sustainability (LeNS) project, an Asian- European multi-polar network for curricula development on Design for Sustainability, financed by the European Commission under the <b>Asia-Links</b> <b>programme...</b>|$|R
40|$|Copyright @ 2009 CARMAIt is {{a shared}} opinion that {{sustainable}} development requires a system discontinuity, meaning that radical {{changes in the}} way we produce and consume are needed. Within this framework there is an emerging understanding that an important contribution to this change can be directly linked to decisions taken in the design phase. For this reason design schools have therefore to be able to provide design students with a broad knowledge and effective Design for Sustainability tools, in order to enable a new generation of designers in playing an active role in reorienting our consumption and production patterns. Under this perspective, there is a pressing need of mechanisms that act at the education level, enabling design educators (and researchers) to share knowledge in this field. Along this direction this paper presents the intermediate results of the Learning Network on Sustainability (LeNS) project, an Asian-European multi-polar network for curricula development on Design for Sustainability focused on (Product-Service) System innovation, financed by the European Commission under the <b>Asia-Links</b> <b>programme</b> 2. LeNS is a mechanism to develop and diffuse system design for sustainability in design schools with a transcultural perspective. The main output of the project will be the Open Learning E-Package (OLEP), an open web platform that allows a decentralised and collaborative production and fruition of knowledge produced as learning subsidies. It can be described as a modular e-package of teaching materials (texts, slide shows, audio, video, etc) and tools for designers, that design educators (but also students and professionals as designers, entrepreneurs and interested persons/ institutions) worldwide will be able to download (free of charge), modify, remix and reuse (copy left). Apart from the contents, the same LeNS web platform is realised in an open-source and copy left ethos, allowing its download and reconfiguration in relation to specific needs, area of interest and interested partners. Within this perspective one of this hypothesis is about the setting up of an African Learning Network on Sustainability, which, taking in consideration the local needs, interests and opportunities, could represent a significant enabling platform capable to sensitise, support and empower a new generation of African design educators, designers and entrepreneurs to reach design practice throughout an open collaborative learning approach...|$|R
40|$|Structure {{property}} correlation is {{a critical}} textile research area explored by various researchers and many factors have been proposed {{over the years to}} predict/compare/design the woven fabrics. Cross-over firmness factor (CFF) and floating yarn factor (FYF) have been recently proposed as parameters to understand weave effect on fabric properties (Morino, H., Matsudaira, M. and Furutani, M. (2005). Predicting Mechanical Properties and Hand Values from the Parameters of Weave Structures, Textile Research Journal, 75 (3) : 252 — 257). Redefined CFF and FYF factors using fabric fields in terms of interlacement index (I) and float index (F), respectively have been proposed in this article. This new approach provides better understanding of the interlacements and floats in the woven structure and further they are applied on multilayer interlocked fabrics to quantify the structural influence on the properties. Multilayer interlocked woven fabrics with different interlacement patterns have been developed. Influence of fabric structure on preform properties relevant for resin transfer molding composite manufacture, such as compression, permeability, and tensile behavior were studied with respect to the interlacement and float indices. Tensile and compression tests were conducted on universal testing machine. Liquid permeability of these structures was evaluated based on horizontal wicking and contact angle wettability tests. Results show that influence of structural factor is greater on tensile and permeability properties than the compression properties of these multilayer fabricsThis work has been conducted within the <b>Asia-Link</b> <b>Programme</b> RPO 1736, project no IN/ASIA-LINK/ 002 (82158).

40|$|Economic and {{institutional}} reforms in East and Southeast Asia have caused impressive {{economic growth and}} improved the livelihood of millions of people. In several regions, however, this growth has been obtained {{at the expense of}} land quality or to the detriment of other natural resources. As a consequence, the sustainability of future growth is threatened. Efforts aimed at promoting sustainable resource use in rural East and Southeast Asia are being and will be confronted with and influenced by two major changes. First, the continuous transition towards a market-oriented economy implies that massive, centralized state regulation will decrease and that economic, decentralized and informal resource management institutions are likely to increase in importance. Second, domestic economic liberalization, international trade liberalization and globalization will greatly affect domestic agricultural prices and, hence, the use of natural resources. This volume contains a selection of papers that were presented at the Asia-Link RECREATE seminar at the University of Economics, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, in June 2007 and the international Asia-Link RECREATE conference at Nanjing Agriculture University, China, in October 2008. The seminar, the conference and the publication of this book are part of Asia-Link's "Restructuring Higher Education in Resource and Environmental Economics" project activities, which have been funded by the European Union under its <b>Asia-Link</b> <b>programme.</b> The selected papers provide an overview, albeit not a complete one, regarding the environmental and natural resource problems Southeast Asian countries are facing from an economic perspective. The papers are written in such a way so that they can serve as supporting case study material for classes in environmental and natural resource economics at the graduate level. The editors also expect that environmental and natural resource economists with an interest in Southeast Asia will find the various chapters of interest as well as stimulating for their own research...|$|E
