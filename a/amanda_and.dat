5|$|The 1970s and 1980s saw {{a wave of}} landbased pirate radio, {{broadcasting}} {{mostly in}} big cities. These included community-focused local stations such as Sunshine Radio in Shropshire and Radio Jackie in south west London. In London pirate stations emerged that, {{for the first time}} in UK radio broadcasting, focused on particular music genres such as Radio Invicta (92.4 FM) Europe's first soul station, started in 1970. Kiss FM (dance), Solar Radio (soul), Raiders FM, Radio <b>Amanda</b> <b>and</b> Radio Floss (rock) and Dread Broadcasting Corporation (reggae).|$|E
5|$|To {{reinforce}} {{the connection with}} Love's Last Shift and capitalise on its unexpected success, Vanbrugh designed the central roles of Loveless, <b>Amanda,</b> <b>and</b> Sir Novelty for the same actors: John Verbruggen, Jane Rogers, and Colley Cibber.

Filling {{the rest of the}} large Relapse cast presented a varied palette of problems, which forced some unconventional emergency casting.|$|E
