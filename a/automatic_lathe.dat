5|$|Francis Penny Burnage, {{son-in-law}} of Charles, became {{chairman of}} Charles Churchill & Co, and Gabriel {{continued to work}} for that company. They moved quickly to add manufacturing capacity to what {{would otherwise have been}} just a sales organisation: in December 1934 the company took over Cornelius Redman & Sons, renaming it Churchill-Redman Ltd. The facility was used initially to manufacture American machine tools under licence, rather as the machine tool company had started out in the early 1900s. A particularly notable example of its output was the licence granted in 1937 by Jones & Lamson of Springfield, Vermont, for the Fay <b>automatic</b> <b>lathe.</b> It was to become a pattern for Gabriel to orchestrate take-overs of other companies but not subsume them: they would have their own management team and retain a separate corporate identity.|$|E

50|$|The Fay <b>automatic</b> <b>lathe</b> was an <b>automatic</b> <b>lathe</b> {{tailored}} to cutting workpieces that were mounted on centers (tools with pointed ends to accurately position a center-drilled workpiece about an axis, {{either directly or}} by using a mandrel). It could also do chucking work (feeding of unformed blanks or pieces of stock from a magazine to be automatically gripped by the machine for turning). Examples of workpieces included automotive steering knuckles and transmission gears, and such work done on mandrels as flanges, disks, and hubs. The machine tool was developed by F.C. Fay of Philadelphia and improved by Otto A. Schaum. It was originally manufactured by the Fay & Scott Machine Shop.

50|$|An <b>automatic</b> <b>lathe</b> {{may have}} a single spindle or {{multiple}} spindles. Each spindle contains a bar or blank of material that is being machined simultaneously. A common configuration is six spindles. The cage that holds these six bars of material indexes after each machining operation is complete. The indexing is reminiscent of a Gatling gun.|$|E

50|$|Fully <b>automatic</b> {{mechanical}} <b>lathes,</b> employing cams {{and gear}} trains for controlled movement, are called screw machines.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{historical}} path of development of machine tool technology, the natural language terminology used to name <b>automatic</b> <b>lathes,</b> at least in English, is not hierarchical in quite {{the way that a}} manufacturing layperson might expect. Retronymy (and, in other respects, lack of retronymy) have shaped the nomenclature. However, it is easy enough to understand once a bit of history is known (as explained below).|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "automatic lathe" [...] {{is still}} {{often used in}} {{manufacturing}} in its earlier sense, referring to automated lathes of non-CNC types. The first kinds of <b>automatic</b> <b>lathes</b> were mechanically automated ones (whose control is via cams or tracers and pantographs). Thus, before electronic automation via numerical control, programmable logic controllers, and so on, the [...] "automatic" [...] in the term [...] "automatic machine tool" [...] always referred implicitly to mechanical automation.|$|R
50|$|An {{automatic}} chucking {{machine is}} very similar to an automatic screw machine, except it handles larger work, which due to its size is more often chucking work and less often bar work. The Fay <b>automatic</b> <b>lathe</b> was a variant that specialized in turning work on centers. While a screw machine is limited to around 80 mm practice, automatic chuckers are available that can handle up to 300 mm chucks. The chucks are air-operated. Many of these machines are multispindle (more than one main spindle).|$|E
5000|$|An <b>automatic</b> <b>lathe</b> is a lathe (usually a {{metalworking}} lathe) whose {{actions are}} controlled automatically. Although all electronically controlled (CNC) lathes are automatic, {{they are usually}} not called by that name, as explained under [...] "General nomenclature". The first kinds of automatic lathes were mechanically automated ones, from the 1870s until the advent of NC and CNC in the 1950s and 1960s. CNC has not yet entirely displaced mechanically automated machines. The latter type of machine tool is no longer being newly built, but many existing examples remain in service.|$|E

50|$|To chuck a tool or {{workpiece}} {{is to hold}} it with a chuck, {{in which}} case it has been chucked. Lathe work whose workholding involves chucking individual slugs or blanks is often called chucking work, in contrast to bar work or bar feed work. In bar work the bar protrudes from the chuck, is worked upon, then cut off by a lathe tool (parted off) rather than being sawn off. <b>Automatic</b> <b>lathes</b> that specialize in chucking work are often called chuckers.|$|R
5000|$|In 1937 Roe, {{writing for}} the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, framed the {{importance}} of the Fay <b>automatic</b> <b>lathe</b> to the capabilities of machine tools by saying that, [...] "This machine does for the engine lathe what Spencer did for the old hand-operated turret lathe." [...] These machines took an entire class of turned work formerly requiring an operator to execute the series of movements necessary to shape a piece of metal (manual control) and allowed the same work to be done automatically. This step forward in automation lowered a manufacturer's unit expense per part by reducing labor costs. Today, numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools such as turning centers, turn-mills, and rotary transfer machines have largely supplanted cam-operated automatics.|$|E
