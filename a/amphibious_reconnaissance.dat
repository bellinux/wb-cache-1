5|$|By 17 June, Allied planes began {{operating}} from Labuan airfield and the 2/43rd Battalion was transferred across Brunei Bay to the mainland, landing at Menumbok and Mempakul, after an <b>amphibious</b> <b>reconnaissance,</b> {{along with the}} 2/11th Commando Squadron. Two companies and the battalion headquarters landed at Mempakul on 19 June, and the 2/43rd subsequently advanced up the Klias River, using barges and landing craft, while the 2/32nd Battalion advanced along the Padas River. By late June, the two battalions converged on Beaufort, linking up {{to the west of}} Kandu, and between 26 and 29 June 1945, the town was the scene of heavy fighting during which the 2/43rd lost 13 men killed and 30 wounded. The 2/43rd was tasked with taking the high ground {{to the north of the}} town around the Woodford Estate and Mount Lawley, and carrying out a flanking attack to the east. For his actions in destroying four Japanese machine-gun positions, Private Tom Starcevich was awarded the Victoria Cross. After the capture of Beaufort, the fighting continued in the area as the 2/28th Battalion kept up the pressure on the withdrawing Japanese; for the 2/43rd, though, Beaufort proved to be the last significant action of the war, as hostilities ended in mid-August, following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The battalion's final campaign of the war cost it 56 casualties, including those killed or wounded on Labuan.|$|E

25|$|The {{historical}} {{roots of}} 'Force Recon' companies {{can be traced}} back to the antecedent <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Reconnaissance</b> Battalion, whose numerous pre-D–Day reconnoitering of enemy beaches during the Pacific campaigns of World War II proved the vitality of the Fleet Marine Force's <b>amphibious</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> doctrine. This unique unit reported directly to the landing force commander, providing him important intelligence at his disposal.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Reconnaissance</b> Company (and later Battalion) were a {{small group}} of men that {{conducted}} preliminary D-Day <b>amphibious</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> of the planned littoral beaches occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army and Special Naval Landing Forces in the Central Pacific during World War II. They were infantry Marines highly skilled in combat swimming, topography, and hydrographic survey that provided the V Amphibious Corps, which subsequently was redesignated under the Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, vital military intelligence of Japanese enemy forces.|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} {{mission of}} Force Recon is reconnaissance, to collect any pertinent intelligence of military importance, observe, identify and report adversaries to MAGTF commanders. Like Division Recon (also {{known as the}} Marine Recon Battalions), they employ a mixed element of <b>amphibious</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> and ground reconnaissance. These missions are known as green operations. This practice fundamentally covers {{a wide spectrum of}} reconnaissance but primarily the FORECON operators conduct deep reconnaissance.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} World War II, the Amphib Recon Battalion {{terminated}} its command; its Marines either {{filled the}} ranks of other infantry platoons, or folded into the Scout (Tank) companies, and the newly formed division reconnaissance companies. This force-level reconnaissance element was not re-established until the early 1950s, when the <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Reconnaissance</b> Battalions were assembled for preliminary operations in Korea. Their efforts proved that gaining {{the knowledge of the}} enemy before a major operation was crucial to safeguarding the men, and provided better operational planning.|$|E
25|$|Marine {{reconnaissance}} are specialized {{teams that}} are proficient in special, ground and <b>amphibious</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> to collect intelligence for the commanders within the Marine Air-Ground Task Force to shape the commander's battlespace. The division recon assets conduct recon for battalions and regiments by operating ahead of the forces to scout enemy and other pertinent information. The force recon assets are reserved for the high-echelon of the force commander. Force recon also may be directed to perform direct action operations or other special assignments to the Marine Expeditionary Force.|$|E

The 100th Naval Construction Battalion began to improve the airfield creating a coral-surfaced 5800 ft by 445 ft runway covering most of Delap Island. By mid-March the airfield was in limited operation and by 15 April the airfield, taxiways, aprons, housing, shops, and piers were fully operational. The Seebees also constructed roads and causeways linking Delap to the adjacent islands. The carrier replacement plane pool was subsequently located at Majuro and a new 4000 ft by 175 ft runway was built on Uliga Island and a two-lane causeway connecting Uliga and Delap was constructed. An 800 ft by 150 ft apron was cleared and paved adjacent to the main runway to facilitate transport operations.|$|R
