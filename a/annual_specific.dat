40|$|In {{the past}} years the Norwegian PV market has grown substantially. The {{importance}} {{of data on}} how PV systems perform in Norway is therefore also increasing. In this thesis several Norwegian PV systems are analyzed mainly in terms of <b>annual</b> <b>specific</b> yields. The systems are located in western and southeastern Norway and near horizontal, tilted and vertical modules are looked at. Results show pretty similar performance of the near horizontal systems, so-called east/west applications, with 700 kWh/kWp being an approximate average <b>annual</b> <b>specific</b> yield. Vertical systems show large variations in yield due to shading losses and suboptimal orientations. Nonetheless, vertical systems having been placed well show great potential, having <b>annual</b> <b>specific</b> yields {{on the order of}} 700 kWh/kWp while producing far better than near horizontal systems in winter months. Not surprisingly systems tilted 30 or more give the highest yields, slighty above 900 kWh/kWp seeming like a fair approximation for the <b>annual</b> <b>specific</b> yield of such systems in southern Norway. The measured yields have also been compared to estimated yield, giving a rough average deviation of 5 %. Irradiation data from 57 locations in Norway has also been gathered, confirming that the average annual irradiation lies somewhere between 700 and 1000 kWh/m 2. The three irradiation models/databases Meteonorm 7. 1, PVGIS and NASA SSE have been compared to this data by the means of RMS errors, indicating that Meteonorm and PVGIS perform similarly while the NASA database is less precise. Large local differences are observed though, making some models preferable in certain locations. Simulations performed in PVsyst using average global and diffuse irradiation data from Trondheim, Bergen and Ås show that the increase in yield gotten from tilting a PV system varies not only with latitude but also the amount of diffuse irradiation at each location. Results indicate that the overall relative increase in yield gotten from tilting is the lowest in Bergen and highest in Ås, while the increase from tilting modules 10 is highest in Trondheim...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of analyses and research into the magnitude and long-term course variability, as well as spatial distribution of water resources (expressed as the mean <b>annual</b> <b>specific</b> discharge) within an agricultural area which is particularly threatened by water deficit. The long-term analyses relied on the data retrieved from the monitoring network of the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management (IMGW) for the period 1951 - 2012. The spatial distribution of water resources was depicted {{on the basis of the}} data obtained from own observation facilities. The hydrological image of the river basin concerns two extremes: the years which were either anomalously wet or dry. The average long-term (1951 - 2012) specific discharge from the Zgłowiączka river basin stood at 2. 51 dm 3 ·s- 1 ·km 2. On the basis of the direction of the moving trend line of the mean <b>annual</b> <b>specific</b> discharge, three characteristic periods have been identified: 1951 - 1980 – the increasing trend, 1981 - 1991 – the decreasing trend and 1992 - 2011 – the increasing trend.

The discharge in the dry year (2012) was 1. 30 dm 3 ·s- 1 ·km- 2.

40|$|Abstract. Observations of high-elevation {{meteorological}} conditions, glacier mass balance, and glacier run-off are sparse {{in western}} Canada and the Canadian Rocky Moun-tains, leading to {{uncertainty about the}} importance of glaciers to regional water resources.

40|$|Sediment fluxes within {{continental}} areas play a {{major role}} in the global biogeochemical cycles and are often at the source of soil surface degradation as well as water and ecosystems pollution. In a context of significant land use and climate change, it appears important to be able to carry out sediment budgets to assess potential future impacts induced by such changes. The purpose of this study is to examine the source-to-sink dynamic of the sediment cycle for 123 small to medium catchments (10 to 10 ^ 4 km²) distributed over the Loire River basin (France). To this aim, three different steps will be carried out. First, estimations of mean <b>annual</b> <b>specific</b> sediment load for the 123 catchments are estimated from suspended sediment concentration and water discharge measurements at basin outlets over the past four decades. Secondly, catchment global parameters (topography, landuse, drainage density [...] .) and simple indices, combining these parameters, will be calculated to study the relationship between hillslope production and sediment load at basins outlet. Finally, we will focus on the development of a distributed modelling approach of on-land sediment transfer processes. Special attention will be given to hillslope runoff and sediment connectivity by taking into account landscape spatial organisation and linear pathways as determinant features for sediment transport. The results from the first step on mean <b>annual</b> <b>specific</b> sediment loads, show that catchments contribute from 30 to 4 * 10 ^ 5 t. yr- 1 to the overall Loire river sediment exports (which equals 10 ^ 11 t. yr- 1). Investigations on catchments global characteristics should then allow the identification of dominant processes in sediment redistribution, help to draw local and then regional distributed sediment budgets and bridge the gap between the different spatial scales. Contribution of hillslopes to the overall catchment budget should finally help to assess in-stream contributions and redistribution processes. Contributions of on-land sediment sources and transfer to the overall catchment budget should finally help to assess in-stream contributions and redistribution processes...|$|E

The 205 ± 1 km 2 ice shelf experienced a 28 % (82 ± 0. 8 km 2) reduction in area between 1950 – 2009, and a 20 % (2. 5 ± 0. 9 km 3 water equivalent (w. e.)) reduction in volume between 1981 – 2008 / 2009, suggesting a long-term state of negative mass balance. Comparison of mean <b>annual</b> <b>specific</b> mass balances (up to - 0. 34 m w. e. yr- 1) with surface mass balance measurements for the nearby Ward Hunt Ice Shelf suggest that basal melt is a key contributor to total ice shelf thinning.
