On June 27, 1958, AASHO adopted their original numbering plan for Michigan, minus the state's proposed changes.

5|$|In 1969, General António Augusto dos Santos was {{relieved}} of command, with General Kaúlza de Arriaga taking over officially in March 1970. Kaúlza de Arriaga favoured <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> method of fighting the insurgents, and the established policy of using African counter-insurgency forces was rejected {{in favour of}} the deployment of regular Portuguese forces accompanied by {{a small number of}} African fighters. Indigenous personnel were still recruited for special operations, such as the Special Groups of Parachutists in 1973, though their role less significant under the new commander. His tactics were partially influenced by a meeting with United States General William Westmoreland.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s CDOT began {{considering}} {{plans for a}} replacement bridge.

After a public hearing in August 2012, the agency announced that the latter seemed to be overwhelmingly preferred.

Creger radioed Bouck and told him of the Germans advancing through Lanzerath on the road between Creger and Bouck's position. Bouck sent Robinson, McGeehee and Silvola to assist Creger, who crept down to the Bucholz Station road and thence up a ditch towards Lanzerath. Before the three men reached Creger, he left the village using <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> route.

5|$|M-62 {{was formed}} before 1924 along {{a portion of}} its current routing. The {{trunkline}} started at the Indiana state line and ran north through Edwardsburg and Cassopolis. The northern terminus was at M-40 (now M-51) in Dowagiac. The southern section was moved {{by the end of}} 1925 to follow <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> routing between Edwardsburg and the state line. An extension in 1930 moved the northern terminus west into Berrien County, ending in Eau Claire. The final few miles of highway were transferred back in local control around 1957. Before the transfer, M-62 ran concurrently with M-140 west and continued into Eau Claire. After the transfer, M-62 ended at the eastern M-140 junction and the concurrency was removed.|$|E

5|$|Orson Welles' stage {{production}} of Macbeth sets the play in Haiti, and casts the witches as voodoo priestesses.

The witches encroach further and further into his domain as the play progresses, appearing in the forest in the first scene and in the castle itself by the end. Directors often have difficulty keeping the witches from being exaggerated and overly-sensational.|$|E
5|$|The A3 {{section of}} Zagreb bypass is {{currently}} the busiest section of the Croatian motorway network, with annual average daily traffic (AADT) volume exceeding 40,000vehicles, leading to congestion of the six-lane bypass at peak hours, especially during the summer, when tourist traffic adds to the congestion. The mainline toll plazas at Bobovica and Ivanja Reka can both become bottlenecks at such times. The alternative to the bypass is going through the city via Ljubljanska, Zagrebačka and Slavonska avenues. Despite being a shorter and <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> route, those avenues are much more congested than the bypass at rush hours and they contain at-grade intersections and traffic lights at some of their junctions.|$|E
5|$|The Fort Steuben Bridge, {{originally}} the Weirton-Steubenville Bridge, was a suspension bridge which spanned the Ohio River from Steubenville, Ohio to Weirton, West Virginia and carried U.S. Route 22 and then Ohio State Route 822 during its existence. Completed in 1928 and opened as a toll bridge, the Fort Steuben Bridge was <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> route for {{the flow of}} traffic across the river; particularly for trucks and heavy vehicles from the industrial area.

5|$|The {{two general}} routes {{followed}} by the Butterfield Overland Stage and the Southern Pacific Railroad—known respectively as the Tejon Pass Route and the Tehachapi or Midway Route – were the main automobile routes between Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley around {{the start of the}} 20th century. The State Bureau of Highways recommended in 1895 that <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> route be built to shorten this distance. A bond issue was approved in 1909 and 1910 to build a state highway system, including the Ridge Route. The new California Highway Commission was unable to raise funds in the East, but Los Angeles again contributed funds to ensure that construction would go forward.|$|E
5|$|US-59 {{was first}} {{designated}} in Oklahoma around 1935.

US-59 was changed to follow the present-day route in 1951. Since then, US-59 has undergone only minor adjustments, many of which eliminated curves and provided <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> route for travelers using the highway to traverse eastern Oklahoma.|$|E
5|$|When {{parliament}} {{passed the}} building of the Bergen Line in 1894, the Roa–Hønefoss branch line was made part of the plans; but the line was given a separate name indicating that the Bergen Line would continue from Hønefoss to Oslo in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>direct</b> route. But after the finish of the Bergen Line, other important mainline routes, in particular the Dovre Line, Sørland Line and Nordland Line, combined with the effort to convert narrow gauge line, took precedence. Ideas for the additional construction of the Ringerike Line were pressed by commercial interests in Ringerike in both 1890 and 1906, but failed both times.|$|E
