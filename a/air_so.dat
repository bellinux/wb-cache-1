5|$|Hypothermia {{is reduced}} body {{temperature}} {{that happens when}} a body loses more heat than it generates. Hypothermia is a major limitation to swimming or diving in cold water. The reduction in finger dexterity due to pain or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which in turn {{increases the risk of}} other injuries. Body heat is lost much more quickly in water than in <b>air,</b> <b>so</b> water temperatures that would be tolerable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to hypothermia, which may lead to death from other causes in inadequately protected divers.|$|E
25|$|Small numbers {{refer to}} ISO 14644-1 standards, which specify the decimal {{logarithm}} {{of the number}} of particles 0.1µm or larger permitted per m3 of <b>air.</b> <b>So,</b> for example, an ISO class 5 cleanroom has at most 105 particles/m3.|$|E
25|$|Breathing {{involves}} expelling {{stale air}} from their one blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh {{air into the}} lungs. Spout shapes differ among species, which facilitates identification. The spout only forms when warm air from the lungs meets cold <b>air,</b> <b>so</b> it does not form in warmer climates, as with river dolphins.|$|E

25|$|A small, {{enclosed}} {{fire that}} has slowed down may require vigorous blowing {{to get it}} going again, but excess blowing can extinguish a fire. Most large fires easily create their own circulation, even in unfavorable conditions, but the variant log-cabin fire-build suffers from a chronic lack of <b>air</b> <b>so</b> long as the initial structure is maintained.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the only}} {{eyewitness}} account available, written by Melchior Estácio do Amaral in 1604: the sea was purple with blood dripping from the scuppers, the decks cluttered with {{the dead and the}} fire raging {{in some parts of the}} ships, and the <b>air</b> <b>so</b> filled with smoke that, not only we could sometimes not see each other but we could not recognize each other.|$|E
25|$|In {{automobiles}} {{and other types}} of vehicles (including piston-powered airplanes, boats, trucks, etc.), diesel or gasoline engines power output can be increased by compressing the intake <b>air,</b> <b>so</b> that more fuel can be burned per cycle. These engines can power compressors using their own crankshaft power (this setup known as a supercharger), or, use their exhaust gas to drive a turbine connected to the compressor (this setup known as a turbocharger).|$|E
5000|$|Belushi {{also made}} a [...] "Guest Star Appearance" [...] on an episode of the {{television}} series Police Squad! (1982), which showed him underwater wearing cement shoes. He died shortly before the episode <b>aired,</b> <b>so</b> the scene was cut and replaced by a segment with William Conrad.|$|R

25|$|At {{temperatures}} above 550°C {{the equilibrium}} CO2 pressure begins {{to exceed the}} CO2 pressure in <b>air.</b> <b>So</b> above 550°C, calcium carbonate begins to outgas CO2 into air. However, in a charcoal fired kiln, the concentration of CO2 will be much higher {{than it is in}} air. Indeed, if all the oxygen in the kiln is consumed in the fire, then the partial pressure of CO2 in the kiln can be as high as 20 kPa.|$|E
25|$|The Cave of Crystals is a horseshoe-shaped cavity in limestone. Its {{floor is}} covered with {{perfectly}} faceted crystalline blocks. Huge crystal beams jut out from both the blocks and the floor. The caves are accessible today because the mining company's pumping operations keep them clear of water. If the pumping were stopped, the caves would again be submerged in water. The crystals deteriorate in <b>air,</b> <b>so</b> the Naica Project is attempting to visually document the crystals before they deteriorate further.|$|E
25|$|Hypothermia {{is reduced}} body {{temperature}} {{that happens when}} a body dissipates more heat than it absorbs. Hypothermia is a major limitation to swimming or diving in cold water. The reduction in finger dexterity due to pain or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which consequently {{increases the risk of}} other injuries. Body heat is lost much more quickly in water than in <b>air,</b> <b>so</b> water temperatures that would be quite reasonable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to hypothermia in inadequately protected divers, although it is not often the direct clinical cause of death.|$|E

25|$|Driven by live {{coverage}} of the year's US presidential election, 2016 was CNN's most-watched year in its history. Throughout the campaign, the network aired unedited coverage of many of the Trump campaign rallies. Aides for Republican candidates Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Ted Cruz accused CNN president Jeff Zucker of undermining their candidates during the Republican primaries. Zucker acknowledged that it had been a mistake to <b>air</b> <b>so</b> many of the campaign rallies. CNN also drew criticism during the election for hiring former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who was still being paid by and was effectively working on behalf of the campaign.|$|E
25|$|Most {{high-pressure}} breathing {{gas compressors}} {{are designed to}} accept intake gas at normal atmospheric pressure. {{and one of the}} usual components for breathing gas mixtures for diving is atmospheric <b>air,</b> <b>so</b> it is convenient to blend the gases at atmospheric pressure in an accessory to the compressor called a mixing tube or blending stick. The mixing tube may be constructed in a variety of ways, providing that it does not unduly restrict flow, and adequately mixes the gases before analysis and before intake into the compressor. A large range of commercially produced and home made blending tubes have been successfully used.|$|E
25|$|In a {{convection}} heater, {{the heating}} element heats {{the air in}} contact with it by thermal conduction. Hot air is less dense than cool <b>air,</b> <b>so</b> it rises due to buoyancy, allowing more cool air to flow in to take its place. This sets up a convection current of hot air that rises from the heater, heats up the surrounding space, cools and then repeats the cycle. These heaters are sometimes filled with oil. They are ideally suited for heating a closed space. They operate silently and have a lower risk of ignition hazard if they make unintended contact with furnishings compared to radiant electric heaters.|$|E

25|$|The beer is {{generally}} brewed from a grist containing approximately 60–70% barley malt and 30–40% unmalted wheat. The wort is cooled overnight in a shallow, flat metal pan called a coolship {{where it is}} left exposed to the open <b>air</b> <b>so</b> microorganisms may inoculate the wort. While this cooling method of open air exposure is a critical feature of the style, the key yeasts and bacteria that perform the fermentation reside within the breweries' timber fermenting vessels. Over eighty microorganisms {{have been identified in}} lambic beer, the most significant being Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces pastorianus and Brettanomyces bruxellensis. The process {{is generally}} only possible between October and May as in the summer months there are too many unfavourable organisms in the air that could spoil the beer.|$|E
25|$|After {{soaking in}} {{water to make}} the skins workable, the skins were placed on a {{stretching}} frame. A simple frame with nails would work well in stretching the pelts. The skins could be attached by wrapping small, smooth rocks in the skins with rope or leather strips. Both sides would be left open to the <b>air</b> <b>so</b> they could be scraped with a sharp, semi-lunar knife to remove {{the last of the}} hair and get the skin to the right thickness. The skins, which were made almost entirely of collagen, would form a natural glue while drying and once taken off the frame they would keep their form. The stretching aligned the fibres to be more nearly parallel to the surface.|$|E
25|$|Stanislav Pokrovsky – Russian general {{director}} of a scientific-manufacturing enterprise Project-D-MSK who calculated that the real speed of the Saturn V rocket at S-IC staging time was only half of what was declared. His analysis appears {{to assume that the}} solid rocket plumes from the fuselage and retrorockets on the two stages came to an instant halt in the surrounding <b>air</b> <b>so</b> they can be used to estimate the velocity of the rocket. He ignored high-altitude winds and the altitude at staging, 67km, where air is about 1/10,000 as dense as at sea level, and claimed that only a loop around the Moon was possible, not a manned landing on the Moon with return to Earth. He also allegedly found the reason for this – problems with the Inconel superalloy used in the F-1 engine.|$|E

25|$|From March to June 1926, Horne was {{a member}} of the first class of captains persuaded by Bureau of Aeronautics chief William A. Moffett to undergo flight {{training}} at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. A new law restricted the command of aircraft carriers, tenders, squadrons, and aviation shore establishments to qualified naval aviators or naval aviation observers. Qualification as a naval aviator required a demanding 200 hours in the <b>air,</b> <b>so</b> most older officers opted for the less rigorous designation of naval aviation observer, which required only 100 hours in the air. Horne qualified as a naval aviation observer along with most of the other captains in his class, which included future three- and four-star admirals Joseph M. Reeves, Harry E. Yarnell, Alfred Wilkinson Johnson, and Henry V. Butler.|$|E
25|$|As {{a nearly}} {{universal}} standard practice in modern recreational diving, the typical single-hose regulator has a spare demand valve fitted for emergency {{use by the}} diver's buddy, typically {{referred to as the}} octopus because of the extra hose, or secondary demand valve. The octopus was invented by Dave Woodward at UNEXSO around 1965-6 to support the free dive attempts of Jacques Mayol. Woodward believed that having the safety divers carry two second stages would be a safer and more practical approach than buddy breathing {{in the event of an}} emergency. The medium pressure hose on the octopus is usually longer than the medium pressure hose on the primary demand valve that the diver uses, and the demand valve and/or hose may be colored yellow to aid in locating in an emergency. The secondary regulator should be clipped to the diver's harness in a position where it can be easily seen and reached by both the diver and the potential sharer of air. The longer hose is used for convenience when sharing <b>air,</b> <b>so</b> that the divers are not forced to stay in an awkward position relative to each other. Technical divers frequently extend this feature and use a 5-foot or 7-foot hose, which allows divers to swim in single file while sharing air, which may be necessary in restricted spaces inside wrecks or caves.|$|E
