50|$|The Miss Slovensko {{beauty pageant}} {{begins with a}} media {{campaign}} to announce the annual contest process. The application forms are published in selected print media for several weeks running and must be submitted by applicants with a photo showing both face and body to the FORZA Production House. Potential contestants must: be single, have no children, be {{a citizen of the}} Slovak Republic, be over 170 cm tall and {{on the day of the}} contest finale, they must be between the ages of 18 and 24. On the basis of these criteria, the girls are divided into regional casting sections. Each year, finalists go through a complex preparation process for the beauty contest. In addition to individual work, preparation includes two, week-long training sessions. These two sessions are devoted primarily to choreography and voice training for the girls. For these girls who are competing to be the most beautiful Slovak woman, the most interesting part is working with renowned experts in cosmetics, make-up, and hair styling. In the end, every detail can play a role in the beauty pageant itself. During this preparatory period, contestants go through their first costume and <b>accessory</b> <b>fittings,</b> rehearsals of choreography for the final evening and work with a speech and diction coach. The climax of the annual MISS Slovakia contest is the grand finale shown live on TV JOJ. Each year, finalists’ rewards include contracts with an agency, automobiles, exotic vacations and eventual nomination to prestigious international beauty contests, such as Miss World, Miss International, and Miss Europe.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1666, the new Chapel and Library were complete, fitted up, and in use by the College, {{and from}} now onwards very little change in the fabric itself is recorded. Various <b>accessories</b> and <b>fittings</b> have, however, been added by the College, or by various donors from time to time. The first of these was an {{extremely}} fine brass eagle, which now {{stands in the middle}} of the floor, given by Thomas Lee Dummer of Swatheling, Hants, in 1731. It is commemorated in an inscription on the globe on which the eagle stands, with Dummer's coat of arms and motto. It seems to have taken three days to fix, and stood on a stone slab 9 feet square. It was sent to London in 1734, possibly to be engraved, and on its return some new ironwork was put to the [...] "aegle", and four men employed to fix it.|$|R
5000|$|In its {{earliest}} sense, the word artillery referred to {{any group of}} soldiers primarily armed with some form of manufactured weapon or armour. Since the introduction of gunpowder and cannon, the word [...] "artillery" [...] has largely meant cannon, and in contemporary usage, it usually refers to shell-firing guns, howitzers, mortars, rockets and guided missiles. In common speech, the word artillery {{is often used to}} refer to individual devices, along with their <b>accessories</b> and <b>fittings,</b> although these assemblages are more properly called [...] "equipments". However, there is no generally recognised generic term for a gun, howitzer, mortar, and so forth: the United States uses [...] "artillery piece", but most English-speaking armies use [...] "gun" [...] and [...] "mortar". The projectiles fired are typically either [...] "shot" [...] (if solid) or [...] "shell" [...] (if not). [...] "Shell" [...] is a widely used generic term for a projectile, which is a component of munitions.|$|R
50|$|The {{outbreak}} {{of war in}} 1914 led to the capture of markets around the world previously held by the German competition. By 1915 new War Office contracts for aeroplane accessories, lighting sets etc. and munitions required the speedy erection of a new freehold factory. The new factory, known as Cricklewood Works, was built at Cricklewood, north London. In 1921 Great Portland Street activities were moved to Cricklewood following 1920's purchase of the former Metallurgique works alongside their Cricklewood Works. Post World War I their <b>accessories</b> became standard <b>fittings</b> in new cars all provided by the manufacturer.|$|R
40|$|Alloy {{wheels are}} {{automobile}} wheels {{which are made}} from an alloy of aluminum or magnesium metals Or sometimes a mixture of both. Alloy wheels differ from normal steel wheels because of their lighter weight, which improves the steering and {{the speed of the}} car. Alloy wheels will reduce the unstrung weight of a vehicle compared to one fitted with standard steel wheels. The benefit of reduced unstrung weight is more precise steering as well as a nominal reduction in fuel consumption. Alloy is an excellent conductor of heat, improving heat dissipation from the brakes, reducing the risk of brake failure under demanding driving conditions. At present four wheeler wheels are made of Aluminum Alloys. In this project, Aluminum alloy are comparing with other Alloy. In this project a parametric model is designed for Alloy wheel used in four wheeler by collecting data from reverse engineering process from existing model. Design is evaluated by analyzing the model by taking the constraints as ultimate stresses and variables as two different alloy materials and different loads and goals as maximum outer diameter of the wheel and <b>fitting</b> <b>accessories</b> areas like shaft of the axle and bolts PCD of the car.
