60|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> off I {{found myself}} alone with Mrs. Cooke's niece {{on the seat}} behind.|$|E
60|$|Benjamin {{looked a}} little sadly at my flushed face <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> to Major Fitz-David's house.|$|E
60|$|The first {{question}} that I put, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> {{from the station}} to the house, related naturally to her father.|$|E
60|$|They stood very shamefaced. George clicked to the mare, and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> started threw coppers to the boys. While <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> away I {{watched the}} little group {{diminish}} down the road.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>drove</b> on in {{the same}} {{direction}} <b>as</b> before. When <b>we</b> had started he turned to me.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>drove</b> off {{ten minutes}} later. I {{looked out of}} the motor <b>as</b> <b>we</b> swung round into the main thoroughfare. Behind {{the window of the}} little sitting room I saw the pale, almost ghastly face of Lord Porthoning. He caught my eye and waved his hand weakly.|$|R
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> {{through the}} village, I remembered that I wanted some stamps, so {{accordingly}} {{we pulled up}} at the post office.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are the Dedlocks down here, Lawrence?" [...] said my {{guardian}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> {{along and}} Mr. Boythorn trotted {{on the green}} turf by the roadside.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] remarked my friend, {{with a quiet}} chuckle, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> along; [...] "I {{expected}} as much. Black Jack is in a bad humour to-day." ...|$|E
60|$|That was the beginning. For {{three weeks}} this strange affection of Davidson's eyes {{continued}} unabated. It was {{far worse than}} being blind. He was absolutely helpless, {{and had to be}} fed like a newly-hatched bird, and led about and undressed. If he attempted to move he fell over things or stuck himself against walls or doors. After a day or so he got used to hearing our voices without seeing us, and willingly admitted he was at home, and that Wade was right in what he told him. My sister, to whom he was engaged, insisted on coming to see him, and would sit for hours every day while he talked about this beach of his. Holding her hand seemed to comfort him immensely. He explained that when we left the College and drove home--he lived in Hampstead village--it appeared to him <b>as</b> if <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> right through a sandhill--it was perfectly black until he emerged again--and through rocks and trees and solid obstacles, and when he was taken to his own room it made him giddy and almost frantic with the fear of falling, because going upstairs seemed to lift him thirty or forty feet above the rocks of his imaginary island. He kept saying he should smash all the eggs. The end was that he had to be taken down into his father's consulting room and laid upon a couch that stood there.|$|R
5000|$|... non-separable: Wir umfuhren den Fußgänger. <b>We</b> <b>drove</b> {{around the}} pedestrian.|$|R
5000|$|... separable: Wir fuhren den Fußgänger um. <b>We</b> <b>drove</b> {{over the}} pedestrian.|$|R
6000|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> away {{through the}} shadow, [...] The candle she {{held in the}} door From rain-varnished tree-trunk to tree-trunk [...] Flashed fainter, and flashed no more;-- ...|$|E
60|$|Obediently she {{followed}} {{me from the}} room, and down the ladder. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> away from the grounds she threw her arms about my neck and sobbed pitifully.|$|E
6000|$|We {{spoke of}} French acting and actors, [...] And their easy, natural way: Of the weather, {{for it was}} raining, [...] <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> home from the play.|$|E
60|$|He {{brought us}} out some galettes, {{as they call}} them, and each of us sisters had a draught of wine, which did {{us a great deal}} of good. Then <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> on in the dark <b>as</b> fast <b>as</b> <b>we</b> could, for the Coadjutor's {{carriage}} had passed us while we were halting, and we wanted to enter the gates at the same time with him.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>drove</b> with us six {{or seven}} cows for food; but our negroes knew nothing of curing the flesh by salting and drying it till we showed them the way, {{and then they were}} mighty willing to do so <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>we</b> had any salt to do it with, and to carry salt a great way too, after we found we should have no more.|$|R
60|$|I was {{punctual}} to my appointment. <b>We</b> <b>drove</b> {{together to}} the asylum.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Master," [...] said Bes to me <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> to the palace, [...] "I almost {{wish that}} we were back in another chariot hunting lions in the East." ...|$|E
60|$|Basil {{scarcely}} {{said a word}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> across Westminster Bridge, through Trafalgar Square, along Piccadilly, and up the Uxbridge Road. Only as he {{was opening}} the gate he spoke.|$|E
60|$|No sooner {{said than}} done. We jumped again into our cab and started. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> back, Mr. Hayes asked me where I {{thought we were}} most likely to find it.|$|E
5000|$|... 60 Years Behind the Wheel: Cars <b>We</b> <b>Drove</b> in Canada, 1900-1960 - 2003 ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>drove</b> <b>as</b> far as Yair with Mr. and Mrs. Theobald. The lady read after dinner--and read well.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>drove</b> {{off down}} the avenue in {{complete}} silence. When we had turned the corner Eve gave a little sigh.|$|R
60|$|He {{accompanied}} {{me all the}} way to the hotel. He {{asked for}} no explanation, nor did I volunteer any. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> into the Place Vendome, however, he leaned towards me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do we concern {{ourselves}} in the matter at all?" [...] I asked <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> off. [...] "I don't see why we can't leave the lawyers to do this final settlement." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The word 'good-bye,'" [...] I {{remarked to}} Clara, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> away, [...] "is always a painful one. Oddly enough when I was hunting the humpo, or humped buffalo, of the Himalayas----" ...|$|E
60|$|Late in {{the evening}} (too late for little Rosebud) <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> homeward. The streets of old Siena looked very grim at night, {{and it seemed like}} gazing into caverns to glimpse down some of the side streets <b>as</b> <b>we</b> passed, with a light burning dimly at the end of them. It was after ten when we reached home, and climbed up our gloomy staircase, lighted by the glimmer of some wax moccoli which I had in my pocket.|$|R
60|$|The {{direction}} in which <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> took us (<b>as</b> well as I could judge) toward the great northern suburb of London.|$|R
60|$|At the {{appointed}} hour <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> out three miles, and {{assembled in the}} handsome garden {{in front of the}} Emperor's palace.|$|R
60|$|This {{concession}} {{was received}} by poor Guert with profound gratitude; and he assured me, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> back to town, {{that he had}} not felt so happy for the last two months.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{heard about}} the first business, but not about this matter of the jewels; except that {{he gave me a}} slight outline <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> here this morning. It is a curious business.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was horrified}} for I had heard nothing of his illness. I need {{not say that}} I rushed for my coat and my hat. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> back I asked for the details.|$|E
6000|$|... "You think me changed some {{since that}} morning <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> {{together}} to Holland House--do {{you remember it}} after the night at St. Stephen's?" ...|$|R
60|$|That {{the country}} was teeming with game soon became apparent, for ever and anon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> {{advanced}} a herd of gnus or buffaloes or hartbeests would dart affrighted from their cover, and sweep over the open ground into another place of shelter, out of which they were again driven as the line advanced. In the course of half an hour <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> out hartbeests, zebras, gnus, buffaloes, giraffes, rhinoceroses, and many other kinds of smaller game, either singly or in herds.|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>drove</b> away, out of town, to {{the churchyard}} at Hornsey. 'Better {{here than in}} the streets,' said my aunt. 'He was born here.' ...|$|R
