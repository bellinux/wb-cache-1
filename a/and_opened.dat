40|$|AbstractThis paper empirically {{investigates the}} impact of trading {{activity}} including trading volume <b>and</b> <b>open</b> interest on price volatility in Asian futures exchanges. Trading volume <b>and</b> <b>open</b> interest represent market information for investors. This study uses three different definitions of volatility: (1) daily volatility measured by close-to-close returns, (2) non-trading volatility measured by close-to-open returns, and (3) trading volatility measured by open-to-close returns. The impact of trading volume <b>and</b> <b>open</b> interest on price volatility is investigated. Following Bessembinder and Seguin (1993), volume <b>and</b> <b>open</b> interest are divided into expected and unexpected components. The GARCH (1, 1) model is employed using expected and unexpected components of trading activity (volume <b>and</b> <b>open</b> interest) as explanatory variables. The results show a positive contemporaneous relationship between expected and unexpected trading volume <b>and</b> volatility, while <b>open</b> interest mitigates volatility. Policy makers can use these findings to suggest to investors that trading activity (volume <b>and</b> <b>open</b> interest) is a proxy of market information flowing to exchanges, especially unexpected trading activity. New information flowing to exchanges can mostly be noticed in unexpected trading volumes <b>and</b> <b>open</b> interests...|$|R
