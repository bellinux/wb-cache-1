5|$|During World War I {{the salon}} became {{a haven for}} those opposed to the war. Henri Barbusse once gave <b>a</b> <b>reading</b> from his anti-war novel Under Fire and Barney hosted a Women's Congress for Peace at the Rue Jacob.

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>Read</b> For Ownership (RFO) is an {{operation}} in cache coherency protocols that combines <b>a</b> <b>read</b> and <b>an</b> invalidate broadcast. The operation is issued by a processor {{trying to write}} into a cache line {{that is in the}} shared (S) or invalid (I) states of the MESI protocol. The operation causes all other cache to set the state of such a line to I. <b>A</b> <b>read</b> for ownership transaction is <b>a</b> <b>read</b> operation with intent to write to that memory address. Therefore, this operation is exclusive. It brings data to the cache and invalidates all other processor caches which hold this memory line.|$|R

5|$|According to Taum, {{the title}} Belenggu {{reflects}} the inner conflicts {{the main characters}} face that limit their actions. Taum points to {{the climax of the}} novel– in which Rohayah refuses to marry Sukartono because if she were to marry him he would lose face because of her past– as a prime example of these limitations. Siregar notes that such <b>a</b> <b>reading</b> is supported by dialogue between Hartono and Sukartono, in which they note that humans are inherently held back by their reminiscences of the past.|$|E

5|$|By 1845, the {{population}} was 6,475. In 1846, there were useful roads to many communities as well as stage coaches and steamboats to Toronto, Queenston, and Niagara. Eleven cargo schooners were owned in Hamilton. Eleven churches were in operation. <b>A</b> <b>reading</b> room provided access to newspapers from other cities and from England and the U.S. In addition to stores of all types, four banks, tradesmen of various types, and sixty-five taverns, industry in the community included three breweries, ten importers of dry goods and groceries, five importers of hardware, two tanneries, three coachmakers, and a marble and a stone works.|$|E
5|$|Hess died on 17 August 1987 {{at the age}} of 93 in {{a summer}} house that had been set up in the prison garden as <b>a</b> <b>reading</b> room. He took an {{extension}} cord from one of the lamps, strung it over a window latch, and hanged himself. Death occurred by asphyxiation. A short note to his family, thanking them for all they had done, was found in his pocket. The Four Powers released a statement on 17 September ruling the death a suicide. Initially buried at a secret location to avoid media attention or demonstrations by Nazi sympathisers, Hess was re-interred in a family plot at Wunsiedel on 17 March 1988, and his wife was buried beside him when she died in 1995. Spandau Prison was demolished to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.|$|E
30|$|Unlike <b>a</b> {{synchronous}} <b>read</b> plan, {{which is}} a loop, <b>an</b> asynchronous <b>read</b> plan uses <b>a</b> <b>read</b> listener that stores tag information as soon as <b>a</b> <b>read</b> object occurs. In other words, the computer is always “listening” for tag <b>reads,</b> and once <b>a</b> reader picks up <b>a</b> tag <b>read,</b> the tag data is immediately stored, i.e., each reader is continuously reading. Note that, although the readers are reading continuously, {{there may be a}} lag in data storage if multiple readers are reading simultaneously, but the time of the lag is negligible. There are multiple benefits of using asynchronous reading including utilizing multiple readers/antennas simultaneously, reading multiple tags per reader/antenna, and not having to miss tags from readers/antennas being dormant.|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} {{approaches to}} enforcing serial=abA~ty are the &Jo-phabe ~o&tng technique and the timedtip Ohd&i. ng technique Either approach requires that <b>a</b> <b>read</b> operation from <b>a</b> transaction be heg+titied (in {{the form of}} either <b>a</b> <b>read</b> tzmestamp or <b>a</b> <b>read</b> lock), so that a write operation from a concurrent transaction will not interfere improperly with the read operation. However, setting a lock or leaving a timestamp with a data element is an expensive operation The {{purpose of the current}} research is to seek ways to reduce the overhead of synchronixlng certain types of read accesses while achieving the goal of serializability...|$|R

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the College Walk festivities {{is one of}} Columbia's older holiday traditions, the lighting of the Yule Log. The Christmas ceremony dates to a period prior to the American Revolutionary War, but lapsed before being revived by University President Nicholas Murray Butler in the early 20th century. A troop of students dressed as Continental Army soldiers carry the eponymous log from the sun-dial to the lounge of John Jay Hall, where it is lit amid the singing of seasonal carols. The Christmas ceremony is accompanied by <b>a</b> <b>reading</b> of A Visit From St. Nicholas by Clement Clarke Moore and Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus by Francis Pharcellus Church.|$|E

5|$|Oscar Wilde, a {{critical}} study by Arthur Ransome {{was published in}} 1912. The book only briefly mentioned Wilde's life, but subsequently Ransome (and The Times Book Club) were sued for libel by Lord Alfred Douglas. The trial in April 1913 was in a way a re-run of the trials of Oscar Wilde. The trial resulted from Douglas's rivalry with Robbie Ross for Wilde (and his need of money).

5|$|Reich {{first met}} Sigmund Freud in 1919 {{when he asked}} Freud for <b>a</b> <b>reading</b> list for a seminar {{concerning}} sexology. It seems they left a strong impression on each other. Freud allowed him to start meeting with analytic patients in September that year, although Reich was just 22 years old and still an undergraduate, which gave him a small income. He was accepted as a guest member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Association, becoming a regular member in October 1920, and began his own analysis with Isidor Sadger. He lived and worked out of an apartment on Berggasse 7, the street on which Freud lived at no. 19, in the Alsergrund area of Vienna.|$|E
