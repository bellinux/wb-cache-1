These well-known facts imply that binocular convergence in visual cortex can explain our cyclopean view of the world. To test the adequacy of this assumption, we examined how human subjects integrate binocular events in time. Light flashes presented synchronously to both eyes were compared to flashes presented alternately (asynchronously) to one eye and then the other.

Temporal information can indicate whether stimuli in different senses are related or not. A recent human fMRI study (Noesselt et al.

A region of superior temporal sulcus (STS) showed higher BOLD signal for the synchronous condition. But {{this could not}} be related to performance, and it remained unclear if the erratic, unpredictable nature of the stimulus trains was important. Here we compared synchronous audiovisual <b>trains</b> to <b>asynchronous</b> <b>trains,</b> while using a behavioral task requiring detection of higher-intensity target events in either modality. We further varied whether the stimulus trains had predictable temporal pattern or not. Synchrony (versus lag) between auditory and visual trains enhanced behavioral sensitivity (d') to intensity targets in either modality, regardless of predictable versus unpredictable patterning. The analogous contrast in fMRI revealed BOLD increases in several brain areas, including the left STS region reported by Noesselt et al. [2007 : J Neurosci 27 : 11431 - 11441]. The synchrony effect on BOLD here correlated with the subject-by-subject impact on performance.

40|$|Introduction: Asynchronous online {{training}} {{has become an}} increasingly popular educational format in the new era of technology-based professional development. We sought to evaluate the impact of an online <b>asynchronous</b> <b>training</b> module {{on the ability of}} medical students and emergency medicine (EM) residents to detect electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI).   Methods: We developed an online ECG training and testing module on AMI, with emphasis on recognizing ST elevation myocardial infarction (MI) and early activation of cardiac catheterization resources. Study participants included senior medical students and EM residents at all post-graduate levels rotating in our emergency department (ED). Participants were given a baseline set of ECGs for interpretation. This was followed by a brief interactive {{online training}} module on normal ECGs as well as abnormal ECGs representing an acute MI. Participants then underwent a post-test with a set of ECGs in which they had to interpret and decide appropriate intervention including catheterization lab activation.   Results: 148 students and 35 EM residents participated in this training in the 2012 - 2013 academic year. Students and EM residents showed significant improvements in recognizing ECG abnormalities after taking the asynchronous online training module. The mean score on the testing module for students improved from 5. 9 (95 % CI [5. 7 - 6. 1]) to 7. 3 (95 % CI [7. 1 - 7. 5]), with a mean difference of 1. 4 (95 % CI [1. 12 - 1. 68]) (p< 0. 0001).

Conclusion: An online interactive module of training improved the ability of medical students and EM residents to correctly recognize the ECG evidence of an acute MI.

40|$|Objective – To {{establish}} the preferred modality for professional continuing education (CE) {{among members of}} three library associations. The primary hypothesis was that face-to-face training is the preferred modality, and the secondary hypothesis was that younger librarians {{are more likely to}} favour online or blended training modalities. In addition, the authors sought to investigate which factors influence participants’ decisions to take up training. Design – Online questionnaire. Setting – Three library associations based in the United States of America. These were the American Library Association (ALA), the Special Libraries Association (SLA), and the Medical Library Association (MLA). Subjects – A random sample of 328 members of the ALA (86 participants), SLA (63 participants), and MLA (291 participants). Some participants were members of more than one association. Methods – Participants were recruited to complete an online survey via direct e-mail contact (MLA), messages on email discussion lists (SLA) and social networks (ALA). The survey asked about participants’ experience of, and preference for, five different training modalities for CE. These were: face-to-face (classroom instruction), web-based synchronous (with real-time participant-instructor interaction), web-based asynchronous (with instructor involvement, but not in real time), blended (a combination of different modalities), and webcasts (live online presentations with limited participant-instructor interaction). Participants were then asked to rank factors which would influence their decision to undertake CE courses. The factors were cost, opportunity to socialize/network, time away from work, learning at their own pace, and having immediate access to either the class instructor or other participants. Participants were also given space to comment on both CE modalities and influencing factors. Main Results – There was a statistically significant preference for face-to-face instruction in this sample, being preferred by at least 73. 1 % of participants in all age ranges. Younger librarians did not display a preference for online or blended training modalities. There was a significant difference in second preference between ALA and MLA members, who both preferred Web based <b>asynchronous</b> <b>training,</b> and SLA members, who preferred the web-based synchronous format. Participants’ preferences for all modalities apart from face to face were significantly different depending on whether or not they had experienced the particular modality. Cost was ranked as the most influential factor in the decision to undertake CE by members of all three library associations (significant at P Conclusion – The results confirm the hypothesis that face to face is the preferred training modality for this sample of members of the ALA, MLA and SLA. However, the secondary hypothesis, that younger librarians are more likely to prefer online or blended training methods was disproved in this sample. Since this is the case, and there is a strong influence of cost on the uptake of CE courses, the authors suggest that providers of CE should consider these results when planning training to suit the needs of their members...|$|E

A field experiment was conducted adapting the three methods to an online asynchronous environment, and including a face-to-face behavior-modeling control condition. Results indicate that when conducting software training, it may be almost as effective to use an online asynchronous behaviormodeling method as it is to use a more costly face-to-face behavior-modeling method.

This algorithm would recognize the presence of such a signal only if all i-received pulse powers exceeded a threshold T(i) : these thresholds were selected to achieve a desired false alarm rate, independent of i. To simplify the analysis, {{it was assumed that}} the pulses were synchronous with the spectrum sample times.

We already see the limitations of existing algorithms for models that exploit structured input via complex and instance-dependent control flow, which prohibits minibatching. We present an <b>asynchronous</b> model-parallel (AMP) <b>training</b> algorithm that is specifically motivated by training on networks of interconnected devices. Through an implementation on multi-core CPUs, we show that AMP training converges to the same accuracy as conventional synchronous training algorithms in a similar number of epochs, but utilizes the available hardware more efficiently even for small minibatch sizes, resulting in significantly shorter overall training times. Our framework opens the door for scaling up a new class of deep learning models that cannot be efficiently trained today. Comment: 17 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
