The {{core of the}} sculpture was carved from {{a single piece of}} wood, most likely from a poplar tree, though earlier art historians have assumed it to be pear, plum or lime. The sculpture’s surface is entirely covered with sheets of gold leaf less than 0.25 millimetres (0.01in) thick, which are held in place by minute golden bolts. The size of the individual gold leaves varies to suit the surface texture. The faces of both mother and child are pounded out of one single leaf each. The coloured eyes of the figures are made of cloisonné enamel. While the eyes of the mother are inset into carved fittings, those of the child are merely pasted on the wooden core. The child’s hand is made of cast silver and was added only in the 14th century; the original right hand is lost. There are traces of original tenth century adornments on the orb in the Virgin's right hand, on the right back leg of the stool, {{as well as on the}} child's book and halo. The <b>agrafe</b> showing an eagle and seemingly pinning Mary’s cloak is an early thirteenth century addition; the fibula beneath has Gothic features and is dated to the fourteenth century.|$|E

Os métodos de estabilizaçao disponíveis sao: Fios de Kirschner, Parafusos Corticais, Placas e parafusos e <b>Agrafe.</b> A estabilidade oferecida e a técnica cirúrgica utilizada para cada {{material}} é discutida na literatura. OBJETIVO: Comparar a força de compressão e a estabilidade biomecânica da fixação da articulação tarsometatársica com Parafusos Corticais e com <b>Agrafe.</b> CASUISTICA E MÉTODO: Selecionados 10 cadáveres frescos, do genero masculino, idade variando de 35 a 49 anos, foram submetidas a dissecçao do cúboide e do 4 ° metatarso bilateralmente, decorticadas as superfícies articulares e realizada fixação com parafuso cortical - Cortical Screw 3. 5 mm Impol, e <b>Agrafe</b> - Uni-clip® Staple 2. 0 NewDeal. RESULTADOS: Os 20 ensaios biomecânicos foram completados. A analise estatística dos métodos <b>agrafe</b> vs parafuso cortical, em relação a energia acumulada até atingir o pico de força do ensaio p= 0. 047, e a energia acumulada até o final do ensaio p= 0. 047 apresentaram diferença significativa. CONCLUSÃO: Os picos de carga suportados pelas estabilizaçoes com <b>agrafe</b> e com parafuso cortical decrescem, significativamente, com a idade. Observa-se valores de força superiores para o <b>agrafe</b> em ossos osteoporóticos. A energia acumulada na area de trabalho dos graficos nos ensaios com o <b>agrafe,</b> mostram-se estatisticamente superiores aos valores para os Parafusos Corticais. INTRODUCTION: Tarsometatarsal arthrodeses are {{an effective}} therapeutic alternative for treating symptomatic osteoarthroses of the Lisfranc joint. Stabilization methods available include: Kirschner's wires, cortical screws, plates and screws and staples. The stability provided and the surgical technique employed with each material {{is discussed in}} literature. PURPOSE: To compare compression forces and biomechanical stability of tarsometatarsal joint fixation with cortical screws and staples. CASE SERIES AND METHOD: Ten fresh male cadavers with ages ranging from 35 to 49 years were selected and submitted to bilateral dissection of the cuboidal and 4 th metatarsal bones, with joint surfaces decortification and fixation with cortical screw - Cortical Screw 3. 5 mm Impol, and Uni-clip® Staple 2. 0 NewDeal. RESULTS: All the 20 biomechanical assays were completed. The statistical analysis of the methods using staples vs. cortical screw concerning accrued energy until reaching the assay's peak force p= 0. 047, and the accrued energy until {{the completion of the}} assay p= 0. 047 showed a significant difference. CONCLUSION: Load peaks supported by staples and cortical screws are significantly reduced with age. Superior force values are found for staples in osteoporotic bones. The accrued energy on graphs' work areas in assays with staples is shown to be statistically superior to cortical screws' values...|$|E
