5|$|Most World War I war {{designers}} {{attempted to}} produce memorials that were, as cultural historian Jay Winter describes, noble, uplifting, tragic and endurably sad. There were various architectural styles used on memorials, {{but most were}} essentially conservative in nature, typically embracing well established styles such as classicism and embracing mainstream Christian symbolism. This conservatism in part resulted from the age and background of the committees that were commissioning the memorials, and also from <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> established architectural styles, rather a potentially more transitory but fashionable style, would be more enduring and appropriate.|$|E
5|$|The {{entire day}} of a Jain monk is spent in {{ensuring}} that he observes his vow of ahimsa through mind, body and speech faultlessly. This seemingly extreme behaviour of the monks comes from <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> every action, no matter however subtle, has a karmic effect which can bind soul and inhibit liberation, especially those that result in hiṃsā (injury).|$|E
5|$|Ambohimanga {{has been}} viewed by many Merina since the late 19th century as the {{embodiment}} of an ideal social order blessed by the ancestors. The significance attached to the site in Imerina increased further when its sister rova in Antananarivo was destroyed by fire in 1995, contributing to <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> Ambohimanga was the last remaining physical link to this sanctified past. A small intellectual elite among the Tsimahafotsy clan of Ambohimanga and the nobles (andriana) believe that only Ambohimanga possesses the ancestral benediction (hasina) to serve as the national capital and imbue national leaders with the legitimacy and wisdom needed to rightly govern the country. The descendents of the andriana have consequently been key in promoting and protecting Ambohimanga, such as by playing a significant role in successfully lobbying UNESCO to list Ambohimanga as a World Heritage Site.|$|E

5|$|Falling attendances {{due to the}} {{commercial}} nature of the district, and also <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> there was some redundancy of provision given the nearby St Matthew's Church, caused the Manchester diocese to review the status of St John's and its parish in the 1920s. Following an internal review and a public consultation, in 1927 it was formally proposed that the two parishes should be merged as St Matthew's parish. The diocese preferred to retain St Matthew's and demolish St John's, {{at least in part}} because the former was a more recent construction. This was a reversal of a proposal made in 1919, when the predominantly transient Roman Catholic population of the St Matthew's parish was given as a reason to merge it into St John's.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the {{outbreak}} of the First World War the NUWSS spent its time in north Wales organising educational and propaganda campaigns. In south Wales friction was caused by a shift in political views pushed onto the country from the central office. 1912 saw the NUWSS switch its policy as a non-party organisation to set up the Election Fighting Fund (EFF) to support the newly burgeoning Labour Party. Wales had traditionally been a Liberal heartland and the South Wales Federation of Women’s Suffrage Societies was opposed to this new policy. There was <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> there was a disjoint between the central 'English feminist agenda' pushed by the militant headquarters and the needs of Welsh social, cultural and political views. The strains existed between the two organisation until the EFF was abandoned in 1914.|$|E
5|$|Islam has {{a strong}} {{tradition}} of aniconism, and it is considered highly blasphemous in most Islamic traditions to visually depict Muhammad. This, compounded with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the cartoons insulted Muhammad and Islam, offended many Muslims. Danish Muslim organisations that objected to the depictions responded by petitioning the embassies of Islamic countries and the Danish government to take action in response, and filed a judicial complaint against the newspaper, which was dismissed in January 2006. After the Danish government refused to meet with diplomatic representatives of the Muslim countries and would not intervene in the case, a number of Danish imams visited the Middle East in late 2005 {{to raise awareness of}} the issue. They presented a dossier containing the twelve cartoons from the Jyllands-Posten, and other information some of which was found to be falsified.|$|E

5|$|Though {{similar in}} their {{formation}} process, oil shales differ from coals in several distinct ways. The precursors {{of the organic}} matter in oil shale and coal differ in <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> oil shale is of algal origin, but may also include remains of vascular land plants that more commonly compose much of the organic matter in coal. The origin {{of some of the}} organic matter in oil shale is obscure {{because of the lack of}} recognizable biologic structures that would help identify the precursor organisms. Such materials may be of bacterial origin or the product of bacterial degradation of algae or other organic matter.|$|E

25|$|Adults with C-PTSD have {{sometimes}} experienced prolonged interpersonal traumatization as {{children as well}} as prolonged trauma as adults. This early injury interrupts the development of a robust sense of self and of others. Because physical and emotional pain or neglect was often inflicted by attachment figures such as caregivers or older siblings, these individuals may develop <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> they are fundamentally flawed and that others cannot be relied upon.|$|E
25|$|The average Boer {{nevertheless}} was not thirsty for war. Many did {{not look}} forward to fighting against fellow Christians and, by and large, fellow Christian Protestants. Many may have had an overly optimistic {{sense of what the}} war would involve, imagining that victory could be won as easily as in the First South African War. Many, including many generals, also had <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> their cause was holy and just, and blessed by God.|$|E
25|$|David Kronke, The Daily News of Los Angeles (April 22, 2001) — Nero Wolfe, alas, is {{undone by}} uneven {{performances}} and <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> it's more witty and urbane {{than it really}} is. Hutton is too antic — {{he seems to be}} playing the sassy newsroom copy boy in a '30s B-picture — and his narration tries far too hard to push jokes that just aren't funny. Maury Chaykin, a normally reliable character actor, is alternately flat or rudderlessly blustery as Wolfe.|$|E

Even when consciousness is impaired, insight into the hallucination or illusion is typically preserved.|$|E
25|$|The bond measure {{ultimately}} failed, {{due in part}} to <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> Portland {{could not}} attract a major sports franchise. The Oregonian noted that the Veterans Memorial Coliseum, which was opened five years before, was hemorrhaging money without a permanent tenant. Another issue raised was the traffic on Interstate 5, which opponents said would get worse if the stadium was erected. As with several civic works projects, opposition grew around the possibility that tax would increase. Worries of flood damage was another concern, since it was in the area that flooded two decades prior.|$|E
25|$|Derbforgaill is chiefly {{remembered for}} her {{abduction}} by Diarmait Mac Murchada, king of Laigin (Leinster) in 1152, a supposed {{catalyst for the}} late twelfth-century English invasion of Ireland. Her abduction occurred {{within the context of}} a joint military effort against her husband by Tairdelbach Ua Conchobair (king of Ireland) and Mac Murchada. The surviving Irish annalistic accounts differ from one another in some of their details, but more significantly they stand apart from later English sources in that they do not compress the events of the 1150s and 1160s to create <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> Derbforgaill’s abduction played a direct and immediate part in Mac Murchada’s banishment and his subsequent enlisting English help.|$|E
