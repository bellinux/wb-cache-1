500|$|In {{the context}} of the film, [...] "Listen" [...] is a 1975 song that Deena records on Rainbow Records, a {{recording}} empire established by Curtis. [...] She is actually recording the song in a booth as a track, but the song also reveals Deena's growing disgust at being considered merely Curtis' property. Used in the film as a last-minute recording by Deena before leaving Curtis [...] "to find her own voice as a newly independent woman", co-writer Anne Preven called [...] "Listen" [...] a song which [...] "Deena is exclaiming, 'You don't know who I am, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> do.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Lieutenant Lillian Pimlott {{wrote to}} her mother, after being {{deployed}} to Pearl Harbor, and said, [...] "I {{was fascinated by the}} ships which are making history in every battle. I've talked to seamen and I've met flyers-from Iwo (Iwo Jima), from Okinawa, heroes from every encounter. I know now what war means and {{my heart goes out to}} every one of them. Among them I am making, I hope, life long friends, for their experiences mean everything to my self-satisfaction... As long as they fight on, I have no desire to return home, for I feel I belong here... I have learned much in these brief three months about life and living. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> have already changed in many ways and many viewpoints...

500|$|To {{prepare for}} the part of Blair, actress Leighton Meester, a natural blonde, dyed her hair brown before auditioning, and also studied the first novel. She has {{described}} the character as multi-faceted, labeling her [...] "a {{little bit of everything}} which is pretty amazing." [...] Like von Ziegesar, Meester has also claimed to relate to Blair on certain levels. Prior to the show's debut in 2007, the actress stated that, [...] "The only way to play Blair, or any character, and make her human, is to find what she is inside me. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> have my insecurities, too." [...] She went on to say that, [...] "The way Blair and I are not alike when it comes to insecurities is: She pays so much attention to hers!" [...] Meester's casting was described by Yahoo! as a star-making role which moved her [...] "into the pop culture vanguard," [...] while Cecily von Ziegesar has called her a perfect choice.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2012, Michael Portillo backed Gove to be {{a serious}} {{contender}} in a future race for the Conservative leadership, though Gove had said in an interview a few months before that [...] "I'm constitutionally incapable of it. There's a special extra quality you need that is indefinable, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> don't have it. There's an equanimity, an impermeability and a courage that you need. There are some things in life you know it's better not to try." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Wall Street Journal said, [...] "The WB's One Tree Hill, a slick prime-time {{drama about}} a small town packed with hunky {{teenagers}} and simmering family secrets, {{is one of the}} fastest-growing shows on network television." [...] The Star-Ledger commented, [...] "One Tree Hill is a welcome surprise... Every choice it makes from pacing to photography to music seems just about right, and the casting is inspired." [...] Alynda Wheat of Entertainment Weekly called the show a [...] "guilty pleasure" [...] and said they had not had one [...] "this guilty" [...] since Melrose Place. [...] "Their relationships change so quickly you'd need a spreadsheet to keep up," [...] she stated. [...] "As Brooke put it to Peyton, 'I think Nathan likes Tutor Girl, but I think Tutor Girl likes Lucas. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> like Lucas, and I don't know who the hell you like anymore. However, Wheat criticized the lack of parents in most of the teenage characters' lives. [...] "Any time order threatens to reign, the writers ship out the parents – to Italy, a boating accident, whatever," [...] said Wheat. Daniel Fienberg of zap2it.com said that, though the show has all the elements that make for a good show about teenagers/young adults, [...] "it's also a show that has stubbornly refused to be categorized merely as a guilty pleasure and its myriad artistic pretensions – Lucas's Bartlett's Familiar Quotations-spewing narration, Peyton's (Hilarie Burton) pedantic lectures on indie rock, countless expositional monologues lifted from a Philosophy 101 lecture—have often rendered it merely bad, rather than so-bad-its-good". Fienberg did, however, compliment the school shooting episode. Cynthia Boris of DVDVerdict.com, on the other hand, said, [...] "One Tree Hill doesn't claim to be anything more than it is. They acknowledge that they're a teen fantasy complete with an appropriately emo WB soundtrack." ...|$|E
