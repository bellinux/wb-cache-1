5|$|In normal untransformed cells, EFS {{acts as a}} SRC family kinase {{substrate}} in neurite outgrowth, {{a process}} that is dependent on activity of SRC kinases. Reciprocally, EFS activates SRC signaling through c-CRK and RAP1. Further, SRC directly phosphorylates residues Y576 and Y577 tyrosine sites on the EFS, enhancing targeting FAK, <b>and</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>the</b> solubility and/or stability of the complex. Through SRC, EFS may also negatively regulate expression of E-cadherin at adherens junctions, a function that has been reported for other CAS proteins (NEDD9 and BCAR1); however, this point has not been directly established for EFS.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to this, a nationwide lobbying effort was coordinated among astronomers.
