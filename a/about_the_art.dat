5|$|In 1879, Ulysses S. Grant, {{the former}} President of the United States, visited Japan. While in Tokyo, he {{attended}} a jujutsu presentation at Shibusawa Eiichi's home in Asukayama. Kano Jigoro {{was one of the}} jujutsuka present. At that time, jujutsu was just starting to become known in Europe and the Americas. Excepting literal circus acts, few non-Japanese had much chance of seeing or learning <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>art.</b> Even in Japan, judo and jujutsu were not considered separate disciplines at that time. Indeed, it was not until 1925 that there started to be clear differentiation of the names in Japan, and outside Japan, judo and jujutsu were not completely separated until the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{uploaded}} to The Movies Online, Lionhead's website for user-created videos, on 22 November 2005 {{and was soon}} covered by American and French press. Although real-time-rendered, three-dimensional computer animation (machinima) {{had been used in}} earlier political films, The French Democracy attained an unprecedented level of mainstream attention for political machinima. While acknowledging the film's flaws, such as the grammatically poor English subtitles, commentators praised its clear political message and compared it to films such as La Haine and Do the Right Thing. The French Democracy inspired other politically conscious machinima works and fueled discussion <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> form's potential for political expression. Some raised concerns that video game companies would use their copyrights to control the content of derivative machinima films.|$|E
5|$|Dual Destinies was {{the first}} game in the main series to be {{developed}} for the Nintendo 3DS; this move from the Nintendo DS to the Nintendo 3DS {{was the most difficult}} part of the development, with the development team being unsure of whether to use 2D graphics like with previous games or to use 3D models. Eventually they decided to use 3D graphics, because of the stereoscopic 3D effect being a selling point for the Nintendo 3DS system. Because of the move to 3D, the in-house artist Takuro Fuse was in charge of the art direction, rather than the series regular Tatsuro Iwamoto, so that they could have meetings <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> more often. This was Fuse's first work on the main series, so he initially had problems with making character designs that fit the series, and had to get a lot of feedback from Eshiro. According to Eshiro and Yamazaki, they put effort into the graphics, wanting to ensure that Dual Destinies graphics looked better than those of Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney.|$|E
40|$|Arts {{education}} {{is an important}} area of learning for young children. <b>The</b> <b>arts</b> allow children to explore and make meaning {{of the world around}} them.

5|$|Saavedro is the {{antagonist}} of Exile. Depicted as a vengeful {{and broken}} man, Saavedro is an inhabitant of the Age of Narayan, {{one of the}} Ages chosen by Atrus to try to teach his sons Sirrus and Achenar <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Art</b> of writing books linking to other worlds. Saavedro agrees to help tutor Atrus' sons, but is shocked when the brothers instigate a destructive rebellion and abandon the Age to be destroyed from within. When Saavedro pursues Sirrus and Achenar to the Age of J'nanin, he is assaulted and left for dead. Trapped on J'nanin and believing Narayan destroyed and his family to be dead, Saavedro's mental health deteriorates during his years of captivity. When Saavedro is unexpectedly freed and travels to Tomahna in hope of finding the brothers, he steals the linking book for Releeshahn in a plan to lure Atrus to Narayan and exact revenge. Once on Narayan, Saavedro discovers that his people have not been destroyed. Cornered by the Stranger, Saavedro gives up the Releeshahn book. In the game's optimal ending, the player enables Saavedro to peacefully return to Narayan, before taking Releeshahn back to Atrus. Saavedro is portrayed by veteran actor Brad Dourif, who accepted the role of Saavedro {{because he was a}} Myst fan. Dourif said that his role for the game was much more difficult than working on movie sets, as he could not see the player he was addressing or interact with the game environment.|$|E

25|$|The Model of Poesy is a Renaissance English {{treatise}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> {{of poetry}} written by William Scott in about 1599. It contains a theoretical {{description of what}} poetry is, and practical guidelines about how to write well. Scott, following on from Philip Sidney's An Apology for Poetry, develops his poetics in the classical and continental tradition, and includes examples from many English writers, including Geoffrey Chaucer, Edmund Spenser and William Shakespeare. Scott also quotes from his partial translation of Guillaume de Saluste Du Bartas' La Sepmaine that is found directly after the Model in the sole surviving manuscript copy of both texts. The Model was re-discovered in the early 2000s and printed in a modern critical edition, edited by Gavin Alexander, in 2013.|$|E

25|$|Often, if {{the skill}} {{is being used}} in a common or {{practical}} way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered commercial art instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art. Some art followers {{have argued that the}} difference between fine art and applied art {{has more to do with}} value judgments made <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> than any clear definitional difference. However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see aesthetics); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong emotions. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.|$|E

Schreier found the touch controls to be [...] "just fine", but thought that the game would work better with a D-pad and buttons. He praised the presentation, saying that the music was [...] "superb" [...] and that the game looked great. Slater thought that the game's look was impressive and that the music was excellent. Musgrave called the music [...] "outstanding", and found the monster characters to look fantastic, having benefited greatly from the updated 3D graphics; he was less sure <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> direction for the human characters, but still thought that they looked better {{than they did in}} Sword of Mana.|$|E

The song is a dance track, also incorporating house music influences into its sound. The track opens with acoustic guitar chords, which are then followed by a pop strophe. The refrain consists of a saxophone drop, which is backed by cut saws and plucks. [...] "Dance" [...] ends with the last lyrics of the song being backed by acoustic guitar. Lyrically, the track speaks <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> of dancing, but also features references to friendship and romance. Markos Papadatos from Digital Journal pointed out the opening lyrics of the song for beginning rebellious, but turning into positive and optimistic. He also compared the instrumentation of [...] "Dance" [...] with that one of Kesha's [...] "Die Young".|$|E

500|$|The {{innovations}} of Run-D.M.C., LL Cool J, and {{new school}} producers such as Larry Smith, and Rick Rubin of Def Jam, were quickly advanced {{on by the}} Beastie Boys, Marley Marl and his Juice Crew MCs, Boogie Down Productions, Public Enemy, and Eric B. & Rakim. Hip-hop production became denser, rhymes and beats faster, as the drum machine was augmented with the sampler technology. Rakim took lyrics <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> of rapping to new heights, while KRS-One and Chuck D pushed [...] "message rap" [...] towards black activism. Native Tongues artists' inclusive, sample-crowded music accompanied their positivity, Afrocentricity and playful energy. With the eventual commercial dominance of West Coast gangsta rap, particularly {{the emergence of the}} relaxed sounds of G-funk by the early nineties, the East Coast new school/golden age can be said to have ended, with hardcore rappers such as the Wu-Tang Clan and gangsta rappers such as Nas and The Notorious B.I.G. coming to dominate the East Coast scene.|$|E
