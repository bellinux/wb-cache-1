The city's main terrestrial television and FM radio transmitter sits atop Mount Cargill, north of the city, while the city's main <b>AM</b> <b>transmitter</b> is located at Highcliff, east of the city centre on the Otago Peninsula. Local radio stations include Radio Dunedin, community station Otago Access Radio (formerly Hills AM, then Toroa Radio), and the university radio station, Radio One. The city has one local television station, Dunedin Television, part of Allied Press.|$|E
25|$|As of 2010 Norkring {{stated that}} they were {{interested}} in entering the market in Wallonia, Belgium, and Poland. The Vigra Transmitter was closed in 2011 and Røst followed the following year, leaving Ingøy as the only <b>AM</b> <b>transmitter</b> in Norway. The Parliament of Norway decided in 2011 that the FM network would be closed in 2017 or 2019, with full coverage being ready in 2014. The only parliamentary party to oppose the transition was the Progress Party. The decision resulted in a large-scale expansion of the DAB network in Norway. NRK stated that the longer overlap period, compared to that of television, would give significantly higher broadcasting costs. Following the closure of TV3 in February 2012 and as all other channels were being broadcast on Multiplex A, Norkring decided to close its Slovenian network. Norkring was awarded the second DAB multiplex in an auction held by the Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority in 2012, where the company bid NOK4 million. The multiplex has a capacity for fifteen DAB+ channels.|$|E

2500|$|Continental Electronics {{was founded}} in Dallas in 1946 by James O. Weldon, as a {{spin-off}} of the broadcast consulting business {{in which he was}} a partner, Weldon & Carr. [...] In 1953, when Western Electric's radio equipment business was broken up by Federal antitrust regulators, Continental acquired the <b>AM</b> <b>transmitter</b> business, and with it the U.S. patent on the Doherty linear RF amplifier. [...] Continental became part of Ling-Temco-Vought in about 1962, {{the first in a series}} of sales which would later bring it under the control of E-Systems and then Varian Associates in 1985. [...] Tech-Sym acquired Continental from Varian in 1990, and then sold it to Integrated Defense Technologies in 2000. [...] DRS Technologies acquired IDT in 2003, and in 2005, private-equity firm Veritas Capital (which had previously owned IDT) bought Continental back from DRS. [...] Weldon remained with the company until his retirement in 1988.|$|E
2500|$|One {{method of}} {{producing}} an SSB signal {{is to remove}} one of the sidebands via filtering, leaving only either the upper sideband (USB), the sideband with the higher frequency, or less commonly the lower sideband (LSB), the sideband with the lower frequency. Most often, the carrier is reduced or removed entirely (suppressed), being referred to in full as single sideband suppressed carrier (SSBSC). Assuming both sidebands are symmetric, which {{is the case for}} a normal AM signal, no information is lost in the process. [...] Since the final RF amplification is now concentrated in a single sideband, the effective power output is greater than in normal AM (the carrier and redundant sideband account for well over half of the power output of an <b>AM</b> <b>transmitter).</b> Though SSB uses substantially less bandwidth and power, it cannot be demodulated by a simple envelope detector like standard AM.|$|E
2500|$|FM and DAB {{transmitters}} are {{operated by}} Norkring throughout the country. The concession for two national DAB multiplexes {{are held by}} Norkring, while the regional blocks are owned by NRK, but the infrastructure is {{owned and operated by}} Norkring. The FM network is created through 1,700 transmitters, which give a 99.5-percent coverage for P1 and significantly less for all other stations. The FM network includes support for Radio Data System. The only <b>AM</b> <b>transmitter</b> still in use is at Ingøy, which broadcasts NRK P1 to the fishing fleet in the Barents Sea. Kvitsøy remains the only shortwave transmitter, broadcasting Polish Radio External Service and Radio Romania International. As of 2010, NRK broadcasts P1, P2, P3, mP3, Alltid Nyheter, Alltid Klassisk and Sápmi on both DAB and FM. Super, Gull, Jazz, Klassisk, Folkemusikk, [...] is broadcast only on DAB.

50|$|The {{operator}} attaches a transmitter to {{an animal}} that gives off unique electromagnetic radio signals, which allows the animal to <b>be</b> located. <b>Transmitters</b> <b>are</b> available {{in a variety of}} forms and consist of an antenna, a power source, and the electronics required to produce a signal. <b>Transmitters</b> <b>are</b> chosen based on the behavior, size, and life history of the specific species being studied. In order to reduce the impact of the transmitter on the animal's behavior and quality of life, transmitters typically weigh no more than five percent of the animal's body weight. Unfortunately, the smaller the transmitter, the weaker and shorter-lived it <b>is.</b> <b>Transmitters</b> <b>are</b> often designed to fall off the animal {{at the conclusion of the}} study due to the unlikelihood of recapturing the tagged animals. Large animals require transmitters in the form of collars, which leave room for the animal to grow without falling off. Ear tag <b>transmitters</b> <b>are</b> commonly attached to the ear of large animals that have changing neck sizes. Lightweight, adhesive <b>transmitters</b> <b>are</b> glued to the backs of smaller animals, such as bats. Necklace packs <b>are</b> <b>transmitters</b> that fit around the neck of upland game birds. Subcutaneous <b>transmitters</b> <b>are</b> applied to aquatic animals, which allows them to freely navigate underwater. Whip antennas <b>are</b> an omni-directional <b>transmitter</b> design that produces more signal over a greater distance. A harness loop antenna design, implemented for small birds, involves a transmitter being wrapped around the body.|$|R
2500|$|The {{discovery}} in 1912 of the amplifying {{ability of the}} Audion vacuum tube, invented in 1906 by Lee De Forest, solved these problems. [...] The vacuum tube feedback oscillator, invented in 1912 by Edwin Armstrong and Alexander Meissner, was a cheap source of continuous waves and could be easily modulated to make an <b>AM</b> <b>transmitter.</b> [...] Modulation {{did not have to}} be done at the output but could be applied to the signal before the final amplifier tube, so the microphone or other audio source didn't have to handle high power. [...] Wartime research greatly advanced the art of AM modulation, and after the war the availability of cheap tubes sparked a great increase in the number of radio stations experimenting with AM transmission of news or music. [...] The vacuum tube was responsible for the rise of AM radio broadcasting around 1920, the first electronic mass entertainment medium. [...] Amplitude modulation was virtually the only type used for radio broadcasting until FM broadcasting began after World War 2.|$|E
