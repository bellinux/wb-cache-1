5|$|The idea of {{attracting}} American fans through television {{has long been}} a goal of the CFL <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> have been intermittent. As early as 1954, the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (forerunner of the CFL's East Division) struck a deal with NBC that lasted a year and featured 13 games. The infamous Fog Bowl of 1962 was—at least until play was suspended—broadcast by ABC. Over subsequent years various non-major networks picked up an assortment of games.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of this {{experiment}} were accurate, Fricke misinterpreted {{the data to}} mean that the cell membrane is a single molecular layer. Prof. Dr. Evert Gorter (1881–1954) and F. Grendel of Leiden University approached the problem from a different perspective, spreading the erythrocyte lipids as a monolayer on a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. When they compared {{the area of the}} monolayer to the surface area of the cells, they found a ratio of two to one. Later analyses showed several errors and incorrect assumptions with {{this experiment}} but, serendipitously, these errors canceled out and from this flawed data Gorter and Grendel drew the correct conclusion- that the cell membrane is a lipid bilayer.|$|E

5|$|Drivers are {{not legally}} {{required}} to take field sobriety tests, <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> are admissible in court. The Alcotest has replaced the Breathalyzer as the standard device for determining blood alcohol level. When a driver is arrested for DUI, the police are prohibited from using force to obtain a breath, blood, or urine sample, and must warn {{the driver of the}} consequences of refusing a breath sample. In 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the breath sample refusal conviction of a non-English speaking driver, ruling that drivers must be notified of the law in a language that they understand. A person can be charged with DUI or breath refusal up to 90 days after the incident, except in cases of serious injury or death, in which case the statute of limitations is 5 years.|$|E
5|$|The reentry {{phenomenology}} was {{of interest}} {{both to the}} Army, as it might allow long-range decluttering to be carried out, and to the Air Force, whose own ICBMs might be at risk of long-range interception if the Soviets exploited a similar concept. A program to test these concepts was {{a major part of}} ARPA's Project Defender, especially Project PRESS, which started in 1960. This led to the construction of high-power radar systems on Roi-Namur, the northernmost point of the Kwajalein atoll. <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> remain classified, several sources mention the failure to find a reliable signature of this sort.|$|E
5|$|Waterfall Gully Road is {{meandering}} and in {{some parts}} quite narrow. This has led to concerns regarding safety, as the road is frequented by both pedestrians and cyclists. After {{the death of a}} cyclist in 2007, calls for the repair and resurfacing of the road intensified, with two petitions being tabled in parliament. The accident also led to a safety audit being conducted by TransportSA, and <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> were not released to the public at the time, it called for an investigation of {{the entire length of the}} road. As of mid-2008, there has been no clear plan released for the future of the road, with the road missing out on funding in the 2008 state budget.|$|E

5|$|Kruger's second volksraad sat for {{the first}} time in 1891. Any {{resolution}} it passed had to be ratified by the first volksraad; its role was in effect largely advisory. Uitlanders could vote in elections for the second volksraad after two years' residency on the condition they were naturalised as burghers—a process requiring the renunciation of any foreign allegiance. The residency qualification for naturalised burghers to join the first volksraad electorate was raised from five to 14 years, with the added criterion that they had to be at least 40 years old. During the close-run campaign for the 1893 election, in which Kruger was again challenged by Joubert with the Chief Justice John Gilbert Kotzé as a third candidate, the President indicated that he was prepared to lower the 14-year residency requirement so long as it would not risk the subversion of the state's independence. The electoral result was announced as 7,854 votes for Kruger, 7,009 for Joubert, and 81 for Kotzé. Joubert's supporters alleged procedural irregularities and demanded a recount; the ballots were counted twice more and <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> varied slightly each time, every count gave Kruger a majority. Joubert conceded and Kruger was inaugurated for the third time on 12 May 1893.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from these}} successes, Amon's racing career seemed {{once again to}} have stalled. However, a chance meeting with Mo Nunn of Ensign Racing led to two GP drives in the Ensign N175 at the Austrian and Italian GPs. <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> were unremarkable, he and Nunn worked well together, so Amon joined Ensign for the 1976 F1 season.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately, {{human rights}} {{violations}} tend to be common during insurgencies and counterinsurgency efforts. Western powers conducting multiple foreign internal defense (FID) operations are coming under increasing pressure to provide human rights and Geneva Conventions training to host nation personnel, <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> vary. Part of the challenge arrives when host nation personnel gets involved in combat without FID advisers, {{who are supposed to}} monitor their conduct and prevent abuses. The 1980-1992 Salvadoran Civil War, where {{human rights violations}} were documented on both sides, can be cited as an example.|$|E
25|$|The airline has {{invested}} in other airlines {{in a bid to}} expand beyond its Singapore base, <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> are often financially negative. In 1989, it went into a tripartite alliance with Delta Air Lines and Swissair, but terminated their partnership in 1999 after divesting their 5% equity stake in each other's company. The airline purchased 25% of Air New Zealand in 2000. However following the near collapse of Air New Zealand, the New Zealand government bought into the airline to rescue it from bankruptcy, reducing Singapore Airlines' stake to 4.5%. This was subsequently sold in October 2004 at a substantial loss.|$|E

Three teams – Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Barbados – were undefeated (either winning or drawing all their matches), but Jamaica had more points than the other teams, thus winning their inaugural title. Barbadian batsman Robin Bynoe led the tournament in runs, while Guyanese pace bowler Philbert Blair was the leading wicket-taker.|$|E
25|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) has been {{demonstrated}} {{to be a major}} contributor to angiogenesis, increasing the number of capillaries in a given network. Initial in vitro studies demonstrated bovine capillary endothelial cells will proliferate and show signs of tube structures upon stimulation by VEGF and bFGF, <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> were more pronounced with VEGF. Upregulation of VEGF is a major component of the physiological response to exercise and its role in angiogenesis is suspected to be a possible treatment in vascular injuries. In vitro studies clearly demonstrate that VEGF is a potent stimulator of angiogenesis because, in the presence of this growth factor, plated endothelial cells will proliferate and migrate, eventually forming tube structures resembling capillaries.|$|E
25|$|Thus, by {{the early}} twentieth century the chemical, but not the {{structural}} nature of the cell membrane was known. Two experiments in 1924 laid the groundwork to fill in this gap. By measuring the capacitance of erythrocyte solutions Fricke determined that the cell membrane was 3.3nm thick. <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of this experiment were accurate, Fricke misinterpreted the data to mean that the cell membrane is a single molecular layer. Because the polar lipid headgroups are fully hydrated, they do not show up in a capacitance measurement meaning that this experiment actually measured the thickness of the hydrocarbon core, not the whole bilayer. Gorter and Grendel approached the problem from a different perspective, performing a solvent extraction of erythrocyte lipids and spreading the resulting material as a monolayer on a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. When they compared the area of the monolayer to the surface area of the cells, they found a ratio of two to one. Later analyses of this experiment showed several problems including an incorrect monolayer pressure, incomplete lipid extraction and a miscalculation of cell surface area. In spite of these issues the fundamental conclusion- that the cell membrane is a lipid bilayer- was correct.|$|E
