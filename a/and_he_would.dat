5|$|This {{recursive}} {{formulation of}} addition {{was developed by}} Dedekind as early as 1854, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> expand upon it in the following decades. He proved the associative and commutative properties, among others, through mathematical induction.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> then <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{take off}} his coat, <b>and</b> begin. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> send the girl out for sixpen’orth of nails, {{and then one of}} the boys after her to tell her what size to get; <b>and,</b> from that, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{gradually}} work down, and start the whole house.|$|R
60|$|But, {{when he saw}} all {{the nice}} things inside, instead of being delighted, he was quite frightened, <b>and</b> wished <b>he</b> had never come there. <b>And</b> then <b>he</b> <b>would</b> only touch them, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> did; <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>would</b> only taste one, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> did; <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>would</b> only eat one, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> did; <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>would</b> only eat two, and then three, and so on; <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> was terrified lest she should come and catch him, and began gobbling them down so fast {{that he did not}} taste them, or have any {{pleasure}} in them; <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> felt sick, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> have only one more; and then only one more again; and so on till he had eaten them all up.|$|R
50|$|Thereupon Seketoa {{threw down}} the club <b>and</b> said that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go to drown {{himself in the}} sea and become a fish, leaving Moimoi behind to run the errands for Māatu. <b>And</b> <b>he,</b> Seketoa, <b>would</b> watch the seas of these islands {{until the end of}} the world, that no fish would ever kill a person, and Māatu would have the right to call him anytime <b>and</b> <b>he</b> then <b>would</b> come in the shape of a fish.|$|R

5|$|By {{the morning}} of 16 August, both Montanan and West Bridge were still afloat, albeit with decks awash. Despite {{attempts}} to get Montanan under tow, she foundered later in the morning. Meanwhile, Hawkins and his executive officer were taken by boat to West Bridge to assess her situation. After boarding the ship and finding three cargo holds and her engineering spaces completely flooded, Hawkins advised Burrows captain that the situation was hopeless <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> only be endangering his ship, crew, and the West Bridge survivors by remaining alongside. Consequently, Burrows departed for Brest, France, leaving destroyer Smith to stand by West Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Daya Shankar Pandey as Goli (seamer), the {{man with}} the largest piece of land.

Pandey credited Ashutosh for his acting in the film, saying that Ashutosh <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> discuss the required emotions and expressions before shooting.|$|E

6000|$|The {{insurance}} money {{he was to}} receive made everything humane and kindly <b>and</b> practicable. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> [...] "clear out," [...] with justice <b>and</b> humanity. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> take exactly twenty-one pounds, {{and all the rest}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> leave to Miriam. That seemed to him absolutely fair. Without him, she could do all sorts of things--all the sorts of things she was constantly urging him to do.|$|R

Buddy followed his father into politics, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> eventually also serve as U.S. Senator from Florida.|$|E
5|$|However, Brazil's {{champion}} {{in the fight for}} the abolition of slavery was dying. While in Europe, the first symptoms of mouth cancer appeared. Rio Branco was a heavy smoker, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> daily smoke up to thirty Cuban cigars specially imported for him from Havana. Until July 1880, he was still making appearances in Parliament to deliver speeches, but after that date he no longer attended. Rio Branco still kept a close watch on political developments, however, and continued to appear at meetings of the Council of State. He had already retired from teaching in 1877.|$|E
6000|$|Well, {{a father}} must learn resignation, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> for one <b>would</b> not {{stand in the}} way of his girl's happiness. A day would come when, very beautifully <b>and</b> tenderly, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> hand her over to Magnet, his {{favourite}} daughter to his trusted friend. [...] "Well, my boy, there's no one in all the world----" [...] <b>he</b> <b>would</b> begin.|$|R

5|$|In March 1825, Lafayette {{began to}} tour the {{southern}} and western states. The general pattern of the trip {{was that he would}} be escorted between cities by the state militia, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> enter each town through specially constructed arches to be welcomed by local politicians or dignitaries, all eager to be seen with Lafayette. There would be special events, visits to battlefields and historic sites, celebratory dinners, and time set aside for the public to meet the legendary hero of the Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Many people {{weighed in}} on the {{decision}} on both national and local levels. Auriemma felt guilty that he put Sales through the ordeal and was angry that some columnists chose to fault her and not him.

5|$|Murad sent Hadım Şehabeddin, Beylerbey (or governor) of Rumelia, to annex Wallachia in August 1442. Hunyadi annihilated the Ottoman {{army in the}} Carpathian Mountains in September, {{and made}} Vlad's cousin, Basarab, voivode of Wallachia. Before {{the end of the}} year, Murad II {{released}} Vlad. Vlad had to pledge that he would not support the enemies of the Ottoman Empire <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> pay an annual tribute and send 500 Wallachian boys to serve as janissaries in the sultan's army. He was also forced to leave his two sons, Vlad and Radu, as hostages in the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

5|$|On May 18, 2017 sources {{confirmed}} that Cotto had parted ways with promoter Roc Nation Sports. One {{of the main}} reasons for the split was due to not having an opponent lined up even though he mentioned 2017 would be his last year in the sport <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> like to have had two fights. A fight with Japanese boxer Yoshihiro Kamegai (27-3-2, 24 KOs) was penciled in for June 24, but fell through. HBO also did not back the fight.|$|E
60|$|He advised Lewisham {{to get a}} ring, <b>and</b> said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{need two}} witnesses.|$|R
60|$|He {{complained of}} soreness, <b>and</b> said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go home. I {{suggested}} a cab, but he replied that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rather walk.|$|R
60|$|By <b>and</b> by <b>he</b> {{rolled out}} <b>and</b> jumped {{up on his}} feet looking wild, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> see me <b>and</b> went for me. He chased me round and round the place with a clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, <b>and</b> saying <b>he</b> <b>would</b> kill me, <b>and</b> then I couldn't come for him no more. I begged, and told him I was only Huck; but he laughed SUCH a screechy laugh, and roared and cussed, and kept on chasing me up. Once when I turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and dropped down with {{his back against the}} door, <b>and</b> said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rest a minute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, <b>and</b> said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> sleep <b>and</b> get strong, <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>would</b> see who was who.|$|R

5|$|Prior to Katherine's words, {{the view}} {{had been for}} Rowe {{to act as a}} {{surrogate}} mother; she would give the baby to Jackson as a friendly favor <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> raise it. Jackson intended to issue a statement following the birth that the identity of the mother was a secret, {{in the same way that}} the identities of many surrogates are protected. Katherine's involvement, however, influenced Jackson to call Rowe and ask her to meet him in Australia, where he was staying, as soon as she could. There, the entertainer announced his plans for them to wed the next day.|$|E
5|$|Some {{accounts}} of Nostradamus's life state {{that he was}} afraid of being persecuted for heresy by the Inquisition, but neither prophecy nor astrology fell in this bracket, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have been in danger only if he had practised magic to support them. In 1538 he came into conflict with the Church in Agen after an Inquisitor visited the area looking for Anti-Catholic views. His brief imprisonment at Marignane in late 1561 was solely because he had violated a recent royal decree by publishing his 1562 almanac without the prior permission of a bishop.|$|E
