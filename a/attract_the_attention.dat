5|$|In some jurisdictions, asexuals have legal protections. While Brazil bans since 1999 {{whatever}} pathologization or attempted {{treatment of}} sexual orientation by mental health professionals through the national ethical code, the U.S. state of New York has labeled asexuals as a protected class. However, asexuality does not typically <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of the public or major scrutiny; therefore, {{it has not been}} the subject of legislation as much as other sexual orientations have.|$|E
5|$|Mark Lindsay Chapman as Chief Officer Henry Wilde: The ship's chief officer, who lets Cal {{on board}} a {{lifeboat}} {{because he has a}} child in his arms.

5|$|The New Zealanders {{would follow}} {{in due course}} but in the meantime, General Sir Douglas Haig, the {{commander}} of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), called for diversionary actions to <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of the German High Command away from the Allied preparations for the forthcoming offensive on the Somme. To achieve this, the New Zealanders mounted several trench raids. By the time the New Zealand Division was relieved in August, it had incurred 2,500 casualties, including 375 dead.|$|E
5|$|The active visual {{warnings}} {{are usually}} {{in the form of}} flashing lights. These flash in order to <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of other road users as the ambulance approaches, or to provide warning to motorists approaching a stopped ambulance in a dangerous position on the road. Common colours for ambulance warning beacons are blue, red, amber, and white (clear). However the colours may vary by country and sometimes by operator.|$|E
5|$|At a {{hotel in}} Richmond, Virginia, Chester Ray Banton (Tony Shalhoub) walks along a {{corridor}} up to reach a door, which he then frantically knocks on while shouting the name ″Morris″. Banton's shouts <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of Patrick Newirth, a guest in the room across the hall. When Newirth looks through his room door's peephole, Banton steps back, causing his body shadow slips beneath the door. Newirth suddenly evaporates, leaving a strange burn mark on the floor. Banton realizes what has happened and flees the scene.|$|E

5|$|At one time, {{the island}} was {{considered}} an arid location, where coconuts were the only useful plants likely to flourish and vegetables were difficult to produce. In {{what has become a}} tropical climate, vegetation is more abundant than in the north of the country, especially during the wet season. Anxious to <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of the French colonial administration which he judged insufficiently involved in the development of Casamance, administrator Emmanuel Bertrand-Bocandé submitted a report which documented in great detail the plant species then present on the island. Although this report was written in 1849, the information it contains has remained valuable even into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1984, Girlschool were {{in need of a}} new lead guitar player and singer, of a new recording contract and chart success but, despite the difficult situation, the band did not give up. The search for new members ended with the arrival of guitarist Cris Bonacci and singer and keyboard player Jackie Bodimead, both from the all-female hard rock band She. She were playing in London clubs at the time, trying to get a record contract and <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of the British music press.|$|E

5|$|Cooper {{also found}} {{work in a}} variety of non-Western films, appearing, for example, as a masked Cossack in The Eagle (1925), as a Roman guard in Ben-Hur (1925), and as a flood {{survivor}} in The Johnstown Flood (1926). Gradually, he began to land credited roles that offered him more screen time, in films such as Tricks (1925), in which he played the film's antagonist, and the short film Lightnin' Wins (1926). As a featured player, he began to <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of major film studios. On June 1, 1926, Cooper signed a contract with Samuel Goldwyn Productions for fifty dollars a week.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-16th century, Chiprovtsi {{began to}} <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of Catholic {{officials}} from Rome. In 1565, {{the archbishop of}} Antivari (today Bar, Montenegro) Ambrosius arrived in the town as an apostolic visitor. In 1592–1595, the Bosnian Croat cleric Peter Solinat {{and a group of}} Franciscans established a Catholic mission in the town. In 1601, Solinat was appointed bishop of Sofia with his seat in Chiprovtsi by Pope Clement VIII. He chose to reside in Chiprovtsi because Sofia's Catholic population was limited to a handful of Ragusan merchant families.|$|E
5|$|Originally from Lagos, Owumi {{moved to}} Boston, Massachusetts as a child. He played {{football}} and basketball {{from an early age}} and at college level, but subsequently focused on basketball at the Community College of Rhode Island and was named a National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) All-American. He played his final two seasons at Alcorn State. Immediately after college, Owumi failed to <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of National Basketball Association (NBA) teams and played his rookie season in France with AL Roche-la-Molière, with whom he was named most valuable player of the league.|$|E

5|$|Over the Hedge is {{presented}} in full 3D on both of the Nintendo DS' screens, which is not often seen in a Nintendo DS game. The upper screen displays the game in an over-the-shoulder third person perspective, whereas the touch screen shows an overhead perspective. The lower screen indicates the sight range of enemies {{and can be used}} as a touch screen to target enemies to attack. The console's microphone is used to <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of dogs or to rouse the woodland creatures should they be knocked unconscious.|$|E
5|$|The {{company was}} self-supporting, {{with its own}} engineer, signals, transport, and {{quartermaster}} sections. The signals section had a powerful but cumbersome Wireless Set No. 11 for communicating with the 7th Division. Powered by lead-acid batteries which were recharged with petrol generators, it required multiple signallers to carry and the noise was liable to <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of the enemy. The platoons were equipped with the new Army No. 208 Wireless Sets. These were small, portable sets developed for the communication needs of units on the move in jungle warfare. However, the 2/6th Independent Company had not had {{time to work with}} them operationally.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} protest in Ottawa, {{the capital city}} of Canada, took place on 4 February 2009 at Parliament Hill in an effort to <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of Canada's {{parliament}} members. Thousands of Tamils gathered in front of the Peace Tower, subsequently drawing out a few politicians from inside, notably Bev Oda and New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jack Layton. Layton announced that he would call parliament to an emergency debate at the House of Commons. Oda announced that the government would provide financial aid to the affected civilians, with the help of World Vision and Médecins Sans Frontières.|$|E

5|$|Between 1941 and 1942, American ornithologist Melbourne Armstrong Carriker {{collected}} 27 {{specimens of}} the Perijá tapaculo in six locations {{on the western}} side of the Serranía del Perijá. He identified them as specimens of the northern white-crowned tapaculo (S.atratus), despite size and colour differences, and sent them to the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. In 1953, the specimens began to <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of biologists, and were successively identified as the brown-rumped tapaculo (S.latebricola), the Caracas tapaculo (S.caracae), and the Mérida tapaculo (S.meridanus). Some further believed that the specimens could belong to an undescribed species, or constitute a subspecies of the pale-bellied tapaculo (S.griseicollis) or the Mérida tapaculo based on morphological studies, but they were never classified as any of these.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{began to}} <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of big-name clubs in late 1987, with Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Rangers all {{reported}} {{to be interested in}} signing him. Manchester United quickly emerged as the front runners for his signature, and Bruce publicly expressed his desire to sign for the club. The deal came close to collapsing when Norwich asked for a transfer fee of £900,000 after initially agreeing to accept £800,000, leading to Bruce refusing to play any further matches for the club, which he felt was jeopardising his dream move. On 17 December 1987, shortly before his 27th birthday, the deal was concluded and Bruce officially left Carrow Road, for a fee reported as £800,000 or £825,000. Norwich fans remembered his contribution, and in 2002 voted him into the Norwich City Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Colonies {{are usually}} {{situated}} on islands, cliffs or headlands, which land mammals have difficulty accessing. This {{is thought to}} provide protection to seabirds, which are often very clumsy on land. Coloniality often arises in types of bird that do not defend feeding territories (such as swifts, which have a very variable prey source); {{this may be a}} reason why it arises more frequently in seabirds. There are other possible advantages: colonies may act as information centres, where seabirds returning to the sea to forage can find out where prey is by studying returning individuals of the same species. There are disadvantages to colonial life, particularly the spread of disease. Colonies also <b>attract</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> of predators, principally other birds, and many species attend their colonies nocturnally to avoid predation.|$|E
