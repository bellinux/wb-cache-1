5000|$|The reactor {{was shut}} down in 1987 when the Secretary of Energy {{determined}} that no more plutonium was needed and placed on cold standby in 1988, with [...] "final deactivation" [...] beginning in 1994 and completing in 1998. Deactivation consisted of shutdown and isolation of operational systems and the cleanup of radiological and hazardous waste. N-Reactor (the 105-N Reactor and the 109-N Heat Exchanger Building) were placed in Interim Safe Storage (ISS) in 2012. ISS consists of {{the removal of the}} fuel storage basin, ancillary support facilities, and most portions of the shield wall that surround the 105-N Reactor. In addition, the 109-N Heat Exahanger Building was removed up to the steam generator cells. A new steel roof was installed over the remaining structures. Before and after pictures are found in the facility status change form. Final room status report of the current <b>as-left</b> condition of accessible rooms in the ISS has been documented.|$|E

40|$|Radiological {{contamination}} {{was identified}} in surface {{soil in the}} perimeter area of the former HWMF (near Brookhaven Avenue) in 2005, referred to herein as the former HWMF Perimeter Area. Additional investigation identified radiological contamination within an area of 18, 750 ft 2 (1, 750 m 2) north of Brookhaven Avenue, referred to herein as the contiguous area, {{as well as in}} eleven discrete locations within wooded areas adjacent to the northeastern, northwestern, and southeastern corners of the former HWMF boundaries. The contamination is believed to be a result of historical operations associated with the transfer of wastes to the former HWMF and historical stormwater runoff from contaminated soils within the facility. The cleanup of the former HWMF Perimeter Area was performed as a non-time-critical removal action authorized by the Final Action Memorandum, Removal Action for Contaminated Soil from the Former Hazardous Waste Management Facility Perimeter Area (June, 2009). The cleanup of this area used the same cleanup goals and methodology required for radiologically contaminated soils in the Operable Unit (OU) I Record of Decision (ROD). The soil cleanup objectives for radiological contamination were based on a dose, from remaining concentrations of all radionuclides present, of {{less than or equal to}} 15 millirem per year (mrem/year) above background to a resident (non-farmer) after 50 years of institutional control. Soil remediation activities for the former HWMF Perimeter Area commenced in June, 2009 and were completed in November, 2009. The following summarizes the <b>as-left</b> conditions at the former HWMF Perimeter Area and how they satisfy the requirements of the OU I ROD:...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Order 458. 1 {{requires}} {{independent verification}} (IV) of DOE cleanup projects (DOE 2011). The Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) {{has been designated}} as the responsible organization for IV of the High Flux Beam Reactor (HFBR) Stack and Grounds area at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in Upton, New York. The IV evaluation may consist of an in-process inspection with document and data reviews (Type A Verification) or a confirmatory survey of the site (Type B Verification). DOE and ORISE determined that a Type A verification of the documents and data for the HFBR Stack and Grounds: Survey Units (SU) 6, 7, and 8 was appropriate based on the initial survey unit classification, the walkover surveys, and the final analytical results provided by the Brookhaven Science Associates (BSA). The HFBR Stack and Grounds surveys began in June 2011 and were completed in September 2011. Survey activities by BSA included gamma walkover scans and sampling of the <b>as-left</b> soils {{in accordance with the}} BSA Work Procedure (BNL 2010 a). The Field Sampling Plan - Stack and Remaining HFBR Outside Areas (FSP) stated that gamma walk-over surveys would be conducted with a bare sodium iodide (NaI) detector, and a collimated detector would be used to check areas with elevated count rates to locate the source of the high readings (BNL 2010 b). BSA used the Mult- Agency Radiation Survey and Site Investigation Manual (MARSSIM) principles for determining the classifications of each survey unit. Therefore, SUs 6 and 7 were identified as Class 1 and SU 8 was deemed Class 2 (BNL 2010 b). Gamma walkover surveys of SUs 6, 7, and 8 were completed using a 2 ï¿½ 2 NaI detector coupled to a data-logger with a global positioning system (GPS). The 100 % scan surveys conducted prior to the final status survey (FSS) sampling identified two general soil areas and two isolated soil locations with elevated radioactivity. The general areas of elevated activity identified were investigated further with a collimated NaI detector. The uncollimated average gamma count rate was less than 15, 000 counts per minute (cpm) for the SU 6, 7, and 8 composite area (BNL 2011 a). Elevated count rates were observed in portions of each survey unit. The general areas of elevated counts near the Building 801 ventilation and operations and the entry to the Stack were determined to be directly related to the radioactive processes in those structures. To compensate for this radioactive shine, a collimated or shielded detector was used to lower the background count rate (BNL 2011 b and c). This allowed the surveyor(s) to distinguish between background and actual radioactive contamination. Collimated gamma survey count rates in these shine affected areas were below 9, 000 cpm (BNL 2011 a). The average background count rate of 7, 500 cpm was reported by BSA for uncollimated NaI detectors (BNL 2011 d). The average collimated background ranged from 4, 500 - 6, 500 cpm in the westernmost part of SU 8 and from 2, 000 - 3, 500 cpm in all other areas (BNL 2011 e). Based on these data, no further investigations were necessary for these general areas. SU 8 was the only survey unit that exhibited verified elevated radioactivity levels. The first of two isolated locations of elevated radioactivity had an uncollimated direct measurement of 50, 000 cpm with an area background of 7, 500 cpm (BNL 2011 f). The second small area exhibiting elevated radiation levels was identified at a depth of 6 inches from the surface. The maximum reported count rate of 28, 000 cpm was observed during scanning (BNL 2011 g). The affected areas were remediated, and the contaminated soils were placed in an intermodal container for disposal. BSA&#x 27;s post-remediation walkover surveys were expanded to include a 10 -foot radius around the excavated locations, and it was determined that further investigation was not required for these areas (BNL 2011 f and g). The post-remediation soil samples were collected and analyzed with onsite gamma spectroscopy equipment. These samples were also included with the FSS samples that were analyzed at an offsite facility for the primary radionuclides of concern (ROCs) (i. e., cesium- 137, strontium- 90, and radium- 226). Analysis included full spectrum gamma spectroscopy for all samples. Sr- 90 analysis was completed on all samples from SUs 6 and 7. However Sr- 90 was only completed on the cores, composites, field blank and duplicate samples in SU 8. Alpha spectroscopy as well as liquid scintillation performed for tritium, carbon- 14, and nickel- 63 concentrations were completed on the composite samples from SUs 6 and 7. Various cores, composites, and samples from the remediated areas of SU 8 received alpha spectroscopy as well as liquid scintillation analyses for tritium, carbon- 14, and nickel- 63 to determine respective ROC concentrations (BNL 2011 h, i, and j). BSA submitted the FSS data and analytical results to demonstrate that remediation efforts complied with the specified cleanup goal of {{less than or equal to}} 15 millirem per year (mrem/yr) above background to a resident in 50 years (BNL 2011 a through j). ORISE has reviewed the project documentation and FSS data for the HFBR Stack and Grounds: SUs 6, 7, and 8. The highest concentrations of the primary ROCs reported were 5. 92 picocuries per gram (pCi/g) for Cs- 137 and 2. 03 pCi/g for Sr- 90, with both ROCs having the qualifier for the sample result as less than the minimum detectable activity (MDA). For Ra- 226, the highest detected concentration from the FSS data provided was 0. 682 pCi/g. Other potential secondary contaminants were below their respective MDAs. Therefore, ORISE is of the opinion that BSA has provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate compliance with the 15 mrem/yr cleanup objectives for the final status survey data provided...|$|E
