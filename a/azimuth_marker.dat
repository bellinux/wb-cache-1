The direction-based service enables a user to point to an object of interest for command or investigation. We also describe the design, implementation and evaluations of a direction-based service system named Azim. With this system, {{the direction of the}} user can be obtained by a magnetic-based direction sensor. The sensor is also used for azimuth-based position estimation, in which a userâ€™s position is estimated by having the user point to and measure <b>azimuths</b> of several <b>markers</b> or objects whose positions are already known. Because this approach does not require any other accurate position sensors or positive beacons, it can be deployed cost-effectively. Also, because the measurements are naturally associated with some degree of error, the position is calculated as a probability distribution. The calculation considers the error of direction measurement and the pre-obtained field information such as obstacles and magnetic field disturbance, which enables robust position measurements even in geomagnetically disturbed environments. For wide-area use, the system also utilizes a wireless LAN to obtain rough position information by identifying base stations. We have implemented a prototype system for the proposed method and some applications for the direction-based services. Furthermore, we have conducted experiments both indoors and outdoors, and exemplified that positioning accuracy by the proposed method is precise enough for a direction-based service. key words: location-based service, direction-based service, direct manipulation interface, magnetic compass, mobile computing, ubiquitous networks, wireless LAN 1...|$|R
