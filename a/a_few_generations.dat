5|$|It is even {{possible}} {{that in any}} one generation no marbles of a particular colour are chosen, meaning they have no offspring. In this example, if no red marbles are selected, the jar representing the new generation contains only blue offspring. If this happens, the red allele has been lost permanently in the population, while the remaining blue allele has become fixed: all future generations are entirely blue. In small populations, fixation can occur in just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>generations.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since {{real time}} conversations are impossible, the humans send {{sections}} of the expedition's library. After reading an astronomy article, a cheela realizes that the supernova half a million human years ago created both their races. Many cheela generations later, {{but only a few}} hours for humans, cheelas develop gravity manipulation. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>generations</b> later, a cheela spacecraft visits the human one. Although they still need extreme gravity fields to survive, the cheela can now control them precisely enough for both races to see each other face-to-face in safety. The cheela have decided that transferring their technologies, now far advanced of humans', would stunt humanity's development. However the cheela leave clues in several challenging locations, before going their separate ways.|$|E
5|$|A concert film, Under Great White Northern Lights premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 18, 2009. The film, {{directed}} by Emmett Malloy, documents the band's summer 2007 tour across Canada and contains live concert and off-stage footage. Jack and Meg White {{appeared at the}} premiere and made a short speech before the movie started about their love of Canada and why they chose to debut their movie in Toronto. The tour was {{in support of the}} album Icky Thump, and they performed in every province. Jack conceived the idea of touring Canada after learning that Scottish relatives on his father's side had lived for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>generations</b> in Nova Scotia before relocating to Detroit to work in the car factories. Additionally, their 10th anniversary occurred during the tour on the day of their show in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, and in this shot, Jack and Meg are dancing {{at the conclusion of the}} concert. The film was {{directed by}} a friend of the duo, Emmett Malloy. A second feature, titled Under Nova Scotian Lights, was prepared for the DVD release.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{consensus}} regarding the exact import of the inscription, scholars seem to agree that its language is some form of Gothic and that the intent behind it was religious. Taylor interprets the inscription as being clearly pagan in nature and indicative {{of the existence of}} a temple to which the ring was a votive offering. He derives his date for the burial (210 to 250) {{from the fact that the}} Christianizing of the Goths along the Danube is generally considered to have been almost complete within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>generations</b> after their having arrived there in 238. Though paganism among the Goths did survive the initial conversion phase of 250 to 300 - as the martyring of the converted Christian Goths Wereka, Batwin (370) and Sabbas (372) at the hands of the indigenously pagan Goths (in the latter case Athanaric) shows - it was weakened considerably in the following years, and the likelihood of such a deposit being made would have been greatly diminished.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} several {{well-documented}} cases in birds where species that are very similar change their habitat use where they overlap. For example, they may consume different food resources or use different nesting habitat or materials. On the Galapagos Islands, finch species have been observed to change dietary specializations in just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>generations</b> in order to utilize limited resources and minimize competition.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the western}} Netherlands was barely {{inhabited}} {{between the end of}} the Roman period until around 1100 AD, when farmers from Flanders and Utrecht began purchasing the swampy land, draining it and cultivating it.

25|$|A {{significant}} {{environmental effect}} is likely {{responsible for the}} different rates of breast cancer incidence between countries with different dietary customs. Researchers have long measured that breast cancer rates in an immigrant population soon come to resemble the rates of the host country after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>generations.</b> The {{reason for this is}} speculated to be immigrant uptake of the host country diet. The prototypical example of this phenomenon is the changing rate of breast cancer after the arrival of Japanese immigrants to America.|$|E

50|$|The {{change of}} noble {{personal}} names, which shifted from Iranian (or another language of different origin) to Slavic, {{simply could not}} have happened in <b>a</b> mere <b>few</b> <b>generations.</b> <b>As</b> such, the time of arrival {{is estimated to be}} during the 7th, and not 9th, century.

25|$|Relationships in the orca {{population}} can {{be discovered}} through their vocalizations. Matrilines {{who share a}} common ancestor from only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>generations</b> back share mostly the same dialect, comprising a pod. Pods who share some calls indicate a common ancestor from many generations back, and make up a clan. Interestingly, the orcas use these dialects to avoid in-breeding. They mate outside the clan, which {{is determined by the}} different vocalizations. There is evidence that other species of dolphins may also have dialects.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{primary use}} of Greyhounds, {{both in the}} British Isles and on the Continent of Europe, was in the coursing of deer. Later, they specialized in competition hare coursing. Some Greyhounds are still used for coursing, although artificial lure sports like lure coursing and racing are far more common and popular. Many leading 300- to 550-yard sprinters have bloodlines traceable back through Irish sires, within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>generations</b> of racers that won {{events such as the}} Irish Coursing Derby or the Irish Cup.|$|E
25|$|There was {{therefore}} no wholesale displacement of native lords in Scotland. In 1200 all the earls north of Forth and Clyde were still of Celtic descent; and {{as late as}} 1286, eight of the earldoms in Scotland {{were still in the}} hands of those of native stock. Many native lords were granted or confirmed in their lands in feudal form. Within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>generations,</b> regular intermarriage and the Wars of Independence had removed most of the differences between native and incomer, although not those between Highlander and Lowlander.|$|E
30|$|Over {{the past}} decades, little {{research}} has been conducted on the volume mesh generation of molecules in biophysics. In 2014, Tu et al.

25|$|Brian did {{not free}} Ireland from a Norse (Viking) occupation, {{simply because it}} was never conquered by the Vikings. In {{the last decade of}} the 8th century, Norse raiders began attacking targets in Ireland and, {{beginning}} in the mid-9th century, these raiders established the fortified camps that later grew into Ireland's first cities: Dublin, Limerick, Waterford, Wexford, and Cork. Within only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>generations,</b> the Norse citizens of these cities had converted to Christianity, intermarried with the Irish, and often adopted the Irish language, dress and customs, thus becoming what historians refer to as the Hiberno-Norse.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} {{intermediate}} host, the miracidium undergoes asexual reproduction for several weeks, which includes sporocyst formation, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>generations</b> of rediae {{and the production}} of cercariae. The cercariae are released from the snail host into water and are also free-swimming. The cercariae penetrate a second intermediate host, or they remain in the first intermediate host, where they form metacercariae. Definitive hosts become infected by eating secondary hosts which are infected with metacercariae. Once the metacercariae have been eaten, they excyst in the intestine of the definitive host where the parasite then develops into an adult.|$|E
