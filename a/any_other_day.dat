500|$|There {{is another}} type of day which, while not a festival, is {{considered}} to be equal with a festival. These days, called Days of Special Devotion, are Ash Wednesday and all the days of Holy Week, especially Good Friday. These particular days, like other festivals, automatically take precedence over any event on the calendar and sometimes even over other festivals. A good example of this would be in 2005 when Good Friday and the Annunciation fell on the same day (March 25). The Annunciation was transferred to March 28, or the second day of Easter, to make room for Good Friday. The principle of the Church of Sweden is that the Annunciation is celebrated on the Sunday between 21–27 March; although, should Good Friday or <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> of Holy Week, or Easter Sunday or Monday respectively, fall on 25 March, Annunciation is moved to the Sunday before Palm Sunday.

500|$|During {{the night}} of 4–5 February, a few protesters {{continued}} to camp out in Tahrir Square. Early in the morning shots were fired as protesters said pro-Mubarak activists tried to assault the square. Troops then fired into the air to disperse them.

As the army tightened access to Tahrir Square, {{the head of the}} army met protesters and asked them to return home. Protesters responded that [...] "he (Mubarak) will go" [...] and they would not. The army was also more organized and present than on <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> of the protest. A heavy military presence continued in central Cairo.

A group of foreigners including an English protester on the 5th and a Swede on the 6th joined the protesters in Tahrir Square, handing out flowers in a sign of solidarity and holding up a banner in English. Five hundred protesters arrived in Tahrir Square from Suez. There were reports of over 10,000 people continuing to stay in Alexandria through the night.|$|E

He also developed a new line of [...] "Toy Bulldogs" [...] which became a craze in France where he sent many specimens who are believed to have been major contributors to a new breed, the French Bulldog. The magazine Country Life, on 29 April 1899 recounts:"Some five-and-thirty years ago in fact, , the small-sized or light-weight Bulldog was common in this country; so much so that dogs of the breed that scaled over 28lbs were not encouraged at such shows as Birmingham, which was at that period the most important exhibition of its kind in England.

[...] He later requested 50,000 reinforcements (which the War Department had no chance of providing). [...] "With them, I will retrieve our fortunes." [...] McClellan has received significant criticism from historians about his detachment from the battle, sailing on the Galena out of touch while his men fought. Ethan Rafuse wrote that after McClellan supervised the deployment of three corps near the Glendale crossroads, what he did next [...] "almost defies belief. ... Even though his men were at the time engaged in a fierce battle near Glendale ... he spent the afternoon on board the Galena, dining with [...] Rodgers and traveling briefly up river to watch the gunboat shelling of a Confederate division that had been spotted marching east along the River road toward Malvern Hill."
