25|$|The word robot was {{introduced}} to the public by the Czech interwar writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), published in 1920. The play begins in a factory that uses a chemical substitute for protoplasm to manufacture living, simplified people called robots. The play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of these living creatures, but in their appearance they prefigure modern ideas of androids, creatures who can be mistaken for humans. These mass-produced workers are depicted as efficient but emotionless, incapable of original thinking and indifferent to self-preservation. <b>At</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> whether the robots are being exploited and the consequences of human dependence upon commodified labor (especially after a number of specially-formulated robots achieve self-awareness and incite robots all around the world to rise up against the humans).|$|E

25|$|Inconsolable Memories (2005) {{is based}} on Tomas Gutierrez Alea's film Memorias del subdesarrollo (Memories of Underdevelopment) from 1968, updated to include {{references}} to the Mariel boatlift of 1980. Douglas's installation consists of a 16mm projection with a photographic series of contemporary Havana, Cuba. The film is looped and when presented as an installation the film and photographs {{create a sense of}} repetition, a common feature of Douglas' work. Rather than strictly working from Alea's film in the manner Douglas worked from Hitchock's Marnie, Inconsolable Memories plays with the layers of its various sources (Cuba in the 1960s, the 1980s and the present). Some of the photographs reference the locations used in the original Alea film tying together the themes of history and memory. <b>At</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> the utopian promise of the Cuban revolution and its decline, and as well, the parallel Cold War events of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 (examined in Alea's film) and the boatlift of 1980.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{psychological}} term, [...] "character" [...] is traditionally used more in continental Europe, while in Britain and North America the term [...] "personality" [...] {{is used in}} approximately the same contexts. Marx however uses the term [...] "character mask" [...] analogously to a theatrical role, where the actor (or {{the characteristics of a}} prop) represents a certain interest or function, and intends by character both [...] "the characteristics of somebody" [...] and [...] "the characteristics of something". Marx's metaphorical use of the term [...] "character masks" [...] refers back to carnival masks and the masks used in classical Greek theatre. <b>At</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> the social form in which a practice is acted out.|$|E
2500|$|Critics of Searle's {{response}} {{argue that}} the program has allowed the man to have two minds in one head. If we assume a [...] "mind" [...] {{is a form of}} information processing, then the theory of computation can account for two computations occurring at once, namely (1) the computation for universal programmability (which is the function instantiated by the person and note-taking materials independently from any particular program contents) and (2) the computation of the Turing machine that is described by the program (which is instantiated by everything including the specific program). The theory of computation thus formally explains the open possibility that the second computation in the Chinese Room could entail a human-equivalent semantic understanding of the Chinese inputs. The focus belongs on the program's Turing machine rather than on the person's. However, from Searle's perspective, this argument is circular. The question <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> whether consciousness is a form of information processing, and this reply requires that we make that assumption.|$|E

"The {{need for}} a {{complete}} method of determining what lesser offenses are included within a charged offense is particularly great where, as here, the statute <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> {{one that can be}} violated in a number of ways," [...] Flaum wrote. [...] "Indeed, the past several years have seen the enactment of a number of criminal statutes that can be violated in various ways, and that in fact are specifically predicated on violations of any number of other legal provisions" [...] such as the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). [...] "They are exactly the type of offenses for which consideration of lesser offenses is appropriate under Rule 31(c), {{but it is hard to}} imagine how any lesser included offense could ever be considered under the elements test, precisely because these 'greater' offenses are so broadly defined."

2500|$|The {{debate has}} become more urgent lately, as the 2008-2009 {{recession}} shaved newspapers' profits, and as once-explosive growth in newspaper web revenues has leveled off, forestalling what the industry hoped would become {{an important source of}} revenue. <b>At</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> whether the newspaper industry faces a cyclical trough (or dip), or whether new technology has rendered print newspapers obsolete, at least in their traditional paper format. As of 2017, an increasing percentage of Millennials (young adults) get their news from social media websites such as Facebook. In the 2010s, many traditional newspapers have begun offering [...] "digital editions", which can be accessed via desktop computer, laptops, and mobile devices such as tablet computers and smartphones.

2500|$|Also {{there is}} a {{question}} about how separate from the idea of -genes birth and begetting the cited uses of monogenes in the sense of [...] "unique" [...] truly are.

Likewise in Plato's Timaeus, the [...] "only-begotten and created Heaven", is still unique in how it is begotten, in comparison to the begetting of animals and men, just as Earth and Heaven give birth to Ocean and Tethys. Of the Liddell Scott references for [...] "unique" [...] (monogenes being used purely as monos) that leaves only Parmenides, which (as above) is no longer considered a likely reading of the Greek text.|$|E

2500|$|Adrian Ballinger and Cory Richards were {{sponsored}} by Eddie Bauer to climb Everest, and they relayed {{information from the}} Everest climb using the smartphone software application and service Snapchat. Mount Everest has had a 3G wireless data communication network since 2010. One {{of the things that}} was reported by them, was that bottled oxygen was stolen from them and there was some bad behaviour up there. The bottled oxygen was there for emergency back-up if they ran into trouble. Cory Richards summited Mount Everest without oxygen and returned safely, and Adrian made it almost to the top also. Another famous mountaineer, British climber Kenton Cool achieved his 12th Everest summit (the second-highest number of Everest summitings for a foreigner after Dave Hahn), and US celebrity mountaineer Melissa Arnot, completed her sixth summit, and achieved her personal goal of climbing Everest without supplementary bottled oxygen. This also turned out to be the most summits for a foreign female (not Nepali or Chinese), and one of the first US women to summit and survive without supplementary oxygen. In 1998 Francys Arsentiev had made it to the summit, but died during the descent; she went on to become a famous corpse as a landmark known as [...] "Sleeping Beauty" [...] until she was buried on Everest in 2007 by one of the people who had tried to help her. Another woman from the Americas, the Ecuadorian woman Carla Perez also summited Mount Everest in 2016 without supplementary oxygen. Perez and Arnot became the fifth and sixth women to summit Everest without supplementary oxygen. There is an ongoing discussion about the use of extra bottled oxygen in mountaineering. Also <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> Dexamethasone (Dex), which is valuable as a lifesaver as it reduces swelling in the brain if someone comes down with high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE). When American Bill Burke was interviewed for his attempt, he noted how one of his team members had overdosed on Dex, prompting a medical evacuation even as in his more recent expedition, someone had 25 doses of Dex. He also noted it was hard to argue against large supplies of Dex, due its life-saving properties against some types of altitude sickness, especially HACE. An example of a death in which Dex was implicated was Dr. Eberhard Schaaf in 2012 on Everest. Schaaf died on descent at the south summit from altitude sickness. It has a good reputation as a life saver, and is commonly given to Everest climbers for its ability to intervene in last desperate moments when altitude sickness sets in. For example, in the 2016 season Robert Gropel said he gave Dex to his wife (as reported by the Telegraph) in attempt to save her as they tried to descend Everest. Of course, Dex is just the tip of the iceberg, with the UIAA noting the aforementioned dexamethasone, but also [...] acetazolamide (aka Diamox), amphetamine, and alcohol use; and another noted Diamox (acetazolamide) use among trekkers. It is not really a matter of some authorities being for or against medications, but awareness, as misuse can cause drug interactions and various side effects. [...] In particular it was noted that supplementary oxygen significantly lowers death rate on ultra-high altitude mountain climbing, and is generally not regulated as a drug, whereas the safe use of medications is less understood or even acknowledged in many cases. (see also: Effects of high altitude on humans) ...|$|E
2500|$|The four-million-year-old Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, a north-south {{trending}} zone of volcanoes and {{volcanic rock}} in the southern Coast Mountains of southwestern British Columbia, can be grouped into at least three enechelon segments, {{referred to as the}} northern, central, and southern segments. The northern segment overlaps the older Pemberton Volcanic Belt at a low angle near Mount Meager where Garibaldi Belt lavas rest on uplifted and deeply eroded remnants of Pemberton Belt subvolcanic intrusions and combines to form a single belt. A few isolated volcanoes northwest of Mount Meager, such as Silverthrone Caldera and Franklin Glacier Volcano, are also grouped as part of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. However, their tectonic origins are largely unexplained and are a matter of going research. When the Farallon Plate ruptured to create the Nootka Fault between five and seven million years ago, there were some apparent changes along the Cascadia subduction zone. <b>At</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> the current plate configuration and rate of subduction but based on rock composition is for Silverthrone Caldera and Franklin Glacier Volcano to be subduction related. The roughly circular, [...] wide, deeply dissected Silverthrone Caldera in the northern segment of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, was formed one million years ago during the Early Pleistocene period. The bulk of the volcano was erupted 0.4million years ago, but younger phases, consisting of lava flows and subsidiary volcanoes with compositions of andesite and basaltic andesite are also present. Mount Silverthrone, an eroded lava dome on the northeast edge of Silverthrone Caldera, was episodically active during both Pemberton and Garibaldi stages of volcanism. The eroded Franklin Glacier Volcano just to the southeast consists of dacite and andesite rocks that range in age from 3.9to 2.2million years old. Southeast of Franklin Glacier Volcano, the Bridge River Cones comprise remnants of both andesitic and alkali basalt cones and lava flows. These range in age from about one million years old to 0.5million years old and commonly display ice-contact features related to subglacial eruptions. Mount Meager, the most persistent volcano in the northern portion of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, is a complex of at least four overlapping stratovolcanoes made of dacite and rhyodacite that become progressively younger from south to north, ranging in age from two million to 2,490years old. The central segment of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt is defined by a group of eight volcanoes on a ridge of highland east of the Squamish River, and by remnants of basaltic lava flows preserved in the adjacent Squamish valley. Mount Cayley, the largest and most persistent volcano, is a deeply eroded stratovolcano comprising a lava dome complex made of dacite and minor rhyodacite ranging in age from 3.8to 0.31million years old. Mount Fee, a narrow volcanic plug made of rhyodacite about [...] long and [...] wide, rises [...] above the highland ridge. Complete denudation of the central spine as well as the absence of till under lava flows from Mount Fee suggest a preglacial age. The other volcanoes of the central Garibaldi Belt, including Ember Ridge, Pali Dome, Cauldron Dome, Slag Hill, Mount Brew and Crucible Dome, were formed during subglacial eruptions to develop tuya-like forms with over-steepened, ice-contact margins. The primary volcanoes in the southern segment are Mount Garibaldi, Mount Price, and The Black Tusk. The oldest volcano, The Black Tusk, is the remnants of an extinct andesitic stratovolcano that formed during two distant stages of volcanic activity, the first between 1.1 and 1.3 million years ago and the second between 0.17 and 0.21 million years ago. Mount Garibaldi, a fairly dissected stratovolcano [...] north of Vancouver, was built by Peléan eruptions between 0.26and 0.22million years ago during the waning stages of the last glacial, or [...] "Wisconsinian", period. Mount Price, a less significant stratovolcano just north of Mount Garibaldi, formed during three distinct periods of volcanic activity beginning at 1.2million years ago and culminating with the eruption of Clinker Peak on its western flank 0.3million years ago. In addition to the large, central andesite-dacite volcanoes, the southern portion of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt includes remnants of basalt and basaltic andesite lava flows and pyroclastic rocks. These include valley -filling lava flows interbedded with till containing wood about 34,000years old.|$|E
