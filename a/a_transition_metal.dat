5|$|The {{definition}} of <b>a</b> <b>transition</b> <b>metal,</b> {{as given by}} IUPAC, is an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell. By this definition all of the elements in groups 3–11 are transition metals. The IUPAC definition therefore excludes group 12, comprising zinc, cadmium and mercury, from the transition metals category.|$|E
5|$|Darmstadtium is {{the eighth}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since copernicium (element 112) {{has been shown to}} be <b>a</b> <b>transition</b> <b>metal,</b> it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series, with darmstadtium as part of the platinum group metals and a noble metal. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue platinum, thus implying that darmstadtium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 10 elements, nickel, palladium, and platinum.|$|E

50|$|The {{salicide}} {{process begins}} with deposition of <b>a</b> thin <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> layer over fully formed and patterned semiconductor devices (e.g. transistors). The wafer is heated, allowing the <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> to react with exposed silicon {{in the active}} regions of the semiconductor device (e.g., source, drain, gate) forming <b>a</b> low-resistance <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> silicide. The <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> does not react with the silicon dioxide nor the silicon nitride insulators present on the wafer. Following the reaction, any remaining <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> is removed by chemical etching, leaving silicide contacts in only the active regions of the device. A fully integrable manufacturing process may be more complex, involving additional anneals, surface treatments, or etch processes.|$|R
5|$|Meitnerium is {{the seventh}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since element 112 (copernicium) {{has been shown to}} be <b>a</b> <b>transition</b> <b>metal,</b> it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series, with meitnerium as part of the platinum group metals. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue iridium, thus implying that meitnerium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 9 elements, cobalt, rhodium, and iridium.|$|E

Since copernicium (element 112) {{has been shown to}} be <b>a</b> <b>transition</b> <b>metal,</b> it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue gold, thus implying that roentgenium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 11 elements, copper, silver, and gold; however, it is also predicted to show several differences from its lighter homologues.|$|E
5|$|Still other chemists further {{exclude the}} group 3 {{elements}} from {{the definition of}} <b>a</b> <b>transition</b> <b>metal.</b> They do so {{on the basis that}} the group 3 elements do not form any ions having a partially occupied d shell and do not therefore exhibit any properties characteristic of transition metal chemistry. In this case, only groups 4–11 are regarded as transition metals. However, though the group 3 elements show few of the characteristic chemical properties of the transition metals, they do show some of their characteristic physical properties (on account of the presence in each atom of a single d electron).|$|E

50|$|Electronic spin {{states are}} more complex for <b>transition</b> <b>metals.</b> To {{understand}} the reactivity of <b>transition</b> <b>metals,</b> {{it is essential to}} understand the concept of d electron configuration as well as high-spin and low-spin configuration. For example, <b>a</b> low-spin d8 <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> complex is usually square planar substitutionally inert with no unpaired electrons.

40|$|Self-assembled multilayers {{consisting}} of <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> ions and biscarboxyl acid molecules have been fabricated by a layer-by-layer chemisorption technique. <b>As</b> <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> ion, zirconium (Zr(IV)) or titanium (Ti(IV)) was employed, while terephthalic acid (TPA) {{was used as}} biscarboxyl molecule. In the multilayers, two TPA monolayers were bridged by one monolayer of Zr(IV) or Ti(IV) most likely through coordination bonds between the metal ions and the carboxyl groups in the TPA molecules. Although the both <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> ions were successfully applied to construct multilayers, the multilayer structure of the Ti–TPA system was more disordered {{than that of the}} Zr–TPA system as revealed by grazing incidence X-ray reflectivity...|$|R
5|$|Hafnium {{had been}} {{predicted}} by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869 and Henry Moseley measured in 1914 the effective nuclear charge by X-ray spectroscopy to be 72, placing it between the already known elements lutetium and tantalum. Dirk Coster and Georg von Hevesy {{were the first}} to search for the new element in zirconium ores. Hafnium was discovered by the two in 1923 in Copenhagen, Denmark, validating the original 1869 prediction of Mendeleev. There has been some controversy surrounding the discovery of hafnium {{and the extent to which}} Coster and Hevesy were guided by Bohr's prediction that hafnium would be <b>a</b> <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> rather than a rare earth element. While titanium and zirconium, as relatively abundant elements, were discovered in the late 18th century, it took until 1923 for hafnium to be identified. This was only partly due to hafnium's relative scarcity. The chemical similarity between zirconium and hafnium made a separation difficult and, without knowing what to look for, hafnium was left undiscovered, although all samples of zirconium, and all of its compounds, used by chemists for over two centuries contained significant amounts of hafnium..|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{the first}} {{ionization}} energy of lawrencium was measured, using the isotope 256Lr. The measured value, , agreed {{very well with}} the relativistic theoretical prediction of 4.963(15)eV, and also provided a first step into measuring the first ionization energies of the transactinides. This value is the lowest among all the lanthanides and actinides, and supports the s2p configuration as the 7p1/2 electron {{is expected to be}} only weakly bound. This suggests that lutetium and lawrencium behave similarly to the d-block elements (and hence being the true heavier congeners of scandium and yttrium, instead of lanthanum and actinium), and also that lawrencium may behave similarly to the alkali metals sodium and potassium in some ways. Given that the s2p configuration is correct, then lawrencium cannot be regarded as <b>a</b> <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> under the IUPAC definition ("An element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell"), unlike its lighter homolog lutetium and the group 3 elements, with which lutetium and lawrencium are sometimes classified. It is nevertheless quite likely that metallic lawrencium will behave similarly to curium, which has an 5f76d17s2 configuration, and show the expected 5f146d17s2 configuration, which is supported by the earlier volatility experiments.|$|E
5|$|The {{elements}} in group 12 are usually {{considered to be}} d-block elements, but not transition elements as the d-shell is full. Some authors classify these elements as main-group elements because the valence electrons are in ns2 orbitals. Nevertheless, they share many characteristics with the neighboring group 11 elements on the periodic table, which are almost universally considered to be transition elements. For example, zinc shares many characteristics with the neighboring transition metal, copper. Zinc complexes merit inclusion in the Irving-Williams series as zinc forms many complexes with the same stoichiometry as complexes of copper(II), albeit with smaller stability constants. There is little similarity between cadmium and silver as compounds of silver(II) are rare {{and those that do}} exist are very strong oxidizing agents. Likewise the common oxidation state for gold is +3, which precludes there being much common chemistry between mercury and gold, though there are similarities between mercury(I) and gold(I) such as the formation of linear dicyano complexes, −. According to IUPAC's definition of transition metal as an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell, zinc and cadmium are not transition metals, while mercury is. This is because only mercury is known to have a compound where its oxidation state is higher than +2, in mercury(IV) fluoride (though its existence is disputed, as later experiments trying to confirm its synthesis could not find evidence of HgF4). However, this classification is based on one highly atypical compound seen at non-equilibrium conditions and is at odds to mercury's more typical chemistry, and Jensen has suggested {{that it would be better}} to regard mercury as not being <b>a</b> <b>transition</b> <b>metal.</b>|$|E

25|$|Copper is a {{soft metal}} (MH 2.5–3.0) with low {{mechanical}} strength. It has a close-packed face-centred cubic structure (BCN 12).

Stable compounds in which copper {{is in its}} less preferred oxidation state of +1 (Cu2O, CuCl, CuBr, CuI and CuCN, for example) have significant covalent character. The oxide (CuO) is amphoteric, with predominating basic properties; it can be fused with alkali oxides (M2O; M = Na, K) to give anionic oxycuprates (M2CuO2). Copper forms Zintl phases such as Li7CuSi2 and M3Cu3Sb4 (M = Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, or Er).|$|E
25|$|In {{complexation}} reactions, several ligands {{react with}} a metal atom to form a coordination complex. This is achieved by providing lone pairs of the ligand into empty orbitals of the metal atom and forming dipolar bonds. The ligands are Lewis bases, they can be both ions and neutral molecules, such as carbon monoxide, ammonia or water. The number of ligands that react with a central metal atom can be found using the 18-electron rule, saying that the valence shells of <b>a</b> <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> will collectively accommodate 18 electrons, whereas the symmetry of the resulting complex can be predicted with the crystal field theory and ligand field theory. Complexation reactions also include ligand exchange, in which one or more ligands are replaced by another, and redox processes which change the oxidation state of the central metal atom.|$|E

25|$|Two {{important}} biological reaction {{mechanisms of}} nitric oxide are S-nitrosation of thiols, and nitrosylation of transition metal ions. S-nitrosation involves the (reversible) conversion of thiol groups, including cysteine residues in proteins, to form S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs). S-Nitrosation is {{a mechanism for}} dynamic, post-translational regulation of most or all major classes of protein. The second mechanism, nitrosylation, involves the binding of NO to <b>a</b> <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> ion like iron or copper. In this function, NO {{is referred to as}} a nitrosyl ligand. Typical cases involve the nitrosylation of heme proteins like cytochromes, thereby disabling the normal enzymatic activity of the enzyme. Nitrosylated ferrous iron is particularly stable, as the binding of the nitrosyl ligand to ferrous iron (Fe(II)) is very strong. Hemoglobin is a prominent example of a heme protein that may be modified by NO by both pathways: NO may attach directly to the heme in the nitrosylation reaction, and independently form S-nitrosothiols by S-nitrosation of the thiol moieties.|$|E
25|$|The Chichibabin {{pyridine}} synthesis {{was reported}} in 1924 and is still in use in industry. In its general form, the reaction {{can be described as}} a condensation reaction of aldehydes, ketones, α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, or any combination of the above, in ammonia or ammonia derivatives. In particular, unsubstituted pyridine is produced from formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, which are inexpensive and widely available. First, acrolein is formed in a Knoevenagel condensation from the acetaldehyde and formaldehyde. It is then condensed with acetaldehyde and ammonia into dihydropyridine, and then oxidized with a solid-state catalyst to pyridine. This process is carried out in a gas phase at 400–450°C. The product consists of a mixture of pyridine, simple methylated pyridines (picoline), and lutidine; its composition depends on the catalyst used and can be adapted {{to the needs of the}} manufacturer. The catalyst is usually <b>a</b> <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> salt such as cadmium(II) fluoride or manganese(II) fluoride, but cobalt and thallium compounds can also be used.
