50|$|As the {{transmission}} brake is mounted inboard {{of the final}} drive and its reduction gearing, the brake rotates relatively faster, but with less torque, than a wheel brake. The apparently undersized transmission brake thus has more holding ability than its small size might suggest, but is less suitable for driving loads. The braking forces would also be passed through the final drive and <b>axle</b> <b>drive</b> shafts, with possible risk of overloading them.|$|E

50|$|The Mercedes-Benz L3000 was a 4x2 3-ton rear <b>axle</b> <b>drive</b> truck used by Germany in World War II, {{powered by}} a Daimler-Benz OM 65/4 74 hp 4-cylinder diesel engine. It was used {{alongside}} the Opel Blitz, and proved even more reliable in rough terrain; and was used in all fronts and extensively by the Afrika Korps. It was manufactured in three versions, the L3000, the L3000A, and the L3000S, from 1938 to 1943; by that time more than 27,700 of all versions had been built. This made it the most produced Mercedes-Benz truck of World War II.|$|E
50|$|Later this {{pony truck}} {{arrangement}} was also {{adopted by the}} DRG standard locomotives (Einheitslokomotive) of the Deutsche Reichsbahn, e.g. on the ten-coupled classes: 44, 45, 50 and 85.

Because there were fewer elements of <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> housing model based on shell element, the amount of final calculation was less.

5000|$|The {{other key}} {{component}} in the transmission is a transfer case incorporating the torque-splitter, located between the main gear box and the tandem axle. This apportiones the torque from the gearbox between the front axle and the driven rear axle. The torque-splitter incorporates a two-step reduction gear and a longitudinal differential. The splitter was available in two versions, featuring slightly different low speed ratios. The [...] "AVV" [...] model provides the vehicle with slow ratio of 2.48:1 whereas the [...] "AVD" [...] provides a ratio of 2.47:1. Using the slow ratio also engages the front <b>axle</b> <b>drive.</b> The [...] "AVD" [...] uses a planetary gear that splits the torque in the ratio 23:77 between the front axle and the driven rear axle.|$|E
50|$|The unit {{itself is}} {{designed}} to independently divert the engine's power to either the axle-facing shaft or the additional PTO output shaft. This is done by two independent clutches like tooth or dog clutches which can be operated at total driveline standstill, only. Since the main gearbox changes the rotation speed by selection of a gear the PTO cannot be operated during driving. The vehicle needs to be stationary for operation therefore.On 4x4 vehicles only the rear drive shaft {{is used by the}} split shaft PTO gearbox requiring the vehicles 4x4 drive scheme to be of the selectable 4WD type to keep the front <b>axle</b> <b>drive</b> shaft completely decoupled during PTO operation.It is also possible to connect something other than a hydraulic pump directly to the PTO for example, fire truck pumps.|$|E

5000|$|Especially in steam days, wheel {{arrangement}} {{was an important}} attribute of a locomotive because there were {{many different types of}} layout adopted, each wheel being optimised for a different use (often with only some being actually [...] "driven").

50|$|Until {{the breakup}} of the former Czechoslovakia at the end of 1992, the 18 class members, and the TEŽ itself, were owned and {{operated}} by the Czechoslovak State Railways (ČSD). In service, their well proven three section articulated configuration allowed successful operation on the TEŽ's tight radius curves. Additionally, their all <b>axle</b> <b>drive</b> system enabled rapid acceleration and good traction, especially on uphill sections. On the other hand, the class did suffer from occasional derailments, leading to service interruptions. There were also problems with torn coupling bellows between the units, and the rubber insulating roof mats. In July 1981, due to delays in the delivery of replacements for worn tyres, all but four of the units had to be temporarily taken out of service, and replaced by road buses.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2012, Volvo {{announced}} that the first 1,000 units were sold out before the model year 2013 vehicles were delivered to the dealerships. The carmaker ramped up production of the 2014 model year to 5,000 units for 2013. [...] The first 1,000 units of the Volvo V60 Plug-in Hybrid {{were part of a}} [...] "Pure Limited" [...] edition with electric silver livery. The diesel-electric car also has aero-designed 17-inch wheels, integrated exhaust tailpipes and a number of bodywork features in glossy black.The V60 Plug-in Hybrid features a six-speed automatic transmission and the front wheels are driven by a five-cylinder 2.4-litre D5 turbo diesel, which produces 215 hp and maximum torque of 440 Nm. The rear axle features ERAD (Electric Rear <b>Axle</b> <b>Drive)</b> {{in the form of an}} electric motor producing 70 hp and maximum torque of 200 Nm, powered from a 12 kWh lithium-ion battery pack. Volvo expects to achieve an all-electric range of up to 50 km, and a fuel economy of 124 miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent (1.8 l/100 km), with carbon dioxide emissions averaging 49 g/km.The interaction between diesel and electric power is handled via a control system, and the driver has the option to choose the preferred driving mode via three buttons on the instrument panel: Pure, Hybrid and Power.|$|E
5000|$|Giacosa's next {{rear engine}} car for Fiat was the Nuova 500 of 1957, {{with a similar}} layout to the 600, but with a {{two-cylinder}} air-cooled engine instead of the water-cooled inline four-cylinder unit, and an unsynchronised 4-speed gearbox (the shortcomings of which being blunted by its own low inertial mass, plus that of the engine and entire vehicle), a layout kept for the entire lifespan of the model. Being a two/plus/two-seat car, it was the true replacement for the Topolino, {{at the bottom of}} the Fiat range. With a wheelbase fractionally over six feet and a length under nine feet, it was also a lightweight weighing less than five hundred kilograms. The [...] engines in the early production cars were so underpowered, with only , they were recalled and an uprated [...] engine fitted. The final 500F of 1965 had a [...] engine producing , sufficient to get to 110 km/h and a fuel consumption 20 km/l. In 1960 Fiat introduced the Giardiniera, a [...] station wagon with a similar inline twin-cylinder engine as the 500, but with cylinder horizontal. The engine was located under the floor at the rear of the car. With a slight increase in wheelbase and the weight increased to 570 kg, it was newer a four-seat car with a luggage area over the engine. In parallel with the Fiat models, the [...] "500", platforms where clothed in prettier bodies by Autobianchi at their Desio factory. Named the Bianchina, a convertible; a four-seat saloon, an estate, and a van on the Giardiniera platform were later added. A version of the Nuova 500 was made by Steyr-Puch in 1957, with their own boxer air-cooled engine and swing <b>axle</b> <b>drive</b> and suspension. The Steyr 650TR of 1965 to 1969 was the hottest 500 model made and a competent rally car.|$|E
50|$|<b>Drive</b> <b>axles</b> are MAN {{single tyre}} hub-reduction, {{and with the}} {{exception}} of the heavier tractor units which are full-time all-wheel drive for traction and torque distribution reasons, all models have selectable front <b>axle(s)</b> <b>drive.</b> All <b>axles</b> have cross-axle differential locks and there are longitudinal differential locks in rear (and front on 8×8 and 10x10 chassis) axle combinations and the transfer case. Axle weight ratings are 9000 kg or 11,000 kg for front axles, and 10,000 kg for rear axles with single wheels/tyres.|$|R
50|$|Heavier {{versions}} of tractor units, {{such as those}} used in heavy haulage and road trains, tend to have four or more axles, with more than two <b>axles</b> <b>driven.</b> In certain countries (such as Switzerland), {{a certain amount of}} weight must be spread over <b>driven</b> <b>axles,</b> which led to heavier varieties having six-wheel drive, otherwise another tractor unit would have to be used. Heavy haulage variants of tractor-units are often turned into a ballast tractor by fitting temporary ballast, which may require special permitting.|$|R
5000|$|A {{different}} {{alternative is}} to use electrical propulsion. Seattle in its Metro Bus Tunnel, and Boston in Phase II of its Silver Line are using this method in their BRTs.

Boston is using a similar approach, after initially using trolleybuses pending delivery of the dual-mode vehicles in 2005. In 2004, Seattle replaced its [...] "Transit Tunnel" [...] fleet with diesel-electric hybrid buses, which operate similarly to hybrid cars outside the tunnel and in a low-noise, low-emissions [...] "hush mode" [...] (in which the diesel engine operates but does not exceed idle speed) when underground.|$|R
