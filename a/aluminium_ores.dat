50|$|In 1886 Paul-Louis-Toussaint Héroult and Charles Martin Hall {{independently}} {{discovered a}} process for producing metallic <b>aluminium</b> from <b>aluminium</b> <b>ore</b> by electrolysis (Hall-Héroult process). In 1889 Paul-Louis-Toussaint Héroult, Gustave Naville, Georg Neher, and Peter Emil Huber established a company Aluminium Industrie Aktien Gesellschaft (AIAG) in Zurich, Switzerland to extract aluminium, creating the first aluminium production plant in Europe. It established plants in Neuhausen am Rheinfall in 1888, in Rheinfelden, Germany in 1898 and in Lend, Austria in 1899.|$|R

5000|$|Bauxite, an <b>aluminium</b> <b>ore,</b> is the world's {{main source}} of aluminium. It {{consists}} mostly of the minerals gibbsite (Al(OH)3), boehmite (γ-AlO(OH)) and diaspore (α-AlO(OH)), mixed with the two iron oxides goethite and haematite, the clay mineral kaolinite and small amounts of anatase (TiO2) and ilmenite (FeTiO3 or FeO.TiO2).

2500|$|Bauxite is an <b>aluminium</b> <b>ore</b> {{which is}} {{the main source of}} Aluminium.

While this deposit has been studied for the last 45 years and in 2008 Rio Tinto indicated both a mine and refinery were [...] "development projects," [...] it is not yet being mined, due in large part {{due to the lack of}} infrastructure in this part of Madagascar (100km north of Tolagnaro).|$|R
50|$|The Tajik {{aluminium}} smelting plant, TadAZ, in Tursunzoda, {{is the largest}} aluminium manufacturing plant in Central Asia, and possibly the world, and Tajikistan's chief industrial asset. The country has no native <b>aluminium</b> <b>ore,</b> so the raw material for the plant has to be imported. Construction of the plant proper began in 1972, and the first pouring of aluminium took place on March 31, 1975. It consumes 40% of the country's electrical power, and a 2002 study found it responsible for notable fluorine water pollution {{in the region and}} air pollution.|$|R
5000|$|Les Baux-de-Provence ( [...] ; Occitan: Lei Bauç de Provença) is a French commune in the Bouches-du-Rhône {{department}} of the province of Provence in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region of southern France. It has a spectacular position in the Alpilles mountains, set atop a rocky outcrop that is crowned with a ruined castle overlooking the plains to the south. Its name refers to its site: in Provençal, a bauç is a rocky spur. The name bauxite (<b>Aluminium</b> <b>ore)</b> {{is derived from the}} village name when it was first discovered there by geologist Pierre Berthier in 1821.|$|R
50|$|Boehmite or böhmite is an {{aluminium}} oxide hydroxide (γ-AlO(OH)) mineral, {{a component of}} the <b>aluminium</b> <b>ore</b> bauxite. It is dimorphous with diaspore. It crystallizes in the orthorhombic dipyramidal system and is typically massive in habit. It is white with tints of yellow, green, brown or red due to impurities. It has a vitreous to pearly luster, a Mohs hardness of 3 to 3.5 and a specific gravity of 3.00 to 3.07. It is colorless in thin section, optically biaxial positive with refractive indices of nα = 1.644 - 1.648, nβ = 1.654 - 1.657 and nγ = 1.661 - 1.668.|$|R
50|$|The mining {{industry}} of Guinea was developed during colonial rule, {{resulting in the}} improvement of the economic situation in the country. The minerals extracted consisted of iron, gold, diamond, and bauxite. Guinea ranks first in the world in bauxite reserves and 6th in the extraction of high-grade bauxite, the <b>aluminium</b> <b>ore.</b> The {{mining industry}} and exports of mining products accounted for 17% of Guinea’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010. Mining accounts for over 50% of exports. The country accounts for 94% of Africa’s mining of bauxite. The large mineral reserve, which has mostly remained untapped, is of immense interest for international firms.|$|R
50|$|Gumla {{district}} has rich natural and mineral resources. There are 23 bauxite mines and 68 stone mines in Gumla district. Besides these {{there is good}} number of brick makers. In Gumla District the important minerals like bauxite and laterite (<b>aluminium</b> <b>ore)</b> are found in villages of Amkipani, Langdatanr, Chirodih, Jalim, Narma, Bahagara and Gurdari of Bishunpur block, Langatanr, Lupungpat and Chota-Agiatu in Chainpur block and Harup, Serengdag and Jalim in Ghaghra block.

Other mining activities like stone crusher, Brick kiln and stone chip mining lease are also available in different part of the district.|$|R
50|$|Suriname's {{democracy}} {{gained some}} strength after the turbulent 1990s, and its economy became more diversified and {{less dependent on}} Dutch financial assistance. Bauxite (<b>aluminium</b> <b>ore)</b> mining {{continues to be a}} strong revenue source, and the discovery and exploitation of oil and gold has added substantially to Suriname's economic independence. Agriculture, especially rice and bananas, remains a strong component of the economy, and ecotourism is providing new economic opportunities. More than 80% of Suriname's land-mass consists of unspoiled rain forest; with the establishment of the Central Suriname Nature Reserve in 1998, Suriname signalled its commitment to conservation of this precious resource. The Central Suriname Nature Reserve became a World Heritage Site in 2000.|$|R
50|$|The smelter, {{located at}} Tiwai Point on the {{southern}} coast of the South Island, was opened in 1971 after a joint venture construction (50% Comalco, 25% Sumitomo Chemical Company and 25% Showa Denko KK). Comalco later purchased Showa Denko's share in April 1986. It {{is one of the}} 20 largest aluminium smelters in the world and, according to Rio Tinto Alcan, it provides NZ$3.65 billion worth of economic benefit to the New Zealand economy. It produces the world's highest purity primary (i.e. directly refined made from alumina <b>ore)</b> <b>aluminium.</b> The <b>ore</b> is mostly imported from Australia, while the finished product mostly goes to Japan.|$|R
50|$|The company {{operates}} three aluminium smelters in the US, {{and one in}} Iceland. Construction of a fifth smelter in Iceland {{has been}} halted since 2009. All Century's operations produce primary aluminium, that is, <b>aluminium</b> from <b>ore,</b> rather than from aluminum scrap. In 2014, the company produced 881,000 metric tons of aluminium.|$|R
50|$|Recycling {{involves}} melting the scrap, {{a process}} that requires only 5% of the energy used to produce <b>aluminium</b> from <b>ore,</b> though a significant part (up to 15% of the input material) is lost as dross (ash-like oxide). An aluminium stack melter produces significantly less dross, with values reported below 1%. The dross can undergo a further process to extract aluminium.|$|R
50|$|In 1988, alloys of lanthanum, <b>aluminium,</b> {{and copper}} <b>ore</b> {{were found to}} be highly glass-forming. Al-based {{metallic}} glasses containing Scandium exhibited a record-type tensile mechanical strength of about 1500 MPa.|$|R
50|$|The Hall-Héroult {{process is}} the major {{industrial}} process for smelting aluminium. It involves dissolving aluminium oxide (alumina) (obtained most often from bauxite, <b>aluminium's</b> chief <b>ore,</b> through the Bayer process) in molten cryolite, and electrolysing the molten salt bath, typically in a purpose-built cell. The Hall-Héroult process applied at industrial scale happens at 940-980°C and produces 99.5-99.8% pure aluminium. Recycled aluminum requires no electrolysis, thus it does not end up in this process.|$|R
50|$|The main {{industry}} is mining, {{with more than}} ten resources available within the county including quartz, stone, limestone, crystals, gold, silver, peat, zinc, <b>aluminium,</b> iron <b>ore,</b> kaolin, and manganese. Over 5 billion tonnes of quartz are still unmined in the county, with an average grade of 99.5% silicon. There are also nearly 11 million tonnes of limestone remaining in addition to crystal deposits 5.5 km long and 3 km wide and around 80,000,000 tonnes of kaolin.|$|R
