5|$|Complementary therapies {{have been}} {{investigated}} for treating people with acne. Low-quality evidence suggests topical application of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce {{the total number of}} skin lesions in those with acne. Tea tree oil is thought to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, but has been associated with <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> Proposed mechanisms for tea tree oil's anti-acne effects include antibacterial action against P. acnes, and anti-inflammatory properties. Numerous other plant-derived therapies have been observed to have positive effects against acne (e.g., basil oil and oligosaccharides from seaweed); however, few studies have been performed, and most have been of lower methodological quality. There is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of acupuncture, herbal medicine, or cupping therapy for acne.|$|E

25|$|Dermatitis is a {{group of}} skin {{conditions}} that includes atopic dermatitis, <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> irritant contact dermatitis, and stasis dermatitis. The exact cause of dermatitis is often unclear. Cases are believed to often involve a combination of irritation, allergy, and poor venous return. The type of dermatitis is generally determined by the person's history and the location of the rash. For example, irritant dermatitis often occurs on the hands of people who frequently get them wet. <b>Allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> however, can occur following brief exposures to substances a person is sensitive to.|$|E

25|$|The most {{prevalent}} response to latex is an <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> a delayed hypersensitive reaction appearing as dry, crusted lesions. This reaction usually lasts 48–96 hours. Sweating or rubbing the area under the glove aggravates the lesions, possibly leading to ulcerations. Anaphylactic reactions occur {{most often in}} sensitive patients who {{have been exposed to}} a surgeon's latex gloves during abdominal surgery, but other mucosal exposures, such as dental procedures, can also produce systemic reactions.|$|E
25|$|Triclosan {{has been}} {{associated}} with a higher risk of food allergy. This may be because exposure to bacteria reduces allergies, as predicted by the hygiene hypothesis, and not caused by toxicology of triclosan itself. This effect may also occur with chlorhexidine gluconate and PCMX, among other antibacterial agents. Other studies have linked triclosan to <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> in some individuals.

25|$|Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers {{can cause}} dry skin unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers {{are added to}} the formula. The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or {{eliminated}} by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula. In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents. <b>Allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol hand rubs rarely occur.

25|$|Methylisothiazolinone is used {{commonly}} {{in products}} {{in conjunction with}} methylchloroisothiazolinone, a mixture sold under the registered trade name Kathon CG. A common indication of sensitivity to Kathon CG is <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> Sensitization to this family of preservatives was observed {{as early as the}} late 1980s. Due to increased use of isothiazolinone-based preservatives in recent years, an increase in reported incidences of contact allergy to this product has been reported. In 2013 the substance was declared the 2013 Contact Allergen of the Year by the American Contact Dermatitis Society.

50|$|Vulvitis, {{inflammation}} of the vulva, can {{have a variety of}} etiologies in children and adolescents, including <b>allergic</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> lichen sclerosus, and infections with bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Dermatitis in infants is commonly caused by a soiled diaper being left on {{for an extended period of}} time. Increasing the frequency of diaper changes and topical application of emollients are sufficient to resolve most cases. Dermatitis of the vulva in older children is usually caused by exposure to an irritant (e.g. scented products that come into contact with the vulva, laundry detergent, soaps, etc.) and is treated with preventing exposure and encouraging sitz baths with baking soda as the vulvar skin heals. Other treatment options for vulvar dermatitis include oral hydroxyzine hydrochloride or topical hydrocortisone.|$|R

40|$|Occupational {{dermatitis}} among cement {{workers is}} a major occupational health concern. The two most important occupational hazards for cement workers are irritant and <b>allergic</b> cement <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the severity of occupational cement <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> and the common allergens among cement workers in Taiwan. Methods: A total of 97 cement workers from the Cement Workers’ Association of Tainan City and County participated in this study. A structured questionnaire was used to evaluate the demographic data and work-related activities of these cement workers. A complete skin examination was conducted, and skin manifestations were assessed by a dermatologist. Allergens from European Standard Tray (Chemotechnique Diagnostic AB, Sweden) with a total of 25 substances were used for patch testing. Results: Our results showed that 65 out of 97 cement workers were suffering from occupational cement hand <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> The most affected skin area was the hand. Thickening of the dorsal surface of the hand, especially around the metacarpophalangeal joint area, and hyperkeratosis of the palm were the major skin manifestations. The results of the patch test showed that 24 out of 97 were allergic to potassium dichromate, nine were allergic to thiuram mix, nine were allergic to fragrance mix and seven were allergic to cobalt chloride. The final diagnosis, based on the results of the skin examination and the patch test, showed that 43 of 97 cement workers had irritant cement <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> and 22 had <b>allergic</b> cement <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> Conclusion: We conclude that occupational cement hand dermatitis among cement workers is an important and severe issue in Taiwan, and the most common allergens among cement workers are potassium dichromate, thiuram mix, fragrance mix and cobalt chloride. The high positive rate of chromium hypersensitivity among cement workers reflects the urgency to regulate the addition of ferrous sulfate to cement in Taiwan...|$|R
25|$|Plasticized PVC is {{a common}} {{material}} for medical gloves. Due to vinyl gloves having less flexibility and elasticity, several guidelines recommend either latex or nitrile gloves for clinical care and procedures that require manual dexterity and/or that involve patient contact {{for more than a}} brief period. Vinyl gloves show poor resistance to many chemicals, including glutaraldehyde-based products and alcohols used in formulation of disinfectants for swabbing down work surfaces or in hand rubs. The additives in PVC are also known to cause skin reactions such as <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> These are for example the antioxidant bisphenol A, the biocide benzisothiazolinone, propylene glycol/adipate polyester and ethylhexylmaleate.|$|E
500|$|Chromium salts (chromates) {{are also}} the cause of {{allergic}} reactions in some people. Chromates are often used to manufacture, amongst other things, leather products, paints, cement, mortar and anti-corrosives.
