50|$|There are {{essentially}} {{two types of}} business overheads. <b>Administrative</b> <b>overheads</b> and manufacturing overheads.|$|E
50|$|Manufacturing {{overheads}} are {{all costs}} endured by {{a business that}} is within the physical platform in which the product or service is created. Difference between manufacturing overheads and <b>administrative</b> <b>overheads</b> is that manufacturing overheads are categorized within a factory or office in which the sale takes place. Whilst <b>administrative</b> <b>overheads</b> is typically categorized within some sort of back-office or supporting office. Although there are cases when the two physical buildings may overlap, it is the usage of the overheads that separates them.|$|E

50|$|The {{health care}} system in the U.S. has a vast number of players. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of {{insurance}} companies in the U.S. This system has considerable <b>administrative</b> <b>overhead,</b> far greater than in nationalized, single-payer systems, such as Canada's. An oft-cited study by Harvard Medical School and the Canadian Institute for Health Information determined that some 31% of U.S. health care dollars, or more than $1,000 per person per year, went to health care administrative costs, nearly double the <b>administrative</b> <b>overhead</b> in Canada, on a percentage basis.|$|R

50|$|Many {{companies}} provide {{usage of}} company cars as a perk for their employees. Since these cars do not contribute directly to sales and profits, {{they are considered}} an overhead. Similar company perks that are a one-off or constant payment such as partner contract fees with a gym will also fall under <b>administrative</b> <b>overheads.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Administrative</b> <b>overheads</b> include {{items such}} as utilities, {{strategic}} planning, and various supporting functions. These costs are treated as overheads {{due to the fact}} that they aren't directly related to any particular function of the organization nor does it directly result in generating any profits. Instead, these costs simply take on the role of supporting all of the business' other functions.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the methods}} of {{non-tariff}} regulation should be mentioned administrative and bureaucratic delays at the entrance, which increase uncertainty {{and the cost of}} maintaining inventory. For example, even though Turkey is in the European Customs Union, transport of Turkish goods to the European Union is subject to extensive <b>administrative</b> <b>overheads</b> that Turkey estimates cost it three billion euros a year.|$|E

50|$|It {{was based}} at Raymont Lodge in Auchenflower but {{effectively}} operated from this location and also concurrently at Saint Francis Theological College in Milton and Pius XII/ Saint Paul's Theological College at Banyo. The college offered both under-graduate and post-graduate qualifications. It ceased operations as an umbrella organisation {{for the three}} colleges in 2009, {{in part due to}} the <b>administrative</b> <b>overheads</b> involved in running a small tertiary institution in the Australian higher education system.|$|E
50|$|This {{includes}} {{office equipment}} such as printer, fax machine, computers, refrigerator, etc. They are equipments that do not directly result in sales and profits as they are only used for supporting functions that they can provide to business operations. However, equipments can vary between <b>administrative</b> <b>overheads</b> and manufacturing overheads based on the purpose {{of which they are}} using the equipments. For example, for a printing company a printer would be considered a manufacturing overhead.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the general}} concept is {{identical}} to the example under <b>administrative</b> <b>overheads,</b> the key difference {{is the role of the}} employee. In the case of manufacturing overheads, employees would have roles such as maintenance personnel, manufacturing managers, materials management staff, and quality control staff. It would also include the set wages for janitorial staff members. Once again, the key difference lies in the nature of their respective jobs and the physical location in which their jobs are carried out.|$|E

50|$|The {{downside}} {{of this approach}} is the server needs a different IP address for every web site.

50|$|Results {{of a study}} {{conducted}} at Gdańsk University of Technology suggest that deadlines given in university situations, including bonus and penalty points depending on when an assignment is handed in, tend to be harsh on {{students who are not}} well organised, even if the same code is submitted. This has mixed motivational effects on students, encouraging some to keep up with deadlines, while demotivating others. The same study indicates that use of online judge systems lead to a reduction in communication between students and staff. However, in the case of staff with high teaching load, this reduction may allow staff to devote more of their time to students with difficulties, eliminating <b>administrative</b> <b>overheads</b> related to grading and time spent on discussions with students who do not need assistance.|$|E
5000|$|Replacement is a strategy, where top {{managers}} or the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) {{are replaced by}} new ones. This turnaround strategy is used, because it is theorized that new managers bring recovery and a strategic change, {{as a result of}} their different experience and backgrounds from their previous work. [...] It is also indispensable to be aware, that new CEO’s can cause problems, which are obstructive to achieve a turnaround. For an example, if they change effective organized routines or introduce new <b>administrative</b> <b>overheads</b> and guidelines.Replacement is especially qualified for situations with opinionated CEO’s, which are not able to think impartial about certain problems. Instead they rely on their past experience for running the business or belittle the situation as short-termed. The established leaders fail therefore to recognize that a change in the business strategy is necessary to keep the company viable. There are also situations, where CEO’s do notice that a current strategy isn’t successful as it should be. But this hasn’t to imply, that they are capable or even qualified enough to accomplish a turnaround.Is a company against a Replacement of a leader, could this end in a situation, where the declining process will be continued. As result qualified employees resign, the organisation discredits and the resources left will run out as time goes by.|$|E
40|$|The {{non-distribution}} constraint of {{non-governmental organizations}} (NGOs) would be harder, and financiers {{as well as}} recipients could expect more charitable output from them, if less efficient NGOs were squeezed out of international development cooperation. We employ Probit and complementary log-log estimations to analyze which factors determine the probability of “market” exit for almost 900 US based NGOs with overseas aid activities during the 1984 - 2003 period. Apart from their size and experience, we consider <b>administrative</b> <b>overheads</b> as {{an important aspect of}} NGO efficiency. We also account for other dimensions of NGO heterogeneity, including the importance of official refinancing. We find that larger <b>administrative</b> <b>overheads</b> increase the probability of exit for secular NGOs, though not for religious NGOs. Furthermore, we detect complex non-linear effects once the interactions between <b>administrative</b> <b>overheads</b> and officia...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} is analysed between size, local government structure and <b>administrative</b> <b>overheads</b> in English local authorities. Size and structure effects are tested while controlling {{for a range}} of other variables, including the relative prosperity of the local population and the diversity of their service needs. The empirical results show that population size consistently has a linear negative effect: central administrative costs are lower in larger local authorities. The results also show that, controlling for size, <b>administrative</b> <b>overheads</b> are higher for councils in the lower tier of the existing two-tier system. The analysis provides support for arguments that economies of scale might be achieved by amalgamating smaller councils into larger units and by combining counties and districts into unitary authorities...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} SGFS- {{a secure}} global file sharing system. SGFS is designed based on important design requirements that include: efficiency for high performance data access, flexibility of cross-domain file sharing without administrative interference, support for flexible policies and off-the-shelf policy managers, {{ability to be}} deployed in diverse environments, ease of management and low <b>administrative</b> <b>overheads.</b> Unlike existing systems that satisfy a proper subset of these requirements, SGFS is designed to satisfy all of these requirements. In this paper, we present the architecture and design of SGFS. We illustrate how these requirements have influenced our design and present {{the implementation of the}} SGFS user-space prototype. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In a {{pervasive}} system {{it is essential}} to understand the intent of the user in order to predict his/her future behaviour. This in turn will help to minimise the user’s <b>administrative</b> <b>overheads</b> and assist the user to achieve his/her goals. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present some aspects of how user intent may be handled. It focuses on the architecture supporting the proactive features of the Persist pervasive platform. A formal definition of the task discovery problem in user intent is provided. The use of the discovered task model to predict the user’s next intended task/action is introduced including the way in which user context can assist in the prediction of the user’s intended task/action. 12...|$|E
50|$|One {{example from}} the UK of an {{unexpected}} or unintended consequence of government policy favouring direct share ownership, through some oversubscribed privatisation issues, was {{the holding of}} small parcels of shares by individuals numbered in millions.
