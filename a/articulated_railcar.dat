5000|$|The Alstom Coradia LINT is a single-unit or two-unit <b>articulated</b> <b>railcar</b> {{manufactured}} by Alstom, offered in diesel and hydrogen models. The acronym LINT {{is short for}} the German [...] "leichter innovativer Nahverkehrstriebwagen" [...] (light innovative local transport rail vehicle). It was designed by Linke-Hofmann-Busch (LHB) (acquired 1996 by Alstom) and has been distributed as part of Alstom’s Coradia family.|$|E

50|$|Classified {{as heavy}} rail {{according}} to UIC standards, the Talent is a two-, three- or four-part <b>articulated</b> <b>railcar</b> with Jacobs bogies. Partially {{as a result}} of this, the interior of an entire unit is essentially a single, long cabin; it is possible to see or walk from end to end without opening doors or passing through narrower gangways. The sharing of bogies also means that a Talent unit cannot be easily disassembled or rearranged without the assistance of a railway yard. In those variants whose floor is 590 mm above the rails, this means that the articulation floor is raised, but with ramp access, since it needs to be higher than the wheel diameter, above rail level. In the variants with 800 and 960 mm floor height, the floor is flat from the first door to the last. The endsections have a raised floor in all variants, because the traction equipment installed underneath requires more space than unpowered bogies.|$|E
50|$|Jacobs bogies (named after Wilhelm Jakobs, 1858-1942, a German railway engineer) are {{a type of}} {{rail vehicle}} bogie {{commonly}} found on <b>articulated</b> <b>railcars</b> and tramway vehicles.|$|R
50|$|In 1954-55, 35 <b>Articulated</b> <b>Railcars</b> NZR RM class (88 seater) were {{supplied}} to New Zealand Railways. Known unofficially as 'articulateds', 'Drewrys', or 'Fiats' or 'twinsets', they were powered by troublesome FIAT diesel engines.|$|R

50|$|Competing {{manufacturer}} Siemens Transportation Systems {{had been}} offering the Combino models with <b>articulated</b> <b>railcars</b> until some Combino construction flaws were observed. The new Avenio family of tram models features a double articulation join {{similar to the}} second generation of ADtranz low floor trams. These have already been sold to Budapest and Almada (Portugal).|$|R
5000|$|Initially, {{service was}} {{operated}} by five specially built two coach <b>articulated</b> <b>railcars</b> of class Bem550. These were built by Vevey Technologies (formerly Ateliers de Constructions Mécaniques de Vevey (ACMV)) with electrical equipment by Asea Brown Boveri in 1994. They ran under 1.5kV DC wires, but were {{equipped with a}} diesel engine {{to enable them to}} reach the workshops.|$|R
5000|$|Spurt (...) is a {{trade name}} used by Arriva Netherlands for certain {{passenger}} rail services operated in that country. The services are typically operated by Stadler GTW <b>articulated</b> <b>railcars.</b> The current Arriva fleet includes both 2-car (GTW 2/6) and 3-car (GTW 2/8) variants and both Electric and Diesel powered examples. Eight {{of the units}} are equipped for operation through to Leer in Germany.|$|R
50|$|When Bombardier Transportation bought Adtranz, it ceased {{production}} of the GTx-trams; however, the concept of <b>articulated</b> <b>railcars</b> for low floor trams was carried forward to its Incentro model, which was eventually replaced by Bombardier's standardized Flexity family of vehicles. Of these, the Flexity Berlin was specially designed with a layout similar to the Incentro and GTx-series and can {{be considered to be}} among its immediate successors. These trams entered revenue service in 2011.|$|R
2500|$|The {{commissioning}} in 1990 of five modern {{electric locomotives}} of type HGe 4/4 II allowed the gradual phasing {{out of the}} aged HGe 4/4 I locomotives. [...] Only locos no 15 and 16 remain as museum vehicles and reserves. [...] Further modernisation has taken place since 2003, with the purchase of low floored <b>articulated</b> <b>railcars</b> manufactured by Stadler. [...] From {{the time of their}} delivery in either 2003 or 2005, the first four BDSeh 4/8 railcars operated shuttle trains between Täsch and Zermatt. Five further examples of the ABDeh 4/8 and ABDeh 4/10 classes were to have entered traffic by 2008.|$|R
50|$|With the {{timetable}} change in December 2011, Ostdeutsche Eisenbahn (ODEG) took over {{operation of the}} Berlin-Wannsee-Jüterbog route. Class 646 (Stadler GTW) <b>articulated</b> <b>railcars</b> are used on the service, which was designated as OE33. Trains run over the whole line at hourly intervals from Monday to Friday, crossing in Treuenbrietzen, and every two hours on weekends. Also since December 2011, the RB 22 service has operated directly over the Berlin outer ring {{in preparation for the}} much-delayed opening of the Berlin Brandenburg Airport. The RB 23 (Potsdam Hauptbahnhof-Michendorf) service now runs on the Jüterbog-Nauen railway in the Caputh area.|$|R
5000|$|In 1951 Egyptian National Railways bought 10 <b>articulated</b> steam <b>railcars.</b> Each {{had three}} {{carriage}} bodies articulated over four bogies. One is preserved by the Quainton Railway Society at the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre, England.|$|R

50|$|As tourism {{increased}} in the 1970s the railway needed more capacity. In 1976 M&PPRy took delivery of two larger two-car <b>articulated</b> <b>railcars</b> from the Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works of Winterthur, designated Train 18 and Train 19. Passing sidings were built in several places {{at about the same}} time, allowing trains to pass at various points on the mountainside. Trains could previously pass only at the Mountain View siding, permitting only three trains a day up the mountain. Eight trains per day became possible with the new equipment and sidings (two additional larger railcars were delivered from SLM; Unit 24 in 1984 and the last, Unit 25, in 1989).|$|R
2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, road coaches {{could provide}} a similar service to the Vulcan and <b>articulated</b> 88-seater <b>railcars,</b> at much lower cost. The 88-seater railcars were also being phased out, despite being newer, because their {{operating}} and engine renewal costs could not be justified.|$|R
50|$|The company Hansa Waggonbau in Bremen {{had been}} {{among the first to}} {{introduce}} the concept of <b>articulated</b> <b>railcars</b> which was delivered to customers with the GT4 model since 1959. The fading interest in tram operation in the 1970s led to a bankruptcy of the company in 1975. Renewed interest in the concept sprang up in the late 1980s with Bremen and Munich to look for modernized versions of the GT type series. This included the wish for a low floor variant and all rail cars to be propelled. MAN took over the task to create a test model (number 561) in 1985 which had 3 units (instead of the 2 units of the GT4). The first model be on delivery (GT6N) was a three part electrical multiple unit (EMU) as well.|$|R
5000|$|The naming {{scheme is}} GTxN/M/S/K from German [...] (<b>articulated</b> {{propelled}} <b>railcar)</b> with x axles {{for a specific}} gauge ( [...] - standard gauge, [...] - meter gauge, [...] - narrow gauge, [...] - cape gauge). Delivered models include the standard-gauge version that was named GT6N or GT8N and the metre-gauge version that was called GT6M.|$|R
5000|$|In 1928 Palestine Railways {{bought two}} Sentinel-Cammell <b>{{articulated}}</b> steam <b>railcars</b> for local services. Each unit had two cars articulated over three bogies. Palestine Railways found the railcar format inflexible, as if passenger numbers exceeded {{the capacity of}} a train it was not practical to couple up an extra coach. In 1945 PR removed the Sentinel engines and converted the railcars to ordinary coaching stock.|$|R
5000|$|The service {{initially}} {{began in}} April 1954, using <b>articulated</b> DP class <b>railcars</b> built in 1949/50 by Commonwealth Engineering. Operating daily, Mondays to Saturdays, the railcars carried name-boards {{depending on their}} direction of travel: ...|$|R
50|$|In 1904 and 1905 the South Eastern & Chatham Railway {{purchased}} eight <b>articulated</b> steam <b>railcars</b> for the Sheppey Light Railway and the Hundred of Hoo Railway, seating 56 {{in third}} class. They were withdrawn in 1914, replaced by push-pull trains and SECR Class P 0-6-0 tanks. Between 1905 and 1907 the London & North Western Railway built six rigid steam railcars with a powered bogie {{that could be}} removed via double doors at the front end. Passenger accommodation was 48 in third class, the cars were fitted with electric lighting, and there was electric bell communication from the rear driving position and the footplate. All six were absorbed into the LMS fleet in 1923 and one, no. 3, survived to be nationalised, being withdrawn in February 1948. The Great Northern Railway (GNR) had eight railmotors built in 1905, two were petrol driven and unsuccessful and six were <b>articulated</b> steam <b>railcars.</b> Built in pairs by different manufacturers to compare performance, no further units were built. The six steam railcars were absorbed into the London & North Eastern Railway in the 1923 grouping and withdrawn between 1939 and 1948.|$|R
50|$|The Class 423 EMU is a {{light-weight}} <b>articulated</b> electric <b>railcar</b> for S-Bahn commuter {{networks in}} Germany. The train has similar dimensions to its predecessor, the Class 420 EMU, but is significantly lighter and has one large passenger compartment, while {{that of the}} 420 {{is divided into three}} parts. The 423 additionally has six doors in each carriage (three on each side), which is down from eight on the 420 (four on each side). They are numbered from 423 001 to 423 462.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, under CIÉ management, the West Clare Railway became {{a pioneer in}} the use of diesel traction. Passenger {{services}} were largely operated by four new <b>articulated</b> diesel <b>railcars,</b> built by Walker Brothers of Wigan, England (almost identical to units built for the County Donegal Railways). These were followed by three diesel locomotives (also built by Walkers). The use of diesel traction reduced operating costs, yet the investment in new rolling stock would largely be wasted by the early closure of the line.|$|R
5000|$|Rolling {{stock on}} the M&PPRy {{consists}} of four 214-passenger <b>articulated</b> Swiss-built <b>railcars,</b> four 78-passenger Swiss-built railcars, four GE built locomotives (one being rebuilt in 2017 to modern specifications), one snowplow (#22 - built upon the frame of a GE locomotive), one 23-passenger diesel railcar (#7), one steam locomotive (#4 - built by Baldwin), a Winter-Weiss [...] "streamliner" [...] coach, and an original Wasson wooden coach (#104). Only the Swiss-built railcars carry regular passengers. The steam locomotive and passenger coaches are used on rare special occasions.|$|R
2500|$|On 20 February 1956, the new <b>articulated</b> 88 seater <b>railcars</b> {{replaced}} the Vulcans on the Christchurch–Greymouth–Ross services. This allowed freed-up Vulcan railcars to provide daily Dunedin–Cromwell passenger services along the Otago Central Line (250 km or 155 miles) from 1 October 1956. [...] From 11 May 1958, the services were {{cut back to}} Dunedin–Alexandra (220 km or 136 miles) due to low passenger numbers beyond Alexandra.|$|R
50|$|Enfield, {{combining}} {{a contemporary}} designs of engine and carriage, was larger still. Built by Samuel and Adams this {{was used in}} regular service by the Eastern Counties Railway until the engine was converted into a 2-2-2 tank locomotive. More engine and carriage combinations to Samuel designs {{were built in the}} 1850s in the Eastern Counties railway works, and another by Kitson & Co. called Ariel's Girdle. Later, in 1869, Samuel, Robert Fairlie and George England collaborated to build a prototype <b>articulated</b> steam <b>railcar</b> at England's Hatcham Ironworks that was demonstrated in the works yard. However, England went out of business at about this time and nothing is known about the fate of this vehicle.|$|R
500|$|In 1905 the Great North {{introduced}} two <b>articulated</b> steam <b>railcars.</b> The locomotive {{unit was}} mounted on four [...] wheels, one pair driven {{and with the}} Cochran patent boiler that was common on stationary engines, but an unusual design for a locomotive. The saloon carriage accommodated 46 third class passengers on reversible lath-and-space seats and a position for the driver with controls using cables over the carriage roof. The cars were introduced on the Lossiemouth branch and the St Combs Light Railway, but when in motion there was considerable vibration that was uncomfortable for the passengers and caused problems for the steam engine. Before they were withdrawn in 1909–10, one was tried on Deeside suburban services, but had insufficient accommodation {{and was unable to}} maintain the schedule.|$|R
50|$|The rebuilt railway's revenue freight {{rolling stock}} {{consists}} of 5-well, <b>articulated,</b> double-stack container <b>railcars</b> with bulkheads. The 265-foot-long car sets were built by Gunderson Inc. and each car set can hold ten 40 foot containers. The bottom level in each well can hold two 20 foot containers {{instead of one}} 40 foot unit. The intermodal terminals at each end can accommodate trains of 11 of these cars, which carry a total of up to 110 forty-foot equivalent units (FEUs).|$|R
