40|$|We {{present a}} large-scale, {{airspace}} planning and collaborative decision-making model(APCDM) {{to enhance the}} management of the U. S. National Airspace System (NAS). Given a set of flights that must be scheduled during some planning horizon, along with alternative surrogate trajectories for each flight as prompted by various <b>airspace</b> <b>restriction</b> scenarios imposed by dynamic severe weather systems or space launch special use airspaces (SUA), we develop a mixed-integer programming model to select a set of flight plans from among these alternatives, subject to flight safety, air traffic control workload, and airline equity constraints. The model includes a three-dimensional probabilistic conflict analysis, the derivation of valid inequalities, the development of air traffic control workload metrics, and the consideration of equity among airline carriers in absorbing costs related to rerouting, delays, and possible cancellations. The resulting APCDM model has potential use for both tactical and strategic applications, such as air traffic control in response to severe weather phenomena or spacecraft launches, FAA policy evaluation (separation standards, workload restrictions, sectorization strategies), Homeland Defense contingency planning, and military air campaign planning. The model can also serve a useful role in augmenting the FAA’s National Playbook of standardized flight profiles in different disruption-prone regions of the national airspace.

40|$|Air {{route network}} optimization, {{one of the}} {{essential}} parts of the airspace planning, is {{an effective way to}} optimize airspace resources, increase airspace capacity, and alleviate air traffic congestion. However, little has been done on the optimization of air route network in the fragmented airspace caused by prohibited, restricted, and dangerous areas (PRDs). In this paper, an air route network optimization model is developed with the total operational cost as the objective function while <b>airspace</b> <b>restriction,</b> air route network capacity, and non-straight-line factors (NSLF) are taken as major constraints. A square grid cellular space, Moore neighbors, a fixed boundary, together with a set of rules for solving the route network optimization model are designed based on cellular automata. The empirical traffic of airports with the largest traffic volume in each of the 9 flight information regions in mainland China is collected as the origin-destination (OD) airport pair demands. Based on traffic patterns, the model generates 35 air routes which successfully avoids 144 PRDs. Compared with the current air route network structure, the number of nodes decreases by 41. 67 %, while the total length of flight segments and air routes drop by 32. 03 % and 5. 82 % respectively. The NSLF decreases by 5. 82 % with changes in the total length of the air route network. More importantly, the total operational cost of the whole network decreases by 6. 22 %. The computational results show the potential benefits of the model and the advantage of the algorithm.

I don't consider {{that any of the}} questions posed have yet been answered adequately. The Situation Suppose my customer has a large area of ground for critical infrastructure, say a square kilometer, which she wishes to maintain under constant surveillance with video and infrared sensing. The spatial geometry of the area with its structures is complex enough that fixed-base surveillance is impractical; also she judges that potential attackers could too easily survey and selectively disable ground-based sensing. She has decided for aerial surveillance and obtained the necessary <b>airspace</b> <b>restriction,</b> <b>airspace</b> over her domain, extending a further half kilometer beyond the boundary in each direction, in which flight is prohibited, except for her surveillance devices, under 2, 500 ft altitude. This infrastructure lies in a built-up area (it didn't when it was originally built, but the city has grown up around it) and includes containers holding dangerous bioactive substances that must not be released into the atmosphere. She has bought aircraft which were originally personal transports but have been modified as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a variant of the proven-in-use automated flight systems (AFS) of the Boeing 737, the world's most highly-flown jet airliner, with of course the flight parameters adjusted for the rather smaller, slower surveillance vehicle. The autothrottle of this airliner has a mode called RETARD, into which it passes when the aircraft is to flare on landing. In RETARD mode, the autothrottle closes the throttles to idle. Its sensors are radio altimeters (also known as radar altimeters), RAs. The Boeing 737 slaves the autothrottle to just one RA, but since RAs are not sufficiently reliable, three are included in the drone and a 2 oo 3 voting module has been added to the autothrottle software. This modification is similar to what some safety experts suggested after the Turkish Airline...|$|R

5000|$|A {{holding pattern}} for {{instrument}} flight rules (IFR) aircraft {{is usually a}} racetrack pattern based on a holding fix. This fix can be a radio beacon such as a non-directional beacon (NDB) or VHF omnidirectional range (VOR). The fix {{is the start of}} the first turn of the racetrack pattern. Aircraft will fly towards the fix, and once there will enter a predefined racetrack pattern. A standard holding pattern uses right-hand turns and takes approximately 4 minutes to complete (one minute for each 180 degree turn, and two one-minute straight ahead sections). [...] Deviations from this pattern can happen if long delays are expected; longer legs (usually two or three minutes) may be used, or aircraft with distance measuring equipment (DME) may be assigned patterns with legs defined in nautical miles rather than minutes.

The resulting ability to interoperate with air traffic control systems around the world supports the USAF’s global, multi-faceted mission, but entails great expense in on-board equipage and training. It {{is important to understand}} the trade-offs that the USAF must make in assessing the value of specific CNS/ATM capabilities. In this paper, we describe a model-driven analysis to assess mission effectiveness. The analysis is accomplished via a five-step process involving military route generation, simulation of the civilian airspace activity, simulation of delay events for military flights, and evaluation of several figures of merit. The software modules used for these activities were a combination of existing packages and some newly-developed programs. The analysis accounts for planned USAF CNS/ATM capabilities by aircraft type, as well as any <b>airspace</b> and operational <b>restrictions</b> that might be encountered in specific geographic regions when the aircraft does not have the required capabilities.

40|$|In {{order to}} ensure that the safe {{capacity}} of the terminal area is not exceeded, Air Traffic Management ATM often places restrictions on arriving flights transitioning from en route airspace to terminal <b>airspace.</b> This <b>restriction</b> of arrival traffic is commonly referred to as arrival flow management, and includes techniques such as metering, vectoring, fix-load balancing, and the imposition of miles-in-trail separations. These restrictions are enacted without regard for the relative priority which airlines may be placing on individual flights based on factors such as crew criticality, passenger connectivity, critical turn times, gate availability, on-time performance, fuel status, or runway preference. The development of new arrival flow management techniques which take into consideration priorities expressed by air carriers will likely reduce the economic impact of ATM restrictions on the airlines and lead to increased airline economic efficiency by allowing airlines to have greater control over their individual arrival banks of aircraft. NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have designed and developed a suite of software decision support tools (DSTs) collectively known as the Center TRACON Automation System (CTAS). One of these tools, the Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) is currently being used at the Fort Worth Air Route Traffic Control Center to perform arrival flow management of traffic into the Dallas/Fort Worth airport (DFW). The TMA is a time-based strategic planning tool that assists Traffic Management Coordinators (TMCs) and En Route Air Traffic Controllers in efficiently balancing arrival demand with airport capacity. The primary algorithm in the TMA is a real-time scheduler which generates efficient landing sequences and landing times for arrivals within about 200 no a. from touchdown. This scheduler will sequence aircraft so that they arrive in a first- come - first-served (FCFS) order. While FCFS sequencing establishes a fair order based on estimated times of arrival, it {{does not take into account}} individual airline priorities among incoming flights. NASA is exploring the possibility of allowing airlines to express relative arrival priorities to air traffic management through the development of new CTAS scheduling algorithms which take into consideration airline arrival preferences. The accommodation of airline priorities in arrival sequencing and scheduling would under most circumstances result in a deviation from a "natural" or FCFS arrival order. As a First step toward developing airline influenced sequencing algorithms, an investigation was conducted to determine the feasibility of reordering arrival traffic from a strict FCFS sequence. A fast-time simulation has been developed which allows statistical evaluation of sequencing and scheduling algorithms for arrival traffic at the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport. In contrast to real-time simulation or field tests, which would require on the order of ninety minutes to examine a single traffic rush period, the fast-time simulation allows examination of multiple rush periods in a matter of seconds...|$|R
