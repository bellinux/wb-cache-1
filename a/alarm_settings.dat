50|$|Clock radios are {{powered by}} AC {{power from the}} wall socket. In {{the event of a}} power interruption, older {{electronic}} digital models used to reset the time to midnight (00:00) and lose <b>alarm</b> <b>settings.</b> This would cause failure to trigger the alarm even if the power is restored. To solve this issue, they trigger the alarm at 00:01 after a reset, so that at least the user is able to correct the clock and <b>alarm</b> <b>settings.</b> Most of the recent clock radios use a battery backup to maintain the time and <b>alarm</b> <b>settings.</b> Some advanced radio clocks (not to be confused with clocks with AM/FM radios) have a feature which sets the time automatically using signals from atomic clock-synced time signal radio stations such as WWV, making the clock accurate and immune to time reset due to power interruptions.|$|E

Reality Miners can also use biometric devices to measure physical health and activity. There are many devices like this as the Fitbit, Nike+, and Polar and Garmin GPS watches. There is even an app called Sleep Cycle for iPhone and Android users that measures sleep quality, which includes the amount of sleep and even optimal <b>alarms</b> <b>settings.</b> Using this data, Reality Miners may be able to measure one's actual health and processes that allow to function (or dysfunction). Heart attacks generally don't have any longitudinal indicators, but using all this data or even when a person engages in Lifelogging can create useful data to the medical field and track the lifestyles of those who undergo heart attacks to then create preventative guidelines. There are several ways to start Lifelogging, Google has its own device called Google Glass that has a Heads-Up-Display (HUD), a microphone, a processor, and a camera.

5000|$|The {{constant}} {{sounds of}} alarms and noises from blood pressure machines, ventilators and heart monitors causes a [...] "tuning out" [...] {{of the sounds}} due to the brain adjusting to stimulation. This issue is present in hospitals, in home care providers, nursing homes and other medical facilities alike. The Joint Commission's sentinel event reports 80 alarm-related deaths and 13 alarm-related serious injuries {{over the course of}} a few years. On April 18, 2013, the Joint Commission issued a sentinel event alert that highlighted the widespread problem of alarm fatigue in hospitals. Their recommendations included establishing guidelines to tailor <b>alarm</b> <b>settings,</b> training all members of the clinical team on safe use of alarms, and sharing information about alarm-related incidents. This alert resulted in designation in 2014 of clinical alarm system safety as a National Patient Safety Goal and it remains a goal in 2017. This Goal will force hospitals to establish alarm safety as a priority, identify the most important alarms, and establish policies to manage alarms by January 2016.

40|$|Intensive {{care unit}} (ICU) {{monitors}} have alarm options to intimate {{the staff of}} critical incidents but these alarms needs to be adjusted in every patient. With this objective in mind, this study was done among resident doctors, {{with the aim of}} assessing the existing attitude among resident doctors towards ICU <b>alarm</b> <b>settings.</b> This study was conducted among residents working at ICU of a multispeciality centre, {{with the help of a}} printed questionnaire. The study involved 80 residents. All residents were in full agreement on routine use of ECG, pulse oximeter, capnograph and NIBP monitoring. 86 % residents realised the necessity of monitoring oxygen concentration, apnoea monitoring and expired minute ventilation monitoring. 87 % PGs and 70 % SRs routinely checked alarm limits for various parameters. 50 % PGs and 46. 6 % SRs set these alarm limits. The initial response to an alarm among all the residents was to disable the alarm temporarily and try to look for a cause. 92 % of PGs and 98 % of SRs were aware of alarms priority and colour coding. 55 % residents believed that the alarm occurred due to patient disturbance, 15 % believed that alarm was due to technical problem with monitor/sensor and 30 % thought it was truly related to patient’s clinical status. 82 % residents set the alarms by themselves, 10 % believed that alarms should be adjusted by nurse, 4 % believed the technical staff should take responsibility of setting alarm limits and 4 % believed that alarm levels should be pre-adjusted by the manufacturer. We conclude that although alarms are an important, indispensable, and lifesaving feature, they can be a nuisance and can compromise quality and safety of care by frequent false positive alarms. We should be familiar of the alarm modes, check and reset the <b>alarm</b> <b>settings</b> at regular interval or after a change in clinical status of the patient...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Physiologic {{monitors}} are {{plagued with}} alarms {{that create a}} cacophony of sounds and visual alerts causing "alarm fatigue" which creates an unsafe patient environment because a life-threatening event may be missed in this milieu of sensory overload. Using a state-of-the-art technology acquisition infrastructure, all monitor data including 7 ECG leads, all pressure, SpO(2), and respiration waveforms as well as user settings and alarms were stored on 461 adults treated in intensive care units. Using a well-defined alarm annotation protocol, nurse scientists with 95 % inter-rater reliability annotated 12, 671 arrhythmia alarms. RESULTS: A total of 2, 558, 760 unique alarms occurred in the 31 -day study period: arrhythmia, 1, 154, 201; parameter, 612, 927; technical, 791, 632. There were 381, 560 audible alarms for an audible alarm burden of 187 /bed/day. 88. 8 % of the 12, 671 annotated arrhythmia alarms were false positives. Conditions causing excessive alarms included inappropriate <b>alarm</b> <b>settings,</b> persistent atrial fibrillation, and non-actionable events such as PVC's and brief spikes in ST segments. Low amplitude QRS complexes in some, but not all available ECG leads caused undercounting and false arrhythmia alarms. Wide QRS complexes due to bundle branch block or ventricular pacemaker rhythm caused false alarms. 93 % of the 168 true ventricular tachycardia alarms were not sustained long enough to warrant treatment. DISCUSSION: The excessive number of physiologic monitor alarms is a complex interplay of inappropriate user settings, patient conditions, and algorithm deficiencies. Device solutions should focus on use of all available ECG leads to identify non-artifact leads and leads with adequate QRS amplitude. Devices should provide prompts to aide in more appropriate tailoring of <b>alarm</b> <b>settings</b> to individual patients. Atrial fibrillation alarms {{should be limited to}} new onset and termination of the arrhythmia and delays for ST-segment and other parameter alarms should be configurable. Because computer devices are more reliable than humans, an opportunity exists to improve physiologic monitoring and reduce alarm fatigue...|$|E
40|$|Nuisance {{scenario}} {{tests were}} {{performed in the}} manufactured home used in the Home Smoke Alarm fire test series. The scenario selections were based on what are commonly thought to be causes of residential nuisance alarms, and were designed to mimic normal activities (i. e. no intentional food burning, {{with the exception of}} toasted bread.) The bulk of the scenarios were related to cooking activities including: frying, deep-frying, baking, broiling, boiling, and toasting. In addition, cigarette smoking and candle burning were included. Smoldering fire scenarios were examined for comparative purposes. Aerosol concentrations, temperature, humidity, flow velocity and analog output from several photoelectric, ionization and carbon monoxide sensors were gathered. It was observed that nuisance <b>alarms</b> in residential <b>settings</b> were affected by the properties of the aerosol produced, its concentration, the location of an alarm relative to the source, and the air flow that transports smoke to an alarm.

40|$|Data {{from two}} {{full-scale}} residential smoke alarm fire test series were analyzed {{to estimate the}} performance of dual sensor photoelectric/ionization alarms as compared to co-located individual photoelectric and ionization alarms. Dual alarms and aggregated photoelectric and ionization alarm responses were used to estimate dual alarm performance. It was observed that dual alarms with equivalent or higher sensitivity settings performed better than individual photoelectric or ionization alarms over a range of flaming and smoldering fire scenarios. In one test series, dual alarms activated 539 s faster than ionization alarms and 79 s faster than photoelectric alarms on average. In another test series, individual alarm sensor outputs were calibrated against a reference smoke source in terms of light obscuration over a path length (percent smoke obscuration per unit length) so that alarm thresholds could be defined by the sensor outputs. In that test series, dual alarms, with individual sensor sensitivities equal to their counterpart alarm sensitivities, activated 261 s faster on average than ionization <b>alarms</b> (with sensitivity <b>settings</b> of 4. 3 %/m smoke obscuration for the ionization sensors) and 35...|$|R
40|$|In modern {{industrial}} processes, it {{is easier}} and less expensive to configure <b>alarms</b> by software <b>settings</b> rather than by wiring, which causes {{the rapid growth of}} the number of alarms. Moreover, because there exist complex interactions, in particular the causal relationship among different parts in the process, a fault may propagate along propagation pathways once an abnormal situation occurs, which brings great difficulty to operators to identify its root cause immediately and to take proper actions correctly. Therefore, causality detection becomes a very important problem in the context of multivariate alarm analysis and design. Transfer entropy has become an effective and widely-used method to detect causality between different continuous process variables in both linear and nonlinear situations in recent years. However, such conventional methods to detect causality based on transfer entropy are computationally costly. Alternatively, using binary alarm series can be more computational-friendly and more direct because alarm data analysis is straightforward for alarm management in practice. The methodology and implementation issues are discussed in this paper. Illustrated by several case studies, including both numerical cases and simulated industrial cases, the proposed method is demonstrated to be suitable for industrial situations contaminated by noise...|$|R

30|$|Both {{subjective}} and objective {{studies have reported}} noise as a primary source of sleep disturbance, with staff being {{the primary source of}} the generated noise [15, 16, 75]. Subjective studies investigating the impact of noise on sleep indicate that ICU patients identify the exposure to noise and inability to sleep as a major stressor recounted by patients. Further, objective studies indicate that the noise generated with within the environment is not conducive to the ability to sleep. The primary source of noise within the clinical environment has been attributed to staff behaviours, which Kahn et al. [76] reported accounted for greater than 50 % of noise sources with an average noise level of 84 dB. Previous studies have suggested that the disruptive nature of staff behaviours evolve from the propensity of staff to deprioritized sleep, due to patients being intubated and sedated, and lacked knowledge regarding the psychophysiological effects of sleep deprivation [70, 77]. As a result of subjective studies, behaviour modification strategies have been widely investigated as a means to curtail the impact of noise generated by staff on patient sleep and have been cited as being successful in reducing noise levels by 6 % to 20 % [78 - 80]. These behaviour modification activities have primarily involved an educational approach to enhance staff awareness of the impact their behaviours have in contributing to noise levels and promoting reductions in <b>alarm</b> volume <b>settings</b> to promote a diurnally appropriate environment. However, these studies have employed subjective assessments of the impact of behaviour modification, such as clinical staff perception of nocturnal noise, as opposed to using an objective environmental measure of noise. This has been problematic as studies that have employed environmental noise monitoring to determine the effect of behaviour modification on noise have been unable to achieve a measurable reduction in noise levels [81]. Furthermore, achieving sustainable change in the clinical environment has not been extensively investigated as behaviour modification studies have been undertaken over short durations, with follow-up assessments conducted after the immediate intervention period.|$|R

Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS version 10. Test of significance were calculated using chi-square test. Results: During the study period, 1137 / 2840 (40 %) of the isolates tested {{were found to be}} ESBL producing. ESBL positivity was detected in 50 % Enterobacter sp., 41 % E. coli and 36 % K. pneumoniae. ESBL production was noted in 52 % of nosocomial isolates tested (415 / 799). ESBL was more frequent in patients at the extremes of ages (under 5 years and more than 60 years). Cross-resistance to non-beta lactam antibiotics (flouoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and co-trimoxazole) was also more frequent in ESBL producing organisms Conclusion: A high frequency of ESBL positivity amongst our isolates is documented which is <b>alarming</b> in low-income <b>settings</b> where expensive second line agents are unavailable.

40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this project}} is to {{implement}} interventions to reduce alarm fatigue in the hospital environment. Background. Alarms in the hospital settings may create {{a false sense of}} security. Advancement in healthcare technology generate devices producing valuable information with the intent to serve as warning signs for the bedside clinician. The overwhelming amount of devices in clinical areas compiled with alarm triggers that require no action can create a noisy environment in which clinicians become disengaged to alarm alerts. The Joint Commission hospital national patient safety goal for 2016 calls for the improvement of the clinical alarm system to reduce patient harm. Methods. The review of 895 articles relating to <b>alarms</b> in clinical <b>settings</b> were appraised, and the interventions focused on the reduction of alarm fatigue were chosen for implementation in the hospital. Results. The review of the evidence-based literature has provided suggestions for interventions. The most feasible interventions for reduction or elimination of alarm fatigue were proposed for the hospitalwide initiative. The project provides education for the nursing staff and formation of interdisciplinary committees to establish protocols for alarms management. Conclusion. A project highlighted possible critical events caused by alarm fatigue and offered initiatives to reduce alarm fatigue. The alarm management requires a collaborative approach between clinicians, biomedical engineers, device manufacturers, and hospitals.

To {{understand the relationship between}} heart rate (HR) alarms and adjustments to reduce unnecessary heart rate alarms. Retrospective, quantitative analysis of an adjudicated database using analytical approaches to understand behaviors surrounding parameter HR alarm adjustments. Patients were sampled from five adult ICUs (77 beds) over one month at a quaternary care university medical center. A total of 337 of 461 ICU patients had HR alarms with 53. 7 % male, mean age 60. 3 years, and 39 % non-Caucasian. Default HR alarm parameters were 50 and 130 beats per minute (bpm). The occurrence of each alarm, vital signs, and physiologic waveforms was stored in a relational database (SQL server). There were 23, 624 HR alarms for analysis, with 65. 4 % exceeding the upper heart rate limit. Only 51 % of patients with HR alarms had parameters adjusted, with a median upper limit change of + 5 bpm and - 1 bpm lower limit.

This thesis tests and compares two wireless systems and analyses which one best fits Royal Perth Hospital’s requirements. Thorough testing and comparison was required because once installed, the selected solution was required to be the main monitoring system used in the future. From there the selected system was installed and commissioned within the Pre-Treatment Plant of Haemodialysis. Commissioning of the chosen software entailed configuring the manufacturers Web Server with required sensor <b>settings,</b> <b>alarm</b> limits and email addresses. In addition to the installation, this thesis briefly investigates the possibility of a fully automated chlorine analyser for the Pre-Treatment Plant. This would create an excellent long term logging solution with the nurses no longer needing to hand test chlorine levels each day. Although the Web Server satisfied the hospitals needs in the short term, a longer term solution needed to be found. Perl script was created to communicate from the Web Servers data tables to Royal Perth Hospitals’ server. This script was able to transfer all required data and pass it through to the new server, Fully Automated Nagios. This new script allows for improved data viewing, emailing capabilities, and longer term data storage. This thesis summarises the work required to install, commission and configure a system that monitors pressures, temperature and contact switches, as well as educate the reader on the development, implementation and testing of such a system.

40|$|UNLABELLED: During {{oxygen therapy}} in preterm infants, {{targeting}} oxygen saturation {{is important for}} avoiding hypoxaemia and hyperoxaemia, but this can be very difficult and challenging for neonatal nurses. We systematically reviewed the qualitative and quantitative studies investigating the compliance in targeting oxygen saturation in preterm infants and factors that influence this compliance. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, CINAHL and ScienceDirect from 2000 to January 2015. Sixteen studies were selected, which involved a total of 2935 nurses and 574 infants. The studies varied in methodology, and we have therefore used a narrative account to describe the data. The main finding {{is that there is}} a low compliance in oxygen targeting; the upper alarm limits are inappropriately set, and maintaining the saturation (SpO 2) below the upper limit presented particular difficulties. Although there is little data available, the studies indicate that training, titration protocols and decreasing workload could improve awareness and compliance. Automated oxygen regulations have been shown to increase the time that SpO 2 is within the target range. CONCLUSION: The compliance in targeting oxygen during oxygen therapy in preterm infants is low, especially in maintaining the SpO 2 below the upper limit. WHAT IS KNOWN: • The use of oxygen in preterm infants is vital, but the optimal strategyremains controversial. • Targeting SpO 2 during oxygen therapy in preterm infants has beenshown to reduce mortality and morbidity. WHAT IS NEW: • Review of the literature showed that the compliance in targeting SpO 2 and <b>alarm</b> <b>settings</b> is low. • Creating awareness of risks of oxygen therapy and benefits in targeting,decreasing nurse/patient ratio and automated oxygen therapy couldincrease compliance...|$|E
40|$|The Stepwise Stress Model (SSM) {{states that}} {{a cascade of}} regulative {{behavioral}} responses with different intrinsic sensitivities and threshold values offers increased behavioral plasticity and thus {{a wider range of}} tolerance for environmental changes or pollutant exposures. We tested the SSM with a widely introduced fish Gambusia holbrooki (Girard) (Pisces, Poeciliidae) and the standard laboratory test species Daphnia magna Straus (Crustacea, Daphniidae). The stress was simulated by short-term exposure to acid mine drainage (AMD) and to acidified reference water (ACID). Recording of behavioral responses with the multispecies freshwater biomonitor (MFB) generated continuous time-dependent dose-response data that were modeled in three-dimensional (313) surface plots. Both the pH-dependent mortalities and the strong linear correlations between pH and aqueous metals confirmed the toxicity of the AMD and ACID gradients, respectively, for fish and Daphnia, the latter being more sensitive. AMD stress at pH <= 5. 5 amplified circadian rhythmicity in both species, while ACID stress did so only in G. holbrooki. A behavioral stepwise stress response was found in both species: D. magna decreased locomotion and ventilation (first step) (AMD, ACID), followed by increased ventilation (second step) (AMD). G. holbrooki decreased locomotion (first step) (AMD, ACID) and increased ventilation at intermediate pH levels (second step) (AMD). Both species, although from different taxonomic groups and feeding habits, followed the SSM, which might be expanded to a general concept for describing the behavioral responses of aquatic organims to pollution.

40|$|Toxic {{exposure}} to hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is a well-recognized hazard in agriculture, particularly in livestock operations that manage {{large amounts of}} manure. Numerous fatalities have been observed, often multiple fatalities in a single incident, due to toxic {{exposure to}} H 2 S from manure pits at concentrations higher than 500 ppm. Direct-reading instruments that alarm workers in the areas when H 2 S concentrations are high may prevent these fatalities. However, monitors that are commonly found in industries with robust safety programs are impractical for agricultural use as they are often prohibitively expensive and require regular maintenance and calibration that may be above the expertise level of agricultural workers. In more recent years, manufacturers marketed simpler models of direct-reading H 2 S monitors as “low-maintenance” or “maintenance-free” {{at a much lower}} cost than traditional monitors, which may cost $ 500 for basic models or more than $ 1000 for more complex models. The objective {{of this study was to}} test several models of low-cost, low-maintenance monitors in order to examine the features of each for comparison, as well as to test the performance of these monitors with no maintenance over time while under constant exposure to low levels of H 2 S. Two types of monitors were examined: qualitative monitors that were lowest-cost (around $ 100) and provided only <b>alarm</b> <b>settings</b> with no concentration displayed (Honeywell BW Clip and MSA Altair), and quantitative monitors that cost slightly more (around $ 200) but displayed concentration readings (Dräger Pac 3500 and Industrial Scientific T 40 Rattler). All models were exposed to H 2 S for a test period of 4 months, at concentrations slightly higher than typical background concentrations to simulate expected monitor exposure for a year in a barn. The performance of qualitative (‘alarm-only’) monitors declined faster than over the course of the simulated barn year than the quantitative monitors, with both models of qualitative meters failing to alarm at the high setting before the test period was complete. The quantitative (‘concentration-display’) models showed fewer effects from long-term exposure over the duration of testing, but both models exhibited inaccuracies in the concentration readings when compared to calibration gas concentrations. The T 40 Rattler provided consistently higher readings (+ 2. 3 ppm) than the calibration gas concentration, while the Pac 3500 showed consistently lower readings (- 3. 4 ppm) than the calibration gas concentration. Serious acute health effects for H 2 S are not typically observed until exposure to concentrations above 500 ppm, so inaccuracies of this small magnitude are relatively insignificant. Though each of the test monitors is advertised to be maintenance-free for two years, this study found that failures occurred within one simulated year in a barn. Bump checks should be performed regularly to ensure the monitor reacts to the presence of H 2 S appropriately, even when the manufacturer’s literature may say otherwise. Most importantly, agricultural workers should always inspect and bump check these monitors prior to any potentially high-risk activity such as manure agitation or pumping to ensure that the monitor is still providing the protection needed from a potentially toxic release of H 2 S. This study tested each of these models within a clean chamber at room temperature to isolate the effects of long-term exposure to H 2 S. In an actual barn, these monitors may be exposed to variations in temperature and humidity, as well as other barn contaminants such as ammonia, dust, and chemicals. Each of these other exposures could also affect the performance of these monitors over time, and should be considered when storing and using these monitors. Furthermore, the potential interactions from other exposures is an opportunity for future study to better understand how these interactions may affect sensor performance in an agricultural environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{lithium lens}} in the {{antiproton}} source target vault {{is protected by}} an interlock system, which is located in relay racks R 5 and R 6 near {{the southwest corner of}} the Target Hall (building APO). The interlock system consists of crates of commercial signal conditioner and alarm modules built by Acromag, Inc and interlock Master Modules built by Fermilab: Twenty analog signals from the lens/transformer, power supply, and cooling water system are buffered with signal conditioners (amplifiers), which are located in creates R 5 C and R 5 E. The signals and conditioner assignments are listed in Table 1. Interconnection details are shown in Figure 1. Thermocouple signals come into the conditioners directly from the vault or water system via 12 -pair multiconductor thermocouple extension cables. All other signals pass through a master connection panel on the east end of rack R 6. Water flow signals are AC voltages which must be converted by electronics in crate D 2 B to DC voltages before entering their signal conditioners. Each conditioner drives two parallel outputs. One output goes to a Multiplexed Analog to Digital Converter (MADC 25), which is located in R 5 D. This voltage output is read by the accelerator control network (ACNET) and can be displayed at any control console on parameter page P 46. The other voltage output is connected to an alarm module. Thirteen analog signals are processed by alarm modules, which are located in crates R 6 B and R 6 C. Alarm connection details are shown in Figure 2. Each alarm module contains two DPDT relays, one for an upper limit and one for a lower limit. The relays are latching, so that once an input has passed outside a limit, that limit relay remains in the tripped condition until an operator issues a reset pulse. The reset may be generated locally with a pushbutton on the appropriate interlock master module or remotely from controls parameter page P 46 via ACNET. <b>Alarm</b> <b>settings</b> are summarized in engineering units in Table 1, and actual comparitor voltage settings are listed in Figure 2. Each alarm crate contains 10 module slots and is wired as shown in Figure 3, except for the water conductivity slot, which is wired to a separate interlock chain output. Normally open contacts are used for interlock chains, while normally closed contacts provide status bits. The interlock chain outputs are connected to Interlock Master Modules located in D 5 C. Status bits are read into ACNET through a multiplexer in R 4 A, and can be displayed on parameter page S 40. Any alarm slot may be bypassed by inserting a 'dummy' printed circuit card in place of a module. Each interlock master module sums 5 inputs and provides 3 reed relay contact closure outputs. A circuit schematic is shown in Figure 4. Input 1 requires + 5 volts, and directly energizes an interlock chain relay. Input 2 and 3 require TTL logic levels, and inputs 4 and 5 require and external contact closure. Internal switches select which inputs are active Interlock master interconnections are shown in Figure 5. The lens uses two masters, one for water conductivity and the other for all interlocked conditions. The Conductivity Master controls the lens water purging system and also energizes one input of the General Master. The General Master provides the external interlock for the pulsed power supply. If lithium comes into contact with the cooling water, the conductivity master will trip. Output 2 of the Master shuts off the water circulating pump and initiates purging hardware, which isolates the lens from the water supply and allows inert gas to force remaining water from the lens into a reservoir located in the vault. Output 1 of the Master, which is connected to input 4 of the lens General Master, causes the General Master to trip and disable the pulsed power supply. All other lens alarm conditions (except conductivity) enter input 1 and 2 of the Lens General Master. An alarm condition from these inputs will disable the pulsed power supply, but the water system will remain on. Each interlock master has a manual Emergency Stop pushbutton (red) on its front panel. The pushbutton has alternating action, one push enabling the interlock master, the next push opening the interlock chain. all interlock masters are connected to an audible trip alarm module located in R 5 E- 6...|$|E
