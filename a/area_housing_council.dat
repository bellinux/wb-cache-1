500|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, the land {{directly}} above this central area was being developed. To house the growing population, rows of terrace houses were built, which slowly encompassed the area north up to Marble Hall Road, and east to Pill, examples including Shakespeare Avenue and Starbuck Road. [...] The Great North Road took a northerly route which sliced this new district in two. Suburban owner-occupied detached and semi-detached properties {{grew up on}} land overlooking the waterway and along the course of Steynton Road. [...] Around {{the start of the}} 20th century, there was a recognized need to provide accommodation to poorer families. As a result, much former agricultural land was bought, and new <b>Council</b> <b>Housing</b> was built. These were frequently in large estates of houses, such as Howarth Close, Haven Drive and The Glebelands Estate. They transformed previously rural areas into an urban landscape, and considerably increased Milford's <b>area</b> of <b>housing.</b> <b>Council</b> estates were built throughout the 20th century, one of the most recent and largest examples being The Mount Estate, which has been the scene of a number of anti-social incidents.|$|R

50|$|In 1981, the Council under Angelo Siracusa {{reported}} {{that there was a}} 300,000 unit regional housing shortage, with housing starts falling behind need by over 5,000 units per year. Siracusa was an early opponent of the Bay Area-invented syndrome known as “Not In My Back Yard.” He criticized “NIMBY” opposition to dense, infill housing as “blind and selfish,” and attempted to counter it by forming the Bay <b>Area</b> <b>Council’s</b> <b>Housing</b> Action Task Force (HATF). The HATF focused on what became a decade-long effort to increase the density of housing construction, bring more land into residential development, stimulate the creation of rental units, and streamline the torturous process of local land use decision-making. Around this time, the Council also helped create Bridge Housing Corporation. Under its founder, Don Turner, and with the zealous encouragement of Council Chairman, Chevron CEO, George Keller, Bridge Housing became among the nation’s largest and most successful affordable housing-related non-profits.|$|R
