The purpose of this action is to reduce unobserved crab injury and mortality in the Central Gulf of Alaska from potential adverse effects of nonpelagic trawl gear for flatfish fishing. This action also modified existing regulations to increase the maximum length permissible for door and new bridles between the trawl sweeps from 180 feet to 185 feet in the Bering Sea.

5000|$|Production and {{processing}} of nori is an advanced form of agriculture. The biology of Pyropia, although complicated, is well understood, and this knowledge {{is used to}} control the production process. Farming {{takes place in the}} sea where the Pyropia plants grow <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>nets</b> suspended at the sea surface and where the farmers operate from boats. The plants grow rapidly, requiring about 45 days from [...] "seeding" [...] until the first harvest. Multiple harvests can be taken from a single seeding, typically at about ten-day intervals. Harvesting is accomplished using mechanical harvesters of a variety of configurations. Processing of raw product is mostly accomplished by highly automated machines that accurately duplicate traditional manual processing steps, but with much improved efficiency and consistency. The final product is a paper-thin, black, dried sheet of approximately 18 × 20 cm and 3 g in weight.|$|R

5000|$|The ground-line hitch {{is a type}} of knot used <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> a rope <b>to</b> an object. Worked-up {{and dressed}} properly, it is more secure than the simpler clove hitch and has less {{tendency}} to jam, but does not respond well to swinging. It can also be used as a simple binding knot and is classed among several knots known as the miller's knot. [...] The Ground-line hitch is also the start of a three-lead four-bight Turk's head.The knot is named for its use <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> a <b>net</b> <b>to</b> the groundline, a weighted or lead cored rope {{on the bottom of the}} net (especially a gillnet).|$|R

Between the frame and the envelope and linking the two was a small hemp net. The net was attached by wooden toggles to a canvas band sewn directly onto the envelope, and the frame was <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the <b>net</b> by further toggles. This permitted the easy removal of the frame from the envelope. The frame itself could also be dismantled for ease of transport.|$|R

However, during fishing {{operations}} the vessel is not <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the <b>nets.</b> The {{size of the}} vessels varies from open boats to large specialised drifters operating on the high seas. The wheelhouse is usually located aft, and the front deck is used for handling gear. Normally the nets are set at the stern by steaming ahead. Hauling is done over the side at the forepart of the deck, usually using hydraulic driven net haulers. Wet fish is packed in containers chilled with ice. Larger vessels might freeze the catch.|$|R
40|$|In most {{patients}} with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), citrullinated autoantigens are targeted by autoantibodies (ACPA). However, the process leading to protein citrullination by peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) {{in the joint}} remains unclear. In this thesis, I tested the hypothesis that generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETosis), can contribute to release of enzymatically active PADs and citrullinated autoantigens in inflamed joints. I have shown that in vitro induced NETosis leads to release of citrullinated proteins and enzymatically active PADs both <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>NETs</b> and free in the supernatant. In the SF from RA patients DNA levels correlated with neutrophil concentrations, and DNA levels and PAD activity {{were found to be}} increased compared with OA patients. Finally, I demonstrated the antigenicity of in vitro generated NETs and identified citrullinated histone H 3 as a NET-component recognised by ACPA and RA sera. Based on the findings in this thesis release of active PADs into SF by neutrophil cell death is a plausible explanation for the generation of citrullinated extracellular autoantigens. In ACPA positive RA patients the continuous production of these autoantigens combined with pre-existing ACPA may result in the formation of immune complexes and perpetuation of the inflammatory response. ...|$|R

The captain (piloto) of the ship observes the water, fish movements under the boat and estimates how deep the net should go then asks the crew to get ready. During the preparation of releasing the net, the central lights are turned off until those on the bow and stern will remain turned on in order to ensure the fish stays under the boat but move toward the bow and stern. Away from the center where one of the crew will measure the rope using fathoms dipa and will release the net based on the measurement in a very slow process.

5000|$|In both sports, {{the goal}} {{structure}} {{consists of a}} crossbar suspended 10 ft {{off the ground and}} goal posts (colloquially known as [...] "uprights") placed 18 ft apart and extending at least 35 ft above the crossbar. In lower levels of play the goal posts may be placed further apart and/or not extend as far above the crossbar; for example, in high school football the posts are 23 ft apart. NFL and CFL rules mandate that a ribbon be <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the top of each goal post. Goals are centered on the field, but on different lines: in American football, they lie on the [...] "end line" [...] (far end of the end zone) and in Canadian, on the [...] "goal line" [...] (beginning of the end zone). A retractable net may be placed behind the goal, well beyond the field of play, to prevent the ball from entering spectator areas. Similarly, in arena football, the field goal is similar to that in American and Canadian football. A field goal in arena football scores three points, unless it is drop kicked, in which case it scores four points. The goal structure in arena football is much smaller than the outdoor game; it consists of a crossbar 15 ft above the playing surface and 9.5 ft wide; this size is also used for most other indoor leagues as well. Uniquely in arena football, the goal posts are <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>nets</b> {{on either side of the}} crossbar which are taut to allow the ball to rebound back onto the field of play. The nets are 30 ft wide and 37 ft high. These nets do not represent a scoring area, but keep the ball in play and prevent it from entering the crowd.|$|R
50|$|Contemporary {{cast nets}} have a radius which ranges from 4 to 12 feet (1.2 to 3.6 metres). Only strong people can lift the larger nets {{once they are}} filled with fish. Standard nets for {{recreational}} fishing have a four-foot hoop. Weights are usually distributed around the edge at about one pound per foot (1.5 kilograms per metre). <b>Attached</b> <b>to</b> the <b>net</b> is a handline, one end of which is held in the hand as the net is thrown. When the net is full, a retrieval clamp, which works like a wringer on a mop, closes the net around the fish. The net is then retrieved by pulling on this handline. The net is lifted into a bucket and the clamp is released, dumping the caught fish into the bucket.|$|R

40|$|A model, {{composed}} of coupled particle tracking and benthic response modules, for predicting waste solids flux and benthic impacts of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L.) and sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) aquaculture, was tested at six sites with different hydrodynamics, bathymetries and biomasses in the Aegean and Ionian Seas, Eastern Mediterranean with observations of sediment trap flux and benthic impact indicators. Seven sediment trap validation studies were conducted that varied in design with traps deployed {{either on the}} sea bed, <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>nets</b> or in the water column. Model predictions of flux to traps spaced 5 m apart up to 50 m from the cages over a 13 d period were statistically significant (r 2 = 0. 61, n = 57, p ≤ 0. 05). However, the model could not predict adequately the flux to traps spaced 2 m apart in the high-flux zone underneath cages where variability between trap observations was high. In this high-flux zone underneath cages, the averaged model flux predictions resulted in a performance of ± 49 %. Statistically significant relationships were established at four sites; between modelled flux and either benthic fauna impact indicator species (S), abundance (A), A/S ratio, Shannon Wiener Index or Biomass Fractionation Index (BFI), (r 2 = 0. 82, 0. 60, 0. 57, 0. 67 and 0. 48, respectively; n = 24, p ≤ 0. 05). Two other sites, which did not exhibit an abundance peak in enriched zones, did not fit these relationships.

In the experiments, the display of a non-intrusive stereo imaging measurement of the three-dimensional net geometry was established by tracing the positions of the LED markers on the cage net. A 1 / 30 -scale model of a net cage was used composing of top and bottom hoops (or rings), nets, four buoys and four anchor blocks moored to the tank bottom. Trinocular stereo imaging, which used three synchronized video cameras to follow the three-dimensional displacements of 37 Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the <b>net,</b> was em-ployed <b>to</b> monitor the deformation and motion of the fish net.

50|$|DFT {{techniques}} {{have been used}} {{at least since the}} early days of electric/electronic data processing equipment. Early examples from the 1940s/50s are the switches and instruments that allowed an engineer to “scan” (i.e., selectively probe) the voltage/current at some internal nodes in an analog computer scan. DFT often is associated with design modifications that provide improved access to internal circuit elements such that the local internal state can be controlled (controllability) and/or observed (observability) more easily. The design modifications can be strictly physical in nature (e.g., adding a physical probe point <b>to</b> a <b>net)</b> and/or add active circuit elements to facilitate controllability/observability (e.g., inserting a multiplexer into a net). While controllability and observability improvements for internal circuit elements definitely are important for test, they are not the only type of DFT. Other guidelines, for example, deal with the electromechanical characteristics of the interface between the product under test and the test equipment. Examples are guidelines for the size, shape, and spacing of probe points, or the suggestion to add a high-impedance state <b>to</b> drivers <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> probed <b>nets</b> such that the risk of damage from back-driving is mitigated.|$|R
