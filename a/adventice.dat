40|$|This Catalogue {{includes}} the taxonomic {{units of the}} native and exotic taxa, both <b>adventice</b> and cultivated of the vascular flora of Sicily. Species and subspecies, as well as varieties and forms are taken into consideration, contrary to the actual tendency to include only the former. The main aim of the Catalogue is therefore to analyze the flora {{of the largest and}} significant island of the Mediterranean, and to give a tool for specialists of the field and an informative basis of the regional biodiversity in favour of preserving and promoting actions. Together with synonymic information on each single taxon, the Catalogue includes ecological and distributive references of the region. Nomemclatural novelties and the descriptions of new taxa are also included. Taxa referring to naturalized or cultivated native and exotic plants, which are widely sponta- neous, are numbered. Non numbered problematic taxa are also reported. Bibliography is given for each taxonomic unit. The Catalogue includes in total 176 families, 878 genera, and 3201 specific and infra-specific taxa (subspecies, varieties and forms) excluding doubtful and extinct ones as well as exotic cul- tivated...|$|E

30|$|ICMA are {{relatively}} rare, accounting {{for less than}} 10 % of neurologic complications of IE. They usually result from septic embolization to the vasa vasorum or to the intraluminal space of the vessel itself. Septic emboli are responsible for an inflammatory lesion starting on the <b>adventice</b> surface and ultimately destroying the intima. ICMA are multiple in 25 % of the cases and are mostly located in the distal branches of the middle artery. Streptococci {{and to a lesser}} extent S. aureus are responsible for most ICMA. Nonruptured ICMA are responsible for fever, headache, seizures, and focal deficit. Patients with ruptured ICMA have sudden arachnoid or intracerebral bleeding, associating decreased level of consciousness, intracranial hypertension, and focal deficit. Rupture generally occurs at the early phase of IE, but in some patients, especially those with streptococcal IE, rupture may observed during antibiotic course of even after the end of therapy. CT-scan angiography and MR angiography are of equal value to detect ICMA > 5 mm. Although conventional angiography may still be useful for the detection of very small ICMA, two-dimensional and three-dimensional helical CT also have high sensitivity [21].|$|E

In contradistinction to Thellung who {{distinguished}} in his “Flore <b>adventice</b> de Montpellier” 4 subspecies, the present authors subdivide the species into 2 subspecies, each with some varieties. They can be identified with the aid of the following key. In using this key, one must be {{aware of the fact that}} several transitions between the subspecies and the varieties exist. 1.
