5|$|Maryse began a {{rivalry with}} Michelle McCool in September 2008, {{challenging}} {{her for the}} WWE Divas Championship at Unforgiven, and in a rematch the following week on SmackDown, but failed to win on both occasions. On the September 23 episode of ECW, Maryse defeated McCool in a non-title match. After a month-long absence, Maryse returned at Survivor Series pay-per-view event in November, participating in a five-on-five Divas elimination tag team match, eliminating Kelly Kelly, Mickie James and Candice Michelle; Maryse was the sole survivor of her team, but was ultimately eliminated by Beth Phoenix. At the Armageddon pay-per-view on December 14, Maryse teamed up with Jillian Hall, Victoria and Natalya in a losing effort to McCool, Maria, Kelly Kelly and Mickie James in an Eight-Diva Santa's Little Helper tag team match. On December 19, Maryse pinned Maria to become the number one contender for Michelle McCool's Divas Championship. The following week on SmackDown, Maryse defeated McCool, with Maria as the special guest referee, to win her first Divas Championship. On December 28, at a house show in Raleigh, North Carolina, Maryse dislocated her knee in a tag team match against The Bella Twins (Nikki and Brie). It was later announced that the injury was not major, and therefore only missed a few weeks action. On the January 23, 2009 episode of SmackDown, Maryse returned <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> ringside commentating during a Divas' tag team match. She returned to in-ring action on February 20, teaming with Michelle McCool in a win against Maria and Eve Torres, where she pinned Torres.|$|E

He called for anyone who could hear him to get an ambulance. Rosencrantz, who had collapsed while chasing Workman, {{rose to his feet}} and demanded the barman (who had hidden during the shootout) give him five nickels in exchange for his quarter.

25|$|President Lincoln visited Richmond {{escorted by}} Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter, 3 {{officers}} and 10 sailors. Jubilant African-Americans surrounded {{him on his}} walk.

On 14 July 1952 the first of the B class diesel electric locomotives, which were to revolutionise train operations in Victoria, was delivered to the VR and travelled from NSW to Melbourne's Spencer Street Station under its own power. The elderly Harold Clapp climbed into the cab of locomotive B 60 <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> the controls, and was honoured by having the new locomotive named after him.|$|E
25|$|To date Carlisle United {{have played}} 82 {{seasons in the}} Football League, their relegation in 2004 and {{reinstatement}} the following year remains the only departure from the Football League since the club was first admitted in 1928 (excluding wartime). United are currently the only club to have reached {{the final of the}} Football League Trophy on six occasions. This, this alongside their two wins, makes them the most successful club in the competition's history. The club's highest achievement outside of cup competitions came in 1974 when the club was promoted to the first tier of English football <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> the top of the league there for short time. Carlisle still remains the smallest location in England, by local population, to have had a resident top-flight football team since 1906.|$|E

500|$|John Hay {{was sworn}} in as Secretary of State on September 30, 1898. He needed little {{introduction}} to Cabinet meetings, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> the President's right hand. [...] Meetings were held in the Cabinet Room of the White House, where he found his old office and bedroom each occupied by several clerks. Now responsible for 1,300 federal employees, he leaned heavily for administrative help on his old friend Alvey Adee, the second assistant.|$|E
500|$|The {{search for}} a new guitarist and drummer began with {{advertisements}} placed in copies of Melody Maker. The invitation was spotted by drummer Phil Collins, formerly of Flaming Youth who already knew Stratton-Smith. He recalled, [...] "My only knowledge of Genesis was through seeing the ads for their gigs. It seemed like they were constantly working. ... I thought 'At least I'm going to be working if I get the gig'." [...] Roger Taylor, subsequently of Queen, turned down an invitation to audition. Collins went to the audition at Gabriel's parents' house in Chobham, Surrey with his Flaming Youth band mate, guitarist Ronnie Caryl. As they arrived early, Collins took a swim in the pool and heard what the other drummers were playing. [...] "They put on 'Trespass', and my initial impression of a very soft and round music, not edgy, with vocal harmonies and I came away thinking Crosby, Stills and Nash". Gabriel and Rutherford noticed the confident way Collins approached <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> his drum kit and knew he would be the right replacement. Banks said, [...] "It was a combination of things. He could make it swing a little bit ... he could also tell good jokes and make us laugh ... And he could sing, which was an advantage because Mike and I were not very good at back-up vocals". In August 1970, Collins became the new drummer for Genesis. Caryl's audition was unsuccessful; Rutherford thought he was not the player the group were looking for.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Hurricane Katrina {{broke the}} ex-USNS Upshur free of her {{moorings}} and settled her 500 feet across the Mobile River {{on the bank}} of a coal terminal.

[...] The talks were successful, culminating in the Belfast Agreement of 10 April 1998, which resulted in power-sharing with Nationalists.

At the age of 19, he left the seminary due to sheer frustration because he was appalled that the rectors ate better food <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> higher tables than the seminarians. He later confessed that, [...] "I was disillusioned, because {{there was a lot of}} difference between precept and practice where the Church was concerned." [...] He began work at the age of 19, organising exploited workers in the road transport industry and in the hotels and restaurants in Mangalore.|$|E
2500|$|A popular anecdote {{was when}} the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, met President Vladimir Putin, Putin brought Konni to their meetings. On 21 January 2007, the two leaders met at Bocharov Ruchei, the President's summer {{residence}} in Sochi, and {{at the beginning of}} their meeting Konni wandered into the room, leading Putin to ask Merkel, who reportedly has a [...] "deep-seated fear of dogs", [...] "The dog does not bother you, does she? She's a friendly dog and I'm sure she will behave herself." [...] Merkel responded in Russian, a language in which she is fluent, [...] "She doesn't eat journalists, after all." [...] Konni then proceeded to sniff the German Chancellor, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> her feet. Merkel was reported to have shown [...] "apparent discomfort". Putin later said that, after learning of Merkel's fear of dogs, he apologized to her.|$|E

2500|$|The {{commission}} {{began its}} work on 1 October. Amongst the first tasks was a hearing from two {{representatives of the}} miners who asked for a two-week postponement, which was rejected by Farlam. He also took a personal tour of {{the site of the}} protests. On the first day, he toured the site of the shootings hearing from the forensic expert who had examined the site <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> the koppie (hill) where the miners hid from police. On the second day, he went to see the miners' dormitories—including where families can stay and an informal settlement. Al Jazeera's Tania Page said that the site had been cleaned since the incident and that the commission's challenge would be [...] "to see the truth and find an objective balance when all the parties involved have had time to cover their tracks." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clifford's Inn {{was ruled}} by its Council, which {{was led by}} a Principal. As well as the Principal, the Council {{consisted}} of twelve barristers, all elected by the Inn members and who enjoyed certain rights; they could hold chambers whenever they wanted <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> a separate upper table to dine. The Principal was elected by the entire Inn's membership and was tasked with overseeing its day-to-day running and supervision of the Inn's servants; his privileges included {{the right to choose}} from any one of 18 sets of chambers and a generous allowance for beer. Principals were originally elected for life, but subsequent to a council order dated 15 June 1668 they were subject to re-election every three years. However, between 1668 and the last election in 1890, only 21 men served as Principal of Clifford's Inn, since [...] "once elected, always elected" [...] unless infirm became customary practice.|$|E
2500|$|Reading {{the report}} of Tamar in [...] "She sat in the gate of Enaim," [...] Rabbi Alexander taught that Tamar went <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> the {{entrance}} of the place of Abraham, the place to which all eyes ( [...] , einaim) look. Alternatively, Rav Hanin said in the name of Rav that there is a place called Enaim, and it is the same place mentioned in [...] when it speaks of [...] "Tappuah and Enam." [...] Alternatively, Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani taught that the place is called Enaim because Tamar gave eyes ( [...] , einaim) to her words; that is, Tamar gave convincing replies to Judah's questions. When Judah solicited her, he asked her if she was a Gentile, and she replied that she was a convert. When Judah asked her if she was a married woman, she replied that she was unmarried. When Judah asked her if perhaps her father had accepted marriage proposals on her behalf betrothals (making her forbidden to Judah), she replied that she was an orphan. When Judah asked her if perhaps she was ritually unclean (because she was a menstruant, or niddah, and thus forbidden to Judah), she replied that she was clean..|$|E
