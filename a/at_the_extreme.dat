40|$|Objective The {{progressive}} rise {{in demand}} on NHS emergency care resources is partly attributable {{to increases in}} attendances of children and older people. A quality gap exists in the care provision for {{the old and the}} young. The Five Year Forward View suggested new models of care but that the "answer is not one-size-fits-all". This article discusses the urgent need for person-centred outcome measures to bridge the gap that exists between demand and provision. Design This review is based on evidence gathered from literature searching across several platforms using a variety of search terms to account for the obvious heterogeneity, drawing on key 'think-tank' evidence. Settings Qualitative and quantitative studies examining approaches to caring for individuals <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> of age. Participants Individuals <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> of age (infants and older people). Main Outcome Measures Understanding similarities and disparities in the care of individuals <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> of age in an emergency and non-emergency context. Results There exists several similarities and disparities in the care of individuals <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> of age. <b>The</b> increasing burden of health disease on the economy must acknowledge the challenges that exist in managing patients in emergency settings <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> of age and build systems to acknowledge the traits these individuals exhibit. Conclusion Commissioners of services must optimise the models of care delivery by appreciating the similarities and differences between care requirements in these two large groups seeking emergency care.

30|$|Together, {{the results}} from the {{accuracy}} analysis are consistent with the psychometric fitting results. In both the blur and the noise conditions, we see {{a significant difference between the}} two age groups only at intermediate levels of blur (or noise) and not <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> (i.e. <b>the</b> lowest and highest levels of blur or noise). This pattern of results is consistent with a lateral (horizontal) shift of a sigmoid function, which produces larger differences in the y-values (percentage correct) at intermediate x-values (e.g. intermediate levels of blur) and a smaller difference <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>extremes.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> of {{interactions}} are galactic mergers. In {{this case the}} relative momentum of the two galaxies is insufficient to allow the galaxies to pass through each other. Instead, they gradually merge to form a single, larger galaxy. Mergers can result in significant changes to morphology, {{as compared to the}} original galaxies. If one of the merging galaxies is much more massive than the other merging galaxy then the result is known as cannibalism. The more massive larger galaxy will remain relatively undisturbed by the merger, while the smaller galaxy is torn apart. The Milky Way galaxy is currently in the process of cannibalizing the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy and the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} year, the {{garrison}} would be plagued by mosquitoes and the heat and humidity common to the Washington area during the summer. Though Fort Greble was built on a hill, the area immediately surrounding the fort consisted of swampy bottomland drained by the Anacostia and Potomac rivers, {{a breeding ground for}} malaria. Communication with the outside world was provided by the military road that served the Eastern Branch line of forts, and supply wagons would usually arrive on a weekly schedule. Trips to Washington or Uniontown from the fort were uncommon, and by virtue of its location <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> end of the Eastern Branch defenses, Fort Greble was isolated even from its neighboring forts.|$|E
5|$|It {{is usually}} a {{permanent}} resident throughout its range, although birds <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> north of its range may migrate short distances, and others across their range may undergo local movements in unfavourable conditions. In South America, its range stretches to central Chile and Argentina. It also is found as a vagrant on the islands of the Caribbean. It prefers open land interspersed with areas of woods or brush. It {{is also found in}} moist lowland forests, shrublands and grasslands, wetlands and swamps, pastures, and heavily degraded former forests. Preferring lowlands, it is rarely seen in mountainous areas. It is usually seen soaring or perched on fence posts or dead trees.|$|E

These {{structures}} are all old athletic venues which have been replaced with new structures elsewhere on campus. The eastern part of campus is also the home of the Energy and Environmental Research Center complex which includes the National Center for Hydrogen Technology. The Grand Forks Human Nutrition Research Center, which is operated by the United States Department of Agriculture, is also in this part of campus. A five-story parking garage sits at the corner of University Avenue and Columbia Road. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> eastern portion of campus sits University Park which is operated by the Grand Forks Park District.|$|E

(This can be obtained by setting F=0 in their respective PPF equations and summing them up). Here the slope of the joint PPF is -1/2.|$|E

40|$|Infants and {{the elderly}} share a high {{vulnerability}} to infections and therefore have specific immunization requirements.

Several mechanisms to explain the decreased B-cell responses <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> of age apply to both infants {{and the elderly}}. These include intrinsic B-cell limitations as well as numerous microenvironmental factors in lymphoid organs and the bone marrow.

5|$|A {{long and}} winding route {{had to be}} taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> ends of the decks, and so was the {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps no coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E
5|$|As {{fighting}} raged in the Wheatfield and Devil's Den, Col. Strong Vincent of V Corps had {{a precarious}} hold on Little Round Top, an important hill <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> {{left of the}} Union line. His brigade of four relatively small regiments was able to resist repeated assaults by Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law's brigade of Hood's division. Meade's chief engineer, Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, had realized {{the importance of this}} position, and dispatched Vincent's brigade, an artillery battery, and the 140th New York to occupy Little Round Top mere minutes before Hood's troops arrived. The defense of Little Round Top with a bayonet charge by the 20th Maine, ordered by Col. Joshua L. Chamberlain but possibly led by Lt. Holman S. Melcher, {{was one of the most}} fabled episodes in the Civil War and propelled Col. Chamberlain into prominence after the war.|$|E
5|$|Devil's Den {{was located}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> {{left of the}} III Corps line, manned by the large brigade (six regiments and two {{companies}} of sharpshooters, 2,200 men in all) of Brigadier General J. H. Hobart Ward, in Maj. Gen. David B. Birney's division. It was {{the southern end of}} Houck's Ridge, a modest elevation on the northwest side of Plum Run Valley, made distinctive by piles of huge boulders. These boulders were not the direct avenue of approach used by the Confederates. The 3rd Arkansas and the 1st Texas drove through Rose Woods and hit Ward's line head-on. His troops had lacked the time or inclination to erect breastworks, and for over an hour both sides participated in a standup fight of unusual ferocity. In the first 30 minutes, the 20th Indiana lost more than half of its men. Its colonel, John Wheeler, was killed and its lieutenant colonel wounded. The 86th New York also lost its commander. The commander of the 3rd Arkansas fell wounded, one of 182 casualties in his regiment.|$|E
