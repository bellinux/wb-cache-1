She co-starred in The Manchurian Candidate (2004), The Departed (2006), The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (2008), <b>and</b> <b>Nothing</b> <b>But</b> the Truth (2008).

5|$|During 19 April, {{the fourth}} day, the 1st Belorussian Front {{broke through the}} final line of the Seelow Heights; <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> broken German {{formations}} lay between them and Berlin. The 1st Ukrainian Front, having captured Forst the day before, was fanning out into open country. One powerful thrust by Gordov's 3rd Guards Army and Rybalko's 3rd and Lelyushenko's 4th Guards Tank Armies were heading north-east towards Berlin while other armies headed west towards {{a section of the}} United States Army's front line south-west of Berlin on the Elbe. With these advances, the Soviet forces drove a wedge between the German Army Group Vistula in the north and Army Group Centre in the south. By the end of the day, the German eastern front line north of Frankfurt around Seelow and to the south around Forst had ceased to exist. These breakthroughs allowed the two Soviet Fronts to envelop the German 9th Army in a large pocket west of Frankfurt. Attempts by the 9th Army to break out to the west resulted in the Battle of Halbe. The cost to the Soviet forces had been very high, with over 2,807 tanks lost between 1 and 19 April, including at least 727 at the Seelow Heights.|$|E

25|$|With {{his novels}} {{providing}} scant income, Thompson turned to {{other forms of}} writing to pay the bills. Beginning in 1959, and continuing through the mid-1960s, Thompson also began writing television programs, including episodes of the action/adventure shows Mackenzie's Raiders (1959), Cain's Hundred (1961) and Convoy (1965). TV work seemingly dried up for Thompson after this point, so he turned to writing tie-in novels based on produced TV shows and screenplays: this work paid a flat fee, and could be completed quickly. Thompson's tie-ins include an original novel based on the TV series Ironside (1967), as well as screenplay novelizations of the films The Undefeated (1969) <b>and</b> <b>Nothing</b> <b>But</b> a Man (1970).|$|E

500|$|The {{work was}} written {{sometime}} in the early 13th century, and is explicitly dedicated to Frederick II. The scholar James Wood Brown argues that the book was likely written and then presented to soon-to-be Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in AD 1209 {{on the occasion of}} his wedding to Constance of Aragon. Brown also adds, [...] "No date suits this publication so well as 1209, <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> the urgent desire of Court and people that the marriage should prove fruitful can explain, one might add excuse, some passages of almost fescennine license which it contains." [...] The philosophy and religion scholar Irven Resnick argues that the work was given to Frederick so that [...] "the emperor [...] to distinguish, from outward appearances, trustworthy and wise counselors from their opposite numbers." ...|$|E

500|$|In the 4th century, Roman domes proliferated due {{to changes}} in the way domes were constructed, {{including}} advances in centering techniques and the use of brick ribbing. The so-called [...] "Temple of Minerva Medica", for example, used brick ribs along with step-rings and lightweight pumice aggregate concrete to form a decagonal dome. The material of choice in construction gradually transitioned during the 4th and 5th centuries from stone or concrete to lighter brick in thin shells. The use of ribs stiffened the structure, allowing domes to be thinner with less massive supporting walls. Windows were often used in these walls and replaced the oculus as a source of light, although buttressing was sometimes necessary to compensate for large openings. The Mausoleum of Santa Costanza has windows beneath the dome <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> paired columns beneath that, using a surrounding barrel vault to buttress the structure.|$|E
500|$|Paramount, whose {{contract}} guaranteed another film by Hitchcock, did {{not want}} Hitchcock to make Psycho. Paramount was expecting No Bail for the Judge starring Audrey Hepburn, who became pregnant and had to bow out, leading Hitchcock to scrap the production. Their official stance was that the book was [...] "too repulsive" [...] and [...] "impossible for films", <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> another of his star-studded mystery thrillers would suffice. They did not like [...] "anything about it at all" [...] and denied him his usual budget. In response Hitchcock financed the film's creation through his own Shamley Productions, shooting at Universal Studios under the Revue television unit. The original Bates Motel and Bates house set buildings, which were constructed on the same stage as Lon Chaney Sr.'s The Phantom of the Opera, are still standing at Universal Studios in Universal City near Hollywood and are a regular attraction on the studio's tour. As a further result of cost cutting, Hitchcock chose to film Psycho {{in black and white}}, keeping the budget under $1,000,000. Other reasons for shooting in black and white were his desire to prevent the shower scene from being too gory and his admiration for Les Diaboliquess use of black and white.|$|E
500|$|Canning, held at Newgate, was {{reported}} to be in the presence of Methodists, an unfortunate accusation for her side. [...] On the same day this report appeared, handbills were circulated asserting that the Rector of St Mary Magdalen had visited her and was satisfied that she was still a member of the Church of England. Among her visitors was Mr Justice Ledinard, who had helped deliver Virtue Hall to Gascoyne. [...] Ledinard asked Canning to confess but was told by Canning that [...] "I have said the whole truth in court, <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> the truth; and I don't choose to answer any questions, unless it be in court again." [...] Despite calls for clemency, she was taken to the convict ship Tryal for her voyage to British America. [...] Several threats made by the ship's crew, however, meant she eventually sailed on board the Myrtilla in August 1754. [...] Canning arrived in Wethersfield, Connecticut, and by arrangement with her supporters went to live with the Methodist Reverend Elisha Williams. [...] She was not employed as a servant, but was taken in as a member of Williams' family. [...] Williams died in 1755, and Canning married John Treat (a distant relation of the former governor Robert Treat) on 24November 1756, had a son (Joseph Canning Treat) in June 1758, and a daughter (Elizabeth) in November 1761. [...] She had two more sons (John and Salmon), but died suddenly in June 1773.|$|E

In regard to style, the Victorians' aim, achieved through far-reaching metaphrase (literality) or pseudo-metaphrase, was to constantly remind readers that they were reading a foreign classic. An exception was the outstanding translation in this period, Edward FitzGerald's Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (1859), which achieved its Oriental flavor largely by using Persian names and discreet Biblical echoes and actually drew little of its material from the Persian original.|$|E
