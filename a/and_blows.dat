They asked Hergé to replace this page with a less violent scene, which they believed would be more suitable for children. Hergé agreed, as he regretted the scenes of big-game hunting in the work soon after producing it. The altered page involved the rhinoceros running away unharmed after accidentally knocking down and triggering Tintin's gun.|$|E
5|$|A {{white dwarf}} star in a close binary system can {{accumulate}} material from its companion until it ignites <b>and</b> <b>blows</b> off in a thermonuclear explosion, known as a nova. These stars generally brighten by 7 to 16 magnitudes. Nova Circini 1926, also known as X Circini, was observed at magnitude 6.5 on 3 September 1926, before fading and fluctuating between magnitudes 11.7 and 12.5, during 1928, and magnitude 13, in 1929. Nova Circini 1995 (BY Circini) reached an maximum apparent magnitude of 7.2 in January 1995. BW Circini is a low mass X-ray binary system, comprising a black hole of around 8 solar masses and a yellow G0III-G5III subgiant star. X-ray outbursts were recorded in 1987 and 1997, and possibly 1971–72.|$|E
5|$|In November 1955, a {{grand jury}} {{declined}} to indict Bryant and Milam for kidnapping, despite their own admissions of having taken Till. Mose Wright and {{a young man named}} Willie Reed, who testified to seeing Milam enter the shed from which screams <b>and</b> <b>blows</b> were heard, both testified in front of the grand jury. After the trial, T.R.M.Howard paid the costs of relocating to Chicago for Wright, Reed, and another black witness who testified against Milam and Bryant, {{in order to protect the}} three witnesses from reprisals for having testified. Reed, who later changed his name to Willie Louis to avoid being found, continued to live in the Chicago area until his death on July 18, 2013. He avoided publicity and even kept his history secret from his wife until she was told by a relative. Reed began to speak publicly about the case in the PBS documentary The Murder of Emmett Till aired in 2003.|$|E

50|$|A Blowing snow {{advisory}} {{was issued}} by the National Weather Service of the United States when wind driven snow reduces surface visibility and possibly hampers traveling. Blowing snow may be falling snow, or snow that has already accumulated but is picked up <b>and</b> <b>blown</b> by strong winds. This advisory was discontinued beginning with the 2008-09 winter storm season, replaced by the Winter Weather Advisory for Snow <b>and</b> <b>Blowing</b> Snow.

5|$|Suffering {{withdrawal}} syndrome from {{the lack of}} cable, Peter straps a television-sized cardboard cutout to himself, making it appear as though his whole world is actually a television programme. When Meg can no longer deal with the public scorn, she reveals that her father is really responsible for Quahog's loss of television, causing the town to turn against him. In an attempt to save Peter from further scorn and verbal attacks, Lois gives a heartfelt speech to the community about how television has kept them all from enjoying one another. Inspired by the speech, Peter drags the family to one outdoor activity after another, which quickly exhausts them. Once the family can no longer keep up with him, Peter decides to go off with William Shatner, who has appeared on the Griffin family doorstep after experiencing a flat tire, to a nearby festival. Meanwhile, Stewie's weather machine creates a huge rainstorm. The storm's lightning strike destroys Stewie's weather machine <b>and</b> <b>blows</b> Stewie off the roof and on the ground.

5|$|Wilson had a combative {{streak and}} {{sometimes}} initiated fights with opposing players and fans. On June 22, 1928, a near-riot {{broke out in}} the ninth inning at Wrigley Field against the St. Louis Cardinals when Wilson jumped into the box seats to attack a heckling fan. An estimated 5,000 spectators swarmed the field before police could separate the combatants and restore order. The fan sued Wilson for $20,000, but a jury ruled in his favor. The following year he took offense at a remark by Cincinnati Reds pitcher Ray Kolp, and – upon reaching first base after hitting a single – he charged into the Reds dugout, punching Kolp several times before they could be separated. Later that evening at the train station, Wilson exchanged words <b>and</b> <b>blows</b> with Cincinnati player Pete Donohue. In late 1929 he signed a contract to fight Art Shires of the Chicago White Sox in a boxing match, but reneged after Cubs president William Veeck, Sr. enlisted Hack's wife Virginia to dissuade him, and then Shires lost a fight to George Trafton of the Chicago Bears. There was nothing to gain, Wilson said, by fighting a defeated boxer.|$|E

25|$|Further {{down in the}} Kobuk watershed, {{the river}} worked {{in concert with the}} wind to create one of the more famous landforms in Alaska: the Kobuk Dunes. These large sand dunes are the modern {{ancestor}} of alluvial deposits that became shaped and dominated by an exchange of aeolian and fluvial processes. In moister climates, the river has more water, and thus more power, and cuts down through a sandy bed. In times of drier climate, wind dominates <b>and</b> <b>blows</b> a lot of sediment into a weaker fluvial system, leading to aggradation and floodplain re-distribution.|$|E
