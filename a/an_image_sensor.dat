25|$|A CMOS {{image sensor}} (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) is <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>sensor</b> {{consisting}} {{of an integrated}} circuit containing an array of pixel sensors, each pixel containing a photodetector and an active amplifier. Starting at the same point, they have to convert light into electrons by using the CMOS process. CMOS image sensors {{can be found in}} digital SLR cameras, embedded web-cams, video cameras, automotive safety systems, swallowable-pill cameras, toys and video games, and wireless video-security networks. The renowned American physicist and engineer Eric Fossum invented the CMOS image sensor while working at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. On January 28, 1994, Fossum filed U.S. patent #5,471,515, which was issued to him on November 28, 1995.|$|E
25|$|The {{digital camera}} is a camera that takes video or still photographs, {{digitally}} by recording <b>images</b> via <b>an</b> electronic <b>image</b> <b>sensor.</b> Steven Sasson {{as an engineer}} at Eastman Kodak invented and built the first digital camera using <b>a</b> CCD <b>image</b> <b>sensor</b> in 1975.|$|R
50|$|A {{camera with}} <b>a</b> full-frame <b>image</b> <b>sensor,</b> and <b>a</b> camera with <b>an</b> APS-C <b>image</b> <b>sensor,</b> {{may have the}} same pixel count (for example, 16 MP), but the full-frame camera may allow better dynamic range, less noise, and {{improved}} low-light shooting performance than an APS-C camera. This is because the full-frame camera has <b>a</b> larger <b>image</b> <b>sensor</b> than the APS-C camera, therefore more information can be captured per pixel. A full-frame camera that shoots photographs at 36 megapixels has roughly the same pixel size as an APS-C camera that shoots at 16 megapixels.|$|R

2500|$|The terms {{scanning}} aperture and sampling aperture {{are often}} {{used to refer to}} the opening through which an image is sampled, or scanned, for example in a Drum scanner, <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>sensor,</b> or a television pickup apparatus. [...] The sampling aperture can be a literal optical aperture, that is, a small opening in space, or it can be a time-domain aperture for sampling a signal waveform.|$|E
2500|$|A {{charge-coupled}} device (CCD) is a device {{for the movement}} of electrical charge, usually from within the device to {{an area where the}} charge can be manipulated. This is achieved by [...] "shifting" [...] the signals between stages within the device one at a time. CCDs move charge between capacitive bins in the device, with the shift allowing for the transfer of charge between bins. Often the device is integrated with <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>sensor,</b> such as a photoelectric device to produce the charge that is being read, thus making the CCD a major technology for digital imaging. First conceived in its usefulness for computer memory, the charge coupled device was co-invented in 1969 by American physicist George E. Smith and Canadian physicist Willard Boyle at AT Bell Laboratories.|$|E

Compressive sensing is a {{powerful}} sensing and reconstruction framework for recovering high dimensional signals with {{only a handful of}} observations and for spectral imaging, compressive sensing offers a novel method of multispectral imaging.

40|$|A delta-sigma {{modulation}} analog-to-digital converter (ADC) has many benefits {{over the use}} of a pipeline ADC in <b>a</b> CMOS <b>image</b> <b>sensor.</b> These benefits include lower power, noise reduction, ease of maximizing the input range, and simpler signal routing for large arrays. Multiple {{delta-sigma modulation}} ADCs are required in <b>a</b> CMOS <b>image</b> <b>sensor,</b> one for each pixel column. Any voltage threshold mismatch between ADCs will introduce gain and offset errors in the ADC 2 ̆ 7 s transfer function. These errors will lead to fixed-pattern noise. Correcting gain and offset error for every ADCs in the <b>image</b> <b>sensor</b> will require <b>a</b> complex digital signal processor. This thesis presents techniques to minimize the effects of gain and offset errors in delta-sigma modulation ADCs for CMOS <b>image</b> <b>sensors...</b>|$|R
