The first concerns the freight delivery parking <b>area</b> <b>set-aside</b> requirements when constructing new commercial buildings over 500  m 2, new hotels with over 150 rooms, or new offices over 2, 500  m 2.The second aims to preserve rail and waterway transport sites within Paris, and to accommodate their logistic activities. Historically, Paris developed around industrial and logistics sites, particularly the Seine River, rail yards, and canals. Many of these sites have now become housing developments or green spaces, or are being used for public amenities. The few that remain have fallen into disuse and are not up to minimum operational standards. Thus, logistics firms have continued to leave the urban centre, moving to the inner, then the outer suburbs. Due to increasing distances between warehouses and delivery points within urban areas, truck-kms in the Ile-de-France Region have increased along with the associated external effects: energy consumption, pollution, noise, greenhouse gas emissions, and consumption of available space [10]. In order to reserve urban logistics spaces in the Paris PLU, it was necessary to make political trade-offs and strike a balance between these spaces and other developments such as housing and office space. The Paris PLU now includes these logistics sites in “Major Urban Service Zones” which are dedicated to public amenities. Thirteen shared transloading sites were also designated along the Seine, on a strip between the Bercy and Grenelle bridges. These facilities can be used at certain times to transfer goods between boats and delivery vehicles, but are available for other uses at other times.|$|E

40|$|Unlike other {{resources}} such as petroleum, coal, and copper, forests are renewable. Yet, in many respects forests historically have been treated as a nonrenewable resource in that forest stocks were depleted or "mined" and loggers moved on to exploit other "deposits. " The lands were often put to other uses, typically agricultural, or allowed to regenerate naturally. This paper looks at technical change in forest extraction, i. e., logging under {{a number of different}} conditions. It finds that, on average, labor productivity has been increasing in recent decades. However, total factor productivity in the US has declined in recent years. In addition, the study examines the tree-growing potential of plantation forestry. It finds that there is underway a substantial shift away from the harvesting of old-growth forests and toward intensive forest plantations. Plantations allow for high productivity in tree growing and are being used to offset decreased wood availability due to the inaccessibility and high costs of many old- and second-growth forests. The decreased accessibility reflects not only the impacts of past logging but, perhaps more importantly, the increase in forests in protected <b>area</b> <b>set-asides.</b> Additionally, natural forests face increasingly stringent regulations on logging and forest management activities. High-yield intensively managed forests, on well located, high productivity sites, offer the potential of obtaining high yields while using relatively small land areas by allowing the near full output potential of practices including species selection, fertilization and pest control. Finally, tree planting creates the opportunity to apply genetic improvements to the tree stock thereby further increasing growth productivity and allowing for control of tree characteristics. ...|$|R

Secondly, voluntary and formally <b>set-aside</b> <b>areas</b> for biodiversity conservation in FSC certified State Forest Enterprises (SFE) were compared.

The formally <b>set-aside</b> <b>area</b> was more than two times larger than voluntary. Structural habitat analysis showed that the most set-aside patches were smaller than 10 ha and had a small fraction of old forests.

Moreover formal forest protection, due to several protection levels does not provide the same conservation measures, while voluntary set-asides are treated evenly.

Next, these scenarios were used as an input for a spatially distributed sediment delivery model in order to evaluate their impact on soil erosion and sediment delivery.

40|$|In {{the case}} of a land {{constraint}} economy such as the Philippines, the efficient allocation of land to its various uses is essential. This constraint is further intensified by the growing population and increased demand for commercial land. The process of land classification is only the first step in managing land resources. A computable general equilibrium (CGE) model based on ORANI, a multi-sectoral model belonging to the Johansen class of CGE models was employed to ascertain the economy-wide effects of the reduction in forestry production due to conservation efforts. The paper also attempts to show the relative contribution of population growth and trade policies on deforestation in {{the case of}} the Philippines. The study evaluated some of the forestry policies recommended by the Philippine Master Plan for Forestry Development (1991 - 2015). In theory, the policies formulated would be viable and effective. The problem lies in the implementation especially of reforestation activities, which is the core of the Master Plan. The Philippine forests require intensive regeneration programs to revive the domestic logging industry and conservation programs to protect sensitive areas as well as the establishment of tree plantations. The study evaluated four policies from the Master Plan, namely the implementation of selective logging, imposition of stumpage tax on the forestry sector, lowering of forestry discount rates and the establishment of <b>set-aside</b> <b>areas.</b> The study found that moving into a selective logging regime and the establishment of <b>set-aside</b> <b>areas</b> would achieve forest conservation with little reduction in economic growth.

40|$|Public {{procurement}} {{can be used}} {{to achieve}} goals other than purely economic ones. Such goals are often referred to as “social linkages”. A preference for social considerations has been gaining ground against the dominant best value for money (BVM) paradigm over the past few decades. In the past, public procurement policies followed the principle of non-discrimination and free competition beyond national boundaries. Today considerations other than (purely economic) BVM have become relevant in public procurement policy and practice. Examples of social linkages in public procurement are found in various countries, from the well-known ‘Affirmative Action Programs’ in the US that advance minorities, women, persons with disabilities and veterans, 1 to specific set-aside programs made available to only less-competitive businesses, such as women-owned businesses, minority-owned businesses, businesses operating in economically disadvantaged <b>areas,</b> etc. <b>Set-asides</b> can be seen as social procurement linkages through the promotion of both supplier diversity and employment. The latter means that social use of public procurement can positively impact employment by providing opportunities to workers who are generally excluded from the labour market, while the former means that chances are given to less-competitive bidders. Set-aside programs have been widely developed in the US, which has a long tradition of set-aside contracts for special classes of small businesses, including small disadvantaged businesses, and in Canada where set-asides have been introduced for the development of Aboriginal businesses. However, the restriction of full and open competition that set-asides entail is frequently criticized by EU institutions.

The study presents new data on, and insights into, the implications of the CAP for land use and land management on subsidy-dependent agricultural zones of Central Spain, particularly how this policy has impacted soil erosion and degradation since 1992. In many parts of cereal-growing Central Spain, an area of Mediterranean continental climate, set-aside land management techniques aimed at increasing soil moisture and fertility have been related to increased susceptibility to soil erosion. In order to quantify the effects CAP reform policies and the subsequent increase in set-aside have had on soil erosion rates within a study watershed, land use as a result of policy implementation was used in calculating the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) in a GIS. Other land use scenarios were simulated to estimate the effects that modifications to set-aside management might have on overall erosion in the study watershed. Results indicate that post-CAP land use led to an increase in the amount of land in high erosion rate categories.

The focus is on how this land change has impacted the soil erosion risk since 1992. In many parts of cereal-growing central Spain, with Mediterranean continental climate, set-aside land management is managed as unseeded fallow, a management type used to increase soil moisture and fertility for subsequent rotations. Unseeded fallow land management has also been related to increased susceptibility to soil erosion. In order to quantify the effects CAP reform policies have had on erosion rates, land changes from 1991 to 1998 were used to calculate annual rates of erosion susceptibility using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) in a geographic information systems (GIS) environment within a study watershed.

40|$|The article {{describes}} the evolution and future of the set-aside system of the European Union. The focus is on Finland s integration to the system. The future developments are evaluated from Finland s point of view. To {{be eligible for the}} compensatory payments introduced as part of the CAP reform for arable crops, producers must set aside a portion of their arable land with a view to achieving a better balance between production and domestic and international demand. The set-aside rate was fixed at 15 % for the rotational set-aside and 20 % (18 % in the UK and Denmark) for other forms of set-aside. The set-aside requirements do not appeal small producers producing less than 92 tons cereals a year. Because of bad harvests in certain areas of the world combined with effective production control measures, for the marketing year 1995 / 96, the set-aside rate was cut to 12 % (15 % and 17 %). During the year 1995, the intervention stocks of cereals continuously decreased and world market prices increased. Consequently, the EU decided to cut the set-aside rate to 10 % for the 1996 / 97 marketing year. As usual, the reduction only applies for the 1996 / 97 marketing year. For the year 1997 / 98, the portion will automatically revert to 15 % (and 18 % and 20 %). The cut of set-aside rate serve the interest of major cereals- producing countries. Finland is obliged to pay her share of the costs without getting any advantage. Finland s interest would probably be to increase the set-aside rate. This is because, within a certain range, (a) the change of the obligatory set-aside rate barely affects the <b>set-aside</b> <b>area</b> in Finland; (b) the change of the obligatory set-aside rate barely affects the cereals production in Finland; and (c) the change of the cereals-production area barely affects the farm income in Finland. The discussion concerning the future development of the EU set-aside system should include the following themes: (a) is the current cereals shortage a temporal or continuous phenomenon; (b) as a high set-aside rate helps to keep cereal prices up, farmers would gain in the form of high producer prices and the tax payers would gain in the form of low export subsidies (or high export taxes); (c) because the increase of set-aside rate is more difficult than the cut, the cuts should be postpo ned if possible; (b) an alternative way to increase production is to rise the farm-by-farm ceiling of 92 tons (that makes the set-aside obligatory), rather than to cut the set-aside rate; and (e) for environmental reasons, the <b>set-aside</b> <b>area</b> shou ld be covered with plants. vokMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL) The temporal cut of the EU set-aside requirements for the 1996 / 97 marketing year: consequences for Finlan...|$|R
40|$|Negative {{consequences}} of intensive forest management on biodiversity are often mitigated by setting aside old forest, but alternative strategies have been suggested. We have compared using simulations the {{consequences of}} two of these alternatives − setting aside young forests or extending rotation periods − to that of current practice in managed boreal forest. In all scenarios we applied a constant conservation budget and predicted forest development and harvesting over 200 years. As a proxy for biodiversity conservation, we projected the extinction risk of a dead wood-dependent beetle, Diacanthous undulatus, in a 50 km 2 landscape in central Sweden, using a colonization-extinction model. During the first century, setting aside young forest stands rather than old stands increased extinction risk because young stands have lower habitat quality. However, habitat quality of young forests increased as they aged and they were much cheaper to set aside than old stands. Therefore, the strategy allowed a larger <b>set-aside</b> <b>area</b> (within the budget constraint), resulting in lower extinction risk and harvested timber volumes in the second century. Prolonging rotations also decreased the extinction risk but was in the long-term less cost-effective. The most cost-effective strategy in the long-term (200 years) was to set aside a mixture of old and young forest. However, setting aside young stands rather than prolonging rotations or setting aside old stands delays both the benefits (lower extinction risk) and costs (lost harvest volumes), so the optimal strategy depends on the assumed societal values and hence discount rates...|$|R
40|$|Many {{farmland}} bird species have declined rapidly throughout Europe {{during the last}} 30 years and studies, mainly from the UK, suggest that these declines {{have been caused by}} agricultural intensification. However, since the conditions for farming vary considerably across Europe, the underlying causes of the population declines may also vary. The rate of agricultural intensification has been less dramatic since the mid 1970 s in Sweden than in south-western Europe. Still, I show that population trends of {{farmland bird}}s have declined at least as much in Sweden as in England between 1976 and 2001. Separating population trends in three Swedish landscape types with different patterns of agricultural change showed that the declines were most pronounced in the open plains characterised by intensification and in the forest farmland landscapes characterised by extensification or abandonment. Thus, the observed strong decline of farmland birds in Sweden was probably caused by the dual negative effects of intensification in productive regions and abandonment in marginal farmland. Several species displayed great temporal similarities in population trends within regions in Sweden and in comparison to England. These between population similarities may have been caused by large-scale effects of changing agricultural policies, as farmland bird population trend shifts were closely linked to agricultural policy shifts in Sweden and western Europe. However, {{it is also possible that}} reduced survival at wintering grounds may have had an additional effect because it was especially species that shared European wintering grounds that displayed the strongest between population synchrony in trends. Several farmland bird populations decreased less or even increased during the set-aside policy period (1987 to 1995) when agricultural became less intensive. However, a repeated census of farmland birds between 1994 and 2004 suggested that a general reduction of farming intensity, e. g. by increasing <b>area</b> of <b>set-aside,</b> leys and cultivated pasture, mainly benefit farmland birds in farmland-dominated landscapes where such land-use is rare, whereas a reduced farming intensity was negative for species richness in forest-dominated landscapes. In contrast, in forest-dominated landscapes farmland bird species seemed to benefit from an increased area of cereal production. My results of landscape–dependent patterns of relationships between farmland bird population changes and changes in land-use highlights the importance of developing new region-specific agri-environmental schemes. The results also suggest that an effective way of changing the present negative trends of farmland birds is a broad change in agricultural policy to reverse the geographical polarisation of farming activities...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the high levels of biodiversity and the ecological functions of tropical forest landscapes in South East Asia, production forests need to be managed in a more sustainable way. Numerous initiatives already exist in the form of codes of practice, criteria and indicators, and certification schemes in the countries of South East Asia, but to date such guidelines and standards have been vague and have lacked quantitative targets. Reducedimpact logging (RIL) is a concept related to techniques and practices that aim to achieve environmentally sound timber harvesting; the concept has gained broad acceptance in the tropics. As yet, however, RIL guidelines have focused mainly on environmental aspects such as soil and water, and have taken the flora and fauna into account to a minor degree only. In this report, detailed recommendations are made to help forest managers take account of biodiversity conservation in dipterocarp logged-over and primary natural forests where mechanised logging is practised. The recommendations are based on those made in the CIFOR publication Life after Logging, further developed through three workshops held under a joint project between the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, CIFOR and the Forest Science Institute of Vietnam. The recommendations are linked to the different phases of the forestry cycle: i. e. planning (inventories of sensitive species and habitats, delimitation of <b>set-aside</b> <b>areas</b> and riparian buffers), infrastructure (logging camps, roads, bridges, skid-trails, landings), logging (retention of critical structures, micro-habitats, key resources, felling techniques, harvesting intensity, site-adaption), post-logging (understorey slashing, rehabilitation of log-landings and stream crossings, re-forestation), and monitoring (biodiversity inventories).

The extended integrated model combines hydrological processes, crop and vegetation growth, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus cycles and soil organic matter turnover. It {{is based on a}} three level spatial disaggregation scheme (basin, subbasin and hydrotopes), whereas a hydrotope is a set of elementary units in the subbasin with a uniform land use and soil type.

Model use is illustrated in this paper with an analysis of the impacts of the CAP reform of 2003 for arable and livestock farms in a context of market liberalization. Results from the application of the model to representative farms in Flevoland (the Netherlands) and Midi-Pyrenees (France) shows that CAP reform 2003 under market liberalization will cause substantial substitution of root crops and durum wheat by vegetables and oilseed crops. Much of the <b>set-aside</b> <b>area</b> will be put into production intensifying the existing farming systems. Abolishment of the milk quota system will cause an increase of the average herd size. The average total gross margin of farm types in Flevoland decreases while the average total gross margin of farms in Midi-Pyrenees increases. The results show that the model can simulate arable and livestock farm types of two regions different from a bio-physical and socio-economic point of view and it can deal with a variety of policy instruments. The examples show that the model can be (re-) used as a basis for future research and as a comprehensive tool for future policy analysi...|$|R
40|$|Research on common-pool {{resources}} in the last 30 years has hinged on concepts such as rules and property rights for understanding how access and use of natural resources is managed by communities and other actors. However, a small body of literature on mobile pastoralism maintains that resource governance might not always be based on resource-related rules, but instead on negotiation and general norms of reciprocity. Situations conventionally labelled as ‘open access’ might therefore not always be as unregulated and unmanaged as they seem. Here, we examine what the absence of rules for resource access and use means in practice, and how resource users adapt such a governance system to increasing scarcity of pasture land. We conducted interviews, group discussions and participatory mapping exercises in two neighbouring areas, Hamar and Bashada, in the lower Omo area in southern Ethiopia. Both groups are culturally closely related to each other, but showed important differences in their ability and willingness to change their institutions to adapt to resource scarcity. In both Hamar and Bashada, access to grazing was generally non-exclusive. Instead, we found a complex mosaic {{of ways in which}} access to grazing was practiced and sanctioned, characterised largely by negotiations and interplay between individual actors rather than by firm rules. Both groups were confronted with increasingly erratic rainfalls and insufficient availability of pasture. Strikingly, while the Bashada had recently established a strictly enforced <b>set-aside</b> <b>area</b> to provide grazing {{for the end of the}} dry season, the Hamar rejected such ideas and sought grazing in protected areas, which eventually led to conflict between herders and authorities. Reasons for these diverging strategies might be connected to subtle differences in the degree to which decision-making is individualised and social coordination accepted. These seem to have important implications for community adaptability to changing environmental and societal conditions...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC) plays {{a crucial role}} in the global carbon cycle as a {{potential}} sink or source. Land management influences SOC storage, so the European Parliament decided in 2013 that changes in carbon stocks within a certain land use type, including arable land, must be reported by all member countries in their national inventory reports for greenhouse gas emissions. Here we show the temporal dynamics of SOC during the past 2 decades in Swedish agricultural soils, based on soil inventories conducted in 19881997 (Inventory I), 2001 - 2007 (Inventory II) and from 2010 onwards (Inventory III), and link SOC changes with trends in agricultural management. From Inventory I to Inventory II, SOC increased in 16 out of 21 Swedish counties, while from Inventory I to Inventory III it increased in 18 out of 21 counties. Mean topsoil (0 - 20 cm) SOC concentration for the entire country increased from 2. 48 to 2. 67 % C (a relative increase of 7. 7 %, or 0. 38 % yr(- 1)) over the whole period. We attributed this to a substantial increase in ley as a proportion of total agricultural area in all counties. The horse population in Sweden has more than doubled since 1981 and was identified as the main driver for this management change (R- 2 = 0. 72). Due to subsidies introduced in the early 1990 s, the <b>area</b> of long-term <b>set-aside</b> (mostly old leys) also contributed to the increase in area of ley. The carbon sink function of Swedish agricultural soils demonstrated in this study differs from trends found in neighbouring countries. This indicates that country-specific or local socio-economic drivers for land management must be accounted for in larger-scale predictions...|$|R
40|$|Changing {{land use}} and land cover in Ethiopia {{triggered}} by many centuries of cultivation and heavy livestock grazing pressure are proximate causes for desertification in the driest {{parts of the country}} and severe dryland degradation elsewhere. In Northern Ethiopia, and in particular in the northernmost regional state Tigray, this tendency is slowed down or reversed by a set-aside policy. Land rehabilitation efforts in exclosures, where removal of remnant vegetation and free grazing is no longer permitted or strictly controlled, aim at restoring the natural pre-disturbance vegetation, which is often presumed to be a dry Afromontane forest. In these degraded landscapes, forest rehabilitation mainly depends on seed dispersal from nearby forest patches into the exclosures, since climax tree species are not present in the soil seed bank. Like in many tropical and subtropical regions, long distance seed dispersal by animals may have the potential to facilitate recolonisation of native vegetation. Particularly in fragmented landscapes, the contribution of birds may be essential. Higher sapling densities of a fleshy-fruited tree species near gullies along the natural drainage pattern of the landscape suggest that avian seed dispersers use these features as preferential pathways, although we could not uncouple high sapling densities from higher shrub densities close to gullies. A detailed survey of the avifauna in forest relics and matrix sites confirmed that bird communities in gullies and exclosures share more species with forests than the surrounding grazing lands, in particular important seed dispersers which tend to avoid open areas. Although gullies are usually related to land degradation, we conclude that, if properly managed, gullies and their associated vegetation may have an important corridor function and thus contribute to forest rehabilitation by increasing the connectivity between forest relics and <b>set-aside</b> <b>areas.</b> In addition to gully stabilisation, gully vegetation may act as a seed source for lateral forest expansion during later stages of development. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) {{is one of}} {{the leading}} forest {{certification}} schemes. While many studies concern political aspects and social outcomes of FSC, little is known about the contribution of certification to biodiversity conservation. In Europe, the Russian Federation and Sweden have the largest areas of FSC certified forest. We assessed the potential of FSC certification for boreal biodiversity conservation in terms of standard content, and outcomes as habitat area set aside and habitat network functionality. First, we compared the biodiversity conservation indicators at different spatial scales in Swedish and Russian FSC standards. Second, focusing on one large state forest management unit in each country, we compared the areas of formally and voluntarily set aside forests for biodiversity conservation. Third, we evaluated the structural habitat connectivity by applying morphological spatial pattern analysis, and potential functional connectivity by using habitat suitability index modelling for virtual species. The Russian standard included indicators for all spatial scales of biodiversity conservation, from tree and stand to land-scape and ecoregions. The Swedish standard focused mainly on stand and tree scales. The <b>area</b> of voluntary <b>set-asides</b> for FSC was similar in Sweden and Russia, while formal protection in the Russian case study was three times higher than in the Swedish one. Swedish <b>set-aside</b> core <b>areas</b> were two orders of magnitude smaller, had much lower structural and potential functional connectivity and were located in a fragmented forestland holding. We conclude that to understand the potential of FSC certification for biodiversity conservation both the standard content, and its implementation on the ground, need to be assessed. We discuss the potential of FSC certification for biodiversity conservation with different levels of ambition. We stress the need for developing rapid assessment tools to evaluate outcomes of FSC for biodiversity conservation on the ground, which could be used by forest managers and FSC-auditors toward adaptive governance and management...|$|R
40|$|Saproxylic beetles {{constitute}} {{a significant proportion}} of boreal forest biodiversity. However, the long history of timber production in Fennoscandia has significantly reduced the availability of dead wood and is considered a threat to the conservation of saproxylic beetle assemblages. Therefore, since the mid- 1990 s dead wood retention in harvested stands has formed an integral part of silvicultural practices. However, the contribution of this biodiversity- orientated management approach to conserving saproxylic beetle assemblages in boreal forest landscapes that include production forestry remains largely untested. We examined differences in resident saproxylic beetle assemblages among stands under different management in a boreal forest landscape in Central Sweden, and in particular stands managed according to new conservation- orientated practices. We also investigated the relationship between beetle diversity and forest stand characteristics. Bark of coarse woody debris (CWD) was sieved for beetles in old managed stands, unmanaged nature reserves, and <b>set-aside</b> <b>areas,</b> and clear-cut stands harvested according to certification guidelines [new forestry (NF) clear-cuts]. All stand types contributed significantly to the total diversity of beetles found. While stand size, position, and distance to nearest reserve were unimportant, both the quality and the quantity of CWD in stands contributed significantly to explaining beetle abundance and species richness. This extends the previous findings for red-listed invertebrates, and shows that heterogeneous substrate quality and a range of management practices are necessary to maintain saproxylic beetle diversity in boreal forest landscapes that include production forestry. The unique abiotic conditions in combination with the abundant and varied CWD associated with NF clear-cuts form an important component of forest stand heterogeneity for saproxylic beetles. It is thus essential that sufficient, diverse, CWD is retained in managed boreal landscapes to ensure the conservation of boreal saproxylic beetle assemblages. © 2007 The Authors. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Forests in boreal and {{temperate}} forest-ecosystems have {{an important}} function since they sequester atmospheric carbon by uptake of carbon-dioxide in photosynthesis, and transfer and store carbon in the forest ecosystem. Forest material {{can be used for}} bio-fuel purposes and substitute fossil fuels, and supply wood products, which can replace carbon- and energy-intensive materials. Therefore it is vital to consider the role of forests regarding today´s aim to mitigate climate change. This thesis assess (i) how climate change affects future forest carbon balance, (ii) the importance of different strategies for forest management systems, and biomass production for the carbon balance, (iii) how the use of forest production affect the total carbon balance in a lifecycle perspective, and (iv) how the Swedish carbon balance is affected from the standpoint of both the actual use of forest raw material within Sweden and what Swedish forestry exports. The analysis was made mainly in a long-term perspective (60 - 300 year) to illustrate the importance of temporal and also the spatial perspective, as the analysis includes stand level, landscape level, and national level. In this thesis, forestry was considered a system. All activities, from forest regeneration to end use of forest products, were entities of this system. In the evaluation, made from a systems perspective, we used life-cycle analysis to estimate carbon stock in different system flows. Different forest management systems and forest production were integrated in the analyses. Different forest management scenarios were designed for the Swedish forest management in combination with the effect of future climate change; (i) intensive forest practice aiming at increased growth, (ii) increased forest <b>set-aside</b> <b>areas,</b> changes in forest management systems for biomass production, and (iii) how the use of forest production affect the total carbon balance (construction material, bioenergy and other domestic use). The results showed that future climate changes and intensive forest management with increased production could increase the biomass production and the potential use of forest raw material. This has a positive effect on carbon storage for the forest carbon stock, litter production and carbon storage in the ground etc. and help mitigating carbon-dioxide. Increased forest <b>set-aside</b> <b>areas</b> can increase the short-term carbon stock in forest ecosystems, but will reduce the total long-term carbon balance. The net carbon balance for clear-cut forestry did not differ significantly from continuous-cover forestry, but was rather a question of level of growth. Most important, in the long term, was according to our analysis, how forest raw material is used. Present Swedish forestry and use of forest raw material, both within Sweden and abroad, reduce carbon-dioxide emissions and mitigate climate change. The positive effect for the total carbon balance and climate benefit take place mostly abroad, due to the Swedish high level of export of wood products and the higher substitution effects achieved outside Swedish borders. One strategy is to increase production, harvest and change the use of Swedish forest raw material to replace more carbon intensive material, which can contribute to significant emission reduction. Carbon-dioxide mitigation, as a result of present Swedish forestry, was shown to be almost of the same level as the total yearly emission of greenhouse gases. The total carbon benefit would increase if the biomass production and felling increased and if Swedish wood products replaced carbon intensive materials. This thesis shows also that, by changing forest management, increase the growth and the use of forest raw material and export of forest material we can contribute to even larger climate benefits. In a long-term perspective, the substitution effects and replacement of carbon- and energy-intensive materials are of greater significance than carbon storage effects in forests. A more production oriented forestry needs to make balances and increase the prerequisite for biological diversity, improve recreation possibilities, and protect sensitive land areas and watersheds. Climate benefits, from Swedish forestry, are highly dependent on policy decision-making and how that can steer the direction for the Swedish forestry...|$|R
40|$|Ecological {{restoration}} {{is becoming}} a main component in nature management; hence, its definitions and interpretations of the underlying principles are widely discussed. In Denmark, restoration has been implemented for decades, and the LIFE Nature program has contributed to several large-scale projects. Our aim was to indicate tendencies in Danish nature policy by analyzing {{a representative sample of}} nature management projects. Using qualitative document analyses of official reports, we investigated how well 13 LIFE Nature cofinanced projects undertaken in Denmark fit with the principles of ecological restoration, as formulated in the nine attributes of the Society for Ecological Restoration's Primer on Ecological Restoration, and based on the five myths of ecological restoration. Objectives of the analyzed projects were divided into three categories: conservation of a single or a group of species; restoration of <b>set-aside</b> <b>areas,</b> mainly on abandoned agricultural land; and habitat management of Natura 2000 areas. Despite this grouping, improvement in living conditions for certain species associated with specific nature types was in focus in all projects. No projects considered or fulfilled all nine attributes. It seems that attributes associated with fundamental requirements for the existence of target species or habitats were more often fulfilled than attributes associated with continuity of the ecosystem as a whole, which indicated a focus on ecosystem structures rather than on processes. We found that the two assumptions of a predictable single endpoint (the myth of the Carbon Copy) and that nature is controllable (the myth of Command and Control) were notably frequent in the Danish projects. Often, the target ecosystem was associated with a semicultural landscape, and management focused on keeping the vegetation low and preventing overgrowth of colonizing trees. The results indicated that nature policy in Denmark and the LIFE Nature program are based on a control paradigm, with the focus on structures rather than on processes. Further, the results revealed that the definition and interpretation of ecological restoration is ambiguous, and according to land use history, {{there is a need for}} concepts and approaches to be clearly defined...|$|R
40|$|The {{adjustment}} of Finnish agriculture to the EU membership has largely gone as was expected, {{except that the}} market prices have been somewhat lower than was forecast before joining the EU. This was partly caused by the strengthening of Finnish markka, but the prices of beef, mutton, and eggs have been clearly below the average levels in the EU. Overproduction {{may be one reason}} for the collapse in the price of eggs, {{but in the case of}} beef and especially mutton there is no excess supply that might affect the prices. Livestock production, in particular, has stayed at about the same level as in 1994. The area under cereals grew to some extent, mainly due to the considerable decrease in the required <b>set-aside</b> <b>area.</b> Trade between Finland and the other member states increased as was expected. Especially meat imports increased considerably from the earlier levels. This was made possible by the fact that the decrease in the consumer prices (about 9 % by the end of 1995) led to an increase in the consumption of pigmeat and poultry meat. The trade in dairy products, like cheeses and yoghurt, increased as well. Some decrease occurred in the food imports to Russia and Estonia. During a transitional period of five years a degressive support is paid to agriculture, and in the first year this was quite high. The purpose of the support is to alleviate the {{adjustment of}} farms to the toughening competition in the single market. Because of the support, farm income stayed at about the same level as earlier. Farmers managed the first year as EU members quite well, even if some of the support was postponed to be paid in 1996. Income development looks relatively good still in 1996, but in the long run the situation is likely to be much more difficult. The first year as EU members was characterized by delays in the decisions on support, which led to uncertainty about the income development among farmers. Farmers had to learn to operate in a new bureaucratic system, but things have started to run quite smoothly. Support for the transitional period will keep the incomes at a satisfactory level, but the future involves a great deal of uncertainty. vMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL...|$|R

The crop of 1997 was in {{accordance}} with the long-term trend, despite the cold early part of the summer, which delayed the sowing. After June the weather was hot and the growth was more rapid than usually. The total amount of cereals harvested was 3. 8 bill. kg, and this exceeded that of 1996 by 2. 7 %. The total yield measured as fodder units was 3 % higher than in 1996. There was some increase in both the area and the average yields. The <b>area</b> under <b>set-aside</b> decreased by almost 10 %. Milk production started to grow in 1997. The quantities produced on farms that continued their production grew considerable, because the number of milk suppliers fell by 1, 900. The average yield/cow grew by almost 200 l. In terms of the structural development the high price of milk quotas has been considered problematic, and partly administered quota trade was introduced in 1997. Pigmeat production grew by 5 %. The market prices started to rise in June. There was some increase in beef production, too, but the price of beef decreased from the previous year. Poultry meat consumption continued to grow, and the production also grew by almost 10 %. The decrease in egg production was not large enough to solve the serious market problems due to oversupply. Both agricultural imports and exports grew in 1997. Dairy products, meat, and cereals were imported more than in the previous year. Cereal imports decreased clearly, but the imports of more highly processed foods grew. There were no major changes in the consumer prices or in the consumption. Cheese consumption started to decrease slightly, which is contrary to the trend in the past few years. The consumption of eggs and pigmeat fell, too. The agricultural income in 1997 was about FIM 6. 6 bill., which is about 1 % lower than in 1996. The production volume grew, but the agricultural aid declined. The prices of production inputs rose by about 2 %, and the producer prices fell a little over 1 %. More investments were made in agriculture than for a long time. Investments were encouraged by public aid. In 1997 loans and subsidies were granted for altogether 15, 000 projects, and the cost estimates of these totaled FIM 4. 2 bill. The aid amounted to over FIM 900 mill. Investment aid was mainly directed to increasing the farm size and environmental investments. The small size of Finnish farms affects their competitiveness on the single market, and environmental aid requires considerable investments in livestock production. The year 1997 did not bring along any major changes in agricultural production or prices of the products. The future of Finnish agriculture involves a great deal of uncertainty. National aid consists of many different measures, and the decision on the continuation of many of these must be decided on in the negotiations before the end of 1999. The proposals of the Commission for a reform of the common agricultural policy are difficult for Finland, where agriculture operates in extremely adverse natural conditions. vokMTT Taloustutkimu...|$|R
