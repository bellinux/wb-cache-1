50|$|The DL class {{initially}} had poor reliability with availability only 50% of that of {{the rest}} of the fleet. In one instance a weld on an <b>alternator</b> <b>fan</b> failed resulting in the blade breaking off. As a result, KiwiRail employees were told not to enter the alternator compartment and to keep doors to the area closed when the engine is running. The locomotives also experienced technical problems with a wide variety of internal components. KiwiRail stated that the teething problems were normal on new locomotives and that reliability was improving. The Rail & Maritime Transport Union claimed that the problems were beyond those usually experienced with new locomotives.|$|E
50|$|Earlier LS models had a {{mechanical}} {{engine cooling fan}} that was operated with a hydraulic pump because the electrical charging system did not have sufficient capacity to effectively power an electric fan. Later on, due to an improved <b>alternator</b> design, the <b>fan</b> was changed to an electric version for the 2003-2006 models.|$|R
50|$|The units {{had one or}} {{two other}} unusual {{features}} including hydraulically driven <b>alternators</b> and cooling <b>fans.</b> The main cooler group and radiators were fitted in a pod {{on the roof of}} each vehicle. The bogies were non-standard and this combined with several other unique features led ultimately to their withdrawal in 1989. There were proposals to fit standard Class 150 bogies, however this proved to be impractical.|$|R
50|$|Motor vehicle dynamometers {{can measure}} wheel {{horsepower}}, {{which is the}} effective, true horsepower delivered to the driving wheel(s), representing the actual power available to accelerate the vehicle after all losses in the drive train, and all parasitic losses such as pumps, <b>fans,</b> <b>alternator,</b> muffled exhaust, etc. The vehicle is generally attached to the dynamometer and accelerates a large roller and Power Absorbing Unit which {{is driven by the}} vehicle's drive wheel(s). The actual power is then computer calculated based on the rotational inertia of the roller, its resultant acceleration rates and power applied by the Power Absorbing Unit. Some motor vehicle (and motorbike) dynamometers can also be purely inertia-based where the power output is calculated from measuring the acceleration of a roller drum with a known rotational inertia and known parasitic frictional losses of the roller drum's bearings.|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{that the main}} sources of noise and vibration in canopied Diesel generators are the Diesel engine, the <b>fan</b> and the <b>alternator.</b> This paper focuses on the flanking transmission of noise and vibration from the sources to the canopy and baseframe. The canopy is basically a combination of large rectangular steel plates which behave as noise radiating panels converting vibration into noise which then radiates into the environment. The objective of the research is to identify the main transmission paths and correlate noise and vibration levels. For this purpose a number of measurement positions have been located on the engine, <b>fan,</b> <b>alternator,</b> AVMs, baseframe, canopy and other relevant parts in order to observe levels of noise and vibration. Measurements of the attenuation or amplification of vibration and hence noise radiation has enabled critical areas {{to be identified as}} well as overall noise levels in the vicinity of diesel-generator sets...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} way of engine rating {{is what is}} known as the brake power, {{measured}} at the flywheel, and given in kilowatts (metric) or horsepower (Imperial/USA). This is the actual mechanical power output of the engine in a usable and complete form. The term [...] "brake" [...] comes from the use of a brake in a dynamometer test to load the engine. For accuracy, it is important to understand what is meant by usable and complete. For example, for a car engine, apart from friction and thermodynamic losses inside the engine, power is absorbed by the water pump, <b>alternator,</b> and radiator <b>fan,</b> thus reducing the power available at the flywheel to move the car along. Power is also absorbed by the power steering pump and air conditioner (if fitted), but these are not installed for a power output test or calculation. Power output varies slightly according to the energy value of the fuel, the ambient air temperature and humidity, and the altitude. Therefore, there are agreed standards in the USA and Europe on the fuel to use when testing, and engines are rated at 25 ⁰C (Europe), and 64 ⁰F (USA) at sea level, 50% humidity. Marine engines, as supplied, usually have no radiator fan, and often no alternator. In such cases the quoted power rating does not allow for losses in the radiator <b>fan</b> and <b>alternator.</b> The SAE in USA, and the ISO in Europe publish standards on exact procedures, and how to apply corrections for deviating conditions like high altitude.|$|R
