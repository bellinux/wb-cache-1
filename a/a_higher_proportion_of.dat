5|$|Balaenids rely {{on their}} huge heads, {{as opposed to the}} rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This feeding {{behavior}} allows them to grow very big and bulky, without the necessity for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. Rorquals have <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the rorquals, their throat pleats increase the capacity of their throats, allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn on their sides, scoop up sediment into their mouths and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads.|$|E

5|$|The {{first series}} {{received}} a mixed critical reception, with some reviewers concerned {{that it is}} too derivative and predictable, while others were more positive. The producers were happy to have started well, survived the ratings lull in the middle, and ended with an upward curve in the last two weeks. Audience breakdowns indicate that <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> younger viewers were tuning in to Survivors than many other shows.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{region of}} the Solar System {{is home to the}} giant planets and their large moons. The centaurs and many short-period comets also orbit in this region. Due to their greater {{distance}} from the Sun, the solid objects in the outer Solar System contain <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> volatiles, such as water, ammonia, and methane than those of the inner Solar System because the lower temperatures allow these compounds to remain solid.|$|E
5|$|This {{nocturnal bird}} of prey hunts mainly rodents, usually by {{dropping}} from a perch to seize its prey, which it swallows whole; in more urban areas its diet includes <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> birds.

5|$|According to the Kennel Club Purebred Dog Health Survey {{conducted}} in 2004, the two breeds had similar average lifespans: {{the median age}} at death was 12 years 3 months for Pembrokes, and 12 years 2 months for Cardigans. The {{main causes of death}} were similar in both breeds: the primary causes were canine cancer and old age. However, the Pembroke breed showed <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> deaths attributed to either kidney failure or a urethral obstruction.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ocreata {{is highly}} toxic, {{and has been}} {{responsible}} for mushroom poisonings in western North America, particularly in the spring. It contains highly toxic amatoxins, as well as phallotoxins, a feature shared with the closely related death cap (A. phalloides), half a cap of which can be enough to kill a human, and other species known as destroying angels. There is some evidence it may be the most toxic of all the North American phalloideae, as <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> people consuming it had organ damage and 40% perished. Dogs have also been known to consume this fungus in California with fatal results.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its small}} size, the least weasel is a fierce hunter, capable {{of killing a}} rabbit five to ten times its own weight. Although they are {{commonly}} taken, the rabbits are usually young specimens, and become an important food source during the spring, when small rodents are scarce and rabbit kits are plentiful. Male least weasels take <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> rabbits than females, {{as well as an}} overall greater variety of prey. This is linked to the fact that being larger, and having vaster territorial ranges than females, males have more opportunities to hunt a greater diversity of prey.|$|E

5|$|For atoms {{with low}} atomic numbers, a nucleus {{that has more}} {{neutrons}} than protons tends to drop to a lower energy state through radioactive decay so that the neutron–proton ratio is closer to one. However, as the atomic number increases, <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> neutrons is required to offset the mutual repulsion of the protons. Thus, there are no stable nuclei with equal proton and neutron numbers above atomic number Z = 20 (calcium) and as Z increases, the neutron–proton ratio of stable isotopes increases. The stable isotope with the highest proton–neutron ratio is lead-208 (about 1.5).|$|E
5|$|Grasses {{generally}} comprise {{at least}} 80 {{percent of the}} hartebeest's diet, but they account for over 95 percent of their food in the wet season, October to May. Jasminum kerstingii {{is part of the}} hartebeest's diet {{at the start of the}} rainy season. Between seasons, they mainly feed on the culms of grasses. A study found that the hartebeest is able to digest <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> food than the topi and the wildebeest. In areas with scarce water, it can survive on melons, roots, and tubers.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the large fluctuations in Haumea's light curve due to the body's shape, which affect all colours equally, smaller independent colour variations seen in both visible and near-infrared wavelengths show a region on the surface that differs both in colour and in albedo. More specifically, a large dark red area on Haumea's bright white surface was seen in September 2009, possibly an impact feature, which indicates an area rich in minerals and organic (carbon-rich) compounds, or possibly <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> crystalline ice. Thus Haumea may have a mottled surface reminiscent of Pluto, if not as extreme.|$|E

5|$|Planetary geologists have {{measured}} the relative quantities of oxygen isotopes in {{samples from the}} Earth, the Moon, Mars, and meteorites, but were long unable to obtain reference values for the isotope ratios in the Sun, {{believed to be the}} same as those of the primordial solar nebula. Analysis of a silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space and returned by the crashed Genesis spacecraft has shown that the Sun has <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> oxygen-16 than does the Earth. The measurement implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen-16 from the Sun's disk of protoplanetary material prior to the coalescence of dust grains that formed the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{is prone}} to skin disorders. About a quarter of Westies {{surveyed}} are affected by atopic dermatitis, a heritable chronic allergic skin condition. <b>A</b> <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> males are affected compared to females. An uncommon but severe breed-specific skin condition, hyperplastic dermatosis, may affect West Highland White Terriers, both juveniles and adults dogs. Affected dogs can suffer from red hyperpigmentation, lichenification, and hair loss. In the initial stages, this condition can be misdiagnosed as allergies or less serious forms of dermatitis.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} use of supplemental vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D or vitamin E does not {{reduce the risk}} of lung cancer. Some studies suggest that people who eat diets with <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> vegetables and fruit tend to have a lower risk, but {{this may be due to}} confounding—with the lower risk actually due to the association of a high fruit/vegetables diet with less smoking. Several rigorous studies have not demonstrated a clear association between diet and lung cancer risk, although meta-analysis that accounts for smoking status may show benefit from a healthy diet.|$|E
