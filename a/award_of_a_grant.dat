50|$|The <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>grant,</b> by the Institut Français in Madrid, enabled Berrocal {{to travel}} to Paris in 1955. Plunging into the {{stimulating}} atmosphere that the city offered him, he continued {{his work as a}} painter. He frequently saw the sculptors Cárdenas and Giacometti and many others. He returned to Rome, where he met Afro, Burri, Guerrini and other artists. He worked for various established architects, and with a group of young companions, he prepared an entry for a project for the construction of the Chamber of Commerce in Carrara. For the ornamentation of the facade, the 22-year-old Berrocal invented a solution for the Balaustradas. His work was based on eight modules with which he obtained a number of permutations and combinations that far exceeded the requirement to make each of the building's balustrades different from the others. In 1957, he exhibited his first sculptures, in wrought iron, at the Galleria La Medusa, in Rome. The works that he produced during the summer, in the studio he rented in Mougins on the Côte d’Azur, concluded his cycle of activity as a painter. At this time he succeeded in being received by Picasso at La Californie. He returned to Rome and from then on concentrated on sculpture. Works made in this period included La Boîte découpée, Sarcophage and Grand Torse. These works mark the transition from the analysis of the problem of filled and empty space, and the multiplicity of positions of a single sculpture, to the problem of the combinatorial possibility of different volumes.|$|E
5000|$|It took until 1984 {{to raise}} the first £4 million. After {{that the size of}} {{donations}} tended to be larger. {{and by the end of}} 2005 a total of over £27 million had been raised. In 2000 alone over £2.2 million was received. The size of grants made to churches has varied greatly. Up to 2005 the smallest grant had been £33 4s 4d to a church in Mileham, Norfolk, in 1957, and the largest grants were of £100,000 each to a church in Portsea, Portsmouth, Hampshire, in 2000, and to Selby Abbey in 2005. [...] The criterion for the <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> was [...] "for essential repairs to any place of worship (with the exception of cathedrals) over 100 years old which is of a recognized Christian denomination and is open for public worship". Initially available only to churches in England, the scheme was extended to churches and chapels in Wales in 1987. The decision to award a grant is made by the Trust's Grants committee. Some of the churches that have been helped are now closed and have been declared redundant. These are now cared for by the Churches Conservation Trust. In 1983 the Historic Churches Preservation Trust took over the management of the Incorporated Church Building Society. This had been founded in 1818 to assist Anglican churches of any age, sometimes giving grants for new churches. In the early 1990s a Friends' scheme was instituted. In 2006 the Trust took over the functions of the Open Churches Trust. [...] The Historic Churches Preservation Trust was succeeded by the National Churches Trust in 2007.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The Neotropical Region {{is known}} for its {{biodiversity}} and ranks third in number of known termite species. However, biogeographic and phylogeographic information of termites of this region is limited compared to other world geographic regions. Nasutitermes corniger is widely distributed in the region and is of considerable economic importance. The goal {{of this study was to}} describe the phylogeography of N. corniger in the Neotropical Region, to better understand its evolutionary processes. Results The sampled populations of N. corniger showed high genetic variation. Results indicated strong geographic structure among N. corniger populations, with most haplotypes not broadly shared among separated locations. Phylogeographic analyses showed a dispersal route for N. corniger from Central America into South America via the Isthmus of Panama, with subsequent dispersal through the highlands east of the Andes and into eastern regions of the continent. The majority of haplotypes were limited in distribution to proximal regions, corresponding to particular biomes (Atlantic Forest, Amazonia, Chaco, Cerrado and Caatinga). Conclusions Nasutitermes corniger is suggested to be a good model for biogeographic and phylogeographic studies in the Neotropical Region. This study clarified the phylogeographic history of N. corniger and can contribute to the understanding of biogeographic dispersion processes in the Neotropical Region.

40|$|EN] Highly porous carbons {{have been}} {{prepared}} by the chemical activation of two mesoporous carbons obtained by using hexagonal- (SBA- 15) and cubic (KIT- 6) -ordered mesostructured silica as hard templates. These materials were investigated as sorbents for CO 2 capture. The activation process was carried out with KOH at different temperatures in the 600 – 800 °C range. Textural characterization of these activated carbons shows {{that they have a}} dual porosity made up of mesopores derived from the templated carbons and micropores generated during the chemical activation step. As a result of the activation process, there is an increase in the surface area and pore volume from 1020 m 2 g− 1 and 0. 91 cm 3 g− 1 for the CMK- 8 carbon to a maximum of 2660 m 2 g− 1 and 1. 38 cm 3 g− 1 for a sample activated at 800 °C (KOH/CMK- 8 mass ratio of 4). Irrespective of the type of templated carbon used as precursor or the operational conditions used for the synthesis, the activated samples exhibit similar CO 2 uptake capacities, of around 3. 2 mmol CO 2 g− 1 at 25 °C. The CO 2 capture capacity seems to depend on the presence of narrow micropores (< 1 nm) rather than on the surface area or pore volume of activated carbons. Furthermore, it was found that these porous carbons exhibit a high CO 2 adsorption rate, a good selectivity for CO 2 –N 2 separation and they can be easily regenerated.

40|$|The {{theory of}} speech acts {{put forward by}} Reinach in his "The A Priori Foundations of the Civil Law " rests on a {{systematic}} account of the ontological structures associated with various different 80 rt $ of language use. One of the most original features of Reinach's account lies in hIs demonstration of how the ontological structure of, say, an action of promising or of commanding, may be modified in different ways, yielding different sorts of non-standard instances of the corresponding speech act varieties. The present paper {{is an attempt to}} apply this idea of standard and modified instances of ontological structures to the realm of judgement and cognition. It is hoped that it will also do something to justify the author's belief that Reinach's writings have a more than merely historical interest. It will be presupposed in what follows: (1) that there are certain core situations in which knowledge is gained or secured: principally situations in which objects and states of affairs are directly given in perception; (2) that these core situations are surrounded by a periphery {{of what might be called}} natural deformations: modified, derivative or non-standard cases. These are either cases where things go wrong in standard ways, or they are cases involving greater complexity, for example as a result of the intervention of inference, memory or the testimony of others; (3) that there may occur also isolated cases of unnatural deformations (we might also call them unnatural instances of natural kinds), departing from the relevant standard instances in irregular ways. Aristotle, too, distinguished in his philosophy of nature between regular nonstandard instances, instances which deviate from their kind in a law-governed way I I should like to express my thanks to the Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung for the <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> for research in Louvain and Erlangen, where this paper was written.

The facts of Mozart’s childhood are known and available, however the vast majority of research is devoted to Mozart’s music, life and career during his adult years.
