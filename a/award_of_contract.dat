50|$|As {{a result}} of the study, the COMP (Committee for Economic and Social Policy), Ministry of Finance {{instructed}} the Civil Aeronautics initiation of processes for delivery through concession contracts busiest airports in the country El Dorado International Airport in Bogota, Alfonso Bonilla Aragon International Airport in Cali, Ernesto Cortissoz International Airport in Barranquilla and finally Rafael Nuñez Airport in Cartagena. After the failed bidding process for the Cali airport, it was restarted with Rafael Nunez airport tender on November 14, 1995. Closed on February 26, 1996, with the <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> to the Society Caribbean Airports S.A. (SACSA), which had as its operating partner at Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands. The transfer from the airport to the private operator took effect on September 25, 1996 for a period of 15 years. The first two years were quite complicated, it was the first case of transfer from one airport to private hands. The flow of passengers and number of operations did not coincide with the projections, {{to the detriment of the}} economic balance of the contract and SACSA signature was on the verge of bankruptcy. There need to renegotiate the terms of the contract by the Civil Aeronautics to save the grant. In this process is compounded by the sudden death of the Concession Manager, Eric Okker and replacement of the operator partners. Schiphol withdrew from the project and assumed the role of operating partner, the Spanish company AENA, which during this period had also made the concession of the airport in Barranquilla Ernesto Cortissoz. SACSA Since then the company has handled the airport to make the investments necessary under the Master Plan for airport development, improving air and for the construction of seven bridges of collision, extension and maintenance of the platform of the main runway and taxiways.|$|E

Our results show that inclusion of coordination costs in the analysis is significant in the decision-making framework. We find that variations in supplier capacities do not significantly affect the optimum number of suppliers when there are costs of coordination. Furthermore, we also show that managers do not gain much by pre-qualifying a large pool of suppliers to participate in the procurement process...|$|E

40|$|Internet based marketplaces {{have enabled}} {{industrial}} buyers to locate suppliers from geographically diverse locations.

In this paper we consider three supplier parameters that can affect the price the buyer pays and the number of suppliers that the buyer will select for <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> These attributes are capacity, production cost and demand for supplier’s capacity. We show how these parameters impact the price that a supplier quotes. We also show how the buyer will determine the optimum number of suppliers using a reverse auction mechanism when he does not have perfect knowledge of the suppliers’ parameters. Our model suggests that buyers need to adjust some of the input parameters while procuring capacity from a heterogeneous supply base. For instance, buyers need to pre-qualify more suppliers if the supply base has greater heterogeneity...|$|E

40|$|Competitive fee {{tendering}} {{is gaining}} {{popularity in the}} construction industry as a mechanism for allocating consultancy work to architects, engineers and surveyors. It appears though that many construction industry clients are not fulfilling their responsibilities in providing their tendering consultants with sufficient tendering feedback information. This paper compares the amount of feedback that consultants are receiving from clients with the level of feedback information that consultants want from clients and seeks opinion on whether consultants would welcome certain major public sector clients publishing consultancy award details. A questionnaire sent to Hong Kong quantity surveying consultants reveals that 89 % of consultancy work is allocated through competitive fee tendering. Although the majority of consultants keep systematic records of bid data, only two major Hong Kong construction clients are providing these consultants with detailed feedback information. The vast majority of consultants want information on the number of competing consultants (at the time of issuing tender documents) and identity of the successful consultant and corresponding fee and technical quality score plus the corresponding fee and technical quality scores of all the unsuccessful consultants (after <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract).</b> Opinion is almost equally divided on whether major public sector clients should publish consultancy award details. In addition to the job by job feedback, the vast majority of consultants would also like regular clients of the construction industry to provide them, on a periodic basis, with consolidated tender feedback information in the form of summary statistics.

40|$|The {{process of}} ordering, {{expediting}} {{and delivery of}} materials {{is a very important}} aspect in the successful management of a Construction Project. In regions not near the industrial areas, such as the Island of Newfoundland, the time of delivery of materials from supplier to project can be lengthy and uncertain. [...] Present systems for handling the material procurement process do not always systematically include or provide for all the procedures and their corresponding lengths of time that are necessary in procuring materials such as: [...] Preparation of Shop Drawings [...] Approval of Shop Drawings [...] Fabrication [...] Shipping [...] etc. [...] Consequently, often the procurement of the materials {{is the single most important}} thing which determines the progress of construction.

40|$|Digital {{technologies}} {{are increasingly being}} used to support the execution of {{all aspects of the}} construction procurement process. However, there has been no systematic attempt to identify and catalogue the different digital technologies and tools available for executing construction procurement activities so as to guide those involved in procurement on the options available to support the six basic procurement activities identified in ISO 10845. The method used to identify 36 different digital technologies and tools used in construction procurement was a literature survey involving systematic identification and review of 78 articles published in 52 different sources between 1993 and 2014. The 36 digital technologies and tools identified include ten generic tools used across the procurement process. This is followed by four applications for establishing what is to be procured; four for soliciting tender offers; one for establishment of procurement strategy; two for tender evaluation, two for <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and thirteen for contract administration. The research shows that the majority of existing digital {{technologies are}} web-based applications that facilitate real-time communication and collaboration across construction supply chains. The effort made to map digital technologies with the ISO 10845 framework presents a useful contribution to current discourse on digital technology use in construction procurement. It seems interesting that despite the progress made in the evolution and use of digital technologies in construction, there is still no single digital technology which integrates all six construction procurement activities into a system that procurers can adopt to manage the entire construction procurement lifecycle. This should be addressed...|$|E

CP- 5 was a 5 -megawatt, heavy water-moderated, enriched uranium-fueled reactor used to produce neutrons for scientific research from 1954 [...] 79. The reactor was shut down and defueled in 1979, and placed into a lay-up condition pending funding for decontamination and decommissioning (D and D). In 1990, work was initiated on the D and D of the facility in order to alleviate safety and environmental concerns associated with the site due to {{the deterioration of the}} building and its associated support systems. A decision was made in early Fiscal Year (FY) 1999 to direct focus and resources to the completion of the CP- 5 Reactor D and D Project.
