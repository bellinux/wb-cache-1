2500|$|The {{alkali metal}} ions {{are small and}} mobile; their {{presence}} in glass allows a degree of electrical conductivity, especially in molten state or at high temperature. Their mobility decreases the chemical resistance of the glass, allowing leaching by water and facilitating corrosion. Alkaline earth ions, with their two positive charges and requirement for two non-bridging oxygen ions to compensate for their charge, are much less mobile themselves and also hinder diffusion of other ions, especially the alkalis. The most common commercial glasses contain both alkali and alkaline earth ions (usually sodium and calcium), for easier processing and satisfying corrosion resistance. Corrosion resistance of glass can be increased by dealkalization, removal of the alkali ions from the glass surface by reaction with e.g. sulfur or fluorine compounds. [...] Presence of <b>alkaline</b> <b>metal</b> ions has also detrimental effect to the loss tangent of the glass, and to its electrical resistance; glasses for electronics (sealing, vacuum tubes, lamps...) {{have to take this}} in account.|$|E
50|$|The Q-machine plasma {{is created}} at a plate {{that has been}} heated to about 2000 K and hence is called the hot plate. Electrons are emitted by the hot plate through {{thermionic}} emission, and ions are created through contact ionization of atoms of alkali metals that have low ionisation potentials. The hot plate is made of a metal that has a large work function and can withstand high temperatures, e.g. tungsten or rhenium. The alkali metal is boiled in an oven {{that is designed to}} direct a beam of <b>alkaline</b> <b>metal</b> vapour onto the hot plate. A high value of the hot plate work function and a low ionisation potential of the metal makes for a low potential barrier for an electron in the <b>alkaline</b> <b>metal</b> to overcome, thus making the ionisation process more efficient. Sometimes barium is used instead of an <b>alkaline</b> <b>metal</b> due to its excellent spectroscopic properties.

Several other <b>alkaline</b> <b>metals</b> such as lithium and sodium show similar behaviour when dissolved in amines and in ether solvents.

5000|$|This lamp {{could be}} {{considered}} as a predecessor of modern fluorescent lanterns, because, as in the [...] "Ruhmkorff lamp", modern portable fluorescent lamps use an inverter (oscillator + step-up transformer) to convert low voltage DC current from dry cells or storage batteries into AC or even pulsating current at a voltage high enough as to ionize the gas in the fluorescent tube and thus power it at the required nominal level. Modern portable fluorescent lamps contains neither nitrogen, nor C02, nor uranium glass; instead a modern fluorescent tube is filled with argon at a very low pressure, along with a few milligrams of mercury. The lamp electrodes usually consists of a double or triply coiled tungsten wire covered with substances, such as <b>alkaline</b> <b>metal</b> oxides, that readily emits free electrons, aiding the ionization of the gas and thereby initiating and sustaining the electric arc. The inner walls of the tube are coated with a thin layer of fluorescent substances, which, when they are excited by the 253.7 nm line of UV radiation from a mercury arc, emits visible light, usually in the range of 6500K (daylight) colour temperature.

5000|$|Rosing's {{interest}} in television — or the [...] "electric telescope", {{as he called}} it — began in 1897. Others had tried to develop a mechanical version of television. Rosing recognized the shortcomings of mechanical television; he thought that the image should be displayed electrically on a cathode ray tube (CRT). By 1902, Rosing began actual experimentation to test his ideas: he constructed a simple apparatus for electrically deflecting the beam of a CRT, which allowed him to draw figures on the tube's screen. At that time, mechanical devices scanned an image onto a selenium photoresistor, the resistance of which varied in response to the light striking it. However, selenium photoresistors responded to changes in light levels too slowly to accurately reproduce moving images. Therefore Rosing used a photocell, a piece of <b>alkaline</b> <b>metal</b> in a vacuum tube which emitted electrons in response to light. Once Rosing had developed a rudimentary working television that incorporated his two innovations — a photocell detector and a CRT display — he filed a patent application in Russia on July 25, 1907 and — on the improved version of his system, which included magnetic deflection coils around the CRT — on March 2, 1911. [...] He followed up with a demonstration of which a report was published in the Scientific American with diagrams and full description of the invention's operation. [...] During 1912-1914, he did theoretical and experimental work on magnetic lenses. In 1918, he co-founded the North Caucasian Polytechnic Institute, now the Kuban State Technological University. In the early 1920s he resided in Krasnodar (formerly: Ekaterinodar), near the Black Sea. There, in 1920, he co-founded the Ekaterinodar Physical-Mathematical Society and became its chairman, and in 1923, he wrote his booklet The Electric Telescope: Vision at a distance.|$|E

Many papers developed in this domain were single authored, marking the original perspective of Werner Urland. Briefly, describing the situation of Ligand field theory, practically equivalent to Crystal Field Theory pointing that this method is more popular, often invoked in qualitative respects, for transition metal systems (coordination and solid phase compounds) [...] while for f-elements (lanthanide and actinide compounds) it is regarded as a rather specialized field, due to somewhat more complicated technical stances. A conceptual drawback is the lack of chemical intuitiveness of the parameters of classical ligand field theories. There are several conventions, such as Wybourne or Stevens parameterizations [...] An alternate offer was identified in the Angular Overlap Model basically developed for d-type transition metal systems [...] It is the merit of Werner Urland for stating the AOM version for f-type compounds, advocating for it by systematic applications acting as proof for the validity of this approach. The theoretical activity was complemented by involvement in synthetic coordination chemistry, producing new coordination compounds taken as relevant new case studies for ligand field interpretation of magnetic properties. A series consisting in individual octahedral units LnCl63−, is interesting by the intrinsic simplicity of these complexes, once is known that lanthanide complexes are usually adopting higher coordination numbers, the hexa-coordination being enforced mostly by the doping regime, in solid lattices, such as elpasolites (a variety of Halide minerals with ABM2X3 stoichiometry). The magnetic properties of LnCl63− complexes (with pyridinium counter ions) were analysed in the non-trivial details of the causal role of the ligand field effects. In the same spirit, a detailed attention was devoted to the relatively simple lanthanide pentakis nitrato complexes, starting from the synthesis stage [...] continued into the instrumental and theoretical characterization. The Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of the pentakis nitrato ytterbate(III), Yb(NO3)52− [...] was recorded and modelled, the ligand field treatment being based also on advanced neutron spectroscopy measurements.A peculiar manifestation, discovered {{in the light of the}} developed methodologies, was the first report of level crossing in ligand field diagrams, tuned by external pressure.A systematic attention was devoted to the magnetism determined by lanthanide ions in solid compounds like the ternary oxides, CsLnO2 [...] or Cs2MLnX6 elpasolite type systems, with various combination of (M = Na, K, Rb) <b>alkaline</b> <b>metal</b> ions and (X=F, Cl, Br) halides, for several Ln(III) rare earth cases. Werner Urland proved the ligand field as the determinant for the pattern of magnetic susceptibility dependences on temperature, often mistakenly attributed to inter-center exchange coupling.A distinct branch of investigation concerned the unusual ferromagnetic Gd(III)-Gd(III) exchange coupling recorded in newly synthesized homo-polynuclear compexes of gadolinium with various carboxylates (acetate, fluoro- and chloro- substituted acetate) as bridging ligand.|$|E
