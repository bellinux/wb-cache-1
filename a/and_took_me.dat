2500|$|Dagmar left Copenhagen on 1 September 1866. Hans Christian Andersen, who had {{occasionally}} {{been invited}} to tell stories to Dagmar and her siblings when they were children, was among the crowd which flocked to the quay {{in order to see}} her off. The writer remarked in his diary, [...] "Yesterday, at the quay, while passing me by, she stopped <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> by the hand. My eyes were full of tears. What a poor child! Oh Lord, be kind and merciful to her! They say that there is a brilliant court in Saint Petersburg and the tsar's family is nice; still, she heads for an unfamiliar country, where people are different and religion is different and where she will have none of her former acquaintances by her side." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 1944, {{all of the}} Resistance governments {{agreed to}} accept the {{authority}} of the Free French government based in Algiers (until 1962 Algeria was considered to be part of France) and the Resistance was renamed FFI (Forces Françaises de l'Intérieur-Forces of the Interior). The Germans refused to accept the resistance as legitimate opponents and any résistant captured faced the prospect of torture and/or execution as the Germans maintained that the Hague and Geneva conventions did not apply to the resistance. By designating the resistance as part of the French armed forces was intended to provide the Resistance with legal protection and allow the French to threaten the Germans with the possibility of prosecution for war crimes. The designation did not help. For example, the résistante Sindermans was arrested in Paris on 24 February 1944 after she was found to be carrying forged papers. As she recalled: [...] "Immediately, they handcuffed me <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> to be interrogated. Getting no reply, they slapped in the face with such force that I fell from the chair. Then they whipped me with a rubber hose, full in the face. The interrogation began at 10 o'clock in the morning and ended at 11 o'clock that night. I must tell you I had been pregnant for three months".|$|E
