[...] When asked about her next album, she said she had been experimenting in her home studio with live musicians, stripping down her sound and playing the piano. Spears wanted the album to represent her Louisiana roots, explaining that she grew up listening to blues. [...] "When I was little, I would listen to myself [...] But the record label signs you, and you're just thankful to get a hit song. You can't really show off your voice <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> came from. I would like to try to have more influences of that sound. Not that I'm going to be like frickin' Tina Turner.
