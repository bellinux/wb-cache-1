5|$|A photon {{is a type}} of {{elementary}} particle, the quantum of the electromagnetic field including electromagnetic radiation such as light, and the force carrier for the electromagnetic force (even when static via virtual particles). The photon has zero rest mass and always moves <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light within a vacuum.|$|E
5|$|GRB970508 {{was also}} the first burst with an {{observed}} radio frequency afterglow. By analyzing the fluctuating strength of the radio signals, astronomer Dale Frail calculated that the source of the radio waves had expanded almost <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light. This provided strong evidence that GRBs are relativistically expanding explosions.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational waves, {{a direct}} {{consequence}} of Einstein's theory, are distortions of geometry that propagate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light, {{and can be}} thought of as ripples in spacetime. They should not be confused with the gravity waves of fluid dynamics, which are a different concept.|$|E

5|$|In modern quantum physics, the {{electromagnetic}} field {{is described by}} the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED). In this theory, light is described by the fundamental excitations (or quanta) of {{the electromagnetic}} field, called photons. In QED, photons are massless particles and thus, according to special relativity, they travel <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light in vacuum.|$|E
5|$|The loud bang that {{is heard}} is the super heated air around the {{lightning}} bolt expanding <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound. Because sound travels {{much more slowly}} than light the flash is seen before the bang, although both occur at the same moment.|$|E
5|$|During {{a central}} eclipse, the Moon's umbra (or antumbra, {{in the case}} of an annular eclipse) moves rapidly from west to east across the Earth. The Earth is also {{rotating}} from west to east, at about 28km/min at the Equator, but as the Moon is moving in the same direction as the Earth's spin at about 61km/min, the umbra almost always appears to move in a roughly west-east direction across a map of the Earth <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the Moon's orbital velocity minus the Earth's rotational velocity.|$|E

5|$|Pontecorvo's {{solution}} to the solar neutrino problem involved an idea that he had first considered in 1957, and developed over the following decade. This {{was the idea that}} neutrinos may convert into other types of neutrinos, a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation. Somewhere between the Sun and the Earth, electron neutrinos might transform into muon neutrinos. An important point was that for this to happen, neutrinos could not have zero mass, and therefore could not travel <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light. The existence of the oscillations was finally established by the Super-Kamiokande experiment in 1998 and later confirmed by other experiments.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} light has become {{important}} in high-frequency trading, where traders seek to gain minute advantages by delivering their trades to exchanges fractions of a second ahead of other traders. For example, traders have been switching to microwave communications between trading hubs, because of the advantage which microwaves travelling at near to the {{speed of light}} in air, have over fibre optic signals which travel 30–40% slower <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light through glass.|$|E
5|$|Faraday's and Ampère's work {{showed that}} a {{time-varying}} magnetic field acted {{as a source of}} an electric field, and a time-varying electric field was a source of a magnetic field. Thus, when either field is changing in time, then a field of the other is necessarily induced. Such a phenomenon has the properties of a wave, and is naturally referred to as an electromagnetic wave. Electromagnetic waves were analysed theoretically by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864. Maxwell developed a set of equations that could unambiguously describe the interrelationship between electric field, magnetic field, electric charge, and electric current. He could moreover prove that such a wave would necessarily travel <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light, and thus light itself was a form of electromagnetic radiation. Maxwell's Laws, which unify light, fields, and charge are one of the great milestones of theoretical physics.|$|E
40|$|ZnO {{thin film}} has been {{synthesized}} using sol-gel spin coating method and reflux mixing technique process. The surfuctances are Zinc acetat dehydrate Zn(CH 3 COOH) 2 2 H 2 O, etanaol and diethanolamine (DEA) consecutively used as based material, solvent, and stabilizer. The molar ratio between DEA and ZnAc were 1 : 1. The ZnO film was grown on a glass substrates using spin coating technique with <b>the</b> <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> consecutively 3000, 4000 and 5000 rpm, each for 30 seconds and calnination with pre-heating 300 oC and post-heating 5000 oC temperatures. The structural characterization results show the ZnO thin films are hexagonal and the smallest crystal size was 24. 9 nm <b>at</b> <b>the</b> spinning <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> 5000 rpm. <b>The</b> optical characterizations {{show that the}} highest transmission is 52. 6 % <b>at</b> <b>the</b> spinning <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> 3000 rpm and the highest absorption is 1. 277 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> spinning <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> 5000 rpm, and the smallest band gap of 3. 13 eV <b>at</b> <b>the</b> spinning <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> 5000 rpm...|$|R

5|$|The {{design of}} the command {{sequence}} to be relayed to the spacecraft and the calculations for each photograph's exposure time were developed by space scientists Candy Hansen of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Carolyn Porco of the University of Arizona. After the planned imaging sequence was taken on February 14, 1990, {{the data from the}} camera was stored initially in an on-board tape recorder. Transmission to Earth was also delayed by the Magellan and Galileo missions being given priority over the use of the Deep Space Network. Then, between March and May 1990, Voyager 1 returned 60 frames back to Earth, with the radio signal travelling <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light for nearly five and a half hours to cover the distance.|$|E
5|$|The minimum {{range of}} any radar system {{is due to}} its pulse width, {{the length of time}} that the {{transmitter}} is turned on before it turns off so the receiver can listen for reflections from targets. If the echo from the target is received while the transmitter is still sending, the echo will be swamped by the transmitted pulse backscattering off local sources. For instance, a radar with a pulse width of 1µs {{would not be able to}} see returns from a target less than 150m away, because the radar signal travelling <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light would cover the round trip distance of 300m before that 1µs interval had passed.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening scene}} is a three-minute computer-generated sequence, {{beginning}} {{with a view of}} Earth from high in the exosphere and listening in on numerous radio waves of modern programming emitting from the planet. The camera then starts zooming backward, passing the Moon, Mars, and other features of the solar system, then to the Oort cloud, interstellar space, the Local Bubble, the Milky Way, other galaxies of the Local Group, and eventually into deep space. As this occurs, the radio signals start to drop out and reflect older programming, representing the distance these signals would have traveled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light, eventually becoming silent as the distance becomes much greater. The sequence eventually resolves into the iris of young Ellie's eye as she is listening on her amateur radio set. This scale view shot of the entire universe was inspired by the short documentary film Powers of Ten (1977). At the time, it was the longest continuous computer-generated effect for a live-action film, eventually surpassed by the opening sequence from The Day After Tomorrow (2004).|$|E

5|$|Turbulence {{and dynamic}} {{forces in the}} {{heliosphere}} cannot affect {{the shape of the}} solar corona within, because the information can only travel <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> Alfvén waves. The solar wind travels outward continuously through the heliosphere, forming the solar magnetic field into a spiral shape, until it impacts the heliopause more than 50 AU from the Sun. In December 2004, the Voyager 1 probe passed through a shock front that is thought {{to be part of the}} heliopause. In late 2012 Voyager 1 recorded a marked increase in cosmic ray collisions and a sharp drop in lower energy particles from the solar wind, which suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause and entered the interstellar medium.|$|E

During its first year, the IEDC closed more transactions than similar efforts had during {{the previous two years}} combined. Between 2005 and 2008, 485 businesses committed to creating more than 60,000 new jobs and invest $14.5 billion into the Indiana economy. By the end of the administration, IEDC claimed to have closed on almost 1,500 deals to create a projected 169,000 new jobs since 2005.|$|E
