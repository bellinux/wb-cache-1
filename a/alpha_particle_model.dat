30|$|By taking {{advantage}} of the heavy ion transport models in PHITS, we have estimated neutron production by GCR protons and heavy components. Accurate calculation of the heavy ion reactions and transportation are important when estimating the neutron and gamma ray production from GCR. Although the amount of heavy nuclei (Z ≥ 2) in the GCR flux is small relative to that of protons, the neutron and gamma ray production rates by heavy ions are much larger than those by the protons. Therefore, neutron production from heavy ion reactions should be taken into account. The neutron production from <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> is of particular importance because <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> are more abundant than other heavy nuclei (Z > 2). The neutrons produced by the protons and <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> form the major part of the total neutron density profile produced by all the nuclides in the GCR. We have therefore focused on the production of neutrons from <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> in the GCR. To date, neutron production from <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> has been mainly estimated by scaling the calculation of protons (Dagge et al., 1991; Masarik and Reedy, 1996). The primary aim of our study was to compare, in detail, the estimation of neutron production from <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> by the proton scaling method with that by <b>alpha</b> <b>particle</b> interaction <b>model.</b>|$|R
30|$|Another {{interesting}} {{topic is}} how {{the difference in the}} scale factor is dependent on the GCR spectra. In Fig. 9 (a), the estimation using the scale factor of 3.77 is described. However, this scale factor does not seem to reproduce neutron production from <b>alpha</b> <b>particles.</b> The best fit to the calculations by the <b>alpha</b> <b>particle</b> interaction <b>models</b> is achieved with a scale factor of 2.94. This is in agreement with a scale factor of 3.0 that was previously estimated by Masarik and Reedy (1996) and Reedy (2009). Thus, we can safely state that variations in the scale factor are largely dependent on the GCR spectra, thereby demonstrating the need for more accurate data on the GCR spectra. On the other hand, {{it is not necessary to}} use a scale factor when using a heavy ion interaction model. Therefore, the use of the heavy ion interaction model in the radiation environment on the Moon will give more accurate results when calculating the neutron production in the lunar subsurface.|$|R
30|$|The neutron {{production}} from <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> in {{galactic cosmic rays}} (GCR) in the lunar subsurface has not been estimated with reliable precision despite its importance for lunar nuclear spectroscopy and space dosimetry. Here, we report our estimation of neutron {{production from}} GCR nuclei (protons and <b>alpha</b> <b>particles)</b> with the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System (PHITS), which includes several heavy ion interaction models. PHITS simulations of the equilibrium neutron density profiles in the lunar subsurface are compared with experimental data obtained in the Apollo 17 Lunar Neutron Probe Experiment. Our calculations successfully reproduced the data within an experimental error of 15 %. Our estimation of neutron production from GCR nuclei, estimated by scaling that from protons {{by a factor of}} 1.27, is in good agreement within an error of 1 % with the calculations using two different <b>alpha</b> <b>particle</b> interaction <b>models</b> in PHITS during a period of average activity of the solar cycle. However, we show that the factor depends on the incident GCR spectrum model used in the simulation. Therefore, we conclude that the use of heavy ion interaction models is important for estimating neutron production in the lunar subsurface.|$|R
30|$|In this work, {{we found}} that the best scale factor to {{estimate}} neutron production from GCR <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> impinging on the lunar surface was 3.77 ± 0.05 using the conventional GCR spectra given by Castagnoli and Lal (1980) and Lal (1985). No major difference was found between neutron production from <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> calculated using the proton scaling method and that calculated using the <b>alpha</b> <b>particle</b> interaction <b>models.</b> The main reason for this lack of difference is that the flux of <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> is relatively small so the difference in neutron production by <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> from that by protons is not a large contributory factor. However, the factor cannot be determined in advance, as it depends on the GCR spectra. Actually, when using the GCR spectra based on the latest observation data by BESS, the best scale factor was 2.94. This is almost in agreement with the estimation by Masarik and Reedy (1996) and Reedy (2009). Thus, the variation in the scale factor is largely dependent on the GCR spectra. This clearly shows the need for more accurate data on the GCR spectra. On the other hand, {{it is not necessary to}} use a scale factor when using a heavy ion interaction model. Therefore, we conclude that the use of heavy ion interaction models, such as JQMD and JAMQMD, are important for estimating neutron production from the interactions of GCR with the lunar subsurface.|$|R

A threshold energy of 17. 5 eV was used to model the damage by direct energy deposition, and a probability of 0. 13 was applied to model the induction of a single-strand break produced in DNA by OH radical reactions. For preliminary estimates, base damage was assumed to be induced by the same direct energy threshold deposition or by the reaction of an OH radical with the base, with a probability of 0. 8. Computational data are given on the complexity of damage, including base damage by electrons with energies of 100 - 4500 eV and ions with energies of 0. 3 - 4. 0 MeV/nucleon (59 - 9 keV microm(- 1) protons and 170 - 55 keV microm(- 1) <b>alpha</b> <b>particles).</b> Computational data are presented on the frequencies of single- and double-strand breaks induced {{as a function of the}} LET of the particles, and on the relative frequencies of complex single- and double-strand breaks for electrons. The modeling and calculations of strand breaks show that: (1) The yield of strand breaks per unit absorbed dose is nearly constant over a wide range of LET. (2) The majority of DNA damage is of a simple type, but the majority of the simple single-strand breaks are accompanied by at least one base damage. (3) For low-energy electrons, nearly 20 - 30 % of the double-strand breaks are of a complex type by virtue of additional breaks. The proportion of this locally clustered damage increases with LET, reaching about 70 % for the highest-LET <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> <b>modeled,</b> with the complexity of damage increasing further, to about 90 %, when base damage is considered. (4) The extent of damage in the local hit region of the DNA duplex is mostly limited to a length of a few base pairs.
