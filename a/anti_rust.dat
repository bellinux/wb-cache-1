For example, sodium phosphates are often used as emulsifiers (such as in processed cheese), thickening agents, and leavening agents for baked goods. They are also used to control pH of processed foods. They are also used in medicine for constipation and to prepare the bowel for medical procedures. Moreover, they are used in detergents for softening water, and as an efficient <b>anti</b> <b>rust</b> solution.|$|E
40|$|Glass Fiber Reinforced Concrete or (GFRC) is a {{composite}} that has glass fibers instead of steel strands for its reinforcement. Removing the steel reinforcement not only weakened, but also omitted steel erosion, corrosion, and their future repair costs, steel reinforcement costs, optimal coverage, and etc. In this research, several sources were studied to determine and clarify GFRCâ€™s applications in order to compare its featured properties with other fibers. Different figures and tables provided that show and compare physical and mechanical properties of GFRC and other fiber reinforcement. GFRC can be used wherever a light, strong, weather resistant, attractive, fire resistant, impermeable material is required. It has remarkable physical and mechanical assets. GFRC properties are dependent {{on the quality of}} materials and accuracy of production method. Despite its wide range applications in architecture the chief goal is to show and introduce important structural purposes, for instance: <b>anti</b> <b>rust</b> characteristics of GFRC made it a good replacement for water and sewer pipes and tanks, a thin protective layer of GFRC on concrete beams and columns can increase their durability in fire as well as low temperatures and generally it is a good replacement for susceptible materials in difficult environments...|$|E

Machining fluid (cutting oil, grinding fluid) {{that consists of}} oil, surface active agent, and extreme pressure agent, <b>anti</b> <b>rust</b> agent etc. is used. It improves machining performance, but it needs waste fluid disposal that is incineration or coagulative precipitation and so on. It causes huge cost and environmental load. Furthermore, it is afraid of workers health hazard for several chemicals while machining. Therefore, the electric rust preventive machining method system (water machining) is proposed and developed. This method uses only harmless water (tap water etc.) as machining fluid. In this paper, improvement of electric rust preventive chip sedimentation system {{that is part of}} water recycle system which is used for machining water purification and re-use. On long time (3 days) preservation of iron chip in water, decreasing of rust and turbidity is examined. Improved electric rust preventive chip sedimentation system is equipped simple circulation filter unit newly and its effectiveness is clarified. When many quantity of iron powder (3 kg) likened to actual sludge is sunken in sedimentation water tank, if electric rust prevention and simple circulation filter activated, turbidity and colour would be decreased greatly. Therefore, it is expected that purification load of next part of filters is decreased and life-time of filter and system will be prolonged...|$|E
