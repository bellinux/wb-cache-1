Many Mohave were skeptical of his reports, and reacted with disbelief.|$|E
500|$|... "Dance for You" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Beyoncé for the deluxe {{edition of}} her fourth studio album, 4 (2011). It was written by Beyoncé, Terius [...] "The-Dream" [...] Nash and Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart, while {{production}} was handled by the former two. [...] "Dance for You" [...] is a midtempo R and synthpop song, in which Beyoncé adopts sensual vocals. The instrumental elements used on it include echoing drum patterns and clapping synthesizers. In [...] "Dance for You", Beyoncé, as the female protagonist, speaks of the love she has for her man and <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> she will do to show him her appreciation.|$|E
500|$|Cisneros says of this moment: So to me {{it began}} there, and that's when I {{intentionally}} started writing <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> in my culture that were different from them—the poems that are these city voices—the first part of Wicked Wicked Ways—and the stories in House on Mango Street. I think it's ironic {{that at the moment}} when I was practically leaving an institution of learning, I began realizing in which ways institutions had failed me. Drawing on Mexican and Southwestern popular culture and conversations in the city streets, Cisneros wrote to convey the lives of people she identified with. Literary critic Jacqueline Doyle has described Cisneros's passion for hearing the personal stories that people tell and her commitment to expressing the voices of marginalized people through her work, such as the [...] "thousands of silent women" [...] whose struggles are portrayed in The House on Mango Street.|$|E

500|$|... "Silly Love Songs" [...] was {{met with}} {{critical}} acclaim from many television critics upon its initial airing. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave a very positive review of the episode, and wrote, [...] "This was our favorite type of Glee episode. Though we enjoy over-the-top spectacles , the show's real cleverness shines when they take songs from across the board and fit them into a cohesive storyline. Sue Sylvester didn't make an appearance and—dare we say it—we didn't even miss her." [...] Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle enjoyed the episode, going on to write, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} strong showing, if a little disjointed. Well, at least it was honest. If this show is one thing, it's disjointed. It's part of its spazzy appeal." [...] Melissa Maerz of the Los Angeles Times gave the episode a positive review: [...] "On Tuesday night, Glee wasn’t only back at its usual time, it was back to doing what it does best: giving us entertaining [...] storylines involving characters we care about who sing songs that emerge organically and advance the story. It was like a perfect heart-shaped bubble of an episode reminding the show’s fans <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> we’ve missed about the show these last couple of months." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{interlude}} {{was followed}} by a Cabaret-like performance of [...] "Hanky Panky", which started the Circus act. Next a jazz version of [...] "Deeper and Deeper" [...] was performed with her two female back-up dancers. Then followed [...] "Die Another Day", with Madonna and her dancers in a Tango-like choreography and backdrops displayed an old man in his deathbed. After that, she was strapped into an electric chair as she started singing [...] "Lament" [...] from the soundtrack of the film Evita and the platform rises with her to the top. Madonna commented later that [...] "Lament" [...] was her [...] "favorite part, [...] I like the idea of being restrained. I'm singing <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> I could have had, but my ego got in the way and I destroyed all my happiness." [...] The Orbital remix/video interlude of [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] was performed as dancers swung on trapezes. An acoustic-style segment started with [...] "Nothing Fails", with the guitar being played by Madonna herself. After that, she sang [...] "Don't Tell Me", recreating the choreography from the song's video with her dancers. The next song played was [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] where symbols of the 72 names of God were displayed on the backdrops. During the performance of the combined [...] "Mother and Father", Catholic images along with Madonna's Mother were displayed on the backdrops. Madonna then performed John Lennon's pro-peace song [...] "Imagine" [...] when photo montages of war-ravaged children, bombed-out villages and artillery were displayed in the backdrops. Asked why she chose to cover this song Madonna simply said: [...] "I wanted to make a statement with the ultimate peace song." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I can't stand brave men," [...] said Jane, [...] "it {{makes them}} so independent. I could only love {{a man who}} would depend on me in everything. Sometimes, when I have been {{roughing}} it out in the jungle," [...] she went on rather wistfully, [...] "I have had my dreams of some gentle clinging man who would put his hand in mine and tell me all his poor little troubles and let me pet and comfort him and bring the smiles back to his face. I'm beginning to want to settle down. After all there are other things for a woman to do in this life besides travelling and big-game hunting. I should like to go into Parliament. And, if I did that, I should practically have to marry. I mean, I should have to have a man to look after the social end of life and arrange parties and receptions and so on, and sit ornamentally at the head of my table. I can't imagine anything jollier than marriage under conditions like that. When I came back a bit done up after a long sitting at the House, he would mix me a whisky-and-soda and read poetry to me or prattle <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> he had been doing during the day....

6000|$|Surely {{everyone}} must love Randall. It {{had never occurred}} to Janet to ask herself, as Avery had asked, if she would like to marry Randall. Randall could never fancy her--a little plain, brown thing, only half grown. Nobody could think of her beside beautiful, rose-faced Avery. Janet accepted this fact unquestioningly. She had never been jealous. She only felt that she wanted Randall to have everything he wanted--to be perfectly happy. Why, it would be dreadful if he did not marry Avery--if he went and married some other girl. She would never see him then, never have any more delightful talks with him <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> they both loved so much--winds and delicate dawns, mysterious woods in moonlight and starry midnights, silver-white sails going out of the harbour in the magic of morning, and the grey of gulf storms. There would be nothing in life; it would just be one great, unbearable emptiness; for she, herself, would never marry. There was nobody for her to marry--and she didn't care. If she could have Randall for a real brother, she would not mind a bit being an old maid. And there was that beautiful new frame house Randall had built for his bride, which she, Janet, had helped him build, because Avery would not condescend to details of pantry and linen closet and cupboards. Janet and Randall had had such fun over the cupboards. No stranger must ever come to be mistress of that house. Randall must marry Avery, and she must love him. Could anything be done to make her love him? ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{parallel}} {{is still}} more clearly displayed {{in the case of}} the other sex. In the treatment of both mind and body, the decorative element has continued to predominate in a greater degree among women than among men. Originally, personal adornment occupied the attention of both sexes equally. In these latter days of civilisation, however, we see that in the dress of men the regard for appearance has in a considerable degree yielded to the regard for comfort; while in their education the useful has of late been trenching on the ornamental. In neither direction has this change gone so far with women. The wearing of earrings, finger-rings, bracelets; the elaborate dressings of the hair; the still occasional use of paint; the immense labour bestowed in making habiliments sufficiently attractive; and the great discomfort that will be submitted to for the sake of conformity; show how greatly, in the attiring of women, the desire of approbation overrides the desire for warmth and convenience. And similarly in their education, the immense preponderance of [...] "accomplishments" [...] proves how here, too, use is subordinated to display. Dancing, deportment, the piano, singing, drawing--what a large space do these occupy! If you ask why Italian and German are learnt, you will find that, under all the sham reasons given, the real reason is, that a knowledge of those tongues is thought ladylike. It is not that the books written in them may be utilised, which they scarcely ever are; but that Italian and German songs may be sung, and that the extent of attainment may bring whispered admiration. The births, deaths, and marriages of kings, and other like historic trivialities, are committed to memory, not because of any direct benefits that can possibly result from knowing them: but because society considers them parts of a good education--because the absence of such knowledge may bring the contempt of others. When we have named reading, writing, spelling, grammar, arithmetic, and sewing, we have named <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> a girl is taught with a view to their actual uses in life; and even some of these have more reference to the good opinion of others than to immediate personal welfare.|$|E
