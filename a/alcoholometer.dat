5000|$|An {{alcoholmeter}} is a hydrometer {{that indicates}} the alcoholic strength of liquids which are essentially {{a mixture of}} alcohol and water. It {{is also known as}} a proof and Tralles hydrometer (after Johann Georg Tralles, but commonly misspelled as traille and tralle). It measures the density of the fluid. Certain assumptions are made to estimate the amount of alcohol present in the fluid. <b>Alcoholometers</b> have scales marked with volume percents of [...] "potential alcohol", based on a pre-calculated specific gravity. A higher [...] "potential alcohol" [...] reading on this scale is caused by a greater specific gravity, assumed to be caused by the introduction of dissolved sugars. A reading is taken before and after fermentation and approximate alcohol content is determined by subtracting the post fermentation reading from the pre-fermentation reading.|$|R
50|$|Hydrometers are {{calibrated}} {{for different}} uses, {{such as a}} lactometer for measuring the density (creaminess) of milk, a saccharometer for measuring the density of sugar in a liquid, or an <b>alcoholometer</b> for measuring higher levels of alcohol in spirits.|$|E
