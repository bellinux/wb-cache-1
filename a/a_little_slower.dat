He finished the first heat of the 100 m sprint in third place with a time of 10.27, which was fast enough to qualify him for the quarterfinals. Collins ran <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>slower</b> in the second heat—finishing with a time of 10.34—which was not sufficient to qualify for the semifinals.|$|E

This {{was the first}} time that the Olympics had held a women's steeplechase competition and she greatly improved her record to 9:25.50 in the Olympic heats, but was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>slower</b> in the final and finished 13th overall.|$|E
25|$|Some clocks have a timing {{adjustment}} (a fast-slow control). When {{the owner}} compared his wall clock's {{time to the}} reference time, he noticed that his clock was too fast. Consequently, he could turn the timing adjust a small amount to make the clock run <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>slower</b> (frequency). If things work out right, his clock will be more accurate than before. Over a series of weekly adjustments, the wall clock's notion of a second would agree with the reference time (locked both in frequency and phase within the wall clock's stability).|$|E

He {{opened the}} batting {{on the first}} day, was 103 not out at lunch, and was fourth out not long after tea with the score at 343, on a day in which Wellington scored 494 for 9 wickets off 94 eight-ball overs. So {{he is likely to}} have scored at a little under a run a ball. His 204 a few weeks later was {{probably}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>slower,</b> but no less impressive: he came to the wicket at 18 for 1, reached his double-century in 262 minutes, and was last out in a team total of 374 off 85.1 overs.|$|E
25|$|After a fourth-place {{finish in}} the 200m at the 2004 US Olympic Trials, he was {{nominated}} as the substitute for the 4×100m relay at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Patton helped the American team ease through the heats, recording a time of 38.02seconds. He was substituted for the newly crowned 100m Olympic champion Justin Gatlin for the final race, but the move backfired for the team as they finished <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>slower</b> (38.08) and {{had to settle for}} the silver medal behind Great Britain – who they had easily beaten in the heats. Patton's 2005 and 2006 seasons were wrecked by significant groin and hip injuries and he only returned to major competitions in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Chmelková was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>slower</b> in the 1967 season, {{but still}} {{ranked in the}} top twenty at 54.4 seconds. She failed to defend her {{national}} title in 1967, with European indoor medalist Libuše Macounová taking the honour. She ran in the 400m heats at the 1967 European Indoor Games, but was disqualified. The following year she was back on top nationally, improving her championship record to 54.1 seconds (a mark that lasted six years until Cerchlanová bettered it). She earned her a place on the team for Czechoslovakia at the 1968 Summer Olympics. However, she did not travel well to the Mexico City Olympic Games and was eliminated in the first round with a run of 54.9 seconds. She won her fourth and final national title in 1969 with a time of 54.7 seconds.|$|E

25|$|People don't {{understand}} {{how difficult it}} is living with a head injury. It's really hard; it sucks; it's aggravating. It feels like I'm a little off on things, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>slower.</b> My left side is always numb, and my brain doesn't feel as sharp as it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad. It's like you're forgotten when you're out of the limelight. Nobody owes me anything, but somebody could maybe give me something (work-wise) to keep me involved. I used to make $5,000 for a two-hour appearance. Now, I have a hard time finding a job for anything. I hate to say it, but sometimes I wish God had just taken me.|$|E

He won the Carlsbad 5000 for a second year running in March 2012. Two 5000m wins on the 2012 IAAF Diamond League circuit, including a personal best of 12:46.81 minutes, making him the fifth fastest ever over the distance and earning him selection for the 2012 Summer Olympics. At the Olympics in London, he was the fastest qualifier in winning his heat. In the final he chased Mo Farah over the final lap, but did not managed to catch the Briton and took the silver medal behind him. He ended the year with a fourth-place finish at the Weltklasse Zurich, finishing second in the Diamond League rankings after Isaiah Kiplangat Koech.|$|E
25|$|Expanding her oeuvre, in 2010 Russell {{placed in}} the top three at the Jamaican High School in the 100 metres hurdles as well as her long jump speciality. Taking in {{combined}} track and field events, she entered the pentathlon at the 2010 CARIFTA Games and won by a margin of nearly 400 points. She still entered the long jump individually, and placed fourth. The Jamaican junior championships saw her win a long jump/400 metres sprint double. International junior medals followed at the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships, where the 16-year-old Russell took the 400m silver medal win a personal best of 53.68 seconds and helped the Jamaican 4×400 metres relay team to the gold medals. She was selected for the same events at the 2010 World Junior Championships in Athletics. Although she was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>slower</b> in the 400m individual event, being eliminated in the semi-finals, she won a medal with the Jamaican team, which ran its fastest time of the year (3:32.24 minutes) to claim the bronze medals.

500|$|The book did, however, receive {{consistent}} criticism.

[...] – and the difficulty in entering the series without reading all the previous books first: VOYA simply says [...] "readers attempting to enter the series through this volume are likely to be quickly lost."

However, Barnes experimented with bowling <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>slower</b> and cutting the ball, and developed both an off cutter and a leg cutter that he concluded were far more effective than swinging the ball. Despite his bowling talent, Barnes did not play any Test cricket between July 1902 and December 1907, as he was considered a [...] "prima donna" [...] who would only put in the effort when he was in the right mood, and being suitably paid.
