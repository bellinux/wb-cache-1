An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism. According to Xu (2010), Sinoceratops can be distinguished based on the following diagnostic characteristics: {{there are at least}} ten robust, strongly curved hornlike processes along the rear margin of the combined parietals, {{while at the same time}} at least four hornlike processes on the combined squamosals are present; there is a large accessory fenestra in front of the antorbital fenestra (differing from <b>all</b> <b>other</b> known centrosaurines); the external margin of the parietals is only weakly undulating (differing from <b>all</b> <b>other</b> known centrosaurines); and the presence of broad-based epoccipitals (differing from <b>all</b> <b>other</b> known centrosaurines).|$|E
