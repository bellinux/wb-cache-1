5|$|A {{critical}} {{issue is how}} to design protected areas for <b>amphibians</b> which will provide suitable conditions for their survival. Conservation efforts {{through the use of}} protected areas have shown to generally be a temporary solution to population decline and extinction because the <b>amphibians</b> become inbred. It is crucial for most <b>amphibians</b> to maintain a high level of genetic variation through large and more diverse environments.|$|E
5|$|After the Carboniferous {{rainforest}} collapse amphibian dominance {{gave way}} to reptiles, and <b>amphibians</b> were further devastated by the Permian–Triassic extinction event. During the Triassic Period (250 to 200 million years ago), the reptiles continued to out-compete the <b>amphibians,</b> leading {{to a reduction in}} both the amphibians' size and their importance in the biosphere. According to the fossil record, Lissamphibia, which includes all modern <b>amphibians</b> and is the only surviving lineage, may have branched off from the extinct groups Temnospondyli and Lepospondyli at some period between the Late Carboniferous and the Early Triassic. The relative scarcity of fossil evidence precludes precise dating, but the most recent molecular study, based on multilocus sequence typing, suggests a Late Carboniferous/Early Permian origin for extant <b>amphibians.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Amphibians</b> are ectothermic, {{tetrapod}} vertebrates of {{the class}} Amphibia. Modern <b>amphibians</b> are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit {{a wide variety of}} habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus <b>amphibians</b> typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. <b>Amphibians</b> use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, <b>amphibians</b> are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.|$|E

5|$|Experts {{disagree}} {{over whether}} temnospondyls were ancestral to modern <b>amphibians</b> (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians), {{or whether the}} whole group died out without leaving any descendants. Different hypotheses have placed modern <b>amphibians</b> as the descendants of temnospondyls, another group of early tetrapods called lepospondyls, or even as descendants of both groups (with caecilians evolving from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolving from temnospondyls). Recent studies place a family of temnospondyls called the amphibamids as the closest relatives of modern <b>amphibians.</b> Similarities in teeth, skulls, and hearing structures link the two groups.|$|E
40|$|<b>Amphibian</b> {{populations are}} declining {{globally}} (Jennings and Hayes 1985, Beebee et al. 1990, Blaustein and Wake 1990).

However, {{the relative importance of}} each potential factor is often unknown in specific cases. Because the processes that underlie <b>amphibian</b> declines are not well understood, collaborative efforts, such as the North American <b>Amphibian</b> Monitoring Program (NAAMP), have been developed to collect basic ecological data, and to systematically monitor <b>amphibian</b> population trends.

40|$|More {{than five}} {{thousand}} genes annotated in the recently published Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis genomes {{do not have}} a candidate orthologous counterpart in other vertebrate species. To determine whether these sequences represent genuine amphibian-specific genes or annotation errors, it is necessary to analyze them alongside sequences from other <b>amphibian</b> species. However, due to large genome sizes and an abundance of repeat sequences, there are limited numbers of gene sequences available from <b>amphibian</b> species other than Xenopus. AmphiBase is a new genomic resource covering non-model <b>amphibian</b> species, based on public domain transcriptome data and computational methods developed during the X. laevis genome project.

5|$|Habitat {{modification}} or {{destruction is}} one of the most dramatic issues affecting amphibian species worldwide. As <b>amphibians</b> generally need aquatic and terrestrial habitats to survive, threats to either habitat can affect populations. Hence, <b>amphibians</b> may be more vulnerable to habitat modification than organisms that only require one habitat type. Large scale climate changes may further be modifying aquatic habitats, preventing <b>amphibians</b> from spawning altogether.|$|E
5|$|There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} for extinction of <b>amphibians</b> at the K–Pg boundary. A study of fossil vertebrates across the K–Pg boundary in Montana concluded that no species of amphibian became extinct. Yet {{there are several}} species of Maastrichtian amphibian, not included {{as part of this}} study, which are unknown from the Paleocene. These include the frog Theatonius lancensis and the albanerpetontid Albanerpeton galaktion; therefore, some <b>amphibians</b> do seem to have become extinct at the boundary. The relatively low levels of extinction seen among <b>amphibians</b> probably reflect the low extinction rates seen in freshwater animals.|$|E
5|$|This {{impacted}} <b>amphibians</b> {{in particular}} {{in a number of}} ways. The enormous drop in sealevel due to greater quantities of the world's water being locked into glaciers profoundly affected the distribution and size of the semiaquatic ecosystems which <b>amphibians</b> favored, and the significant cooling of the climate further narrowed the amount of new territory favorable to <b>amphibians.</b> Given that among the hallmarks of <b>amphibians</b> are an obligatory return to a body of water to lay eggs, a delicate skin prone to desiccation (thereby often requiring the amphibian to be relatively close to water throughout its life), and a reputation of being a bellwether species for disrupted ecosystems due to the resulting low resilience to ecological change, <b>amphibians</b> were particularly devastated, with the Labyrinthodonts among the groups faring worst. In contrast, reptiles - whose amniotic eggs have a membrane that enables gas exchange out of water, and which thereby can be laid on land - were better adapted to the new conditions. Reptiles invaded new niches at a faster rate and began diversifying their diets, becoming herbivorous and carnivorous, rather than feeding exclusively on insects and fish. Meanwhile, the severely impacted <b>amphibians</b> simply could not out-compete reptiles in mastering the new ecological niches, and so were obligated to pass the tetrapod evolutionary torch to the increasingly successful and swiftly radiating reptiles.|$|E

40|$|By {{comparing}} {{the range of}} emission frequencies with that of neural characteristic frequencies of the <b>amphibian</b> and basilar papillae, the emission generation site may be inferred. Spontaneous otoacoustic emissions in the <b>amphibian</b> car seem to originate from the <b>amphibian</b> papilla. In contrast, distortion product otoacoustic emission are presumably generated by both the <b>amphibian</b> and the basilar papillae. Distortion products from the <b>amphibian</b> papilla {{are very sensitive to}} ischemia; distortion products from the basilar papilla are less sensitive. These results suggest that the basilar papilla may not include an active amplifier. In support of this hypothesis, we show that distortion products from the basilar papilla show only a weak temperature dependence. These emissions are possibly independent of metabolic rate. The basilar papilla in frogs may be the only passive vertebrate hearing organ. In contrast, emissions from the <b>amphibian</b> papilla are clearly temperature dependent, consistent with active auditory processing...|$|R
5|$|Two life-history {{features}} of <b>amphibians</b> are {{often cited as}} a reason why <b>amphibians</b> are good indicators of environmental health or 'canaries in the coal mine'. Like all <b>amphibians,</b> the long-toed salamander has both an aquatic and terrestrial life transition and semipermeable skin. Since they serve different ecological functions in the water {{than they do in}} land, the loss of one amphibian species is equivalent to the loss of two ecological species. The second notion is that <b>amphibians,</b> such as long-toed salamanders, are more susceptible to the absorption of pollutants because they naturally absorb water and oxygen through their skin. The validity of this special sensitivity to environmental pollutants, however, has been called into question. The problem is more complex, because not all <b>amphibians</b> are equally susceptible to environmental damage because there is such a diverse array of life histories among species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amphibians</b> are ectothermic (cold-blooded) {{vertebrates}} that do {{not maintain}} their body temperature through internal physiological processes. Their metabolic rate is low and as a result, their food and energy requirements are limited. In the adult state, they have tear ducts and movable eyelids, and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations. They have muscular tongues, which in many species can be protruded. Modern <b>amphibians</b> have fully ossified vertebrae with articular processes. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, apart from a few fish-like scales in certain caecilians. The skin contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands (a type of granular gland). The hearts of <b>amphibians</b> have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle. They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea. Most <b>amphibians</b> lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults. <b>Amphibians</b> breathe {{by means of a}} pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat. They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amphibians</b> usually swallow food whole but may chew {{it lightly}} first to subdue it. They {{typically}} have small hinged pedicellate teeth, a feature unique to <b>amphibians.</b> The base and crown {{of these are}} composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals. Salamanders, caecilians and some frogs {{have one or two}} rows of teeth in both jaws, but some frogs (Rana spp.) lack teeth in the lower jaw, and toads (Bufo spp.) have no teeth. In many <b>amphibians</b> there are also vomerine teeth attached to a facial bone in the roof of the mouth.|$|E
40|$|Non-native fish often {{negatively}} affect <b>amphibian</b> populations. The sunbleak (Leucaspius delineatus), a small cyprinid fish, is often released into ponds that support <b>amphibian</b> populations {{because it is}} thought not to consume <b>amphibian</b> larvae; the argument was based on diet analyses. Here, we present results from a laboratory experiment that demonstrates that sunbleak consume <b>amphibian</b> eggs and larvae. Mortality of eggs and small tadpoles was 100 %. Thus, sunbleak at least potentially could be harmful to <b>amphibian</b> populations despite their preference for small prey items reported in the literature. Although diet analyses are valuable, the assessment of whether a species is a predator of another should not be based solely on diet analyses. Experimental predation trials are necessary to assess predation risk...|$|R
