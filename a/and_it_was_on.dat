However, they decided to separate in 1988, and were divorced two years later; Horton later blamed the split on their devotion to their work rather than on their marriage.|$|E

5|$|Although List {{wanted to}} become an artist and scholar, he reluctantly agreed to his father's insistence that he enter the family's leather goods business. During his leisure time he devoted himself to writing and {{sketching}} as well as rambling, riding, or rowing in the countryside, becoming both {{a member of the}} Viennese rowing club Donauhort and the secretary of the Austrian Alpine Association (Österreichischer Alpenverein). He was involved in both solitary and group expeditions into the Austrian Alps, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> one of the latter journeys that he left his mountaineering group to spend Midsummer night alone atop the Geiselberg hillfort. On 24 June 1875 he and four friends rowed down the Danube before camping for the night {{at the site of the}} ancient Roman fortification of Carnuntum to commemorate the 1500th anniversary of the Battle of Carnuntum, in which Germanic tribes defeated the Roman Army. List later claimed that while his friends caroused, he celebrated the event with a fire and by burying eight bottles of wine in the shape of a swastika beneath the arch of the monument's Pagan Gate.|$|E
5|$|In the Metamorphoses by Antoninus Liberalis, written {{somewhere in}} the 2nd or 3rd century A.D., the myth is set in Phoenicia, near Mount Lebanon. Here King Thias, son of Belus and Orithyia, had a {{daughter}} named Smyrna. Being of great beauty, she was sought by men from far and wide. She had devised many tricks in order to delay her parents and defer the day they would choose a husband for her. Smyrna had been driven mad by desire for her father {{and did not want}} anybody else. At first she hid her desires, eventually telling her nurse, Hippolyte, the secret of her true feelings. Hippolyte told the king that a girl of exalted parentage wanted to lie with him, but in secret. The affair lasted {{for an extended period of}} time, and Smyrna became pregnant. At this point, Thias desired to know who she was so he hid a light, illuminating the room and discovering Smyrna's identity when she entered. In shock, Smyrna gave birth prematurely to her child. She then raised her hands and said a prayer, which was heard by Zeus who took pity on her and turned her into a tree. Thias killed himself, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the wish of Zeus that the child was brought up and named Adonis.|$|E

5|$|Until 1926, Shamrock Rovers wore {{green and}} white striped jerseys but {{following}} a suggestion by a committee member, John Sheridan, the club chose to adopt the {{green and white}} hooped strip. A close relationship existed between the club and Belfast Celtic <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> account of this that the idea was formed. The first game featuring the new jerseys was against Bray Unknowns in a FAI Cup match on 9 January 1927 at Shelbourne Park. The Hoops lost the game 3–0 and {{senior members of the}} club considered abandoning the new strip. Despite this loss, the team continued to wear green and white hoops and have done ever since. The 2007 season was the first season since the hoops were introduced that they were not continuous around {{the main body of the}} jersey. The style of the shirt sleeves has been changed on numerous occasions. The away colours of the club have varied over time. In the early 1980s, the club had a yellow away jersey. In the mid-1990s, a hooped purple jersey was adopted. In 2011, the team wore an all black away strip.|$|E

The township of Lake View saw a significant growth in population from 2,000 in 1870 to 45,000 in 1887. Under the weight of public service demands, the township of Lake View was annexed to Chicago in 1889.

25|$|On occasion, the PBY's were {{pressed into}} service as bombers; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> such a mission that Waterman was killed.

The Catalina flying boats were slated to hit Japanese shipping reportedly in the harbor at the island of Jolo, in the Sulu Archipelago.

25|$|Following this, {{the army}} was reassigned back to Bryansk Front. Renewing the offensive, Boldin's forces made two secret re-groupings before {{striking}} the weak left flank of the German position south of Kirov on Sept. 8, unhinging their line and forcing them to abandon Bryansk on the 17th. In Soviet accounts it is Gen. M.M. Popov, the Front commander, who gets most {{of the credit for}} this success. By Sept. 27, 50th Army had seized a bridgehead across the Sozh River, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> this date that Popov met at the Kremlin with Stalin, Deputy Chief of the General Staff A.I. Antonov, and Gen. K.K. Rokossovsky, commander of Belorussian Front (later renamed 1st Belorussian Front). As a result of this meeting 50th Army was handed over to the latter Front {{in the first week of}} October.|$|E
25|$|G-ADDR, {{the fifth}} Scion II, was {{retained}} by Shorts as an experimental testbed aircraft, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> this aircraft (temporarily designated M.3) that a scale wooden {{model of the}} slender wings (with Gouge flaps) for the later Empire boats was tested, the first flight in this configuration being conducted by Lankester Parker on 6 August 1935. With these flaps fitted it was tested at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, which found that the Gouge flap decreased distance to take-off and stalling speed, among other improvements. Further work with standard wings was carried out; one flight from Rochester Airport, with experimental full-span flaps incorporating retractable spoilers instead of ailerons, was made on 22 July 1936; this idea proved unworkable, Lankester Parker having to draw on his considerable experience to coax the aircraft around on a single circuit before landing safely. The standard wing was refitted and the aircraft continued with Shorts in this configuration until it was impressed into military service in 1940, an operational usage experienced by 14 of the 22 Scion/Scion II aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in Grand Valley {{with the}} promise of the railway, the town began to boom. Regular voyages were made by steam sternwheelers to the city, each {{bringing}} more and more settlers. In the spring of 1881, General Thomas L. Rosser, Chief Engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway arrived in Grand Valley. It was Rosser's job to choose the townsites for the railway. Rosser approached Dougald McVicar of Grand Valley and offered him $25,000 for the railway in Grand Valley. McVicar countered with $50,000 to which Rosser replied that “I’ll be damned if a town of any kind is ever built here". So instead Rosser crossed the Assiniboine river and built the site of the railway on the high sandy south of the River, two miles west of Grand Valley. So the site was then moved to a site just west of today's current First Street bridge in Brandon. A shanty had been built there by a man named J.D. Adamson, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> this quarter section Adamson claimed that Rosser chose as the townsite for the CPR Railway and named Brandon.|$|E
