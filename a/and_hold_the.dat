5|$|At 15:30 on 21 August the Battle for Hill 60 began. Charging {{straight}} at the hill, the regiment suffered sixty per cent casualties, among them Hutton in command. He was replaced by Major Hurst, from the 1st Squadron, and they succeeded in capturing the Turkish trench within fifteen minutes of going over the top. But {{on either side of}} them the rest of the attack had failed, leaving the regiment and the Otago Mounted Rifles isolated {{from the rest of the}} force. Not having the manpower to continue the assault, they were ordered to dig in <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> position. They held on until 23 August when they were relieved by the Auckland and Wellington Mounted Rifles.|$|E

5|$|Both {{airborne}} divisions began {{landing at}} the same time, 10:00 on 24 March 1945. The 6th Airborne were to protect {{the northern part of}} the landing area; they had six drop zones around the town of Hamminkeln. The plan was for them to secure the town, the high ground east of the village of Bergen, and bridges across the river IJssel. The 5th Parachute Brigade would land on the northernmost DZ, DZ-B, <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> area east of the Wesel railway line.|$|E
5|$|In the 1770s, cannon {{operation}} {{worked as}} follows: each cannon would be manned by two gunners, six soldiers, and four officers of artillery. The right gunner was to prime the piece and load it with powder, {{and the left}} gunner would fetch the powder from the magazine {{and be ready to}} fire the cannon at the officer's command. On each side of the cannon, three soldiers stood, to ram and sponge the cannon, <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> ladle. The second soldier on the left tasked with providing 50 bullets.|$|E
5|$|Johnson left Washington, D.C. {{just before}} Congress adjourned. He raised one {{thousand}} men, nominally {{part of the}} militia brigade under Kentucky Governor Isaac Shelby, but largely operating independently. He disciplined his men, required that every man have arms in prime condition and ready to hand, and hired gunsmiths, blacksmiths, and doctors at his own expense. He devised a new tactical system: when any group of men encountered the enemy, they were to dismount, take cover, <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> enemy in place. All groups not in contact were to ride {{to the sound of}} firing, and dismount, surrounding the enemy when they got there. Between May and September, Johnson raided throughout the Northwest, burning the war supply centers of Indian villages, surrounding Indian fighting units and scattering them, killing some Indian warriors each time.|$|E

5|$|Justice Stevens wrote a brief {{dissenting opinion}} {{arguing that the}} case should have been {{dismissed}} because the Illinois legislature has largely reduced penalties for marijuana possession, which made it ridiculous for the officers to rush to get a warrant. He said {{that even if he}} reached the merits of the question, he would affirm <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> search unconstitutional because the majority misapplied a balancing of “privacy-related and law enforcement-related concerns". He wanted to give broader protection to the idea of the home as a place for protection, even if the home in this case was a trailer.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Pedrarias {{travelled}} to Nicaragua from Panama, executed Hernández de Córdoba, {{and took}} direct {{control of the}} province. He claimed Honduras for himself and sent several expeditions into the Olancho Valley. Saavedra demanded that Pedrarias withdraw, and received conciliatory messages in return. Pedrarias then launched a surprise attack against Cortes' supporters, capturing {{a number of them}} in Olancho, then marching north with the intention of launching an attack upon Puerto de Caballos. Saavedra received news of the northward assault and dispatched a larger force to counter Pedrarias' captains. After negotiations, both forces agreed to retreat. In the event, Pedrarias' force reneged on the agreement and split into two. One portion continued its march towards Puerto de Caballos while the other returned to Olancho to found a settlement <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> valley for Pedrarias.|$|E
5|$|Plans for the Normandy {{invasion}} included five assault landings {{from the}} sea, supported by airborne landings on both flanks by British and American airborne divisions. In {{what would be}} its first action, the 6th Airborne Division was chosen {{to land on the}} left flank of the British landing zone. Its primary objective on day one was to capture intact two bridges over the Caen canal and the River Orne. The division's secondary objective was the destruction of the Merville gun battery, which could engage ships landing nearby at Sword. To prevent German reinforcements approaching the invasion area from the east, 6th Airborne also had to destroy the bridges crossing the River Dives then dig in around Ranville <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> left flank of the advance.|$|E

5|$|The first British {{airborne}} landing was Operation Ladbroke, {{which was}} carried out by the 1st Airlanding Brigade, under Brigadier Philip Hicks, during the night of 9–10 July.

The second British airborne mission, Operation Glutton, was to have been undertaken by the 2nd Parachute Brigade, under Brigadier Ernest Down, on the night of 10–11 July, aiming to capture a bridge beside Augusta. However circumstances changed and the second operation was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal Football Club is an English {{professional}} association football club based in Holloway, London. The club {{was formed in}} Woolwich in 1886 as Dial Square before being renamed as Royal Arsenal, and then Woolwich Arsenal in 1893. In 1914, the club's name was shortened to Arsenal F.C. after moving to Highbury a year earlier. After spending their first four seasons solely participating in cup tournaments and friendlies, Arsenal became the first southern member admitted into the Football League in 1893. In spite of finishing fifth in the Second Division in 1919, the club was voted to rejoin the First Division {{at the expense of}} local rivals Tottenham Hotspur. Since that time, they have not fallen below the first tier of the English football league system <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> record for the longest uninterrupted period in the top flight.

5|$|As {{early as}} 1907, U.S. naval and {{military}} planners {{had concluded that}} it would be impractical to repel an invasion of the Philippines. The best that could be hoped for was that the garrison could hold out on the Bataan peninsula until help arrived. In the 1920s it was estimated that they could do so for about 60 days. By the 1930s, the planners had become decidedly pessimistic in view of the increased capability of aircraft, and by 1936 they were agreed that the Philippine should be written off. But in July 1941, this decision was abruptly reversed, and it became the policy of the U.S. government to defend <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> Philippines. This was based, at least in part, in the belief that Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers could deter or defeat an invading force.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{late in the}} war, the {{battalion}} received orders to deploy overseas again. Boarding the Duntroon on 24 November 1944, a week later {{the battalion}} arrived at Aitape in New Guinea. There, the 6th Division took over from the American garrison in order to free up the US troops for further fighting in the Philippines. Following disembarkation, the 2/5th concentrated around Tadji airstrip. In December, the Australians began offensive operations against the Japanese forces that were operating in the surrounding areas. For the next seven months until the war ended the 2/5th undertook patrols through the Torricelli and Prince Alexander mountain ranges, as the 17th Brigade worked to initially establish <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> Australian base around Aitape, before moving inland towards Maprik {{and then on to}} Kiarivu to pursue the Japanese forces that had withdrawn into the interior. Although only intended as a mopping up campaign, it was an arduous and costly period. Consisting primarily of small unit actions which resulted in disproportionately heavy casualties for the Australians, throughout the course of the campaign the 2/5th suffered 146 casualties, including eight officers killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|Jourdan's {{orders were}} to take the army into Germany and secure {{strategic}} positions, particularly on the roads through Stockach and Schaffhausen, at the western-most border of Lake Constance.

These positions would prevent the Allies of the Second Coalition from moving troops {{back and forth between}} the northern Italian and German theaters, and insure French access to these strategic passes. Ultimately, this positioning would allow the French to control all western roads leading to and from Vienna. Finally, to complete Vienna's isolation, the army of Mayence would sweep through the north, blocking further access to and from Vienna from any of the northern Provinces, or from Britain.|$|E
