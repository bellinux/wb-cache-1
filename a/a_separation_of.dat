5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387 was a {{gravitational}} microlensing event {{detected by}} the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics collaboration on July 24, 2009, which searches and documents chance and brief alignments of stars with other stars or objects; such alignments cause a gravitational lens effect, which bends light and causes distorted, but magnified, images {{that can be}} interpreted. The detection of two caustics were logged {{over the next few}} days by the South African Astronomical Observatory, the Perth Observatory, and the Canopus Hill Observatory in Tasmania, with <b>a</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> about seven days between caustic events.|$|E
5|$|Capella A {{consists}} of two yellow evolved stars that have been calculated to orbit each other every 104 days with <b>a</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> around 100 million km. The pair is a non-eclipsing binary—that is, as seen from Earth, neither star passes {{in front of the}} other. The orbit is known extremely accurately and can be used to derive an orbital parallax with far better precision than the one measured directly. The stars are not near enough to each other for the Roche lobe of either star to have been filled and any significant mass transfer to have taken place, even during the red giant stage of the primary star.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to a close companion of unknown type at <b>an</b> angular <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> 0.17 arc seconds, the primary shares an orbit with a binary star system, components B and C, that lie at <b>an</b> angular <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> 17.8 arc seconds. At the estimated distance of this system, this corresponds to <b>a</b> projected <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> around 1,150 AU. The B/C pair consist of visual magnitude 10.5 and 10.8 stars with <b>a</b> mean <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> 0.3 arc seconds. They have estimated mass of 90% and 95% that of the Sun, respectively.|$|R
50|$|Iota1 Scorpii has a 10th {{magnitude}} companion at <b>an</b> angular <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> 37.5 arcseconds, which, at {{the distance}} of this star, gives it <b>a</b> projected <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> 20,000 Astronomical Units (AU). <b>As</b> the relative <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> the two stars {{along the line of}} sight to the Earth is not known, however, this distance represents only a minimum value for their separation.|$|R
50|$|The {{secondary}} component, 84 Ceti B, has {{a classification}} of K2V, {{making it a}} K-type main sequence star. It lies at <b>an</b> angular <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> 3.3″ from the primary, which is equivalent to <b>a</b> physical <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> at least 74.5 AU.|$|R
5|$|Consisting of two quasars with <b>a</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> {{less than}} 5 arcseconds, the quasar pair 4C 11.50 {{is one of}} the {{visually}} closest pairs of quasars in the sky. The two have markedly different redshifts, however, and are thus unrelated. The foreground member of the pair (4C 11.50 A) does not have enough mass to refract light from the background component (4C 11.50 B) enough to produce a lensed image, although it does have a true companion of its own. An even stranger galaxy pair is 3C 321. Unlike the previous pair, the two galaxies making up 3C 321 are interacting with each other and {{are in the process of}} merging. Both members appear to be active galaxies; the primary radio galaxy may be responsible for the activity in the secondary by means of the former's jet driving material onto the latter's supermassive black hole.|$|E
5|$|Located about 1.8° west of Epsilon (ε) Tauri is T Tauri, the {{prototype}} of a class of variable stars called T Tauri stars. This star undergoes erratic changes in luminosity, varying between magnitude 9 to 13 {{over a period of}} weeks or months. This is a newly formed stellar object that is just emerging from its envelope of gas and dust, but has not yet become a main sequence star. The surrounding reflection nebula NGC 1555 is illuminated by T Tauri, and thus is also variable in luminosity. To the north lies Kappa Tauri, a visual double star consisting of two A7-type components. The pair have <b>a</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> just 5.6 arc minutes, making them a challenge to split with the naked eye.|$|E
5|$|Standard Oil {{moved its}} {{headquarters}} to New York City at 26 Broadway, and Rockefeller became {{a central figure}} in the city's business community. He bought a residence in 1884 on 54th Street near the mansions of other magnates such as William Henry Vanderbilt. Despite personal threats and constant pleas for charity, Rockefeller took the new elevated train to his downtown office daily. In 1887, Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission which was tasked with enforcing equal rates for all railroad freight, but by then Standard depended more on pipeline transport. More threatening to Standard's power was the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, originally used to control unions, but later central to {{the breakup of the}} Standard Oil trust. Ohio was especially vigorous in applying its state anti-trust laws, and finally forced <b>a</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> Standard Oil of Ohio {{from the rest of the}} company in 1892, the first step in the dissolution of the trust.|$|E

5|$|Both Björn Kurtén and Camille Arambourg {{promoted}} an Asiatic origin for the species; Kurtén focussed {{his arguments}} on the Plio-Pleistocene taxon Crocuta sivalensis from the Siwaliks, a view defended by Arambourg, who nonetheless allowed {{the possibility of}} an Indo-Ethiopian origin. This stance was contested by Ficarelli and Torre, who referred to evidence of the spotted hyena's presence from African deposists dating from the early Pleistocene, a similar age to the Asian C. sivalensis. Studies on the phylogeographic distribution of mtDNA haplotypes indicates three migration events from Africa to Eurasia, though neither the topology of the phylogenetic tree or the fossil record exclude {{the possibility of an}} Asian origin. The earliest migration of spotted hyenas from Africa to Eurasia began less than 3.5 million years ago, most probably from the area where the first spotted hyena fossils were discovered, reaching East Asia and most likely also Pakistan. The second migration of spotted hyenas occurred less than 1.3–1.5 million years ago and resulted in the first arrival of hyenas in Europe and <b>a</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> African spotted hyenas into a southern and a northern population. The third spotted hyena migration took place 0.36 million years ago, starting from the northern African population and reaching both Europe and Asia. Unlike other African carnivores, {{with the exception of the}} leopard, there is no evidence to suggest that spotted hyenas underwent a genetic bottleneck during the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|Circinus is a faint constellation, {{with only}} one star {{brighter}} than fourth magnitude. Alpha Circini, a white main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 3.19, is 54light-years away and 4° south of Alpha Centauri. Not only {{the brightest star in}} the constellation, it is also the brightest example of a rapidly oscillating Ap (RoAp) star in the night sky. It has the unusual spectral type A7Vp SrCrE, showing increased emissions of strontium, chromium and europium. Stars of this type have oddly localised magnetic fields and are slightly variable. Alpha Circini forms a binary star system with an orange dwarf companion of spectral type K5 and magnitude 8.5, which with <b>a</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> 5.7arcseconds is only discernible with a telescope. The distance between the two stars is 260AU and they take 2600years to rotate around a common centre of gravity. The second brightest star is Beta Circini, a white main sequence star of spectral type A3Va and a magnitude of 4.07, about 100light-years away. It has around 1.8times the diameter of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|In a 1976 referendum, New Jersey voters {{approved}} casino gambling in Atlantic City. Because {{of concerns about}} organized crime connections to gambling, New Jersey enacted strict regulations that included licensing of all casino employees and contractors, and <b>a</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> powers between the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) and the Casino Control Commission (CCC). The Division of Gaming Enforcement {{is part of the}} New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety, and is responsible for investigating casino license applications, monitoring casino operations, and enforcing New Jersey's casino laws and regulations as defined in Title 5, Chapter 12 of New Jersey's statutes, and Title 13, Chapter 69I of New Jersey's Administrative Code. The Casino Control Commission is an independent agency in the state Treasury Department with both quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial powers, and is responsible for creating casino regulations, hearing appeals of DGE penalties, and make decisions on casino licensing. In light of such regulation and the uniqueness of casino gambling, New Jersey's twelve casinos are not {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) or Atlantic City's alcoholic beverage control board.|$|E

5|$|Lynx is rich {{in double}} stars. The second {{brightest}} star in the constellation is 38 Lyncis at magnitude 3.8. When viewed through a moderate telescope, the two components—a brighter blue-white star of magnitude 3.9 and a fainter star of magnitude 6.1 that {{has been described as}} lilac as well as blue-white—can be seen. 15 Lyncis is another star that is found to be a double system when viewed through a telescope, separating into two yellowish stars of magnitudes 4.7 and 5.8 that are 0.9arcseconds apart. The components are a yellow giant of spectral type G8III that is around 4.01 times as massive as the Sun, and a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F8V that is around 3.73 times as massive as the Sun. Orbiting each other every 262 years, the stars are 178 ± 2 light years distant from Earth. 12 Lyncis has a combined apparent magnitude of 4.87. When seen through a telescope, it can be separated into three stars: two components with magnitudes 5.4 and 6.0 that lie at an angular separation by 1.8″ (as of 1992) and a yellow-hued star of magnitude 7.2 at <b>a</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> 8.6″ (as of 1990).

5|$|Marking the raven's {{right wing}} is Eta Corvi, a yellow-white main-sequence star of type F2V that is 1.52 times as massive and 4.87 times as {{luminous}} as the Sun. It is 59 light-years distant from our Solar System. Two debris disks {{have been detected}} orbiting this star, one warm within 3.5 astronomical units and another out at ~150 astronomical units distant. Zeta Corvi marks the raven's neck. It is of apparent magnitude 5.21, separated by 7 arcseconds from the star HR 4691. Located 420 ± 10 light-years distant, it is a blue-white Be star of spectral type B8V, the presence of hydrogen emission lines in its spectrum indicating it has a circumstellar disc. These stars may be an optical double or a true multiple star system, with <b>a</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> at least 50,000 astronomical units and the stars taking 3.5 million years to orbit each other. HR 4691 is itself double, composed of an ageing yellow-orange giant whose spectral type has been calculated at K0 or G3, and an F-type main-sequence star.|$|E
5|$|Sirius is {{a binary}} star system {{consisting}} of two white stars orbiting each other with <b>a</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> about 20 AU (roughly {{the distance between the}} Sun and Uranus) and a period of 50.1 years. The brighter component, termed Sirius A, is a main-sequence star of spectral type early A, with an estimated surface temperature of 9,940K. Its companion, Sirius B, is a star that has already evolved off the main sequence and become a white dwarf. Currently 10,000 times less luminous in the visual spectrum, Sirius B was once the more massive of the two. The age of the system has been estimated at around 230 million years. Early in its lifespan it was thought to have been two bluish white stars orbiting each other in an elliptical orbit every 9.1 years. The system emits a higher than expected level of infrared radiation, as measured by IRAS space-based observatory. This may be an indication of dust in the system, and is considered somewhat unusual for a binary star. The Chandra X-ray Observatory image shows Sirius B outshining its bright partner as it is a brighter X-ray source.|$|E
