White man here, white man there, Samoa is to stand or fall (bar <b>actual</b> <b>seizure)</b> on the Samoan question. And upon this my mind is now really made up.

It {{is the result of the}} past, which we cannot change, but which we must accept and use or suffer by. I have now made up my mind to do all that I may be able--little as it is--to effect a reconciliation between these two men Laupepa and Mataafa; persuaded as I am that there is the one door of hope. And it is my intention before long to approach both in this sense. Now, from the course of our interview, I was pleased to see that you were, if not equally strong with myself, at least inclined to much the same opinion. And in a carefully weighed paper, such as that you read me, I own I should be pleased to have this cardinal matter touched upon. At home it is not, it cannot be, understood: Mataafa is thought a rebel; the Germans profit by the thought to pursue their career of vengeance for Fagalii; the two men are perpetually offered as alternatives--they are no such thing--they are complementary; authority, supposing them to survive, will be impossible without both. They were once friends, fools and meddlers set them at odds, they must be friends again or have so much wisdom and public virtue as to pretend a friendship. There is my policy for Samoa. And I wish you would at least touch upon that point, I care not how; because, although I am far from supposing you feel it to be necessary in the same sense or to the same degree as I do, I am well aware that no man knows Samoa but must see its huge advantages.

In the latter case, the epileptic condition should be classified and its aetiology determined, if possible. Routine or sleep EEG providing interictal epileptiform discharges is a useful aid to differential diagnosis. To obtain EEG recordings during <b>actual</b> <b>seizures,</b> long-term recordings, using either ambulatory equipment or an EEG-video procedure, are usually used. The combination of EEG and video recording, using surface or surgically implanted electrodes, is a procedure of major importance in the evaluation of patients refractory to medical treatment and possible candidates for epilepsy surgery. In cases of epilepsy suspected to be caused by tumour or cerebrovascular disease, neurological investigation does not differ from that routinely used in such conditions. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) techniques have become important aids in the preoperative work-up in cases of chronic therapy-resistant partial epilepsy. MRI has also simplified the identification of minor morphological abnormalities causing partial epilepsy, and is the method of choice in such cases. The sensitivity of MRI is improved by its combination with volumetric measurements and spectroscopy. The use of functional neuroimaging with SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) and PET (positron emission tomography) during seizures provides further information. A promising new development is the co-registration of MRI and functional imaging (dipolar reconstruction of EEG spikes and seizure patterns, SPECT, PET). MRI is a cornerstone of the preoperative work-up, but diagnosis and the choice of therapeutic approach is always based on the clinical picture, EEG, and functional and morphological imaging...|$|R

In the opinion of the witness {{it would not have been}} possible for Nicaragua to send arms to the insurgents in El Salvador in significant amounts (as alleged by the U.S. Government) and over a prolonged period, without this being detected by the U.S. intelligence network in the area...Counsel for Nicaragua, asked the witness several times whether any detection of arms shipments by or through Nicaragua had taken place during the period he was employed by the CIA. (MacMichael) answered repeatedly that there was no such evidence. He also stated that after his employment had terminated, nothing had occurred that would cause him to change his opinion. He termed the evidence that had been publicly disclosed by the U.S. Government concerning Nicaraguan arms deliveries to the El Salvadoran insurgents as both [...] "scanty" [...] and [...] "unreliable". The witness did however state that based on evidence, which had been gathered immediately prior to his employment with the CIA, evidence he had already actually seen, there was substantial evidence that arms shipments were reaching El Salvador from Nicaragua - with the probable involvement and complicity of the Nicaraguan Government - through late 1980 up until the spring of 1981....But this evidence, which most importantly had included <b>actual</b> <b>seizures</b> of weapons, which could be traced to Nicaragua, as well as documentary evidence and other sources, had completely ceased by early 1981.

40|$|Electroencephalogram (EEG) {{has been}} {{traditionally}} {{used to determine}} which brain regions {{are the most likely}} candidates for resection in patients with focal epilepsy.

40|$|The {{matter of}} the {{research}} deals with the elements of fact and law which allow garnishments {{and other forms of}} attachment in the Italian criminal procedure. Particularly, it refers to the fumus commissi delicti element, applied due to the purpose and the rights involved in the specific measure ordered by the Court. The dissertation starts with a chronological analysis (Criminal Procedure Code of 1930) in order to make clear how the <b>actual</b> forms of <b>seizure</b> and confiscating originate in the Italian criminal procedure. They are rather distinguishable, according to their aim, in seizure for evidentiary purposes (Criminal Procedure Code, Article 253), conservative seizure (Criminal Procedure Code, Articles 316 et seq.) and preventive seizure (Criminal Procedure Code, Articles 321 et seq.). All the measures of attachment affect the fundamental rights, as the private propriety and the economic freedom (Constitution, Articles 41 and 42) and the freedom of expression (Constitution, Article 21). The legislative power shall find a balance between the protection of Constitutional rights and the necessity of ensuring the protective and evidentiary purposes of a measure limiting rights. The analysis focuses on the peculiarity of the fumus, the most important element in balancing fundamental rights with the purposes of criminal procedure. In case of seizure for evidentiary purposes, the fumus determines whether a criminal offence may figuratively exist, since the prior necessity is to perpetuate secure evidence. In case of preventive seizure, as the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Cassation appoints, the mere verification of the fumus is not enough. The attachment has the same enforcement of the personal coercive measures, since it affects the fundamental rights, in order to prevent the deterioration in the consequences of a crime or the commission of any further criminal offence.

40|$|AbstractStatement of the problem: There is {{increasing}} interest in reducing burden of illness in families with childhood epilepsy. Evidence suggests that burden of illness is more related to parents’ perception of seizure control than <b>actual</b> <b>seizure</b> control. This {{study examined the}} extent to which parents could describe their children’s epilepsy and its impact. The degree of concordance between parents’ and physicians’ perceptions of epilepsy, and its effect on parents’ satisfaction with care was also examined. Method: The study involved 37 parents and 1 paediatric neurologist. A questionnaire measured parents’ perceptions of seizures and satisfaction with care. A physician questionnaire was piloted for comparison with parent responses. Results: Parents were able to describe and distinguish seizure types, characteristics and impact of epilepsy. Results indicate a low degree of concordance between parents’ and physician’s perceptions for global, medical and everyday aspects of epilepsy. Preliminary evidence suggests that satisfaction with care may be positively related to degree of concordance. Conclusions: It is feasible to examine burden of illness from the parents’ perspective. More attention should be paid to the parent–physician relationship in order for physicians to appreciate parents’ perceptions. Future research is needed to replicate the findings in a larger sample of parents and paediatric neurologists...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} the diagnostic yield and utility of STVEEG with verbal suggestion in diagnosis of patients presenting with transient unresponsiveness and suspected psychogenic nonepileptiform seizures. Methods. A retrospective analysis of STVEEG records {{of patients with}} transient unresponsiveness and suspected PNES between 1 Jan 2009 and 28 Feb 2014 was done. Results. Amongst 155 patients [38 males, 117 females], with mean age 32 [8 – 67], PNES were identified in 109 [70. 3 %], focal epilepsy was identified in 24 [15. 4 %], and <b>actual</b> <b>seizure</b> was recorded in 7 [4. 5 %]. Nine [5. 8 %] patients {{were found to have}} both epilepsy and PNES. Primary generalized epilepsy was diagnosed in 2 [1. 2 %]. A diagnosis of other paroxysmal nonepileptiform events [tachyarrhythmia and heart block] was done in 3 [1. 9 %]. A normal EEG and no inducible episode and hence an uncertain diagnosis at the end of STVEEG were seen in only 17 [10. 9 %] patients. A STVEEG of approximately one hour duration was able to establish the diagnosis in 138 [89. 1 %] patients with transient unresponsiveness. Conclusion.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveVideo {{electroencephalography}} (vEEG) is the gold-standard {{method for}} diagnosing psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), but such assessment is expensive, unavailable in many centers, requires prolonged hospitalization, {{and many times}} is unable to capture an <b>actual</b> <b>seizure</b> episode. This paper systematically reviews other non-vEEG candidate biomarkers that may facilitate both diagnosis and study of PNES as differentiated from epileptic seizures (ES). MethodsPubMed database was searched to identify articles between 1980 and 2015 (inclusion: adult PNES population with or without controls, English language; exclusion: review articles, meta-analyses, single case reports). ResultsA total of 49 studies were examined, including neuroimaging, autonomic nervous system, prolactin, other (non-prolactin) hormonal, enzyme, and miscellaneous marker studies. Functional MRI studies have shown PNES is hyperlinked with dissociation and emotional dysregulation centers in the brain, although conflicting findings are seen across studies and none used psychiatric comparators. Heart rate variability suggests increased vagal tone in PNES when compared to ES. Prolactin is elevated in ES but not PNES, although shows low diagnostic sensitivity. Postictal cortisol and creatine kinase are nonspecific. Other miscellaneous biomarkers (neuron specific enolase, brain derived neurotropic factor, ghrelin, leptin, leukocytosis) showed no conclusive evidence of utility. Many studies are limited by lack of psychiatric comparators, size, and other methodological issues. ConclusionNo single biomarker successfully differentiates PNES from ES; in fact, PNES is only diagnosed via the negation of ES. Clinical assessment and rigorous investigation of psychosocial variables specific to PNES remain critical, and subtyping of PNES is warranted. Future investigational and clinical imperatives are discussed...|$|E

In this study, the aim was to investigate whether ictal tachycardia is present in focal and generalized epileptic seizures in children. We sought to predict in which type of seizures tachycardia can be identified before <b>actual</b> <b>seizure</b> onset. Electrocardiogram segments in 80 seizures were analyzed in time and frequency domains before and after the onset of epileptic seizures on EEG. These ECG parameters were analyzed to find the most informative ones that can be used for seizure detection. The algorithm of Leutmezer et al. was used to find the temporal relationship between the change in heart rate and seizure onset. In the time domain, the mean RR shows a significant difference before compared to after onset of the seizure in focal seizures. This can be observed in temporal lobe seizures as well as frontal lobe seizures. Calculation of mean RR interval has a high specificity for {{detection of}} ictal heart rate changes. Preictal heart rate changes are observed in 70 % of the partial seizures. Ictal heart rate changes are present only in partial seizures in this childhood epilepsy study.

40|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} {{as well as}} antiepileptic drugs (AED) {{may interfere}} with the hypothalamicpituitary axis (HPA) and have neuroendocrine effects. A transient increase of prolactin (PRL) and cortisol in serum after generalised tonic-clonic or complex partial seizures {{has been one of}} the most consistent findings, although absences and myoclonic seizures, as well as seizures of very short duration, do not seem to affect PRL levels. The observation of a PRL increase in connection with epileptic seizures has been used as an aid in differentiating epileptic seizures from psychogenic attacks mimicking epileptic symptoms. In our first study we hypothesised that PRL measurement could also be used to help classify different forms of status epilepticus (SE). However, we found no PRL increase during SE in 15 patients, irrespective of SE type and AED treatment. This finding was confirmed in an extended series of 32 patients with 34 episodes of SE, also as compared with control levels of PRL on a seizure-free day in 16 of the patients Cellular depletion of PRL due to long-standing epileptic activity was discussed as a possible mechanism behind the normal PRL levels in SE. We investigated PRL secretion in patients with SE in two studies by interfering with two different aspects of the PRL regulatory system. In the first, we administered metoclopramide, a dopamine receptor blocker, i. v. in connection with nine cases of SE, and in the second, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) i. v. in seven cases of SE. PRL levels increased in response to the injections in all cases. Thus we found no evidence for cellular depletion. Since growth hormone (GH) and PRL partly share regulating substances, we decided also to study GH serum concentrations in connection with SE. GH levels were normal in 15 cases of SE, irrespective of type of SE and AED treatment. To broaden our understanding of how epilepsy may affect the HPA, we studied patients with epilepsy under three different conditions: interictally during seizure-free periods (n= 6), postictally immediately after a single seizure (n= 6), and during SE (n= 7). The responses of PRL, GH, cortisol, and TSH to TRH were investigated. PRL was elevated in the postictal group, with a further distinct increase after TRH administration. GH levels were normal in relation to seizure activity irrespective of seizure duration, whereas paradoxical GH responses to TRH were seen after both single seizures and SE. Cortisol levels were elevated after epileptic seizures, and this increase was maintained during SE. TSH reactivity to TRH seemed less pronounced in the SE group than in the postictal. Results in the interictal group were similar to those observed in healthy control subjects. Our results demonstrate that both short- and long-standing epileptic seizure activity can alter pituitary hormone concentrations in serum, probably through influences on the regulation of the HPA. The hormonal changes seem related to the <b>actual</b> <b>seizure</b> activity, and not to the epilepsy disorder, nor to the metabolic condition of the patient or the AED treatment...|$|E

The fuel spectrum was kept simple to allow a more fundamental approach by limiting the extent of possible chemical reactions. Both wear and seizure load testing were performed. The effect of water on both tests was found to be:  Wear and friction increased with higher soluble water content. Water therefore interferes with the action of the lubricating additive leading to decreased performance.  It is known that hydroxyl groups, from dissociative chemisorption of water, act as active sites for adsorption. It is however postulated that the associative chemisorption and/or physisorption of water interferes by either reducing the active site availability or reducing activity to ligand exchange.  No iron oxyhydroxides (FeOOH) were detected on the wear scars or tracks using Raman spectroscopy. The adsorbed water therefore likely only interact with the surface due to their low concentrations (10 ~ 50 ppm).

For wear testing the following additional observations were made:  The electric contact resistance (ECR) took longer to increase at higher soluble water content, for all PA concentrations. The equilibrium values attained were also lower, when values were within the measurement range. This again highlights the reduced lubricity performance at higher soluble water content.  Wear scar appearance and colour were uniquely affected at each concentration of PA  Similar trends were observed at 60 °C and 80 °C. At the higher temperature:  Wear scar diameters increased.  Friction coefficients decreased and had less variance.  ECR values were similar, but took longer to increase to a steady value. For seizure load testing the following additional observations were made:  At higher water content, the oscillation-stroke on the test machine used tended to deviate more, before the <b>actual</b> <b>seizure</b> point was reached.  The effects of soluble water were more noticeable at lower PA concentrations.
