It is evident from history that women are the ones who bear the brunt of <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts.</b> In recent years, violence against women in <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> has received much attention. Modern day conflicts have a devastating effect on women's lives. How <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> change the lives of women and transform their whole existence is a matter of serious concern. Besides, <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> disrupt essential social services, on which women depend. Women's concerns during- and post-armed conflicts need to be addressed. However, women are underrepresented in decision-making forums related to conflict prevention and peace building. Post-conflict reconstruction and rehabilitation are essential in providing means of livelihood to these women for their sustenance...|$|R

40|$|Children are {{particularly}} vulnerable individuals and therefore, they have particular rights under international law that recognize their special need for protection. <b>Armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> constitute {{the biggest threat to}} them. I have chosen this topic for admiring the strength of children affected by <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> to face all the problems brought by <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts.</b> On the other hand, children are indispensable in reconciliation and reconstruction of society. The aim of the thesis is to describe and analyze the protection provided by law to the children affected by <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> and the application of those provisions. Chapter One deals with these questions. Chapter Two is introductory and is subdivided into five parts. Part One describes the relation between international humanitarian law (IHL) and international human rights law and their applicability. Part Two deals with the absence of universally applicable definition of "armed conflict" and the applicability of legal instruments. Part Three briefly introduces basic ideas of protection of children in <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts.</b> Part Four defines the term "child" and explains possible problems of universally accepted definition. Part Five analyzes contemporary <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> and the impact on children, whether they participate (directly or indirectly) in [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{violence}} {{in various forms}} is a particular brand of evil that women have endured during <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts,</b> from time immemorial. It {{is a problem that}} has continued to task the conscience of humanity, especially in our times. There has been no shortage of basic laws at the international level that could have tempered the frequency of this scourge. What is needed is a more conscious determination to enforce the existing laws: especially in the manner of more robust and creative interpretation and application. Beginning with an attempt at understanding evildoing during <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts,</b> from both the general perspective and the particular angle of sexual violence itself, this dissertation explores ways of shoring up international legal protection of women from sexual {{violence in}} <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> from certain aspects. The aspects explored include the responsibility of persons in superior positions of authority for the sexual violence that their subordinates commit against women during <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts,</b> definition of rape in international criminal law, commission of genocide through sexual violence, sexual violence as comprised in the war crime of terrorism, sexual violence in internal <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> as grave breaches of international humanitarian norms, and forced marriage during <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> as an emerge...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{protection}} of cultural {{property in the}} event of <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> has become largely mentioned issue. Despite broad international legal codification of principles to prevent destruction of cultural property {{in the event of}} <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts,</b> destruction of cultural property obviously occurs. Within discussion on their protection, attention is not so paid to the values of cultural property representing for interested actors not merely in the event of <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts.</b> Attention is not much paid also to the motivations leading actors to destroy cultural property in the event of <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts.</b> The thesis is based on current state of knowledge both in academic or international law and it focuses on exploring motivations leading actors to destroy cultural property in the event of <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts.</b> To answer the research question: "What motivators are leading actors to actively destroy cultural monuments in armed conflicts?" is proceeded from analysis of literature that expounds the motivations for the destruction of cultural property in the event of <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts.</b> These motivations will be understood as theoretical explanations of destruction {{for the purposes of the}} work, and on the basis of five case studies, their validity will be checked.

40|$|This thesis interrogates the {{applicability}} of the principle of distinction in modern <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts.</b> The distinction between combatants and civilians and between civilian objects and military objectives has become blurred {{as a result of the}} changes that have taken place in modern <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts.</b> While the principle of distinction was tailor made to regulate traditional, conventional <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts,</b> an evolution in the nature, means and methods of warfare has made the application of the principle of distinction challenging. One of the challenges that arise as a result of the changes that have taken place in modern <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> include the difficulty of distinguishing civilians and civilian objects, which are entitled to protection under international humanitarian law from combatants and military objectives which are legitimate targets. This has compromised the protection that the law seeks to offer during <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> since civilians and civilian objects have become constant targets. Another challenge is that the involvement of civilian persons in <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> has made it difficult to determine the responsibility of these individuals as well as the states that hire them for violations of international law during <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts.</b> Furthermore, the emergence of new methods of warfare has resulted in many objects and facilities that are traditionally regarded as civilian objects becoming military objectives, thus losing their protection under international humanitarian law. This thesis will use the examples of the involvement of private military and security companies in <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> as well as the emergence of drone and cyber warfare to illustrate these challenges. The study will examine the application of the principle of distinction to the growing practice of outsourcing of military services to Private Military and Security Companies. Firstly, the study will examine the status of PMSC personnel under the principle of distinction, that is whether they qualify as combatants or civilians. The study will then examine the consequences of PMSC personnel’s participation in <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts.</b> Importantly, the study will explore responsibilities of states that hire private military and security personnel, PMSC companies as well as superiors in charge of PMSC personnel for any violation of international law committed by contractors during <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts.</b> The study will also examine the application of the principle of distinction to drone and cyber warfare. The study will examine the status of drone and cyber operators under the principle of distinction as well as {{the applicability}} of the principle of distinction between civilian objects and military objectives in drone and cyber warfare. The study will discuss some of the problems that arise as result of the introduction of these new methods of warfare, which makes the application of the principle of distinction to modern <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> challenging. The thesis concludes by arguing that while the principle of distinction remains an indispensable concept of international humanitarian law, it needs to be adapted for it to be applicable to modern <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts.</b> Therefore, suggestions shall be made on how the principle can be adapted to ensure that it remains relevant to modern <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts...</b>|$|R
