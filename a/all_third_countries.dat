40|$|Egg {{producers}} in the EU have to comply with legislation dealing with environmental protection, animal welfare and food safety. From 1 January 2012 keeping hens in conventional cages was prohibited and egg producers had to change to either enriched cages or alternative housing systems. The result of all this legislation {{is an increase in}} the cost of producing eggs. At the same time the EU is negotiating with other countries or groups of countries to liberalise trade in agricultural products. These multi- or bilateral negotiations are designed to further liberalise trade by either further reducing import tariffs or removing them altogether. In this report the impact of lowering import tariffs on the competitiveness of the EU egg industry is studied. The results show that the offer price of whole egg powder in 2012 of some third countries is close to the average EU price.

It outlines the existing research, positions the empirics in this context and sets out how the database was constructed. Selected statistics on the EU and the USA are also presented. The dataset measures three key dimensions of mobility regimes: visa requirements, consular coverage abroad and issuing practices. It contains data on the EU-Schengen states in the period 2005 - 2012 for <b>all</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> abroad, and similar but less extensive information on the UK and the USA. Hitherto, this material has not been available in a format easily amenable for research. The database collects and presents the public government data in a systematised and readily viewable form, thereby reducing entry barriers for future studies of migration control. It also contains a Mobility Barriers Index providing restrictiveness scores taking all three dimensions into account. The database thus seeks to facilitate and encourage further quantitative inquiry into mobility barriers, and provides a tool for qualitative researchers to contextualise their findings in a wider case universe...|$|E

40|$|The EU protects {{some of its}} {{fruits and}} {{vegetables}} through the entry price system. This system consists on a two-tiered tariff, with high-priced exports paying an ad valorem tariff, whereas low-priced exports pay also a supplementary specific tariff. The breaking point {{between high and low}} export prices is the entry price level decided by the EU, generally the same level for <b>all</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> In a few cases, some Southern Mediterranean partners of the EU have agreed a reduced entry price for their exports, together with the more common ad valorem tariff reduction. Among the indicators used for gauge the value of preferences, there is no one devoted to this case of reduced entry price, hence we develop a new indicator that allows to split which part of the preferential gains corresponds to the entry price reduction and which part corresponds to the "usual" ad valorem tariff reduction. We apply this methodology to Moroccan clementines trade flows, with two main findings: 1) The entry price reduction ranges up to 39 % of the economic value of preferences in some months; 2) Morocco is not maximizing the gains due to this reduction, and could take some trade and policy lessons, mainly trying to better fit to the concession or, if impossible, use it as negotiating capital in future reviews of the agreement.

It analyses how the common Schengen short-stay visa {{policy has been}} applied in practice by member states in the period from 2005 to 2010. So far, little systematic theoretical and empirical research {{has been carried out}} on the implementation of Schengen. The contributions of the thesis are two-fold. Firstly, it makes available a comprehensive and easily accessible database on the visa requirements, issuing-practices and consular representation of EU states in <b>all</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> It enables researchers to map out and compare how restrictively the visa policy is implemented by different member states and across sending countries. Secondly, the project provides three separate papers that in different ways make use of the database to explore and explain the varying openness of Europe’s border and dynamics of cooperation among member states. The three papers are tied together by a framework conceptualising Schengen as a border regime with two key dimensions: restrictiveness and integration. The first paper asks to what extent, and why, Europe’s border is more open to visitors of some nationalities rather than others. The second paper investigates to what extent, and why, EU states cooperate on sharing consular facilities in the visa-issuing process. The third paper examines to what extent, and why, Schengen participation has a restrictive impact on the visa-issuing practices of member countries. The analyses test existing theories and develop new concepts and models. The three papers engage with rationalist and constructivist theories and seek to assess their relative explanatory power. In doing so, the project makes use of different quantitative comparative approaches. It employs regression analysis, social network analytical tools and quasi-experimental design. Overall, the thesis concludes that Schengen is characterized by extensive cooperation and restrictive practices towards especially visitors from poor, Muslim-majority and refugeeproducing countries...|$|E

For the sake of simplicity these persons are referred to as <b>third</b> <b>country</b> nationals, or immigrants from <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> In the absence of indications to the contrary, these expressions should be understood as comprising three categories of persons who live in a Member State of the European Union [hereinafter ’’Member State”]: first, nationals of a <b>third</b> <b>country</b> who have immigrated into a Member State; secondly, persons born in a Member State but who have the nationality of a <b>third</b> <b>country</b> and, finally, also stateless persons. In 1992 these three categories made up a total of about 10 million persons. The key concern of this thesis is the situation of <b>third</b> <b>country</b> nationals belonging to national or racial groups who are socially disadvantaged. Clearly, in certain areas, Swiss, (white) American or even Japanese entrepreneurs or managers are in a completely different position to that of Algerian, Chinese or Peruvian low-skilled workers. The latter have a far less advantageous socio-economic status in comparison to the former. They are the ones in need of more attention from public institutions and from the society as a whole. Thus, they are the main concern of this thesis. However, in certain other domains, any person not having the nationality of a Member State can confront basically the same problems - like those pertaining to exclusion from the rights granted only to nationals of a Member State.

40|$|Since the Single European Market (SEM) {{has been}} established, the free {{movement}} of goods has been facilitated not only by removing border formalities, {{but also by the}} technical harmonisation of national legislation in each member state. For the agri-food sector a particular concern is to guarantee the safety and integrity of products. In this respect, the European Commission has developed a stringent policy regarding food safety (sanitary and phytosanitary measures) and consumer information (quality measures). Strict regulation is therefore imposed for all agri-food products commercialised in the SEM, whether of European or third countries. In the case of EU enlargement, accession to the SEM is conditional upon the candidate countries accepting the obligations of the internal market, and therefore accepting these principles of free trade. Fulfilling the requirements for EU accession means for acceding countries not only costs related to adjustments of their production technologies in order to be consistent with the acquis communautaire, but also benefits. Particularly, there will be measurable gains for the new member states (NMS), that should benefit from the abolishment of the tariff barriers and the decreasing impact of the non-tariffs measures, once they have adopted the EU standards and from the reduction of the transaction costs. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess the impact of trade barriers on agri-food exports from Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) to the EU on the eve of their integration. Do the gradual tariff reduction and the convergence of production standards implied by the implementation of the acquis communautaire over the pre-accession period reduce the border effect of CECCs agri-food products when entering the European markets? At accession time do these countries enjoy equal access to the EU market as the old EU members do, or are they still in the same situation in terms of market access as any other third country? For answering these questions, a gravity modelling on disaggregated data of agri-food imports of the EU- 15 in 1999 and 2004 is used. The model proposes an adaptation of the border effect methodology initiated by McCallum (1995) and widely used after (see among others Chen, 2004; Mayer and Zignago, 2005). More precisely, the principle of the analysis from the national borders to the external frontiers of the European Union was extended, assuming that the SEM is an integrated area with low trade barriers. In other words, the objective of the paper is to measure the impact of EU borders (called hereafter border effect) and assess the role of tariffs and non tariffs measures (NTMs) in the explanation of this effect. Hence, just before joining the SEM, do NMS still face a significant border effect at entry to the EU market? Has this effect been reduced over the period of preparation for EU accession ? Since most impediments to trade are difficult to measure, the model includes a global measure of trade resistances faced by CEECs at entry to the EU market (as defined by Mayer and Zignago (2005)). First, Results estimated for 1999 and 2004 show the magnitude of the border effect faced by trading partners at entry to the SEM. This effect is captured separately for three geographical zones: new member states (NMS: Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia), acceding countries (AC: Romania, Bulgaria) and rest of the world. For the three groups, the coefficient is significantly negative showing that <b>all</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> exchange less with EU countries than EU members among themselves. Contrary to what might be expected, the border effect is highest for NMS. Second, the border effect is split between tariffs, the impact of NTMs and remaining trade resistance for third countries at entry to the EU market. Concerning the impact of tariffs, the results highlight the reduction in tariff elasticity for NMS whilst this coefficient remains stable for the rest of the world. It is noteworthy that tariffs no longer act as a trade barrier anymore in 2004 for NMS. This is an expected result, since tariffs for NMS were abolished in May 2004, the date of the EU enlargement. However, in 1999 the impact of tariffs was still high because the liberalisation process was far from complete. Regarding NTMs, three dummies indicating respectively whether sanitary, phytosanitary or quality measures exist are included in the model. Sanitary measures include veterinary measures for animals (breeding and production) designed to protect both animal and public health. Phytosanitary measures refer to standards defining the maximum residue level of pesticides. Quality measures cover the set of standards relating to product quality control, other than sanitary and phytosanitary requirements, for instance commercial characteristics such as freshness, calibration, labelling and conditioning. For NMS, the impact of NTMs on exports towards EU- 15 should expectedly tend to be similar to those for the intra EU- 15 trade at the moment of accession to the EU. Such a result in 2004 would clearly suggest the positive role of the acquis communautaire. The impact of NTMs on traded volume is not clear and according to the literature can both stimulate or reduce traded volume. In order to distinguish the decision to trade from the volume traded and to analyse impact of NTMs on those two steps, the gravity model proposed was estimated using the Heckman procedure. Obtained results show that for NMS, sanitary measures do not act as a barrier to trade at entry to the EU market and even significantly stimulate traded volume for NMS firms fulfilling sanitary requirements. For ACs these measures still act as barrier to trade, and once the barrier has been overcome, traded volume is lightly increasing. Phytosanitary measures do not act as barrier to trade at entry to the EU market for CEECs product (both from NMS and ACs) but still limit traded volume. These results call for two comments. The first comment deals with the CEECs fulfilments of the EU requirement (in other word, the adoption and implementation of the acquis communautaire). Sanitary measures have been fulfilled in NMS leading to a non significant impact of such measures on decision to trade, whereas for ACs it was not the case, justifying therefore the transition period imposed by European authorities. Concerning phytosanitary measures, they do not act as trade barriers for CEECs product rather because the use level of pesticide is structurally low in those countries than because of the technological changes related to the implementation of the acquis communautaire. The second comment deals with the opposite impacts of sanitary and phytosanitary measures on traded volume. Results concerning sanitary measures is easily explained because the high degree of food safety policies integration in the EU. Since the BSE crisis the European authorities have harmonised their sanitary measures to a very high degree. The harmonisation is much more complete in the sanitary field than in the other. Fulfilment of the EU sanitary requirements by NMS firms therefore enhances their traded volume. Phytosanitary and quality measures, far from integration on the SEM, still limit traded volume. Even the intra EU- 15 trade is concerned by the negative role of those measures both on the decision to trade and on the traded volume. Results also show border effect is not totally explained by tariffs and NTMs; remaining trade resistances are still significant. In other words, determinants other than tariffs and NTMs explain trade resistance at entry to the EU market. This is particularly true for NMS for which the border effect remains high. How can this remaining high level of trade resistance be explained? Among transition-related factors that impede trade and are difficult to measure, the low quality of transport infrastructures, the lack of expertise of foreign firms in doing business with these countries, as well as institutional uncertainties surrounding the transition process can be mentioned. The role of history also offers some explanations for the geographical orientation of CEECs traders away from the EU (trade flows between the Czech and Slovak Republics, between the Baltic states, and between Slovenia and former Yugoslavia still remain quite strong). This is what Anderson and van Wincoop call the multilateral trade resistances.

In his assessments of the arrests of April 24, 1915 the authors argues that the state had only aimed at taking under control the activities of the revolutionaries, and the assertions that the arrests of these political figures was a preparation for the process to exterminate the Armenians is groundless. It is also argued in this article that the decision of relocations has been taken as a legal security measure and that the Armenian uprisings were the principle reason for this decision to be taken. Also discussed in this article are the number of people relocated and the ratio of deaths which took place during the marches of the convoys to the designated locations in southern parts of the Ottoman Empire. The author emphasising the importance of studying the events of 1915 {{on the basis of the}} archival documents welcomes the letter of the Turkish Prime Minister to the President of Armenia to the effect that an historical commission consisting of historians and other experts from two countries should be established to study the developments and events of 1915 not only in the archives of Turkey and Armenia but also in the archives of <b>all</b> relevant <b>third</b> <b>countries...</b>|$|R

They do this through social cohesion activities, language education and wider education and life-long learning services. The position of <b>third</b> <b>country</b> nationals in the labour force is often weak, especially women and those with low levels of education. There is a need for more focused strategies to make the recognition of existing qualifications easier and quicker. Austerity policies have had an impact on <b>third</b> <b>country</b> nationals because they have resulted in cuts to services, e. g. social cohesion, which were specially targeted at <b>third</b> <b>country</b> nationals.
