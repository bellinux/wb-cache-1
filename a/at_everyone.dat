25|$|Nolan {{accepted}} the pass as real but his writings show his frustration that Parker was competing {{for his own}} mission. Cooper wrote that Nolan swore and let loose {{a long series of}} invective frustration <b>at</b> <b>everyone</b> who seemed to be against 'his' mission. It took him a while to calm down. He then asked Parker questions where the Comanche raiders were and where they were headed. Parker glanced toward one direction and pointed off in a different direction while Tafoya translated. Parker never used English with Nolan even though he spoke it well.|$|E
25|$|The Grub Street Opera is {{the first}} truly {{political}} play and also Fielding's first ballad opera. As such it owes a lot to Fielding's model, John Gay's The Beggar's Opera. Unlike his other Scriblerus plays, Fielding's Scriblerus persona in The Grub-Street Opera is deeply connected to Gay instead of Gay's fellow members of the Scriblerus Club, Alexander Pope or Jonathan Swift. As in The Welsh Opera, this connection served {{as a means to}} put forth a general political view and deal with politics in a more critical way unlike any of Fielding's previous plays. The play is a political allegory that satirises Walpole's government and the British monarchy. However, the play does not pick a side but pokes fun <b>at</b> <b>everyone.</b> He also kept his personal political views out of the play.|$|E
25|$|After meeting another {{character}} of the Trilogy, Jan Skrzetuski, Zagłoba, until now living a meaningless life of a lesser noble, trying to survive by exploiting the good faith of others, becomes drawn into the company of hero-like personas, and slowly changes, to become worthy of their trust and friendship. Together with them, Zagłoba engages in various adventures, fighting for the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and seeking adventures and glory. During a feast, in a rather drunken state, {{he was the first}} to call prince Janusz Radziwiłł a traitor. Eventually he becomes a widely known person, treated with respect by powerful magnates and offering counsel to the king. He was balding and half-blind, known for his love of drinking and story-telling (usually glorifying his own exploits), tendency to poke fun <b>at</b> <b>everyone</b> and everything, later also renowned as a cunning tactician.|$|E

25|$|Asher's scars are {{hesitant}} {{around the}} face and groin, noted by Anita that {{it was as if}} the Priests flinched at the destruction of such beauty. The Priests (never said which denomination, but it is assumed Catholic) used Holy Water in an attempt to save Asher's soul (from what is never said, either). Asher is moody with a sadistic mean streak, lashing out <b>at</b> <b>everyone</b> in his fits of melancholic pain. He wants most to be loved and devoted by Jean-Claude, more a lover of men than women. Asher knows that it is through Anita's attraction to him combined with Jean-Claude's that Jean-Claude returns the love. Without Anita's acceptance, Jean-Claude could never bring himself to nearly be consumed for want of Asher again. That coupled with the incident of Asher nearly bleeding Anita to death during their first and only exclusive sexual experience leads to Asher's emotional neglect. Neither Anita nor Jean-Claude trust themselves alone with Asher, but as a trio, they live in nearly perfect love.|$|E
500|$|... "Hairography" [...] was {{watched by}} 6.1 million US viewers and {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal deemed the mash-up performance {{one of the}} worst of the season, with Zap2it's Liz Pardue agreeing that it was [...] "hideous". Flandez, Pardue and Mike Hale of The New York Times all felt that it was inappropriate for New Directions to interrupt the deaf choir's performance of [...] "Imagine", however Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle opined that reviewers needed to [...] "realize that this show takes its jabs <b>at</b> <b>everyone,</b> but it always has a wink and a hug and lots and lots of love behind it".|$|E

Samaha acknowledged that [...] "everyone thought I was crazy or mentally retarded" [...] for taking on the project, but pitched the film as [...] "Planet of the Apes starring John Travolta". Others in Hollywood were still skeptical; an unnamed producer was quoted by the Los Angeles Daily News as saying that [...] "Battlefield Earth has the stench of death. It {{should never have been}} made. It's an $80million vanity project for Travolta." [...] Travolta's theatrical agency William Morris was also said to be unenthusiastic, reportedly leading to Travolta threatening to leave them if they did not help him to set up the film. Fellow Scientologist Tom Cruise was said to have warned Warner Bros. that he thought the movie was a bad idea. Cruise's spokesperson later denied this.|$|E

500|$|The Wolverines {{were the}} {{unanimous}} pre-season Number 1 pick in 1981 but lost their opener to Wisconsin 2114.

I want nothing more to do with you," [...] and left. According to the coach, Muransky and Edwards were the only two who played with intensity against Wisconsin, and Bo left it to them to motivate the rest of the team. Muransky issued a challenge to the offense on the night before the following week's game: [...] "I looked <b>at</b> <b>everyone</b> and said, 'If we continue to play as great individuals, we'll continue to lose. If we start to play as a great team, we'll start winning." [...] The next day, the Wolverines beat #1 ranked Notre Dame, 257.|$|E

Kennedy for the Los Angeles Times was {{generally}} more positive regarding the episode's musical performances, however {{was critical of}} the ongoing pregnancy plot, noting that he cringed whenever Quinn appeared on screen. Conversely, Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle enjoyed Quinn in the episode, writing: [...] "I love that she can keep her Mean Girls edge while being heartbreakingly sad or as joyful as she was singing [...] "Papa Don't Preach". He countered criticism of the portrayal of New Directions' rival choirs, suggesting: [...] "at this point, everyone needs {{to realize that this}} show takes its jabs <b>at</b> <b>everyone,</b> but it always has a wink and a hug and lots and lots of love behind it." [...] Entertainment Weekly Dan Snierson reviewed the episode positively, calling the [...] "Imagine" [...] performance [...] "a classic feel-good Glee moment, teeming with sappy but undeniable heart", while Aly Semigran of MTV deemed it her favorite musical moment from the show, feeling that it: [...] "honored the classic song in such a respectful way." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{important}} to the band that [...] "Sticks & Bricks" [...] opened the album, as it was an [...] "in-your-face" [...] song.

He stated that it [...] "is one of the meaner, heavier songs that we've ever done as a band." [...] "All I Want" [...] is [...] "about being in a band", according to McKinnon, and was one of the final songs written for the album. The song came about from an idea by McKinnon that he expanded on guitar in the middle of recording for the album, and wrote most of it in one night. A rough version was recorded between McKinnon and producer Chad Gilbert before the band had arrived at the studio. McKinnon said the song was more of a [...] "singing version" [...] of the band's song [...] "I'm Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of?".|$|E

500|$|Peter {{mentions}} {{starring in}} Starlight Express, {{which is a}} rock musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber; although Peter's role as shown onscreen {{has little to do}} with the actual performance. While Stewie and Chris are lost in the forest overnight, Stewie plays a guessing game with one of the answers being Thornton Melon. Stewie looks at the television audience wondering why the majority of them chose Thornton Melon, then Stewie notes that Thornton Melon was the character that Rodney Dangerfield played in the 1986 film Back to School. It was in fact a quote by Henry David Thoreau. Stewie's reference to a newspaper headline saying [...] "Stewie Defeats Truman" [...] is a takeoff of the famous [...] "Dewey Defeats Truman" [...] headline, which erroneously predicted that Thomas E. Dewey would defeat Harry S. Truman in the 1948 presidential election. Peter's new career as a psychic is a parody of John Edward and his TV series Crossing Over. While the police depend on Peter to help them find someone, Peter stalls by pretending to channel the spirit of Lou Costello; his exchange with Joe about the missing man, Mr. Hu who lives on First Street, is a takeoff of the famous Abbott and Costello routine [...] "Who's on First?". Also, there was a cutaway to the Enterprise from the original [...] series showing Spock winning the lottery (with the numbers 18, 24, 41 and 72), then cussing <b>at</b> <b>everyone</b> shortly before leaving. Nana Visitor voices the Enterprise viewscreen, while series writer and producer John Viener voices Spock in the cutaway.|$|E

In July 2010, she placed Miles second on her list of best soap characters. She spoke about how [...] "ridiculous storylines" [...] {{turn out to}} be great onscreen and referred to Miles's visions of Rabbit, which she went on to praise. She said [...] "Miles's grief, his visions of Rabbit and his torment <b>at</b> <b>everyone</b> telling him she wasn't real were devastating to watch, and this was a really interesting avenue to take one of the soap's best-loved characters down that could have spectacularly backfired, but instead, had people bawling their eyes out." [...] Holy Soap have said that Miles's most memorable moment is [...] "When he found student Trey trying to kiss Kirsty, Miles pushed him and found his job as a teacher in jeopardy". The website also named Miles as one their Summer Bay hunks. In 2010, the Daily Record said that [...] "poor old Miles" [...] had a so many problems that [...] "he was probably happier when everybody thought he was just sister Sally's friend". After Miles became involved with Shandi, they stated that true love [...] "never ran smoothly in Summer Bay" [...] and that with Shandi; Miles got [...] "a lot more than he first bargained for".

2500|$|Like tragedy, comedy {{arose from}} a ritual {{in honor of}} Dionysus, {{but in this case}} the plays were full of frank obscenity, abuse, and insult. At Athens, the comedies became an {{official}} part of the festival celebration in 486 BC, and prizes were offered for the best productions. As with the tragedians, few works still remain of the great comedic writers. The only complete surviving works of classical comedy are eleven plays written by the playwright Aristophanes. These are a treasure trove of comic presentation. He poked fun <b>at</b> <b>everyone</b> and every institution. In The Birds, he ridicules Athenian democracy. In The Clouds, he attacks the philosopher Socrates. In Lysistrata, he denounces war. Aristophanes has been praised highly for his dramatic skill and artistry. John Lemprière's Bibliotheca Classica describes him as, quite simply, [...] "the greatest comic dramatist in world literature: by his side Molière seems dull and Shakespeare clownish." [...] Of all Aristophanes's plays, however, the one that has received the most lasting recognition is The Frogs, which simultaneously satirizes and immortalizes the two giants of Athenian tragedy: Aeschylus and Euripides. When it was performed {{for the first time at}} the Lenaia Festival in 405 BC, just one year after the death of Euripides, the Athenians awarded it first prize. It was the only Greek play that was ever given an encore performance, which took place two months later at the City Dionysia. Even today, The Frogs still appeals to modern audiences. A commercially successful modern musical adaptation of it was performed on Broadway in 2004.|$|E
