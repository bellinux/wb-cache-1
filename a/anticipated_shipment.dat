40|$|Risk {{assessment}} {{has become}} an increasingly important and essential tool in support of Federal decision-making regarding the handling, storage, disposal, and transportation of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and high-level radioactive waste (HLW). This paper analyzes the current statutory and regulatory framework and related legal precedents with regard to SNF and HLW transportation. The authors identify key scientific and technical issues regarding the use and defensibility of risk assessment in Federal decision-making regarding <b>anticipated</b> <b>shipments...</b>|$|R
25|$|It {{was also}} the missions' {{responsibility}} to provide the Spanish forts, or presidios, with the necessary foodstuffs, and manufactured goods to sustain operations. It was a constant point of contention between missionaries and the soldiers as to how many fanegas of barley, or how many shirts or blankets the mission had to provide the garrisons on any given year. At times these requirements were hard to meet, especially during years of drought, or when the much <b>anticipated</b> <b>shipments</b> from the port of San Blas failed to arrive. The Spaniards kept meticulous records of mission activities, and each year reports submitted to the Father-Presidente summarizing both the material and spiritual status {{at each of the}} settlements.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} myths and legends {{attributed}} to the neighbourhood's nickname and people such as Jason Cundy acknowledge {{that some of them}} are quite implausible but are re-told because those were the tales they grew up believing. One of the legends states that in the warmer months, when the port saw shipments from far and exotic places, women would <b>anticipate</b> the <b>shipments</b> of molasses. When they knew of an upcoming shipment, they would go to the docks and bring a small container with them. Apparently, there was this unspoken understanding between a particular crane operator at the time and the women. The crane operator would [...] "accidentally" [...] drop the last barrel of molasses and the women would quickly fill their containers with the fallen substance.|$|R
40|$|Approximately 5 to 10 million {{packages}} of radioactive material and wastes are shipped {{annually in the}} US. Most of these shipments consist of small quantities of medical and research isotopes. However, larger quantities of radioactive wastes are shipped by the US Department of Energy (DOE) via commercial truck or rail service. The number of shipments of radioactive waste {{is expected to increase}} {{over the next several years}} as efforts to dispose of waste stored and generated at DOE sites progress. The potential for a severe accident involving these <b>anticipated</b> waste <b>shipments</b> is small, but not insignificant. The probability of a severe accident resulting in the largest credible release of material has been estimated to range from approximately 0. 01 to 0. 1 over the 20 -year time period considered for permanent disposal of each of the low-level, transuranic, and high-level radioactive waste types (LLW, TRUW, and HLW). The potential radiological consequences of the most severe credible accident involving each of these waste types could adversely affect the community in which it occurred. These consequences are considered here. Accidents involving spent nuclear fuel (SNF) shipments are of concern to the public and are also considered. In this paper, a pathway analysis code, the RISKIND computer program, has been used as a screening tool to help develop an example action plan for both the early and intermediate phases of an accident involving the release of radioactive materials. RISKIND was developed for the analysis of radiological consequences and health risks to individuals and the collective population from exposures associated with the transport of SNF or other radioactive materials. RISKIND was developed by Argonne National Laboratory under the support of the DOE Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management...|$|R
40|$|The Nevada Test Site (NTS) {{has been}} {{identified}} in recent, national U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) reports as playing {{a key role in}} the future disposal of low-level radioactive waste (LLW) originating from waste management, site remediation, and other programs of the DOE Complex. The potential volumes and characteristics of these wastes [...] as well as their proposed shipment to the NTS [...] are of particular interest and concern to stakeholders in Nevada and in potential, shipment-corridor states. As part of the independent, Nevada Risk Assessment/Management Program (NRAMP), human health risk assessments are being developed with regard to NTS disposal areas and the proposed shipments of LLW to the NTS. In support of this work, good estimations of the volumes and characteristics of the wastes, and of the <b>anticipated</b> number of <b>shipments</b> to the NTS from generator sites, are needed. This paper describes historic disposal statistics and current estimations of projected shipments of LLW to the NTS from identified generator sites, including estimated shipment volumes, the characteristics of key, projected waste streams, and current uncertainties that impact the reliability of the data.
