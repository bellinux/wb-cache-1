40|$|This paper {{presents}} a quasi-static configurational force (CF) brittle fracture propagation method, [1], using the discontinuous Galerkin (dG) symmetric interior penalty (SIP) method, [2]. The method {{is derived from}} the first law of thermodynamics with consideration of the Griffith fracture criterion [1]. The criterion is evaluated by finding the difference between the power applied to the domain and the rate of internal energy change at every point in the domain. If a node within the element mesh satisfies the criterion, a crack will propagate in the CF direction. Around the crack tip the advantage of element specific degrees of freedom in dG methods enables simple p-adaptivity to determine the CF in the spatial domain. In the material domain r-adaptivity is implemented, where the CF direction is used to <b>align</b> <b>element</b> edges, which are then split to propagate the crack...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} mesh quilting, a geometric texture synthesis algorithm {{in which}} a 3 D texture sample given {{in the form of}} a triangle mesh is seamlessly applied inside a thin shell around an arbitrary surface through local stitching and deformation. We show that such geometric textures allow interactive and versatile editing and animation, producing compelling visual effects that are difficult to achieve with traditional texturing methods. Unlike pixel-based image quilting, mesh quilting is based on stitching together 3 D geometry elements. Our quilting algorithm finds corresponding geometry elements in adjacent texture patches, <b>aligns</b> <b>elements</b> through local deformation, and merges elements to seamlessly connect texture patches. For mesh quilting on curved surfaces, a critical issue is to reduce distortion of geometry elements inside the 3 D space of the thin shell. To address this problem we introduce a low-distortion parameterization of the shell space so that geometry elements can be synthesized even on very curved objects without the visual distortion present in previous approaches. We demonstrate how mesh quilting can be used to generate convincing decorations for a wide range of geometric textures...|$|R

Societal functions are fulfilled by socio-technical systems, which consist of a cluster of <b>aligned</b> <b>elements,</b> e. g. artefacts, knowledge, user practices and markets, regulation, cultural meaning, infrastructure, maintenance networks and supply networks. To understand how transitions from one socio-technical system to another come about, the article describes a conceptual multi-level perspective. The perspective is illustrated with a historical case study: the transition from horse-drawn carriages to automobiles in the USA (1860 - 1930). The case study shows that technological substitution approaches to this transition are too simple, because they neglect the electric tram and bicycle, which acted as important stepping stones. The case study also corrects another mistake, namely that the gasoline car won by chance from steam and electric automobiles. It will be shown that particular niches {{played a crucial role in}} this competition, as well as the wider socio-technical context. The case study deviates on three points from the multi-level perspective. These deviations are used to conceptualize a particular transition pathway, called 'de-alignment and re-alignment'...|$|R

40|$|Human {{observers}} tend {{to group}} oriented line segments into full contours if {{they follow the}} Gestalt rule of ’good continuation’. It is commonly assumed that contour grouping emerges automatically in early visual cortex. In contrast, recent work in animal models suggests that contour grouping requires learning and thus involves top-down control from higher brain structures. Here we explore mechanisms of top-down control in perceptual grouping by investigating synchronicity within EEG oscillations. Human participants saw two micro-Gabor arrays in a random order, with the task to indicate whether the first (S 1) or the second stimulus (S 2) contained a contour of collinearly <b>aligned</b> <b>elements.</b> Contour compared to non-contour S 1 produced a larger posterior post-stimulus beta power (15 – 21 Hz). Contour S 2 {{was associated with a}} pre-stimulus decrease in posterior alpha power (11 – 12 Hz) and in fronto-posterior theta (4 – 5 Hz) phase couplings, but not with a post-stimulus increase in beta power. The results indicate that subjects used prior knowledge from S 1 processing for S 2 contour grouping. Expanding previous work on theta oscillations, we propose that long-range theta synchrony shapes neural responses to perceptual groupings regulating lateral inhibition in early visual cortex...|$|R

Additional consensus elements of the nucleotide binding site in these two proteins were derived from comparisons of T antigen primary and predicted secondary structures with x-ray structures of the nucleotide binding sites in four otherwise unrelated proteins. Each of these elements was predicted to be encompassed within a 110 -residue segment that is highly conserved between the two T antigens residues 418 - 528 in SV 40 T antigen and residues 565 - 675 in PyV). Results of biochemical and immunologic experiments on the nucleotide binding behavior of these proteins were found to be consistent with these predictions.

40|$|With {{little to}} no {{experience}} using a Document Management System (DMS), Brunswick management is concerned that adopting a DMS will increase development and maintenance time, thereby increasing our time to market with new releases, bug-fixes, and/or service packs. It is {{the intent of this}} project to prove that the extra amount of time documenting our systems will ultimately provide a benefit to Brunswick by saving time during the maintenance phase which, will last for many years after the initial launch. And as an added benefit of this project, a specific DMS tool has been identified and evaluated throughout this project that will fulfill our immediate needs or can at least serve as a benchmark for another vendor. The Scorer Configuration Utility project was chosen to highlight the benefits of a DMS. In part, because this is a typical case where knowledge of the processing that must take place has been lost as personnel have left the organization. This loss of knowledge has cost Brunswick an indeterminable amount of money over the years and will continue to increase cost as long as a DMS is not a part of our culture. The Scorer Configuration Utility project provides a means to format the scorer registry settings, via a USB connection, before they are installed. This will speed up the replacement time by pre-configuring the hard-drive prior to installation. Now, the pinsetter type, overhead display type, console password, lane identification, IP Address, and Server name can all be configured prior to installing a hard-drive. I describe in detail how the Vector Plus server interacts with the scorers registry which control/manage eight lanes of bowling each. I go on to describe how the registry settings specify how the scorers interact with peripheral devices such as the pinsetters, overhead displays, and the lane consoles and that incorrect registry settings render these devices non- functional.

The collinear vs. parallel comparison is made while manipulating contrast, spatial frequency, eccentricity, phase, orientation jitter and element separation. Results show a clear effect of contrast not observed in lateral masking paradigms or in 'pathfinder' stimuli, with higher contrast promoting within-frame grouping, and evidence of facilitatory interactions among parallel elements (although over a smaller scale).

We used a two-dimensional visco-elastic spring model based on a discrete element approach to study the dynamic development of foliation boudinage and the behaviour of anisotropic visco-elastic material deformed under pure shear conditions.
