40|$|Lignocellulosic {{material}} (LCM) can {{be employed}} as feedstock for biorefineries, a concept related to industries designed to process biomass for producing chemicals, fuels and/or electrical power. According to this philosophy, LCM can be fractionated and the resulting fractions employed for specific applications. Bioethanol production from cellulosic fraction of LCM involves: hydrolysis of polysaccharides and fermentation of the monomers into bioethanol. Enzymatic hydrolysis is catalyzed by cellulolytic enzymes and fermentation is carried out by bacteria, yeasts or fungi. The main objective {{of this article is}} to review different process integration technologies for bioethanol production from LCM. This paper include: separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF), simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), and simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) methods.

40|$|Aims A {{literature}} review of existing {{research on the}} prevalence of alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and availability of alcohol interventions in Europe was conducted. The review also explored {{what is known about}} the gap between need and provision of alcohol interventions in Europe. Methods The review search strategy included: (i) descriptive studies of alcohol intervention systems in Europe; (ii) studies of alcohol service provision in Europe; and (iii) studies of prevalence of AUD and alcohol needs assessment in Europe. Results Europe has a relatively high level of alcohol consumption and the resulting disabilities are the highest in the world. Most research on implementation of alcohol interventions in Europe has been restricted to screening and brief interventions. Alcohol needs assessment methodol-ogy has been developed but has not been applied in comparative studies across countries in Europe.

As a result, there lacks <b>a</b> <b>comparative</b> empirical <b>data</b> on the intra-national differences that shape migration flows and many of the characteristics and changes of these differences are still unknown.

The findings suggest that political orientation is the strongest predictor of negative attitudes toward illegal immigration in all three countries. In addition, we find that exposure to commercial news broadcasting is positively related to negative attitudes toward illegal immigration in the United States, France, and Norway.

30|$|Here {{we should}} mention several factors, which were also the {{stimulus}} for us to conduct this research. F.e., no studies of this kind had been made which took into account different phenotypes of obesity. Further, according to some data [in particular, <b>a</b> <b>comparative</b> <b>data</b> on omental and subcutaneous fat tissue UCP 1 expression (Esterbauer et al. 1998)], the greater omentum fat depot may have brown as well as white fat tissue properties. Multilocular adipocytes, which are characteristic for brown fat tissue, are found though in omental fat only in very special situations (Frontini et al. 2013). Nevertheless, the supposed plasticity or trans differentiation of adipocytes and their predecessors [allowing also white fat tissue cells acquire some brown fat cells characteristics (Smorlesi et al. 2012)] draws additional attention to omental fat functional abilities, which determine whether it is closer to white or brown fat tissue in postmenopausal EC patients. Therefore, this was another reason for interest in fat tissue markers (especially UCP 1 and omentin) expression comparison in EC patients with “standard” and “metabolically healthy” obesity.|$|E
