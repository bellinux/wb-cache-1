25|$|Factor Analysis for Robust Microarray Summarization (FARMS) is a model-based {{technique}} for summarizing <b>array</b> <b>data</b> at perfect match probe level. It {{is based on}} a factor analysis model for which a Bayesian maximum a posteriori method optimizes the model parameters under the assumption of Gaussian measurement noise. According to the Affycomp benchmark FARMS outperformed all other summarizations methods with respect to sensitivity and specificity.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, dynamic arrays (as well as fixed-size <b>array</b> <b>data</b> structures) allow constant-time random access, while linked lists allow only {{sequential}} access to elements. Singly linked lists, in fact, {{can be easily}} traversed in only one direction. This makes linked lists unsuitable for applications where it's useful to look up an element by its index quickly, such as heapsort. Sequential access on arrays and dynamic arrays is also faster than on linked lists on many machines, because they have optimal locality of reference and thus {{make good use of}} data caching.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{arbitrarily}} {{many elements}} may be inserted into a linked list, {{limited only by}} the total memory available; while a dynamic array will eventually fill up its underlying <b>array</b> <b>data</b> structure {{and will have to}} reallocate— an expensive operation, one that may not even be possible if memory is fragmented, although the cost of reallocation can be averaged over insertions, and the cost of an insertion due to reallocation would still be amortized O(1). This helps with appending elements at the array's end, but inserting into (or removing from) middle positions still carries prohibitive costs due to data moving to maintain contiguity. An array from which many elements are removed may also have to be resized in order to avoid wasting too much space.|$|E

500|$|The RNA {{interference}} pathway {{is often}} exploited in experimental biology {{to study the}} function of genes in cell culture and in vivo in model organisms. Double-stranded RNA is synthesized with a sequence complementary to a gene of interest and introduced into a cell or organism, where it is recognized as exogenous genetic material and activates the RNAi pathway. Using this mechanism, researchers can cause a drastic decrease in {{the expression of a}} targeted gene. Studying the effects of this decrease can show the physiological role of the gene product. Since RNAi may not totally abolish expression of the gene, this technique is sometimes referred as a [...] "knockdown", to distinguish it from [...] "knockout" [...] procedures in which expression of a gene is entirely eliminated. In a recent study validation of RNAi silencing efficiency using gene <b>array</b> <b>data</b> showed 18.5% failure rate across 429 independent experiments.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Minimizing data {{communication}} over processors {{is the key}} to compile programs for dis-tributed memory multicomputers. In this paper, we propose new data partition and alignment techniques for partitioning and aligning <b>data</b> <b>arrays</b> with a program in a way of minimizing communication over pro-cessors. We use skewed alignment instead of the dimension-ordered alignment techniques to align <b>data</b> <b>arrays.</b> By developing the skewed scheme, we can solve more complex programs with minimized {{data communication}} than that of the dimension-ordered scheme. Finally, we compare the proposed scheme with the dimension-ordered alignment one by experimental results.
