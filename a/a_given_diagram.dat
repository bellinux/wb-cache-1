40|$|This is an {{extended}} abstract {{for the paper}} [?] written in Chinese. Geometry Expert (GEX) is a software for dynamic geometric drawing and automated geometry theorem proving and discovering [?]. With GEX, we can draw geometric diagrams dynamically, that is, we can change these diagrams in a continuous way {{and at the same}} time keeping the geometric relations in the figure intact. This feature of GEX provides a powerful and convenient platform for teaching mathematical concept in an intuitive way. With GEX, we have proved hundreds of difficult geometry theorems and generated elegant proofs [?]. Furthermore, we can use GEX to build a database which contains all the properties of <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>diagram</b> that can be deduced using a set of geometric axioms. With this feature, teachers can easily make exercises and test problems; students can enhance their ability of solving problems by fully explore the properties of <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>diagram.</b> By dynamic models, we mean models built by computer softwares that can be changed dynamically. In this series of papers, we shall show how to build dynamic models for various mathematical concepts using GEX. We will consider the following four classes of models. 1.

40|$|We take up {{the study}} of {{integrable}} structures behind non-planar contributions to scattering amplitudes in N= 4 N= 4 super Yang-Mills theory. Focusing on leading singularities, we derive {{the action of the}} Yangian generators on color-ordered subsets of the external states. Each subset corresponds to a single boundary of the non-planar on-shell diagram. While Yangian invariance is broken, we find that higher-level Yangian generators still annihilate the non-planar on-shell diagram. For <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>diagram,</b> the number of these generators is governed by the degree of non-planarity. Furthermore, we present additional identities involving integrable transfer matrices. In particular, for diagrams on a cylinder we obtain a conservation rule similar to the Yangian invariance condition of planar on-shell diagrams. To exemplify our results, we consider a five-point MHV on-shell function on a cylinder...|$|E
