5|$|As {{part of the}} {{evacuation}} plan agreed with the DAO, Air <b>America</b> committed 24 of its 28 available helicopters to support {{the evacuation}} and 31 pilots agreed to stay in Saigon to support the evacuation; this meant that most helicopters would have only one pilot rather than the usual two.

5|$|At 11:00 the {{security}} situation at the Air <b>America</b> compound was deteriorating as General Carey {{did not wish to}} risk his Marines by extending his perimeter to cover the Air <b>America</b> compound (LZ 40), so all Air <b>America</b> helicopters from this time operated out of the tennis courts in the DAO Annex (LZ 35).
