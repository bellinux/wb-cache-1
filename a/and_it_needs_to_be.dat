25|$|The primary urge {{to breathe}} is {{triggered}} by rising carbon dioxide (CO2) {{levels in the}} bloodstream. Carbon dioxide builds up in the bloodstream when oxygen is metabolized <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> expelled as a waste product. The body detects carbon dioxide levels very accurately and relies on this as the primary trigger to control breathing. Hyperventilation artificially depletes the resting concentration of carbon dioxide causing a low blood carbon dioxide condition called hypocapnia. Hypocapnia reduces the reflexive respiratory drive, allows the delay of breathing and leaves the diver susceptible to loss of consciousness from hypoxia. For most healthy people {{the first sign of}} low oxygen levels is a greyout or unconsciousness: there is no bodily sensation that warns a diver of an impending blackout.|$|E

Kubrick read Pudovkin's seminal {{theoretical}} work, Film Technique, which argues that editing makes film a unique art form, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> employed to manipulate the medium to its fullest. Kubrick recommended this work to others for many years. Thomas Nelson describes this book as [...] "the greatest influence of any single written work on the evolution of [...] private aesthetics". Kubrick also found the ideas of Konstantin Stanislavski to be essential to his understanding the basics of directing, and gave himself a crash course to learn his methods.|$|E

2500|$|Ryan {{helped to}} renew the {{national}} debate on capital punishment when, as governor, he declared a moratorium on his state's death penalty in 2000.

[...] Criminals set up phony companies, then invoice Medicare for fraudulent services provided to valid Medicare patients who never receive the services. These costs appear on the Medicare statements provided to Medicare card holders. The program pays out over $430 billion per year via over 1 billion claims, making enforcement challenging.
