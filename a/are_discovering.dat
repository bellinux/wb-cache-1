2500|$|It {{has been}} a topic of {{discussion}} of who is {{held accountable for the}} collection and distribution of personal information. Some will say that it is the fault of the social networks because {{they are the ones who}} are storing the vast amounts of information and data, but others claim that it is the users who are responsible for the issue because it is the users themselves that provide the information in the first place. This relates to the ever-present issue of how society regards social media sites. There is a growing number of people that <b>are</b> <b>discovering</b> the risks of putting their personal information online and trusting a website to keep it private. Yet in a recent study, researchers found that young people are taking measures to keep their posted information on Facebook private to some degree.

2500|$|While purgatory was disputed by the reformers, the Early Patristic Theologians of the Eastern Church {{taught and}} {{believed}} in [...] "apokatastasis", {{the belief that}} all creation would be restored to the original perfect condition after a remedial purgatorial reformation. St. Clement of Alexandria {{was one of the}} early church theologians who taught this view through key scriptures. Many today <b>are</b> <b>discovering</b> that the reformers did an injustice to Early Christian understandings concerning purgatorial restoration. [...] Protestants have always contended that there are no second chances. However, Lutherans have a similar doctrine of what may happen to the unevangelized in a book titled What about those who never heard.

6000|$|The {{religious}} movement which I {{think is}} going on is of a subtler and a deeper sort altogether. Men <b>are</b> <b>discovering</b> {{that human beings are}} finer than they had supposed. A young man said to me: [...] "Well, I don't know about religion, but I know that my opinion of human nature is about fifty per cent. better than it was." [...] That conclusion has been arrived at by countless thousands. It is a great factor--seeing that the belief of the future will be belief in the God within; and a frank agnosticism concerning the great [...] "Why" [...] of things. Religion will become the exaltation of self-respect, of what we call the divine in man. [...] "The Kingdom of God" [...] is within you. That belief, old as the hills, and reincarnated by Tolstoi years ago, has come into its own in the war; for it has been clearly proved to be the real faith of modern man, underneath all verbal attempts to assert the contrary. This--the white side of war--is an extraordinarily heartening phenomenon; and if it sent every formal creed in the world packing there would still be a gain to religion.|$|E
6000|$|The {{suppression}} of every error is commonly {{followed by a}} temporary ascendency of the contrary one; and so it happened, that after the ages when physical development alone was aimed at, there came an age when culture of the mind was the sole solicitude--when children had lesson-books put before them at between two and three years old, and the getting of knowledge was thought the one thing needful. As, further, it usually happens that after one of these reactions the next advance is achieved by co-ordinating the antagonist errors, and perceiving that they are opposite sides of one truth; so, we are now coming to the conviction that body and mind must both be cared for, {{and the whole thing}} being unfolded. The forcing-system has been, by many, given up; and precocity is discouraged. People are beginning to see that the first requisite to success in life, is to be a good animal. The best brain is found of little service, if there be not enough vital energy to work it; and hence to obtain the one by sacrificing the source of the other, is now considered a folly--a folly which the eventual failure of juvenile prodigies constantly illustrates. Thus we <b>are</b> <b>discovering</b> the wisdom of the saying, that one secret in education is [...] "to know how wisely to lose time." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{security}} of the British monarchy lies in such a courageous severance of its destinies from the Teutonic dynastic system. Will it make that severance? There I share an almost universal ignorance. The loyalty of the British is not to what kings are too prone to call [...] "my person," [...] not to a chosen and admired family, but to a renascent mankind. We have fought in this war for Belgium, for France, for general freedom, for civilization and the whole future of mankind, far more than for ourselves. We have not fought for a king. We <b>are</b> <b>discovering</b> in that spirit of human unity that lies below {{the idea of a}} League of Free Nations the real invisible king of our heart and race. But we will very gladly go on with our task under a nominal king unless he hampers us in the task that grows ever more plainly before us. ... That, I think, is a fair statement of British public opinion on this question. But every day when I am in London I walk past Buckingham Palace to lunch at my club, and I look at that not very expressive fa√ßade and wonder--and we all wonder--what thoughts are going on behind it and what acts are being conceived there. Out of it there might yet come some gesture of acceptance magnificent enough to set beside President Wilson's magnificent declaration of war. ...|$|E

60|$|Let me refer {{again to}} that word that I used; death--the amount of death. I really {{believe there are}} {{hundreds}} of good and kind people who would take up this subject with their whole heart and soul if they were aware of the magnitude of the evil. Lord Shaftesbury told you just now that there were one hundred thousand preventable deaths in England every year. So it is. We talk of the loss of human life in war. We are the fools of smoke and noise; because there are cannon-balls, forsooth, and swords and red coats; and because it costs a great deal of money, and makes a great deal of talk in the papers, we think: What so terrible as war? I will tell you what is ten times, and ten thousand times, more terrible than war, and that is outraged Nature. War, we <b>are</b> <b>discovering</b> now, is the clumsiest and most expensive of all games; we are finding that if you wish to commit an act of cruelty and folly, the most costly one that you can commit is to contrive to shoot your fellow-men in war. So it is; and thank God that so it is; but Nature, insidious, inexpensive, silent, sends no roar of cannon, no glitter of arms to do her work; she gives no warning note of preparation; she has no protocols, nor any diplomatic advances, whereby she warns her enemy that war is coming. Silently, I say, and insidiously she goes forth; no! she does not even go forth; she does not step out of her path; but quietly, by the very same means by which she makes alive, she puts to death; and so avenges herself of those who have rebelled against her. By the very same laws by which every blade of grass grows, and every insect springs to life in the sunbeam, she kills, and kills, and kills, and is never tired of killing; till she has taught man the terrible lesson he is so slow to learn, that, Nature is only conquered by obeying her.|$|E
