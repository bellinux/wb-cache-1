He {{was the son of}} Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, and Eleanor of Portugal. He ruled jointly with his father for the last ten years of his father's reign, from c. 1483 to 1493.|$|E
25|$|Launceston {{operated}} a suburban tramway system between 1911 and 1952, {{which consisted of}} 29 trams. It was first conceived in 1909, after observations of efficiently working systems in Melbourne and Adelaide. A decade before the tram system was abandoned, Launceston had begun converting to trolleybuses, especially for the hilly routes. The Launceston trolleybus system {{was one of the}} most extensive of the various trolleybus systems in Australia. The tramway network was finally removed in 1952 to make way for cars and buses. A tramway museum in Inveresk is all that remains of Launceston's trams. Launceston's streets, most of which were planned in the early nineteenth century, were probably <b>always</b> <b>too</b> narrow for trams to be fully successful: in many cases little of the roadway remained for other forms of transport.|$|E

25|$|Both Worcestershire Royals and Glamorgan Dragons were {{knocked out}} before the last round of the Twenty20 Cup group stage, so the match at New Road was fairly academic. It did not stop Worcestershire from {{amassing}} {{one of the highest}} scores in Twenty20 Cup history with 223 for 9 - Ben Smith only taking 45 balls to smack 105 off the Glamorgan bowlers, with twelve fours and six sixes, as he lifted his career Twenty20 average from 15 to 20.62. The partnership of 149 with Graeme Hick was enough to win the match for Worcestershire, as Glamorgan never quite got the hang of Shoaib Akhtar - who bowled two overs for 14 with a no-ball and a wide. Glamorgan ended up only losing five wickets, but 224 was <b>always</b> <b>too</b> much to ask, and they finished with a total 186 for 5.|$|E
25|$|Derbyshire {{played host to}} a team of South Africans in 1901, as {{the young}} Test nation played a series of eleven warm-up matches against English county sides prior to a Test series against the English cricket team. However, a {{publicity}} boost such as this only served to panic an ever-spiralling Derbyshire team into once again finishing in bottom place in the table. The following year, 1902, was slightly more encouraging for Derbyshire, as, boosted {{by the appearance of}} long-time Warwickshire player Thomas Forrester, after three years out of the game, Derbyshire finished in their highest position since the beginning of Bestwick's career, finishing the season in tenth place. Bestwick bowled very well in a summer when pitches were almost <b>always</b> <b>too</b> wet to suit a bowler of his pace, and was probably the second best fast bowler in county cricket after William Lockwood.|$|E
25|$|The Air {{forces in}} Angola {{were under the}} command of the 2nd Air Region of the Portuguese Air Force, with {{headquarters}} in Luanda. They included a central air base (the Air Base 9 at Luanda) and two sector air bases (the Base-Aerodrome 3 at Negage, Uíge and the Base-Aerodrome 4 at Henrique de Carvalho, Lunda). A fourth air base was being built (Base-Aerodrome 10 at Serpa Pinto, Cuando-Cubando), but it was not completed {{before the end of the}} conflict. These bases controlled a number of satellite air fields, including maneuver and alternate aerodromes. Besides these, the Air Force also could count with a number of additional airfields, including those of some of the Army garrisons, in some of which air detachments were permanently deployed. The Air Force also maintained in Angola, the Paratrooper Battalion 21, which served as a mobile intervention unit, with its forces initially being deployed by parachute, but latter being mainly used in air assaults by helicopter. The Air Force was supported by the voluntary air formations, composed of civil pilots, mainly from local flying clubs, who operated light aircraft mainly in air logistics support missions. In the beginning of the conflict, the Air Force had only a few aircraft stationed in Angola, including 25 F-84G jet fighter-bombers, six PV-2 Harpoon bombers, six Nord Noratlas transport aircraft, six Alouette II helicopters, eight T-6 light attack aircraft and eight Auster light observation aircraft. By the early 1970s, it had available four F-84G, six PV-2 Harpoon, 13 Nord Noratlas, C-47 and C-57 transport aircraft, 30 Alouette III and Puma helicopters, 18 T-6 and 26 Dornier Do 27 observation aircraft. Despite the increase, the number of aircraft was <b>always</b> <b>too</b> few to cover the enormous Angolan territory, besides many being old aircraft difficult to maintain in flying conditions. From the late 1960s, the Portuguese forces in southern Angola were able to count with the support of helicopters and some other air assets of the South African Air Force, with two Portuguese-South African joint air support centers being established.|$|E

500|$|On {{top of a}} poor {{commercial}} showing at the {{box office}} in 1960, critical reception to Crossroads to Crime has remained consistently negative. Anderson once called it [...] "possibly the worst film ever made", while Elliott considers it [...] "awful". Cohen and Levy were similarly unimpressed and offered Anderson no further commissions for Anglo-Amalgamated. During the promotional campaign for Thunderbirds Are Go, made by AP Films' successor company Century 21 and released in 1966, Sylvia Anderson said of the earlier film, [...] "The less said about it, the better"; she has since commented that it [...] "hardly ranks as one of our best efforts". A contemporary review in Monthly Film Bulletin was more positive: [...] "Quick off the mark, this modest little thriller soon settles down into a routine 'cops and robbers' format, efficient if not <b>always</b> <b>too</b> convincing." [...] Stronger praise came in the October 1960 issue of Kine Weekly, which commended Crossroads to Crime as being [...] "refreshingly free from pretence", adding: [...] "The film's moral is lofty, its tender domestic asides encourage feminine interest, and the climax is a corker." ...|$|E

500|$|Expressed {{justifications}} {{for refusing to}} obey laws because of conscience vary. Many conscientious objectors are so for religious reasons—notably, members of the historic peace churches are pacifist by doctrine. Other objections can stem from {{a deep sense of}} responsibility toward humanity as a whole, or from the conviction that even acceptance of work under military orders acknowledges the principle of conscription that should be everywhere condemned before the world can ever become safe for real democracy. A conscientious objector, however, does not have a primary aim of changing the law. John Dewey considered that conscientious objectors were often the victims of [...] "moral innocency" [...] and inexpertness in moral training: [...] "the moving force of events is <b>always</b> <b>too</b> much for conscience". The remedy was not to deplore the wickedness of those who manipulate world power, but to connect conscience with forces moving in another direction- to build institutions and social environments predicated on the rule of law, for example, [...] "then will conscience itself have compulsive power instead of being forever the martyred and the coerced." [...] As an example, Albert Einstein who had advocated conscientious objection during the First World War and had been a longterm supporter of War Resisters' International reasoned that [...] "radical pacifism" [...] could not be justified in the face of Nazi rearmament and advocated a world federalist organization with its own professional army.|$|E
500|$|Maggie's {{first word}} was {{provided}} by the Academy Award-winning actress Elizabeth Taylor, who would also voice herself in the season four finale, [...] "Krusty Gets Kancelled". While promoting the episode, the producers initially did not reveal who the voice of Maggie would be, prompting speculation as to the identity of the actress. Although it was only one word, the voice came out [...] "too sexy" [...] and Taylor had to record the part numerous times before the producers were satisfied and thought it sounded like a baby. Several sources, including John Ortved's The Simpsons history article [...] "Simpsons Family Values" [...] in Vanity Fair, have reported that after Taylor had been made to repeatedly record the line, she said [...] "fuck you" [...] to series creator Matt Groening and stormed out of the studio. Groening recounted this event on a 1994 appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, and was also quoted by the New York Daily News in 2007 as saying [...] "We did 24 takes, but they were <b>always</b> <b>too</b> sexual. Finally Liz said, 'F— you,' and walked out." [...] However, Groening later denied the story in the DVD commentary for the episode [...] "Gump Roast", while Jean stated in a piece after Taylor's death in 2011 that Taylor had said [...] "fuck you" [...] in jest and in Maggie's voice and did not storm out.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} the game was first {{conceived}} as the production team thought that endless runner games were popular but were <b>always</b> <b>too</b> similar. To create an endless runner that would differentiate itself from others in the genre, the staff focused on Spider-Man's main powers, which originally led to a swinger-only game. However, they found it [...] "a bit boring", and it was complicated to have boss fights and to add new systems and gameplay styles. Then they reconceptualized the game as a runner with elements of swinging, fighting, wall-climbing, and free-falling. The storyline of the game was created {{to focus on the}} Sinister Six and the multiple versions of Spider-Man. Gameloft was allowed to explore other stories such as the Spider-Verse, but they were required to consult with Marvel to decide which were to be featured. The product manager, Tatiana Nahai, was the responsible for choosing among the options and she discusses the ideas with the narrative designer. After the narrative designer creates the main plotline and dialogues, they consult Marvel writer Fred Van Lente for feedback. The same process of having Marvel feedback occurs for the addition of new characters and environments. Environments were created by the level design team, which was responsible for deciding which obstacles or types of boss attacks fit best, based on how distinct they would be from other levels. As new updates were released, new environments like the New York Highline, 2099 New York and snowy New York were added.|$|E

Russell felt that the film would be a hard one to market. [...] "This is a difficult picture to sell because it's hard to explain.
