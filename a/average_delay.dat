(2) For the <b>average</b> packet <b>delays</b> of MLS schemes, it is {{achieved}} that the <b>average</b> packet <b>delays</b> at all relays {{are the same}} entirely when the S-R and R-D links follow the i.i.d fading channels, respectively. Moreover, the <b>average</b> packet <b>delays</b> are also independent from the transmit power and the channel fading severity factors. However, under the i.ni.d fading channels, the <b>average</b> packet <b>delays</b> at all relays are different. This phenomenon yields that the MLS systems are unstable. At the same time, it is also achieved that when the powers of S-R links are less than the ones of R-D links, the <b>average</b> packet <b>delays</b> can be reduced evidently.|$|R

25|$|The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth {{has found}} that, while pledgers {{are more likely}} to abstain until {{marriage}} than non-pledgers – 99% of whom will have sex before marriage – 88% of the pledgers studied had vaginal intercourse before marriage. Out of those who pledge, there was a significant delay in first experience with vaginal intercourse, with an <b>average</b> <b>delay</b> of 18 months. However, people who took a virginity pledge were found to be less likely to have protected sex upon initiation and less likely to get STI tested if a concern arose.|$|E
25|$|Academies and {{societies}} served to disseminate Enlightenment science by publishing the scientific works of their members, {{as well as}} their proceedings. At the beginning of the 18th century, the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, published by the Royal Society of London, was the only scientific periodical being published on a regular, quarterly basis. The Paris Academy of Sciences, formed in 1666, began publishing in volumes of memoirs rather than a quarterly journal, with periods between volumes sometimes lasting years. While some official periodicals may have published more frequently, there was still a long delay from a paper’s submission for review to its actual publication. Smaller periodicals, such as Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, were only published when enough content was available to complete a volume. At the Paris Academy, there was an <b>average</b> <b>delay</b> of three years for publication. At one point the period extended to seven years. The Paris Academy processed submitted articles through the Comité de Librarie, which had the final word on what would or would not be published. In 1703, the mathematician Antoine Parent began a periodical, Researches in Physics and Mathematics, specifically to publish papers that had been rejected by the Comité.|$|E

[...] Firstly, Breyer believed longer delays are cruel, noting that solitary confinement had been criticized by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture. [...] Repeatedly issuing and then revoking death warrants is, according to Breyer, also cruel, noting that, before being exonerated, Willie Jerome Manning, Randall Dale Adams, Clarence Brandley, and Earl Washington, Jr. had all come within days or hours of being executed, multiple times. In light of the death row phenomenon, Breyer did not find it surprising that many inmates volunteer to be executed. [...] Breyer next noted the hostility foreign common law courts have shown to delays before executions in Pratt v A-G for Jamaica (1993), S v Makwanyane (1995), Soering v United Kingdom (1989), and United States v Burns (2001).|$|E

5000|$|Backpressure {{has been}} shown to work in {{conjunction}} with flow control via a drift-plus-penalty technique. [...] This technique greedily maximizes a sum of drift and a weighted penalty expression. The penalty is weighted by a parameter V that determines a performance tradeoff. This technique ensures throughput utility is within O(1/V) of optimality while <b>average</b> <b>delay</b> is O(V). Thus, utility can be pushed arbitrarily close to optimality, with a corresponding tradeoff in <b>average</b> <b>delay.</b> Similar properties can be shown for average power minimization and for optimization of more general network attributes.|$|E

40|$|In {{asynchronous}} systems, <b>average</b> function <b>delays</b> principally govern overall throughput. This paper {{compares the}} performance of six adder designs {{with respect to their}} <b>average</b> <b>delays.</b> Our results show that asynchronous adders (32 or 64 -bits) with a hybrid structure (e. g., carry-select adders) run 20 - 40 % faster than simple ripple-carry adders. Hybrid adders also outperform high-cost, strictly synchronous conditional-sum adders. 1 Introduction In clocked digital systems, speed and throughput is typically limited by the worst case delays associated with the slowest module in the system. For asynchronous systems, however, system speed may be governed by actual executing delays of modules, rather than their calculated worst case delays, and improving predicted <b>average</b> <b>delays</b> of modules (even those which are not the slowest) may often improve performance. In general, more frequently used modules have greater influences on overall performance. Statistics presented in [7] show that in a protot [...] ...|$|R
