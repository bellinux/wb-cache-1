40|$|Introduction: Hearing is the sensorial {{system that}} helps mankind in the {{acquisition}} {{and development of}} the oral language and enables their insertion into the socio-cultural environment. Objective: To characterize the hearing of children since birth until 14 years and 11 months of age, living in Itajaí. Method: Prospective study whose population was composed by inhabitants of the urban region of the city of Itajaí, SC. All individuals living in the sorted houses were included in the audiological evaluation, and the collective, commercial and non-inhabited dwellings were excluded. The children older than 4 years old were evaluated as for the acoustic meatus, audiological selection in the frequencies of 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz, research of acoustic reflexes and tympanometry. In the children younger that 3 years and 11 months the behavioral and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions evaluations were carried out. Results: From the 119 children evaluated, the occurrence of some kind of <b>auditory</b> <b>deficiency</b> was of 16. 84 % in the children older than four years, in the analysis of the best ear. No case of incapacitating <b>auditory</b> <b>deficiency</b> was found. When we matched the behavioral evaluation results of children aged up to three years and 11 months with the results from the tympanometry of the research of ipsilateral acoustic reflexes and transient otoacoustic emissions, we confirmed the occurrence of 59. 10 % of audiological alterations, and from these there were alterations predominantly in the tympanometry and acoustic reflexes, which suggested conductive problems. Conclusion: This confirms the importance of acting for the promotion and prevention of conductive hearing losses, by attempting to provide the children with the development of language and learning fully and effectively...|$|E

40|$|Individuals with {{profound}} deafness have damages {{in the inner}} and outer hair cells in the cochlea. For this reason they make only little use of frequency information and thus have minimal capacities to perceive speech sound cues. Accordingly, speech perception without augmentative means is impossible for them. Profoundly deaf children have been deprived of sound from very early stages of their lives, which inevitably has an effect on linguistic development. Cochlear implants (CIs) have proved their advantage in compensating <b>auditory</b> <b>deficiency</b> both in adults and children {{with profound}} hearing loss. In Helsinki University Hospital cochlear implantations started in the early 1980 s for 10 Finnish adults with profound deafness. Since that time, due to the fast development of speech processing strategies introduced to CIs, high frequencies and temporal features important to the discrimination of consonantal cues and understanding continuous speech are now often available.

40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 1984 The {{study is}} {{concerned}} with learning disabled children. A literature survey which deals with the definitions, causes and manifestations of learning disabilities was conducted. An aid programme, focussing specifically on the auditory modality, was developed. Through a careful study of relevant literature {{it is clear that}} although a learning disabled child possesses adequate or even above-average intellectual capabilities, deficiencies such as abnormal behaviour and inadequacies in learning which may be ascribed to malfunctions in the central nervous system, are manifested. The causes of learning disorders could be of an external or inherent nature and behavioural manifestations such as motor- or perceptual deficiencies, hyperactivity and inadequate academic performance frequently occur. The importance of the auditory perceptual skills in the acquisition of reading and spelling performances is emphasized. Research on <b>auditory</b> <b>deficiencies</b> and their subsequent detrimental effect on reading and spelling performance, indicate a significant relationship between these deficits and the impairment of analysis, synthesis, storing and recalling of auditory information. This survey was conducted in order to devise an auditory aid programme by means of which deficits in auditory perception could be overcome or improved and to decide whether the improvement of auditory deficits would contribute positively towards the reading and spelling results of the learning disabled child. From the literature a variety of exercises for the improvement of the various auditory perceptual skills were assembled. An integrated reading and spelling programme to stimulate the development of-auditory skills was subsequently devised and applied by means of the experimental method This aid programme was applied with great success in six cases who had previously been identified as learning disabled candidates. It resulted in a remarkable improvement in auditory skills of all six participants. All of them performed according to their mental age standard. Basic reading and spelling abilities improved accordingly. Those participants who best overcame their <b>auditory</b> perceptual <b>deficiencies</b> also gave the best performance in reading and spelling abilities. Master...|$|R
40|$|Cocaine is a {{psychostimulant}} in the pharmacological {{class of}} drugs called Local Anesthetics. Interestingly, cocaine {{is the only}} drug in this class that has a chemical formula comprised of a tropane ring and is, moreover, addictive. The correlation between tropane and addiction is well-studied. Another well-studied correlation is that between psychosis induced by cocaine and that psychosis endogenously present in the schizophrenic patient. Indeed, both of these psychoses exhibit much the same behavioral as well as neurochemical properties across species. Therefore, in order to study the link between schizophrenia and cocaine addiction, we used a behavioral paradigm called Acoustic Startle. We used this acoustic startle paradigm in female versus male Sprague-Dawley animals to discriminate possible sex differences in responses to startle. The startle method operates through auditory pathways in brain via a network of sensorimotor gating processes within auditory cortex, cochlear nuclei, inferior and superior colliculi, pontine reticular nuclei, in addition to mesocorticolimbic brain reward and nigrostriatal motor circuitries. This paper {{is the first to}} report sex differences to acoustic stimuli in Sprague-Dawley animals (Rattus norvegicus) although such gender responses to acoustic startle have been reported in humans (Swerdlow et al. 1997 [1]). The startle method monitors pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) as a measure of the loss of sensorimotor gating in the brain&# 039;s neuronal <b>auditory</b> network; <b>auditory</b> <b>deficiencies</b> can lead to sensory overload and subsequently cognitive dysfunction. Cocaine addicts and schizophrenic patients as well as cocaine treated animals are reported to exhibit symptoms of defective PPI (Geyer et al., 2001 [2]). Key findings are: (a) Cocaine significantly reduced PPI in both sexes. (b) Females were significantly more sensitive than males; reduced PPI was greater in females than in males. (c) Physiological saline had no effect on startle in either sex. Thus, the data elucidate gender-specificity to the startle response in animals. Finally, preliminary studies show the effect of cocaine on acoustic startle in tandem with effects on estrous cycle. The data further suggest that hormones {{may play a role in}} these sex differences to acoustic startle reported herein...|$|R

However, the evidence is not conclusive in supporting a similar positive correlation in the case of dyslexic children. The results of the studies in this area have been divided as to whether the inability to make sound-symbol associations is the cause for the reading disability. The purpose of this study was to determine if dyslexic children with <b>auditory</b> processing <b>deficiencies</b> could learn <b>auditory</b> skills and use the acquired auditory skills to progress in reading. Seven seventh grade dyslexic children were matched with an equal number of dyslexic children in a control group for IQ (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test), auditory skills (Lindamood Auditory Conceptualization Test [...] LAC), age (12 - 13. 4 years), sex (F- 2, M- 5), and grade (7). The experimental group received 30 sessions, with 35 minutes of instruction each session, of the Auditory Discrimination in Depth (ADD) program during a nine-week period. The control group received regular reading instruction for the same period. The results showed that the experimental group learned the auditory skills as taught in the ADD program, however, the acquisition of the auditory skills was not correlated with a short-term improvement in reading achievement. The findings suggested that an <b>auditory</b> processing <b>deficiency</b> may accompany the disorder of dyslexia, but it is not one of the underlying causes for the reading disability. It would appear from studies in hemispheric specialization that dyslexic children process information predominantly in a right hemisphere manner (Witelson, 1977). There also has been evidence to show that the right hemisphere can interfere with left hemisphere functioning (Smith, Chu, & Edmonston, 1977). Thus, the findings of this study suggested that while the predominantly right hemisphered dyslexic children learned the auditory skills (left hemisphere processing), they were unable to utilize the acquired skills in reading because of possible right hemisphere interference with left hemisphere functioning...|$|R

40|$|Age-related hearing loss, {{known as}} presbyacusis, is {{characterized}} by the progressive deterioration of auditory sensitivity associated with the aging process and {{is the leading cause of}} adult <b>auditory</b> <b>deficiency</b> in the USA. Presbyacusis is described as a progressive, bilateral, high-frequency hearing loss that is manifested on audiometric assessment by a moderately sloping pure tone audiogram. Approximately 23 % of the population between 65 and 75 years of age, and 40 % of the population older than 75 years of age are affected by this condition. It was estimated in 1980 that 11 % of the population was 76 years or older and this number is expected to almost double by the year 2030. When one considers that the population over 65 years of age is experiencing the most accelerated development of hearing loss, the potential socioeconomic ramifications are staggering. Curiously, the frequency of presbyacusis varies across different societies. This discrepancy has been attributed to many factors including genetics, diet, socioeconomic factors, and environmental variables. The purpose of this article is to review the various molecular mechanisms underlying presbyacusis and to offer insights into potential methods of mitigating the effects of aging on hearing impairment Key words: aging, mitochondrial DNA mutations, presbyacusis, reactive oxygen species...|$|E

40|$|During 1976 {{teachers}} in Taranaki, {{as in other}} parts of New Zealand, were expressing concern for children who appeared to make scant progress in language skills despite the best endeavours of teacher and pupil. Discussions with psychologists and education department officers resulted, in a research programme being structured to survey such a group. In view of the then current interest in visual and <b>auditory</b> perception <b>deficiencies</b> which were believed to contribute to learning difficulties, investigations were to be made of several strategies. It was planned to institute proceedings which would not only remedy deficiencies but could also become the basis for preventive action with similar pupils at an earlier age. At that time teachers were available to allow staffing of the project and so two schools were selected for field trials. Teacher nominations of candidates were tested and groups of children isolated who would benefit from the programme. Staff training commenced to build up a set of practices which would subsequently be modified as experience was gained. Teachers were also helped to devise monitoring behaviours to ensure adequate and comparable data collection strategies were instituted. During the investigation, changes in approach were made as programmes developed and from new insights resulting from concurrent reviews of the literature which became available. Two major shifts occurred, the second resulting in the abandonment of some major precepts concerning remedial programming. Investigations are still proceeding related to the early identification and preventive aspect. THE PROPOSAL It is now time {{to go back to the}} beginning. At that stage the writer held certain beliefs on causation and remediation of reading disabilities which became the basis for examining the hypotheses: • That learning disabled children present a number of neuro-sensory deficits which led to their disability. • That remedial programmes which build up these areas and reading programmes which are tailored to avoid use of those deficits will result in improved performance...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in {{the type}} II transmembrane serine {{protease}} 3 (TMPRSS 3) gene cause non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness (DFNB 8 / 10), characterized by congenital or childhood onset bilateral profound hearing loss. In order to explore the physiopathology of TMPRSS 3 related deafness, we have generated an ethyl-nitrosourea-induced mutant mouse carrying a protein-truncating nonsense mutation in Tmprss 3 (Y 260 X) and characterized the functional and histological consequences of Tmprss 3 <b>deficiency.</b> <b>Auditory</b> brainstem response revealed that wild type and heterozygous mice have normal hearing thresholds up to 5 months of age, whereas Tmprss 3 (Y 260 X) homozygous mutant mice exhibit severe deafness. Histological examination showed degeneration of the organ of Corti in adult mutant mice. Cochlear hair cell degeneration starts {{at the onset of}} hearing, postnatal day 12, in the basal turn and progresses very rapidly toward the apex, reaching completion within 2 days. Given that auditory and vestibular deficits often co-exist, we evaluated the balancing abilities of Tmprss 3 (Y 260 X) mice by using rotating rod and vestibular behavioral tests. Tmprss 3 (Y 260 X) mice effectively displayed mild vestibular syndrome that correlated histologically with a slow degeneration of saccular hair cells. In situ hybridization in the developing inner ear showed that Tmprss 3 mRNA is localized in sensory hair cells in the cochlea and the vestibule. Our results show that Tmprss 3 acts as a permissive factor for cochlear hair cells survival and activation at the onset of hearing and is required for saccular hair cell survival. This mouse model will certainly help to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying DFNB 8 / 10 deafness and cochlear function. Lydie Fasquelle, Hamish S.

40|$|Previous {{characterizations}} of arithmetic disabled children with intact reading skills have been rather discrepant. The {{purpose of the}} present study was to first determine whether or not a sample of arithmetric disabled children with intact reading skills was, in fact, heterogeneous with respect to their patterns of academic performances on the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) Reading, Spelling, and Arithmetic subtests. If this sample of children was indeed heterogeneous, would the resulting subtypes of children differ with respect to their patterns of neurocognitive skills and their ratings on a measure of personality functioning (i. e., PIC: Personality Inventory for Children). A group of 156 children exhibiting WRAT Arithmetic centile scores less than 27 and Reading centile scores greater than 40 were culled from a database of over 4800 children who had been referred to a multi-servive mental health clinic because of suspected central processing deficiencies. All 156 children were between the ages of 9 - 14 years, obtained Full Scale IQ 2 ̆ 7 s between 85 - 115 on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), and were free from any visual or <b>auditory</b> perceptual acuity <b>deficiencies</b> and environmental deprivation. All children spoke English as their primary language. In order to determine if this sample of children was indeed heterogeneous with respect to academic performances, WRAT Reading, Spelling and Arithmetic scores were subjected to several hierarchical clustering procedures. Concurrent validation of the cluster solutions was provided by multivariate and univariate analysis of variance using variables not included in the initial classification: 22 neuropsychological measures and selected PIC scales. Application of the initial cluster analytic techniques and subsequent validation procedures suggested the presence of four subtypes which were differentiated significantly on academic, neurocognitive and personality measures.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} functions in the individual development is the interaction and integration of each sensory input. There exist two competing theories, i. e. the deficiency theory and the compensatory theory, regarding the origin and nature of changes in visual functions observed after <b>auditory</b> deprivation. The <b>deficiency</b> theory proposed that integrative processes are essential for normal development. In contrast, the compensatory theory stated that the loss of one sense may be met by a greater reliance upon, therefore an enhancement of the remaining senses. Given that hearing impaired children’s learning depends primarily on visual information, {{it is important to recognize}} the differences of visual attention between them and their hearing age-mates. Differences among age groups could exist in either selectivity or sustained attention. Study 1 and study 2 explored the selective and sustained attention development of hearing impaired and hearing students with average cognitive ability, aged from 7 years to college students. The analysis and discussion of the results are based on the visual attention development as well as deficiency theory and compensatory theory. According to the results of the study 1 and study 2, the spatial distribution and controlling of the visual attention between hearing impaired and hearing students were also investigated in the study 3 and study 4. The present work showed that: Firstly, both hearing impaired and hearing participants had the similar developmental trajectory of the sustained attention. The ability of children’s sustained attention appeared to improve with age, and in adolescence it reached the peak. The hearing impaired participants had the comparable sustained attention skills to the matched hearing ones. Besides, the results of the hearing impaired participants showed that they could maintain their attention and vigilance on the current task over the observation period. Secondly, group differences of visual attention development were found between hearing impaired and hearing participants. In the childhood, the visual attention developmental speed of the hearing impaired children was slower than that of the hearing ones. The selective attention skill of the hearing impaired were not comparable to the hearing ones, however, their selective skill improved with age, so in the adulthood, hearing impaired students showed the slight advantage in the selective attention skill over the hearing ones. Thirdly, hearing impaired and hearing participants showed the similar spatial distribution in the attention resources. In the low perceptual load condition, both participants were suffered great interference of the distrator at the fixation. In contrast, in the high perceptual load condition, hearing impaired adults were suffered more interference of the peripheral distractor, which suggested that they distributed more attention resources to the peripheral field when faced difficult tasks. Fourthly, both groups showed similar processing in the visual attention tasks. That is, they both searched the target with only the color feature in a parallel way, but in a serial way while processing orientation feature and the features with the combination of the color and orientation. Furthermore, the results indicated that two groups show similar ways in the attention controlling. In summary, the present study showed that visual attention development was dependent upon the integration of multimodal sensory information. Because of the interaction and integration of the input from various sensory, it has a negative impact on the intact sensory at the early stage of one sensory loss, however, it can better the functions of other intact sensory gradually with development and practice. 各种感觉通道输入的交互作用和整合对个体发展非常重要。对一个感觉系统的损坏就会影响其它感觉系统的组织和机能，目前，关于某种感觉系统的损坏对其他感觉系统功能的影响有两种基本假设：缺陷假设（deficiency hypothesis）和补偿假设（compensation hypothesis）。 那么，对于听力障碍个体，由于听觉障碍，会对视觉注意造成什么影响呢？这就是本研究旨在系统考察的问题。 本研究选取非言语智力正常的听力障碍（hearing impaired）和听力正常（hearing）学生作为被试，研究一和研究二考察了 7 岁到成人期听力障碍群体和听力正常群体的持续注意和选择性注意发展，围绕听力障碍群体的视觉注意发展、缺陷假设和补偿假设对结果展开讨论；研究三和研究四根据研究一、二获得的结果，分别考察了在视觉注意技能受损阶段和补偿阶段被试的视觉注意空间分配和视觉注意控制。获得以下主要结论： （ 1 ）听力障碍群体和听力正常群体的持续视觉注意发展趋势一致：童年中期儿童的持续注意随龄逐渐提高，青少年期达到最好；听力障碍群体的持续注意技能与听力正常群体没有显著差异，但是前者表现出随着时间的过去，依然能够很好地将注意维持在当前任务中。 （ 2 ）听力障碍群体和听力正常群体的视觉注意能力发展有很大的差异：在童年中期，听力障碍儿童的视觉注意技能发展速度慢于听力正常儿童；年龄较大的童年中期听力障碍儿童的选择性视觉注意技能要差于相应的听力正常儿童，但是随着年龄的增长而慢慢地得到补偿，且到成人期，听力障碍成人的选择性视觉技能要稍优于听力正常成人。 （ 3 ）听力障碍和听力正常的童年中期儿童和青少年在视觉注意空间分配上相似。在低负载的情况下，两者都表现出受到中心分心物的更大干扰；而在高负载的情况下，只有听力障碍成人对边缘视觉处的分心物进行更多的加工，也即将更多的注意资源分配到视野的边缘。 （ 4 ）听力障碍被试和听力正常被试表现出相似的加工模式，即对单一的颜色特征目标的搜索表现出平行加工，而对方向、颜色方向的混合特征目标的搜索表现出系列加工；并且两组被试在注意控制方面的表现也一样。 综上所述，听觉通道信息的输入是儿童早期视觉注意发展的一个重要条件。因为不同感觉通道相互作用，在一个感觉通道的损害初期可能对其他感觉通道产生不良影响，但是正是由于一个感觉通道受损而使其他感觉通道的使用增加，从而使其他感觉通道的功能在随后得到提高...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVOS: identificar a incidência de recém-nascidos com deficiência auditiva, em maternidade {{particular}} da cidade de São Paulo. MÉTODOS: estudo de coorte transversal, realizado no período de 2004 a 2008, em maternidade localizada na zona sul da cidade de São Paulo, com 20. 615 recém-nascidos de ambos os sexos, sem indicadores de risco para deficiência auditiva e submetidos à triagem auditiva neonatal. O teste foi realizado por intermédio das Emissões Otoacústicas Evocadas Transientes (EOAET). Os pacientes que falharam nas EOAET nas duas fases foram encaminhados para a realização do Potencial Evocado Auditivo do Tronco Encefálico (PEATE) para a confirmação da deficiência auditiva neonatal. Empregou-se o Teste Exato de Fischer e o nível de significância adotado foi de 0, 05 oup OBJECTIVES: {{to determine}} the incidence of hearing impairment in newborns, at a private maternity hospital {{in the city of}} São Paulo. METHODS: a cross-sectional cohort study was carried out covering the period between 2004 and 2008, at a maternity hospital located in the southern zone of the city of São Paulo, including 20, 615 newborns of both sexes, with no risk factors for hearing impairment and who had undergone neonatal auditory screening. The test was carried out using the Evoked Transient Otoacoustic Emissions test. Patients who failed both phases of this test were referred to do a Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potential test to confirm the presence of neonatal <b>auditory</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Fischer 's exact test was used with a level of significance of 0. 05 orp< 0. 05. RESULTS: the incidence of neonatal hearing impairment found in this study was 1. 2 / 1000. CONCLUSION: state legislation allows neonatal auditory screening to be more effective in achieving early detection of neonatal hearing impairment. Neonatal auditory screening prevents future impairment of oral development and language acquisition in a social, professional and educational context...|$|E
40|$|A case {{of brain}} abscess and {{meningitis}} due to pigmented fungi is reported. The patient was a 59 -year-old white male, who had enjoyed excellent health until October 1977, when he developed headache, later accompanied by paresthesias and {{weakness in the}} left-sided extremities. These symptoms worsened progressively and in November of that year he had to quit his job. From February 1978 on he became inactive and anorexic. Intense continuous headache was associated with frequent episodes of vomiting. He gradually became tor-porous, and according to his relatives, suffered from visual and possibly <b>auditory</b> <b>deficiency.</b> On examination, he was malnourished and dehydrated, with decubitus ulcers. Temperature was 38, 5 °C. A left-sided spastic hemiplegia and prominent meningorradicular signs were noted. The CSF was examined six times between May 17 th and June 1 st and showed variable hypercytosis (143 to 4, 437 leucocytes/ cu mm) with predominance of neutrophils (up tp 95 %), low glucose and high protein concentrations. No microorganisms were identified. Electroencephalographic study disclosed a low background activity especially in left temporal areas. Despite supportive care and antibiotic therapy he lapsed into coma. Carotid angiography was normal on June 1 st. He remained in deep coma until his death on June 6 th, 1978. Necropsy {{was limited to the}} brain, which weighed 1, 550 g after fixation and showed diffuse intense edema and hyperemia. On coronal sectioning an encapsulated abscess was found in the right basal ganglia, which also involved the internal capsule, and measured 1. 5 cm in diameter. Microscopical examination disclosed large numbers of brownish fungi, appearing both as oval yeasts and as septate hyphae in the thick fibrous capsule and in the necrotic content of the abscess. The same organisms were demonstrated in moderate numbers in the leptomeninges of the medulla oblongata and, less frequently, of the hippo-campal region and cerebellum. As lesões cerebrais por fungos pigmentados são excepcionais. Os autores apresentam um caso de cromomicose do sistema nervoso central, em paciente de 59 anos. O quadro clínico iniciou-se por cefaléias e hemiparesia esquerda, seguida por meningite e síndrome de hipertensão intracraniana, totalizando uma evolução de nove meses. A neerópsia revelou abcesso encapsulado nos núcleos basais à direita e leptomeningite crônica de predomínio na base do encéfalo. Em ambas as localizações foram demonstrados numerosos fungos de cor castanha, em forma arredondada ou em hifas septadas. Discutem-se as dificuldades diagnosticas desta neuromicose...|$|E
40|$|The film {{industry}} has evolved tremendously {{in recent years}} and nowadays everyone can have access to audiovisual products. The arrival of digital television made possible a greater accessibility for the deaf and hard-of-hearing thanks to the inclusion of subtitles in many programmes from many channels. Nevertheless, in spite of this evolution, there is still something that is eluded: in general, the subtitles usually do not correspond to the needs of each and every type of audience. The audience concerned in this research is profoundly deaf children and the object of study is subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing (SDH). My hypothesis is that, taking into account the problems faced by deaf children during childhood when learning to read, subtitles in children’s films can be reduced and simplified in terms of grammar and complexity of sentences and words, with little change of the overall meaning of utterances. The objective {{of this paper is to}} try to simplify subtitles as much and accurately as possible so that profoundly deaf children would find subtitles easier to read, the film easier to watch, the plot easier to follow, and it would be a good method to improve their reading skills with entertaining materials. Traditionally, subtitling for the deaf have not been considered a completely translational process but we have to take into account that those subtitles are for people who have another mode of communication and, therefore, subtitles must convey the meaning of what is being said and fulfill a communicative aim. For the purpose of this study, translation will be seen as a branch of applied linguistics since the aim is to reduce and simplify sentences which might be difficult to process for deaf children rather than to translate from one language to another. Something that is not taken into consideration when making SDH is the heterogeneity of the deaf community. And especially when it comes to children, the process of learning to read is quite different from that of their hearing peers. Therefore subtitles should be written according to certain linguistic features and their cognitive processes. Nevertheless, the simplification of subtitles does not imply the idea of deaf children as virtually unable readers but as people who have an <b>auditory</b> <b>deficiency</b> that involves problems in the reading learning process. Besides, the reduction and simplification of subtitles does not mean either to slow down the learning process since deaf children do not get standard levels of literacy until adolescence or adulthood. In many countries, deaf children do not have access to especial schools for the deaf, which forces them to learn as a hearing peer. This is one of the reasons why deaf children encounter more difficulties when learning to read. An impairment such as deafness should not be an obstacle to learning and entertainment. The reduction and simplification of subtitles could be used as a method to motivate deaf children to learn to read and as a method to improve their reading skills. With regards to the structure, this research is divided into three main blocks: the theoretical background, the methodology followed and the analysis of data. The first block consists of an approach to three main areas of study: Audiovisual Translation and Subtitling, Psychology, and Linguistics. There is a review of the audiovisual medium (De Linde and Kay, 1999, Karamitroglou, 2000) and its constraints, as well as an account for some concepts which are essential for the purpose of this research, such as Toury's notion of norms (1995), Nida and Taber's dynamic equivalence (1969), Williams and Sperber's Theory of Relevance (1986 / 1995) and transfer of language. A classification of subtitles is given (Díaz Cintas and Remael, 2007; Neves, 2005) and the conventions of subtitling for deaf audiences, in particular deaf children, are presented. Then, an explanation of the problems faced by deaf learners is given, in which issues such as cognitive processes, mode of communication and decoding strategies used by deaf people are dealt with. For this section, research conducted on the matter was revised, such as that of Herrera (2009), De Linde and Kay (1999) and Peterson and Siegal (1999). Finally, some linguistic concepts are considered in relation to the objective of this research, such as cohesion and language style (Halliday, 1985, 2004). The second block provides an explanation of the methodology followed and the elaboration of two corpora, which give way to quantitative and qualitative analyses, and to the posterior reduction and simplification of part of the subtitles of two films for children, Aladdin and Up. The third block consists of the analysis of the data gathered through the elaboration of two corpora. The focus was put on the process of transadaptation that was carried out by reducing and simplifying the version of SDH offered in two Disney films. Due to the length of the analyses, part of them were added to the Appendix section (page 81). Then, the results of the analyses are presented and discussed, allowing to draw some conclusions. The SDH offered in audiovisual products is inappropriate in terms of number of words per minute and time rates subtitles remain on screen. A linguistic reduction and simplification of subtitles for deaf children is necessary so that accessibility is granted. In the conclusions, a proposal for the improvement of subtitling for the deaf and hard-of-hearing is provided, as well as a prospectus for further research...|$|E
