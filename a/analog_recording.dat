500|$|During the Title TK sessions, Kim Deal {{adopted a}} {{philosophy}} she calls [...] "All Wave". This approach stipulates that only <b>analog</b> <b>recording</b> may be used, without computer editing. Deal {{has said that}} she likes [...] "interesting mistakes" [...] in song production, and that her beliefs about recording are [...] "a reaction... to everything sounding so straight and clean in most records today". The album's mastering was also done using analog processes, by Albini and Steve Rook, at Abbey Road Studios in London.|$|E
500|$|The first CD {{copies of}} the album contain a small section of the {{original}} analogue master tape. Grohl decided to it both for thinking it [...] "would be an extraordinary move to destroy all the masters and give {{the pieces of the}} tapes to the fans", as the digital recording does not allow for such a memento, and also due to every technician involved with Wasting Light being overtly worried about the tapes. The art direction was done by New York studio Morning Breath Inc., and keeping with the album's <b>analog</b> <b>recording,</b> the images did not use computer graphics, instead being created with [...] "old tools of the trade" [...] such as copy machines, transparent ink and X-Acto blades, and the end result was not printed in CMYK.|$|E
500|$|West {{was criticized}} by the UK and US Parkinson's Disease Associations for {{controversial}} lyrics in lead-song [...] "On Sight". In February 2014, English singer Lily Allen announced that she would title her third studio album Sheezus. In an interview with Australian radio station Nova, Allen stated that she is terrified that West would think it's [...] "a diss rather than a tribute." [...] She said that she thinks West is brilliant and praised him for speaking his mind all the time. Jack White, a vocal advocate of <b>analog</b> <b>recording,</b> remarked that the album [...] "is obviously recorded on Pro Tools but sounds unbelievable, because it is very simple and there aren't a lot of components going on, and this really allows the songs to shine. Plus he mixed using analogue components." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{score for}} Legend of Mana was composed, arranged, and produced by Yoko Shimomura. Shimomura was {{a newcomer to}} the series; the previous two Mana games were scored by Hiroki Kikuta, and the first by Kenji Ito. Shimomura said in 2002 that she considered the soundtrack to Legend of Mana {{to be the one}} that best expresses herself. She claims that she prefers [...] "passionate music that comes from the heart", and that she has to [...] "feel the emotions of a piece in the extreme before I am able to write" [...] the music by putting herself in the same mood as the piece is supposed to be in. Legend of Mana featured the first vocal track of any Mana game, [...] "Song of Mana", which also serves as the game's opening theme. It was sung by Swedish vocalist Annika Ljungberg, who was chosen by Shimomura because she [...] "wanted to stay away from working with someone popular that everyone already knows". After hearing a sample of Ljungberg's music, she flew to Sweden [...] "straight away" [...] to do an <b>analog</b> <b>recording</b> of the song.|$|E
500|$|Legend of Mana, {{released}} for the PlayStation in 1999, features music {{composed by}} Yoko Shimomura. She had previously composed for several Square games including Live A Live and Parasite Eve and had originally joined Square {{for the purpose}} of composing music for fantasy role-playing games. She was initially hesitant to compose for the Mana series, as she felt that it was so associated with the music of Ito and Kikuta. In 2002, Shimomura said that of all her compositions to date, she considered the soundtrack to Legend the one that best expresses herself. Shimomura claims that she prefers [...] "passionate music that comes from the heart", and that she has to [...] "feel the emotions of a piece in the extreme before I am able to write" [...] the music by putting herself in the same mood as the piece is supposed to be in.

After hearing a sample of Annika's music, she flew to Sweden [...] "straight away" [...] to do an <b>analog</b> <b>recording</b> of the song. Four of the game's tracks were released as part of , an arranged album highlighting the composer's work: [...] "Legend of MANA ~Title Theme~", [...] "Hometown Domina", [...] "Colored Earth", and [...] "Bejeweled City Ruined". Shimomura carefully chose the songs to be included on the album based on their apparent popularity among fans and how suitable they are for orchestra. In addition to the soundtrack album, a promotional album of music from Legend of Mana was produced and was included with preorders of the game in North America.|$|E

2500|$|Sound {{recording}} {{and reproduction is}} an electrical or mechanical inscription and re-creation of sound waves, such as spoken voice, singing, instrumental music, or sound effects. The two main classes of sound recording technology are <b>analog</b> <b>recording</b> and digital recording. Analog (or analogue) recording (Greek, ana = [...] "according to" [...] and logos = [...] "relationship") is a technique used to store signals of audio or video information for later playback. In digital recording, the analog signal of video or sound is converted into a stream of discrete numbers, representing the changes in chroma and luminance values (video) orair-pressure (audio) through time, thus making an abstract template for the original sound or moving image. In 1967, the first digital audio magnetic tape recorder is invented. A 12-bit 30kHz stereo device using a compander to extend the dynamic range.|$|E

2500|$|Since CDs {{were not}} the primary medium for popular music until the late 1980s, there was little {{motivation}} for competitive loudness practices then. The common practice of mastering music for CD involved matching the highest peak of a recording at, or close to, digital full scale, and referring to digital levels {{along the lines of}} more familiar analog VU meters. When using VU meters, a certain point (usually −14dB below the disc's maximum amplitude) was used {{in the same way as}} the saturation point (signified as 0dB) of <b>analog</b> <b>recording,</b> with several dB of the CD's recording level reserved for amplitude exceeding the saturation point (often referred to as the [...] "red zone", signified by a red bar in the meter display), because digital media cannot exceed 0decibels relative to full scale (dBFS). The average level of the average rock song during most of the decade was around −16.8dBFS.|$|E
2500|$|Absolute pitch (AP) is {{the ability}} to produce or {{recognize}} specific pitches without reference to an external standard. People boasting AP have internalized pitch references, and thus are able to maintain stable representations of pitch in long-term memory. AP is regarded as a rare and somewhat mysterious ability, occurring in as few as 1 in 10,000 people. A method commonly used to test for AP is as follows: subjects are first asked to close their eyes and imagine that a specific song is playing in their heads. Encouraged to start anywhere in the tune they like, subjects are then instructed to try to reproduce the tones of that song by singing, humming, or whistling. Productions made by the subject are then recorded on digital audio tape, which accurately preserves the pitches they sing avoiding the potential pitch and speed fluctuations of <b>analog</b> <b>recording.</b> Lastly, the subjects' productions are compared to the actual tones sung by the artists on the CDs. Errors are measured in semitone deviations from the correct pitch. This test, however, does not determine whether or not the subject has true absolute pitch, but rather is a test of implicit absolute pitch. Where true absolute pitch is concerned, Deutsch and colleagues have shown that music conservatory students who are speakers of tone languages [...] have a far higher prevalence of absolute pitch than do speakers of nontone languages such as English. For a test of absolute pitch see the [...] developed by Deutsch and colleagues at the University of California San Diego.|$|E
