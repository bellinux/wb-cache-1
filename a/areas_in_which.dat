5|$|In the <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it was endemic, the emu was an {{important}} source of meat to Aboriginal Australians. They used the fat as bush medicine and rubbed it into their skin. It served as a valuable lubricant, was used to oil wooden tools and utensils such as the coolamon, and was mixed with ochre to make the traditional paint for ceremonial body adornment.|$|E
5|$|Infections {{are most}} {{commonly}} {{acquired in the}} urban environment. In recent decades, the expansion of villages, towns and cities in the <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it is common, and the increased mobility of people has {{increased the number of}} epidemics and circulating viruses. Dengue fever, which was once confined to Southeast Asia, has now spread to Southern China, countries in the Pacific Ocean and America, and might pose a threat to Europe.|$|E

5|$|Process {{philosophy}} {{is even more}} difficult to pin down than process theology. In practice, the two fields cannot be neatly separated. The 32-volume State University of New York series in constructive postmodern thought edited by process philosopher and theologian David Ray Griffin displays the range of <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> different process philosophers work, including physics, ecology, medicine, public policy, nonviolence, politics, and psychology.|$|E

Additionally, there seems to be little habitat destruction in Gabon and on Bioko as the locations in these places in which the rockfowl lives is believed to be too inaccessible for future human development. Recent surveys have also discovered new populations of the grey-necked rockfowl.|$|E

5|$|After {{five years}} of war and heavy {{attrition}} many of the Luftwaffe's pilots were inexperienced fledgelings and poorly trained, deficient in marksmanship and flight skills. There was a shortage of experienced instructors, {{and many of the}} training units were forced to fly front-line operations in order to bolster the front-line Jagdgeschwader. Long-range Allied fighters exacerbated this situation by shooting down many training aircraft. By late 1944 there were no safe <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> pilots could be trained without the possibility of air attack. Allied personnel who witnessed the attacks frequently remarked on the poor aim of the strafing aircraft, and many of the Luftwaffe aircraft shot down by Allied anti-aircraft fire were caught because they were flying too slowly and too high. Aviation fuel supplies were also at a premium.|$|E
5|$|Day 4–8 outlooks are the longest-term {{official}} SPC Forecast Product, {{and often}} change significantly {{from day to}} day. This extended forecast for severe weather was an experimental product until March 22, 2007, when the Storm Prediction Center incorporated it as an official product. Areas are delineated in this forecast that have least a 15% or 30% chance of severe weather in the Day 4–8 period (equivalent to a slight risk and an enhanced risk, respectively); as forecaster confidence is not fully resolute on how severe weather will evolve more than three days out, the Day 4–8 outlook only outlines the <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> severe thunderstorms are forecast to occur during the period at the 15% and 30% likelihood, and does not utilize other categorical risk areas or outline where general (non-severe) thunderstorm activity will occur.|$|E
5|$|Deforestation {{has also}} caused {{population}} declines for the vulnerable Yunnan and yellow-billed nuthatches. The Yunnan nuthatch can cope with some tree loss, since it prefers open pine woodland, but although still locally common, it has disappeared from {{several of the}} <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it was recorded in the early 20th century. The threat to yellow-billed is particularly acute on Hainan, where more than 70% of the woodland has {{been lost in the}} past 50 years due to shifting cultivation and the use of wood for fuel during Chinese government re-settlement programmes.|$|E

50|$|A liberty was an English unit {{originating}} in the Middle Ages, traditionally defined as an <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> regalian right was revoked and where the land was held by a mesne lord (i.e., an <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> rights reserved to the king had been devolved into private hands). It later became a unit of local government administration.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the thought}} that {{increasing}} availability to emergency medicine will improve patient outcomes, little empirical evidence exists to directly support that claim, even in developed countries. Between 1985 and 1998 only 54 randomized controlled trials related to emergency medical services were published, implying {{that much of the}} current standard of care rests upon meager support. A similar lack of direct proof exists for the effectiveness of international assistance in promoting emergency medicine in other countries. Although it may seem that such efforts must improve health, the failure to quantify international emergency medicine's impact renders it more difficult to identify the best practices and target <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the most benefit may be achieved.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, {{as the price}} of silver rose, Treasury Department vaults were {{depleted}} of silver dollars by the public. No silver dollars had been minted in the United States since 1935, and a shortage developed in the Western United States, especially in <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> gambling was common. As a result, Congress voted to authorize production of 45 million new silver Peace dollars on August 3, 1964. However, the move drew strong condemnation from critics who believed that the issuance of the coins was influenced by special interests, and that they would be quickly removed from circulation. The dollars were subsequently melted, and the Coinage Act of 1965, enacted on July 23, 1965, forbade all production of dollar coins for a period of five years.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius blennius is {{very common}} and is found in {{broad-leaved}} woodland, favouring beech; it is most associated with Fagus sylvatica, the European Beech, though {{it has also been}} observed growing in association with species of oak. It forms an ectomycorrhizal association with trees, and can grow {{on a wide variety of}} subsoil types, but is more typical of acidic soil. It is found between late summer and late autumn, and is native to Europe. The distribution of the mushroom coincides with the distribution of beech. In the British Isles, the species is one of the one hundred most common mushrooms. Other <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it has been recorded include Sweden, France, Italy, and Poland.|$|E

5|$|Pokémon Red and Blue {{take place}} in the region of Kanto. This is one {{distinct}} region shown in later games, with different geographical habitats for the 151 existing Pokémon species, along with human-populated towns and cities, and Routes connecting locations with one another. Some areas are only accessible once the player learns a special ability or gains a special item. <b>Areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the player can catch Pokémon range from caves to the sea, where the kinds of Pokémon available to catch varies. For example, Tentacool can only be caught either through fishing or when the player is in a body of water, while Zubat can only be caught in a cave.|$|E
5|$|Some {{plants and}} animals are generalists, and their habitat {{requirements}} are met {{in a wide range}} of locations. The small white butterfly (Pieris rapae) for example is found on all the continents of the world apart from Antarctica. Its larvae feed on a wide range of Brassicas and various other plant species, and it thrives in any open location with diverse plant associations. The large blue butterfly is much more specific in its requirements; it is found only in chalk grassland areas, its larvae feed on Thymus species and because of complex lifecycle requirements it inhabits only <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Myrmica ants live.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the Caribbean reef shark as Near Threatened; its population has declined off Belize and Cuba from overfishing and exploitation continues in other regions. They are also {{threatened by the}} degradation and destruction of their coral reef habitat. Commercial fishing for this species is prohibited in United States waters. They are protected in the Bahamas due to their significance to ecotourism, {{as well as in}} a number of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) off Brazil and elsewhere. However, enforcement against illegal fishing is lacking in some of these reserves, and many <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> this species is abundant are not protected.|$|E

5|$|The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism was Weber's {{second major}} {{work on the}} {{sociology}} of religion. Hans H. Gerth edited and translated this text into English, with an introduction by C. K. Wang. Weber focused on those aspects of Chinese society that were {{different from those of}} Western Europe, especially those aspects that contrasted with Puritanism. His work also questioned why capitalism did not develop in China. He focused on the issues of Chinese urban development, Chinese patrimonialism and officialdom and Chinese religion and philosophy (primarily, Confucianism and Taoism), as the <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Chinese development differed most distinctively from the European route.|$|E
5|$|The {{curriculum}} {{is designed to}} prepare students for professional careers in the arts. Each student concentrates in at least one major area: creative writing, dance, drama, music, stagecraft, and visual art. Younger students often concentrate in two or more. High school students are required to specialize and major only in the <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they have potential to do professional work. Advanced students study up to two hours each day in their major. Forty percent of the students stay at least two hours after school for rehearsals, private lessons, and productions.|$|E
5|$|The large Goodyear fan-belt factory at Silverwood Industrial Estate was {{a product}} of the Craigavon {{development}} when large tracts of land in Lurgan, Portadown, and areas in between were zoned off for exclusive industrial use. The Goodyear factory closed in 1983 after failing to make a profit, resulting in the loss of 750 jobs. The facility was later partly occupied by Wilson Double Deck Trailers and DDL Electronics. Silverwood Industrial Estate continues to host other manufacturing and light engineering firms.
