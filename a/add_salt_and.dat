40|$|This is a {{guide to}} the growing, {{harvesting}} and use of spinach and swiss chard. Spinach Spinach is a cool season crop and belongs to the goosefoot family (Chenopodiaceae), along with Swiss chard and beets. Spinach is low in calories. It is a good source of vitamin C, vitamin A, and minerals, especially iron. After washing the leaves, cook them in a covered pan using only the water clinging to the leaves. After cooking, <b>add</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> butter, vinegar, or mustard for added flavor. Spinach may be prepared in a souffle, creamed soup, or used raw in salads. Swiss Chard Swiss chard is a type of beet that is grown for its large leaf stalks and leaves. It produces no enlarged fleshy roots. It is low in calories and minerals and a good source of vitamins A and C. Chard leaves are best prepared like spinach or beet greens - cooking with only the water that clings to them following washing. A bit of garlic or nutmeg and butter enhances the flavor of chard leaves. Chard stems have a delicate flavor much like asparagus and are prepared in a similar way. Stems should be stripped of leaves, cut into conveniently sized pieces, and gently steamed in salted water until tender. Cooked and chilled stems are very good with salad dressing or mayonnaise. Leaves and stems may also be cooked together...|$|E

40|$|A thermo-sensitive ionic block copolymer, PAMPTMA-b-PNIPAAM, made of poly (N-isopropylacrylamide), (PNIPAAM), and poly (3 -acrylamido propyltrimethyl-ammonium chloride) (PAMPTMA) parts was synthesized. Its {{solution}} properties {{were investigated}} by viscosity, DLS and ζ-potential measurements. In solution the block co-polymer undergoes thermal transitions above a critical temperature, CMT, and forms micelles. The transition {{depends on the}} amount of added NaCl. A comparison of the performances below and above the CMT was made and related to the medium ionic strength, i. e. to the residual charges on PAMPTMA domains. Progressive shifts of the CMT to lower values is ascribed to the reduced repulsions between positive charges of PAMPTMA moieties, induced by <b>added</b> <b>salt,</b> <b>and</b> to the subsequent decrease of the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), of the block co-polymer. The LCST regularly decrease on increasing the <b>added</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> can be properly modulated. The block-copolymer interacts electrostatically with oppositely charged poly-electrolytes. Preliminary studies indicate that, above the CMT, PNIPAAM/. PAMPTMA binds to DNA, with formation of micelle/.
