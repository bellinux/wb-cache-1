25|$|Arriving at Oxford {{just after}} the September 11 attacks, Clinton was drawn to other American {{students}} who were also feeling the emotional after-effects of the trauma. She told Talk magazine:Every day I encounter some sort of anti-American feeling. Over the summer, I thought I would seek out non-Americans as friends, just for diversity's sake. Now I find that I {{want to be around}} Americans – people who I know <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> our country as much as I am.|$|E
25|$|Violence against girls discourages {{them from}} {{attending}} school. Sexual or physical {{violence on the}} way to and from school or at home reduces girls' ability to concentrate in class. Instead of attending to the lesson, they <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the violence they have experienced or worrying about future violence to come. Abuse reduces girls' participation in class even further than normal and reduces their ability to complete homework. Abused girls {{are more likely to have}} low attainment, more grade repetition and a higher drop-out rate than non-abused girls.|$|E
500|$|In contrast, several {{parties have}} {{expressed}} concern that Doomsday presents negativity in England's latent view of Scotland based on their history. Angus MacNeil, member of the Scottish National Party, said of the film's impact: [...] "The complimentary part is that people <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> Scotland as we are moving more and more towards independence. But the film depicts {{a country that is}} still the plaything of London. It is decisions made in London that has led to it becoming a quarantine zone." ...|$|E

50|$|He {{encounters}} the man {{who told}} him of his wife's letter, and he thinks briefly about how he hates travelling through the cursed forest. Josh then sees the student, who <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> how her parents will hate her once they find out that she dropped out of school. When Josh sees the two ballerinas, they both <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> that without the other, they could be stars. Then he sees the four going to the rave. Aaron first thinks about how he doesn't like 'love and peace', Monica <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> how she loves Europe and how lovely Max <b>is,</b> Max <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> how to use Monica to smuggle drugs into America, and Katja is lamenting about how Monica is being used as Max's puppet. Josh then meets Jane, who <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> her next project, and how half- dead people can be used. She then snaps out of her dream, thinking that she might need counselling. Next, Josh sees the two Romanian generals. One <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> how he lost his friends in war because his gun jammed, the other <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> marrying the woman he loves and setting up his own business. The next man he sees is the ticket collector, who <b>is</b> strangely <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the train derailing. Unable to see Yeli, Josh then sees the German businessman, who wants to embezzle his company's funds. Lastly, he sees Kate. She <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> {{the fact that she}} is pregnant, a fact Josh didn't know. Viktor then appears by her side, saying that she is the same as his wife Mary. Kate then turns into gas, Viktor sees Josh, and he runs away.|$|R

2500|$|For three months, UN officials, the CDC, {{and others}} argued against {{investigating}} {{the source of}} the outbreak. Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the World Health Organization (WHO), said finding the cause of the outbreak was [...] "not important". [...] "Right now, there is no active investigation. I cannot say one way or another [...] It is not something we <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> at the moment. What we <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> is the public health response in Haiti." [...] Jordan Tappero, the lead epidemiologist at the CDC, said the main task was to control the outbreak, not to look for {{the source of the}} bacteria and that [...] "we may never know the actual origin of this cholera strain." [...] A CDC spokesperson, Kathryn Harben, added that [...] "at some point in the future, when many different analyses of the strain are complete, {{it may be possible to}} identify the origin of the strain causing the outbreak in Haiti." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since 25 August 2017, Bangladesh has {{received}} at least 480,000 refugees. This added to the 500,000 refugees from earlier crackdowns, including 66,000 who arrived after October 2016. The Parliament of Bangladesh adopted a unanimous resolution urging {{the international community to}} pressure Myanmar to provide citizenship and safe return for the Rohingya. Bangladeshi President of Bangladesh Abdul Hamid suggested that a United Nations-administered humanitarian corridor be established in Myanmar for the Rohingya. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said, [...] "They (Myanmar) should stop the violence. The Myanmar government should have handled this situation patiently and not allowed the army to attack the common people. What are the crimes of the women, children, the innocent people? They are not responsible". Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmud Ali said that Myanmar's actions were being described as genocide. National Human Rights Commission of Bangladesh chairman Kazi Reazul Hoque alluded to the prospect of international prosecution of Myanmar forces: [...] "The way the genocide has been carried out in Myanmar, the way the people were killed in arson attacks, we <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> pressing for a trial against Myanmar, and against the Myanmar army at an international tribunal". The Bangladeshi foreign ministry summoned the Myanmar envoy several times since the crisis began, protesting the refugee influx and alleged intrusions by Myanmar aircraft into Bangladeshi airspace. Major General Abul Hussain, a border force commander, promised a [...] "befitting reply" [...] to any [...] "untoward situation" [...] on the Bangladesh-Myanmar border.|$|E

2500|$|The analogy he {{provides}} {{to explain his}} theory is that of wood and fire. Wood, he argues, is potentially hot (just as a human <b>is</b> potentially <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> a universal), and therefore requires something else which is already hot (such as fire) to actualize this. This means that for the human intellect to think about something, the First Intellect must already <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it. Therefore, {{he says that the}} First Intellect must always <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> everything. Once the human intellect comprehends a universal by this process, it becomes part of the individual's [...] "acquired intellect" [...] and can be thought about whenever he or she wishes.|$|R
