500|$|No known {{fossils of}} cacti exist to throw light on their {{evolutionary}} history. However, the geographical distribution of cacti offers some evidence. Except {{for a relatively}} recent spread of Rhipsalis baccifera to parts of the Old World, cacti are plants of South America and mainly southern regions of North America. This suggests the family must have evolved after the ancient continent of Gondwana split into South America and Africa, which occurred during the Early Cretaceous, around [...] Precisely when after this split cacti evolved is less clear. Older sources suggest an early origin around 90 – 66 million years ago, during the Late Cretaceous. More recent molecular studies suggest a much younger origin, perhaps in very Late Eocene to early Oligocene periods, around 35–30million years ago. Based on the phylogeny of the cacti, the earliest diverging group (Pereskia clade A) may have originated in Central America and northern South America, whereas the caulocacti, those with more-or-less succulent stems, evolved later {{in the southern part}} of South America, and then moved northwards. Core cacti, those with strongly succulent stems, are estimated to have evolved around 25million years ago. [...] A possible stimulus to their evolution may have been uplifting in the central Andes, some 25–20million years ago, which was associated with increasing and varying aridity. However, the current species diversity of cacti is thought to have arisen only in the last 10–5million years (from the late Miocene into the Pliocene). Other succulent plants, such as the <b>Aizoaceae</b> in South Africa, the Didiereaceae in Madagascar and the genus Agave in the Americas, appear to have diversified at the same time, which coincided with a global expansion of arid environments.|$|E
