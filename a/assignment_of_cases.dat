To identify the sources of racial disparities, I construct a dataset linking judges to over 400, 000 defendants. Exploiting the random <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> to judges, I find that racial disparities are greater among judges appointed after Booker, suggesting acculturation to the Guidelines by judges with experience sentencing under a mandatory regime.

40|$|Criminal judges lack {{independence}} in Burundi. Most {{of the challenges}} they face are of a statutory nature and are therefore common to all judges, regardless their subject matter jurisdiction. The legal framework {{as well as the}} political culture makes the judiciary dependent upon the executive branch of government, almost entirely. Although the constitution provides for separation of powers and for independence of the Judiciary, judges are appointed, promoted and removed largely according to the will of the Executive. The Judiciary also lacks budgetary autonomy. Disciplinary sanctions against ârebelliousâ judges are also common. To worsen the situation, the constitutional body vested with the mission to protect and promote the independence of the Judiciary-the National Council of the Magistrature-is itself controlled and dominated by the Executive. There are also specific challenges to criminal judges. They are related to the involvement of criminal justice in the implementation of the National Security Policy, the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> and the abuse of pretrial detention. Discussing those issues, this lecture looks both at the legal obstacles to full and genuine independence of criminal judges {{as well as to the}} socio-political context in which criminal âjusticeâ is delivered.

40|$|The {{extent to}} which {{judicial}} outcomes depend on judges ’ identities is a central question in multiethnic societies. Past work {{on the impact of}} the racial composition of appellate courts has narrowly focused on civil rights cases in the United States. We expand this literature by testing for ethnicity-based panel effects in criminal appeals in Israel. Using randomness in the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> to panels, we find that appeal outcomes for Jewish defendants are independent of panels’ ethnic composition. By contrast, panel composition is highly consequential for Arab defendants, who receive more lenient punishments when their case is heard by a panel that includes at least one Arab judge, compared to all-Jewish panels. The magnitude of these effects is sizable: a 14 – 20 % reduction in incarceration and a 15 – 26 % reduction in prison sentencing. These findings contribute to recent debates on the relationship between descriptive representation and substantive outcomes in judicial bodies. Acentral challenge formultiethnic societies is howbest to manage the interests of diverse groups.

Results are ob-tained for both simultaneous and nonsimultaneous regions of signif-icance. THE Johnson-Neyman technique (J-N) is commonly used to ana-lyze data from studies on individual differences in research on Apti-tude-Treatment Interactions. We consider analyses of data obtained from two groups that are formed by random <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> to groups and then given alternative (educational) treatments.

Simultaneous regions are appropriate for making statements about the difference of the within-group regressions over the range of the predictor variables.

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{interobserver}} {{variation in the}} pathological classification of ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast using two recently proposed classification schemes. METHODS: 11 pathologists classified a set of 25 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ chosen to reflect a range of lesions, using the traditional architectural classification together with the modified cytonuclear grading scheme of Holland et al and the Van Nuys classification scheme. Participating pathologists received a standard tutorial, written information, and illustrative photomicrographs before their assessment of the cases. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement was poorest when using the architectural scheme (kappa = 0. 44), largely owing to variations in classifying lesions with a mixed component of patterns (kappa = 0. 13). Agreement was better using the modified cytonuclear grading scheme (kappa = 0. 57), with most consistency achieved using the Van Nuys scheme (kappa = 0. 66). Most discordant results using the later scheme were due to inconsistency in assessing {{the presence or absence}} of luminal necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Both the new classification schemes assessed in this study were an improvement over the traditional architectural classification system for ductal carcinoma in situ, and resulted in more reproducible pathological <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases.</b> The Van Nuys classification scheme is easy to apply, even to small areas of carcinoma, resulting in acceptable interobserver agreement between reporting pathologists.

40|$|This thesis investigates Case {{assignment}} and subject-verb agreement in Standard Arabic. 'It discusses the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> default, structural and inherent Case in Arabic {{and provides a}} new analysis of subject-verb agreement based on the Minimal Feature Syntax of Sigurosson (2004). The key assumption is that Case {{assignment and}} agreement relations are realised by unrelated tokens of Agree. The thesis is composed of six chapters. The first chapter comprises the introduction and presents a rationale for the topic chosen, an outline of the thesis and {{the sources of the}} data discussed in the following chapters. The second chapter presents the background of the thesis and falls into two main sections. The first section introduces the descriptive background discussing the permissible word orders in Arabic, the patterns of subject-verb agreement and the morphological realization <b>of</b> Gender, Number, <b>Case,</b> and Definiteness as well as the forms of personal and demonstrative pronouns. The second section presents the theoretical background and discusses the introduction of features in syntax and the syntactic operations, Merge and Agree. The third chapter investigates the syntax of the left periphery. In its first section, the chapter discusses CLLD topics in Arabic and their Case marking. The chapter argues that a CLLD topic can be assigned either structural accusative Case by a finite complementiser, or nominative Case by default in the absence <b>of</b> any overt <b>Case</b> assigner. It is also posited that the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> structural <b>Case</b> is limited to the highest topic in structures with multiple CLLD topics. The second section discusses fronted focus phrases and argues that the ban on fronted focus phrases as to not occur immediately after a finite complementiser can be accounted for in terms of the defective intervention effect of Chomsky (2000, 2001). In its third section, the chapter discusses double complementiser structures in Arabic and argues that ?inna can merge in the structure either as the head Force of ForceP or as the head Fin of FinP, an analysis which provides support for the CP-Split Hypothesis of Rizzi (1997) in general and the structure used in this chapter for analysing CLLD topics and fronted focus phrases in particular. The fourth chapter investigates subject-verb agreement and the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> structural nominative <b>Case</b> in Arabic. It argues that the patterns of subject-verb agreement available in Arabic can be accounted for by adopting a structure in which each agreement phi-feature projects its own maximal projection. The fact that a postverbal subject can raise to a preverbal position and consequently get assigned structural accusative Case by a complementiser is linked to the absence of the expletive grammatical subject in the specifier of T which renders T unable to assign its structural Case. This postulation embodies two key assumptions; the first is that the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> nominative <b>Case</b> is not a reflex of the valuation of the agreement features, and the second is that Burzio's (1986) generalisation can be extended from the functional head v to the functional head T. The fifth chapter discusses the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Case</b> in double object constructions. It is argued that the lexical head V assigns inherent accusative Case either to its direct object or its indirect object. This optional assignment is posited to determine which DP object serves as the subject of the corresponding passive. The sixth chapter is a conclusion presenting a summary of the main findings of this thesis and the scope of further research. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) {{has been}} {{suspected}} {{of carrying out}} a harmonising agenda over and beyond the conventional law-interpreting function of the judiciary. This study aims to investigate empirically two theories {{in relation to the}} development of EU copyright law: (i) that the Court has failed to develop a coherent copyright jurisprudence (lacking domain expertise, copyright specific reasoning, and predictability); (ii) that the Court has pursued an activist, harmonising agenda (resorting to teleological interpretation of European law rather than – less discretionary – semantic and systematic legal approaches). We have collected two data sets relating to all ECJ copyright and database cases up to Svensson (February 2014) : (1) Statistics about the allocation of cases to chambers, the composition of chambers, the Judge Rapporteur, and Advocate General (including coding of the professional background of the personnel); (2) Content analysis of argumentative patterns in the decisions themselves, using a qualitative coding technique. Studying the relationship between (1) and (2) allows us to identify links between certain Chambers/ Court members and legal approaches, over time, and by subject. These shed light on the internal workings of the court, and also enable us to explore theories about the nature of ECJ jurisprudence. The analysis shows that private law and in particular intellectual property law expertise is almost entirely missing from the Court. However, we find that the Court has developed a mechanism for enabling judicial learning through the systematic <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> to certain Judges and AGs. We also find that the Court has developed a “fair balance” topos linked to Judge Malenovský (rapporteur on 24 out of 40 copyright cases) that does not predict an agenda of upward harmonisation, with about half of judgments narrowing rather than widening the scope of copyright protection...|$|E
40|$|Alcohol use {{and abuse}} is a major social and {{economic}} problem in many societies. Carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) is a widely used and highly specific biochemical alcohol marker of prolonged alcohol abuse. Increased knowledge about the clinical characteristics of CDT may lead to better possibilities of employing CDT as a biochemical alcohol marker of risky and heavy alcohol consumption and thus creating better opportunities for prevention and intervention of alcohol dependence. The aim of this thesis was to contribute to this knowledge by investigating the properties of CDT in different populations and evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of different analytical methodologies for analysis of CDT. Serum samples (n= 1387) from subjects originating from five different countries were analyzed with a HPLC candidate reference method for CDT. In non-drinkers there were minimal differences in the serum transferrin glycoform pattern with respect to different ethnicity, gender, age and BMI. When evaluating disialotransferrin, the primary glycoform in CDT, {{with respect to the}} same categories, no clinically significant differences were detected. Furthermore the overall test accuracy for identification of heavy drinkers (> 210 g ethanol/week for men and > 140 g ethanol/week for women) showed no gender difference. Serum samples (n= 178) were analyzed from subjects with clinical or pharmacological factors previously reported to cause false-positive CDT levels. Only ~ 5 % showed a relative disialotransferrin level exceeding the upper limit for the reference interval, leading to a conclusion that earlier reports on reasons for false positive CDT values are linked with the methodology used rather than with true physiological influences. When compared with a HPLC candidate reference method, the Bio-Rad %CDT HPLC test and the CEofix CDT assay proved to be appropriate for confirmatory and routine %CDT testing, showing an overall good correlation and agreement. The HPLC candidate reference method could readily be used for preliminary diagnosis of CDG and for <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> to either CDG-I or CDG-II...|$|E
