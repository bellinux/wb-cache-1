40|$|Abstract: Prohibition of Ot (organotin) {{compounds}} {{was introduced}} in Japan in 1997 and worldwide from September 2008. This meant that the production of paints containing TBT compounds was stopped and alternatives to the available Ot <b>antifoulants</b> had to be developed. It has been claimed that the degradation by-products of these alternative <b>antifoulants</b> were less toxic than those of Ot compounds. Since {{the introduction of the}} alternative <b>antifoulants,</b> the accumulation of these compounds has been reported in many countries. However, the toxicity of these compounds was still largely unreported. In this research, the toxicity of the alternative Ot <b>antifoulants</b> TPBP (triphenylborane pyridine) and TPBOA (triphenylborane octadecylamine) and their degradation products on Crassostea gigas and Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus were tested. The results showed that toxic effects in Crassostea gigas was higher for each antifouling biocide than that in Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus. Also, while the toxicity of the Organoboron <b>antifoulants</b> and the Ots were the same, the formerâ€™s degradation products were much less harmful...|$|R

50|$|Control {{strategies}} include coating all surfaces with an <b>antifoulant</b> such as copper-based {{epoxy paint}} or hot-dip galvanizing. Periodic inspection and replacement of grates and screens also reduces the risk. Increasing {{the size of}} the sea chests by 20 to 30 percent may delay the onset of serious problems that could force an engine shutdown. Thermal treatment is a highly effective strategy for the control of zebra mussels (McMahon et al. 1995). Thermal treatment may include retrofitting a closed loop system to recirculate the heated water to the sea chest or the addition of a second sea chest system, allowing engine cooling water to be discharged through the idle sea chest. Recirculation of engine cooling water as a thermal control strategy has proved extremely effective in controlling zebra mussels (Palermo 1992, U.S. Coast Guard 1994).|$|E
40|$|Specialty {{chemical}} {{treatments and}} related services {{have been used}} for may years to enhance the efficiency of industrial processes. In particular, this paper relates to the use of proprietary antifoulants and associated technology to inhibit the formation of deposits on heat transfer equipment in industrial process streams. It also covers sophisticated monitoring techniques which are used to determine energy savings realized by an <b>antifoulant</b> program. Historically, <b>antifoulant</b> purchases were based upon faith and possible desperation where severe fouling resulted in production losses. Success was measured by the run length of heat transfer equipment between cleanings or by a subjective inspection report following and exchanger opening, i. e., 'looks better than it did two years ago. ' As a result, <b>antifoulant</b> programs were tried and abandoned with little or no proof of success or failure. In the 1980 's, however, two major changes have occurred which make process antifoulants a more attractive investment alternative. First, the justification for an <b>antifoulant</b> investment is more readily apparent than in past years. Now, in addition to production losses, energy conservation has become a primary motive for investing in fouling inhibition. During the 1980 's, the Hydrocarbon Processing Industry (PPI) felt a 20 -fold increase in fuel replacement costs, while process antifoulants increased in price by less than 1 / 4 of that rate. As a result, <b>antifoulant</b> programs which provided energy savings as a feature in the past are now implemented with energy savings as a primary benefit. Secondly, it is now possible to take the subjectivity out of process <b>antifoulant</b> performance. Heat transfer technology, instrumentation, and economic incentives have made it possible to quantitatively document {{the success or failure of}} an <b>antifoulant</b> program. In recent years, considerable emphasis has been placed upon the rating of heat transfer equipment to determine the cost of fouling caused by energy loss. Because of these efforts, a plant can now realize a return on investment in terms of dollars of fuel saved by a sophisticated <b>antifoulant</b> application...|$|E

The global ban of tributyltin (TBT) has been heralded as a major environmental success; however, substitute <b>antifoulants</b> may also pose risks to aquatic ecosystems.

40|$|Organisms {{differ in}} their {{sensitivity}} to toxicants, and each biocide will have its own efficacy profile. Whenever an <b>antifoulant</b> is used to affect organisms beyond its high-efficacy profile, an excess of biocides will be emitted to the environment. We propose an unprejudiced and rational design of efficacy-optimised combinations with minimum environmental risk. To control release of several antifoulants independently we use microcapsules bound to a polymer coating. The approach is based on three initial steps: Mixture toxicity concepts are used to predict efficacy of > 100 000 combinations of 2 - 8 antifoulants. Predictions are based on full concentration-efficacy relationships with regard to prevention of settling of fouling model organisms (e. g. periphyton, sea lettuce, barnacles, sea squirt, blue mussel). Based on the predictions we will identify a set of > 100 000 combinations that are efficacious to all model organisms, and define their mixture concentrations and mixture ratios. Risk ratios (e. g. PEC/ PNEC) for the individual antifoulants are then used as weighing factors to rank the combinations according to their estimated relative risk to the environment. This results {{in a set of}} promising <b>antifoulant</b> combinations defined by their constituents, mixture ratios and total concentrations in water. The release rate from each of the individual mixture components will be regulated by microcapsule numbers, chemical and physical properties, to deliver the expected combination at the surface of the ship hull. The flexibility of the paint formulation ãƒ»with one <b>antifoulant</b> only in each capsule ãƒ»suggests that the coating can easily be reformulated to adjust to more demanding conditions.

40|$|Scientific relevance: Natural Product <b>Antifoulants</b> (NPAs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} alternatives to the toxic and non-biodegradable antifouling agents such as TBT. Considering the wealth of potential marine biota such as sponges and octocorals in Indian waters, there is wide scope for isolation of NPAs. Successful formulation of NPAs-based antifouling coatings will certainly help mitigate the load of toxic agents being released into the marine environment. The total ban imposed on TBT based antifouling paints, since 2008, has triggered the search for Natural Product <b>Antifoulants</b> (NPAs) as a promising alternative for the development of environmentally benign coatings. In view of this, thirty six species of sponges collected from the Gulf of Mannar, India, were screened for their inhibitory effect on fouling bacterial strains and cyprids of Balanus amphitrite.

Periodic cleaning and temperature drop due to the fouling have resulted in productivity losses and increased energy consumption. A common approach to reduce cleaning downtime is the injection of effective antifoulants into crude oil stream.

The sponges Haliclona sp. 628 and sp. 1031 synthesize the tetracyclic alkaloid, haliclonacyclamine A (HA), and the long chain alkyl amino alcohol, halaminol A (LA), respectively. Despite structural differences, HA and LA have identical effects on phylogenetically disparate ascidian larvae, inducing rapid larval settlement but preventing subsequent metamorphosis at precisely the same stage. HA and LA also have similar effects on sponge, polychaete, gastropod and bryozoan larvae, inhibiting both settlement and metamorphosis. Despite having identical roles in preventing fouling and colonisation, HA and LA differentially affect the physiology of cultured HeLa human cells, indicating they have different molecular targets.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry were used for molecular identification. The antibacterial activity in the extracts {{was caused by a}} previously described poly-halogenated 2 -heptanone: 1, 1, 3, 3 -tetrabromo- 2 -heptanone. To further investigate the role of this compound as an ecologically relevant <b>antifoulant</b> against bacterial colonisation, we quantified it on the surface of B. hamifera specimens collected in the field. Levels of 1, 1, 3, 3 -tetrabromo- 2 -heptanone {{on the surface of the}} algae were on average 3. 6 Âµg cmâ€“ 2. Natural surface concentrations of this secondary metabolite were used to test for growth-inhibiting effects against 18 bacterial strains isolated from red algae co-occurring with B. hamifera. The test indicated a phylogenetic specificity of the metabolite, and gram-positive bacteria and flavobacteria proved to be particularly sensitive. In a further test, natural surface concentrations of 1, 1, 3, 3 -tetrabromo- 2 -heptanone were applied to artificial panels and incubated in the sea.

40|$|In {{archived}} {{samples from}} the German environmental specimen bank (ESB) organotin compounds including tributyltin (TBT) and triphenyltin (TPT) {{as well as their}} potential degradation products were quanti. ed. Muscles of bream (Abramis brama) sampled in the period 1993 - 2003 from the rivers Rhine, Elbe, Saale, Mulde, Saar, and from Lake Belau (period 1988 - 2003) were analyzed by gas chromatography/atomic emission detection-coupling after extraction and derivatization. TBT was detected in nearly all samples and a decrease in levels was observed at all sampling sites. At most sites, the reduction seemed to be a result of the ban on the use of TBTbased <b>antifoulants</b> for the application on small boats, which became e. ective in Germany in 1989. Highest TBT levels were found in fish from the Elbe near Blankenese (470 ng TBT cation per g fresh weight; in 1995) and lowest in bream from Lake Belau (- 1; in 2001 and 2003). Highest TPT levels (253 ng g - 1 in 1993) were also found in bream caught near Blankenese where the occurrence seemed to be correlated to the former use of TPT as co-toxicant in <b>antifoulants.</b> At other sites TPT levels seemed to be correlated to its use as fungicide (e. g. 9 Â± 2 ng g - 1 in bream from Lake Belau in 2001) ...|$|R
30|$|Since 2008, {{the most}} {{successful}} of the heavy-metal based <b>antifoulants,</b> tributyltin (TBT) [3], has been banned and research has since focused on alternative strategies to mitigate the undesired accumulation of biomass on vessels submerged in the marine environment. In order to develop environmentally benign coatings, {{a better understanding of}} the colonization mechanisms of the target organisms is required. Ideally, improved knowledge of surface cues that promote settlement of fouling species as well as investigation of surface cues that repel settlement will lead towards effective but environmentally inert antifouling materials. For most biofoulers it is not the macroscopically visible adult organism that is relevant in this context, but the colonization stage, which is responsible for initial surface attachment [4].|$|R
