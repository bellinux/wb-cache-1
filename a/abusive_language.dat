40|$|This study {{examines}} the Yoruba above from the satiric and literary prism {{both as an}} instrument of social reform and personal reprimand in an indigenous community. The discourse taps from the resources of literary studies to evaluate the poetic qualities inherent in the imaginative deployment of imageries and related literary devices that are built into abusive pieces among the Yoruba people. Samples of <b>abusive</b> <b>languages</b> are obtained from daily exchanges among the Yoruba people and the record of Foyanmu Ogundare (a Yoruba oral poet in Ogbomoso) whose works are replete with examples of such satire driven abusive pieces. The study concludes that Yoruba abuse is a veritable weapon of social reform whose quality is enhanced by the imaginative use of language which qualifies this art as a specialized kind of oral poetry...|$|R

25|$|Yellow and red {{cards are}} both used in futsal.

A player is shown the red card and sent off if they engage in serious foul play, violent conduct, spitting at another person, or denying the opposing team a goal by handling the ball (except the goalkeeper inside their penalty area). Also punishable with a red card is denying an opponent moving towards the player's goal a goalscoring opportunity by committing an offence punishable by a free kick or a penalty kick and using offensive, insulting or <b>abusive</b> <b>language</b> or gestures. A player who has been sent off must leave the vicinity of the field.

If a team with more players scores against a team with fewer players, another player can be added to the team with an inferior number of players.

40|$|These days, {{more and}} more social {{movements}} are focusing on changing the ways we speak. As {{a result of these}} movements, words that were once commonplace until quite recently are being pushed out of our language because of their power to hurt people. This tells us that political groups recognize the power of words to greatly damage us. In this paper, I explore Wittgenstein’s philosophy of language in order to shed light on how we can use language to insult each other. Both the early and the later Wittgenstein are able to account, in some respects, for how we understand insults. Insults rely first on there being a fact that someone can point out about us and second on an injurious normative judgment about these facts. By outlining Wittgenstein’s ideas in both Tractatus Logico-Philosoficus and Philosophical Investigations we are able to create an account of how we can understand these <b>abusive</b> uses of <b>language.</b> Additionally, we can use the later ideas of the Philosophical Investigations, especially his criticisms of his earlier work, to account for how these groups are able to change language and attempt to remove these <b>abusive</b> uses of <b>language...</b>|$|R
