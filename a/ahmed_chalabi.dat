5|$|The New York Times {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq. On May 26, 2004, {{a year after}} the war started, the newspaper asserted that some of its articles had not been as rigorous as they should have been, and were insufficiently qualified, frequently overly dependent upon information from Iraqi exiles desiring regime change. Reporter Judith Miller retired after criticisms that her reporting of the lead-up to the Iraq War was factually inaccurate and overly favorable to the Bush administration's position, for which The New York Times later apologized. One of Miller's prime sources was <b>Ahmed</b> <b>Chalabi,</b> an Iraqi expatriate who returned to Iraq after the U.S. invasion and held a number of governmental positions culminating in acting oil minister and deputy prime minister from May 2005 until May 2006.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the months}} of July and August, a series of skirmishes in and around Najaf culminated with the Imman Ali Mosque itself under siege, only to have a peace deal {{brokered}} by al-Sistani in late August. Al-Sadr then declared a national cease fire, and opened negotiations with the American and government forces. His militia was incorporated into the Iraqi security forces and al-Sadr is now a special envoy. This incident was the {{turning point in the}} failed American efforts to install <b>Ahmed</b> <b>Chalabi</b> as leader of the interim government. The CPA then put Iyad Allawi in power; ultimately he was only marginally more popular than Chalabi.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the years}} after the fatwa issued against Salman Rushdie in {{response}} to his novel The Satanic Verses, Hitchens became increasingly critical of what he called [...] "excuse making" [...] on the left. At the same time, he was attracted to the foreign policy ideas of some on the Republican-right that promoted pro-liberalism intervention, especially the neoconservative group that included Paul Wolfowitz. Around this time, he befriended the Iraqi dissident and businessman <b>Ahmed</b> <b>Chalabi.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On May 26, 2004, a {{week after}} the U.S. {{government}} apparently severed ties with <b>Ahmed</b> <b>Chalabi,</b> a Times editorial acknowledged that some of the paper's coverage {{in the run-up to the}} war had relied too heavily on Chalabi and other Iraqi exiles, who were bent on regime change. The editorial also expressed [...] "regret" [...] that [...] "information that was controversial [...] allowed to stand unchallenged." [...] However, the editorial explicitly rejected [...] "blame on individual reporters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Long criticised for {{the strong}} anti-Islamic bias in her writing, Miller became embroiled in {{controversy}} after her coverage of Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) program {{both before and}} after the 2003 invasion was discovered to have been based on the inaccurate information in the intelligence investigations, particularly those stories that were based on sourcing from the now-disgraced <b>Ahmed</b> <b>Chalabi.</b> The New York Times later determined that a number of stories she had written for the paper were inaccurate. According to commentator Ken Silverstein, Miller's Iraq reporting [...] "effectively ended her career as a respectable journalist". Miller acknowledged in The Wall Street Journal on April 4, 2015, that some of her Times coverage was inaccurate, although she had relied on sources she had used numerous times in the past, including those who supplied information for her reporting that had previously won a Pulitzer Prize. [...] She further stated that policymakers and intelligence analysts had relied on the same sources as hers, and that at the time there was broad consensus that Iraq had stockpiles of WMD. The book she published in 2015 was an attempt to convince people that reporting of the nature she had done was very difficult.|$|E
2500|$|Kampfner {{outlined}} Wolfowitz’s {{strategy for}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which [...] "envisaged the use of air support and the occupation of southern Iraq with ground troops, to install a new government run by <b>Ahmed</b> <b>Chalabi’s</b> Iraqi National Congress." [...] Wolfowitz believed that the operation would require minimal troop deployment, Hersh explains, because [...] "any show of force would immediately trigger a revolt against Saddam within Iraq, {{and that it would}} quickly expand." [...] The financial expenditure would be kept low, Kampfner observes, if [...] "under the plan American troops would seize the oil fields around Basra, in the South, and sell the oil to finance the opposition." ...|$|R
25|$|Mithal al-Alusi, {{a secular}} Muslim Iraqi lawmaker, who is openly pro-Israel, paid {{a heavy price}} for visiting Israel in September 2004, criticizing Hamas and Hezbollah as {{terrorist}} organizations, and advocating peace with the Jewish state. Upon his return to Iraq, the Sunni politician was immediately removed from <b>Ahmed</b> <b>Chalabi's</b> Iraqi National Congress Party (INC). In 2005, apparently as payback, a gunmen opened fire on Alusi's car just after it left his house, killing two of his sons, Ayman, 21, and Jamal, 30, while he escaped unharmed. According to Alusi, there is no Iraqi-Israeli problem, {{and the interests of}} the two countries are parallel; thus, he advocates strategic relations between Iraq and Israel against terrorism. Alusi returned to Israel for a second visit in September 2008. Upon his return to Iraq, he was stripped of parliamentary immunity so that he could face charges of traveling illicitly to Israel. Later that year, Iraq's Federal Supreme Court ruled in his favor, maintaining it was no longer a crime for Iraqis to travel to Israel.|$|R

5000|$|With {{information}} about the mobile labs the Bush administration then went and asked <b>Ahmed</b> <b>Chalabi's</b> Iraqi National Congress (INC) if they knew anything about this [...] "threat". The INC provided an Iraqi defector, Mohammad Harith, who claimed that while working for the Iraqi government he had purchased seven Renault refrigerated trucks to be converted into mobile biological weapons laboratories. [...] The INC used James Woolsey, {{former director of the}} CIA, to directly contact Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Linton Wells, of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), with info about Mohammad Harith's account to avoid any scrutiny by the CIA. [...] Harith's was met by a DIA debriefer who concluded that it [...] "seemed accurate, but much of it appeared embellished" [...] and he apparently [...] "had been coached on what information to provide." [...] However, the line about Harith being coached was removed and one that he passed a lie detector added and as such became official evidence of mobile bio-labs even being used by Bush in his January 2003 State of the Union message. [...] Later Mohammad Harith like curveball evidence was labeled with a fabricator notice.|$|R
