60|$|The {{speculation}} {{relative to}} {{the recovery of the}} holy sepulchre held but a temporary sway over the mind of Columbus. His thoughts soon returned, with renewed ardor, to their wonted channel. He became impatient of inaction, and soon conceived a leading object for another enterprise of discovery. The achievement of Vasco de Gama, of the long-attempted navigation to India by the Cape of Good Hope, was one of the signal events of the day. Pedro Alvarez Cabral, following in his track, had made a most successful voyage, and returned with his vessels laden with the precious commodities of the East. The riches of Calicut were now the theme of every tongue, and the splendid trade now opened in diamonds and precious stones from the mines of Hindostan; in pearls, gold, silver, amber, ivory, and porcelain; in silken stuffs, costly woods, gums, <b>aromatics,</b> <b>and</b> <b>spices</b> of all kinds. The discoveries of the savage regions of the New World, as yet, brought little revenue to Spain; but this route, suddenly opened to the luxurious countries of the East, was pouring immediate wealth into Portugal.|$|E

Our research was directed toward studying the rate of the distillation and yield of etheric oils from the wooded greenery of conifers (fir, spruce, pine juniper and Douglas fir) by using a new procedure. These conifers represent an important raw material basis in this area, which could be used for the industrial production of etheric oil for the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industry. Before distillation, the samples were treated with microwaves under laboratory conditions, and the influence of microwaves on the duration of the distillation and yield of etheric oil compared to steam distillation was analyzed. The results showed that less time was required to achieve the same yield during the distillation, if the samples were treated with microwaves, which can be a significant economic factor in the production of this etheric oil...|$|R

40|$|Olive oil {{flavouring}} with <b>aromatic</b> plants <b>and</b> <b>spices</b> is {{a traditional}} practice in Mediterranean gastronomy. The aim of this work was to compare the influence of two different flavouring techniques (infusion of spices into the oil vs. combined malaxation of olives paste <b>and</b> <b>spices)</b> on chemical <b>and</b> sensory quality of flavoured olive oil. In particular, oxidative and hydrolytic degradation (by routine and non-conventional analyses), phenolic profiles (by HPLC), volatile compounds (by SPME-GC/MS), antioxidant activity, and sensory properties (by a trained panel and by consumers) of the oils were evaluated. The obtained results evidenced that the malaxation method was more effective in extracting the phenolic compounds, with a significantly lower level of hydrolysis of secoiridoids. As a consequence, antioxidant activity was significantly lower in the oils obtained by infusion, which were characterized by a higher extent of the oxidative degradation. The volatile compounds were not significantly influenced by changing the flavouring method, apart for sulfur compounds that were more abundant in the oils obtained by the combined malaxation method. From a sensory point of view, more intense bitter and pungent tastes were perceived when the infusion method was adopted...|$|R

40|$|Background Non-alcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFLD) can be {{regarded}} as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome (MS), which has a high prevalence in Western-lifestyle countries. NAFLD can progress to more severe pathologies such as cirrhosis and fibrosis, thus worsening individuals’ life quality and increasing health costs. In the last decades, many efforts have been made {{in order to understand the}} molecular mechanisms of NAFLD and how to cure it. It has become clear that alimentary regimen is of primary importance for preventing/treating MS and NAFLD. Scope and approach Beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) on MS and NAFLD are now recognized and can be ascribed to low calories intake but also to abundance of anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds which are present in fruit and vegetables as well as in herbs <b>and</b> <b>spices</b> widely used to flavor traditional Mediterranean dishes. The aim of this review is to summarize briefly NAFLD molecular pathways and therapies, while focusing on the beneficial effects and mechanisms of action of the most used Mediterranean <b>aromatic</b> plants <b>and</b> <b>spices</b> (MAPS).
