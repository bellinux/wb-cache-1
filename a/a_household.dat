500|$|<b>A</b> <b>household's</b> {{effective}} {{tax rate}} on consumption would vary with the annual expenditures on taxable items and the fixed monthly tax rebate. The rebate would have the greatest effect at low spending levels, where they could lower <b>a</b> <b>household's</b> effective rate to zero or below. The lowest {{effective tax rate}} under the FairTax could be negative due to the rebate for households with annual spending amounts below poverty level spending for <b>a</b> specified <b>household</b> size. At higher spending levels, the rebate has less impact, and <b>a</b> <b>household's</b> effective tax rate would approach 23% of total spending. A person spending at the poverty level would have an effective tax rate of 0%, whereas someone spending at four times the poverty level would have an effective tax rate of 17.2%. Buying or otherwise receiving items and services not subject to federal taxation (such as a used home or car) can contribute towards a lower effective tax rate.

40|$|In 1998, {{public housing}} {{agencies}} (PHAs) were given considerable discretion to select tenants {{on the basis}} of local PHA preferences rather than on old federal preferences for households experiencing housing-related hardships. Many PHAs have adopted other categorical preferences. As a result, the demographic profile and household composition of public housing tenants have changed. These changes have important implications for the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP), because past research has found that household characteristics and location factors significantly affect <b>a</b> <b>household’s</b> length of stay in the program. The study described in this article uses administrative data to explore the factors associ-ated with <b>a</b> <b>household’s</b> length of stay in the HCVP.
