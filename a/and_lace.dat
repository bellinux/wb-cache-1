5|$|Symmetries are {{prominent}} in textile arts including quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery and weaving, {{where they may}} be purely decorative or may be marks of status. Rotational symmetry is found in circular structures such as domes; these are sometimes elaborately decorated with symmetric patterns inside and out, as at the 1619 Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque in Isfahan. Items of embroidery <b>and</b> <b>lace</b> work such as tablecloths and table mats, made using bobbins or by tatting, can have {{a wide variety of}} reflectional and rotational symmetries which are being explored mathematically.|$|E
5|$|The channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae) parasitizes pied currawong nests, laying eggs {{which are}} then raised by the unsuspecting foster parents. The eggs closely {{resemble}} those of the currawong hosts. Pied currawongs {{have been known to}} desert nests once cuckoos have visited, abandoning the existing currawong young, which die, and a channel-billed cuckoo has been recorded decapitating a currawong nestling. The brown goshawk (Accipiter fasciatus) <b>and</b> <b>lace</b> monitor (Varanus varius) have also been recorded taking nestlings.|$|E
5|$|As far as {{possible}} elderly inmates were expected to undertake {{the same kind of}} work as the younger men and women, although concessions were made to their relative frailty. They might alternatively be required to chop firewood, clean the wards, or carry out other domestic tasks. In 1882 Lady Brabazon, later the Countess of Meath, set up a project to provide alternative occupation for non-able-bodied inmates, known as the Brabazon scheme. Volunteers provided training in crafts such as knitting, embroidery <b>and</b> <b>lace</b> making, all costs initially being borne by Lady Brabazon herself. Although slow to take off, when workhouses discovered that the goods being produced were saleable and could make the enterprise self-financing, the scheme gradually spread across the country, and by 1897 there were more than 100 branches.|$|E

25|$|Women {{who attend}} the Wesleyan Methodist girls' school, Queen Sālote College, are taught several Western handicrafts, such as {{embroidery}} and crochet. They {{learn to make}} embroidered pillowcases and bed coverings or crocheted lace tablecloths, bedcovers, <b>and</b> <b>lace</b> trim. However, Western-style handicrafts such as these have not become widely popular outside the school setting. They require expensive imported materials {{that can only be}} purchased in major towns. Village women {{are much more likely to}} turn their efforts to weaving mats or beating barkcloth, which can be done with free local material.|$|E
25|$|Cavalier was not {{understood}} {{at the time}} as primarily a term describing a style of dress, but a whole political and social attitude. However, in modern times the word has become more particularly associated with the court fashions of the period, which included long flowing hair in ringlets, brightly coloured clothing with elaborate trimmings <b>and</b> <b>lace</b> collars and cuffs, and plumed hats. This contrasted with the dress of at least the most extreme Roundhead supporters of Parliament, with their preference for shorter hair and plainer dress, although neither side conformed to the stereotypical images entirely.|$|E
25|$|As {{in other}} works by Metzinger {{of the same}} period, there are {{elements}} to be found of the real world, e.g., lighting fixtures, flowers, feathers <b>and</b> <b>lace.</b> The rest of the canvas consists {{of a series of}} crescendos and diminuendos of greater or lesser abstraction, of convex and concave forms, of hyperbolic and spherical surfaces, that stem from the teachings of Georges Seurat and Paul Cézanne. The Divisionist brushwork, mosaic-like 'cubes', present in his Neo-Impressionst phase (circa 1903 through 1907) have returned giving texture and rhythm to vast areas of the canvas, visible both in the figures and background.|$|E

25|$|The {{ordinary}} Bohra {{is highly}} conscious of his identity, {{and this is}} especially demonstrated at religious and traditional occasions by the appearance and attire of the participants. Dawoodi Bohra men wear a traditional white three-piece outfit, plus a white and gold cap (called a topi), and women wear the rida, a distinctive form of the commonly known burqa which is distinguished from other forms of the veil due to it often being in color and decorated with patterns <b>and</b> <b>lace.</b> The rida's difference from the burqa, however, is significant beyond just the colour, pattern <b>and</b> <b>lace.</b> The rida does not call for covering of women's faces like the traditional veil. It has a flap called the 'pardi' that usually hangs on the back like {{the hood of a}} jacket but it is not used to conceal the face. This is representative of the Dawoodi Bohra community's values of equality and justice for women, which they believe, is a tenet of the Fatimid Imamate's evolved understanding of Islam and the true meaning of women's chastity in Islam. The Dawoodi Bohra community also do not prevent their women from coming to mosques, attending religious gatherings or going to places of pilgrimage. It is often regarded as the most peaceful sect of Islam and an example of true Sufism; it has been critically acclaimed on several occasions even by Western governments such as those of the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden and particularly the United States for its progressive outlook towards gender roles, adoption of technology, promotion of literature, crafts, business and secular values. However, the Dawoodi Bohras are highly single-minded about inter-caste or inter-faith marriage. They do not oppose it but do not encourage it either. If a Dawoodi Bohra member does marry into another caste or religion, he or she is usually advised to ask his or her spouse to convert to Islam and, specifically, into the community.|$|E
25|$|The first {{sewing machine}} emerged in 1790, and later, Josef Madersperger began {{developing}} his first sewing machine in 1807, presenting his first working machine in 1814. The {{introduction of the}} sewing machine sped up garment production. Meanwhile, advanced spinning, weaving and cotton-printing techniques developed in the 18th century had already brought detailed, washable fabrics. These durable and affordable fabrics became popular among the majority population. These techniques were further developed {{by the introduction of}} machines. Before, accessories like embroidery <b>and</b> <b>lace</b> were manufactured on a small and limited scale by skilled craftsmen and sold in their own shops; in 1804, a machine for embroidering was constructed by John Duncan, and people started producing these essential accessories in factories and dispatching the products to shops throughout the country. These technical developments in clothing production allowed a greater variety of styles; rapid changes in fashion also became possible.|$|E
25|$|Dancer in a café depicts strikingly fashionable {{women and}} men {{at the height of}} Parisian fashion in 1912. The dancer dressed in a directoire-style beaded and {{embroidered}} green silk velvet and chiffon caped evening gown embellished with celluloid sequins and gold trim, her hair coiffed in an elegant chignon, appears on a low stage or table performing for patrons or guests, all fashionably dressed and coiffed in silk and beaded net gowns, silver brocade <b>and</b> <b>lace</b> full-length gowns, ostrich-plumed hats, patterned suit, fedora and black tie. The artist depicts the figures and background as a series of subdivided facets and planes, presenting multiple aspects of the café scene simultaneously. This {{can be seen in the}} deliberate positioning of light, shadow, the nonconventional use of chiaroscuro, of form and color, and the way in which Metzinger assimilates the fusion of the background with the figures. The manifold surface has a complex geometry of reticulations with intricate series of (almost mathematical looking) black lines that appear in sections as underdrawing and in others as overdrawing.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the death}} of James I and the {{accession}} of Charles I, elaborately embroidered clothing faded from popularity under the dual influences of rising Puritanism and the new court's taste for French fashion with its lighter silks in solid colours accessorised with masses of linen <b>and</b> <b>lace.</b> [...] In this new climate, needlework was praised by moralists as an appropriate occupation for girls {{and women in the}} home, and domestic embroidery for household use flourished. [...] Embroidered pictures, mirror frames, workboxes, and other domestic objects of this era often depicted Biblical stories featuring characters dressed in the fashion of Charles and his queen Henrietta Maria, or after the Restoration, Charles II and Catherine of Braganza.|$|E
500|$|Swimwear of the 1940s, 50s {{and early}} 60s {{followed}} the silhouette mostly from early 1930s. Keeping {{in line with}} the ultra-feminine look dominated by Dior, it evolved into a dress with cinched waists and constructed bustlines, accessorized with earrings, bracelets, hats, scarves, sunglasses, hand bags and cover-ups. Many of these pre-bikinis had fancy names like Double Entendre, Honey Child (to maximize small bosoms), Shipshape (to minimize large bosoms), Diamond Lil (trimmed with rhinestones <b>and</b> <b>lace),</b> Swimming In Mink (trimmed with fur across the bodice) and Spearfisherman (heavy poplin with a rope belt for carrying a knife), Beau Catcher, Leading Lady, Pretty Foxy, Side Issue, Forecast, and Fabulous Fit.
