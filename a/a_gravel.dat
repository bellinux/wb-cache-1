5|$|The lower {{altitude}} {{site where}} D.regia is found is characterised by permanently damp soils consisting mostly of <b>a</b> <b>gravel</b> bench formed from a creek bed. The plants grow in a peaty quartzite sand, often with <b>a</b> <b>gravel</b> cover. Rhizomes of mature plants grow above ground and among associated grasses and sedges when gravel is absent and below ground {{when there is}} <b>a</b> <b>gravel</b> cover present. Associated vegetation included species of Leucadendron {{and members of the}} families Cyperaceae, Iridaceae, and Restionaceae. The habitat of D.regia depends on periodic fire sweeping through and keeping the larger plants from choking out D.regia. Frost occurs infrequently in the valley.|$|E
