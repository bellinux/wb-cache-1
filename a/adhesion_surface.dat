50|$|The {{intermolecular force}} is weaker than {{electrostatic}} charges. However, it still attracts microscopic-sized dust {{to the image}} sensor with infinitesimal force. While earthing (grounding) the camera can help reduce the problem of electrostatic dust it does not reduce intermolecular attraction. If, for example, flour were drizzled into the camera, it would still adhere {{to the surface of}} earthed metal. This kind of dust is attracted by intermolecular force. Liquid also adheres to the image sensor by intermolecular force and such molecules adhere strongly due to their ability to get closer to the <b>adhesion</b> <b>surface,</b> making it harder for dust reduction systems to remove these type of contaminants completely. In such instances, wiping the optical elements in front of the image sensor with cleaning fluid may be necessary.|$|E
50|$|Given these complications, it {{was decided}} to plan and realize a new instrument, the Feed-drum (Fig. 5), for the purpose of not only {{extending}} the acoustic possibilities, but also of permitting the ergonomic use of new executive techniques. In particular, the vibrational attitude was transformed by eliminating the lower skin, a decision which simplified the tuning of the instrument’s basic frequency (30 Hz) and reduced the excitation rise time in the upper modes. A synthetic membrane was applied with isotropic characteristics and high flexibility on which the previously described map was drawn, with colors that made the areas of performance more visible. The shell and the tensioning hoop were realized in steel and aluminium; in particular, the tensioning hoop was made stiffer while the height was reduced and the <b>adhesion</b> <b>surface</b> increased. The suspension system was realized {{in such a way as}} to separate the Feed-drum completely from the supporting structure on the ground; all the mechanical parts, which were in contact with one another, were separated by an intermediate layer of antivibrational material.|$|E

However, <b>adhesion</b> <b>surface</b> {{characters of the}} coating decreased with an increase in coating hydrophobicity.|$|E
40|$|Various {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} demonstrated to be operative in bacterial <b>adhesion</b> to <b>surfaces,</b> but whether bacterial <b>adhesion</b> to <b>surfaces</b> can ever be captured in one generally valid mechanism is open to question. Although many papers in the literature make an attempt to generalize their conclusions, the majority of studies of bacterial adhesion comprise only two or fewer strains. Here we demonstrate that three strains isolated from a medical environment have a decreasing affinity for substrata with increasing surface free energy, whereas three strains from a marine environment have an increasing affinity for substrata with increasing surface free energy. Furthermore, adhesion of the marine strains related positively with substratum elasticity, but such a relation was absent in the strains from the medical environment. This study {{makes it clear that}} strains isolated from a given niche, whether medical or marine, utilize different mechanisms in adherence, which hampers the development of a generalized theory for bacterial <b>adhesion</b> to <b>surfaces...</b>|$|R

40|$|The stick-to-slip {{transition}} of a fingertip {{in contact with}} a planar surface does not occur instantaneously. As the tangential load increases, portions of the skin adhere while others slip, giving rise to an evolution of the contact state, termed partial slip. We develop a quasi-static model that predicts that if the coefficient of kinetic friction {{is larger than the}} coefficient of static friction, then the stuck surface area diminishes as the tangential load increases until reaching a ‘minimal <b>adhesion</b> <b>surface</b> area ’ where it vanishes abruptly. This phenomenon was observed in recently measured finger-slip image data (André et al., 2011) that were processed by an optic flow detection algorithm. We examined the results of ten trials.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the tribo-electric charging and adhesion properties of a model drug, theophylline. Moreover, binary powder mixtures of theophylline with methylcellulose (MC) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), having different polymer to drug ratios, were formed in order to study the impact of polymer concentration, particle size, substitution ratio and molecular size on the tribo-electric charging and <b>surface</b> <b>adhesion</b> properties of the drug. Furthermore, the relationship between tribo-electric charging and <b>surface</b> <b>adhesion</b> was also studied. The diversity in physicochemical properties of MC/HPMC has shown a significant impact on the tribo-electric charging and adhesion behaviour of theophylline. It was found that the magnitude of electrostatic charge and the level of <b>surface</b> <b>adhesion</b> of the API were significantly reduced with an increase in MC and HPMC concentration, substitution ratios and molecular size.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{formation}} of adhesions following abdominal surgery {{is a well}} known problem. In previous studies we demonstrated the efficacy and safety of intraperitoneally applied phospholipids {{in order to prevent}} adhesion formation. This study evaluates the influence of blood on the efficacy of intraperitoneally applied phospholipids for prevention of adhesions. Methods In 40 Chinchilla rabbits adhesions were induced by median laparotomy, standardized abrasion of the visceral and parietal peritoneum in defined areas of the ventral abdominal wall and the caecum. The animals were randomly divided into four groups. They received either phospholipids 3. 0 % or normal saline (NaCl 0, 9 %) (5 ml/kg body weight). In 50 % of the rabbits we simulated intraperitoneal bleeding by administration of blood (1, 5 ml/kg body weight). The other half served as control group. Ten days following the operation the animals were sacrificed and adhesion formation was assessed by computer aided planimetry and histopathologic examination. Results The median <b>adhesion</b> <b>surface</b> area in the NaCl-group (n = 9) amounted to 68, 72 mm 2, in the NaCl+Blood-group (n = 10) 147, 68 mm 2. In the Phospholipid (PhL) -group (n = 9) the median <b>adhesion</b> <b>surface</b> area measured 9, 35 mm 2, in the PhL+Blood-group (n = 9) 11, 95 mm 2.

40|$|Ice {{adhesion}} {{is mainly}} dictated by surface properties, and water wettability is frequently correlated with ice adhesion strength. However, these established correlations {{are limited to}} high ice adhesion and become invalid when the ice adhesion strength is low. Here we carried out an experimental study to explore the relationships between low ice adhesion strength and room temperature surface properties. A variety of room temperature properties of 22 polymer-based hydrophilic and hydrophobic samples consisting of both low and high ice <b>adhesion</b> <b>surfaces</b> were analysed. The properties investigated include water adhesion force, water wettability, roughness, elastic modulus and hardness. Our results show that low ice adhesion strength does not correlate well with water contact angle and its variants, surface roughness and hardness. Low elastic modulus does not guarantee low ice <b>adhesion,</b> however, <b>surfaces</b> with low ice adhesion always show low elastic modulus. Low ice adhesion (below 60 kPa) of tested surfaces may be determinative of small water adhesion force (from 180 to 270 [*]μN). Therefore, measurement of water adhesion force may provide an effective strategy for screening anti-icing or icephobic surfaces, and surfaces within specific values of water adhesion force will possibly lead to a low ice adhesion...|$|R
