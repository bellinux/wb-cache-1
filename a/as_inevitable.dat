5|$|Upon the {{official}} Belgian {{withdrawal from the}} Western Alliance, the Belgians refused to engage in any official staff meetings with the French or British military staff for fear of compromising its neutrality. The Belgians did not regard a German invasion <b>as</b> <b>inevitable</b> and were determined that if an invasion did take place it would be effectively resisted by new fortifications such as Eben Emael.|$|E
5|$|After the Treaties of Tilsit of July 1807 Metternich {{saw that}} Austria's {{position}} in Europe {{was much more}} vulnerable but believed the accord between Russia and France would not last. In the meantime he found the new French Foreign Minister, Jean-Baptiste Champagny unaccommodating and struggled to negotiate a satisfactory settlement {{over the future of}} several French forts on the River Inn. Over the following months the reach of Austrian policy, and Metternich's own reputation, increased. Metternich pushed for a Russo-Austrian alliance, though Tsar Alexander was too preoccupied with the three other wars he was engaged in to commit. Over time, Metternich came to see an eventual war with France <b>as</b> <b>inevitable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Images of meth mouth {{are usually}} {{considered}} disturbing {{and have been}} used in anti-drug campaigns, even being placed on hoardings/billboards. The condition is often mentioned in media coverage of methamphetamine, and it has been included in media portrayals of drug abuse to demonstrate the scope of the drug's effects or to provoke disgust in the audience. Opponents argue that the term is used to negatively stereotype methamphetamine users, and that it is falsely portrayed <b>as</b> <b>inevitable</b> or characteristic.|$|E

5|$|In November 1938, Blamey was {{appointed}} {{chairman of the}} Commonwealth Government's Manpower Committee and Controller General of Recruiting. As such, he {{laid the foundation for}} the expansion of the Army in the event of war with Germany or Japan, which he now regarded <b>as</b> <b>inevitable.</b> In 1938 and 1939, he headed a successful recruiting campaign which doubled the size of the part-time volunteer Militia from 35,000 in September 1938 to 70,000 in March 1939. On 5 April 1939 he married Olga Ora Farnsworth, a 35-year-old fashion artist, at St John's Anglican Church, Toorak.|$|E
5|$|Irish legislators {{began to}} comment {{publicly}} from 2003, some tentatively suggesting legislation, and some referring to Catholic teachings. Among the general public, reaction was favourable, with a 2005 online poll showing most respondents seeing some recognition <b>as</b> <b>inevitable</b> and acceptable. More rigorous public polls taken during 2006 showed an increasing {{majority of the}} population, up to 80%, supporting the introduction of some partnership rights for same-sex couples, with a slim majority favouring full marriage. The numbers in favour of adoption by same-sex couples were lower but less clear.|$|E
5|$|The 28th (Māori) Battalion had {{its origins}} {{before the start}} of the Second World War. In mid-1939, as war in Europe began to be seen <b>as</b> <b>inevitable,</b> Sir Āpirana Ngata started to discuss {{proposals}} for the formation of a military unit made up of Māori volunteers similar to the Māori Pioneer Battalion that had served during the First World War. This proposal was furthered by two Māori MPs, Eruera Tirikatene and Paraire Paikea, and from this support within the Māori community for the idea began to grow as it was seen as an opportunity for Māoris to participate as citizens of the British Empire and to test their warrior skills. At first the New Zealand government was hesitant, but on 4 October, the decision was announced that the proposal would be accepted and that the battalion would be raised in addition to the nine battalions and support units that had already been formed into three brigades of the 2nd New Zealand Division.|$|E
50|$|Most {{construct}} are mindless automatons, obeying their creator's commands absolutely, {{which makes}} them unbribable and absolutely trustworthy, although {{some of them are}} very literal-minded about the execution of their duties, obeying orders to the letter without any concern for their intent.

50|$|From {{the time}} he became an apostle, Lee's {{eventual}} succession to the church presidency was seen <b>as</b> largely <b>inevitable,</b> <b>as</b> he was almost twenty years younger than any other apostle and succession to the presidency traditionally relies on length of service among the Twelve. Spencer W. Kimball and Ezra Taft Benson soon became apostles as well, followed by Mark E. Petersen in 1944, but Lee was the {{senior member of the}} new generation.|$|R
5|$|The twentieth-century philosopher Reinhold Niebuhr {{attempted}} to reinterpret the Augustinian theodicy {{in the light}} of evolutionary science by presenting its underlying argument without mythology. Niebuhr proposed that Augustine rejected the Manichean view that grants evil ontological existence and ties humans' sin to their created state. Augustine's argument continued, according to Niebuhr, by proposing that humans have a tendency to sin because of a biologically inherited nature and rejected the Pelagian view that human will could overcome sin on its own. Niebuhr believed Augustine's argument placed sin in the human will, which was corrupted by Adam's original sin. He argued that the logic behind Augustine's theodicy described sin <b>as</b> <b>inevitable</b> but unnecessary, which he believed captured the argument without relying on a literal interpretation of the fall, thus avoiding critique from scientific positions.|$|E

25|$|Given his and Nero's relationship, {{it was not}} {{surprising}} when Britannicus died just before his fourteenth birthday. Britannicus criticized Nero's singing voice, and referred to his adoptive brother by his original name of Lucius Domitius. In favoring Nero, Claudius sealed the fate of his son, and perhaps his own.

Instead, they concentrated on growing their influence with Nero.|$|E
