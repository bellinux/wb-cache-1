It chose the knitting fabric to be the object of study, and took the performance tests, which include basic performance, style, comfort and clothing comfort. After that, it analysis that these three variables— “fibers”, “yarn properties ” and “fabric performance” — influence clothing thermal-wet comfort. The statistic analyses include one-way <b>ANOVE,</b> correlation analysis and principal component analysis.

This was an experimental research using complete randomized design by involving three treatment groups and three control group, each with five replications. Materials consisted of radish tuber extract and 30 female mice of 8 weeks old divided into 6 groups, i. e., control groups of C 1, C 2, and C 3, and treatment groups of T 1, T 2, and T 3. C 1, C 2, and C 3 groups were given water of 1 Ã— 0. 5 cc/day per oral, 2 Ã— 0. 5 cc/day, and 3 Ã— 0. 5 cc/day respectively. Treatment groups of T 1, T 2, and T 3 were given radish tuber extract of respectively 1 Ã— 0. 5 cc/day per oral, 2 Ã— 0. 5 cc/day, and 1 Ã— 0. 5 cc/day. Treatment was carried out for 21 days.

40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{conditions}} for successful carrying out of professional duties for Ministry of internal affairs workers are adequately developed motoric abilities, especially considering application of physical force and enforcement methods. The aim {{of this paper is}} to establish differences of defi ned variables from motoric area of future employees of Ministry of internal affairs fi rst year students of CPA which are at the beginning of educational process, and persons with a good training of same gender and age. 37 of male test subjects were analyzed, 21 CPA student and 16 persons with good training. A set of six tests was used to estimate motoric abilities. Obtained results were analyzed from absolute and relative value aspects. Descriptive statistics were used to process the facts. By applying <b>ANOVE</b> general differences of variables between groups were established. Partial differences between variable pairs were established by using Student’s t-test. The results, obtained trough applicable set of six tests which defi ned their motoric abilities level from maximal isometric force aspect and also dynamic and repetitive strength of the whole body show that fi rst year students of CPA, at the beginning of educational process, demonstrate statistically and signifi cantly lower physical abilities compared to persons with good training of the same age. Given differences can be metro logically expressed with value level F= 521. 69 in absolute measures function, that is with value level F= 196. 6 in relative measures function. Next research should defi ne effect of existing SFO educational program on variations of given motoric abilities of fi rst year students, considering criteria and also considering persons with good training of the same age, that can potentially become a public safety threa...|$|E
