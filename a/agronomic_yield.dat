The experiment followed a factorial combination (3 composts types * 4 strains) with five replicates per treatment. One strain was a hybrid between French and Brazilian isolates. Strains and composts affected all variables analyzed (yield, number of basidiocarps, precociousness and earliness), except the weight of basidiocarps harvested.

MH 63, the male parent of SY 63, {{played a key role}} for the hybrid rice because of its well-combined traits of high yield, resistance to diseases and insects, and adaptability to diverse growing environments. The planting area of SY 63 started to gradually decline from the 1990 ’s because better and high-yielding hybrids based on the two-line hybrid rice system are developed and high quality of rice is more required by consumers. Also, as more and better rice varieties are being developed, farmers have more opportunities of choices for a hybrid variety based on yield, disease resistance, location adaption, as well as grain quality. However, MH 63 has still been used widely for development of male parents for two-line hybrids because of its excellent <b>agronomic,</b> <b>yield</b> and disease resistance traits. Since SY 63 was developed, no other hybrid rice variety has been planted at such a large scale. SY 63 has contributed tremendously to the security of the food supply in China, and has greatly promoted hybrid rice development.|$|E

40|$|Site-specific farming has {{provided}} an opportunity to collect large amounts of field data, but traditional <b>agronomic</b> <b>yield</b> response models have not been developed to exploit this information. This research presents several principles for constructing a reliable yield response function that can accommodate farm-level data that include independent variables other than soil fertility.

A model was estimated using this asymptotic plateau function and data from a northwest Kansas study farm. In the estimated yield model, which incorporates detailed site-specific field information (soil test and fertilizer N and P, soil organic matter content, soil texture, and soil pH), wheat yield responded principally to soil test P, meaning that P should be treated as a capital investment and that optimal P fertilization depends on the length of land tenure. An analytical framework was developed in which fertilizer P above crop removal builds up soil test P in future years, increasing wheat yields. That framework allowed simulation of baseline, profit-maximizing uniform, and site-specific fertilizer decisions.

However, {{the amounts of}} crop residues for these crop types are not well documented {{and they need to}} be accounted for in the modeling of soil organic carbon dynamics. Our objective was to review field measurements of root biomass left in the soil as crop residues at harvest for potato and sugar beet. We considered estimates for crop residue inputs as root biomass presented in the literature and some unpublished results. Our analysis showed that compared to, for example, cereals, the contribution of below-ground net primary productivity (NPP) to crop residues is at least two to three times lower for root crops. Indeed, the field measurements indicated that root biomass for topsoils only represents on average 25 to 30 g dry matter (DM) m(- 2) yr(- 1). Other estimates, albeit variable and region-specific, tended to be higher. We suggest relative plant DM allocation coefficients for <b>agronomic</b> <b>yield</b> (R-P), above-ground biomass (R-S) and root biomass (R-R) components, expressed as a proportion of total NPP. These coefficients, representative for temperate climates (0. 739 : 0. 236 : 0. 025 for potato and 0. 626 : 0. 357 : 0. 017 for sugar beet), should be useful in the modeling of agro-ecosystems that include root crops...|$|E
40|$|Intensively managed {{agricultural}} areas in North-Western Europe have been undergoing {{a shift from}} solely production oriented use to provision of multiple services and functions. Design and assessment of multifunctional agricultural landscapes could be supported by exploration of trade-offs between financial returns from agriculture, landscape quality, nature conservation and environmental quality. This paper presents the Landscape IMAGES methodology for spatially explicit exploration of options for multifunctional agriculture in landscapes at a scale of a few km 2. The framework has been developed to support discussions and inform decision making by local and regional policy makers, land owners and land managers. Other relevant stakeholders could include non-governmental organizations representing nature conservation and environmental protection objectives. The structure of the Landscape IMAGES framework prototype is elaborated and its functioning is illustrated with a near-real example of a grassland-dominated landscape with hedgerows bordering the fields. In this landscape, four objectives are being pursued by adjusting land-use intensity and hedgerow presence: (1) acceptable <b>agronomic</b> <b>yields</b> for farms, (2) diversification of the botanical composition of fields and hedgerows, (3) variation in plant communities {{in the fields and}} half-openness of the landscape, and (4) reduction of nutrient losses to the environment. For exploration of the trade-offs between multiple objectives a heuristic search method (i. e., differential evolution) is employed, which yields a large range of alternative, acceptable configurations of the landscape. The framework provides explicit insight in the trade-off between the objectives and is implemented in a visual application that enables the comparison of alternative options. The method can be applied to a range of spatially explicit land-use and nature allocation problems and will further evolve as a result of anticipated interactions with stakeholders...|$|R

40|$|Nitrification, a {{microbial}} process, is a {{key component}} and {{integral part of the}} nitrogen (N) cycle. Soil N is {{in a constant state of}} flux, moving and changing chemical forms. During nitrification, a relatively immobile N-form (NH 4 +) is converted into highly mobile nitrate-N (NO 3 -). The nitrate formed is susceptible to losses via leaching and conversion to gaseous forms via denitrification. Often less than 30 % of the applied N fertilizer is recovered in intensive agricultural systems, largely due to losses associated with and following nitrification. Nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) is defined as the biomass produced per unit of assimilated N and is a conservative function in most biological systems. A better alternative is to define NUE as the dry matter produced per unit N applied and strive for improvements in <b>agronomic</b> <b>yields</b> through N recovery. Suppressing nitrification along with its associated N losses is potentially a key part in any strategy to improve N recovery and agronomic NUE. In many mature N-limited ecosystems, nitrification is reduced to a relatively minor flux. In such systems there is a high degree of internal N cycling with minimal loss of N. In contrast, in most high-production agricultural systems nitrification is a major process in N cycling with the resulting N losses and inefficiencies. This review presents the current state of knowledge on nitrification and associated N losses, and discusses strategies for controlling nitrification in agricultural systems. Limitations of the currently available nitrification inhibitors are highlighted. The concept of biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) is proposed for controlling nitrification in agricultural systems utilizing traits found in natural ecosystems. It is emphasized that suppression of nitrification in agricultural systems is a critical step required for improving agronomic NUE and maintaining environmental quality...|$|R

In this paper, {{the development of an}} integrated modelling approach involving the coupling of a water application model with a biophysical crop simulation model (Aquacrop) to evaluate the in-field impacts of precision irrigation on crop yield and soil water management is described. The approach allows for a comparison between conventional irrigation management practices against a range of alternate so-called ‘precision irrigation’ strategies (including variable rate irrigation, VRI). It also provides a valuable framework to evaluate the <b>agronomic</b> (<b>yield),</b> water resource (irrigation use and water efficiency), energy (consumption, costs, footprint) and environmental (nitrate leaching, drainage) impacts under contrasting irrigation management scenarios. The approach offers scope for including feedback loops to help define appropriate irrigation management zones and refine application depths accordingly for scheduling irrigation. The methodology was applied to a case study in eastern England to demonstrate the utility of the framework and the impacts of precision irrigation in a humid climate on a high-value field crop (onions). For the case study, the simulations showed how VRI is a potentially useful approach for irrigation management even in a humid environment to save water and reduce deep percolation losses (drainage).

To explore genetic, environmental and developmental aspects of fruit yield in tomato, we phenotyped an introgression line (IL) population derived from a cross between the cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and a wild species (Solanum pennellii). Both homozygous and heterozygous ILs were grown in irrigated and non-irrigated fields and evaluated for six yield components. Thirteen lines displayed transgressive segregation that increased <b>agronomic</b> <b>yield</b> consistently over 2  years and defined at least 11 independent yield-improving QTL.

To further examine this unusual case, we evaluated the metabolic profiles of fruits from both the homo- and heterozygous lines for IL 8 - 3 and compared these to those obtained from the fruit of their equivalent genotypes in the root effect population. We observed that several of these metabolic QTL, like the yield QTL, were root determined; however, further studies will be required to delineate the exact mechanism mediating this effect in this specific line.

These sites were reclaimed both with and without topsoil application, and were under continuous grass or forest cover. In this report results are presented from the sites reclaimed in 1994 (R 94 -F), in 1987 (R 87 -G), in 1982 (R 82 -F), in 1978 (R 78 -G), in 1969 (R 69 -F), in 1956 (R 56 -G), and from the unmined control (UMS-G). Three sites are under continuous grass cover and three under forest cover since reclamation.

40|$|Declines of {{farmland}} birds have been pronounced in landscapes dominated by lowland livestock production and densities of seed-eating birds are particularly low in such areas. Modern livestock production often entails a simple cropping system dominated by ley grassland and maize grown for animal feed. These crops often lack invertebrate and seed resources for foraging birds {{and can be}} hostile nesting environments. Cereal-based wholecrop silages (CBWCS) offer potential benefits for farmland birds {{because they can be}} grown with minimal herbicide applications and can be spring-sown with following winter stubbles. We compared the biodiversity benefits and <b>agronomic</b> <b>yields</b> of winter-sown wheat and spring-sown barley as alternatives to grass and maize silage in intensive dairy livestock systems. Seed-eating birds foraged mainly in CBWCS fields during summer, and mainly on barley stubbles during winter and this reflected the higher densities of seed-bearing plants therein. Maize and grass fields lacked seed-bearing vegetation and were strongly avoided by most seed-eating birds. Production costs of CBWCS {{are similar to those of}} maize and lower than those of grass silage. Selective (rather than broad-spectrum) herbicide application on spring barley crops increased forb cover, reduced yields (by 11 %) but caused only a small (< 4 %) increase in production costs. CBWCS grown with selective herbicide and with following winter stubbles offer a practical conservation measure for seed-eating farmland birds in landscapes dominated by intensively-managed grassland and maize. However, the relatively early harvesting of CBWCS could destroy a significant proportion of breeding attempts of late-nesting species like corn bunting (Emberiza calandra) or yellow wagtail (Motocilla flava).

The partial budget analysis however indicated that net benefit were higher for Maize/kenaf (193, 800 and 198, 480) and kenaf/African yambean intercrop (186, 970 and 188, 050) in 2003 and 2004 respectively than for any of the other treatments. Also, sole Kenaf and Kenaf/African yam bean intercrop yielded promising Marginal Rate of Return (MRR) of 1096 and 640. 5 % respectively for year 2003 while sole Kenaf, Kenaf/African yam bean and maize/Kenaf intercrops gave MRR of 1104. 4, 620 and 71. 9 %, respectively in year 2004.

Genotypes with high potential included: NOKH 1004 (9. 55 ton), FV-Unn-manna (5. 85 ton), NOHK 1003 (5. 17 ton), NOKH 1002 (2. 83 ton), FV-Kpazeya (2. 83 ton), TZ-SMN- 86 (2. 30 ton), AAK (2. 11 ton), NB- 55 -Srivan (1. 98 ton), Sasilon (1. 70 ton), FV-Unn (2. 20 ton) and Ex-Makutopora (1. 27 ton). Genotypes Sasilon, NOKH- 1004, NB- 55 -Srivan and NOKH- 1003 recorded the highest ranking among farmers during the PVS. High yielding and early maturing genotypes which are amendable to drying may show wide adoption rate due to the premium on dehydrated okra. These genotypes can be suggested as candidates for inspection by the National Variety Release and Technical Committee for release to farmers to increase access to improved okra varieties.

40|$|Traditional {{sampling}} methods are inadequate {{for assessing the}} interrelated physical, chemical, and biological soil properties responsible for variations in <b>agronomic</b> <b>yield</b> and ecological potentials across a landscape. Recent advances in computers, global positioning systems, and large-scale sensors offer new opportunities for mapping heterogeneous patterns in soil condition. We evaluated field-scale apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) mapping for delineating soil properties correlated with productivity and ecological properties. A contiguous section of farmland (250 ha), managed as eight fields in a no-till winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) –corn (Zea mays L.) –millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) –fallow rotation, was ECa mapped (≈ 0 - to 30 -cm depth). A geo-referenced soil-sampling scheme separated each field into four ECa classes that were sampled (0 - to 7. 5 - and 7. 5 - to 30 -cm depths) in triplicate. Soil physical parameters (bulk density, moisture content, and percentage clay), chemical parameters (total and particulate organic matter [POM], total C and N, extract- able P, laboratory-measured electrical conductivity [EC 1 : 1], and pH), biological parameters (microbial biomass C [MBC] and N [MBN], and potentially mineralizable N), and surface residue mass were significantly different among ECa classes (P ≤ 0. 06) at one or both depths (0 – 7. 5 and 0 – 30 cm). Bulk density, percentage clay, EC 1 : 1, and pH were positively correlated with ECa; all other soil parameters and surface residue mass were negatively correlated. Field-scale ECa classification delimits distinct zones of soil condition, providing an effective basis for soil sampling. Potential uses include assessing temporal impacts of management on soil condition and managing spatial variation in soil-condition and yield-potential through precision agriculture and site-specific management...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{energy demand}} and {{spiraling}} {{oil prices are}} the cause of financial strain on countries and also causing environmental degradation. Use of non-edible oil as biodiesel provides a win-win proposition for the densely populated Asian countries. Perennials such as Pongamia pinnata and Jatropha curcas have offered an excellent opportunity to remedy the problems of environmental protection and oil crisis. Strategies for rehabilitating degraded lands and improving livelihoods through biodiesel plantations based on field experiences are discussed. Although technology, policy support, {{and the demand for}} biodiesel are increasing, the main constraint is supply of raw material. Validated and good quality data on <b>agronomic</b> practices, <b>yield</b> potential, diseases and pests occurrence, water requirement and management for block plantations are not available. There is an urgent need to undertake research on all aspects of biodiesel plantations...|$|R
40|$|Foxtail millet (Setaria italica) is an {{important}} crop possessing C 4 photosynthesis capability. The S. italica genome was de novo sequenced in 2012, but the sequence lacked high-density genetic maps with <b>agronomic</b> and <b>yield</b> trait linkages. In the present study, we resequenced a foxtail millet population of 439 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) and developed high-resolution bin map and high-density SNP markers, which could provide an effective approach for gene identification. A total of 59 QTL for 14 agronomic traits in plants grown under long- and short-day photoperiods were identified. The phenotypic variation explained ranged from 4. 9 to 43. 94 %. In addition, we suggested {{that there may be}} segregation distortion on chromosome 6 that is significantly distorted toward Zhang gu. The newly identified QTL will provide a platform for sequence-based research on the S. italica genome, and for molecular marker-assisted breeding...|$|R
40|$|Common bean is an {{important}} crop in Brazil primarily because of its nutritional characteristics. Some agronomic practices, such as weed management, are fundamental to cultivation, {{as a means of}} obtaining a high crop yield. However, some studies have shown that weed management may alter the function of the cultivar cycle. Thus, this study aimed at determining the optimal phenological stage in early-maturing common bean cultivars to perform the weed control without providing reductions in yield and seed quality. The experimental design was randomized blocks with 20 treatments and four replications, in a 2 × 2 × 5 (cultivars × types of weed control × periods of weed control) factorial scheme. The periods of weed control for both cultivars (Carioca Precoce and IPR-Colibri) consisted of full cycle weeded (control), weed control at the V 4 - 3 stage (first three nodes on the main stem with trifoliate leaves), at the R 5 stage (beginning of bloom) and at the R 8 stage (appearance of pods) and full cycle unweeded (no weed control). The types of weed control used were chemical (fluazifop-p-butyl + fomesafen) and mechanical (hoe). The Carioca Precoce cultivar demonstrated higher <b>agronomic</b> performance and <b>yield</b> than the IPR-Colibri cultivar, although the IPR-Colibri seeds had a higher vigor. The type of weed control (chemical or mechanical) did not affect the <b>agronomic</b> characteristics, <b>yield</b> and seed physiological potential of the cultivars. The ideal period for weed control in early-maturing common bean cultivars to obtain a higher yield and seed physiological potential was observed at the V 4 - 3 phenological stage...|$|R
