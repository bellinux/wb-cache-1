5|$|During {{the early}} 1960s, Toronto International Airport was {{expanded}} {{with the construction}} of the <b>Aeroquay</b> One terminal.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} program {{included the}} construction of several brand-new facilities, including a jetty for flights to the United States (US Preclearance Terminal), another for other international destinations (International Terminal) and a huge international arrivals complex. An 18-gate Transborder Concourse opened in 2003, an 11-gate International Concourse opened in 2004, new customs hall and baggage claim area for non-domestic flights and an expanded parking garage opened in 2005. Additionally, sections of the domestic area were renovated and expanded in 2007, accompanied with additional retail space. The International part of the <b>Aeroquay</b> satellite was demolished in 2008, leaving the domestic part for regional carriers. The completion of the CAD716 million expansion gives Montréal–Trudeau the ability to serve 15 million passengers a year. This ironically accomplished {{one of the goals}} that was to be met with {{the construction of}} Mirabel. (In the 1970s, the federal government projected that 20 million passengers would be passing through Montreal's airports annually by 1985, with 17 million through Mirabel). Aéroports de Montréal financed all of these improvements itself, with no government grants. By the end of 2007, CAD1.5 billion had been spent to upgrade Montréal–Trudeau.|$|E
2500|$|Passengers walked {{as little}} as [...] going from the curb to the gate. Once there, {{passengers}} would be transported to their aircraft by Passenger Transfer Vehicles (PTVs), rather than walking through jetways. The PTVs, similar to those at Washington Dulles International Airport, ran from the terminal to the aircraft parking spot on the ramp. It was reported by Radio-Canada/Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{that each of these}} vehicles had cost up to C$ 400,000 at the time. To eventually make connections between flights easier, the terminal also included a few jetways, in a smaller concourse called the <b>Aeroquay,</b> accessible via an underground tunnel and later connected directly to the main concourse.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aeroquay</b> One ceased {{operations}} on April 5, 2004, on {{the completion of}} {{the first phase of the}} new Terminal 1. <b>Aeroquay</b> One was subsequently demolished to facilitate expansion of the new Terminal 1.|$|E
5000|$|The third [...] "TCA" [...] {{terminal}} was demolished in {{the late}} 1960s and replaced by the <b>Aeroquay</b> One terminal building, which was built further south of the original site along Airport Road. <b>Aeroquay</b> One (also called Terminal One) had a square central structure housing ticketing and baggage facilities topped by a parking garage with about eight levels and ringed by a two-storey passenger concourse leading to the gates. It was designed by John B. Parkin, with construction taking place between 1957 and 1964. <b>Aeroquay</b> One was officially opened on February 28, 1964 by Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson.|$|E

5000|$|The GTAA also {{initiated}} {{a program to}} build a new Terminal 1 to replace both <b>Aeroquay</b> One and Terminal 2. The new terminal, costing $4.4 billion was a joint venture of Skidmore Owings & Merrill, Adamson Associates, and Moshe Safdie Associates.

5000|$|Terminal 3, {{which opened}} on February 21, 1991, was {{originally}} built to offset traffic {{from the former}} <b>Aeroquay</b> 1 and former Terminal 2. Terminal 3 was designed by B+H Architects and Scott Associates Architects Inc. The terminal, initially referred to as [...] "Trillium Terminal 3" [...] or the [...] "Trillium Terminal", was originally built as a private venture and was the base {{of operations for the}} now defunct Canadian Airlines.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} 1960s, Toronto International Airport was {{expanded}} {{with the construction}} of the <b>Aeroquay</b> One terminal.To serve the expected demand of the expansion, the DHO built a new four lane freeway north from Highway 401 at Renforth Drive. This new route, which roughly followed the same route as Highway 427 as far as Dixon/Airport Road, was known as the Toronto Airport Expressway and was opened on January 3, 1964.It featured a connection with the western terminus of Richview Sideroad {{at the southern end of}} the interchange with Highway 401 as well as an interchange with Renforth Drive.|$|E
