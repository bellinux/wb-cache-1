40|$|In the 2014 {{finalised}} {{timetable for}} Sweden 314 operation days had a {{unique set of}} trains i. e. a unique traffic pattern. Despite this, the finalised timetable generally provides only one conflict resolved <b>train</b> <b>path</b> for each <b>train,</b> and this <b>train</b> <b>path</b> is to be used for all of the train’s operation days. Further, once the yearly timetable has been finalised <b>train</b> <b>paths</b> may not be changed, causing great inflexibility in later planning stages. Rather than finalizing entire <b>train</b> <b>paths</b> only certain characteristics of a <b>train</b> <b>path,</b> called delivery commitments, could be finalised. This allows for more flexibility in later planning stages. Delivery commitments could e. g. be arrival and departure times at important locations or the total running time, depending on the needs of the operator. In this paper we present a method for generating delivery commitments based on analyzing a yearlong timetable, called the control timetable. The control timetable is constructed using rolling horizon planning and a MIP-model that optimises the <b>train</b> <b>paths</b> for each day individually. Further, different <b>train</b> <b>path</b> characteristics are optimized for different operators. The proposed method was tested in a case study from Sweden. The results show that by constructing one <b>train</b> <b>path</b> for each individual day rather than one for the entire year the resulting delivery commitments allow for a more efficient use of infrastructure. The results also show that the proposed method allows for different <b>train</b> <b>path</b> characteristics to be optimised for different operators. ...|$|R

For two freight train corridors case studies are done: Kijfhoek – Venlo and Amersfoort – Bad Bentheim. For both corridors different timetable constructions are designed in DONNA with four different freight <b>train</b> <b>paths.</b> Conclusion of the research is that the timetable can be improved by scheduling faster freight <b>train</b> <b>paths</b> than the current ones. This is especially useful on corridors with limited infrastructure.

40|$|The train {{timetable}} {{dominates the}} rail traffic organization. The timetabling quality {{should be evaluated}} to check the work skill of train timetable managers. The values of existing timetable evaluation indexes vary with infrastructure features and traffic flow; therefore, they are not comparable in fact. Furthermore, subjective inputs like expert scores are involved in evaluation; this will lead to unreliable results because the experts may have different opinions. To overcome these shortages, we propose a relative <b>train</b> <b>path</b> efficiency index by taking the <b>train</b> <b>paths</b> as production units. Each unit consumes some transport resources and produces some feedback outputs. A DEA model is applied to compute the <b>train</b> <b>path</b> efficiency. Two statistical functions of <b>train</b> <b>path</b> efficiency are {{used to evaluate the}} timetabling quality. We verify our method with real-world timetables. First, we use the Shibantan-to-Xinqiao line timetable to test the relative feature of the index proposed, and the results show that the <b>train</b> <b>path</b> efficiency value is relative and can reflect whether the stops are evenly distributed or not. Second, we evaluate the timetabling quality of another two timetables of the Qingdao-to-Jinan line with different traffic flows, and the results show that, compared with the 2012 timetable, the timetabling quality decreased in 2013...|$|R

40|$|Circuity, {{defined as}} {{the ratio of the}} {{shortest}} network distance to the Euclidean distance between one origin-destination (O-D) pair, can be adopted as a helpful evaluation method of indirect degrees of <b>train</b> <b>paths.</b> In this paper, the maximum circuity of the <b>paths</b> of operated <b>trains</b> is set to be the threshold value of the circuity of high-speed <b>train</b> <b>paths.</b> For the shortest paths of any node pairs, if their circuity is not higher than the threshold value, the paths can be regarded as the reasonable paths. With the consideration of a certain relative or absolute error, we cluster the reasonable paths {{on the basis of their}} inclusion relationship and the center path of each class represents a passenger transit corridor. We take the high-speed rail (HSR) network in China at the end of 2014 as an example, and obtain 51 passenger transit corridors, which are alternative sets of <b>train</b> <b>paths.</b> Furthermore, we analyze the circuity distribution of paths of all node pairs in the network. We find that the high circuity of <b>train</b> <b>paths</b> can be decreased with the construction of a high-speed railway line, which indicates that the structure of the HSR network in China tends to be more complete and the HSR network can make the Chinese railway network more efficient...|$|R

40|$|This {{project is}} {{concerned}} with how to improve the capacity allocation process. In particular the project aims at proposing an enhanced format for <b>train</b> <b>path</b> applications, study the technical limitations for timetabling support tools and {{in the longer term}} to implement support systems for the <b>train</b> <b>path</b> allocation process. This report describes the various factors that affect the application process, and report the opinions from several actors in the field. Since the deregulation of the Swedish railway, and with new EU directives, the foundations for the capacity allocation process is changing rapidly. There is a strong need for clear and predictable principles that are fair and operator neutral and implements the prioritisation given to different types of traffic and for improved methodologies and decision support tools in the capacity allocation process. This is crucial to support both the possibility for the traffic operators to state demands and the timetable designers in judging conflicting <b>train</b> <b>paths.</b> A conclusion is that almost all the requirements on the timetable presented in this report can in fact be stated as properties and relations of events in the timetable. ...|$|R
