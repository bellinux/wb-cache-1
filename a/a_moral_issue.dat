5|$|Jackson {{was among}} the councilman and {{citizens}} who expressed outrage at the light punishment issued by the mayor's office over a multimillion-dollar city contract scheme. Jackson viewed it as <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>issue</b> where the Mayor did not appropriately condemn immoral activity, which in her eyes encourages similar behavior. During a Summer 2008 violent crime rash she {{was among the}} aldermen calling for refocussed emphasis on adequate police support.|$|E
5|$|Moving {{into the}} 1960s, Marcus became ever more {{convinced}} that his city {{and his company}} needed {{to take action to}} promote racial equality, both as <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>issue</b> and to reduce the growing civil unrest. In 1968, he announced that Neiman-Marcus's buyers would give preference to companies employing and training significant numbers of minority employees, making his firm one of the first companies in the nation to have such a policy.|$|E
25|$|For many people, {{abortion}} is essentially <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>issue,</b> concerning {{the commencement of}} human personhood, {{the rights of the}} fetus, and a woman's rights over her own body. The debate has become a political and legal issue in some countries with anti-abortion campaigners seeking to enact, maintain and expand anti-abortion laws, while abortion rights campaigners seeking the repeal or easing of such laws while expanding access to abortion. Abortion laws vary considerably between jurisdictions, ranging from outright prohibition of the procedure to public funding of abortion. Availability of safe abortion also varies across the world.|$|E
50|$|Marine Le Pen {{supports}} abortion remaining legal, and opposes {{attempts to}} abolish public subsidies for abortion. However, she has commented {{that abortion is}} <b>a</b> serious <b>moral</b> <b>issue</b> that she feels is too often regarded as trivial by French society.|$|R
25|$|Pregnancy from rape is <b>an</b> {{ethical and}} <b>moral</b> <b>issue</b> {{in the context}} of {{opposition}} to legal abortion. In recent decades, claims of the improbability of rape-induced pregnancy, reminiscent of historical beliefs, have again begun {{to play a role in}} political discourse surrounding abortion regulation in cases of rape, particularly in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|Wild-animal {{suffering}} is the suffering experienced by nonhuman animals in nature through causes such as disease, injury, starvation, natural disasters, and killings by other animals. Wild-animal suffering {{has historically been}} discussed {{in the context of}} philosophy of religion as an instance of the problem of evil. More recently, a number of academics have considered the suspected scope of the problem from a secular standpoint as <b>a</b> general <b>moral</b> <b>issue,</b> one that humans might be able to take action towards preventing.|$|R
25|$|In the debates, Douglas reiterated {{his support}} of popular sovereignty. He demanded to know whether Lincoln would ever vote to admit a new slave state, even if the {{majority}} of settlers favored slavery. He denounced Lincoln for his insistence that slavery was <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>issue</b> {{that had to be}} resolved by the nation as a whole. Douglas described this as causing an unnecessary conflict between free and slave states, which threatened to boil up into disunion and war. He also asserted that Lincoln supported civil and social equality between the races, and insinuated that Lincoln even accepted interracial marriage.|$|E
25|$|In England and Wales, {{which had}} been {{politically}} united following the Norman invasion of Wales in the Late Medieval period, cunning folk had operated throughout {{the latter part of}} the Medieval and into the Early Modern period. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, there had been no attempt to illegalise the cunning craft, although private law suits had been brought against some of them by those clients who felt that they had been cheated out of their money. This changed with the Witchcraft Act of 1542, enacted under the reign of Henry VIII, which targeted both witches and cunning folk, and which prescribed the death penalty for such crimes as using invocations and conjurations to locate treasure or to cast a love spell. This law was repealed no later than 1547, under the reign of Henry's son Edward VI, something that the historian Owen Davies believed was due to those in power changing their opinion on the law: they believed that either the death penalty was too harsh for such crimes or that the practice of the cunning craft was <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>issue</b> that was better for the Church to deal with in ecclesiastic courts rather than a problem that had to be sorted out by the state.|$|E

[...] "Yes, I did. Other people found that preposterous. I suppose there's <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>issue</b> there. I {{think it would have been}} a very interesting thing though. I think it would have been very interesting had she gone off, because I suspected that there was that romance, attachment there, that obsession with her.

50|$|As the {{gay rights}} {{movement}} still paves the way for LGBT acceptance in all different aspects in American society, it has clearly created the possibilities of seeing homosexual roles in everyday television and film. It is no longer <b>a</b> full-out <b>moral</b> <b>issue</b> to see two men or women fall in love, have fun, and be themselves on camera. Though it is still slightly controversial to create homosexual characters in leading roles, the public has grown comfortable and has progressed with {{improving the quality of}} gay themes and images.|$|R
40|$|Poverty is <b>a</b> vital <b>moral</b> <b>issue</b> {{for people}} of faith. Poverty {{is the result of}} a complex set of global and local issues, not {{necessarily}} a reflection of any kind of failure on the part of those families living in poverty. Our calling as people of faith is not only to provide direct assistance to those in need, but also to address the underlying issues, including government and social policies, that keep people in poverty.

500|$|Such {{techniques}} were also integral to Maria Montessori's methods {{in the twentieth}} century. According to Cleverley and Phillips, the television show Sesame Street is also [...] "based on Lockean assumptions—its aim has been to give underprivileged children, especially in the inner cities, the simple ideas and basic experiences that their environment normally does not provide." [...] In many ways, despite Locke's continuing influence, as these authors point out, the twentieth century {{has been dominated by}} the [...] "nature vs. nurture" [...] debate in a way that Locke's century was not. Locke's optimistic [...] "environmentalism," [...] though qualified in his text, is now no longer just <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>issue</b> – it is also a scientific issue.|$|E
500|$|The Florida Citrus Commission reiterated its {{commitment}} to Bryant by stating that it [...] "wholeheartedly support(ed)" [...] her right to free speech, praising her [...] "courageous leadership on <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>issue</b> that it is tearing up religious and other organizations which have become involved". The commission received thousands of letters both supporting Bryant's stance and condemning the commission; {{at one point the}} U.S. Postal Service installed bomb detection equipment for the mail collected for delivery to the Florida Citrus Commission. The publicity director for the Florida Department of Citrus told a reporter from the Associated Press, [...] "The whole Anita thing is a mess. No matter what we decide, we're only going to lose. I wish she would just resign." [...] Although in 1979 the commission extended their $100,000 annual contract with Bryant, they did not renew it in 1980.|$|E
500|$|Things soon degraded, a legal {{hearing was}} held, and Sullivan {{supported}} Carte by making an affidavit erroneously stating {{that there were}} minor legal expenses outstanding from a battle Gilbert had with Lillian Russell. On 5 May 1890, Gilbert had written to Sullivan: [...] "The time for {{putting an end to}} our collaboration has at last arrived." [...] Gilbert later asked Sullivan to say he had been mistaken in his affidavit, but Sullivan refused. Gilbert felt it was <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>issue,</b> and could not look past it. Sullivan felt that Gilbert was questioning his good faith, and in any event, Sullivan had other reasons to stay in Carte's good graces: Carte was building a new theatre, the Royal English Opera House, to produce Sullivan's only grand opera, Ivanhoe. Gilbert brought suit, and after The Gondoliers closed in 1891, he withdrew the performance rights to his libretti, vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy.|$|E
40|$|The sharp {{widening}} of yield spreads among EMU sovereign bonds {{in the course}} of the economic crisis and concerns that some EMU member countries would encounter difficulties in rolling their existing debt and funding new budget deficits have revived proposals for a common bond issuance by EMU countries. Could these be put into practice without creating <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> hazard <b>issue</b> and conflicts with the no-bail-out clause of the Maastricht Treaty? Would the establishment of a European Monetary Fund offer better prospects of overcoming the present problems...|$|R
50|$|The episodes had minimal plots.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{political}} (mis) alignment on public service delivery when mandates are shared between state and local governments. We analyze sewage treatment policies {{in the state of}} S 3 o Paulo, Brazil. Relying on difference-in-differences estimations, we establish a causal relationship between political alignment and higher sewage treatment provision. Conceptually, we find that, with uncertain local commitment and weakly enforceable local obligations, shared mandates lead to <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> hazard <b>issue</b> implying service under-provision. Our results show that political alignment attenuates such moral hazard effects...|$|R
500|$|On 22 April 1890, {{during the}} run of The Gondoliers, Gilbert {{discovered}} that maintenance expenses for the theatre, including a new £500 carpet for the front lobby of the theatre, were being charged to the partnership instead of borne by Carte. [...] Gilbert confronted Carte, and Carte refused to reconsider the accounts: Even though {{the amount of the}} charge was not great, Gilbert felt it was <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>issue</b> involving Carte's integrity, and he could not look past it. [...] Gilbert {{wrote in a letter to}} Sullivan that [...] "I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen". [...] Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte [...] "in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial." [...] Gilbert brought a lawsuit, but Sullivan sided with Carte, who was building the Royal English Opera House, the inaugural production of which was to be Sullivan's forthcoming grand opera.

50|$|It {{may also}} {{be applied to the}} morals of public life. Political corruption, or the telling of lies in public statements, tarnish not only {{individual}} politicians, but the entire conduct of political life, whether at local or national level. These are fairly universally regarded as blots on reputations, though in some cases there is a grey area between corruption and legitimate fund-raising. Whether the private lives of politicians are <b>a</b> public <b>morals</b> <b>issue</b> is not <b>a</b> matter of agreement, internationally speaking; the existence of an extramarital relationship of a Prime Minister would in some countries be considered a revelation well within the sphere of the public interest, while in other countries it would be considered quite irrelevant.|$|R

2500|$|Writer Ayn Rand {{argued in}} her book [...] that the {{protection}} of intellectual property is essentially <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> <b>issue.</b> The belief is that the human mind itself {{is the source of}} wealth and survival and that all property at its base is intellectual property.

40|$|A {{major reason}} that The Netherlands {{has taken a}} {{different}} approach {{to the rest of the}} world on such <b>a</b> fundamental <b>moral</b> <b>issue</b> is that the courts and legislature in that country have accorded the interests of doctors a cardinal role in the euthanasia debate. This article argues that the interests of doctors are of only incidental and peripheral relevance in relation to the moral status of euthanasia. The moral status of euthanasia has little to do with the preparedness ofdoctors to administer the lethal injection or their general attitude towards the practice. Euthanasia is principally about the interests of the patient and the impact that the practice may have on the community in general, not preserving the conscience or improving the working life ofdoctors...|$|R
40|$|Child {{prostitution}} in Thailand became {{visible in}} the 1990 s.

Legal interventions that prosecuted parents and clients {{were put in place}} to solve the problem. However, these policies failed to consider ethnographic research on how children and families understood prostitution, and the role it played in their kinship systems and moral economies. In this article, I look at how the problem has been conceptualized. I argue that without a fuller understanding of family relationships and the reciprocal obligations between children and parents, and without listening to children themselves, interventions to protect children were bound to fail...|$|R

2500|$|As {{with many}} {{supporters}} of slavery, during his early years, Emerson {{seems to have}} thought that the faculties of African slaves were not equal to their white owners.

Emerson saw the removal of people from their homeland, the treatment of slaves, and the self-seeking benefactors of slaves as gross injustices.

50|$|Detractors {{of deposit}} {{insurance}} claim the schemes introduce <b>a</b> <b>moral</b> hazard <b>issue,</b> encouraging both depositors and banks {{to take on}} excessive risks. Without deposit insurance, banks would compete for deposits because depositors would prefer safe banks over risky banks to guard their money. With deposit insurance, banks can take excessive risks because depositors do not fear for their deposits’ safety and thus do not move their money to safer banks. The risks are shared by all banks, safe or risky. There are several examples where bank managers have made big money by lending money at high interest rates to risk customers, such as real estate speculation, and the government bailed out the banks while the managers kept their money and found new jobs.|$|R
