5|$|The inaccessibility of its habitat affords some {{protection}} for A.bradleyi. Quarrying and strip mining may threaten the sandstone cliffs, {{especially on the}} Cumberland Plateau. Rock climbers and botanical collectors have also damaged populations of the fern. Toxic runoff from atop cliffs can <b>affect</b> <b>them,</b> and {{they may also be}} threatened by both natural and anthropogenic shading of cliffs due to increased tree growth at the cliff base, invasive vines overrunning the cliff face, or the piling of slash against the cliff after logging.|$|E

Quite simply, the Scottish people want to be more {{directly}} and deeply involved in the decisions that <b>affect</b> <b>them</b> and the generations to come. It is with this uppermost in mind that today we launch The National, a daily newspaper that will fly a vibrant flag for independence and the right for Scots to govern themselves.|$|E
5|$|Urban renewal {{programs}} are funded {{in part by}} federal grants. The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, which created the NRHP, requires that federal agencies give consideration to the opinions of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in assessing the impact their actions will have on listed properties and consider alternatives to any action that would destroy or significantly <b>affect</b> <b>them.</b> The listings of downtown Troy's districts and buildings therefore had the practical effect of preventing their demolition for urban renewal.|$|E

5|$|Red {{parasitic}} mites sometimes attach {{themselves to}} the dorsal region of crickets and may greatly <b>affect</b> <b>them.</b> The horsehair worm Paragordius varius is an internal parasite and can control the behaviour of its cricket host and cause it to enter water, where the parasite continues its lifecycle and the cricket likely drowns. The larvae of the sarcophagid fly Sarcophaga kellyi develop inside the body cavity of field crickets. Female parasitic wasps of Rhopalosoma lay their eggs on crickets, and their developing larvae gradually devour their hosts. Other wasps in the family Scelionidae are egg parasitoids, seeking out batches of eggs laid by crickets in plant tissues in which to insert their eggs.|$|E
5|$|The {{context of}} the Confrontation in the murk of Indonesian {{politics}} is extremely layered. Sukarno's choice of pursuing this strategy would {{come at the expense}} of an important program aiming at the rehabilitation of the damaged economy, as it relied upon funding from Britain and America, who would not support the strengthening of another Communist power forming in Asia. However, the Indonesian populace and much of the government, who had recently fought their way from the hands of Dutch rule, would likely not support the economic program as it would seem as if Indonesia was sliding back into the embrace of the 'imperialist' powers of the West. The proposal was also beginning to lose support from the army, as they learned that demobilisation and lessening of funding that the program entailed would <b>affect</b> <b>them</b> adversely. Confrontation, on the other hand, might serve as a far more stabilising force, as it garnered support from both the Communists and the military, whose internecine political conflict weakened Sukarno's government. A campaign could keep the army busy while the Communists became accepted into mainstream Indonesian politics, which the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) found favourable. The nationalist-leaning army was content to fight the Malaysians to both remove British influence from the region as well as to establish Indonesian dominance in Southeast Asia. Some of the military high command thought that conflict could solidify a central role for the army in Indonesian politics, as well as increase their budget and return the country to martial law, which would greatly empower the military. Short of all-out war, the military was largely supportive of Confrontation.|$|E

25|$|The {{wastewater}} {{exiting the}} anaerobic digestion facility will typically have {{elevated levels of}} biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). These measures of the reactivity of the effluent indicate an ability to pollute. Some of this material is termed 'hard COD', meaning it cannot be accessed by the anaerobic bacteria for conversion into biogas. If this effluent were put directly into watercourses, it would negatively <b>affect</b> <b>them</b> by causing eutrophication. As such, further treatment of the wastewater is often required. This treatment will typically be an oxidation stage wherein air is passed through {{the water in a}} sequencing batch reactors or reverse osmosis unit.|$|E
25|$|In 1837, Mihail Kogălniceanu {{published}} {{a book on the}} Roma people, in which he expressed the hope that it will serve the abolitionists. During the 1840s, the intellectuals began a campaign aimed at convincing the slaveholders to free their slaves. The Wallachian Cezar Bolliac published in his Foaie pentru Minte, Inimă şi Literatură an appeal to intellectuals to support the cause of the abolitionist movement. From just a few voices advocating abolitionism in the 1830s, in the 1840s, it became a subject of great debate in Romanian society. The political power was in the hand of the conservative boyars, who were also owners of large numbers of slaves and as such disagreed to any reforms that might <b>affect</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

25|$|As blood perfuses the system, it exerts shear and {{pressure}} {{forces on the}} vessel walls. At the same time, tissue growth outside the cardiovascular system pushes back {{on the outside of}} the vessel walls. These forces must be balanced to obtain an efficient energy state for low-cost delivery of nutrients and oxygen to all tissues of the embryo body. When growth of the yolk sac (external tissue) is constrained, the balance between vascular forces and tissue forces is shifted and some vascular branches may be disconnected or diminished during the remodelling process because they are unable to forge new paths through the compressed tissue. In general, the stiffness and resistance of these tissues dictates the degree to which they can be deformed and the way in which biomechanical forces can <b>affect</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to the {{doctrine}} of Valentinus, as described by , the youngest Aeon Sophia, in her passion to comprehend the Father of all, runs the danger of being absorbed into his essence, from which she is saved by coming {{in contact with the}} limiting power Horos, whose function it is to strengthen all things outside the ineffable Greatness, by confining each to its appointed place. According to this version Horos was a previously existing power; but according to another, and apparently a later account, Horos is an Aeon only generated on this occasion at the request of all the Aeons, who implored the Father to avert a danger that threatened to <b>affect</b> <b>them</b> all. Then (as Hippolytus tells the story, vi. 31) he directs the production of a new pair of Aeons, Christ and the Holy Spirit, who restore order by separating from the Pleroma the unformed offspring of Sophia. After this Horos is produced in order to secure the permanence of the order thus produced. Irenaeus (u. s.) reverses this order, and Horos is produced first, afterwards the other pair.|$|E
25|$|The {{timing of}} puberty can have {{important}} {{psychological and social}} consequences. Early maturing boys are usually taller and stronger than their friends. They have the advantage in capturing the attention of potential partners and in becoming hand-picked for sports. Pubescent boys often {{tend to have a}} good body image, are more confident, secure, and more independent. Late maturing boys can be less confident because of poor body image when comparing themselves to already developed friends and peers. However, early puberty is not always positive for boys; early sexual maturation in boys can be accompanied by increased aggressiveness due to the surge of hormones that <b>affect</b> <b>them.</b> Because they appear older than their peers, pubescent boys may face increased social pressure to conform to adult norms; society may view them as more emotionally advanced, despite the fact that their cognitive and social development may lag behind their appearance. Studies have shown that early maturing boys {{are more likely to be}} sexually active and are more likely to participate in risky behaviors.|$|E

25|$|The United Nations' 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, or CRC, is {{the first}} legally binding {{international}} instrument to incorporate {{the full range of}} human rights—civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights. Its implementation is monitored by the Committee on the Rights of the Child. National governments that ratify it commit themselves to protecting and ensuring children's rights, and agree to hold themselves accountable for this commitment before the international community. The CRC is the most widely ratified human rights treaty with 195 ratifications. South Sudan and the United States are the only two countries which have not ratified the CRC. The CRC is based on four core principles, namely the principle of non discrimination, {{the best interests of the}} child, the right to life, survival and development, and considering the views of the child in decisions which <b>affect</b> <b>them</b> (according to their age and maturity). The CRC, along with international criminal accountability mechanisms such as the International Criminal Court, the Yugoslavia and Rwanda Tribunals, and the Special Court for Sierra Leone, is said to have significantly increased the profile of children's rights worldwide.|$|E
25|$|NREM {{sleep is}} {{characterized}} by slow oscillations, spindles and delta waves. The slow oscillations {{have been shown to}} be from the cortex, as lesions in other parts of the brain do not <b>affect</b> <b>them,</b> but lesions in the cortex do. The delta waves {{have been shown to be}} generated by reciprocally connected thalamic and cortical neural circuits. During sleep, the thalamus stops relaying sensory information to the brain, however it continues to produce signals that are sent to its cortical projections. These waves are generated in the thalamus even in the absence of the cortex, but the cortical output seems to play a role in the simultaneous firing by large groups of neurons. The thalamic reticular nucleus is considered to be the pacemaker of the sleep spindles. This has been further substantiated by the fact that rhythmic stimulation of the thalamus leads to increased secondary depolarization in cortical neurons, which further results in the increased amplitude of firing, causing self-sustained activity. The sleep spindles have been predicted to play a role in disconnecting the cortex from sensory input and allowing entry of calcium ions into cells, thus potentially playing a role in Plasticity.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton {{closed the}} gap to Rosberg to be 1.9 seconds behind his {{teammate}} {{by the start of}} lap 50. Rosberg made his third (and final) pit stop from the lead on the same lap. Hamilton pushed hard following Rosberg's pit stop and made his own stop on the next lap and emerged narrowly behind his teammate (after being delayed by slower traffic) in second. Massa and Button made pit stops on the same lap and both drivers left the pit lane in fifth and sixth places. Button had closed up to Massa after the latter drove into the incorrect pit box. Hülkenberg was promoted into third but lost the position to Massa heading into the Senna chicane on the 54th lap. Hamilton attacked but Rosberg responded by going faster than his teammate in the middle sector but Hamilton was able to remain close with DRS assistance on the main straights. The two drivers pulled away from Massa and Button. Rosberg and Hamilton came across slower traffic but it did not <b>affect</b> <b>them</b> greatly enough to cause hindrance. On lap 61, Räikkönen—who was on 25-lap worn tyres—was pressured by Button heading into the Senna chicane but Räikkönen resisted the manoeuvre. Button held the racing line and went alongside Räikkönen on the back straight before eventually passing him around the outside at the Descida do Lago turn. Räikkönen lost momentum at the corner and was passed by Vettel. Alonso began to battle teammate Räikkönen who placed his car in a defensive position over the following few laps.|$|E
