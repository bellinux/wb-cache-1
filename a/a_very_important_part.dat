5|$|The Animaniacs series theme song, {{performed}} by the Warners, was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> of the show. In the series' first season, the theme won an Emmy Award for best song. Stone composed the music for the title sequence and Ruegger wrote the lyrics. Several Animaniacs albums and sing-along VHS tapes were released, including the CDs Animaniacs, Yakko's World, and Variety Pack, and the tapes Animaniacs Sing-Along: Yakko's World and Animaniacs Sing-Along: Mostly in Toon.|$|E
5|$|The 1920s {{was a new}} era for Indian {{women and}} is defined as 'feminism' that was {{responsible}} for the creation of localised women's associations. These associations emphasised women's education issues, developed livelihood strategies for working-class women, and also organised national level women's associations such as the All India Women's Conference. AIWC was closely affiliated with the Indian National Congress. Under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, it worked within the nationalist and anti-colonialist freedom movements. This made the mass mobilisation of women an integral part of Indian nationalism. Women therefore were <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> of various nationalist and anti-colonial efforts, including the civil disobedience movements in the 1930s.|$|E

25|$|Oil {{and natural}} gas {{production}} is also <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> of Saskatchewan's economy, although the oil industry is larger. Among Canadian provinces, only Alberta exceeds Saskatchewan in overall oil production. Heavy crude is extracted in the Lloydminster-Kerrobert-Kindersley areas.

The children need accept and give each other various forms of prosocial behaviour., to grow up as full people. I suppose, that we must implantthe foundations of prosocial behaviour into the children from their birth.

25|$|These seven regions {{have been}} {{acknowledged}} as a biodiversity hot-spot, having a generally {{greater number of}} endemic species than most other regions in Australia. The ecological damage done to this region through clearing, introduced species, by feral animals and non-endemic plants is also severe, and {{has resulted in a}} high proportion of plants and animals being included in the categories of rare, threatened and endangered species. In modern times many Aboriginal men were employed intermittently as rabbiters, and rabbit became an <b>important</b> <b>part</b> of Noongar diet in the early 20th century. The Noongar territory also happens to conform closely with the South-west Indian Ocean Drainage Region, and the use of these water resources played <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> seasonal <b>part</b> in their culture.|$|R
40|$|Youth is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> {{demographic}} <b>part</b> of the society, {{which plays}} dynamic and active role. Countries, which go through post-conflict reconstruction, {{have to deal}} with many serious problems. Until now, we have witnessed youth to be seen as one of the issues. The aim of this thesis is to look at youth from different point of view. Youth can also be an active and dynamic element contributing to peacebuilding activities and stabilization. Analyzing two post-conflict reconstructions in Kosovo and Mozambique, we determine factors, which have biggest effect on decision-making process and behaviour of young people. Afterwards, we will take a look at their needs and how to program post-conflict reconstruction in order to empower young people to be agents of peace and development in the area...|$|R

25|$|Music {{has always}} played <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> {{in the life}} of the school. Achimota’s {{achievements}} in attaining a high standard in this field led to the establishment of the Ghanaian National Symphony Orchestra and the department of music and performing art education at the University of Education, Winneba. From its inception Achimota placed special emphasis on the value of the use of one's hands in agriculture, technical and vocational. Achimota has concerned itself to set a standard of excellence in whatever field of education that meets the national needs.|$|E
25|$|Hadith {{have played}} <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> shaping Jesus' image among common Muslims, having become further {{developed}} when incorporating Hadiths and Tafsirs weaved into great amounts of legendary writings and reports. With the Muslim reshaping, the void of Jesus is surprising. What is instead written {{about is the}} ascetic magician, helped by the Holy Spirit. The Gospel {{is seen as a}} book to be preached and is only referred to in passing without mentioning actual teachings. Strikingly, the fictitious sayings and supposed teachings of Jesus are given preeminence in Hadith-collections, in Shia Islam, and in Sufi representations of Jesus.|$|E
50|$|The {{system had}} come to Japan {{at a time when}} Kamakura's five great Zen temples were already known as the Five Mountains, and it unified in one {{organization}} all the great temples of the dominant Zen schools of the time. It thus institutionalized <b>a</b> large and <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> of the Rinzai school, bringing to it the protection, but also the control of the state. The whole network of temples was supervised by a state bureaucracy created specifically for the task.|$|R
25|$|In 1923, the Northern Rhodesian copper {{industry}} was little developed, and the British {{government did not}} anticipate the future value of these mineral rights. It regarded them as <b>a</b> not <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> of the overall deal with the company. The lack of any challenge to the BSAC's claims and {{the decision not to}} refer them to the Privy Council led to suspicion that the company received favoured treatment. There were family links between a junior Colonial Office minister and the BSAC director leading its negotiations, but no evidence to suggest this led to any bias. The most probable explanation is that the importance of the minerals was overlooked in the haste to achieve a settlement. Because of lack of time, the agreement was not approved by the Attorney-General.|$|R
40|$|In {{modelling}} of elastic objects {{immersed in}} <b>a</b> fluid, <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> {{of the model}} is the interaction between objects and fluid. In models based on immersed boundary method and lattice-Boltzmann method, this interaction is mediated by friction coefficient between fluid and particles. The friction coefficient is phenomenological {{and needs to be}} properly calibrated. In this work we design an experiment, the results of which can be predicted by theoretical computations. Based on the theory, we calibrate friction coefficient to properly describe the interaction between fluid and objects. The simulation experiments are performed in Object-in-fluid framework. We calibrate it for objects immersed in flow with low Reynolds number to model flow of cells inside microfluidic devices. We analyze dependence of interaction method on number of nodes and size of spherical object...|$|R
