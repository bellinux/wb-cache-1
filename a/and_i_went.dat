25|$|When I grew {{up there}} weren't many other guitarists... There was one other guitarist {{in my school}} who {{actually}} showed me the first chords that I learned <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> on from there. I was bored so I taught myself the guitar from listening to records. So obviously {{it was a very}} personal thing.|$|E
25|$|He {{laid down}} the laws for me. It was a good chat. I knew exactly where I stood with him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> away with a new belief, {{in terms of where}} I wanted to head. It gave me a lot of {{confidence}} to know that if I went back and scored runs in grade cricket and 2nd XI, I could get back into the team straight away.|$|E
25|$|A {{collaboration}} {{is like a}} good conversation, Nicola came to my studio {{a couple of times}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to hers; we initially chatted about her music, the forthcoming album and how this related to her vision for the shoes. I went away and started designing my response to this. After our first meeting I was excited by her ideas and collaborating with people who have a strong vision is really fantastic. Nicola considers everything she does really carefully and has a totally clear view of what she wants to achieve. While the shoes are just a small part of this, I knew it would be interesting and fun to work together.|$|E

25|$|In 1920, {{after the}} end of the First World War, Sassoon {{returned}} to Baghdad from Istanbul and was appointed Minister of Finance in the first Iraqi government, a new provisional government under the premiership of Abd Al-Rahman Al-Naqib. The importance of his role was what was to make or break the new constitution of Iraq. The details of this were highlighted by Gertrude Bell when she recounted the circumstances regarding the establishment of Iraq’s new government. Dated 1 November 1920, Bell wrote:“On Wednesday morning all seemed to be going well. In the afternoon Major Yetts <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> out sightseeing in Baghdad and on our way home dropped in to tea with the Tods. Mr Tod sprung upon us that he had called on Sasun Eff to congratulate him on his becoming Minister of Finance and found him with Hamdi Pasha Baban (who had been offered a seat in the Cabinet without portfolio,) both in the act of refusing. Mr Tod had done his best to persuade them but had heard in the afternoon that they had refused, the real, though not the expressed reason, being that they would not join a Cabinet which contained Saiyid Talib.|$|E
25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E
500|$|In his autobiography, Ganesan {{recalled}} {{that during the}} Afro-Asian film festival, [...] "I was called on stage <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> up a diminutive, five foot nothing, looking boyish with my build, whereas they had expected {{me to be a}} colossus, on seeing [...] Kattabomman, at least seven or eight feet tall! Irrespective of this they gave me a standing ovation for five minutes." ...|$|E

500|$|The filmmaker {{ended up}} {{splitting}} {{his time between}} making his film, responding to criticism, and conducting a publicity campaign of his own that saw him [...] "omnipresent, from CBS Evening News, to Oprah." [...] However, the Lardner Post piece stung the most because Lardner had stolen {{a copy of the}} script. Stone recalls, [...] "He had the first draft, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> through probably six or seven drafts." ...|$|E
500|$|Appearing on Nikita {{would be}} Q's first {{television}} role. During {{an interview with}} IGN, Q explained {{that she had not}} been on television before [...] "not because I didn't want to. I just never thought about it," [...] adding [...] "When this came up, everything just felt right. I knew McG and when Wonderland came on he was like, 'This is you, we're not doing this without you.' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> 'That's very sweet!' So it felt right." ...|$|E
500|$|Maxwell {{also cited}} his {{grandmother}} and other West Indian women he knows as the inspiration behind his romantic notions. Music journalists inferred that {{the album was}} inspired by or based on an unsuccessful affair in Maxwell's life. Maxwell said in an interview, [...] "I'm so innately romantic and always have been, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> through this particular romantic experience and based my album on that". The album's liner notes have a dedication from Maxwell to his [...] "musze", stating [...] "I could never have done this without you".|$|E

500|$|Drake was {{accustomed}} to keeping his own hours; he frequently had difficulty sleeping and often stayed up through the night playing and listening to music, then slept late into the following morning. Recalling {{the events of the}} night, his mother later said: [...] "I never used to disturb him at all. But it was about 12 o'clock, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> in, because really it seemed it was time he got up. And he was lying across the bed. The first thing I saw was his long, long legs." [...] There was no suicide note, although a letter addressed to Ryde was found close to his bed.|$|E
500|$|For me, I {{was a new}} {{actor to}} Los Angeles, didn’t know the TV {{business}} very well so I was just excited to work and play a vampire. I had no clue what I {{was going to do}} or how I was going to be scary. Until that is, they put the vampire makeup on me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> into the trailer and smiled, which I thought was creepy. Joss always said he was intrigued that someone who looked like me and talked like me was like the scariest vampire ever. That's what he wanted, my sweet voice and demeanour until all of a sudden I'm just this vicious vampire." ...|$|E
500|$|As Berlin {{could not}} read or write music, and could only pick out tunes on a {{specially}} designed piano that transposed keys automatically, he required an assistant to make up his piano parts. Hal Borne – Astaire's rehearsal pianist – performed this role in Top Hat and recalled working nights {{with him in the}} Beverly Wilshire Hotel: [...] "Berlin went 'Heaven...' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> dah dah dee 'I'm in Heaven' (dah-dah-dee). He said, 'I love it, put it down.'" [...] These parts were subsequently orchestrated by a team comprising Edward Powell, Maurice de Packh, Gene Rose, Eddie Sharp, and Arthur Knowlton who worked under the overall supervision of Max Steiner.|$|E

500|$|Despite reusing some scripts {{from other}} sources, Perrin {{said that he}} and Sheekman [...] "had [...] hands full turning out a script each week". They found help from Tom McKnight and George Oppenheimer, whose names were passed along to Groucho. Perrin explained, [...] " [...] was in the men's room during a break, and he was {{complaining}} to the guy standing next to him, 'Geez, I wish we could find another writer or two to make life easier.' Suddenly there's a voice from one of the stalls: 'I've got just the guys for you!' Having Tom and George did make life easier, although Arthur <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> over their scripts for a light polishing." ...|$|E
500|$|The song became {{controversial}} for its supposed {{references to}} drugs. The BBC {{announced that it}} would not broadcast [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] due to the line [...] "I'd love to turn you on", which, according to the corporation, advocated drug use. Other lyrics allegedly referring to drugs include [...] "found my way upstairs and had a smoke / somebody spoke <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> into a dream". A spokesman for the BBC stated: [...] "We have listened to this song over and over again. And we have decided that it appears to go just a little too far, and could encourage a permissive attitude to drug-taking." [...] The ban was eventually lifted on 13 March 1972.|$|E
500|$|When the Game Boy was released, Tajiri {{thought the}} system was perfect for his idea, {{especially}} because of the link cable, which he envisioned would allow players to trade Pokémon with each other. This concept of trading information was new to the video gaming industry because previously connection cables were only being used for competition. [...] "I imagined a chunk of information being transferred by connecting two Game Boys with special cables, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> wow, that's {{really going to be}} something!" [...] said Tajiri. Tajiri was also influenced by Square's Game Boy game The Final Fantasy Legend, noting in an interview that the game gave him the idea that more than just action games could be developed for the handheld.|$|E

500|$|The Chariot is {{frequently}} called a Christian band, which Scogin agreed {{with in a}} 2005 interview: [...] "We are Christians in a band therefore we are a Christian band. We are not ashamed of our beliefs but we don’t force feed people what we believe either." [...] In 2006, he reaffirmed his previous statements and further opined, [...] "When I was growing up, if I liked , I listened to it — <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to the shows. If I didn't, I didn't. It wasn't like, 'Oh, they don't believe the same thing I do,' [...] People care {{too much about the}} fashion of it all. To me, a band's either good or they ain't, and that's the only thing that should matter." ...|$|E
500|$|Various {{accounts}} of Hubbard's {{service in the}} North Atlantic have been put forward by the Church of Scientology and Hubbard himself. The Church of Scientology states in one publication that Hubbard [...] "took command of an antisubmarine escort vessel with Atlantic convoys". In a 1954 lecture, Hubbard asserted {{that he had been}} sent [...] "to Boston in the very early part of the war to take command of a corvette" [...] and had been given a crew made up of convicts from the Portsmouth Naval Prison. Hubbard stated in another lecture that he had been posted aboard [...] "corvettes, North Atlantic. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> on fighting submarines in the North Atlantic and doing other things and so on. And I finally got a set of orders for the ship. By that time I had the squadron." ...|$|E
500|$|Greer was {{notified}} {{of the position}} by her agent while shooting for a separate film. [...] "I'd {{been trying to get}} into voiceovers," [...] she explained, [...] "so they called and said it was a pilot they were doing for FX, and I could record the part on my day off in 10 minutes." [...] The actress read the script and recorded her lines at a recording studio in Phoenix, Arizona; upon first glance, Greer suggested that the raunchy and risque nature of the script would prevent any television stations from picking up the series. [...] "So when I found out it was picked up, I was like, 'Oh! Wait, I don't know what you're talking about.' They said, 'Remember that thing?' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>went,</b> 'Really?' So then I recorded a bunch of them, and the scripts were the funniest scripts that I've ever read, and so crazy." ...|$|E
