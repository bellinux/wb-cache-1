25|$|All {{cultures}} forged by nations – {{the noble}} indigenous past of America, the brilliant civilization of Europe, the wise history of Asian nations, and the ancestral wealth of Africa and Oceania – are corroded by the <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life.

This is a planetary war, of the worst and cruelest kind, waged against humanity.|$|E
25|$|Slashes are {{a common}} {{calendar}} date separator used across many countries and by some standards such as the Common Log Format used by web servers. Depending on context, {{it may be in}} the form Day/Month/Year, Month/Day/Year, or Year/Month/Day. If only two elements are present, they typically denote a day and month in some order. For example, 9/11 is a common <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> writing the date September 11 and has become shorthand for the attacks on New York and Washington, DC, which occurred on a day Britons write as 11/9/2001. Owing to the ambiguity across cultures, this use is sometimes proscribed.|$|E

The San Bernardino restaurant was demolished in 1976 (1971, according to Juan Pollo) and the site was sold to the Juan Pollo restaurant chain. This area now serves as headquarters for the Juan Pollo chain, as well as a McDonald's and Route 66 museum. With the expansion of McDonald's into many international markets, the company has become a symbol of globalization and the spread of the <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life. Its prominence has also made it a frequent topic of public debates about obesity, corporate ethics, and consumer responsibility.|$|E

25|$|Zitkála-Šá {{was highly}} {{politically}} active {{throughout most of}} her adult life. During her time on the Uintah-Ouray reservation in Utah, she joined the Society of American Indians, a progressive group formed in 1911. It was dedicated to preserving the Native <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life while lobbying {{for the right to}} full American citizenship. Zitkala-Ša served as the SAI's secretary beginning in 1916. She edited its journal American Indian Magazine from 1918 to 1919. Since the late 20th century, activists have criticized the SAI and Zitkala-Ša as misguided in their strong advocacy of citizenship and employment rights for Native Americans. Such critics believe that Native Americans have lost cultural identity as they have become more part of mainstream American society.|$|E
25|$|Construction of the boys' school {{changed the}} way boys were educated at St. Peter's. Most {{instruction}} was now carried on indoors, in great contrast to the Native <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life at the time (in which most time was spent outdoors). The boys were responsible for maintaining the kitchen garden, herding and feeding the small herd of beef cattle, and feeding and milking the dairy cattle, so some time each day was spent in the barns, corrals, or garden. Small fields, watered by irrigation ditches, were also maintained by the boys. The curriculum did not change throughout the year. Boys were expected {{to work in the}} fields even in winter, and {{the amount of time spent}} indoors did not vary (even during summer, when the growing season demanded that most of the day be spent outdoors).|$|E
25|$|Japan {{would take}} {{advantage}} of Hitler's war in Europe to advance its own ambitions in the Far East. The Tripartite Pact guaranteed assistance if a signatory was attacked by any country not already involved {{in conflict with the}} signatory; this implicitly meant the U.S. By joining the pact, Japan gained geopolitical power and sent the unmistakable message that any U.S. military intervention risked war on both of her shores—with Germany and Italy on the Atlantic, and with Japan on the Pacific. The Roosevelt administration would not be dissuaded; believing the <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life would be endangered if Europe and the Far East fell under military dictatorship, it committed to help the British and Chinese through loans of money and materiel, and pledged sufficient continuing aid to ensure their survival. Thus, the United States slowly moved from being a neutral power to one preparing for war.|$|E
50|$|In Indigenous American communities, the {{inclusion}} of children in communal activities motivates them to engage with their social world, helping them to {{develop a sense of}} belonging. Active participation involves children undertaking initiative and acting autonomously. Similarly, Learning by Observing and Pitching In (LOPI) supports informal learning which generates self-sovereignty. The combination of children's inclusion, development of independence, and initiative for contribution are common elements identified in Indigenous <b>American</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> learning.|$|R

25|$|However, the Communist Party's early {{labor and}} {{organizing}} successes did not last. As the decades progressed, the combined {{effects of the}} second Red Scare, McCarthyism, Nikita Khrushchev's 1956 Secret Speech denouncing the previous decades of Joseph Stalin's rule and the adversities of the continued Cold War mentality, steadily weakened the party's internal structure and confidence. The party's membership in the Comintern and its close adherence to the political positions of the Soviet Union made the party appear to most Americans as not only a threatening, subversive domestic entity, {{but also as a}} foreign agent fundamentally alien to the <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life. Internal and external crises swirled together, to the point where members who did not end up in prison for party activities tended either to disappear quietly from its ranks or to adopt more moderate political positions at odds with the Communists' party line. By 1957, membership had dwindled to less than 10,000, of whom some 1,500 were informants for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).|$|E
25|$|Doughty's main {{inspiration}} for her advocacy work was the frequent {{absence of the}} decedents' families in the process, which she attributed to the Western death anxiety and death phobia. She wanted to encourage death acceptance, {{and a return to}} such practices as memento mori, reminders of one's own mortality, resulting in healthier grieving, mourning, and closure after the inevitable deaths of people around us, as well as starting a movement to broaden the funeral industry to offer more funeral options, such as natural burial, sky burial, alkaline hydrolysis (liquid cremation), or promession. Embalming began to dominate in the US after the Civil War. A century later, in the 1960s, Americans began to turn away from embalming and burial, as cremation became increasingly popular, so that today it is used in almost half of deaths in urban areas. Cremation is seen {{as a threat to the}} traditional funeral industry, but has a reputation as the more environmentally friendly option. This change can be traced to the lifting of the ban on cremation by Pope Paul VI in 1963, and to the publication in the same year of The <b>American</b> <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> Death by Jessica Mitford, documenting abuses in the funeral industry and criticizing the excessive cost of funerals. Mitford's book, and the movement it started, was one of Doughty's inspirations, but Doughty feels that while Mitford had the right target, the profit-driven funeral industry, Mitford erred in sharing the industry's, and the public's, unhealthy desire to push out of sight and avoid thinking about the corpse itself. Doughty seeks to build on Mitford's reforms but in a direction that embraces the reality of death and returns to funeral and mourning practices that include spending time with and having contact with the dead body itself.|$|E

2500|$|The {{other side}} of the issue—tribal rights—also carries {{important}} points of consideration. Native American tribes enjoy a limited status as sovereign nations but are legally considered as [...] "domestic dependent nations" [...] as opined by the Marshall Court in 1829. Native Americans have always had difficulty finding a source of steady income. Traditional Native <b>American</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> life had been taken away, and so a new way to be economically independent was needed. Widespread poverty among Native Americans continues today, nearly two hundred years later. Gaming is one way to alleviate this poverty and provide economic prosperity and development for Native Americans.|$|R

At the time, he did not reveal that this was for research, and instead pretended to have a dying relative. According to Maxtone-Graham, the tour helped him find out [...] "all about urns versus coffins, and cremation. I asked sort of questions about, 'Well, do the bodies smell?'

40|$|Objectives. Among American Indians (AIs), an {{important}} {{relationship has been}} theorized between cultural identification and substance abuse, including smoking. We investigated the relationship between cultural identification and smoking among AI adults. Design. Using the Orthogonal Cultural Identification Scale (OCIS), we {{examined the relationship between}} AI and White cultural identification and cigarette use in a sample of AI recruited at an urban Indian center (n= 217). Results. We found that high AIs identification predicted smoker status and high White identification predicted non-smoker status when controlling for age and reservation residence. Orthogonal cultural identification status (categorized as high White/high AI, high White/low AI, low White/high AI, or low White/low AI) did not predict smoker status when controlling for age and reservation residence. OCIS item analysis revealed that positive responses to the individual OCIS items 'My family lives by the <b>American</b> Indian <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life,' 'I live by the <b>American</b> Indian <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life,' and 'I am a success in the <b>American</b> Indian <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life' predicted smoker status when controlling for age and reservation residence. Conclusions. Our data suggest that, among some groups of urban AIs, recreational smoking is associated with AI cultural identification...|$|R

In 1947, during the Second Red Scare, Disney testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), where he branded Herbert Sorrell, David Hilberman and William Pomerance, former animators and labor union organizers, as communist agitators; Disney stated that the 1941 strike led by them was part of an organized communist effort to gain influence in Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|Postmodern {{cultural}} critic bell hooks {{cited the}} interaction in the Memphis train station between Thomas and the Japanese couple {{as one of}} the few examples of nuanced, deconstructive and subversive treatment of blackness in American film.

[...] He later included the movie in his Great Movies collection, comparing the movie favorably to Jarmusch's later efforts like Dead Man and The Limits of Control. In an April 2000 retrospective of Jarmusch's work for Sight & Sound, Shawn Levy concluded that the film was [...] "as much a valentine to the allure of the <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> pop culture as it is a cheeky bit of structural legerdemain without terribly much resonating significance".|$|E

Accounts in both Arizona and New Mexico indicate birds visiting regularly, as well as over-wintering in Arizona. However, these accounts co-occurred with heavy shooting, logging, and development that extirpated the thick-billed parrot from its US range.
