5|$|In {{the later}} {{parts of his}} career and {{especially}} following retirement, Gascoigne's life became dominated by severe mental and emotional problems, particularly alcoholism. He has been jailed or sectioned on numerous occasions and his personal struggles receive regular coverage in the British press. He has frequently attempted to live without alcohol, though rehabilitation programmes have provided only temporary relief. His personal issues ended his coaching career, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> worked in football since being fired as the manager of Kettering Town in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Then-Bruins {{head coach}} Don Cherry {{suggested}} that the reason Orr never re-signed with the Bruins was Orr's complete trust in Eagleson at the time (Orr said that he described Eagleson as a brother). Cherry recalled Orr had refused {{to speak with the}} Bruins team president directly, allowing Eagleson to mislead or withhold enough details from Boston's offer. Orr's departure from the Bruins was acrimonious <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> held an official role with the Bruins since. Years later, it emerged that Eagleson had very good relations with Black Hawks owner Bill Wirtz and NHL president John Ziegler that colluded to hold back salaries of certain players. Orr disassociated himself from Eagleson in 1980.|$|E

25|$|In 1988, the {{government}} of Spain arrested Scientology president Heber Jentzsch and ten {{other members of the}} organization on various charges including illicit association, coercion, fraud, and labor law violations. Jentzsch jumped bail, leaving Spain and returning to the United States after Scientology paid a bail bond of approximately $1 million, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> returned to the country since. Scientology fought the charges in court for fourteen years, until the case was finally dismissed in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Eutichio della Castagna, {{an impoverished}} poet, sees the sign {{and decides to}} accept Raimondo's offer. Raimondo gives him the keys and {{provides}} him with a pistol in case he becomes frightened by the ghosts. In an aside to Callisto, Raimondo asks {{what happened to the}} lovely young orphan who had been sheltering there and confesses that he has long loved her from afar. Callisto tells him that Annetta had left months ago <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> heard from her since.|$|E

25|$|Mariano's first {{experience}} with art was at fours years old with his cousin, teaching him how to draw simple shapes. He and his brother, Jonathan Ching who would also grow up to become an artist, would spend their time to draw instead of playing outside. He was greatly influenced by the anime Mazinger Z and Voltes V which was widely popular during his youth. They would significantly affect his future works. Reaching his high school years, his parents reminded him to think carefully about his life career. They {{said there is no}} money in art and should consider medicine or engineering as career and to make art as a hobby. But despite his parents' constant reminder, Mariano still pursued the road of becoming an artist. He enrolled to a lot of art workshops to hone his skills. One of the workshops that he attended became the turn point of his life. At the art workshop which is headed by Elemer Borogan and Gina Morales, the art style of the paintings has touched him and made him to decide to switch from his fourth year engineering major to painting major in University of the Philippines. During his years in University of the Philippines, he co-founded the art group Surrounded by Water. There, he found his future wife, Yasmin Sison which {{is also a member of}} Surrounded by Water. Mariano Ching, at that time, was still new at the art scene <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> garnered any recognition yet.|$|E
500|$|The {{fact that}} the CD book voice actors, {{especially}} Tomokazu Seki and Megumi Ogata, who portrayed Sanosuke and Kenshin in the CD books, respectively, did not get their corresponding roles in the anime disappointed Watsuki. Ueda, Sanosuke's voice actor in the Japanese anime, commented that voicing Sanosuke in the original video animations was very complicated because his character was notably older <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> acted in the role for a long period. He {{also said that he}} would have liked to see more fights involving Sanosuke in the original video animations, but was happy to see that Sanosuke had matured as a character. Lex Lang, the voice actor of Sanosuke in the English adaptation of the anime, commented that his first impression of Sanosuke was as a fight-driven character motivated by anger, but as the story continued Sanosuke became friendly and more likable. Because his voice is noticeably different from Ueda's, Lang tries to create his own interpretation of Sanosuke's character. Lang has noted that the scene of the episode 22 of the anime, in which Sanosuke is afraid of a train because he believes it is a demon, was the most enjoyable scene for him to record; he added [...] "I recently saw it and had some big laughs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Apiata {{was born}} in Mangakino, New Zealand. [...] His father is Maori and his mother is Pakeha.

2500|$|During the 2002 {{election}} campaign, Renzi {{proposed that}} Walnut Canyon National Monument in Northern Arizona be renamed the [...] "National Park of the American Flag" [...] {{with the addition}} an American flag theme to the park, including displays of U.S. flags throughout history. This {{was in response to}} proposals by local citizens that Walnut Canyon National Monument be expanded and given National Park status. Renzi's proposal was widely ridiculed, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> promoted it since.|$|E
2500|$|Again {{from his}} days at Trent College, {{he was also a}} keen cricketer. He had played for the Stock {{exchange}} XI and for Clapham Rovers who also ran a cricket section as well as fielding association and rugby football teams. He later played at county level for Herefordshire in 1886–89, Shropshire in 1887–89 and Radnorshire in 1888.

2500|$|Commerford is most {{commonly}} known as a pizzicato player, as he has never played live with a pick, but has also played in the past using the slapping technique. The only songs to date where Commerford's slapping is featured on are [...] "Take The Power Back" [...] and [...] "Know Your Enemy", off of Rage Against the Machine's debut self-titled 1992 album, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> slapped since he destroyed his Music Man StingRay bass in the mid '90's. This coincides with his decision to switch to Fender Jazz basses, therefore not using the slapping technique anymore.|$|E
2500|$|Little {{is known}} about his early life. [...] He was born in Barges. [...] Like many of his countrymen, he {{received}} a good musical education in the Low Countries, and either in youth or early adulthood came to Italy, where employment prospects for singers and composers were better than at home. [...] By 1550 he had become maestro di cappella (choirmaster) at the church of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari (known as the Ca' Grande) in Venice, a prestigious post. [...] He left Venice in 1555, going to Treviso, where he became a Franciscan and joined the convent of San Francesco. [...] Further records {{show that he was}} employed at Treviso Cathedral between 1562 and 1565 as maestro di cappella. [...] No further records of his life have yet been found, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> yet been the subject of a dedicated scholarly biography.|$|E
2500|$|... "As {{long as he}} had his mistresses, {{things were}} better, but since the last one was exiled because she allowed herself to be insolent towards the King, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> {{provided}} himself with a new one, his temperament has grown worse, and I have daily been subjected to outbursts because of this, which has occurred even {{in front of the}} staff. This hostility have increased so much during the winter that I have reached the end of my patience." [...] She expressed her view upon love and sexuality and when Gustav III studied certain letters after his late mother in the company of others, as they contained information regarding the alleged love affair between his mother Queen Louisa Ulrika av Count Carl Gustaf Tessin, and the complaints from Adolf Frederick, King of Sweden over the attention Tessin gave his consort:" [...] It is undoubtedly so, that these papers can give reason for reflection; it does lead me to consider how easily a poor woman is judged and how unfortunate it is to have a heart filled with emotion, for a tender nature is a misfortune as well as a blessing, and no human can resist the power of love, even though friendship must at times be the comfort for the wise one, yes, nothing is more true than the inscription who were once placed upon the image of God of Love: 'Eho you are, her is your true master, he has been, he is and always will be.' You have to admit, my dear friend, that woman is truly an unhappy creature: while men have their complete freedom, she is always burdened by prejudice and circumstance; you may say, that men also have that hindrance, but it is not in equal degree. I am convinced that most women would ask for nothing more than to be transformed to men to escape the unhappy bondage and enjoy their full freedom." ...|$|E
60|$|She stood a moment, {{expecting a}} reply. But Donatello's eyes had again fallen on the ground, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not,</b> in his bewildered mind and {{overburdened}} heart, {{a word to}} respond.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} or two Kit hesitated. Mrs. Austin was Olivia's sister <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> meant to talk about Betty. Sometimes he did talk when he ought to be quiet.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> heard a sound, either, all day {{but that}} one now of his own muttering voice. It had been a day of {{absolute}} silence--the first <b>he</b> <b>had</b> known in his life. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> slept a wink. Not for all these wakeful nights and the days of fighting, planning, talking; not for all that last night of danger and hard physical toil upon the gulf, <b>had</b> <b>he</b> been able to close {{his eyes for a}} moment. And yet from sunrise to sunset <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been lying prone on the ground, either on his back or on his face.|$|R
