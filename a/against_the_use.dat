5|$|Because of {{increasing}} Muslim resentment <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> {{of the mosque}} as a military garrison, the British set up the Badshahi Mosque Authority in 1852 to oversee the restoration and to re-establish it {{as a place of}} religious worship. From then onwards, piecemeal repairs were carried out {{under the supervision of the}} Badshahi Mosque Authority. The building was officially handed back to the Muslim community by John Lawrence, who was the Viceroy of India. The building was then re-established as a mosque.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the most}} widely used vaccine worldwide, with more than 90% of all {{children}} being vaccinated. The immunity it induces decreases after about ten years. As tuberculosis is uncommon in most of Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, BCG is administered to only those people at high risk. Part of the reasoning <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of the vaccine is that it makes the tuberculin skin test falsely positive, reducing the test's use in screening. A number of new vaccines are currently in development.|$|E
5|$|A demon {{comes to}} steal the ring from Thalaba, but he is stopped by the young boy. This allows Thalaba to demand {{information}} about the sorcerers and why his family was killed. Time passes and Thalaba settles into a pastoral life at Irem and plans to marry Moath's daughter, Oneiza. However, Thalaba decides that his duty prohibits him from such actions, and he leaves to fulfill his destiny. However, the sorcerer Lobaba tricks Thalaba and tries {{to steal the}} ring. After many failed attempts, Lobaba tries to convince Thalaba to harness the ring's magic power, which would bring Thalaba harm. Instead, Thalaba argues <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of magic in general and realises that Lobaba is evil. Although Thalaba attempts to kill Lobaba and fails by the sorcerer's magic, a storm comes and destroys the sorcerer.|$|E

5|$|D'Eyncourt, who had {{departed}} Brazil in October {{immediately after the}} contract was signed, returned in March 1911 to display the various design options available to the Brazilian Navy. Armstrong evidently thought the second faction would prevail, so he also took with him everything needed to close a deal on Bacellar's design. By mid-March, Armstrong's contacts in Brazil reported that Leão had convinced the recently elected President Hermes Rodrigues da Fonseca to cancel the design with twelve 14-inch guns {{in favor of a}} smaller ship. The credit may not have laid with Leão alone, though; da Fonseca was already dealing with multiple issues. Most importantly, he {{had to deal with the}} fallout from a large naval revolt in November 1910 (the Revolt of the Lash), which had seen three of the new vessels just purchased by the navy, along with one older coast-defense ship, mutiny <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of corporal punishment in the navy.|$|E
5|$|Godwin is {{generally}} regarded as {{the founder of the}} school of thought known as 'philosophical anarchism'. He argued in Political Justice (1793) that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society, and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, at {{the annual}} meeting of the American Association for the Study and Prevention of Infant Mortality, DeLee spoke out <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of {{midwives}} for childbirth. DeLee said that midwives stunted the progress of the obsetrical profession and said that he refused to take part in the education of a provider that lowered the standards of the profession. If obstetrics were seen as dignified work that could draw more than the menial fees charged by midwives, DeLee said, many young physicians would be willing to deliver the patients that were then under the care of midwives.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, a Montreal anti-cult {{organization}} called Info-Cult made statements against the Raëlian Church with {{an article on}} Le Devoir, branding Raëlians as promoters of fascism and racism, due to the church's use of the swastika {{as part of their}} logo and the Raëlian description of an extraterrestrial global government in which those less than ten percent above average intelligence are excluded from the electorate. Outside Info-Cult's office, Raëlians spoke against the act of discriminating against a religious minority. On 2 January 1992, a dozen people protested <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of the swastika in the Raëlian logo in Miami's Eden Roc Hotel. The use of the swastika and other Raelian practices has led to criticism from the group Hineni of Florida, an Orthodox Jewish organization.|$|E

The manufacturer advises <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of linezolid for community-acquired pneumonia or uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections caused by MRSA.

5|$|Outside urban areas, the redback is {{more often}} found in drier {{habitats}} ranging from sclerophyll forest to desert, even as harsh as the Simpson Desert. It became much more common in urban areas {{in the early decades}} of the 20th century, and is now found in all but the most inhospitable environments in Australia and its cities. It is particularly common in Brisbane, Perth and Alice Springs. The redback spider is commonly found in close proximity to human residences. Webs are usually built in dry, dark, sheltered sites, such as among rocks, in logs, tree hollows, shrubs, old tyres, sheds, outhouses, empty tins and boxes, children's toys or under rubbish or litter. Letterboxes and the undersurface of toilet seats are common sites. Populations can be controlled by clearing these habitats, squashing the spiders and their egg sacs, and using pesticide in outhouses. The CSIRO Division of Entomology recommends <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of spider pesticides due to their toxicity, and because redbacks are rapid recolonists anyway.|$|E
5|$|The Alversund Bridge was a toll bridge {{which was}} {{paying for the}} debt {{accumulated}} in its construction. By 1968, the debt would be paid off, but the Norwegian Public Roads Administration launched a plan whereby the tolls {{would continue to be}} collected and used to finance a bridge across Salhusfjorden. This was opposed by a group of locals, who brought the issue to the courts, claiming it to be illegal, as a bridge would never be built. Both Oslo District Court and Eidsivating Court of Appeal concluded that the tolls were legal, and the issue was rejected by the Supreme Court. Protests were also raised <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of a pontoon bridge, as it would limit the vessel size and thus the commercial development in the inner parts of the fjord.|$|E
5|$|Uncomplicated infections can be {{diagnosed}} and treated based on symptoms alone. Antibiotics taken by mouth such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin are typically first line. Cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or a fluoroquinolone {{may also be}} used. However, resistance to fluoroquinolones among the bacterial that cause urinary infections has been increasing. The FDA recommends <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects. These medications substantially shorten the time to recovery with all being equally effective. A three-day treatment with trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a fluoroquinolone is usually sufficient, whereas nitrofurantoin requires 5–7days. Fosfomycin {{may be used as}} a single dose but has been associated with lower rates of efficacy.|$|E
