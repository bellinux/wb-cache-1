5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coins {{bear the}} name of a moneyer, there is no {{indication}} of the mint where each coin was struck. As a result, the number and location of mints used by Offa is uncertain. Current opinion is that there were four mints, in Canterbury, Rochester, East Anglia and London.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first-season cast {{were set}} to return, the {{producers}} had {{a large number of}} new characters to cast for the second season. Due to this, Benioff and Weiss postponed the introduction of several key characters and merged several characters into one or assigned plot functions to different characters.|$|E
5|$|Since the deindustrialisation of {{the region}} in the mid-20th century, these {{industries}} have been replaced by newer sectors and industries, <b>although</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> civic developments that accompanied industrialisation remain in the form of public buildings; a town hall, public baths and library. The few surviving cotton mills are now occupied by warehousing and distribution companies, or used as space for light industry.|$|E

5|$|The closest major {{relative}} of Tamil is Malayalam; the two began diverging around the 9th century AD. <b>Although</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> differences between Tamil and Malayalam demonstrate a pre-historic split {{of the western}} dialect, the process of separation into a distinct language, Malayalam, was not completed until sometime in the 13th or 14th century.|$|E
5|$|Unlike birds, {{many small}} insects are swept {{along by the}} {{prevailing}} winds <b>although</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larger insects are known to make migrations. Aphids {{are known to be}} transported long distances by low-level jet streams. As such, fine line patterns associated with converging winds within weather radar imagery, like the WSR-88D radar network, often represent large groups of insects.|$|E
5|$|Almost all {{undergraduates}} attend full-time. A {{majority of}} undergraduates, 76%, live on-campus in several dormitories and apartment complexes, including all underclassmen. , 1255 undergraduates and 339 graduate students live off-campus, {{mostly in the}} Georgetown, Glover Park, Burleith, and Foxhall neighborhoods. <b>Although</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> university's hall directors and area coordinators attend graduate level courses, on-campus housing is not available for main campus graduate students. The school hopes to build such housing by 2020. All students in the Medical School live off-campus, most in the surrounding neighborhoods, with some in Northern Virginia and elsewhere through the region.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> afore-mentioned inhibitors {{share the}} same Hsp90 binding site (either N- or C-terminal), {{it has been shown}} that some of these drugs {{preferentially}} access distinct Hsp90 populations, which are differentiated by the extent of their post-translational modification. Though no published inhibitor has yet to distinguish between Hsp90A and Hsp90B, a recent study has shown that phosphorylation of a particular residue in the Hsp90 N-terminus can provide isoform specificity to inhibitor binding., thus providing an additional level of regulation for optimal Hsp90 targeting.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band's albums {{have been}} {{underground}} hits, they never found larger commercial success. The band were released from their recording contract with Warner Bros. Records when Warner's imprint Elektra Records folded. The release was reportedly due to poor record sales, {{and since then}} Stereolab's self-owned label, Duophonic Records, has signed a distribution deal with Too Pure. Duophonic holds the copyrights to the band's recordings, and on this label the band has released many limited-edition records. In 2009, Stereolab announced via their website {{that they were going}} on indefinite hiatus.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{time was}} {{on the side of}} the defenders; most armies could not afford to wait out the {{prosecution}} of a siege, especially of a well-fortified, well-provisioned city. Until the invention of gunpowder-based weapons (and the resulting higher-velocity projectiles), the balance of power and logistics definitely favored the defender. With the introduction of large-caliber mortars and howitzers (in modern times), the traditional methods of defense became less effective against a determined siege, <b>although</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trace italienne fortresses presented a formidable challenge well into the twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|Golden Sun is a {{contemporary}} {{presentation of the}} traditional role-playing video game formula, in which the player controls a cast of four characters as they journey through a fantasy-themed world, interact with other characters, battle monsters, acquire increasingly powerful abilities and equipment, and take part in an ongoing narrative. <b>Although</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> player's actions are compulsory, Golden Sun often allows the player to visit previous locations and complete certain objectives out of order.|$|E
5|$|Not all Texans favored secession initially, <b>although</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same {{would later}} support the Southern cause. Texas's most notable Unionist {{was the state}} Governor, Sam Houston. Not wanting to {{aggravate}} the situation, Houston refused two offers from President Lincoln for Union troops {{to keep him in}} office. After refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy, Houston was deposed as governor.|$|E
5|$|Sale's built {{environment}} is varied, {{with a mixture}} of modern and old buildings. Some terraces, semi-detached houses and villas, survive from the Victorian period, <b>although</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larger houses have been converted into flats. Many semi-detached houses survive from the 1930s, when there was a need for new housing in the town {{as a result of a}} growing population and an increasingly wealthy middle class. Interspersed with these older structures are newer housing developments, such as the estates built in Ashton upon Mersey and the east of Sale during the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Separate grounds at Pontnewydd and Croesyceiliog {{house the}} town's two rugby teams, Cwmbran RFC and Croesyceiliog RFC, <b>although</b> <b>many</b> more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town's {{residents}} support <b>the</b> rugby teams <b>of</b> <b>the</b> older, adjacent town <b>of</b> Pontypool, <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Newport and <b>the</b> Newport Gwent Dragons regional team.|$|R
50|$|<b>Although</b> {{retaining}} <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{technical characteristics}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anti-tank rifles, the Cold War era weapons are only conceptual descendants of anti-tank weapons wielded by the Second World War infantry, and both large-calibre sniper rifles and anti-materiel rifles owe only {{some part of}} their design heritage to them.|$|R

5|$|The {{market place}} at the centre of Poulton is the width of two streets and is now closed to motor traffic. Lying south of St Chad's Church and {{surrounded}} by shops, the square contains the town's war memorial {{as well as a}} market cross, stocks, whipping post and fish slabs, from which fish were sold on market days. <b>Although</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buildings surrounding the market place were rebuilt following a fire in the 18thcentury, a few of the earlier buildings remain. To the south of the market place are town houses that were built for local merchants and professionals.|$|E
5|$|The scheme did {{not meet}} with {{universal}} enthusiasm, and from the beginning, there were some who doubted the true intentions of the promoters. <b>Although</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sinuous curves and deviations were due to having to maintain a 1 in 50 gradient {{where there was no}} leeway (most observers being oblivious to the fact that a straighter shorter line would have made the gradient even steeper), several were due to resistance by local landowners along the route.|$|E
5|$|After Christmas {{leave the}} company {{concentrated}} at Balcombe in Victoria {{where it was}} officially disbanded on 20 April 1945, <b>although</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> men continued to serve in other signals units {{until the end of}} the war. Although complete records were unable to be maintained, a nominal roll of the unit lists the names of approximately 792 men that served in the NGAWW. During its service, the unit lost eight men killed in action, while another three died of other causes while on active service. The company had the distinction of being Australia's most highly decorated signals unit of World War II, with its members receiving one Member of the Order of the British Empire, ten Military Medals, and ten Mentions in Despatches. Numerous Commendation Cards were also awarded by the Commander-In-Chief. Flight Lieutenant Leigh Vial (then an RAAF pilot officer working as a Coastwatcher) was also awarded the US Distinguished Service Cross for service behind the lines around Salamaua during a joint mission with NGAWW personnel.|$|E

5|$|By 17:35, Sydney {{was heading}} south and losing speed, wreathed in smoke from {{multiple}} fires. Her main armament was disabled (the two aft turrets had jammed on a port facing {{and could not}} be swung around), and her secondary guns were out of effective range. The cruiser continued to be hit by shells from Kormorans aft guns as the distance between the ships increased. The Germans reported that around 17:45, all four torpedoes from Sydneys starboard launcher were fired, but as Kormoran was manoeuvring to bring her port broadside to bear, they all missed. In fact, only two torpedoes from Sydneys port launcher were ever fired, which must have happened some time earlier. The raider's engines broke down after this turn, but she continued to fire on Sydney at a high rate despite being immobilised, <b>although</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shells would have missed as the distance between the two ships increased. Kormoran ceased fire at 17:50, with the range at , and launched another torpedo at 18:00, but missed Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Claims {{that the}} NEP had retarded {{economic}} growth were dismissed; it was posited that the NEP {{had managed to}} avert further racial rioting, which would have hurt economic growth more than the NEP. The NEP was also defended as having created a Malay middle class and improving standards of living without compromising the non-Bumiputra share {{of the economy in}} absolute terms; statistics indicated that the Chinese and Indian middle classes also grew under the NEP, albeit not as much as the Malays'. The overall Malaysian poverty rate had shrunk from 50% at independence to 7%. It was also argued that ethnic stereotypes had been largely stamped out due to the NEP's success in creating a Malay upper class. <b>Although</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NEP's goals were restated by the NDP, the new policy appeared to be geared more towards wealth retention and creation, as opposed to simple redistribution. Nevertheless, many of the policies from the NEP era were retained under the NDP, which was set to expire in 2020.|$|E
5|$|Howard was an All-American {{center and}} an honors student at Chicago Vocational Career Academy. Michigan {{was able to}} sign him early over {{numerous}} competing offers and then convince others in his recruiting class to join him. The Fab Five, which included Chris Webber, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King and Ray Jackson, served as regular starters during their freshman and sophomore years for the 1991–92 and 1992–93 Wolverines. Howard was the last member of the Fab Five to remain active as a professional basketball player. <b>Although</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wolverines' accomplishments from 1992 to 1998 were forfeited due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal, which involved booster payments to players to launder money from illegal gambling, Howard's 1993–94 All-American season continues to be recognized.|$|E
50|$|In later times, the cap {{had lost}} its popular and {{political}} appeal. <b>Although</b> <b>many</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Congress party continued the tradition, rival political parties preferred to dissociate themselves from the tradition linked with the Congress. <b>The</b> mass acceptance <b>of</b> Western-style clothing had also diminished <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> wearing Indian-style clothes for politicians.|$|R
