5|$|The Khazars {{themselves}} first campaigned in the Caucasus {{during the}} Byzantine–Sassanid War of 602–628, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> of the Western Turkic Khaganate. The Turks sacked Derbent {{and joined the}} Byzantines in their siege of Tiflis. Their contribution proved decisive for the eventual Byzantine victory in the war. For a few years afterwards, until ca. 632, the Khazars exercised some control over Caucasian Iberia (approximately modern Georgia), Caucasian Albania (modern Republic of Azerbaijan) and Adharbayjan (modern Iranian Azerbaijan).|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} {{been a number of}} {{translations}} which aim to present the Gododdin as literature rather than <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> of scholarly study.

5|$|A {{somewhat}} controversial recent {{addition to}} Caversham was the opening, in October 2013, of Whakamana Cannabis Museum, New Zealand's first museum {{dedicated to the}} history of cannabis use. Cannabis, while still a criminalised drug in New Zealand, has moved some way towards grudging acceptance, at least <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> for open discussion. The museum, run from a former residential house in David Street, is designed to be an information centre on aspects of the history and legislation surrounding the drug, and also a national centre for the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party, a minor single-issue political party.|$|E

5|$|Another {{possibility}} {{was suggested}} by Brooks: Penda might have lost power {{at some point}} after Heavenfield, and Eowa may have actually been ruling the Mercians {{for at least some}} of the period <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> ally or puppet of Oswald. Brooks cited Bede's statement implying that Penda's fortunes were mixed during his 22 years in power and noted the possibility that Penda's fortunes were low at this time. Thus it may be that Penda was not consistently the dominant figure in Mercia during the years between Hatfield and Maserfield. argues against the idea that Penda and Eowa were co-rulers, and favours the idea that Eowa was ruling Mercia from c. 635 until 642.|$|E
5|$|Brushstrokes {{series is}} the name {{for a series of}} {{paintings}} produced in 196566 by Roy Lichtenstein. It also refers to derivative sculptural representations of these paintings that were first made in the 1980s. In the series, the theme is art <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject,</b> but rather than reproduce masterpieces as he had starting in 1962, Lichtenstein depicted the gestural expressions of the painting brushstroke itself. The works in this series are linked to those produced by artists who use the gestural painting style of abstract expressionism made famous by Jackson Pollock, but differ from them due to their mechanically produced appearance. The series is considered a satire or parody of gestural painting by both Lichtenstein and his critics. After 1966, Lichtenstein incorporated this series into later motifs and themes of his work.|$|E
5|$|Dian was conquered {{during a}} {{military}} campaign launched by Han Wudi in 109 BCE, and the Yizhou commandery {{was established in}} the former kingdom. Archaeologists discovered the king of Dian's imperial seal inscribed by the Han, confirming Dian's surrender and status <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> of the Han. The Dian led a series of unsuccessful rebellions against Han rule, beginning with two revolts in 86 BCE and 83 BCE. Chen Li, governor of the Zangge commandery, crushed a rebellion in 28–35 BCE. Under Wang Mang's reign as usurper of the Han throne between 9-23 CE, hostilities in southwestern China persisted. Wang sent military campaigns to quell the unrest. Seventy percent of the soldiers in one campaign died from illness. Another campaign, comprising 100,000 men and with double the supplies, was not fruitful. Rebellions continued in 42-45 and 176.|$|E

25|$|Although the Christian Brothers have {{departed}} the faculty, Religious Education {{is still}} taught.

5|$|For Key Stage 3 pupils, the {{curriculum}} comprises English, mathematics, science, technology, a modern foreign language, art, Information and Communications Technology (ICT), geography, history, religious education (RE), physical education (PE), {{and a life}} skills programme, incorporating citizenship, {{sex and relationships education}} and personal and social education. The school offers French, Spanish and German as foreign languages and, in Year 8, pupils take a second language to supplement the one studied in Year 7. The use of ICT is central to all teaching and is taught <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> in Key Stage 3.|$|E
5|$|Godwin's books {{begin to}} {{incorporate}} religious themes starting with Father Melancholy's Daughter (1991). The novel is told {{from the perspective}} of multiple characters, each of whom have a different perspective on religion. Father Melancholy's Daughter was followed by several books that centered on the Episcopal church and Christian practices. In these novels female and male characters have a more equal influence on the events and plot than in prior novels. Godwin's books neither evangelize nor mock the practices of the Episcopal Church, but rather treat it as a routine aspect of life, or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> of intellectual interest. During these years Godwin's books continued to show father figures who have died or are absent. By 1996 two of her books had fathers that died and five had stepfathers that are depicted as intruding on the mother-daughter relationship.|$|E
5|$|Guo Xiaoke, who had led {{the first}} Tang {{campaign}} against Karasahr in 644, was installed in Kucha as protector-general of the Anxi Protectorate, or the Protectorate of the Pacified West. The headquarters of the protector-general was thus moved from its original location in Gaochang to Kucha. While Ashina was {{in pursuit of the}} Kuchean king, Nali, a Kuchean lord, traveled to request the help of the Western Turks. Guo was assassinated after the Kuchean soldiers retook the kingdom with the military assistance of the Western Turks. Ashina returned to Kucha, captured five of the kingdom's cities, and forced the remaining cities to surrender. Tang control was re-established in the oasis state. The brother of the former king, a yabgu or viceroy, was enthroned by the Chinese <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> of the Tang empire.|$|E

5|$|In {{the context}} of Anglophone music, the term Antillean music most {{commonly}} refers to Trinidad and Tobago, home to the well-known calypso style. Music author Peter Manuel, for example, treats all the Anglophone islands <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> of Trinidadian calypso traditions, while using the title Music of the Lesser Antilles for Francophone Antillean music. Manuel also, like many authors, treats Suriname and Guyana as integral aspects of Caribbean music; due to the Dutch colonial history of both countries, they are often grouped with Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles.|$|E
5|$|The play {{originated}} as Enright's A Property of the Clan, a theatre-in-education piece {{written for}} Freewheels Theatre in Education in Newcastle which premiered in 1992. Enright {{was approached by}} the director of Freewheels, Brian Joyce, who suggested the murder of Leigh Leigh <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> for a play. Enright initially refused, but Joyce argued that the actual subject of the play would be the victim's peer-groups. Enright agreed, after being convinced a play could be made out of the conflicting responses to the crime. The title was taken from a quote in the psychological report that was made on Mathew Webster, the man who murdered Leigh, in preparation for his trial. The first decision regarding the play was to omit the criminal acts and the actual murder from it, instead focusing on the drama, its participants and {{the aftermath of the}} murder.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, {{the school}} follows the National Curriculum in years 7–11 {{and offers a}} range of GCSEs (national exams taken by {{students}} aged 14–16) and A-levels (national exams taken by pupils aged 16–18). The school has no affiliation with a particular religious denomination, but religious education is given throughout the school, and boys may opt to take the subject {{as part of their}} GCSE course. Although morning assemblies take place and are Christian in nature, they are non-denominational. Students participate in a number of educational visits and excursions throughout their school career and year 11 students are offered the opportunity to participate in a work experience programme. The curriculum comprises English and drama, mathematics, French, history, geography, science, art, music, design and technology, information communications technology (I.C.T.), ethics and philosophy (religious education), physical education (P.E.), cookery, and citizenship, sex and relationships education; in Key Stage 4 (years 10 and 11), pupils also participate in careers and work-related learning. In mathematics, students are divided by their ability into two bands. Science is divided into Biology, Chemistry and Physics in year 9. In the second year German or Spanish is added. The use of information technology is central to all teaching and is taught <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> in Key Stage 3; in year 9, all students study for the European Computer Driving Licence, a level 2 course in I.C.T. and pupils may opt to take Computing as a GCSE.|$|E

5|$|History {{is often}} {{analyzed}} with contemporary ideologies; Ancient Greece <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> enjoyed popularity {{by the ruling}} class in Britain during the 19th century. Based on their social priorities, British scholars interpreted ancient Greece as a westernized, white, and masculine society, and essentially removed women from historical importance. Women in Greece were sequestered with each other, and men with men. In this homosocial environment, erotic and sexual relationships between males were common and recorded in literature, art, and philosophy. Hardly anything is recorded about homosexual activity between women. There is some speculation that similar relationships existed between women and girls. The poet Alcman used the term aitis, as the feminine form of aites—which was the official term for the younger participant in a pederastic relationship. Aristophanes, in Plato's Symposium, mentions women who love women, but uses the term trepesthai (to be focused on) instead of eros, which was applied to other erotic relationships between men, and between men and women.|$|E
5|$|In September 1523, Leo Jud, Zwingli's {{closest friend}} and {{colleague}} and pastor of St. Peterskirche, publicly called {{for the removal of}} statues of saints and other icons. This led to demonstrations and iconoclastic activities. The city council decided to work out the matter of images in a second disputation. The essence of the mass and its sacrificial character was also included <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> of discussion. Supporters of the mass claimed that the eucharist was a true sacrifice, while Zwingli claimed that it was a commemorative meal. As in the first disputation, an invitation was sent out to the Zurich clergy and the bishop of Constance. This time, however, the lay people of Zurich, the dioceses of Chur and Basel, the University of Basel, and the twelve members of the Confederation were also invited. About nine hundred persons attended this meeting, but neither the bishop nor the Confederation sent representatives. The disputation started on 26 October 1523 and lasted two days.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} what {{happened}} to the island's Christians after the Muslim conquest; the traditional view is that most were either converted or expelled. There is evidence from Muslim sources, however, for the continued survival of Christians on Crete, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> class, as in other Muslim conquests, although according to the same sources the Muslims, whether descendants of the Andalusians, more recent migrants, or converts (or any combination of these) formed the majority. There is also evidence of rival classes on the island as when Theodosius the Deacon reports that the rural Cretans, not rulers of the land but inhabitants of crags and caves, descended from the mountains under their leader Karamountes during the siege of Chandax by Nikephoros Phokas to assist the besieged. It seems that the Byzantine Christian population of the countryside was left relatively alone, while the Muslim element (including native converts) predominated in the cities.|$|E
