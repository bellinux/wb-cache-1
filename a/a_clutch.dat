5|$|<b>A</b> <b>clutch</b> {{consists}} of 2 to 5 light green-grey eggs with darker spots. The mean clutch sizes of grey jays in Algonquin Provincial Park and La Verendrye Provincial Park were 3.03 and 3.18 eggs, respectively. Incubation is performed {{only by the}} female and lasts an average of 18.5 days. The female is fed on the nest by her partner, rarely moving from the nest during incubation and for several days after hatching.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> wet <b>clutch</b> is {{immersed}} in a cooling lubricating fluid that also keeps surfaces clean and provides smoother performance and longer life. Wet clutches, however, tend to lose some energy to the liquid. Since the surfaces of <b>a</b> wet <b>clutch</b> can be slippery (as with <b>a</b> motorcycle <b>clutch</b> bathed in engine oil), stacking multiple clutch discs can compensate for the lower coefficient of friction and so eliminate slippage under power when fully engaged.The Hele-Shaw <b>clutch</b> was <b>a</b> wet <b>clutch</b> that relied entirely on viscous effects, rather than on friction.|$|R
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>clutch</b> {{consists}} of three to five light-blue eggs, and is incubated by the female alone. The eggs hatch after 14days, and the chicks leave the nest a further two weeks later. The altricial chicks are naked and have their eyes closed {{for the first few}} days after hatching. While the chicks are still young, the mother broods them continuously. When they are older, the mother will brood them only at night or during bad weather.|$|E
5|$|On January 17, 2011, Roy {{underwent}} {{arthroscopic surgery}} {{on both of}} his knees. He returned to the lineup on February 25, scoring 18 points off the bench, including <b>a</b> <b>clutch</b> three-pointer to force overtime, and helping the Blazers win the game 107–106. Roy then took on a reserve role {{for the rest of}} the season, scoring inconsistently to finish with a career-low season average of 12.2 points, 2.6 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 28 minutes in 47 games.|$|E
5|$|Some redback {{males have}} been {{observed}} using an alternative tactic that also ensures more of their genetic material is passed on. Juvenile female redbacks nearing their final moulting and adulthood have fully formed reproductive organs, but lack openings in the exoskeleton that allow access to the organs. Males will bite through the exoskeleton and deliver sperm without performing the somersault seen in males mating with adult females. The females then moult {{within a few days}} and deliver <b>a</b> <b>clutch</b> of fertilised eggs.|$|E

5|$|The club's first {{experience}} of Europe came in 1966–67 season when, helped by <b>a</b> <b>clutch</b> of Scandinavian players, United defeated Inter-Cities Fairs Cup holders FC Barcelona both home and away. Although Juventus proved too {{strong in the}} next round with a 3–1 aggregate victory, United made headlines {{and were asked to}} compete as Dallas Tornado in the United Soccer Association league in North America during the summer of 1967.|$|E
5|$|The {{young of}} <b>a</b> <b>clutch</b> hatch over {{two or three}} days and are brooded until their {{feathers}} develop and eyes open five days after hatching. The young are fed on insects until they fledge 16 to 25, typically 17, days after hatching. After this they are fed for one or two weeks. While feeding nestlings, the female is dominant over the male. Cape sparrows are among the main hosts of brood parasitism by the dideric cuckoo in southern Africa, and sometimes parasitise nests of their own species.|$|E
5|$|Two {{or three}} oval white eggs, laid {{two to three}} days apart, are most {{commonly}} laid in <b>a</b> <b>clutch,</b> though there can be anywhere from one to five. They average 41.6mm long by 35.5mm wide, and are finely pitted. The female alone incubates the eggs, during which time she is fed by the male. She does leave the nest at dusk for around half an hour, sometimes to bathe. Incubation takes 30–31 days.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the name}} implies, <b>a</b> cone <b>clutch</b> has conical {{friction}} surfaces. The cone's taper {{means that a}} given amount of movement of the actuator makes the surfaces approach (or recede) much more slowly than in <b>a</b> disc <b>clutch.</b> <b>As</b> well, a given amount of actuating force creates more pressure on the mating surfaces.The best known example of <b>a</b> cone <b>clutch</b> is <b>a</b> synchronizer ring in a manual transmission.

5|$|A prototypical late bloomer, Johnson overcame early {{struggles and}} had a {{successful}} NBA playing career. Drafted 29th overall in 1976 by the Seattle SuperSonics, Johnson began his professional career as a shooting guard. He eventually led the Sonics to their only NBA championship in 1979, winning the Finals MVP Award. After a short stint with the Phoenix Suns, he became the starting point guard for the Boston Celtics, with whom he won two more championships. Johnson was voted into five All-Star Teams, one All-NBA First and one Second Team, and nine consecutive All-Defensive First and Second Teams. Apart from {{his reputation as a}} defensive stopper, Johnson was known as <b>a</b> <b>clutch</b> player who made several decisive plays in NBA playoffs history.|$|E
5|$|Christie (Gary Dourdan), an adept mercenary, is second-in-command of the Betty. After Call is apprehended and {{the crew}} rounded up for execution, Christie uses his hidden pair of pistols to shoot {{them out of their}} situation. When the crew goes underwater, Christie {{harnesses}} Vriess to his back and swims to the opening (which puts them in the middle of <b>a</b> <b>clutch</b> of Alien eggs). Fleeing from the attacking Aliens, Christie is injured and his foot is snagged by an Alien. He saves Vriess by detaching himself, allowing Christie to fall into the water below, sacrificing himself.|$|E
5|$|Laying {{takes place}} in September and October. <b>A</b> <b>clutch</b> {{of four or five}} white and {{slightly}} shiny eggs, measuring 30 x 24mm, is laid. The incubation period has been recorded as anywhere from 19 to 23 days, with the female performing this duty alone. Newly hatched chicks are covered with long white down, and are largely helpless (nidicolous). They leave the nest four to five weeks after hatching and join up with other young birds in flocks, though rely on their parents for food for another fortnight after fledging.|$|E

5|$|McNamara showed {{early on}} that he was <b>a</b> <b>clutch</b> performer, nailing a game-winning 3-pointer as then-No. 17 Syracuse notched an 82-80 win over then-No. 10 Notre Dame in February. In a March game at Georgetown, McNamara missed a free-throw with 10 seconds left that allowed the Hoyas to force {{overtime}}. Until that point, McNamara had been a perfect 41-for-41 in conference play. However, McNamara made up for his miss, hitting two 3-pointers and adding another jumper in an 11-3 run to start overtime as Syracuse beat Mike Sweetney and the Georgetown Hoyas, 93-84. Ten of McNamara's 22 came in the extra frame.|$|E
5|$|Olajuwon {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as <b>a</b> <b>clutch</b> performer and also {{as one of the}} top centers in history based on his performances in the 1993–94 and 1994–95 seasons. He outplayed centers such as Patrick Ewing, David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, and Dikembe Mutombo, and other defensive stalwarts such as Dennis Rodman and Karl Malone. Many of his battles were with his fellow Texas-based rival David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs. In the 30 head–to–head match-ups during the seven seasons from the 1989 to 1996, when both Olajuwon and Robinson were in their prime, Olajuwon averaged 26.3 points per game, shooting 47.6% from the field, while Robinson averaged 22.1 and 46.8%.|$|E
5|$|Still, playoff {{failures}} and Butch Carter's media altercations surrounding Camby led Grunwald to replace Carter {{prior to the}} 2000–01 season with Lenny Wilkens, a Hall of Fame coach and player with more than 30 years of coaching experience. The team roster was also largely revamped, including the signing of veteran playmaker Mark Jackson on a four-year contract. When Alvin Williams later emerged as <b>a</b> <b>clutch</b> performer, Jackson was traded to allow Williams more playing time. In the 2000 off-season, free agent McGrady opted to leave the Raptors in a sign-and-trade deal worth $67.5 million over six years, while giving a conditional draft pick {{as part of the}} agreement to the Orlando Magic, for a first-round draft pick.|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is directed}} to <b>a</b> mechanical <b>clutch</b> which limits transmission of torque to a desired, predetermined maximum torque from <b>a</b> first <b>clutch</b> plate to <b>a</b> second <b>clutch</b> plate. More specifically, the mechanical clutch includes at least one stepper member, preferably three or more evenly spaced stepper members, which transmit the torque from <b>a</b> first <b>clutch</b> plate to <b>a</b> second <b>clutch</b> plate providing <b>a</b> desired maximum torque is not exceeded. However, if the desired maximum torque is exceeded, the stepper member will rotate and move between the clutch plates so that the torque to the second clutch plate does not exceed the desired maximum torque. The desired maximum torque is set by the axial force compressing the stepper member between the clutch plates and when the applied torque to the first clutch plate exceeds the desired torque, the stepper member will rotate between the clutch plates rather than transmit that torque to the second clutch plate...|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} season, Russell {{scored a}} career-high 18.9 {{points per game}}, accompanied by 23.6 rebounds per game. While his rival Chamberlain had a record-breaking season of 50.4 points per game and a 100-point game, the Celtics became {{the first team to}} win 60 games in a season, and Russell was voted as the NBA's Most Valuable Player. In the post-season, the Celtics met the Philadelphia Warriors of Chamberlain, and Russell did his best to slow down the 50-points-per-game scoring Warriors center. In the pivotal Game 7, Russell managed to hold Chamberlain to only 22 points (28 below his season average) while scoring 19 himself. The game was tied with two seconds left when Sam Jones sank <b>a</b> <b>clutch</b> shot that won the Celtics the series. In the 1962 NBA Finals, the Celtics met the Los Angeles Lakers of star forward Elgin Baylor and star guard Jerry West. The teams split the first six games, and Game 7 was tied one second before the end of regular time when Lakers guard Rod Hundley faked a shot and instead passed out to Frank Selvy, who missed an open eight-foot last-second shot that would have won L.A. the title. Though the game was tied, Russell had the daunting task of defending against Baylor with little frontline help, as the three best Celtics forwards, Loscutoff, Heinsohn and Tom Sanders, had fouled out. In overtime, Baylor fouled out the fourth forward, Frank Ramsey, so Russell was completely robbed of his usual four-men wing rotation. But Russell and little-used fifth forward Gene Guarilia successfully pressured Baylor into missed shots. Russell finished with <b>a</b> <b>clutch</b> performance, scoring 30 points and tying his own NBA Finals record with 40 rebounds in a 110–107 overtime win.|$|E
5|$|This {{cockatoo}} usually lays <b>a</b> <b>clutch</b> {{of one to}} two eggs. It generally takes 28 to 29 {{days for}} the female to incubate the eggs, and the young fledge ten to eleven weeks after hatching. The young will stay with the family until the next breeding season, and sometimes even longer. The family leaves the nesting site after the young fledge until the following year. Carnaby's black cockatoo forms flocks when not breeding, with birds in drier habitats usually being more migratory than those in wetter ones. It flies with deep and slow wingbeats, generally high above trees. Seeds of plants of the families Proteaceae and, to a lesser extent, Myrtaceae form {{a large part of}} its diet.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days later}} against the New Jersey Nets, with the Heat down by {{two in the}} final seconds, Wade hit <b>a</b> <b>clutch</b> three-point shot, giving the Heat the win by one point, 81–80. On January 6, Wade scored a season-high 44 points in an {{overtime}} loss against the Boston Celtics, the most points scored by a player in a losing effort in the season until that point. On January 21, Wade was selected {{to play for the}} East in the 2010 NBA All-Star Game, which was his sixth overall All-Star appearance. Wade was named the game's MVP after recording 28 points, 11 assists, 5 steals and 6 rebounds.|$|E

50|$|Throughout its production, VW marketed the Beetle with a four-speed manual transmission. From 1961 (and almost {{exclusively}} in Europe), VW offered an optional version of the Saxomat semi-automatic transmission: a regular 4-speed manual transaxle coupled to <b>an</b> electromagnetic <b>clutch</b> with <b>a</b> centrifugal <b>clutch</b> used for idle. Subsequently, (beginning in 1967 in Europe and 1968 in the United States), VW offered an optional semi-automatic transmission (marketed as Automatic Stick Shift and also called AutoStick), which was a 3-speed manual coupled to <b>an</b> electro-pneumatic <b>clutch</b> and torque converter.|$|R
