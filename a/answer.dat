5|$|After the {{contestant}} decides {{for which}} amount to play, the prize money is {{displayed on the}} gameboard. The contestant and chaser are presented with the same multiple choice question, and each locks in their <b>answer,</b> which cannot then be changed; the other has five seconds to <b>answer</b> after them, otherwise they are locked out and do not advance on the gameboard. For each question the contestant answers correctly, the prize money shown on the gameboard moves {{one step closer to}} the team bank. Similarly, the chaser moves one step closer to the contestant's prize money with each correct <b>answer.</b> Further questions are asked until the contestant reaches the end of the board (thus banking the prize money), or the chaser catches the contestant, eliminating them from the game. No movement is made by the contestant or the chaser if an incorrect <b>answer</b> is provided or if they are locked out by the time limit.|$|E
5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct <b>answer</b> moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to <b>answer</b> the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct <b>answer</b> pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect <b>answer</b> provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to <b>answer</b> questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E

5|$|Each round {{began with}} a toss-up {{physical}} challenge in which both teams competed, with the winning team receiving both initial control of the round, and money for their score. After the toss-up, the host began asking trivia questions of the team in control. Each correct <b>answer</b> earned a monetary award, and allowed the team to maintain control, while an incorrect <b>answer,</b> or failure to respond within approximately ten seconds turned control over to the opponents. However, the team could dare their opponents to <b>answer</b> the question, doubling its value; in response, the opponents could double dare for quadruple the original value. When the team in control was challenged to a double dare, they had to either <b>answer</b> or compete in a physical challenge. An incorrect <b>answer,</b> or not responding within approximately five seconds on a dare or double dare, awarded both control and the appropriate {{amount of money to}} the team that issued it. The second round played the same as the first, with question values doubled. On Double Dare and Super Sloppy Double Dare, a question was initially worth $10. On Family Double Dare and Double Dare 2000, a question was initially worth $25.|$|E

5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to <b>answer</b> general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each <b>answer</b> they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident {{about their ability to}} <b>answer</b> questions that are deemed to be hard but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E
