5|$|The {{lead role}} of Maria von Trapp {{in the new}} West End {{production}} of The Sound of Music, to be staged by <b>Andrew</b> <b>Lloyd</b> <b>Webber</b> and David Ian, was to be played by American actress Scarlett Johansson. Negotiations fell through, and after a four-year search for an actress to fill the role, it was revealed in November 2005 that Lloyd Webber had approached the BBC to allow the public to cast the role through a Popstars-style talent search, {{the first time that}} such a format had been used.|$|E
5|$|Warner Bros. {{purchased}} the film rights to The Phantom of the Opera in early 1989, granting <b>Andrew</b> <b>Lloyd</b> <b>Webber</b> total artistic control. Despite interest from A-list directors, Lloyd Webber and Warner Bros. instantly hired Joel Schumacher to direct; Lloyd Webber had been impressed with Schumacher's use {{of music in}} The Lost Boys. The duo wrote the screenplay that same year, while Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman were cast to reprise their roles from the original stage production. Filming was set to begin at Pinewood Studios in England in July 1990, under a $25 million budget.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, under Sheridan's management, the {{building}} was demolished {{to make way for}} a larger theatre which opened in 1794. This new Drury Lane survived for 15 years before burning down in 1809. The building that stands today opened in 1812. It has been the residency of a number of well known actors including; Edmund Kean, comedian Dan Leno, and the musical composer and performer Ivor Novello. From the Second World War, the theatre has primarily hosted long runs of musicals, including Oklahoma! (1947–1953), My Fair Lady (1958–1963), 42nd Street (1984–1989) and Miss Saigon (1989–1999), the theatre's longest-running show. The theatre is owned by the composer <b>Andrew</b> <b>Lloyd</b> <b>Webber.</b>|$|E

5|$|Antichrist Superstar is a rock opera concept album, and {{its title}} {{is based on}} the 1971 <b>Andrew</b> <b>Lloyd</b> <b>Webber</b> musical Jesus Christ Superstar. It is {{primarily}} an industrial metal record, and contains material which has been described as industrial rock and death metal, as well as progressive metal, new wave and gothic rock. The album's central storyline revolves around a supernatural being who seizes power in order to initiate an apocalyptic end event. The record is a social critique which utilizes this premise {{as a metaphor for the}} fascist elements of the Christian right in North America. The band's frontman has said that the underlying concept of Antichrist Superstar was both inspired by and a tribute to the work of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, specifically his philosophical concept of an Übermensch.|$|E
5|$|Musicals {{continued}} to dominate at the theatre in the post-Second World War period, including transfers {{of the successful}} Broadway productions Follow the Girls (1945; 572 performances) and the Lerner and Loewe musicals Brigadoon (1949; 685 performances) and Paint Your Wagon (1953; 478 performances). Leonard Bernstein's West Side Story opened in December 1958 for a run of 1,039 performances, transferring from Broadway via the Manchester Opera House. The London premiere of Fiddler on the Roof was on 16 February 1967, starring Chaim Topol, and the production ran at Her Majesty's for 2,030 performances. Forty years after the original stage adaptation, André Previn's musical adaptation of The Good Companions premiered on 11 July 1974, followed by <b>Andrew</b> <b>Lloyd</b> <b>Webber</b> and Alan Ayckbourn's initially unsuccessful collaboration, Jeeves, on 22 April 1975, which has since enjoyed considerable success.|$|E
5|$|Within the City of Westminster in London, the {{entertainment}} district of the West End has its focus around Leicester Square, where London and world film premieres are held, and Piccadilly Circus, with its giant electronic advertisements. London's theatre district is here, as are many cinemas, bars, clubs, and restaurants, including the city's Chinatown district (in Soho), {{and just to}} the east is Covent Garden, an area housing speciality shops. The city {{is the home of}} <b>Andrew</b> <b>Lloyd</b> <b>Webber,</b> whose musicals have dominated the West End theatre since the late 20th century. The United Kingdom's Royal Ballet, English National Ballet, Royal Opera, and English National Opera are based in London and perform at the Royal Opera House, the London Coliseum, Sadler's Wells Theatre, and the Royal Albert Hall, as well as touring the country.|$|E

5|$|Early English composers in {{classical}} music include Renaissance artists Thomas Tallis and William Byrd, followed up by Henry Purcell from the Baroque period. German-born George Frideric Handel became a British subject and {{spent most of}} his composing life in London, creating some of the most well-known works of classical music, The Messiah, Water Music, and Music for the Royal Fireworks. One of his four Coronation Anthems, Zadok the Priest, composed for the coronation of George II, has been performed at every subsequent British coronation, traditionally during the sovereign's anointing. There was a revival in the profile of composers from England in the 20th century led by Edward Elgar, Benjamin Britten, Frederick Delius, Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams and others. Present-day composers from England include Michael Nyman, best known for The Piano, and <b>Andrew</b> <b>Lloyd</b> <b>Webber,</b> whose musicals have achieved enormous success in the West End and worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The theatre {{became part}} of the West End theatre scene and still stages popular musical {{productions}}.
