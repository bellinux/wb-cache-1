5|$|Dumouriez {{would bear}} a harsh change of fortune: after one more {{influential}} success in November 1792 at Jemappes, {{he was by}} the following year a broken man. His army had suffered such catastrophic losses that he defected to the royalist side {{for the rest of}} his life. Kellermann, however, continued in <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> distinguished military career. In 1808 he was ennobled by Napoleon and became Duke of Valmy.|$|E

5|$|In 1202 Pope Innocent, {{persuaded that}} Harald was not {{personally}} responsible for the abuse of Bishop John, wrote to Bishop Bjarni to order him to ensure that Harald's man Lumberd, who was blamed for the deeds, was suitably punished.

The Y chromosome is metacentric and the X chromosome is variable, ranging from nearly metacentric to acrocentric in five specimens studied.|$|E

5|$|This kind {{of combat}} was {{consistent}} with the aim of minimising casualties and its efficacy is illustrated by the Battle of Strasbourg.

5|$|Women's {{literature}} in Britain has had <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> often troubled history, with many female writers producing work under a pen name, such as George Eliot.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> winding route had to {{be taken}} to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was at the extreme ends of the decks, and so was the {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps no coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E
5|$|ATV Music {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} the Lennon–McCartney song catalogue, Northern Songs, in 1969. The catalog featured almost every song written by Lennon–McCartney. Northern Songs was co-owned by Lennon, McCartney, Brian Epstein and Dick James, who owned a controlling interest. In 1969, James offered to sell his shares to ATV. Lennon and McCartney then attempted to gain a controlling interest in the company. Their bid to gain control, part of <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> acrimonious fight, failed. The financial clout of Grade, their adversary in the bidding war, ensured that the songs written by the two Beatles passed into the control of ATV.|$|E
