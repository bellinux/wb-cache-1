40|$|The {{concept of}} ‘ medical grade honey ’ started in August 2000 {{following}} global demand for high quality medical grade honey and honey-based health products. Our company, Comvita, specifically its medical division, has ongoing activities in honey research and intellectual property development {{together with the}} University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand. The company currently holds a range of honey product patents and also participates and funds numerous research and clinical trials for further product development and extension. The research interest of the company extends from wound care to oral/dental hygiene, throat care, internal health, skin care, eye care and immune support. A unique accredited honey supply programme has been developed as company intellectual property to meet the quality requirements of Medical Device manufacturing internationally. The programme includes an <b>accredited</b> <b>supplier</b> network {{with the development of}} quality standards and systems for honey resourcing, harvesting and extraction. Quality management standards and systems have also been developed for honey processing. Strict product testing regimes were also set for ensuring the integrity of ‘ medical grade honey ’ supply. Whilst some of the more exact components of the medical grade honey processing and measuring techniques, as well as the supply programme, are held confidentially within intellectual property management, this chapter gives an overview of the exacting efforts put in to ensure that the honey used in the medical arena is of true ‘medical grade’. The systems developed for the programme were done in consideration of preventing any possible microbiological, physical and chemical contamination that cannot be removed afterwards, and also for th...|$|E

50|$|The best {{strategy}} {{for control of}} avocado scab is to use plant material from <b>accredited</b> <b>suppliers</b> who provide certified disease-free seeds and other propagative material. During the growing season {{it is important to}} routinely check crops for symptoms of disease and any unusual pest activity. Thrips are a proven vector of S. perseae spread and target the vulnerable young avocado fruit. Female thrips deposit eggs into the young fruit. The eggs hatch and larvae begin to feed on and damage the skin. The early development of the fruit is a critical time for fungal infection and this overlap with thrip damage exacerbates the infection of the disease. It is important to eliminate or minimize thrips for effective control of scabs. Proven methods for control of thrips consist of cultural practices and biological measures are also continuously being studied. Using a coarse composted mulch around the tree prevents thrips from pupating in the ground beneath the tree itself. Practices involving predatory insects that feed on thrips are being studied for efficiency and cost control.|$|R

It is increasingly recognised that mental health service users with limited English proficiency are rendered doubly vulnerable by the combination of their illness and their language difficulties. Only recently has the importance of safe, coherent, nationally available interpreting, translation and language support (ITALS) been recognised by healthcare providers. We review the challenges within the interpreted interaction, some reasons for the scarcity of qualified and <b>accredited</b> ITALS <b>suppliers,</b> and some solutions to the ITALS problem...|$|R
40|$|Aims. To {{determine}} the effects of sodium metabisulphite and blanching pretreatments on the quality characteristics of yam bean (Pachyrhizus erosus) flour. Study Design: Evaluation of the effects of peeling, blanching and sodium metabisulphite pretreatments on the ease of drying, particle size distribution, colour and pH of yam bean flour using a 2 x 3 factorial design. Place and Duration of Study: Yam bean roots were obtained from the CSIR-Crops Research Institute, Kumasi, Ghana. All reagents used were obtained from <b>accredited</b> <b>suppliers</b> in Accra, Ghana. Actual experimental studies were conducted at the laboratories of the CSIR-Food Research Institute, Accra, Ghana, between August 2012 and November 2013. Methodology. We subjected peeled and unpeeled yam bean tubers (Pachyrhizus erosus) to three pretreatments involving blanching at 100 C for 3 min; soaking in 0. 1 % sodium metabisulphite solution for 3 min and no treatment control. Samples were dried at 55 C for 6 hours, cooled to room temperature, milled, sieved and the flour analyzed for ease of drying as indicated by the final moisture content, colour, pH, and ease of milling as indicated by particle size distribution. Results: The pretreatment methods had significant (p> 0. 05) effects on the colour of the flour samples. Peeling, followed by sodium metabisulphite pretreatment produced whitest yam bean flour (L-value of 90. 89). Flour samples from unpeeled roots recorded lower pH (p> 0. 05) than those from peeled samples. The combined effects of peeling and sodium metabisulphite or blanching pretreatments produced flours with desirable pH values. The blanched sample had coarser particles (50 %> 100 m) compared to the no treatment control and sodium metabisulphite treated flours (30 %> 100 m). Peeling, metabisulphite or blanching pretreatments did not affect the rate of drying significantly as indicated by their final moisture values. Conclusion: A standard procedure for yam bean flour production has been suggested to include peeling and sodium metabisulphite pretreatmentPeer Revie...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{low quality}} forest {{reproductive}} material {{is one of}} the major reasons for the mixed results of past watershed rehabilitation programs in the Philippines. Since 2010, a national policy on forest nursery accreditation has been implemented to regulate the quality of forest reproductive materials. Implementers of forest rehabilitation programs are directed to use high quality seedlings from <b>accredited</b> seedling <b>suppliers.</b> Despite this requirement, low quality seedlings are still largely planted in reforestation projects including the recent National Greening Program (NGP). Surveys of the forest nursery sector in Eastern Visayas and Northern Mindanao regions were carried out to determine the effectiveness and challenges in implementing the forest nursery accreditation policy. The survey has identified factors that limit the effectiveness of seedling quality regulation including insufficient seedling production schedules due to delayed disbursement of project funds, inappropriate criteria for seedling quality assessment, lack of auditing of seedling quality in accredited nurseries, and insufficient monitoring of seedling supply chain among the network of nurseries supplying seedlings for reforestation programs. The limited sources of high quality germplasm, nursery operators' limited information on the attributes of high quality planting materials and insufficient knowledge on high quality seedling production technologies contributed to the widespread production of low quality seedlings. Nursery accreditation represents a huge leap in promoting the success of watershed rehabilitation nationally. However, considerable improvement of the implementation system and establishment of support mechanisms is necessary...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{low quality}} {{planting}} material {{is one of}} the major reasons for the limited success of past reforestation programs in the Philippines and elsewhere in the tropics. In the Philippines, a national policy has been in place since 2010, which regulates the quality of seedlings. As part of the policy, government reforestation programs are required to use only high quality seedlings from <b>accredited</b> seedling <b>suppliers.</b> A survey of nurseries producing seedlings for the National Greening Program in Eastern Visayas and Northern Mindanao regions was carried out to determine the effectiveness and challenges in implementing the forest nursery accreditation policy. The survey identified factors that limit the effectiveness of seedling quality regulation including lack of auditing of seedling quality in accredited nurseries, insufficient monitoring of the seedling supply chain among the network of nurseries supplying seedlings for reforestation programs, inadequate seedling production schedules, and inappropriate criteria for seedling quality assessment. The limited sources of high quality germplasm, nursery operators’ limited information on the attributes of high quality planting materials and lack of knowledge about high quality seedling production technologies contributed to the widespread production of low quality seedlings. The lack of seedling quality checks makes the government’s bidding scheme of seedling purchases prone to favouring the proliferation of low quality seedlings that are usually sold at lower prices. Nursery accreditation represents a major initiative in promoting the success of Philippine reforestation but our study found that considerable improvement of the policy and of its implementation is necessary. From our study, key lessons can be learned for the implementation of forest landscape restoration initiatives in other tropical developing countries. © 2016 Steve Harrison, John Herboh...|$|R
40|$|Several {{standards}} {{address the}} calibration of test equipment, but one has achieved almost universal adoption {{as the basis}} for accreditation: ISO/IEC 17025. The general quality standard, ISO 9000 : 1994, has a section titled 4. 11 Inspection, Measuring, and Test Equipment that lays out the basic requirements for calibration. Section 4. 11 also points out the need for adequate measurement uncertainties in the related procedures. Typically an assessor to ISO 9000 doesn't have the technical background to make a judgement on the adequacy of calibration procedures. ISO 9000 : 2000 7. 6 Control of Measuring and Monitoring Devices references ISO 10012 for guidance, but this standard is not normally utilized by laboratory accreditation agencies. The use of an accredited laboratory is meant to reduce multiple audits to a supplier. Accreditation, unlike registration of a quality system, adds the dimension of technical proficiency to the assessment. An accredited laboratory has been evaluated not only on the robustness of their quality system, but also their technical proficiency to determine if they can actually make the measurements to the degree of accuracy claimed. If a laboratory is accredited in this manner, it eliminates the need for second party audits since the purchaser can rely on the results from the third party accreditation assessor. It is for this reason- technical proficiency and assurance- that some industries and customers rely on accreditation as the hallmark of a capable laboratory. QS 9000 developed by the big three automotive companies- Ford, General Motors and Daimler Chrysler- is moving to require <b>accredited</b> calibrations for <b>suppliers.</b> One of the difficulties they are encountering, however, is the scarcity of accredited labs for calibration. Until there are sufficient laboratories available, the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) recommends some alternatives such as second party audits. See the AIAG web site a...|$|R
