40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} socially optimal forest taxation {{when the}} government has a binding tax revenue requirement. In the Faustmann model the optimal design of forest taxation consists of non-distortionary taxes, such as site productivity tax, site value tax or profit tax. A combination of distortionary unit (or yield) tax and timber tax {{can also be used to}} collect the tax revenue in a non-distortionary way. In the Hartman model with amenity services as a public good, the optimal design consists of a non-distortionary tax and a Pigouvian tax, which adjusts the private rotation age to the socially optimal one. Now only the site productivity tax is non-distortionary, while unit, yield, timber, site value and profit taxes generally serve as a corrective Pigouvian taxes. In the absence of a nondistortionary tax, a combination of unit (or yield) and timber taxes can often be used to both tax revenue collection and Pigouvian correction.

40|$|Abstract The state-level {{distribution}} {{of the size of}} family forest holdings in the contiguous United States was examined using data collected by the USDA Forest Service in 1993 and 2003. Regressions models were used to analyze the factors influencing the mean size and structural variation among states and between the two periods. Population density, percent of the population at least 65 years of age, percent of the population residing in urban areas, per capita income, income inequality, and per capita private forestland were found to be significantly correlated with the structure of landholding size. This paper suggests that the number and proportion of small-scale family forest owners in the United States are both increasing due to the increasing importance of non-timber <b>amenities</b> to <b>forest</b> landowners...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{interest}} in uneven-aged forestry {{has been increasing}} in Britain, particularly for sensitive areas such as recreation and <b>amenity</b> <b>forests.</b> Literature on the economics of uneven-aged forestry is scarce and few operational, uneven-aged forests are available for study. Therefore, in order to quantify the operating costs associated with uneven-aged forestry, a modelling approach was chosen. The resulting model is written in FORTRAN and uses a series of square two-dimensional arrays to represent a block of forest. The block may then be managed by clearfelling and replanting at a specified age, or by a system of group management {{with a choice of}} four group sizes. The resulting model was then used to investigate the effect of the following management strategies on operating times: 1. Varying the scale of working (i. e. the group size and forest size) in the uneven-aged forest. 2. Using shortwood or pole-length harvesting systems and a range of machine types within each harvesting system. 3. Varying the length of time taken to transform the structure of the forest from even-aged to uneven-aged. 4. Varying the age of the trees when the transformation from even-aged to uneven-aged structure begins. The results obtained from running the model show that the time taken to carry out an operation is influenced both by the absolute size of the group within the forest block and by the number of groups of that size within the forest block. This fragmentation effect explains why {{it is difficult to determine}} the absolute costs of working for a specific group size, because it is the combination of group size, number of groups and forest block size, which determines costs. Most of the results below are based on a range of group sizes from 1. 000 ha. to 0. 0625 ha., with a block size of 16 ha. Forwarders were penalized when the group size was decreased to 0. 0625 ha.

40|$|We use the Hartman {{rotation}} {{model to}} study behavioral {{and social welfare}} effects of forest tax progression. The following new results are shown for harvest and timber taxes. First, a tax-revenue neutral increase in the timber tax rate, compensated by a higher tax exemption, will shorten the optimal private rotation age. A sufficient condition for this to hold for the yield and unit taxes is that the marginal valuation of amenities is non-decreasing with the age of forest stand. Second, for the socially optimal forest taxation, if society can use the neutral site productivity tax to collect tax revenue, the proportional forest tax is enough to internalize the externality caused by private harvesting. Finally, even though site productivity tax is not available, the tax structure should be designed so that tax exemption is neutral implying that the optimal corrective forest taxes remain unchanged. 2 ̆ 013 rotation; <b>amenity</b> services; <b>forest</b> taxation; tax progressio...|$|R
40|$|Federal {{downsizing}} {{and reduced}} appropriations within the USDA Forest Service (USFS) {{have resulted in}} increased use of partnerships to deliver visitor services. Partnerships are the relationships in which two or more parties combine resources (e. g., funds, labor, information, skills) to accomplish a shared objective. Examples of USFS recreation partners include individual volunteers, professional contractors, and concessionaires. Partnerships provide a variety of services that may be otherwise neglected with fiscal constraints; for example, campground hosts, trail maintenance crews, and specialized recreation outfitters and guides provide visitor services the public desires. Although previous studies and USFS Accomplishment Reports indicate that partners {{are being used to}} deliver recreation services, {{there is a lack of}} understanding concerning the structure and function of these relationships. This thesis presents data from the second phase of a multi-phase study exploring the role of recreation partnerships on national forests. Using grounded theory, Phase I gathered and analyzed semi-structured interview data with key informants (n = 21). From these interviews, a conceptual framework of USFS recreation partnerships evolved, and internal commitment to partnerships and the external environment of forests emerged as indicators of agency capacity to partner. Internal commitment was defined by the presence, or lack of, a partnership coordinator on the forest. External environment was characterized by geographical location with urban forests, rural <b>forests</b> and <b>amenity</b> <b>forests</b> typifying various levels of partnership access for forest personnel. Phase II investigated these themes of commitment and environment using a multiple-case study methodology. Interviews with USFS personnel (n = 45) on six national forests representing a variety of internal commitment and external environment scenarios enabled the refinement of the partnership conceptual framework and indicators of agency capacity to administer partnerships. Specifically, this study illustrated that personnel motivations also influence agency capacity to partner. Fifteen distinct motivations emerged from informant interviews, which were classified within three categories of motivations: interpersonal, intrapersonal, and institutional. Together these themes of agency capacity [...] commitment, environment, and motivation [...] describe six unique cases of partnership involvement. These findings enable an increased awareness of agency capacity to partner and may enhance the leadership support, agency-partner interactions, and personnel motivations necessary to sustain USFS partnerships...|$|R

40|$|Urban {{forests in}} urban environments are under {{pressure}} in Finland. The urban expansion causes a loss of urban forests. Urban forests have been increasingly studied, and their properties of improving e. g. air quality, noise reduction and recreational benefits have {{become more and more}} valued. In the case of Finland, the urban forests are often existing forests, which have become enveloped by growing amount of urban development. The necessity of having urban forests in an urban environment has recently been justified with the growing adaptation of the ecosystem services. Ecosystem services can be described as benefits gained for human beings from ecosystems in general, combined with a more economical assessment. In regards to urban forests the ecosystem services include matters such as climate management, storm water management and recreation. Urban forests have also been studied as a way to complement traditional forestry. This new approach to forestry is called urban forestry, and it has been coined as a way to go about the growing urbanization and the ever more urban <b>forest</b> <b>amenities.</b> In urban forestry urban forests can serve other functions, not only production. These alternative functions can be of those of recreation etc. This thesis studies three cases in northern Finland, in the city of Oulu. These cases are residential development areas that are different in size, but they share similarities such as housing type and location in the peripheries. It is the aim of this study to observe how urban <b>forest</b> <b>amenities</b> are treated in a planning stage. The availability of <b>forest</b> <b>amenities</b> in northern Finland is predictably high, but the treatment of urban forests is a feature that has not got much attention.

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a demand to {{increase}} the wood mobilisation from French private forests which are {{a significant part of the}} national wood supply. Nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) owners are frequently not only timber producers, but also providers of <b>forest</b> <b>amenities,</b> from which they derive a private utility as well as positive externalities for the rest of the society. This is often addressed as a limit to wood exploitation, since generally there is a trade-off between timber production and <b>amenities.</b> However, the <b>forest</b> property fragmentation and the passive management of some private forest owners are also considered as restraining the wood supply. We propose an econometric analysis of the harvesting decision with particular attention to the role of NIPF landowners’ management objectives. We defined four categories of management objectives: “production-oriented”, “production & amenities”, “amenities-oriented”, and “no objectives”, using a sample of 432 French NIPF landowners. The aim was to identify the relevant factors influencing the harvest decision, and, in particular, the role of amenities-oriented objectives and no-objectives. Results showed that a change in the management objective from production-oriented to amenities-oriented significantly reduced the probability of harvesting. The lack of management objectives as well as absenteeism, however, exhibited an even higher negative effect. Consistently with a utility maximisation framework, both economic variables (timber price and income) and landowners’ socio-demographic characteristics were significant predictors of the harvesting decision. From a policy viewpoint, our results suggest to address incentives schemes on passive forest owners in order to increase wood production...|$|R

This study therefore starts with a quantitative economic assessment of the direct and indirect damage caused by landslides in a 2, 910 km² study area located west of Brussels, a low-relief region susceptible to landslides. Based on focus interviews {{as well as on}} semi-structured interviews with homeowners, civil servants and the owners and providers of lifelines such as electricity and sewage, a quantitative damage assessment is provided. For private properties (houses, forest and pasture land) we estimate the real estate and production value losses for different damage scenarios, while for public infrastructure the costs of measures to repair and prevent landslide induced damage are estimated. In addition, the increase in <b>amenity</b> value of <b>forests</b> and grasslands due to the occurrence of landslides is also calculated. The study illustrates that a minority of land (only 2. 3 %) within the study area is used for dwellings, roads and railway lines, but that these land use types are responsible {{for the vast majority of}} the economic damage due to the occurrence of landslides. The annual cost of direct damage due to landsliding amounts to 688, 148 €/year out of which 550, 740 €/year for direct damage to houses, while the annual indirect damage augments to 3, 020, 049 €/year out of which 2, 007, 375 €/year for indirect damage to real estate.

40|$|Forests {{can play}} a major role in climate {{regulation}} by reducing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Forests also provide a range of other ecological goods and services such as biodiversity and watershed protection and amenity benefits. On the other hand, deforestation and suburban sprawl have substantially changed and fragmented our landscape. While the economic importance of open space and <b>forest</b> <b>amenities</b> and the implications of nontimber benefits for harvesting within the traditional Faustmann framework are well understood, the feedback effects between urban development and forest land changes are not. However, the development of a framework to fully exploit the interplay between urban development and deforestation may reinforce the workings of emission reduction programs if co-benefits from land-based mitigation are realized. The purpose of this paper is to offer a first step towards such framework. In particular, this paper has developed a model of a single forest owner operating with perfect foresight in a dynamic open-city environment that allows for switching between alternative competing land uses (forest and urban use) at some point in the future. The model also incorporates external values of an even-aged standing forest in addition to the value of timber when it is harvested. Timber is exploited based on a multiple rotation model a la Faustmann with clear-cut harvesting. In contrast to previous models, our alternative land use to forest land is endogenous. Within this framework, we study the problem of the private owner as well as that of the social planner, when choosing the time to harvest, the time to convert land and the intensity of development. We also examine the extent to which the two-way linkage between urban development and forest management practices (timber production and provision of <b>forest</b> <b>amenities)</b> contributes to economic efficiency and improvements in non-market forest benefits. Finally, we consider policy options available to a regulator seeking to achieve improvements in efficiency including anti-sprawl policies (impact fees and density controls) and forest policies such a yield tax.

A combination of distortionary unit (or yield) tax and timber tax {{can also be used to}} collect the tax revenue in a nondistortionary way. In the Hartman model with <b>forest</b> <b>amenity</b> services as a public good, the optimal design consists of a non-distortionary tax and a Pigouvian tax, which adjusts the private rotation age to the socially optimal one. Now only the site productivity tax is non-distortionary, while unit, yield, timber, site value and profit taxes generally serve as corrective Pigouvian taxes. Finally, in the absence of a non-distortionary tax, if the marginal valuation of amenity services is non-decreasing with the age of forest stand, a combination of unit (or yield) and timber taxes can be used to both tax revenue collection and Pigouvian correction...|$|R
