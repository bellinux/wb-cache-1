5|$|Expedition to the Barrier Peaks {{takes place}} on a {{spaceship}} in the Barrier Peaks mountain range of the World of Greyhawk campaign setting.

The Grand Duke of Geoff has hired the characters to discover {{the origin of the}} creatures, <b>and</b> <b>stop</b> their incursions.|$|E
40|$|AbstractVoluntary action control {{requires}} {{selection of}} appropriate responses <b>and</b> <b>stopping</b> of inappropriate responses. Selection <b>and</b> <b>stopping</b> are often investigated separately, but {{they appear to}} recruit similar brain regions, including the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) and inferior frontal gyrus. We therefore examined the evidence for overlap of selection <b>and</b> <b>stopping</b> using two approaches: a meta-analysis of existing studies of selection <b>and</b> <b>stopping,</b> <b>and</b> a novel within-subject fMRI study in which action selection <b>and</b> a <b>stop</b> signal task were combined factorially. The novel fMRI study also permitted us to investigate hypotheses regarding a common mechanism for selection <b>and</b> <b>stopping.</b> The preSMA was identified by both methods as common to selection <b>and</b> <b>stopping.</b> However, stopping a selected action did not recruit preSMA more than stopping a specified action, nor did stop signal reaction times differ significantly across the two conditions. These {{findings suggest that the}} preSMA supports both action selection <b>and</b> <b>stopping,</b> but the two processes may not require access to a common inhibition mechanism. Instead, the preSMA might represent information about potential actions that is used in both action selection <b>and</b> <b>stopping</b> in order to resolve conflict between competing available responses...|$|R

5|$|After Harrison {{returned}} to the United States from Colombia, he settled on his farm in North Bend, Ohio, his adopted home state, living in relative retirement after nearly four decades of government service. Having accumulated no substantial wealth during his lifetime, he subsisted on his savings, a small pension, and the income produced by his farm. Harrison cultivated corn and established a distillery to produce whiskey. After a brief time in the liquor business, he became disturbed by the effects of alcohol on its consumers, and closed the distillery. In a later address to the Hamilton County Agricultural Board in 1831, Harrison said he had sinned in making whiskey, and hoped that others would learn from his mistake <b>and</b> <b>stop</b> the production of liquors.|$|E
