5|$|Upon {{winning the}} 2009 French Open and {{completing}} the career Grand Slam, Federer {{became the first}} individual male tennis player to grace the cover of Sports Illustrated since <b>Andre</b> <b>Agassi</b> in 1999. He {{was also the first}} non-American player to appear {{on the cover of the}} magazine since Stefan Edberg in 1992. Federer again made the cover of Sports Illustrated following his record breaking 8th Wimbledon title and second Grand Slam of 2017, becoming the first male tennis player to be featured on the cover since himself in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Nadal {{defeated}} Djokovic in {{four sets}} {{in three hours}} and forty-three minutes, to win his first US Open title, and thus complete the Career Golden Slam (equalling the feat achieved by <b>Andre</b> <b>Agassi).</b> He also became the first Spaniard since Manuel Orantes in 1975 to win at Flushing Meadows, became the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win Major titles at the French Open, Wimbledon and US Open simultaneously and became only the second man after Laver to hold two Major titles on each surface (hard, clay and grass). The second set which Djokovic won was the only set Nadal lost in the entire championships. This would prove to become the main rivalry in tennis over the next 18 months.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} {{partners}} leads the Simpson family to begin arguing and aggressively competing against one another. The tournament takes place, {{and in the}} stands, are leading tennis professionals <b>Andre</b> <b>Agassi,</b> Pete Sampras, Venus Williams, and Serena Williams. At the tournament, Homer ditches Lisa for Venus Williams. In response, Marge replaces Bart with Serena Williams as her partner. Ultimately, Serena and Venus replace Marge and Homer with Sampras and Agassi, respectively. This forces the family {{to go back to}} the bench and resume their normal places in the family. As they enjoy the exhibition of top-class tennis, they agree that it is better to watch things than to do things, and Homer offers to buy the family dinner with money he took from Sampras' wallet.|$|E
5|$|The four Grand Slam tournaments, the ATP World Tour Finals, nine ATP Masters 1000s and the Summer Olympics, {{make up the}} 15 {{most coveted}} {{top-level}} tournaments in men's tennis. Although no player has won each of these 15 events in men's singles, this feat has been achieved in men's doubles by Canada's Daniel Nestor and the United States' Bryan Brothers, Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan. Djokovic matches the result in men's singles of <b>Andre</b> <b>Agassi,</b> who ended his career having won 13 of these 15 events, achieving a Career Grand Slam (winning all four majors in a career), a Career Golden Slam (winning all four majors and the Olympic singles gold medal in a career), and what Sports Illustrated called a Career Super Slam (winning all four majors, the Olympic singles gold medal, and the ATP World Tour Finals).|$|E
5|$|At the ATP finals, Murray beat Djokovic 6–3 6–4, {{claiming}} {{the title and}} the No.1 spot {{at the end of}} the year, and ending 2016 on a 24-match winning streak, the longest of his career. He became the second player after <b>Andre</b> <b>Agassi</b> to win Grand Slam, World Tour Finals, Olympic and Masters titles, and the first to do so in the same calendar year. 2016 marked the first year since 2003 that neither Federer, Nadal or Djokovic finished the year as world number 1. Despite his struggles with form throughout the second half of the year, Djokovic still ended 2016 as world number 2. Having suffered from injury plagued seasons, Nadal and Federer ended the year at number 9 and number 16 respectively. For Nadal it was his lowest end of year ranking since 2004, while Federer's fall in the rankings meant that November 2016 marked his first time outside the top 10 since October 2002.|$|E
5|$|Starting the US hard-court {{season with}} the 2010 Farmers Classic, Murray reached the final but lost against Sam Querrey in three sets. This was his first loss to Querrey in five career meetings. In Canada, Murray became the first player since <b>Andre</b> <b>Agassi</b> in 1995 to defend the Canadian Masters. Murray {{defeated}} Nadal and then Federer in straight sets, ending his eight-month title drought. At the Cincinnati Masters, Murray first complained about {{the speed of the}} court, and then in a quarterfinal match with Fish, Murray complained that the organisers refused to put the match on later in the day With temperatures reaching 33°C in the shade, Murray won the first set in a tie-breaker but began to feel ill. The doctor was called on court to actively cool Murray down. Murray said after the match that he had considered retiring. He lost the second set, but forced a final-set tie-breaker, before Fish won. After losing to Stanislas Wawrinka in the third round of the US Open, questions about Murray's conditioning arose, as he called the trainer out twice during the match.|$|E
5|$|At the 2009 Wimbledon Championships, {{his poor}} grass-court form {{from the past}} continued, as {{he went down to}} unseeded Lleyton Hewitt in the second round. In the Davis Cup quarter-final against the Czech Republic, del Potro won his matches against Ivo Minář and Berdych in {{straight}} sets, but Argentina still lost the tie 2–3, eliminating them from the competition. A few weeks later, he defeated Hewitt and Fernando González en route to the Washington final. He successfully defended his title against top-seeded Wimbledon finalist Andy Roddick to win his second tournament of the year and become the first player since <b>Andre</b> <b>Agassi</b> to win back-to-back Washington titles. Del Potro played the following week at the Masters 1000 in Montreal, where he was seeded sixth, defeating world No. 2 Nadal in the quarterfinals, his second win in a row over Nadal. He then defeated Roddick in the semifinals, saving a match point, to advance to his first Masters 1000 final, and to improve his head-to-head record against Roddick to 3–0. In the final, he lost against Murray in three sets. He later withdrew from the next Masters 1000 event in Cincinnati due to fatigue.|$|E
5|$|Federer and <b>Andre</b> <b>Agassi</b> played {{each other}} 11 times between 1998 and 2005 before Agassi's {{retirement}} in 2006. Federer led the rivalry 8–3. This was Federer's most significant rivalry with an all-time great {{player of the}} previous generation. They first met in only the third tournament of Federer's career at the 1998 Swiss Indoors in Federer's hometown, with Agassi prevailing over the 17-year-old. Agassi also defeated Federer at the 2001 US Open and the finals of the Miami Masters in 2002. Federer began to turn the tide at the Masters Cup in 2003, when he defeated Agassi in both the round robin and the final. They played a memorable quarterfinal match at the 2004 US Open that spanned over two days with Federer eventually prevailing in five sets. At the 2005 Dubai Championships, Federer and Agassi attracted worldwide headlines with a publicity stunt that saw the two tennis legends play on a helipad almost 220 meters above sea level at the hotel Burj al-Arab. Their final match was {{at one of the}} most prestigious platforms in the sport, when they played in the finals of the 2005 US Open. Federer was victorious in four sets, claiming the 6th Grand Slam tournament of his career and denying Agassi his 9th.|$|E
5|$|Nadal {{defeated}} Federer in 5 sets in 4 {{hours and}} 19 minutes, with the match finishing after midnight, {{to become the}} first Spaniard to win the Australian Open. The match was lauded {{as one of the greatest}} ever at the Australian Open and it was yet another high quality match between two of the greatest players of all time, only 6 months since their epic 2008 Wimbledon final. It was a match of huge significance as had Federer won the match he would have equalled the all-time Grand Slam tournament record of 14 by Pete Sampras and the open-era record for most Australian Open titles of 4 with <b>Andre</b> <b>Agassi</b> (he would go on to achieve these in the near future). However, as a result of Nadal winning he set his own records, holding 3 of the 4 slams at the same time for the first time in his career. Not only that but he became the first man in the open-era to hold 3 Grand Slam tournament titles on 3 different surfaces at the same time. This victory over Federer many believed brought about a change in the tennis standings as Nadal was now clearly the number 1 player after Federer had that title for over 4 and a half years consecutively with Nadal deemed the second best for nearly 3 years of that. The defeat brought Federer to tears as he came to terms with his loss.|$|E
25|$|Safin {{started his}} {{professional}} career in 1997. In 1998, Safin consecutively defeated <b>Andre</b> <b>Agassi</b> and defending champion Gustavo Kuerten at the French Open.
