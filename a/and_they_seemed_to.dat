5|$|There {{were other}} folk-music records, {{commercial}} folk-music records, like those by the Kingston Trio. I never really was an elitist. Personally, I liked the Kingston Trio. I {{could see the}} picture...the Kingston Trio were probably the best commercial group going, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{know what they were}} doing.|$|E
2500|$|Jonah Raskin, {{whose wife}} Eleanor Raskin {{was part of}} the Weather Underground organization, and who was himself a courier for the Underground, recalls the last time he spoke with the members of the {{collective}} in New York: [...] "I had talked to them not long before the townhouse blew up <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have lost touch with reality- and were incapable of making sensible decisions about almost everything." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....I {{had a lot}} of {{time for}} Norling as an {{international}} referee. The Welshman and New Zealander David Bishop would be the best I've seen during my years of Test match rugby. And the common factor linking Norling and Bishop was that both played the advantage rule very well, they had a real empathy for the game and its players, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> enjoy letting the game flow. Rarely could either official be accused of whistling for a stoppage prematurely... Norling was also one of the more flamboyant referees. The crowd always knew when he was out there. At the same time, he was a top drawer referee and perhaps could get away with a bit of the showmanship because his decisions were generally spot-on.|$|E
25|$|They {{have not}} been charged, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be prisoners of conscience.|$|R
50|$|Marsham {{married a}} woman named Elizabeth, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have had no children.|$|R
50|$|Their favored {{breeding}} beaches are mainland sites facing deep water, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> avoid {{those sites}} protected by coral reefs.|$|R
60|$|Dave {{listened to}} the words, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> burn into his very heart. He came forward with a face as white as death itself.|$|E
60|$|He was a German, {{with a large}} pasty {{face and}} a yellow moustache. His eyes were small, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{contract}} with greed as they looked upon the coin.|$|E
60|$|Now Istra Nash knew {{perfectly}} {{that the}} customs persons were {{not ready to}} examine her baggage as yet. But the discussion was ended, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> understand each other.|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't do {{that any}} more," [...] said Victoria. [...] "It's {{only a little}} drive and a walk, now <b>and</b> then. <b>And</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be growing--scarcer." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Persian {{name has}} no {{link with the}} Turkish variant, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have arisen independently of each other, rather than being a borrowing into the Turkish language.|$|R
6000|$|... "O yes. I {{heard the}} cap'n {{say it would}} be quite easy, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be makin' ready now, so if any of 'ee want breakfast you'd better turn out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know. I didn't know I {{was doing}} any harm; I didn't MEAN {{to do any}} harm. They were very nice people, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> like me." ...|$|E
60|$|The party moved {{ahead in}} a cloud of laughter. The ladies were dainty as spring flowers in their light, outdoor dresses, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> light up the whole barnyard.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were alone}} {{when you were}} dealing with these men?" [...] said Cleever, {{watching}} The Infant's face under {{the palm of his}} hand. He was receiving new ideas, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> trouble him.|$|E
30|$|Conclusion The {{patients}} with pathological ultrasonography {{within the framework}} of cholestasis diagnosis <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be icteric {{patients with}} more pathological comorbidities, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have less drug etiology on univariate analysis.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{twist of}} the birds," [...] Dominey explained, [...] "is simply a local superstition. The wood ends on the slant, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be flying {{more to the}} left than they really are." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bones Swiss {{bearings}} ("I {{think these}} are Labyrinths, though, I think ... but, I don't know, Swiss, usually; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> work okay. I don't really change them a lot—I try not to change anything very much.") ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} in his voice which made the hearts of his hearers ache. Ida glanced up at Bradley now and then, at the most dramatic points, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> grow nearer together in their sympathy.|$|E
60|$|They {{were the}} first words he had spoken since his arrival, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> hold all his pentup indignation. The girls pitied the old man and, {{recognizing}} in him a fellow prisoner, sought to comfort him.|$|E
6000|$|Silence fell on him. He saw his mother, his sisters, others--good people, {{he would}} swear! And yet--! He heard their voices, frank and clear; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be talking of the Germans. If only she were not German! ...|$|E
30|$|The {{disturbances}} of ADHD disorder <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{be associated}} with an alteration of the dopaminergic system, that is, it is involved with mechanisms of attention <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> involve a frontal-lobe dysfunction and basal ganglia areas [3, 13].|$|R
50|$|The {{echolocation}} {{calls of}} slit-faced bats are relatively quiet and short in duration, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> target their prey by hearing the sounds it produces, {{rather than by}} sonar. They give birth once or twice each year.|$|R
6000|$|... "We must be {{near the}} reef, by that. I think the only {{currents}} we feel come from the tide, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be setting us back and forth, instead of carrying us in any one settled direction." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Notting Hill! Notting Hill!" [...] cried frightful voices {{out of the}} darkness, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{come from}} all sides, for the men of North Kensington, unacquainted with the road, had lost all their {{bearings}} in the black world of blindness.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{they pointed}} out," [...] said the lawyer, [...] "that the great American {{fortunes}} {{had been made}} by men who had never had their educational advantages, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> think that what we call the education of a gentleman was a little too good for money-making purposes." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} be getting darker and darker. I could hear the sound of Peter's footsteps, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> drag as he forced his way through the bushes. And then, quite suddenly, he sat down without any warning, and when I ran up I heard him crying.|$|E
5000|$|The second sister, Rote is red-haired {{and often}} seen {{laughing}}. Her laughing usually annoys Madoka, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> consider {{each other as}} rivals. She pilots the Red Snapper Spirits. Her name is the German word for [...] "red".|$|R
6000|$|... “I’ve been {{watching}} that log since lunch, and she’s doing very badly,” he said, indicating the dial of a brass instrument on the taffrail. “There’s hardly sea enough {{to account for}} it, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be firing up.” ...|$|R
50|$|Brave and energetic, Yume is {{the hunter}} of the group. She {{also has a}} {{tendency}} to try and protect Shihoru because of her shy and timid nature. She has a good friendship with Haruhiro <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> get along well.|$|R
6000|$|... "You promised {{my mother}} to go abroad. What else have you promised?" [...] He {{continued}} silent, and she added, [...] "You are a faithless man." [...] They were the words of Romola, in the romance, to Tito; she had often admired them; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> her equally the measure of Dan's offence.|$|E
6000|$|He murmured. [...] "Oh! It's me!" [...] blankly, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> become breathless together. Apparently he was pondering {{over what}} he had heard; then, without irritation, but evidently perplexed, he said: [...] "I don't understand. I hadn't written or anything. It's my chum who saw the paper and told me--this very morning.... Eh? what?" ...|$|E
60|$|Statira tottered against Lemuel, {{with that}} round, soft {{shoulder}} which had touched him before. He {{put out his}} arms to save her from falling, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> close round her of themselves. She threw up her face, {{and in a moment}} he had kissed her. He released her and fell back from her aghast.|$|E
50|$|United Nations spokeswomen Orla Clinton {{said that}} {{students}} {{had been killed in}} the attack <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have been students between 16 and 18, A-level students, from the Kilinochichi and Mullaittivu areas, who were on a two-day training course.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in the least; {{but as far}} as I {{can tell}} by the sound, they must be attacking us in force, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be working round in rear of our battery there. The sound is {{certainly}} coming this way." ...|$|R
50|$|The genus is {{generally}} {{native to the}} Holarctic and the Mediterranean region; their southern limit in Central Asia and the Himalaya region is less well understood, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> range outward {{a bit out of}} their core regions (e.g. into East Africa).|$|R
