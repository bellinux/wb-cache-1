5|$|After {{the flight}} test {{demonstration}} and {{validation of the}} prototypes, on 23 April 1991, Secretary of the USAF Donald Rice announced the YF-22 as {{the winner of the}} ATF competition. The YF-23 design was considered stealthier and faster, while the YF-22 was more maneuverable. The aviation press speculated that the YF-22 was also more <b>adaptable</b> <b>to</b> the U.S. Navy's Navalized Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), but by 1992, the Navy had abandoned NATF.|$|E
5|$|Brahmousin cattle are {{a hybrid}} {{purebred}} breed of Brahman and Limousin first {{created in the}} USA in the late 1970s. The goal was to blend {{the best of the}} Limousin and Brahman traits to create a breed that has reproductive efficiency, mothering ability, good muscling and growth traits, and is <b>adaptable</b> <b>to</b> varying environmental conditions. Brahmousin are now bred in the USA, Indonesia, El Salvador and Australia.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{economic}} foundations of Byzantium was trade, fostered by the maritime character of the Empire. Textiles must have been {{by far the most}} important item of export; silks were certainly imported into Egypt, and appeared also in Bulgaria, and the West. The state strictly controlled both the internal and the international trade, and retained the monopoly of issuing coinage, maintaining a durable and flexible monetary system <b>adaptable</b> <b>to</b> trade needs.|$|E
5|$|The golden {{everlasting}} {{has proven}} very <b>adaptable</b> <b>to</b> cultivation. It was propagated and developed in Germany in the 1850s, and annual cultivars {{in a host}} of colour forms from white to bronze to purple flowers became available. Many of these are still sold in mixed seed packs. In Australia, many cultivars are perennial shrubs, which have become popular garden plants. Sturdier, long-stemmed forms are used commercially in the cut flower industry.|$|E
5|$|Alloxylon flammeum is {{a canopy}} or {{emergent}} tree of the Mabi rainforest community of north Queensland. Its terminal tubular flowers {{indicate that the}} species is pollinated by birds. Readily <b>adaptable</b> <b>to</b> cultivation, Alloxylon flammeum prefers a site with good drainage and responds well to extra moisture and fertilisers low in phosphorus. It is listed nationally as vulnerable under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) as most of its habitat has been cleared for agriculture and logging.|$|E

5000|$|Hyperolius occidentalis is a {{very common}} species. It is <b>adaptable,</b> {{unlikely}} <b>to</b> face any significant threats, and probably occurs in several protected areas. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as of [...] "Least Concern".|$|R
5|$|Although {{they grow}} {{naturally}} on deep sandy soils, the species has proved <b>adaptable</b> <b>to</b> other deep, well-drained soils, especially where natural slopes assist drainage. Despite their natural occurrence in woodland, waratahs flower best in full sun, although they tolerate the dappled shade of eucalypts. Heavy pruning after flowering reinvigorates {{the plants and}} promotes more profuse flowering in the next season. Waratah blooms are highly susceptible to damage from wind, and benefit from some protection from prevailing winds. Waratah blooms attract birds to the garden. The species is readily propagated from fresh seed, but cultivars must be reproduced from cuttings to remain true-to-type.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{sketches}} were derived almost exclusively from the books, whose multimedia approach, consisting of short anecdotes interspersed with cartoons, diaries, newspaper articles and recipes, proved easily <b>adaptable</b> <b>to</b> the screen either {{as raw material}} or creative inspiration. In later series, as usable material from the books and other obvious sources began to run out, concepts were drawn from more standard historical texts under Jenner's supervision. He and fellow researchers read through many different studies and picked out suitably quirky, intriguing snippets, which were then pitched to the writers for development.|$|E
5|$|B.s. var.spinulosa 'Coastal Cushion' (= 'Schnapper Point') was {{originally}} collected by Neil Marriott and called 'Schnapper Point' {{from the same}} locality as 'Birthday Candles'. This is a more spreading plant to 50cm tall and up to 1.5–2m across with dark red-styled gold flowers (a couple of shades darker than 'Birthday Candles') 15cm high by 6cm across. It is propagated by Richard Anderson of Merricks Nursery. It {{appears to be more}} <b>adaptable</b> <b>to</b> points north than other dwarf forms – growing reliably in southeastern Queensland. This form can be very floriferous, with some plants sporting more than 40 inflorescences at any one time.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II, the United States Army Air Forces, {{which became}} the United States Air Force (USAF) in 1947, {{developed}} a requirement for a new, large assault glider type to replace smaller types that were then in service, all existing gliders having been declared obsolete. The new gliders were to be constructed entirely of metal, and were also required to be easily <b>adaptable</b> <b>to</b> a powered configuration. As part of a five-year development program, a contract was awarded to the Chase Aircraft Company of Trenton, New Jersey, in August 1946 {{for the construction of}} two types of gliders. These included a smaller model being designated XCG-18A, and the larger, definitive model being designated XCG-20.|$|E
5|$|Habitat loss has {{occurred}} through commercial harvesting of the sago, or conversion to rice cultivation and fishponds. The rail is a prized food for local people who catch it with traps made from strings of bark and hunt it with dogs. The only described nest {{was in an}} area well-used by local villagers, and the rail may be more <b>adaptable</b> <b>to</b> habitat changes than had been thought. There were also several sightings in northeast Halmahera in 2008 and 2011, extending {{the area in which}} this bird has been seen in recent years.|$|E
5|$|Of {{most vital}} {{importance}} to marshes are invertebrate animals, {{the foundation of}} food webs. Amphibious invertebrates such as apple snails (Pomacea paludosa), crayfish, and grass shrimp consume plant material, hastening its decomposition and acting as a food source for fish and birds. Insect larvae use water for breeding, feeding upon smaller copepods and amphipods that live in microscopic algae and periphyton formations. Mosquitos, born in water, are in turn the favorite food of 112 species of dragonflies and 44 species of damselflies in Florida. These animals are water hardy and <b>adaptable</b> <b>to</b> dry conditions when water levels fluctuate from one season to the next or through drought and flood cycles.|$|E

5|$|The {{red panda}} is quite <b>adaptable</b> <b>to</b> living in captivity, and {{is common in}} zoos worldwide. By 1992, more than 300 births had {{occurred}} in captivity, and more than 300 individuals lived in 85 institutions worldwide. By 2001, 182 individuals were in North American zoos alone. As of 2006, the international studbook listed more than 800 individuals in zoos and parks around the world. Of these, 511 individuals of subspecies A. f. fulgens were kept in 173 institutions and 306 individuals of subspecies A. f. styani were kept in 81 institutions.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} usually found in {{eucalyptus}} woodlands, or along water courses. In the more northerly {{parts of the}} country, these cockatoos are commonly seen in large flocks. They are seed eaters and cavity nesters, and as such depend on trees with fairly large diameters, generally Eucalyptus. Populations in southeastern Australia are threatened by deforestation and other habitat alterations. Of the black cockatoos, the red-tailed is the most <b>adaptable</b> <b>to</b> aviculture, although black cockatoos are much rarer and much more expensive in aviculture outside Australia.|$|E
5|$|The two {{contractor}} teams submitted evaluation {{results with}} their proposals in December 1990, and on 23 April 1991, Secretary of the Air Force Donald Rice {{announced that the}} YF-22 was the winner. The Air Force selected the YF119 engine to power the F-22 production version. The Lockheed and Pratt & Whitney designs were rated higher on technical aspects, were considered lower risks, and were considered to have more effective program management. It has been speculated in the aviation press that the YF-22 was also seen as more <b>adaptable</b> <b>to</b> the Navy's NATF, but by 1992 the U.S. Navy had abandoned NATF.|$|E

5|$|Artistic design, {{including}} {{character and}} monster creations, was handled by Japanese artist Yoshitaka Amano from Final Fantasy through Final FantasyVI. Amano also handled title logo designs {{for all of}} the main series and the image illustrations from Final FantasyVII onward. Tetsuya Nomura was chosen to replace Amano because Nomura's designs were more <b>adaptable</b> <b>to</b> 3D graphics. He worked with the series from Final FantasyVII through Final FantasyX; for Final FantasyIX, however, character designs were handled by Shukō Murase, Toshiyuki Itahana, and Shin Nagasawa. Nomura is also the character designer of the Kingdom Hearts series, Compilation of Final FantasyVII, and Fabula Nova Crystallis: Final Fantasy. Other designers include Nobuyoshi Mihara and Akihiko Yoshida. Mihara was the character designer for Final FantasyXI, and Yoshida served as character designer for Final Fantasy Tactics, the Square-produced Vagrant Story, and Final FantasyXII.|$|E
5|$|In the interim, {{rather than}} await a decision, Ferrari {{continued}} her studies. Between 1921 and 1923 she visited many clinics in Europe, including facilities in Austria, Belgium, England, France, Germany and Italy. She {{assisted in the}} clinic of Marie Curie in Paris {{as well as in}} the Columbia Hospital for Women and Lying-In Asylum in Washington, DC. The Faculty of Medicine of Paris awarded her the first diploma ever given to a woman for studies in urinary tract monitoring. In 1924, she designed a vaginoscope, which was much easier to sterilize and was more <b>adaptable</b> <b>to</b> multiple specula than previous models. The device significantly improved services which were available to women in Brazil, and was featured in the articles of the Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics of Rio de Janeiro. The innovation won the Grand Prize at the 1924 Congreso Hispano Lusitano Americano de Ciencias Médicas held in Seville, Spain.|$|E
5|$|On 23April1991, the YF-22 was {{announced}} by Secretary of the Air Force Donald Rice {{as the winner}} of the ATF competition. The YF-23 design was stealthier and faster, but the YF-22 was more agile. It was speculated in the aviation press that the YF-22 was also seen as more <b>adaptable</b> <b>to</b> the Navy's Navalized Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), but the US Navy abandoned NATF by 1992. Instead of being retired, as with the case of PAV-1, PAV-2 subsequently flew sorties following the competition – it amassed another 61.6 flying hours during 39 flights. On 25April1992, the aircraft sustained serious damage during a landing attempt as a result of pilot-induced oscillations. It was repaired but never flew again, and instead served as a static test vehicle thereafter. In 1991, it was anticipated that 650 production F-22s would be procured.|$|E
