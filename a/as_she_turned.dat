5|$|As Minerve {{turned back}} towards the British convoy with the {{intention}} of cutting off the rearmost ships, Astell passed her more damaged companions to become the first ship in line. This left Windham, now at the rear, to face Minerve alone. Fortunately for Stewart, Minerve lost two topmasts <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> to face his ship and had to pull away from the British to effect repairs. An hour and a half later, at 18:30, Bellone joined the action, attacking Windham directly. Victor supported Bellone and accompanied the flagship as she moved ahead to attack Ceylon and Astell. By 19:00, with Ceylon damaged so severely that she could no longer effectively sail or fight, third officer Tristam Fleming hauled the ship out of the battle line and ordered his crew to cease firing: Meriton and his second officer Thomas Oldham had both been seriously wounded by grape shot.|$|E

500|$|Emerald and Amethyst {{had more}} {{success in the}} spring of 1809 when on 23 March they {{captured}} the brigs Caroline and Serpent. In April, Emerald assisted Amethyst in the chase of a large 44-gun frigate off Ushant. Emerald sighted , with a main battery of 18-pounders and under the command of Captain Dupoter, at 11:00 on 5 April and immediately signalled Amethyst for assistance. Amethyst {{caught a glimpse of the}} French forty-four just <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> away to the south-east and gave chase but by 19:20 had lost sight of both Niemen and Emerald. Amethyst fell in with Niemen again at around 21:30 and engaged her. Niemen was forced to strike when a second British frigate, [...] came into view and fired a broadside. The Royal Navy took Niemen into service under her existing name.|$|E
500|$|Sonja Henie of Norway won {{her third}} {{straight}} {{gold medal in}} the ladies' singles figure skating event, her last Olympic medal <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> professional shortly after the Games.

500|$|Quincy {{had also}} seen the {{aircraft}} flares over the southern ships, received Pattersons warning, {{and had just}} sounded general quarters and was coming alert when the searchlights from the Japanese column came on. Quincys captain gave the order to commence firing, but the gun crews were not ready. Within a few minutes, Quincy {{was caught in a}} crossfire between Aoba, Furutaka, and Tenryū, and was hit heavily and set afire. Quincys captain ordered his cruiser to charge towards the eastern Japanese column, but <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> to do so Quincy was hit by two torpedoes from Tenryū, causing severe damage. Quincy managed to fire a few main gun salvos, one of which hit Chōkais chart room 6 meters (20ft) from Admiral Mikawa and killed or wounded 36 men, although Mikawa was not injured. At 02:10, incoming shells killed or wounded almost all of Quincys bridge crew, including the captain. At 02:16, the cruiser was hit by a torpedo from Aoba, and the ship's remaining guns were silenced.

500|$|In their {{review of}} the show, The Age commented that Minogue was able to emulate Bardot's {{appearance}} well and wrote: [...] " [...] looked the spitting image of Brigitte Bardot <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> a corner of west London into Paris for the evening." [...] Andy Battaglia from the A.V. Club complimented the staging and performances as [...] "sharp and kinetic," [...] although he also felt that the [...] "little bits of stage banter deflate an aesthetic otherwise set on air-lock." [...] Billboard critic Keith Caulfield praised the concert show as [...] "extravagant" [...] and opined {{that it should have}} been a part of a [...] "mammoth" [...] arena tour. Writing for the Sydney Morning Herald, Greg Hassall gave a favourable review of Money Can't Buy and summarised it as [...] "lots of '80s-influenced electro-pop, with a few oldies thrown in for good measure." [...] People magazine complimented the visuals but felt Minogue's vocals were [...] "electronically enhanced." [...] Craig McLean from the Daily Telegraph called Money Can't Buy a [...] "real tour de force" [...] and noticed that the tracks from Body Language were more low-key than songs from her previous albums, describing them as [...] "sedate and immaculate dancefloor rhythm" [...] and [...] "All very stylish and considerably more affecting than the similarly nostalgic Sophie Ellis-Bextor." [...] Mclean praised the incorporation of the past songs as they provided [...] "the huge choruses for which the nation loves her so," [...] and concluded of the show: [...] "No slinky back-arching or pristine choreography here: just the giddy joy of pop music at play." ...|$|E
2500|$|The initial episodes {{following}} {{the introduction of}} Seven of Nine showed Captain Janeway mirroring {{the actions of the}} Borg <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> down Seven's request to be returned to the collective. Abducting Seven was also suggested to be a [...] "tough-love" [...] scenario with Janeway taking the place of Seven's mother, while the Doctor posed as her father. It was this new family relationship that later caused the Borg Queen to modify her tactics to re-assimilate Seven in the episode [...] "Dark Frontier", by simulating a mother-daughter relationship. The Doctor, Seven and Janeway relationship was also compared to Pygmalion showing Galatea to Venus {{in the way that the}} Doctor re-humanised Seven during the events of [...] "The Gift".|$|E

2500|$|On March 31, Selena woke {{up early}} to meet Saldivar {{at the motel}} where she was staying. She met with Saldivar, who delayed the {{transfer}} of papers with a story about having been raped in Mexico. Selena took Saldivar to a local hospital, where doctors {{found no evidence of}} rape. When they returned to the motel room, Selena ended their four-year working relationship. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> to leave, Saldivar reached into her handbag, pulled out a Taurus Model 85 [...]38 caliber revolver, pointed it at Selena and pulled the trigger. The bullet entered Selena's right shoulder blade from the back, piercing a major artery running from her heart and exiting from just below her right collarbone. She ran to the motel lobby and collapsed to the floor. As the motel employees gathered round, she named Saldivar as her assailant. Selena was transferred to a nearby hospital, where doctors found the damage irreparable. She was pronounced dead within the hour.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 April, the {{submarine}} surfaced in a downpour to continue patrols north of West Fayu Island. Later that day, {{she set her}} course to intercept a convoy reported to be southwest of Truk. At 22:28 on 9 April, she made radar contact with a formation less than three miles (5km) distant and went to four engines to maneuver into position for an attack. In a few minutes, the formation changed course, putting Tunny in position to slow down to two-thirds speed and head in, flooded down to decks awash to avoid detection. As the convoy became visible, Tunnys commanding officer, Commander James A. Scott, could hardly believe his luck. On the starboard bow was a large aircraft carrier, to port two auxiliary carriers, and on each bow of the formation, a destroyer. Given this perfect setup, Tunny maneuvered to swing the bow on twin targets, but her plans were disrupted when three small boats similar to motor torpedo boats appeared only [...] off her port bow. Tunny quickly dove to , turned right, ninety degrees, and launched four torpedoes from her stern tubes {{at one of the}} auxiliary carriers from a distance of [...] <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> her attention to other targets, four torpedo explosions sounded through the night.|$|E
