25|$|The story {{centers around}} three seamen who conduct shady {{business}} on board their vessel, Sandy Hook. The film starts {{with two of}} them, Tom Jansen (Helge Jordal) and Sverre (Hans Ola Sørlie), taking tourists on a polar bear safari. During this trip and at a later scene at a pub in Longyearbyen, where Tom's girlfriend, Eva Jelseth (Kjersti Holmen) is introduced, the viewers are briefed {{on the politics of}} Svalbard and the large Soviet presence. The third seaman, Lars (Sverre Anker Ousdal), presents plans to freight a bulldozer to the mainland from Sarstangen. They have been instructed to dump the bulldozer underway as part of an insurance fraud scheme, but have instead made arrangements to sell the vehicle on Greenland. While at port, Tom is called to visit Governor Bache (Jon Eikemo), who warns that he will be keeping <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
500|$|A link {{developed}} during the war with the King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC), whose Southern Rhodesian contingent—numbering a few hundred, chiefly in its 2nd and 3rd Battalions—was the largest on the Western Front. The connection with this particular corps began {{as the result of}} a chance conversation aboard the ship that took the first batch of Southern Rhodesians from Cape Town to Southampton in late 1914. The 16th Marquess of Winchester, who had links with Rhodesia dating back to the 1890s, was also aboard the ship, returning from a visit to the colony. Encountering Captain John Banks Brady, the officer of Irish origin who led the volunteers, the Marquess asked where his party was headed. Brady enthusiastically replied that they were going to war together in France. The Marquess suggested to Brady that since it might be difficult to prevent his men from being split up during the enlistment process, it might be a good idea for the Rhodesians to join the KRRC, where he could keep <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> through his connections with the Winchester-based regiment. The Southern Rhodesian contingent duly mustered into the KRRC. A designated Rhodesian platoon, widely referred to thereafter as [...] "the Rhodesian Platoon", was formed under Brady at the KRRC training camp at Sheerness, on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent.|$|E
2500|$|Gatecrashing a local talent {{night at}} the All Saints Hall, Notting Hill, they were so disorganised as to not even have a name, opting for [...] "Group X" [...] at the last minute, nor any songs, {{choosing}} to play an extended 20-minute jam on The Byrds' [...] "Eight Miles High." [...] BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel was in the audience and was impressed enough to tell event organiser, Douglas Smith, to keep <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them.</b> Smith signed them up and got them a deal with Liberty Records {{on the back of}} a deal he was setting up for Cochise.|$|E

2500|$|During his escape, Jaishankar had {{fractured}} his leg while {{jumping from}} the 30 feet {{wall of the}} prison compound. He had taken care not to contact his family in Tamil Nadu, assuming that the police would keep <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them.</b> Soon after his escape, a police informant managed {{to get in touch}} with him. The informant lured him to a dilapidated building near [...] the Kudlu gate in Bangalore, with the promise of a motorbike to facilitate his escape outside the city. There, the police arrested Jaishankar, on the noon of 6 September 2013. The Government spent over [...] 75,000 treating his fractured leg at the Victoria Hospital, where he was operated on, on 23 September.|$|E

Kraljević denounced the agreement stating [...] "we implore all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially Croats and Bosniaks, not {{to take into account}} any statements or agreements between Mate Boban and Radovan Karadžić. Neither speaks in the name of Croats and Bosniaks. They do not represent what the Croats and Bosniaks want.... HOS and the TO are defending, and will defend, Bosnia and Herzegovina."

60|$|Miss Jewell {{expressed}} her relief {{the next}} evening, and, stealing {{a glance at}} the face of the skipper, experienced a twinge of something which she took to be remorse.

60|$|He did {{not tell}} the lads that he had been asked to keep <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them,</b> fearing the {{information}} would not be to their liking. He was not to interfere with any of their movements unless he that they were running into positive danger.|$|E
60|$|With that I {{saw what}} {{appeared}} to be another swordfish, deeper down, moving slowly. This one also looked huge to me. He was right under the teasers. It dawned upon me that he must have <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them,</b> so I began to pull them in.|$|E

50|$|Very {{little is}} known about the monsters, mainly because very few have ever been seen. They are {{obviously}} the dominant species of Planet U.

50|$|Unbeknownst to the children, by {{that time}} the doctor knows very well who they are and where they are living; indeed, he has been keeping <b>a</b> {{discreet}} <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> for weeks.

50|$|Any {{motive for}} the killings is not yet known. Neighbors said the parents home-schooled their {{children}} and kept <b>a</b> close <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them,</b> disallowing them from mingling with neighbors or other children.

6000|$|Jacobs {{laughed and}} answered, [...] "Not much risk," [...] {{and went out}} with Guy. To Jean their action seemed foolhardy. He kept <b>a</b> keen <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> and saw {{instantly}} when the band became aware of Guy's and Jacobs's entrance into the pasture. It took only another second then to realize that Daggs and Jorth had deadly intent. Jean saw Daggs slip out of his saddle, rifle in hand. Others of the gang did likewise, until half of them were dismounted.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Rupert St. Leger, who {{was looking}} all this time angrier than even the {{attorney}} or my father--though at {{what he had to}} be angry about I can't imagine--struck his fist on the table and rose up as if to speak, but as he caught sight of both old MacKelpie and the attorney he sat down again. Mem.--Those three seem to agree too well. I must keep <b>a</b> sharp <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them.</b> I didn't think of this part any more at the time, for father asked another question which interested me much: ...|$|R

6000|$|He exclaimed: [...] "I say!" [...] But after {{studying}} my {{face for a}} while accepted my terms with a faint grimace. It seems that these people could not exist without potatoes. I could. I didn't {{want to see a}} potato as long as I lived; but the demon of lucre had taken possession of me. How the news got about I don't know, but, returning on board rather late, I found a small group of men of the coster type hanging about the waist, while Mr. Burns walked to and fro the quarterdeck loftily, keeping <b>a</b> triumphant <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them.</b> They had come to buy potatoes.|$|R
60|$|At this Charley cast off, and Yellow Handkerchief sent {{one of his}} men {{forward to}} haul in the line. In the {{gathering}} darkness I {{could just make out}} the mouth of San Rafael Creek, {{and by the time we}} entered it I could barely see its banks. The Reindeer was fully five minutes astern, and we continued to leave her astern as we beat up the narrow, winding channel. With Charley behind us, it seemed I had little to fear from my five prisoners; but the darkness prevented my keeping <b>a</b> sharp <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them,</b> so I transferred my revolver from my trousers pocket to the side pocket of my coat, where I could more quickly put my hand on it.|$|R
50|$|George Augustus and Caroline had a {{successful}} and loving marriage, though he continued to keep mistresses, as was customary for the time. Caroline {{was well aware of}} his infidelities, as they were well known and he told her about them. His two best-known mistresses were Henrietta Howard, later Countess of Suffolk, and, from 1735, Amalie von Wallmoden, Countess of Yarmouth. Howard was one of Caroline's Women of the Bedchamber and became Mistress of the Robes when her husband inherited a peerage in 1731; she retired in 1734. In contrast with her mother-in-law and husband, Caroline was known for her marital fidelity; she never made any embarrassing scenes nor did she take lovers. She preferred her husband's mistresses to be ladies-in-waiting, as that way she believed she could keep <b>a</b> closer <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Sykes {{began his}} {{broadcast}} career at BBC Radio Oxford while studying at The Queen's College, Oxford University. [...] From there {{he went on}} to work for LBC from 1973-74. [...] After that he joined the BBC where he has continually worked since. His first regular BBC work was as a continuity announcer and presenter/reporter for the BBC West TV region. On Halloween in 1977, he received a written warning from BBC management in Bristol after he had ended the closedown routine at 1.20 am (following a Vince Price horror film, The Tomb of Ligeia) by using a 500 watt uplight to cast spectral shadows across his face as he warned any viewers with black cats to keep <b>a</b> close <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> that night in case they were abducted by witches.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} Hooty and Mrs. Hooty, at their hooked bills and great claws, {{and decided that}} he would take a stout stick along with him. He had no desire to feel these great claws. When he had found a stick to suit him, he began to climb the tree. Hooty and Mrs. Hooty snapped their bills and hissed fiercely. They drew nearer. Farmer Brown's boy kept <b>a</b> watchful <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them.</b> They looked so big and fierce that he was almost tempted to give up and leave them in peace. But he just had to find out if there was {{anything}} in that nest, so he kept on. As he drew near it, Mrs. Hooty swooped very near to him, and the snap of her bill made an ugly sound. He held his stick ready to strike and kept on.|$|R
5|$|Savige's {{sixth and}} last {{campaign}} {{of the war}} was free of controversy about his command. Once again, he had a talented regular officer as chief of staff, Brigadier Ragnar Garrett, with whom he had worked in Greece during 1941 and more recently in New Guinea. Moreover, as a corps commander, tactical details could be left to subordinates, although Savige still had to keep <b>a</b> close <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> to ensure that they did not take unnecessary risks or incur needless casualties. Savige continued to tour the front lines wearing his scarlet cap band and flying his car flag. He also maintained his concern for, and rapport with, the ordinary soldiers under his command. The final campaign on Bougainville cost 516Australian lives. Some 8,500Japanese were killed while 9,800died of other causes, leaving 23,571still alive when the war ended. On 8September 1945, Savige accepted their surrender at Torokina.|$|R
