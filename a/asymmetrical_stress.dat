These deformities have been hypothesized to be correlated to both the size and shape of their tank.

[3 - 5] In this work, all-manganite [Pr 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 MnO 3 /La 0. 5 Ca 0. 5 MnO 3] 20 superlattices were epitaxially fabricated on (001) -oriented single crystal MgO substrates with 24 nm La 0. 5 Ca 0. 5 MnO 3 buffer layer by using plused laser deposition. All the as-grown superlattices are of single phase and single orientation (see Fig. 1). We obtained various stress at interface by varying relative layer thickness. As the thickness of Pr 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 MnO 3 layer and La 0. 5 Ca 0. 5 MnO 3 layer is not identical, interlayer-induced <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>stress</b> will occur and result in lower metal-insulator (MI) transition temperature and larger magnetoresistance (MR) in a wider temperature range. This result indicated that [Pr 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 MnO 3 /La 0. 5 Ca 0. 5 MnO 3] 20 has opportunities for practical application in magnetic sensor and magnetic memory material. Furthermore, the percolation model {{has been used to}} quantitatively understand the transport mechanism of superlattice (see Fig. 2).

40|$|The {{numerical}} {{analysis of the}} tense condition of a solid body with the asymmetrical tensor of strains Vasile Ceban, Ion Naval Abstract. In this paper an approach permitting to make calculation of non-steady fields of elastic bodies with an <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>stress</b> tensor is proposed. On the basis of integral equations the explicit difference network, founded on S. K. Godunov method named ”disintegrations of a gap ” is constructed. The versions are considered, when the difference network approximates an initial set of equations with {{the first and second}} order of accuracy. Mathematics subject classification: 74 H 15. Keywords and phrases: <b>Asymmetrical</b> <b>stress</b> tensor. The classical theory of elasticity is based on the model of a solid body in which interaction between particles is realized only by central forces. However, it is impossible to explain satisfactorily the regularities of some phe-nomena, for instance, the spreading of the short acoustic waves in a crystalline solid body, polycrystalline metal and high polymer. The theoretical results do not give satisfactory concordance with experimental data for a body with obviously expressed polycrystalline structure, in the complex tense condition with high gradient of the tension. The model elaborated for the explanation of these phenomena differers from classical one by the fact that tense condition on elementary platform is characterized alongside with the vector of the power tension by the vector of moment tension, referred to the same unit platform as the vector of the usual tension. The model of elastic moments medium was created in which infinitely small volume possesses six degrees of freedom, and the interaction between elements of the medium is realized by power and moments tensions [1 – 4]. Here we are concentrated on the consideration of the variant in which the motion of the medium point is completely described by the vector of the onward displace-ment, but the vector of the angular tumbling is equal to the local rotation of the medium {{in the sense of the}} usual theory of elasticity, i. e. −→ω =...|$|E

40|$|The aetiology, {{in terms}} of both {{initiation}} and progression, of the deformity in idiopathic scoliosis is at present unclear. Even in neuromuscular cases, the mechanisms underlying progression are not fully elucidated. It is thought, however, that asymmetrical loading is involved in the progression of the disease, with evidence mainly from animal studies and modelling. There is, however, very little direct information as to the origin or mechanism of action of these forces in the scoliotic spine. This review describes the concept of intervertebral disc pressure or stress and examines possible measurement techniques. The biological and mechanical consequences of abnormalities in these parameters are described. Future possible studies and their clinical significance are also briefly discussed. Techniques of pressure measurement have culminated in the development of 'pressure profilometry', which provides stress profiles across the disc in mutually perpendicular axes. A hydrated intervertebral disc exhibits mainly hydrostatic behaviour. However, in pathological states such as degeneration and scoliosis, non-hydrostatic behaviour predominates and annular peaks of stress occur. Recent studies have shown that, in scoliosis, high hydrostatic pressures are seen with <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>stresses</b> from concave to convex sides. These abnormalities could influence both disc and endplate cellular activity directly, causing asymmetrical growth and matrix changes. In addition, disc cells could be influenced via nutritional changes consequent to end-plate calcification. Evidence suggests that the stress environment of the scoliotic disc is abnormal, probably generated by high and asymmetrical loading of non-muscular origin. If present in the scoliotic spine during daily activities, this could generate a positive feedback of cellular changes, resulting in curve progression. Future advances in understanding may rely on the development of computer models owing to the difficulties of in-vivo invasive measurements...|$|R

It was found that a similar premature failure would occur during the ratchetting process for 9 - 12 % chromium steels. In order to understand the physical origins of this premature failure, a study of microstructure evolutions in a high Cr ferrite steel under the creep-fatigue cyclic loadings by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations is carried out in this paper. Results show that the occurrence of additional fatigue damage in the long term tests, which seems to come from the unstable dislocation lath structure, is the main cause of premature breakdown.

In this study plasticity-induced stress errors are numerically evaluated for a benchmark edge-welded beam to understand the underlying mechanism. Welding and cutting are sequentially simulated by finite element models which have been validated by previous experimental results. It is found that a cutting direction normal to the symmetry plane of the residual stress distribution {{can lead to}} a substantially <b>asymmetrical</b> back-calculated <b>stress</b> distribution, owing to cutting-induced plasticity. In general, the stresses at sample edges are most susceptible to error, particularly when the sample is restrained during cutting. Inadequate clamping (far from the plane of cut) can lead to highly concentrated plastic deformation in local regions, and consequently the back-calculated stresses have exceptionally high values and gradients at these locations. Furthermore, the overall stress distribution is skewed towards the end-of-cut side. Adequate clamping (close to the plane of cut) minimises errors in back-calculated stress which becomes insensitive to the cutting direction. For minimal constraint (i. e. solely preventing rigid body motion), the plastic deformation is relatively smoothly distributed, and an optimal cutting direction (i. e. cutting from the base material towards the weld region in a direction that falls within the residual stress symmetry plane) is identified by evaluating the magnitude of stress errors. These findings suggest that cutting process information is important for the evaluation of potential plasticity-induced errors in contour method results, and that the cutting direction and clamping strategy can be optimised with an understanding of their effects on plasticity and hence the back-calculated stresses...|$|R

Early hominid vocalization was a type of pant-hoot in which vocalization was done during inhalation as well as exhalation (biphasic vocalization). The asymmetrical pulsing {{of this type of}} vocalization developed into meters in language and beats in music. I suggest that at least some aspects of human language evolved from sexual and/or hierarchical displays, where complexity would be advantageous. The complexity took the form of increased structuring and, with the move from biphasic vocalization to vocalization during exhalation, increased duration and modulation of the complex vocalizations. The asymmetrical pulses of biphasic voicing were preserved in the characteristic feature of human syllables as being strong or weak. Furthermore, while vowels carry prosodic information such as pitch and intensity, consonants were initially needed to mark a division between the pulses during exhaled-only speech. Initially, syllables took the form CV, a form that is ubiquitous in languages and during language acquisition by children. Because of the lack of direct evidence for language evolution, we are forced to use indirect evidence including: (1) Looking at the evolution and function of vocal communication in other distantly related species, such as birds; (2) Comparing human communication with primate communication; (3) Look at neural functioning in humans and non-human primates during communication; (4) Looking at the development of language in human children...|$|R

The human aorta and {{coronary arteries}} are susceptible to arterial disease, and there have been many studies of flows in models of these vessels. However, previous work has been limited in that investigations have not modeled both the geometry and flow conditions in specific individuals. The first aim of the research was to develop a methodology that combined computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to simulate the blood flow patterns found in the human aorta. The methodology included MR image processing, 3 D model reconstruction and flow simulation using in vivo velocity boundary conditions obtained from phase contrast (PC) -MRI scanning. The CFD simulations successfully reproduce the unusual right-hand helical flow pattern that has been reported in the ascending aorta, giving confidence in the accuracy of the methodology. The second aim was to investigate the causes of the right-hand helical flow. It was found that the correct flow dynamics could only be produced by including the specific aortic motion caused by the beating heart; and it is concluded that this is a significant factor in producing the observed in vivo helical flow patterns. The entrance flows of coronary arteries are expected to be affected by flow in the aortic root, and the third aim was to explore these effects using models that include aorta and coronary arteries. The simulation results demonstrate that a pair of axial vortexes with different rotating directions exists in the entrance segments of the right and left coronary arteries during systole and early diastole, producing <b>asymmetrical</b> wall shear <b>stress</b> (WSS) distributions.

40|$|Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) {{is a very}} {{interesting}} material due to its number of applications, e. g., high dielectric constant, photocatalytic application. The photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 was first demonstrated in 1972. TiO 2 has a wide band gap (3. 0 - 3. 2 eV), thus most of the absorption occurs in the UV range, where solar spectrum consists of only 5 - 8 %. It is of immense importance to enhance its photocatalytic activity in the visible part of the solar spectrum. This requires band gap tailoring, which can be achieved by doping. However, finding a suitable dopant for TiO 2 is quite critical. In the present work, structural properties and chemical composition of the Nd doped sputter deposited TiO 2 thin films were studied by varying the Nd concentrations from 0 to 2 at. % using RF sputtering. The results suggested that the incorporation of Nd produced stresses in lattice, which shifted diffraction peaks to a lower 2 Â£c values, reduction in crystallite size, elongation of lattice along c-axis and specific texturing along (004) plane. Raman spectroscopy also confirmed asymmetry of bonds. Theoretical modeling of structure was also performed using VESTA code. SEM images confirmed the transformation of faceted to planar surface. XPS showed the presence of O vacancies and non-stoichiometry in films with increased dopant concentration. V doping in the TiO 2 films also displayed interesting results as V existed in many oxidation states with different ionic radii. With the addition of V, preferential growth along (211) plane occurred. The morphology was transformed from faceted to small elongated grains as the concentration of V increased. The substitution of V in place of Ti made the V. O bonds <b>asymmetrical,</b> which created <b>stress</b> to modify the crystallite and grain sizes. XPS showed low binding energy (L. B. E.) shift and an increase in the (ï¿½’Â´) B. E. difference of Ti- 2 p doublet peaks, which was due to increased nonstoichiometry in the films. This was also attributed to the substitution of V in the V 3 + and V 5 + states. Raman spectroscopy confirmed the increase in nonstoichiometry, phonon confinement, and asymmetry in the bonding with the increase in V concentration. This was also evident in the PL spectra, where strong contributions came from the states associated with V 5 + and V 3 + and dominated the spectra on oxygen vacancies (OV) and defect associated PL. Finally, the role of oxygen concentration and doping concentration in affecting the structural, phase transformation and chemical composition was studied using pulsed laser deposition (PLD). Oxygen partial pressure was varied from 100 mtorr (O 2 rich) to 0 mtorr (O 2 absent) and three concentrations of Nd were used as 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0 at. %. With the variation of oxygen and dopant concentrations, a sequence of phase transformations was observed. This also reduced the crystallite size and caused the film thickness to reduce. A reduction of Ti (Ti 4 + to Ti 3 +) was observed and emergence of the O vacancies and consequently generation of nonstoichiometry in TiO 2 lattice, which resulted in the short range ordering of the TiO 2 structure. The present work suggested that the incorporation of Nd inhibits the phase transformation, which can be allowed by increasing the oxygen partial pressures...|$|R
