50|$|Many Microsoft Windows applications—including many {{of those}} from Microsoft itself, such as Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Visual Studio, and Windows Media Player—use <b>ActiveX</b> <b>controls</b> to build their feature-set and also {{encapsulate}} their own functionality as <b>ActiveX</b> <b>controls</b> which can then be embedded into other applications. Internet Explorer also allows the embedding of <b>ActiveX</b> <b>controls</b> in web pages.|$|R

50|$|Despite Microsoft's {{previous}} {{efforts to}} make ActiveX cross-platform, most <b>ActiveX</b> <b>controls</b> will not work on all platforms, so using <b>ActiveX</b> <b>controls</b> to implement essential functionality of a web page restricts its usefulness. South Korea has started to remove this technology from their public websites {{in order to make}} their web site accessible to more platforms.|$|R
25|$|Unlike {{the main}} C API of QuickTime {{where it is}} {{necessary}} to call MoviesTask in a loop to load a media file, DirectShow handles all of this in a transparent way. It creates several background threads that smoothly play the requested file or URL without much work required from the programmer. Also in contrast to QuickTime, nothing special is required for loading a URL instead of a local file on diskDirectShow's filter graph abstracts these details from the programmer, although recent developments in QuickTime (including an <b>ActiveX</b> <b>control)</b> have reduced this disparity.|$|E
25|$|Developers rarely create DirectShow filters from scratch. Rather, {{they employ}} DirectShow Base Classes. The Base Classes can often simplify development, {{allowing}} the programmer to bypass certain tasks. However, the process may remain relatively complex; the code {{found in the}} Base Classes is nearly {{half the size of}} the entire MFC library. As a result, even with the Base Classes, the number of COM objects that DirectShow contains often overwhelms developers. In some cases, DirectShow's API deviates from traditional COM rules, particularly with regard to the parameters used for methods. To overcome their difficulties with DirectShow's unique COM rules, developers often turn to a higher level API that uses DirectShow, notably, Windows Media Player SDK, an API provides the developer with an <b>ActiveX</b> <b>Control</b> that has fewer COM interfaces to deal with.|$|E
25|$|Version 7 is {{intended}} to defend users from phishing as well as deceptive or malicious software, and it also features full user control of ActiveX and better security framework, including not being integrated as much with Windows as previous versions, thereby increasing security. Unlike previous versions, the Internet Explorer <b>ActiveX</b> <b>control</b> is not hosted in the Windows Explorer process, but rather it runs in its own process. It also includes bug fixes, enhancements to its support for web standards, tabbed browsing with tab preview and management, a multiple-engine search box, a web feeds reader, Internationalized Domain Name support (IDN), and antiphishing filter. On October 5, 2007, Microsoft removed the 'genuine software' validation before install, which means that all versions of Windows, whether able to pass validation or not, are able to install the browser. The integrated search box supports OpenSearch.|$|E

2500|$|Internet Explorer {{is fully}} {{configurable}} using Group Policy. [...] Administrators of Windows Server domains (for domain-joined computers) or the local computer can apply and enforce {{a variety of}} settings on computers that affect the user interface (such as disabling menu items and individual configuration options), as well as underlying security features such as downloading of files, zone configuration, per-site settings, <b>ActiveX</b> <b>control</b> behaviour and others. [...] Policy settings can be configured for each user and for each machine. Internet Explorer also supports Integrated Windows Authentication.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first version}} of the Windows Update web site (usually {{referred}} to as [...] "v3") did not require any personally-identifiable information {{to be sent to}} Microsoft. [...] In order for the v3 <b>ActiveX</b> <b>control</b> to determine what updates were needed, the entire list of available software on Windows Update was downloaded to the user's computer when they visited the Windows Update web site. [...] As the number of updates offered by Windows Update grew, this resulted in performance concerns. Arie Slob, writing for the Windows-help.net newsletter in March 2003, noted that the size of the update list had exceeded 400KB, which caused delays of more than a minute for dial-up users.|$|E
2500|$|Windows Update {{requires}} Internet Explorer or {{a third-party}} web browser that uses Microsoft's MSHTML layout engine, {{as it must}} {{support the use of}} an <b>ActiveX</b> <b>control</b> to house the software that is executed on the user's computer. [...] While details have changed from version to version, it has always scanned the computer to find what operating system components and software are installed, and compared the versions of those components with the latest available versions. [...] The ActiveX component then executes the downloaded installation files in their silent/unattended mode to install or update those components, and to report {{the success or failure of}} those installations back to Microsoft's servers.|$|E
50|$|ActiveX is a {{software}} framework created by Microsoft that adapts its earlier Component Object Model (COM) and Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) technologies for content downloaded from a network, {{particularly from the}} World Wide Web. Microsoft introduced ActiveX in 1996. In principle, ActiveX is not dependent on Microsoft Windows operating systems, but in practice most <b>ActiveX</b> <b>controls</b> only run on Windows. Most also require the client to be running on an x86-based computer because <b>ActiveX</b> <b>controls</b> contain compiled code.|$|R

2500|$|Sony BMG quickly {{released}} {{software to}} remove the rootkit component of XCP from affected Microsoft Windows computers, but after Russinovich analyzed the utility, he reported in his blog that it only exacerbated the security problems and raised further concerns about privacy. Russinovich noted that the removal program merely unmasked the hidden files installed by the rootkit, but did not actually remove the rootkit. He also reported that it installed additional software {{that could not be}} uninstalled. In order to download the uninstaller, he found it was necessary to provide an e-mail address (which the Sony BMG Privacy Policy implied was added to various bulk e-mail lists), and to install an <b>ActiveX</b> <b>control</b> containing backdoor methods (marked as [...] "safe for scripting", and thus prone to exploits).|$|E
2500|$|Windows Update v4, {{released}} {{in conjunction with}} Windows XP in 2001, changed this by having the <b>ActiveX</b> <b>control</b> submit {{a list of the}} hardware components to Microsoft's servers, which then returns a list of only those device drivers available for that machine. [...] It also narrowed down the list of available updates for the operating system and related components by sending details of what operating system version, service pack, and locale are installed. [...] German technology web site tecchannel.de published an analysis of the Windows Update communication protocol in February 2003, which received wide attention on technology web sites. [...] The report, which was the first to contain extensive details of how the Windows Update communication protocol worked, also discovered that the make and model of the computer, the amount of free disk space, and the Windows product key, were sent.|$|E
2500|$|Silverlight {{supports}} H.264 video, Advanced Audio Coding, Windows Media Video (WMV), Windows Media Audio (WMA), and MPEG Layer III (MP3) media content {{across all}} supported browsers without requiring Windows Media Player, the Windows Media Player <b>ActiveX</b> <b>control,</b> or Windows Media browser plug-ins. Because Windows Media Video 9 is an {{implementation of the}} Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) VC-1 standard, Silverlight also supports VC-1 video. According to the {{end user license agreement}} VC-1 and H.264 are only licensed for the [...] "personal and non-commercial use of a consumer". Silverlight makes it possible to dynamically load Extensible Markup Language (XML) content that can be manipulated through a Document Object Model (DOM) interface, a technique that is consistent with conventional Ajax techniques. Silverlight exposes a Downloader object which can be used to download content, like scripts, media assets, or other data, as may be required by the application. With version 2, the programming logic can be written in any [...]NET language, including some derivatives of common dynamic programming languages like IronRuby and IronPython.|$|E

40|$|National audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to warn Mozilla Firefox users about the risk {{associated}} with browser extensions, especially the fact that Firefox extensions are more dangerous than <b>ActiveX</b> <b>controls</b> in Internet Explorer. Interestingly, the lack of security of <b>ActiveX</b> <b>controls</b> is well known whereas the security of Firefox extensions seems to be ignored. This danger is platform-independant, Microsoft Windows as well as Mac OS and Linux are vulnerable as long as Firefox is used. Finally, we only consider Firefox but virtually every Mozilla application implementing an extension mechanism is subject to this threat, such as Thunderbird...|$|R
