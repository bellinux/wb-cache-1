25|$|<b>Ammonium</b> <b>carbamate</b> {{solutions}} are notoriously corrosive to metallic construction materials, even more resistant forms of stainless steel—especially in the hottest {{parts of the}} plant such as the stripper. Traditionally corrosion has been minimized (although not eliminated) by continuously injecting {{a small amount of}} oxygen (as air) into the plant to establish and maintain a passive oxide layer on exposed stainless steel surfaces. Because the carbon dioxide feed is recovered from ammonia synthesis gas, it contains traces of hydrogen that can mingle with passivation air to form an explosive mixture if allowed to accumulate.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of the equilibrium in the carbamate formation/decomposition depends on {{the product of the}} partial pressures of the reactants. In the total recycle processes, carbamate decomposition is promoted by reducing the overall pressure, which reduces the partial pressure of both ammonia and carbon dioxide. It is possible, however, to achieve a similar effect without lowering the overall pressure—by suppressing the partial pressure of just one of the reactants. Instead of feeding carbon dioxide gas directly to the reactor with the ammonia, as in the total recycle process, the stripping process first routes the carbon dioxide through a stripper (a carbamate decomposer that operates under full system pressure and configured to provide maximum gas-liquid contact). This flushes out free ammonia, reducing its partial pressure over the liquid surface and carrying it directly to a carbamate condenser (also under full system pressure). From there, reconstituted <b>ammonium</b> <b>carbamate</b> liquor passes directly to the reactor. That eliminates the medium-pressure stage of the total recycle process altogether.|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} properties of five siloxane polymers with different types and frequencies of amino functional groups along the polymer side chains have been manipulated from flowing liquids to gels and to rubber-like materials {{by the simple}} addition or subtraction of a neutral triatomic molecule, CO 2 or CS 2, at room temperature. The chemical changes, formation of <b>ammonium</b> <b>carbamates</b> and <b>ammonium</b> dithiocarbamates, create materials whose properties are totally {{different from those of}} the parent polymers as a result of the introduction of ionic cross-links. These materials can be returned to their original forms by heating (in the case of the CO 2 adducts) or to their protonated original forms by treatment with an acid (in the case of the CO 2 and CS 2 adducts). Heating the ammonium dithiocarbamates leads to loss of H 2 S and permanent (covalent) thiourea cross-links between the polymer chains. The new materials adhere strongly to other surfaces and can be swelled to several times their original volumes by different liquids. The rheological, swelling, and {{physical properties}} of the new materials have been correlated with the structures of the original polymers to provide a comprehensive picture of how changes at the nanometric length scale are translated to macroscopic changes. At least for the polysiloxanes examined here, the properties of the adducts do not correlate with the molecular weights of the original polymers, but do with the frequency of amino groups. The results demonstrate a simple, new method to cross-link polysiloxanes (and, in principle, a wide range of other polymers), transforming them into materials with totally different and potentially commercially useful properties...|$|R
40|$|Ordered {{mesoporous}} silicas (HMS, SBA-I 5 and MCF) were functionalized by aminoalkylsilylation via {{treatment with}} aminopropyltrialkoxysilane, ethyelendiaminepropyltrialkoxysilane and diethylenetriamine-propyltrialkoxysilane, and separately loaded with the amine polymers polyethyleneimine and polyallylamine via "wet impregnation" to prepare solid amine sorbents {{for the potential}} application to capture the post combustion flue gas CO 2 emitted by air fired fossil fuel power generators towards reducing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Silylations were initially mediated via traditional conventional stirred reactor and refluxing solvent techniques, then subsequently via the assistance of sonication and acid gases and via treatment with silane vapors towards improving the extent of aminoalklylsilylation and thereby the CO 2 capacity of the sorbent. Sonication and acid gas treatments were found to lead to higher capacity sorbents than the more traditional preparative techniques. The CO 2 capture potential of the sorbents was characterized via a custom modified thermogravimetric analyser combined differential thermoanalyser and a custom made "adiabatic" rig, {{the potential of the}} sorbents for CO 2 capture via vacuum swing adsorption process technology was in particular targeted, however the sorbents were also considered {{in the context of a}} potential temperature swing adsorption process. The sorbents were found to exhibit useful selective CO 2 sorption capacities which were achieved via the reversible chemisorption of CO 2 via reaction with the amine groups to form <b>ammonium</b> <b>carbamates.</b> The larger porosity OMS sorbents were found to lead to higher capacity sorbents on account of their ability to contain more of the active sorbent phase. Sorption at relatively higher process temperatures, as possible for flue gas, was preferred to achieve the kinetics required for VSA processing of the higher capacity sorbents on account of the temperature dependence of the diffusion of gases through the amine sorbent phase. The high process temperatures lead to decomposition of the sorbent by urea formation via carbamate dehydration, however the incorporation of water into the feed gases (such as is in combustion flue gases) was found to inhibit this process and so validate the potential of these types of materials for the proposed application. The sorbents were otherwise found to exhibit stability. Pelletized forms of the sorbents, such as it is thought would be required for industry application, were prepared via compression either in amine form, or in carbamate form for otherwise solid in liquid dispersions. Such pelletized sorbents were likewise found to exhibit viable, albeit reduced, CO 2 working capacities under the conditions tested. Solid amine sorbents prepared were thus found to be a promising potential option for the post combustion capture of CO 2 towards reducing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions...|$|R

However, the mechanisms responsible for these effects are still poorly understood. Thus, the aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether nicotine and cotinine, two major components of cigarette smoking, might induce a pro-thrombotic state via stimulation of tissue factor (TF) expression in endothelial (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Methods and Results: Incubation of ECs and SMCs with nicotine and cotinine induced tissue factor (TF) expression in both cell types in a dose-dependent fashion, exerting its effect at the transcriptional level, as demonstrated by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Nicotine and cotinine-induced TF expression was mediated by activation of the transcription factor, NF-kB, as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and by suppression of TF expression by the NF-kB inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithio <b>carbamate</b> <b>ammonium.</b> Conclusions: These data indicate that nicotine and cotinine exert direct effects on ECs and SMCs, shifting them toward a pro-thrombotic state via induction of TF expression.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{use of the}} {{volatile}} salt <b>ammonium</b> <b>carbamate</b> in protein downstream processing has recently been proposed. The main advantage of using volatile salts {{is that they can}} be removed from precipitates and liquid effluents through pressure reduction or temperature increase. Although previous studies showed that <b>ammonium</b> <b>carbamate</b> is efficient as a precipitant agent, there was evidence of denaturation in some enzymes. In this work, the effect of <b>ammonium</b> <b>carbamate</b> on the stability of five enzymes was evaluated. RESULTS: Activity assays showed that alpha-amylase (1, 4 -alpha-D-glucan glucanohydrolase, EC 3. 2. 1. 1), lysozyme (1, 4 -beta-N-acetylmuramoylhydrolase, EC 3. 2. 1. 17) and lipase (triacyl glycerol acyl hydrolase, EC 3. 1. 1. 3) did not undergo activity loss in <b>ammonium</b> <b>carbamate</b> solutions with concentrations from 1. 0 to 5. 0 mol kg(- 1), whereas cellulase complex (1, 4 -(1, 3 : 14) -beta-D-glucan 4 -glucano-hydrolase, EC 3. 2. 1. 4) and peroxidase (hydrogen peroxide oxidoreductase, EC 1. 11. 1. 7) showed an average activity loss of 55 % and 44 %, respectively. Precipitation assays did not show enzyme denaturation or phase separation for alpha-amylase and lipase, while celullase and peroxidase precipitated with some activity reduction. Analysis of similar experiments with ammonium and sodium sulfate did not affect the activity of enzymes. CONCLUSION: Celullase and peroxidase were denatured by <b>ammonium</b> <b>carbamate.</b> While more systematic studies are not available, care must be taken in designing a protein precipitation with this salt.

40|$|International audienceA new {{approach}} to get ordered and highly amine-functionalized organosilicas is described. The method consisted in using the reversible reaction between CO 2 and amines giving rise to <b>ammonium</b> <b>carbamate</b> salts. Four amine containing precursors were selected for this study: 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane 1, 11 -amino-undecyltrimethoxysilane 2, N-(2 -aminoethyl) - 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane 3 and N-(6 -aminohexyl) - 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane 4. CO 2 reacted with 1 and 2 giving rise to bis-silylated organosilica precursors containing <b>ammonium</b> <b>carbamate</b> salts in the core while reaction between CO 2 and 3 or 4 led to a supramolecular network of silylated <b>ammonium</b> <b>carbamate</b> salts.
