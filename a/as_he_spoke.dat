5|$|A {{backstage}} segment occurred where CM Punk {{was interviewed}} regarding his title {{defense in the}} Championship Scramble later in the evening. Randy Orton interrupted the interview, and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> with Punk, Cody Rhodes, Ted DiBiase, and Manu attacked Punk. Kofi Kingston tried to help Punk. After they had attacked both Punk and Kingston, Orton used his chance to perform a running punt on Punk.|$|E
5|$|When {{the crowd}} finally reached Versailles, it {{was met by}} another group that had {{assembled}} from the surrounding area. Members of the Assembly greeted the marchers and invited Maillard into their hall, where he fulminated about the Flanders Regiment and the people's need for bread. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke,</b> the restless Parisians came pouring into the Assembly and sank exhausted on the deputies' benches. Hungry, fatigued, and bedraggled from the rain, they seemed {{to confirm that the}} siege was a simple demand for food. The unprotected deputies {{had no choice but to}} receive the marchers, who shouted down most of the speakers and demanded to hear from the popular reformist deputy Mirabeau. The great orator declined this chance at demagoguery but nonetheless mingled familiarly with the market women, even sitting for some time with one of them upon his knee. A few other deputies welcomed the marchers warmly, including Maximilien Robespierre who was still at that time a relatively obscure figure in politics. Robespierre gave strong words of support to the women and their plight, and his efforts were received appreciatively; his solicitations helped greatly to soften the crowd's hostility towards the Assembly.|$|E

60|$|Sam had one, but it {{only made}} 'im more solemn, and he got in quite a temper <b>as</b> <b>'e</b> <b>spoke</b> about casuals loafing about on Tower Hill with their 'ands in their pockets, and taking gold lockets out of the mouths of {{hard-working}} sailormen.|$|R

25|$|For example, the {{nationalist}} Phan Boi Chau (1867–1940) wrote his History of the Loss of Vietnam (1905) and other tracts in Literary Chinese, and also {{used it to}} communicate when in Japan and China, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> neither Japanese nor Chinese.|$|E
25|$|Väinö Linna uses d as a {{hallmark}} of unpleasant command language in the novel The Unknown Soldier. Lieutenant Lammio was a native Helsinkian, and his language was considered haughty upper-class speech. On the other hand, private Asumaniemi's (another native Helsinkian) d raised no irritation, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> Helsinki slang as his everyday speech.|$|E
25|$|This {{language}} {{was at first}} adopted by the exiled Noldor after their return to Middle-earth at Losgar. Later Noldorin Sindarin changed, much due {{to the adoption of}} Quenya features, and partially due to the love of the Noldor for making linguistic changes. Beren's heritage was clear to Thingol of Doriath <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> the North Sindarin of his homeland.|$|E

25|$|Becoming a {{journalist}} after leaving {{politics in the}} eighties, Øgrim had a technology column in the Norwegian edition of PC World. He {{was known for his}} distinct writing style, where he rejected standard written Norwegian and, instead, wrote <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke,</b> in a working class dialect. He also wrote science fiction novels under the pseudonym Eirik Austey.|$|E
25|$|Returning from Iran, Ceauşescu {{ordered a}} mass rally in his support outside Communist Party {{headquarters}} in Bucharest on 21 December. However, to his shock, the crowd booed and jeered him <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke.</b> Years of repressed dissatisfaction boiled {{to the surface}} throughout the Romanian populace and even among elements in Ceauşescu's own government, and the demonstrations spread throughout the country.|$|E
25|$|Spurgeon was a {{prolific}} {{author of many}} types of works including sermons, an autobiography, commentaries, books on prayer, devotionals, magazines, poetry, hymns, and more. Many sermons were transcribed <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> and were translated into many languages during his lifetime. Spurgeon produced powerful sermons of penetrating thought and precise exposition. His oratory skills held his listeners spellbound in the Metropolitan Tabernacle and many Christians hold his writings in exceptionally high regard among devotional literature.|$|E

25|$|After {{talking with}} Cram and Rossi at Cram's home, Gacy had Cram drive {{him to a}} {{scheduled}} meeting with Leroy Stevens. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had earlier divulged to both himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders.

25|$|Rabbi Eliezer {{taught that}} one who cultivates land {{in which one}} can plant a quarter kav of seed is obligated to give a corner to the poor. Rabbi Joshua said land that yields two seah of grain. Rabbi Tarfon said land of at least six handbreadths by six handbreadths. Rabbi Judah ben Betera said land that {{requires}} two strokes of a sickle to harvest, and the law is <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke.</b> Rabbi Akiva said that one who cultivates land of any size is obligated to give a corner {{to the poor and}} the first fruits.|$|E
25|$|Before long, {{however, the}} president's humor {{on the subject}} ran out and, {{following}} the expulsion of two Catholic priests he believed to be behind his recent image problems, a 15 June 1955 declaration of the Sacred Consistorial Congregation (not of Pope Pius XII himself, who alone had authority to excommunicate a head of state) was interpreted as declaring Perón excommunicated. The following day, Péron called for a rally of support on the Plaza de Mayo, a time-honored custom among Argentine presidents during a challenge. However, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> before a crowd of thousands, Navy fighter jets flew overhead and dropped bombs into the crowded square below before seeking refuge in Uruguay.|$|E
6000|$|... "His {{father-in-law}} {{came up on}} deck <b>as</b> <b>'e</b> <b>spoke,</b> {{and began}} to brush 'imself all over with a clothesbrush.

25|$|Murphy briefly {{suspended}} the tour on 28 August 2014, after an egg was thrown at {{him by a}} member of the public in Kirkcaldy. Video evidence showed other members of the public wearing 'Yes' campaign insignias and berating Murphy <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke.</b> Murphy claimed that this was the result of an orchestrated attack by mobs of protesters organised by the Yes Scotland campaign in a deliberate attempt to intimidate him. The man responsible was a local resident who was a supporter of Scottish independence, who alleged that Jim Murphy had not answered a question asked of him. Pleading guilty to assault, he apologised for 'bringing the Yes campaign into disrepute unintentionally'.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, King founded an {{organization}} called Realizing the Dream, which has been absorbed into The King Center under King as president. CEO Dexter King had accused Martin of establishing the foundation to make money off their parents' legacy that {{should go to the}} King Center. On April 4, 2008, the fortieth anniversary of his father's death, King and Al Sharpton led a march around Memphis, Tennessee. There, he visited the Lorraine Hotel {{for the first time since}} his father's death, and placed a wreath where he stood before being shot. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> to those who participated in the march, King called for them to continue his father's fight and promoted Realizing the Dream, which he said sought to eliminate poverty.|$|E
25|$|When {{he arrived}} at Milan, Gullit {{initially}} struggled to settle <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> no Italian and was unused to living in a foreign country. Gullit's first season at Milan, however, saw the club win the Scudetto {{for the first time}} in nine years, under coach Arrigo Sacchi. He was initially used on the right of an attacking trio alongside Van Basten and Pietro Virdis, but after an injury to Van Basten it was changed to a front two. The following season Milan built on their domestic success by adding the European Cup to their list of honours. Their scintillating 5–0 demolition of Real Madrid in the semi-final second leg came at a cost, as Gullit suffered an injury and required surgery to be fit in time for the final. That performance was followed by a 4–0 victory over Steaua București in the 1989 final, with Gullit scoring two crucial goals. The following year, Milan retained the trophy as they defeated Benfica in the 1990 final. However, serious injuries sustained to the ligaments of his right knee limited Gullit's playing time and he managed just two domestic games in the 1989–90 season before appearing in the cup final.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> {{said this}} <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> to a vision, viewless to any eye but his own; then, folding his arms, {{which he had}} half extended, on his chest, he seemed to enclose in their embrace the {{invisible}} being.|$|R
500|$|Leonard Nimoy as Kashekim Nedakh, the King of Atlantis and Kida's father. Michael Cedeno, supervising {{animator}} for King Nedakh, {{was astounded}} at Nimoy's voice talent, stating {{that he had}} [...] "so much rich character" [...] in his performance. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> his lines, Cadeno said the crew would sit there and watch Nimoy in astonishment.|$|E
500|$|<b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> {{his final}} sentence, {{he brought his}} hands to his head, fingers {{extended}} in imitation of thorns; amid dead silence in the Coliseum, he extended his arms, recalling with words and posture the Crucifixion of Jesus, and held that position for several seconds. [...] He then lowered his arms, and began the journey back to his seat in the silence.|$|E
500|$|On 3 November, Macdonald {{rose in the}} Commons {{to defend}} the government, and {{according}} to his biographer P.B.

60|$|Gloom indeed {{hung over}} him. For, when one heard him talk of listed stocks and {{cumulative}} dividends, there was as deep a tone in his quiet voice <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> of eternal punishment and {{the wages of}} sin.|$|R
