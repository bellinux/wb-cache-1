40|$|Problem Statement: A rapidly {{increasing}} interest {{has been observed}} in finding alternatives to traditional forms of assessment in education. For at least three decades, teachers, curriculum developers and program administrators have been studying hard to identify appropriate procedures to assess the knowledge and abilities of students. The term “authentic assessment” has emerged from this need {{in the field of}} education, and can be described as “the multiple forms of <b>assessment</b> that <b>reflect</b> <b>student</b> <b>learning,</b> achievement, motivation, and attitudes on instructionally-relevant classroom activities” (O’Malley and Valdez Pierce, 1996, p. 4). Given that the topic is a relatively new and challenging one, it has been observed that to examine language teachers’ perceptions and attitude toward authentic assessment is quite important. Purpose of Study: In this study, a questionnaire which aims to determine the ideas and opinions of English language instructors regarding the use of authentic assessment has been applied and {{the results of the study}} have been presented and discussed. Method: In order to find answers to the research question “What are the language teaching instructors’ ideas and attitude toward authentic assessment in language teaching classes?”, a questionnaire which is called “Authentic Assessment Inventory for Goal Setting”(O’Malley and Valdez; 1992) has been used in this study. This inventory has been applied to 37 randomly-selected instructors from Atilim University Preparatory School of English. Theinventory consists of 15 questions that can be answered with three alternatives, mainly, 1 =not at all, 2 = somewhat, 3 = a great deal. Findings: Answers to the questions in the inventory where handled under two maincategories: at what point the instructors are now, and where they wish to be concerning the issue of authentic assessment. Conclusion and Recommendations: As a concluding remark for the study, it will bepedagogically useful to attach more importance to authentic assessment in curriculum andeducational programs of language teaching. Additionally, it is recommended that morescientific research be conducted about authentic assessment, in particular on goal-setting,educational planning and program development...|$|R

40|$|The Myron B. Thompson School of Social Work (SW) PhD {{program at}} the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa {{currently}} has 16 students and 10 graduate faculty members. Developing and implementing sustainable PhD assessment plans are necessary to <b>reflect</b> <b>student</b> <b>learning</b> and curriculum improvements. Articulating the PhD program rubrics into a program-level assessment plan is imperative. The SW PhD program has developed seven <b>Student</b> <b>Learning</b> Outcomes (SLOs), assessable outcomes, and a curriculum map. In Fall of 2015, the PhD program committee revisited the SLOs and made revisions in alignment with the sustainable assessment plan for the program as a foundational step for creating program rubrics. The committee developed program rubrics for benchmarks—(a) specialization, (b) comprehensive examination (i. e., dissertation proposal), and (c) final exam (i. e., dissertation defense) —that {{are tied to the}} SLOs. The committee began collecting data using developed rubrics in Spring 2016 as a pilot to gain additional clarity on the rubrics in order to make them efficient and manageable as key parts of PhD program curriculum.

The {{goal of this}} study was to determine the impact of a discussion group program on the development of conceptual reasoning skills of students enrolled in a large lecture-format introductory biology course. In the discussion group, students worked on problems based on topics discussed in lecture. The program was evaluated using three assessment tools. First, student responses to pre- and posttests were analyzed. The test question asked the students to demonstrate the relationships between 10 different but related terms. Use of a concept map to link the terms indicated an advanced level of conceptual reasoning skills. There was a 13. 8 % increase in the use of concept maps from pre- to posttest. Second, the students took a Likert-type survey to determine the perceived impact of the program on their conceptual reasoning skills. Many of the students felt that the program helped them understand and use the main course concepts to logically solve problems. Finally, average exam grades increased as the semester progressed. The average final grade in the course was 75 %. Students enrolled in the course the previous year (where the lecture component of the course did not assess or <b>reflect</b> <b>student</b> <b>learning</b> in the discussion group) had an average final grade of 69 %.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} analysing teacher growth {{in the context of}} science education. It focuses on the identification of pathways in the development of secondary school teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) by the use of the interconnected model of teachers’ professional growth (IMTPG). The teachers (n =  12) participated in a one-year action research project focused on their individual concerns related to teaching science. The use of the IMTPG revealed that teachers use different pathways of learning to develop different aspects of their PCK. For each PCK component, three distinct pathways could be identified, two of which clearly were associated with professional growth. When examining these two pathways in detail, it was found that (1) teachers learned about new instructional strategies and assessment methods mostly through literature reviews and discussions with peers and (2) teachers who analyzed and <b>reflected</b> on <b>student</b> <b>learning</b> as it happened in their classrooms developed understandings that helped them to select and apply instructional strategies to further promote <b>student</b> <b>learning.</b> Both the analytical method as well as the identification of the different developmental pathways help to better understand teacher development in the context of classroom practices...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—One of the {{limiting}} aspects in education {{research is the}} techniques available for determining if a <b>student</b> has <b>learned</b> something. In this work, {{the goal is to}} extend our exploration of how mind maps can be automatically analyzed using their graph properties to <b>reflect</b> <b>student</b> <b>learning.</b> In particular, a set of student mind maps are created three times during a class in both 2011 and 2012 on digital system design using a common technical vocabulary. These mind maps are analyzed by extracting graph metrics by comparison with a criterion mind map, which is an expert created mind map. The metrics are derived from traditional graph metrics (average degree and graph density), three sets of difference metrics analyzed with a internally created tool, and a graph metric invented for comparing proteins. The results of this exploratory analysis is that five of the six metrics can be used to evaluate if a <b>student</b> is <b>learning</b> and connecting the vocabulary in a given subject over time. Additionally, these five metrics are correlated to one another. This result is promising, but we emphasize that these metrics do not correlate directly to class performance based on student grades over the course, and therefore, the current goal for this measurement technique is to be used to provide the student with automated feedback on their mind maps as related to the technical vocabulary of a course. This work extends our original work by increasing the number of graph metrics that are used to automatically analyze student maps to a criterion map. The idea is to find a number of graph metrics that can then be combined to help analyze a students mind map and provide them with useful feedback. Even though our results show that compare 5 metrics and each metric can be used to observe student improvement, each of these metrics differs in how the metric can be interpreted and related to the process of learning. Therefore, our goal is to find a number of these metrics {{so that they can be}} combined to provide the student with a variety of feedback results to help them understand their errors in terms of the structure of their mind map.

The researcher also kept a journal for reflection after each lesson in order to better understand and <b>reflect</b> on <b>student</b> <b>learning.</b> Data collected from the videotape transcripts <b>reflected</b> that <b>students</b> made mistakes that fell into six categories: (1) holding a note or rest too long, (2) playing a note or rest too short, (3) wrong syllable used, (4) unsteady pulse, (5) stops and hesitations due to rushing, and (6) incorrect rhythm. Analysis of this data resulted in identifying specific problems arising from the two rhythm methods used. Results showed that there were no apparent differences in achievement between the two approaches to <b>learning</b> rhythm. The <b>students,</b> regardless of method, generally made the same types of errors when counting and playing rhythms; they made fewer errors when they counted a rhythm before playing it rather than playing it first. The limitations of the study and suggestions for further studies are given...|$|R
5000|$|Student-centered {{learning}} environments {{have been shown}} to be effective in higher education. They have been defined specifically within higher education as both a mindset and a culture within a given educational institution and as a learning approach broadly related to, and supported by, constructivist theories of learning. They are characterised by innovative methods of teaching which aim to promote learning in communication with teachers and other learners and which take students seriously as active participants in their own learning and foster transferable skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and reflective thinking. The revised European Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance, due to be approved by the ministers of European higher education in May 2015, include the following passage on student-centred learning: [...] "Institutions should ensure that programmes are delivered in a way that encourages students to take an active role in creating the learning process and ensure that the <b>assessment</b> of <b>students</b> <b>reflects</b> this approach." ...|$|R
40|$|Constraint-based {{modeling}} tools, as well {{as computer}} graphics tools in general, offer the user many choices in commands and techniques for creating graphics, which forces the user to have a strategy or plan as they proceed. The formulation of this plan is often dependent on the integration of existing knowledge and current factors, such as customer specifications and the time element assigned to the particular project. In addition, the user must have {{a thorough understanding of}} the software functional-ity and the ability to gather information related to implementing a particular modeling strategy. This process of strategy development and implementation coincides with components of learning theory. As engineering graphics educators, it is helpful to <b>reflect</b> on how <b>students</b> <b>learn</b> in our classrooms and labo-ratories {{as well as}} reflect on how we develop instruction. This paper outlines three theories of learning that are applicable to graphics education, discusses the assumptions about the learner and the learning environment, presents the components of learning for each theory, discusses major issues related to complex learning and designing instruction, and summarizes some of the criticisms and contributions to education of each theory. Indeed, a process is presented for applying elements of these learning theories to constraint-based modeling...|$|R
30|$|Interpretation {{and link}} to theory In {{accordance}} with our research question, we concentrated most {{on the effects}} of the three basic dimensions of instructional quality: Klieme et al. (2006) assume that cognitive activation <b>reflects</b> elaborative <b>student</b> <b>learning</b> and thus leads to higher achievements. Bivariate analysis confirms this hypothesis with regard to the two cognitive activation dimensions “understanding” and “task analysis”: challenging learning tasks and reflecting about learning tasks before working them out indeed predict student competence (development) in accounting. However, the opposite is true for cognitive activation in the sense of adapting teachers’ expectations and the difficulty of questions to the students’ abilities. To avoid redundancies, reasons for this negative association at the class level are reported in the section “multivariate linear growth curve models”. The second basic dimension—classroom management—is assumed to lead to an increase in learning time, which should in turn be positively associated with achievement. The positive effect of time spent on learning was not confirmed. Again, the interpretation follows in the next section. Supportive climate, the third basic dimension, is assumed to lead to higher intrinsic motivation, which in turn predicts student academic achievement. Although we did not test for the mediation effect, the assumption that the four dimensions of a supportive climate (competence, autonomy, relatedness, structure) positively predict student competence in accounting was confirmed at levels 1 and 2 with two exceptions: both competence and autonomy support showed a negative effect at level 3  and competence support allone at level 2. We interpret this contradiction as follows: when teachers try to improve low-performing students and provide them with feelings of success and autonomy, it may slow down the average class progress and/or instructions might not be sufficiently challenging.|$|R
