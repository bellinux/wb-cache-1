5|$|The {{airfield}} {{served as}} an <b>alternative</b> <b>destination</b> for Imperial Airways when Croydon was fogbound. The runway was {{just long enough for}} this purpose. Using Penshurst as an alternate destination caused delays to the passengers as there were no Customs facilities. On 18 February 1932, both Croydon and Penshurst were fogbound, and Handley Page H.P.45 G-AAXE Hengist diverted to Heston Aerodrome. As Customs facilities existed there, passengers were on their way in 10 minutes, as opposed to the three hour or longer delay when using Penshurst. The practice of having a Customs Officer attend Penshurst on a daily basis was instigated, but it was discontinued in February 1935. On 24 October 1932, a German and a French airliner diverted to Penshurst due to smog over London.|$|E

40|$|The European {{crisis has}} {{diverted}} migration flows away from countries {{affected by the}} recession towards Germany. The diversion process creates a challenge for traditional discrete-choice models that assume that only bilateral factors account for dyadic migration rates. This paper shows how {{taking into account the}} sequential nature of migration decisions leads to write the bilateral migration rate as a function of expectations about the evolution of economic conditions in <b>alternative</b> <b>destinations.</b> Empirically, we incorporate 10 -year bond yields as an explanatory variable capturing forward-looking expectations and apply our model to an empirical analysis of migration from the countries of the European Economic Association to Germany in the period 2006 - 2012. We show that disregarding <b>alternative</b> <b>destinations</b> leads to substantial biases in the estimation of the determinants of migration rates...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we review {{attempts}} to develop CPM of individual travel behavior. CPM represent a linked set of computer programs together with appropriate databases which {{are designed to}} {{capture the essence of}} human decision making in different spatial situations. Used primarily for wayfinding and to simulate and predict travel behavior, CPMs bypass the difficult problems of IIA typically attributed to discrete choice models. They also allow greater emphasis on the cognitive components of decision making including cognitive maps, preferences, and departure from utility maximizing and linearity in the considerations of alternative paths and <b>alternative</b> <b>destinations.</b> The CPM illustrated herein focuses on multiperson households and models travel behavior before and after telecommuting takes place in the household° Sets of feasible <b>alternative</b> <b>destinations</b> for travel purposes are derived using GIS procedures such as buffering and path selection.

For example, migration streams are larger to destinations where the public share of forestland and the road system are larger. These features also characterize regions of more rapid deforestation. Therefore, emigration policies must recognize their effects on deforestation at the frontier-and their anticipated indirect effects on downstream environments. ...|$|R

However, the market has become more and more lucrative with the arrival of more venues and more nights, and Vauxhall has been criticised as becoming increasingly commercial, diluting its once underground appeal. But the demise of other club venues in London, such as Turnmills, the Astoria and The Fridge, have led to the gay club scene to become more centralised in Vauxhall, turning it into an <b>alternative</b> <b>destination</b> from Soho for gay people to socialise. Vauxhall has also become colloquially known as [...] "Voho" [...] (a portmanteau of the names Vauxhall and Soho) within the gay community, due to the emergence of Vauxhall as a gay village after Soho.|$|E
