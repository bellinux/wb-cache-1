500|$|To {{one side}} of the Gardens is the bizarre grotto {{designed}} by Bernardo Buontalenti. The lower fa√ßade was begun by Vasari [...] but the architecture of the upper storey is subverted by [...] "dripping" [...] pumice stalactites with the Medici coat of arms at the centre. The interior is similarly poised between architecture and nature; the first chamber has copies of Michelangelo's four unfinished slaves emerging from the corners which seem to carry the vault with an open oculus at its centre and painted as a rustic bower with animals, figures and vegetation. Figures, animals and trees made of stucco and rough pumice adorn the lower walls. A short passage leads to a small second chamber and to a third which has a central fountain with Giambologna's Venus in the centre of the basin, peering fearfully over her shoulder at the four satyrs spitting jets of water <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> edge.|$|E
500|$|Ivy {{appeared}} {{several times}} in GameDaily's [...] "Babe of the Week" [...] series of articles, including as a stand-alone article and at eleventh place in their [...] "Top 50 Hottest Game Babes" [...] article. They later named her amongst other female characters in the Soul series {{as an example of}} a strong and iconic female character in video gaming. The New York Times felt her appearance came from the same [...] "Goth cyberaesthetic [...] that gave us The Matrix", one they felt was already becoming outdated. UGO.com ranked her eighteenth in their [...] "Top 50 Videogame Hotties" [...] article, stating [...] "However much she instills fear in our hearts, we revel in the opportunity to stare <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> safety of our television sets." [...] In later articles, they named her one of the top eleven girls of gaming at number ten and one of the top eleven video game heroines at number eight, stating [...] "What can you say about a chick that carries a whip? If you're talking about Ivy from the Soul Calibur series, you could say she's pretty intimidating." ...|$|E
60|$|Motionless, {{the two men}} stare <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{other side}} of the room, amazed.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: She is so {{beautiful}} Holly can only bear to look <b>at</b> <b>her</b> veiled, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Graphic (1886) ...|$|R
60|$|He shot {{a glance}} of {{suspicion}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> under <b>the</b> black thatch of brows that met above {{his nose and}} were as one brow.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Did {{you say it}} in that tone? You {{should have}} thrown {{yourself}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> feet! <b>From</b> <b>the</b> moment you didn't--surely you understand women well enough to know.' ...|$|R
60|$|As the {{old woman}} came on a snowball was thrown <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{other side of the}} street.|$|E
60|$|He {{glanced up}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground, almost as darkly {{as he had}} looked at Tom Pinch; but held his peace.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked down}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{steps of the}} moving train. There was {{something}} in his expression {{that she had never}} seen there before.|$|E
60|$|The only {{feminine}} consciousness she retained {{was that}} she was more relieved <b>at</b> <b>her</b> deliverance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wild cattle and unbroken horses of <b>her</b> progress than <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Indians and soldiers.|$|R
6000|$|Effie {{shut her}} book over her hand. [...] "It keeps me wakeful longer," [...] she whispered, {{with a glance}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> mother <b>from</b> <b>the</b> corner of <b>her</b> eye.|$|R
60|$|That cruel monster Finality grinned <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> across <b>the</b> room. Love {{was lying}} {{bleeding}} and fettered {{at the feet}} of some intangible, superhuman spectre which Dea Flavia dreaded because it was the Unknown.|$|R
60|$|The {{interview}} {{lasted about}} half an hour. Then he somewhat abruptly handed her over the stile and stood looking <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other side.|$|E
60|$|She stood {{beneath the}} {{withered}} trees, beside the shattered fountain. The sad-faced ghosts peeped out <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> broken {{windows of the}} little silent houses.|$|E
60|$|She {{hurried into}} Kennicott's room, {{sat on the}} edge of his bed. He flapped a drowsy {{welcoming}} hand <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> expanse of quilt and dented pillows.|$|E
60|$|The Bonita {{was already}} out of the little harbor, bowing and courtesying on the ocean swell to <b>the</b> wind <b>from</b> <b>the</b> south which filled all her sails, and gliding through the water as if rejoicing <b>at</b> <b>her</b> escape <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shoal.|$|R
60|$|As she spoke, Miss Plenty looked up, almost apprehensively, {{at one of}} the wooden-faced old portraits {{with which}} her room was hung, as if asking pardon of the severe-nosed matron who stared back <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> under <b>the</b> sort of blue dish cover which formed her headgear.|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> out of <b>the</b> dusky hollows of his brow, {{and did not}} answer. The faint, stupid half-smile, half-sneer was on his lips.|$|R
60|$|Alice turned swiftly. Her {{mother was}} {{standing}} at a little distance, with all the calm and moveless concentration of a waxwork figure, looking up <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> staircase.|$|E
6000|$|... "Whist, mother," [...] said John, {{looking back}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tail of his eye, [...] "I go to France as an archer to give blows {{and to take}} them." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her white-clothed form at this dim-lit cease of day [...] Made {{her look}} as one crucified In my gaze <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{midst of the}} dusty way, [...] And hurriedly [...] "Don't," [...] I cried.|$|E
50|$|Patrice Oppliger gained <b>her</b> degree <b>from</b> <b>the</b> University of Nebraska <b>at</b> Kearney, <b>her</b> masters <b>from</b> <b>the</b> University of Maine, and her {{doctorate}} University of Alabama.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bentley {{had just}} {{driven into the}} yard with the new summer boarder. Mrs. Bentley and Agnes were peeping <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> behind <b>the</b> parlour {{curtains}} with the keen interest that they--shut in by their restricted farm life--always felt in any visitor <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outside world lying beyond their boundary of purple misted hills.|$|R
60|$|And {{stealing}} close, {{she bent}} {{and slipped it}} in. Two faces looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> round <b>the</b> door; she heard Bob Pillin's smothered chuckle; her mother's rich and feathery laugh. Oh! How red his forehead was! She touched it with her lips; skipped back, twirled round, danced silently a second, blew a kiss, and like quicksilver was gone.|$|R
60|$|HIGGINS [coming grimly <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> divan, and {{accompanying}} {{her to the}} door] Good-bye. Be sure you try on that small talk at the three at-homes. Don't be nervous about it. Pitch it in strong.|$|E
60|$|The {{room was}} {{suddenly}} flooded with light. Philip, rigid and ghastly, was looking <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{other side of}} the table. She held up her hands as though to shut out the sight of him.|$|E
60|$|She said nothing. I {{looked back}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> door. Her {{eyes were fixed}} upon me, a little distended, full of mute questioning. I only shook my head. So I left her and passed out into the night.|$|E
60|$|Colter {{and the men}} {{waited on}} her solicitously, and in silence, now and then {{stealing}} furtive glances <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> under <b>the</b> shadow of their black sombreros. The dark night settled down like a blanket. There were no stars. The wind moaned fitfully among the pines, and all about that lonely, hidden recess was in harmony with Ellen's thoughts.|$|R
60|$|For {{he loved}} her to-night; he would watch over and protect her. He would save <b>her</b> <b>at</b> least <b>from</b> <b>the</b> deadliest of insults.|$|R
50|$|<b>At</b> <b>her</b> {{retirement}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Faculty of Music, UCT, she {{was made}} emeritus associate professor. She continued on {{as a part-time}} vocal teacher at UCT {{until the end of}} 1994. She retired from singing in 1978, returning once to the stage of the Nico Malan theatre in 1982 to sing Mamita in Gigi.|$|R
60|$|The {{next moment}} her eyes met Fra Luca's {{as they looked}} up <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crucifix, and she was absorbed in that pang of {{recognition}} which identified this monkish emaciated form {{with the image of}} her fair young brother.|$|E
60|$|The {{boys were}} not {{satisfied}} with gazing <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pier, but clambered on board, and a view of her interior arrangements only served to strengthen the good opinion formed by a single glance at the graceful lines of the hull.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know. Of course." [...] Quick sympathy {{came into}} Sally's voice. She gave a sidelong glance of {{approval}} and gratitude {{at the large}} picture of Lew Lucas which beamed up <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> morning paper. [...] "You poor thing! How are you?" ...|$|E
50|$|<b>At</b> <b>her</b> return <b>from</b> <b>the</b> US, she {{compiled}} her {{articles in}} a book, a travel journal, published in 1896 by Calmann-Levy. She visited the US again in 1897 for a shorter amount of time. Her travel journal was a best-seller and was edited again 8 times, in different editions, {{the latest in}} 1904.|$|R
50|$|Russell-Brown {{received}} <b>her</b> B.A. <b>from</b> <b>the</b> University of California <b>at</b> Berkeley, <b>her</b> J.D. <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Hastings College of Law and <b>her</b> Ph.D. <b>from</b> <b>the</b> criminology {{department of}} the University of Maryland, College Park.|$|R
