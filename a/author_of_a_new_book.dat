60|$|Although, however, {{a writer}} of marked quality may do well to let his genius develop its {{spontaneous}} forces without too assiduous or vigilant repression, trusting to other writers of equal strength in other directions, and to the general fitness of things and operation of time, to redress the balance, still it is the task of criticism in counting up the contributions {{of one of these}} strong men to examine the mischiefs no less than the benefits incident to their work. There is no puny carping nor cavilling in the process. It is because such men are strong that they are able to do harm; they may injure the taste and judgment of a whole generation, just because they are never mediocre. That is implied in strength. Macaulay is not to be measured now merely {{as if he were the}} <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book.</b> His influence has been a distinct literary force, and in an age of reading, this is to be a distinct force in deciding the temper, the process, the breadth, of men's opinions, no less than the manner of expressing them. It is no new observation that the influence of an author becomes in time something apart from his books: a certain generalised or abstract personality impresses itself on our minds, long after we have forgotten the details of his opinions, the arguments by which he enforced them, and even, what are usually the last to escape us, the images by which he illustrated them. Phrases and sentences are a mask: but we detect the features of the man behind the mask. This personality of a favourite author is a real and powerful agency. Unconsciously we are infected with his humours; we apply his methods; we find ourselves copying the rhythm and measure of his periods; we wonder how he would have acted, or thought, or spoken in our circumstances. Usually a strong writer leaves a special mark in some particular region of mental activity: the final product of him is to fix some persistent religious mood, or some decisive intellectual bias, or else some trick of the tongue. Now Macaulay has contributed no philosophic ideas to the speculative stock, nor has he developed any one great historic or social truth. His work is always full of a high spirit of manliness, probity, and honour; but he is not of that small band to whom we may apply Mackintosh's thrice and four times enviable panegyric on the eloquence of Dugald Stewart, that its peculiar glory consisted in having 'breathed the love of virtue into whole generations of pupils.' He has painted many striking pictures, and imparted a certain reality to our conception of many great scenes of the past. He did good service in banishing once for all those sentimental Jacobite leanings and prejudices which had been kept alive by the sophistry of the most popular of historians, and the imagination of the most popular of romance writers. But where he set his stamp has been upon style; style in its widest sense, not merely on the grammar and mechanism of writing, but on what De Quincey described as its organology; style, that is to say, in its relation to ideas and feelings, its commerce with thought, and its reaction on what one may call the temper or conscience of the intellect.|$|E

If you had little money, but wanted minimal {{breakdowns}} with the vehicle that you drove to work every day, you bought a Toyota. Thanks to the introduction of the automaker's Lexus line in the 1990 s, that image has now changed. The Lexus brand is now synonymous with the world of luxury, even though car enthusiasts and purists would argue that Lexus is more of a middle-market luxury car line. However, Lexus sales surpassed Mercedes Benz and Cadillac sales-the two granddaddies of luxury cars-in the United States quite easily, thanks to Toyota's brilliant and methodical marketing strategy. The firm's philosophy of conducting meticulous research over much time and money has been widely admired and studied by other automakers and college students alike and has cemented Toyota's position {{as one of the most}} successful carmakers in the world.

40|$|In recent years, {{articles}} have appeared {{from time to}} time in the Western press that deal with cases of plagiarism in China and speculated on what these incidents may reveal about how academic life and the educational system in the PRC work. When we learned that anthropologist Susan Blum, one of the contributors toChina Beyond the Headlines, a book that was co-edited by a contributor to China Beat (Timothy Weston) and in a sense was trying to do in print form some of the things that this blog now tries to do online, has been combining writing about various aspects of Chinese culture with writing about plagiarism in the U. S. (and elsewhere), we thought it would be great to get her to reflect for us on what is and is not unusual about the situation in the PRC. Here’s what Blum, the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> called My Word!: Plagiarism and College Culture as well as an earlier work on deception and truth in China, Lies that Bind: Chinese Truth, Other Truths (Rowman and Littlefield, 2007), had to say in response our invitation: Plagiarism. Doesn’t the very word send chills down your spine? It resemblesplague, after all (even though it has no genetic connection to it), and a plague must sicken us all. So the cases of plagiarism and academic misconduct, fraud, copying, and misrepresentation that are the latest ills to beset China make for great journalistic stories. China should, by some accounts, take its lead from the “West,” and especially from the United States. In case you haven’t noticed, the United States too is consumed by worries about plagiarism and violations of academic integrity. But we have the sense that things are worse in China. The whole topic of plagiarism depends on related ideas of originality. By a certain logic, developed in Western Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, an author should write original works (Woodmansee 1984, Rose 1993), and should be paid—in both money and “credit”—for that contribution, especially because the best authors were seen as geniuses, inspired by their Muse or by God. The unique work of each of these geniuses should be acknowledged. And paid...|$|E

40|$|Indonesia’s {{struggle}} is also our challenge, argues Greg Barton, <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> on Jemaah Islamiyah THE car bomb exploding {{at the gates}} of our embassy in Jakarta last week was shocking but it was not surprising. With key leaders and master bomb makers like Dr Azahari Husein and Noordin Mohamad Top at large {{it was only a matter}} of time before Jemaah Islamiyah, the jihadi Islamist terrorist group almost certainly behind last Thursday’s blast, struck again. But this makes it no less a tragedy for the primary victims of attack, the ten Indonesians who died and the 180 or so who were horribly injured, or any less confronting for all of us. It challenges us with the inevitable question: are we doing enough to stop this? A simple ‘yes’ is never going to suffice with a matter like this. So let’s review our progress. Although we tend to overlook it, there is a lot of good news here. Every bombing forces us to ask why were not able to prevent it happening but by definition we seldom hear of successful interventions. Imagine for a moment what might have been. What would have happened if Indonesian police had not established the link between Bali bomber Amrozi and the twisted remnants of his murderous minivan? What we do know is that the remarkable success of the Bali bombing investigation led to the arrest of more than 300 JI operatives and the significant crippling of a formidable international terrorist network that we scarcely knew anything about prior to the attack in Bali on 12 October 2002. This success undoubtedly saved many lives, perhaps hundreds, by stopping JI from carrying out further attacks that it had been planning. The suicide bombing of the Marriott Hotel in August last year and this new attack are reminders that JI remains a dangerous force. It also reminds us that JI is in the business of rebuilding. Almost everyone in Indonesian is just as appalled by JI’s terrorist activities as we are in Australia. Nevertheless a very small number of young people in Indonesia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia are vulnerable to being persuaded by JI that the manifold evils and injustices of this frequently sad little planet all have a common origin and a simple cure. JI has made good use of film-makers as well as bomb-makers. It has produced powerful propaganda films about communal violence in Maluku, spliced with moving images about the sufferings of Muslims around the world, to reach out to the angry and the naive and recruit them to its cause. It understands what it takes to turn youthful zealotary into murderous idealism. The good news is that cooperation between the Australian Federal Police and the Indonesian police since the Bali bombing has greatly weakened JI and led to Australia making substantial investments in the region, such as the counter-terrorism center located alongside the national police academy in Semarang, Central Java. Hundreds of millions of dollars of fresh counter-terrorism investments have been made in Australian government agencies meaning that we are better prepared than ever before to struggle against terrorism in our region. The not so good news is that we are yet to make the strategic investments that we need to in building our human capacity to understand and work within our region. A billion of dollars of satellite surveillance and signals monitoring hardware is of very little use without the human expertise to translate and interpret the flood of raw data pulled out of the air every hour. Making sense of the patterns in this data requires a different kind of expertise again. We need to replace and increase the level of knowledge of Asian societies and Muslim communities in our universities and research institutions if we are to begin have the capacity we need to make sense of our challenging environment. We need to be producing many more Asia-literate university graduates than we are now if we are to be able to truly understand our part of the world and develop durable and effective partnerships across the region. Moreover, we urgently need to understand the sociological and psychological dynamics within JI and the radical Islamist fringe if we are to effectively respond to its potential to rebuild and evolve. Fortunately, when the bombs went off in Bali two years ago AFP commissioner Mick Keelty already had good working relationship with senior Indonesian police officers such as I Made Mangku Pastika, who was appointed to head up the post-bombing investigation. Fortunately, Graham Ashton, whom Keelty called soon after the bombing to head up the AFP investigation team, is fluent in Indonesian and has an expert understanding of Southeast Asian cultural subtleties. Were this not the case the outcome could easily have been very much less good. With only three per cent of our university students studying an Asian language and only five per cent studying an aspect of Asia at all we need to be doing a great deal more if we want to be sure of continued good news in what will certainly be a very long struggle against terrorism in our region. Labor’s pledge to invest $ 64 million in the teaching Asian languages is a good start. A substantial counter-offer from the coalition would signal that we are finally waking up to the full range of the challenges facing us.

His book, Indonesia’s Struggle: Jemaah Islamiyah and the Soul of Islam was published by UNSW Press in association with APO this month. This article first appeared in the Courier-Mail...|$|E
40|$|What {{does the}} "creative economy" mean in China and how might it be developed, asks MICHAEL KEANE VIEWERS of the Beijing Olympic Games opening {{ceremony}} {{on the evening}} of 8 August 2008 witnessed the most impressively coordinated launch of any major global event. Superbly choreographed by the film director Zhang Yimou, the spectacle was filled with colour, symbolic meaning and historical references. While the synchronised presentation of the 2008 Confucian drummers might have reinforced a stereotype of socialist compliance for many, the digitised scroll on which China 2 ̆ 7 s historical achievements were performed was sublimely imaginative. Contrary to most international perceptions of China 2 ̆ 7 s staged propaganda events, this installation was not the outcome of a cultural committee, but a concept created by a local digital media company called Crystal Stone. Founded in 1995 by three people working in architectural design imaging, Crystal Stone now employs 2200. Crystal Stone operated ten digital video displays at the Olympics, in the process establishing its own Olympic record in the category of longest duration of display, the biggest video screen, and the largest quantity of data with the most 3 D and digital special effects. In identifying the importance of creative skills in digital content applications, Crystal Stone has been able to use 3 D imaging to broaden their market base. The company 2 ̆ 7 s success on the largest international stage possible has in turn stimulated {{the development of a new}} industry ecosystem. The use of 3 -D digital imaging technology in the Beijing Olympics has led to innovation in Chinese media industries. For instance, 3 -D digital technology is now familiar in many epic history documentaries produced for China Central Television. Building on its technological assets and its human capital, Crystal Stone has moved into video animation production through a joint capital investment with the computer giant Lenovo. Creativity is not just about the individual Journalistic accounts of China 2 ̆ 7 s urban transformations often follow a standard script. A writer living in a Chinese city conducts a vox pop, encounters a few bohemian artists and chances on urban youth culture. The author shares common experiences of international consumer tastes, and presents an account of the new Chinese individualism. These descriptions, however, usually miss the bigger picture. Chinese cities have always been places of diversity, although this is not so apparent to the eyes of foreigners accustomed to recognising stereotypes. According to Chen Guanzhong, the author of Bohemian China (2004), Beijing 2 ̆ 7 s complex non-conformity dates back hundreds of years. Its geographical closeness to Mongolia and the former Manchuria (the region now collectively termed Dongbei) has resulted in a hybrid sensibility. However, in recent years, it is becoming clear that signs of tolerance have extended. Chen says: "whether you have long hair or a shaved head, whether you wear well-fitting clothes or clothes whose style and colour don 2 ̆ 7 t match, in public Beijing people are indifferent. " He also adds, "Beijing is ‘cool 2 ̆ 7, like New York: you can praise or deride Beijingers. They just don 2 ̆ 7 t care. " In the years leading up to the Beijing Games, China experienced the beginnings of a creative renaissance. Thousands of cultural and creative parks, zones, precincts corridors and bases were commissioned, giving a material face to what China 2 ̆ 7 s leaders now term "cultural soft power" and "cultural creative industries. " The Beijing Games allowed the construction of a number of iconic design spectacles: the Bird 2 ̆ 7 s Nest Olympic Stadium, the Water Cube swimming complex, and the new China Central TV towers (now close to completion). Beijing had its Games in 2008. Now Shanghai is looking with anticipation to the 2010 World Expo. The point to note, however, is that city governments all over China are now realising the value of the creative economy. The view from the margins The architectural "curator" of the Bird 2 ̆ 7 s Nest Stadium, Ai Weiwei, is an entrepreneur with the kind of creative latitude that international designers can only dream about. Ai Weiwei has been able to exploit his success by openly voicing opinions about China 2 ̆ 7 s need to move towards a more creative society. Ai 2 ̆ 7 s most recent "urban installation," the ORDOS 100 Project in Inner Mongolia, has raised the bar. In early 2008, 100 international architects from 27 different countries were invited to the desert city of Ordos, eighty minutes flying time west of Beijing, to each design a 1000 square metre villa. The Ordos Cultural Creative Industry Park, the epicentre of this project, is already a test bed for creative experimentation in China. Bert de Muynck, a Beijing-based writer who has followed this development, says the use of the term "unprecedented" is often a blind and uncritical epithet for a country in the throes of change. He believes the ORDOS 100 project is beginning to suggest that unprecedented is almost meaningless. The project is bankrolled by Chinese millionaire Cai Jiang who provides the resources from two of his companies, Jiangyuan Cultural and Creative Industrial Development Ltd and Jiang Yuan Water Engineering Ltd. According to de Muynck, Cai says: "We give the architects the freedom to design whatever they want, so they can put all their ideas into their work. If there happens to be a difference between the designs and the Chinese regulations, we will do something to make the balance and try our best to make it better. " It is ironic that an artist can be more creative in China than in the West. Of course, there are well known limits to the subject matter. What is clear, however, is that the economic value of creativity is moving China closer to greater tolerance. Creativity is changing China "They eat the meat and we have the bone; they eat the rice and we have the husk. " According to Li Wuwei, the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book,</b> Creative Industries are Changing China, these are the sentiments of many Chinese. Li is referring to the Made in China phenomenon, the economic dominance of Chinese factories. He calls these "sweat industries," and he criticises the fact that the profits from these kinds of industries usually go overseas. For Li is time to change China 2 ̆ 7 s development model. If these were the musings of an iconoclast, perhaps even a person like Ai Weiwei, they may be regarded with some degree of ambivalence. However, Professor Li Wuwei from the Shanghai Academy of Social Science is no small player. Li is the vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People 2 ̆ 7 s Political Consultative Conference and vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee. Li Wuwei believes that China 2 ̆ 7 s economic success is no longer limited to attracting foreign enterprises and capital through favourable policies, constructing large-scale industrial precincts, and promoting science and technology. The secret lies in the diversion of attention from "material" to "people," and the construction of what he calls a "creative community. " For many observers of China the important question here is the term creative community. Just what does this mean and how might it be developed? For Li, this is closely linked with Richard Florida 2 ̆ 7 s declaration in The Rise of the Creative Class that cities need a balance of technology, talent and tolerance. Florida attracted much attention by suggesting that the number of bohemians added to a city 2 ̆ 7 s creative index. Unsurprisingly, with his emphasis on tolerance, many of China 2 ̆ 7 s senior cultural policy makers were reluctant to subscribe to Florida 2 ̆ 7 s formula. However, Li 2 ̆ 7 s perceptive interpretation of Florida and his ability to take Ministry of Culture slogans such as "soft power" and "autonomous innovation" and give them credibility in the world of business has a lot to do with his growing influence. Moreover, his vision of a more creative China sits well with Hu Jintao 2 ̆ 7 s prescription for a "harmonious society. " Significantly, it was a report from the Development Research Centre of the State Council in December 2008 that provides the link. The report proposed that China needed to adjust its product structure; in doing this, it needed to encourage enterprises to make more high-value added products rather than continue to rely on cheap labour reserves. • • Li Wuwei 2 ̆ 7 s book was published in December 2008.
