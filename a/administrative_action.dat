5|$|Illegality {{is one of}} {{the three}} broad {{headings}} of judicial review of <b>administrative</b> <b>action</b> in Singapore, the others being irrationality and procedural impropriety. To avoid acting illegally, an administrative body or public authority must correctly understand the law regulating its power to act and to make decisions, and give effect to it.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} held in the UK that when a public {{authority}} exercises a statutory power {{for a number of}} purposes, some of which are unlawful, the applicable test for deciding whether the authority acted illegally is whether the unlawful purpose is incidental to the exercise of the power or if the dominant purpose is itself unlawful. If the primary or dominant purpose is the authorized purpose, the <b>administrative</b> <b>action</b> may be held valid.|$|E

5|$|Errors of law {{committed}} by public authorities when they act or make decisions {{are within the}} jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore to correct by way of judicial review. On the other hand, the Court is generally unwilling to intervene where the alleged error is one that concerns the facts of the matter. The rationale for this rule is that it is the Court's role in judicial review of <b>administrative</b> <b>action</b> to scrutinize the legality and not the merits of the decisions of public authorities.|$|E
5|$|On 17 November 1994 the USAF {{announced}} that Colwell had recommended to Croker that Wang face court-martial and that Halcli receive nonjudicial <b>administrative</b> <b>action</b> on the dereliction of duty charges. Colwell {{recommended that the}} formal dereliction of duty charges be dropped against the other AWACS crew members, but that they could still face nonjudicial action. Croker accepted Colwell's recommendation and ordered Wang to face court-martial and dismissed the criminal charges against the other AWACS crew members except Halcli, who was offered Article 15 action.|$|E
5|$|Martin and Halcli waived {{their rights}} to the Article 32 hearing, meaning that their cases could move {{immediately}} to court-martial or <b>administrative</b> <b>action.</b> Wickson was given immunity by USAF Lieutenant General Eugene Santarelli, commander of the 17th Air Force, to testify at the hearings. The AWACS crew members' hearing, which began on 19 October 1994 at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma was an open hearing and presided over by Colonel William Colwell, USAF, under the legal jurisdiction of Lieutenant General Stephen Croker, USAF, commander of the 8th Air Force. May's hearing, beginning on 7 November 1994 at Sembach Air Base, Germany was a closed hearing and presided over by Colonel Edward M. Starr, USAF, under the legal jurisdiction of Santarelli. Pilkington, Emery, Richardson, and O'Brien declined requests to testify at either hearing.|$|E

5|$|There was {{increased}} looting on December 20, both in Buenos Aires and the Conurbano. The cacerolazos continued; {{large groups of}} people started demonstrations calling for the government's resignation. The unions—first the CTA and then the CGT—began general strikes against the state of emergency. Most of the UCR withdrew their support to De la Rúa, so he asked the PJ to create a government coalition. The PJ refused, and De la Rúa resigned from government. His last <b>administrative</b> <b>action</b> was to lift the state of emergency. He gave his resignation to the Congress at 19:45 local time on December 20, 2001, and left the Casa Rosada in a helicopter. He had ruled for two years, half of his term of office.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to a request for assistance from the Geneva County Sheriff's Office and Samson Police, Army officers ordered federal troops from nearby Fort Rucker to be deployed {{to the streets of}} Samson. They manned traffic stops and guarded a makeshift morgue. An Army investigation later determined this action to be in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits federal troops from performing civil law enforcement actions. The Army took <b>administrative</b> <b>action</b> against at least one officer.|$|E
25|$|In theory, {{when exercising}} {{judicial}} review of <b>administrative</b> <b>action,</b> the Court's task is only {{to ensure that the}} decision in question was made according to the law. Even though it may disagree with the decision, it will not substitute its own decision for that of the decision-maker. In practice, however, it is sometimes difficult to tell whether the Court is applying that principle. The branch of law dealing with this facet of the Court's jurisdiction is administrative law.|$|E

25|$|David Cass was outspoken about {{academic}} and personal freedom. In 1994 he {{became involved in}} an administrative dispute with the University of Pennsylvania over the implications of a consensual faculty-student relationship. At this time he had a consensual relationship with a then-graduate student. When a university policy on faculty-student relationships was adopted Cass was denied the appointment as Chair of the graduate program of the Department of Economics because of this relationship. As the graduate student in question graduated before the planned appointment of Cass as Chair of the department, the timeline of the <b>administrative</b> <b>action</b> rendered the initial objection moot.|$|E

It also expands {{the definition of a}} lobbyist to include a new category -- an “expenditure lobbyist” -- that includes persons who spend more than $2,500 in a month to influence legislation or city <b>administrative</b> <b>action.</b> In addition, Proposition C prohibits expenditure lobbyists from making gifts worth more than $25 to city officers.|$|E

50|$|To {{facilitate}} privilege {{isolation of}} <b>administrative</b> <b>actions,</b> each namespace type is considered {{owned by a}} user namespace based on the active user namespace {{at the moment of}} creation. A user with administrative privileges in the appropriate user namespace will be allowed to perform <b>administrative</b> <b>actions</b> within that other namespace type. For example, if a process has administrative permission to change the IP address of a network interface, it may do so as long as its own user namespace is the same as (or ancestor of) the user namespace that owns the network namespace. Hence the initial user namespace has administrative control over all namespace types in the system.|$|R

25|$|During electoral {{campaign}} of 1923 Chicharro {{was considered a}} favourite. It is not clear to what extent he ruined his chances himself: during one of electoral meetings in the very city of Burriana he was challenged by a local workers’ leader. Chicharro resolved to a stick and engaged in a brawl, resulting in his victim treated in hospital for head wounds and an <b>administrative</b> <b>action</b> taken against the assailant. Diario de Castellón, the newspaper he founded and owned, failed to mobilize enough support and produced merely significant financial losses. Eventually Chicharro and an albista counter-candidate recorded almost the same score; the latter was declared victorious following behind-the-scene dealings.|$|E
25|$|Metro {{has been}} criticized for {{removing}} railroad tracks that were already in place for a significant length of the Orange Line's route, tracks which could have been revitalized and used as part of a true light rail system. In October 2013, Los Angeles City 4th District Councilman Tom LaBonge introduced a motion to support the repeal of Public Utilities Code section 130265 (1991's SB 211, or Robbins Bill) and support of any legislative and/or <b>administrative</b> <b>action</b> by Metro which would prioritize the development of rail-based transit. The motion was passed by the City Council on October 29, 2013 and approved by the Mayor on November 6, 2013.|$|E
25|$|In {{the light}} of {{modernization}} and the resulting necessity for a more interventionist state, administrative law has an increasingly {{important role to play}} in Singapore to ensure that the vulnerable individual has protection and practical remedies against abuse of power by the state. This is particularly so in Singapore's hegemonic, Westminster-based form of parliamentary government where the executive dominates the legislative agenda, because the alternate means of political control – holding the executive accountable to the popularly elected legislature – is almost negligible. The judiciary thus exists as an independent check on executive power and it fulfils this function through judicial review of <b>administrative</b> <b>action.</b> This review jurisdiction of the High Court is to be contrasted with its appellate jurisdiction: the latter is derived from the statutory framework, while judicial review is a power inherent as part of the court's supervisory jurisdiction. Both are designed to address different types of wrongs that an administrative decision-maker may commit.|$|E
