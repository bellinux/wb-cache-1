25|$|Post-financial {{crisis and}} several {{spectacular}} fund governance failures, {{there has been}} much debate among fund directors worldwide about whether the proprietorship or professional firm approach is best for a professional fund. The matter has also been studied extensively by leading independent academic researchers at the Stanford Law Review, University of Kentucky and University of Cambridge among many others. Collectively these independent studies shattered many of the myths about professional fund governance and consistently supported the professional firm model over the proprietor model. Currently there is no independent research that supports the proprietorship model. In the Stanford Law Review, the authors argue â€œwe know of no other service provided for corporations that is obligated by law to be performed by a sole proprietorship, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>good</b> reason. Lawyers, consultants, accountants, doctors, and so on, all associate with each other to form corporate entities to provide their services for a host of well understood reasons".|$|E

500|$|During this period, {{the remains}} of small hollow-crested duckbills were {{described}} as their own genera and species. The first of these that figure {{into the history of}} Hypacrosaurus was Cheneosaurus tolmanensis, based on a skull and assorted limb bones, vertebrae, and pelvic bones from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. Not long after, Richard Swann Lull and Nelda Wright identified an American Museum of Natural History skeleton (AMNH 5461) from the Two Medicine Formation of Montana as a specimen of Procheneosaurus. These and other taxa were accepted as valid genera until the 1970s, when Peter Dodson showed that it was more likely that the [...] "cheneosaurs" [...] were the juveniles of other established lambeosaurines. Although he was mostly concerned with the earlier, Dinosaur Park Formation genera Corythosaurus and Lambeosaurus, he suggested that Cheneosaurus {{would turn out to be}} composed of juvenile individuals of the contemporaneous Hypacrosaurus altispinus. This idea has become accepted, although not formally tested. The Two Medicine Procheneosaurus, meanwhile, was not quite like the other Procheneosaurus specimens studied by Dodson, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>good</b> reason: it was much more like a species that would not be named until 1994, H. stebingeri.|$|E

2500|$|About.com {{gave the}} show {{a rating of}} 4.5 stars. The series {{described}} Arthurs assets: The Arthur series has won several awards including the George Foster Peabody, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>good</b> reason. Arthur presents issues and situations kids can relate to, and teaches positive behaviors and responses to these issues in a genuine and comical way. The series is fun and engaging to the target age group. Kids will relate to the storylines and characters, and will therefore give thought to the responses the characters demonstrate and outcome of those responses. Because [...] "Arthur" [...] presents real childhood issues, the show contains some imitative behavior such as name calling or bickering, much like children experience in their own lives. Kids might hear words like [...] "sissy" [...] or [...] "stupid" [...] and see Arthur and D.W. argue. Should children mimic some of these phrases or tactics, the show provides a good springboard for parents {{to talk about the}} issues with their children and point out the importance of considering others' feelings. The review continued by citing many ways in which children could extract more from the series, for example by encouraging kids to write stories based on their own families (in much the same way Arthur was first realised) or by Kim Brown, Marc Brown's sister, teaching kids to draw Arthur while on tour.|$|E
2500|$|The chief {{difficulty}} lies in how rich Capua in 343 {{can have}} been reduced to such dire straits by the Samnites that the Campani were willing to surrender everything to Rome. [...] During the Second Punic War (218 to 201 BC) Capua famously sided with Carthage, but after a lengthy siege she had to surrender unconditionally in 211 BC, after which the Capuans were harshly punished by Rome. [...] therefore held that the Campanian surrender in 343 is a retrojection by later Roman historians. This invention would serve the double purpose of exonerating Rome from treaty-breaking in 343 and justifying the punishment handed out in 211. What Rome agreed to in 343 was an alliance on terms similar to the treaties she had with the Latins and the Hernici. [...] accepts the surrender as historical. Studies have shown that voluntary submission by one party was a common feature in the diplomacy of this period. [...] Likewise [...] does not believe the surrender of 343 to be a retrojection, not finding many similarities between the events of 343 and 211. [...] The ancient historians record many later instances, whose historicity are not doubted, where a state appealed to Rome for assistance in war against a stronger enemy. [...] The historical evidence shows the Romans considered such supplicants to have technically the same status as surrendered enemies, but in practice Rome would not want to abuse would-be allies. [...] , like Salmon, argues that the surrender in 343 is a retrojection of that of 211, invented to better justify Roman actions <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>good</b> measure shift the guilt for the First Samnite War onto the manipulative Campani.|$|E

2500|$|Jones was {{a logical}} choice for Fisk President. Jones, who {{for seven years}} worked as a {{professor}} of sociology at Hampton Institute, and after a brief stint as a statistician at the Bureau of the Census, joined the newly created Phelps-Stokes Fund in 1912 as its educational director, a position he would hold for over three decades. [...] Despite his unique qualifications for the position, Jones quickly turned down the opportunity, feeling he could do more for Black education in his role with the Phelps-Stokes Fund than he could at a single institution. With Jones no longer interested, responsibility for finding a suitable candidate fell largely to Booker T. Washington, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>good</b> reason. Any serious candidate for the position required the blessing of Washington, Fisk's Board of Trustees and the General Education Board. In March 1914, after a long search, John Cutler Shedd, a professor of physics at Olivet College in Michigan, emerged as the leading candidate for the position. Shedd travelled to New York City to meet with a variety of Fisk stakeholders, including the Carnegie Foundation, officers of the American Missionary Association, academics from Cornell University (all of whom were friends with Booker T. Washington), and Wallace Buttrick. Shortly thereafter, Shedd and his wife visited Fisk's campus, and then proceeded [...] to Tuskegee to meet with Washington. Washington believed Shedd was [...] "the best man we can get for the presidency of Fisk University," [...] but warned of opposition by Fisk alumni and the Nashville Black community who wanted a Black president. He also predicted and a stormy period of two or three years for Shedd and his family to acclimate to the unique conditions of the South. Washington observed most Northerners [...] "make the mistake of expressing opinions before they have had time to get into the local atmosphere of the community, or of the South."
