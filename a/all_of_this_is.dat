No magma has been detected within 10km of the surface, and so the volcano is classified by the Observatory as at a Basic or Green Level.|$|E

25|$|The DM also {{includes}} the ability to save partially complete DSN's, with code and logic to ask the user for any missing information at runtime. For instance, a DSN can be created without a required password. When an ODBC application attempts to connect to the DBMS using this DSN, the system will pause and ask the user to provide the password before continuing. This frees the application developer from having to create this sort of code, as well as having to know which questions to ask. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> included in the driver and the DSNs.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a dozen}} major freeways that {{crisscross}} the region. California's first freeway was the California State Route 110, {{also known}} as the Pasadena Freeway or the Arroyo Seco Parkway. It opened on January 1, 1940 and links downtown Los Angeles to downtown Pasadena. From Chavez Ravine north to Pasadena can be quite dangerous because there is no shoulder, the lanes are narrow, the turns are sharp (and not always properly banked), and the ramps are quite short and offer little room for acceleration to freeway speed; <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> because the freeway was designed for much slower cars of a different era and much less traffic volume than exists today. Commercial vehicles over 6,000 pounds are prohibited from using this freeway. More recent freeways are straighter, wider, and allow for higher speeds.|$|E
25|$|Finally, it is {{discovered}} that the wizard had given {{the daughter of the}} last king of Oz, Princess Ozma, to the old witch Mombi to have her hidden away. Mombi had turned Ozma into a boy named Tip, whom she raised. When <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> revealed Tip is turned back into Ozma and takes her rightful place as the benevolent ruler of all of Oz. Ozma successfully wards off several attempts by various armies to overthrow her. To prevent any upheaval of her rule over Oz, she outlaws the practice of all magic in Oz except by herself, the returned and reformed wizard, and by Glinda, and she has Glinda make all of Oz invisible to outsiders. Ozma remains the ruler of Oz for the entire series.|$|E

25|$|Performers {{then begin}} the main {{compositions}} with a section called raga alapana exploring the raga. In this, {{they use the}} sounds aa, ri, na, ta, etc. instead of swaras to slowly elaborate the notes and flow of the raga. This begins slowly and builds to a crescendo, and finally establishes a complicated exposition of the raga that shows the performer's skill. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> done without any rhythmic accompaniment, or beat. Then the melodic accompaniment (violin or veena), expounds the raga. Experienced listeners can identify many ragas after they hear just a few notes. With the raga thus established, the song begins, usually with lyrics. In this, the accompaniment (usually violin, sometimes veena) performs along with the main performer and the percussion (such as a mridangam). In {{the next stage of}} the song, they may sing niraval or kalpanaswaram again.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{attention}} {{is the process}} where objects in one location are chosen for processing over objects in another location. This would imply that neglect is more intentional. The patient has an affinity to direct attention to the unaffected side. Neglect {{is caused by a}} decrease in stimuli in the contralesional side {{because of a lack of}} ipsilesional stimulation of the visual cortex and an increased inhibition of the contralesional side. In this theory neglect is seen as disorder of attention and orientation caused by disruption of the visual cortex. Patients with this disorder will direct attention and movements to the ipsilesional side and neglect stimuli in the contralesional side despite having preserved visual fields. The result of <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> an increased sensitivity of visual performance in the unaffected side. The patient shows an affinity to the ipsilesional side being unable to disengage attention from that side.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Dover Area School District reports {{employing}} 351 {{teachers and}} administrators with a salary range of $39,277 to $135,200. Teachers earn extra pay for duties such as advising the clubs, writing curriculum or coaching athletics teams. That amount ranges from several hundred dollars a year to a few thousand. When a team progresses past the regular season the coaches are paid additional dollars for each week the teams continues to play. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> stipulated in the teachers' union contract at each district. Additionally, the district's teacher union contract includes seven levels, from a bachelor's degree to a doctorate. A teacher with five years of experience and a doctorate would make about $7,500 more than one with the same experience and a master's degree. A teacher who achieves {{a higher level of}} education receives a raise in step pay and then the annual raise, as well. The school contract year is 190 days. In addition to salary, the teachers receive an extensive benefits package which includes: health insurance, life insurance, vision insurance, dental insurance, a defined benefit pension, 10 paid sick and 2-3 paid personal days, reimbursement for college courses and more.|$|E

25|$|In {{accordance}} with {{the practice of the}} Orthodox Church, a particular hero of faith can initially be canonized only at a local level within local churches and eparchies. Such rights belong to the ruling hierarch and it can only happen when the blessing of the patriarch is received. The task of believers of the local eparchy is to record descriptions of miracles, to create the hagiography of a saint, to paint an icon, as well as to compose a liturgical text of a service where the saint is glorified. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> sent to the Synodal Commission for canonization which decides whether to canonize the local hero of faith or not. Then the patriarch gives his blessing and the local hierarch performs the act of canonization at the local level. However, the liturgical texts in honor of a saint are not published in all Church books but only in local publications. In the same way these saints are not yet glorified and venerated by the whole Church, only locally. When the glorification of a saint exceeds the limits of an eparchy, then the patriarch and Holy Synod decides about their canonization on the Church level. After receiving the Synod’s support and the patriarch’s blessing, the question of glorification of a particular saint on the scale of the entire Church is given for consideration to the Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church.|$|E

Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "B–" [...] and called the episode [...] "thoroughly mundane", especially {{in comparison to the}} preceding episode, [...] "Via Negativa".

500|$|Roger Ebert {{observed}} 12 Monkeys {{depiction of}} the future, finding similarities with Blade Runner (1982; also scripted by David Peoples) and Brazil (1985; also directed by Terry Gilliam). [...] "The film is a celebration of madness and doom, with a hero who tries to prevail against the chaos of his condition, and is inadequate", Ebert wrote. [...] "This vision is a cold, dark, damp one, and even the romance between Willis and Stowe feels desperate rather than joyous. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> done very well, {{and the more you}} know about movies (especially the technical side), the more you're likely to admire it.

500|$|Most of the quatrains {{deal with}} {{disasters}}, such as plagues, earthquakes, wars, floods, invasions, murders, droughts, and battles—all undated {{and based on}} foreshadowings by the Mirabilis Liber. Some quatrains cover these disasters in overall terms; others concern a single person or small group of people. Some cover a single town, others several towns in several countries [...] A major, underlying theme is an impending invasion of Europe by Muslim forces from farther east and south headed by the expected Antichrist, directly reflecting the then-current Ottoman invasions and the earlier Saracen equivalents, {{as well as the}} prior expectations of the Mirabilis Liber. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> presented {{in the context of the}} supposedly imminent end of the world—even though this is not in fact mentioned—a conviction that sparked numerous collections of end-time prophecies at the time, including an unpublished collection by Christopher Columbus.|$|E

500|$|In {{reference}} to the 1978 kung fu film The 36th Chamber of Shaolin that the group enjoyed watching, the Clan considered themselves as lyrical masters of the 36 chambers, and arrived onto the rap scene while appearing to be ahead, and more advanced over others, with [...] "knowledge of 36 chambers of hip hop music when everyone else in hip hop was striving to attain the knowledge of 35 lessons." [...] Also, while the human body has 108 pressure points (1 + 0 + 8 = 9), only the Wu-Tang martial artists learned and understood that 36 of those pressure points are deadly (9 + 36 = 45) (4 + 5 = 9) The lyrics and rhymes of the 9 members are to be considered as 36 deadly lyrical techniques for pressure points. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{the basis for the}} album title, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), being that 9 members x 4 chambers = 36. However, this is just a theory; the true significance of the title is not definitively known.|$|E
500|$|Disasterpieces was {{recorded}} at the now defunct London Dockland Arena in England on February 16, 2002, {{it was one}} of the final dates on the band's European tour which was subsequently their final tour until 2004. The concert was shot with 26 different cameras under the direction of Matthew Amos and documents the show, backstage action and an in-store signing in Paris, France. In addition to operated cameras each band member had an individual camera which was attached to the side of their masks, apart from Mick Thomson whose camera was attached to the headstock of his guitar. The concept behind these cameras was to allow the viewer to see the show from the band member's point of view. However they did cause some discomfort and problems for some band members. Bassist Paul Gray removed his after four songs, explaining that [...] "they gave us this big [...] pack to wear around our waist. So when I was jumping around, the thing started sliding down my leg". Also during the song [...] "Spit It Out" [...] DJ Sid Wilson had his camera stolen when he was in the crowd, however it was returned at the end of the show, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> documented on the DVD.|$|E
500|$|This {{crossover}} occurred {{through the}} Simpsons episode [...] "A Star Is Burns" [...] (1995). Groening was not {{fond of the}} crossover, publicly citing it as a thirty-minute advertisement for The Critic. Brooks said, [...] "for years, Al and Mike were two guys who worked their hearts out on this show, staying up until 4 {{in the morning to}} get it right. The point is, Matt's name has been on Mike's and Al's scripts and he has taken plenty of credit for a lot of their great work. In fact, he is the direct beneficiary of their work. The Critic is their shot and he should be giving them his support." [...] Reiss stated that he was a [...] "little upset" [...] by Groening's actions and that [...] "this taints everything at the last minute. [...] This episode doesn't say 'Watch The Critic all over it." [...] Jean added [...] "What bothers me about <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>is</b> that now people may get the impression that this Simpsons episode is less than good. It stands on its own even if The Critic never existed." [...] On Fox, The Critic was again short-lived, broadcasting ten episodes before its cancellation. A total of only 23 episodes were produced, and it returned briefly in 2000 with a series of ten Internet broadcast webisodes. The series has since developed a cult following thanks to reruns on Comedy Central and its complete series release on DVD.|$|E
