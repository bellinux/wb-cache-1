Hilendarski" [...] and at the Laboratory of biologically active substances in Plovdiv site of the Academy of Sciences. The results obtained lead to the invention of several <b>amide</b> <b>herbicides</b> such as Alachlor, Dual Gold et al. Consequently, several new laboratory and manufacturing technologies were developed with the participation of co-workers from the R&D department of [...] "Agria" [...] chemical plant in Plovdiv. Many new compounds were synthesized with expected pesticide activity that was later confirmed by biological screening {{in the country and}} abroad.|$|E
40|$|A {{bacterium}} strain, {{which is}} capable of degrading monocrotophos, was isolated from sludge collected {{from the bottom of}} a wastewater treatment system of a chemical factory, and named M- 1. On the basis {{of the results of the}} cellular morphology, physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics and phylogenetic similarity of 16 S rDNA gene sequences, the strain was identified as a Paracoccus sp. The ability of the strain to mineralize monocrotophos was investigated under different culture conditions. Other organophosphorus insecticides and <b>amide</b> <b>herbicides</b> were also degraded by M- 1. The key enzyme (s) involved in the initial biodegradation of monocrotophos in M- 1 was shown to be a constitutively expressed cytosolic protein. The addition of M- 1 (106 CFU g 1) to fluvo-aquic soil and a high-sand soil containing monocrotophos (50 mg kg 1) resulted in a higher degradation rate than that obtained from noninoculated soil. This microbial culture has great potential utility for the bioremediation of wastewater or soil contaminated with organophosphorus pesticides and <b>amide</b> <b>herbicides...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{chirality}} of herbicides {{has been}} the focus of research. However, there is little information on the enantioseparation of <b>amide</b> <b>herbicides</b> with different chiral elements. In this study, the need for different chiral stationary phases (CSPs), mobile phases, temperatures and flow rates for the separation of napropamide, acetochlor and propisochlor was discussed in detail and compared to metolachlor. Resolution of C-chiral enantiomers was easier than that of axial-chiral enantiomers. Metolachlor and acetochlor could achieve baseline separation only on AY-H and AS-H columns, respectively. Propisochlor had satisfactory separations on OD-H and AS-H columns. Napropamide was separated on OJ-H, AY-H and AS-H columns. Both the structures of the compounds and CSPs and the interactions between them played significant roles in the enantioseparations. Molecule dockings were also used to elucidate the separation mechanisms. C-chiral enantiomers had perfect symmetry in their optical properties, whereas the axial-chiral enantiomers did not. The elution order for napropamide, acetochlor and propisochlor, with a single chiral location, was R- prior to S-. These results were the first that compare the enantioseparations of four <b>amide</b> <b>herbicides</b> with different chirality, and they provided the absolute configurations for the herbicides. The paper also illustrated certain mechanisms for enantioseparations...|$|E
40|$|Amiprophos-methyl (APM), a phosphoric <b>amide</b> <b>herbicide,</b> was {{previously}} reported to inhibit the in vitro polymerization of isolated plant tubulin (L. C. Morejohn, D. E. Fosket [1984] Science 224 : 874 - 876), yet little other biochemical information exists concerning this compound. To characterize further {{the mechanism of}} action of APM, its interactions with tubulin and microtubules purified from cultured cells of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv Bright Yellow- 2) were investigated. Low micromolar concentrations of APM depolymerized preformed, taxol-stabilized tobacco microtubules. Remarkably, at the lowest APM concentration examined, many short microtubules were redistributed into fewer but 2. 7 -fold longer microtubules without a substantial decrease in total polymer mass, a result consistent with an end-to-end annealing of microtubules with enhanced kinetic properties. Quasi-equilibrium binding measurements showed that tobacco tubulin binds [14 C]oryzalin with high affinity to produce a tubulin-oryzalin complex having a dissociation constant (Kd) = 117 nM (pH 6. 9; 23 [deg]C). Also, an estimated maximum molar binding stoichiometry of 0. 32 indicates pharamacological heterogeneity of tobacco dimers and {{may be related to}} structural heterogeneity of tobacco tubulin subunits. APM inhibits competitively the binding of [14 C]oryzalin to tubulin with an inhibition constant (Ki) = 5 [mu]M, indicating the formation of a moderate affinity tubulin-APM complex that may interact with the ends of microtubules. APM concentrations inhibiting tobacco cell growth were within the threshold range of APM concentrations that depolymerized cellular microtubules, indicating that growth inhibition is caused by microtubules depolymerization. APM had no apparent effect on microtubules in mouse 3 T 3 fibroblasts. Because cellular microtubules were depolymerized at APM and oryzalin concentrations below their respective Ki and Kd values, both herbicides are proposed to depolymerize microtubules by a substoichiometric endwise mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Herbicide {{contamination}} of streams {{has been well}} documented, but little is currently known about the specific factors affecting watershed vulnerability to herbicide transport. The primary objectives {{of this study were}} (1) to document herbicide occurrence and transport from watersheds in the northern Missouri/ southern Iowa region; (2) to quantify watershed vulnerability to herbicide transport and relate vulnerability to soil properties; and (3) to compute the contribution of this region to the herbicide load of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. Grab samples were collected under baseflow and runoff conditions at 21 hydrologic monitoring stations between April 15 and July 15 from 1996 to 1999. Samples were analyzed for commonly used soil-applied herbicides (atrazine, cyanazine, acetochlor, alachlor, metolachlor, and metribuzin) and four triazine metabolites (deisopropylatrazine, deethylatrazine, hydroxyatrazine, and cyanazine <b>amide).</b> Estimates of <b>herbicide</b> load and relative losses were computed for each watershed. Median parent herbicide losses, as a percentage of applied, ranged from 0. 33 to 3. 9 %; loss rates that were considerably higher than other areas of the United States. Watershed vulnerability to herbicide transport, measured as herbicide load per treated area, showed that the runoff potential of soils was a critical factor affecting herbicide transport. Herbicide transport from these watersheds contributed a disproportionately high amount of the herbicide load to both the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. Based on these results, this region of the Corn Belt is highly vulnerable to transport of herbicides from fields to streams, and it should be targeted for implementation of management practices designed to reduce herbicide losses in surface runoff...|$|R
40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [21377105, 21077085]; Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry; New Century Excellent Talents in Fujian Province UniversityIn this study, a new boronate {{affinity}} sorbent {{based on}} poly(4 -vinylphenylboronic acid-divinylbenzene) monolith (VPB-DB) was prepared {{and used as}} extractive medium of stir cake sorptive extraction (SCSE). The effect of the preparation parameters in the polymerization mixture on extraction performance was investigated thoroughly. The sorbent was characterized by infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy and mercury intrusion porosimetry. The determination of 8 sulfonamides in environmental water samples with the combination of SCSE and high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry detection was selected as a paradigm {{for the evaluation of}} extraction performance of poly(VPB-DB) monolith for nitrogen-containing pollutants. Under the optimal extraction conditions, the limits of detection (S/N= 3) and limits of quantification (S/N= 10) for the target analytes were 0. 0012 - 0. 010 and 0. 0040 - 0. 033 mu g/L, respectively. The method also showed good linearity, repeatability, recoveries and high feasibility. At the same time, aromatic amines, nitrophenols, <b>amide</b> <b>herbicides</b> and sudan dyes were also used to evaluate the extractive performance of the sorbent for nitrogen-containing compounds. Results well indicate that the interaction of boron-nitrogen coordination between sorbent and analytes {{plays a key role in}} the extraction of nitrogen-containing compounds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.
