5|$|Ten {{minutes after}} the French opened fire Goliath, {{ignoring}} fire from the fort to starboard and from Guerrier to port, most of which was too high to trouble the ship, crossed {{the head of the}} French line. Captain Thomas Foley had noticed as he approached that there was an unexpected gap between Guerrier and the shallow water of the shoal. On his own initiative, Foley decided to exploit this tactical error and changed his <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> to sail through the gap. As the bow of Guerrier came within range, Goliath opened fire, inflicting severe damage with a double-shotted raking broadside as the British ship turned to port and passed down the unprepared port side of Guerrier. Foley's Royal Marines and a company of Austrian grenadiers joined the attack, firing their muskets. Foley had intended to anchor alongside the French ship and engage it closely, but his anchor took too long to descend and his ship passed Guerrier entirely. Goliath eventually stopped close to the bow of Conquérant, opening fire on the new opponent and using the unengaged starboard guns to exchange occasional shots with the frigate Sérieuse and bomb vessel Hercule, which were anchored inshore of the battle line.|$|E

500|$|It {{was about}} 4:00 pm, over 6 hours {{since the two}} fleets had first sighted each other, when the British—who had the weather gage, and {{therefore}} the initiative—opened their attack. The battle began with [...] opening fire against the Marseillais, its counterpart near {{the head of the}} line. The action very quickly became general, with the van and center of each line fully engaged. The French, in a practice they were known for, tended to aim at British masts and rigging, with the intent of crippling their opponent's mobility. The effects of this tactic were apparent in the engagement: [...] and HMS Intrepid, {{at the head of the}} British line, became virtually impossible to manage, and eventually fell out of the line. The rest of Admiral Drake's squadron also suffered heavy damage, but the casualties were not as severe as those taken on the first two ships. The <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> of the British line also played a role in the damage they sustained; ships in their van were exposed to raking fire when only their bow guns could be brought to bear on the French.|$|E

6000|$|All we writers find {{ourselves}} engaged perforce in some part or other of a world-wide propaganda of this {{the most creative}} and hopeful of political ideas that has ever dawned upon the consciousness of mankind. With no concerted plan we feel called upon to serve it. And in no connection would one so like to think oneself un-original as in this connection. It would be a dismaying thing to realize that one were writing anything here which was not the possible thought of great multitudes of other people, and capable of becoming the common thought of mankind. One writes in such a book as this not to express oneself but to swell a chorus. The idea of the League of Nations is so great a one that it may well override the pretensions and command the allegiance of kings; much more does it claim the self-subjugation of the journalistic writer. Our innumerable books upon this great edifice of a World Peace do not constitute a scramble for attention, but an attempt to express in every variety of phrase and aspect this one system of ideas which now possesses us all. In {{the same way the}} elementary facts and ideas of the science of chemistry might conceivably be put completely and fully into one text-book, but, as a matter of fact, it is far more convenient to tell that same story over in a thousand different forms, in a text-book for boys here, for a different sort or class of boy there, for adult students, for reference, for people expert in mathematics, for people unused to the scientific method, and so on. For the last year the writer has been doing what he can--and a number of other writers have been doing what they can--to bring about a united declaration of all the Atlantic Allies in favour of a League of Nations, and to define the necessary nature of that League. He has, {{in the course of this}} work, written a series of articles upon the League and upon the necessary sacrifices of preconceptions that the idea involves in the London press. He has also been trying to clear his own mind upon the real meaning of that ambiguous word [...] "democracy," [...] for which the League is to make the world [...] "safe." [...] The bulk of this book is made up of these discussions. For a very considerable number of readers, it may be well to admit here, it can have no possible interest; they will have come at these questions themselves from different angles and they will have long since got to their own conclusions. But there may be others whose <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> may be similar to the writer's, who may have asked some or most of the questions he has had to ask, and who may be actively interested in the answers and the working out of the answers he has made to these questions. For them this book is printed.|$|E

This construction {{was placed on}} the highway N 44 in the Dutch municipality of Wassenaar. The study consists of two phases. In the first phase a passenger car and a lorry are used in the mathematical simulations of the modified Vecu Sec.

The second phase of the study describes the results of the mathematical simulations. The VEDYAC (VEhicle DYnamics And Crash dynamics) (VEhicle DYnamics And Crash dynamics) computer program was used. The study shows reasonable results of the simulated crashes with the passenger car. However, the results of the collisions with the lorry show that the modified Vecu Sec construction is too low.
