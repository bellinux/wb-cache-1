5000|$|Terminology {{surrounding}} biopharmaceuticals varies {{between groups}} and entities, with different terms referring to different subsets of therapeutics within the general biopharmaceutical category. Some regulatory agencies use the terms biological medicinal products or therapeutic biological product to refer specifically to engineered macromolecular products like protein- and nucleic acid-based drugs, distinguishing them from products like blood, blood components, or vaccines, {{which are usually}} extracted directly from a biological source. Specialty drugs, a recent classification of pharmaceuticals, are high-cost drugs that are often biologics. The European Medicines Agency uses the term <b>advanced</b> <b>therapy</b> medicinal products (ATMPs) for medicines for human use that are [...] "based on genes, cells, or tissue engineering", including gene therapy medicines, somatic-cell therapy medicines, tissue-engineered medicines, and combinations thereof. Within EMA contexts, the term advanced therapies refers specifically to ATMPs, although that term is rather nonspecific outside of those contexts.|$|E
5000|$|... == Risk Assessment == When {{quality control}} of TEMPs is considered, a risk {{assessment}} needs to be conducted. A risk {{is defined as a}} “potentially unfavourable effect that {{can be attributed to the}} clinical use of <b>advanced</b> <b>therapy</b> medicinal products (ATMPs) and is of concern to the patient and/or to other populations (e.g. caregivers and off-spring)”. Some risks include immunogenicity, disease transmission, tumor formation, treatment failure, undesirable tissue formation, and inadvertent germ transduction. A risk factor is defined as a “qualitative or quantitative characteristic that contributes to a specific risk following handling and/or administration of an ATMP”. The integration of all available information on risks and risk factors is called risk profiling. Due to the fact that every TEMP is different, the risks associated with each one of them vary and, subsequently, the procedures that must be implemented to ensure its quality are also unique to the product. Once the risks associated with the TEMP are identified, the appropriate tests must be developed and validated accordingly. Thus, there is no standard set of tests for the quality control of TEMPs. The EMA has released a set of regulatory guidelines on the topics to be considered by companies involved in the development and marketing of medicines for use in the European Union. These guidelines have to be followed in order for the marketing authorization of a product to be issued. Fictitious examples of risk analysis for further elucidation of the process are provided in the EMA guidelines.|$|E

40|$|Background: Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension with Eisenmenger syndrome as its most advanced form {{is an important}} complication of congenital heart disease. In the recent years, <b>advanced</b> <b>therapy</b> for pulmonary {{arterial hypertension}} has been introduced. Efficacy and safety of the <b>advanced</b> <b>therapy</b> in our patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease were analyzed. Methods: We have analyzed the results of <b>advanced</b> <b>therapy</b> for pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients treated between November 2007 and December 2011. Clinical status, systemic oxygen saturation measured by systemic pulse oximetry, six-minute walking distance and laboratory parameters were assessed. Results at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months of treatment were compared to baseline parameters. Results: In the observed period, 23 patients were treated with <b>advanced</b> <b>therapy</b> for pulmonary arterial hypertension. As a first-line drug bosentan was used in 19 and sildenafil in 4 patients. Due to clinical worsening, a second- and a third-line drug had to be added {{during the study period}} in 4 and 1 patient, respectively. Eighteen patients (78. 3 %) reported improvement in functional capacity. Two patients (8. 6 %) died. The mean six-minute walking distance significantly increased over time from 334. 7 ± 87. 7 m at baseline to 348. 5 ± 89. 1 m at 3 months (p= 0. 002), 373. 2 ± 74. 4 m at 6 months (p= 0. 005), 383. 2 ± 62. 3 m at 12 months (p= 0. 017) and 396. 3 ± 92. 8 m at 24 months of treatment. No significant adverse events were reported. Conclusions: <b>Advanced</b> <b>therapy</b> for pulmonary arterial hypertension is beneficial in patients with congenital heart disease.

The Good Manufacturing Practice Guidelines suggest some recommendations in order to prevent cross-contaminations and require a demonstration that the implemented actions are effective. Here we report some practical examples useful both to minimize crosscontamination risks in an <b>Advanced</b> <b>Therapy</b> Medicinal Products production process and to evaluate the efficacy of the adopted measures...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: Advanced therapies (prostacyclin analogues, endothelin {{receptor}} antagonists) are {{successfully used}} {{in the treatment of}} idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. In addition, patients with the Eisenmenger syndrome (ES) seem to benefit from these news drugs regarding symptoms, but there is still no evidence for changes in outcome. METHODS AND RESULTS: The clinical course of 43 patients (M/F 13 / 30, age 34. 0 +/- 12. 7 years), registered with unstable ES in our database, was retrospectively analysed. These patients were divided into two groups: those treated with and those treated without <b>advanced</b> <b>therapy.</b> The primary endpoint was defined as death from any cause. Death or inscription on the active waiting list of heart-lung transplantation was considered as secondary endpoint. Kaplan-Meier survival and log rank testing were performed to determine differences in outcome between the two groups. The total cohort was followed for a median period of 4. 9 (range 0. 2 - 14. 9) years. Mean survival time for patients treated with (n = 26) and without (n = 17) <b>advanced</b> <b>therapy</b> therapies were 8. 5 +/- 1. 5 and 8. 5 +/- 0. 9 years, respectively (log rank testing, P = 0. 31). However, the mean time to death or inscription on the active waiting list was significantly longer for patients treated with <b>advanced</b> <b>therapy</b> when compared with those without (7. 8 +/- 1. 0 vs. 3. 4 +/- 0. 9 years, P = 0. 006). CONCLUSION: For the given follow-up period, no improvement in survival time could be documented in adult patients with unstable ES treated with <b>advanced</b> <b>therapy.</b> However, we might suggest with these data that the need for heart-lung transplantation can be substantially delayed with new drugs. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Monogenic {{diseases}} are ideal candidates for treatment by the emerging <b>advanced</b> <b>therapies,</b> which {{are capable of}} correcting alterations in protein expression that result from genetic mutation. In hemophilia A and B such alterations affect the activity of coagulation factors VIII and IX, respectively, and {{are responsible for the}} development of the disease. <b>Advanced</b> <b>therapies</b> may involve the replacement of a deficient gene by a healthy gene so that it generates a certain functional,structural or transport protein (gene therapy); the incorporation of a full array of healthy genes and proteins through perfusion or transplantation of healthy cells (cell therapy); or tissue transplantation and formation of healthy organs (tissue engineering). For their part, induced pluripotent stem cells have recently been shown to also play a significant role in the fields of cell therapy and tissue engineering. Hemophilia is optimally suited for <b>advanced</b> <b>therapies</b> owing to the fact that, as a monogenic condition, it does not require very high expression levels of a coagulation factor to reach moderate disease status. As a result, significant progress has been possible with respect to these kinds of strategies, especially in the fields of gene therapy (by using viral and non-viral vectors) and cell therapy (by means of several types of target cells). Thus, although still considered a rare disorder, hemophilia is now recognized as a condition amenable to gene therapy, which can be administered in the form of lentiviral and adeno-associated vectors applied to adult stem cells, autologous fibroblasts, platelets and hematopoietic stem cells; by means of non-viral vectors; or through the repair of mutations by chimeric oligonucleotides. In hemophilia, cell therapy approaches have been based mainly on transplantation of healthy cells (adult stem cells or induced pluripotent cell-derived progenitor cells) in order to restore alterations in coagulation factor expression...|$|R
