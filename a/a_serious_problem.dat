5|$|Poaching is <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> in the country, {{particularly}} of elephants for the profitable ivory industry {{and a threat}} to lives of rangers even in the national parks such as Zakouma. Elephants are often massacred in herds {{in and around the}} parks by organized poaching. The problem is worsened {{by the fact that the}} parks are understaffed and that a number of wardens have been murdered by poachers.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{meaning of}} Keynes's {{work has been}} long debated. Even the {{interpretation}} of Keynes's policy prescription for unemployment, {{one of the more}} explicit parts of General Theory, {{has been the subject of}} debates. Economists and scholars debate whether Keynes intended his advice to be a major policy shift to address <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> or a moderately conservative solution to deal with a minor issue.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} discovery Wigner {{made during}} the project was the Wigner effect. This is a swelling of the graphite moderator caused by the displacement of atoms by neutron radiation. The Wigner effect was <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> for the reactors at the Hanford Site in the immediate post-war period, and resulted in production cutbacks and a reactor being shut down entirely. It was eventually discovered {{that it could be}} overcome by controlled heating and annealing.|$|E
5|$|As {{the colonists}} fenced off more land, the Noongar were {{increasingly}} {{denied access to}} their traditional hunting grounds and sacred sites. In search of food, the Noongar raided the settlers' crops and killed their cattle. They also developed a taste for the settlers' supplies, and began to take flour and other food, which became <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> for the colony. In addition, the Noongar practice of firestick farming: firing the bush to flush out game and encourage germination of undergrowth for sustainability, threatened the settlers' crops and houses.|$|E
5|$|Continued ingress {{of water}} from the roof and from unroofed {{exterior}} walkways above the ceiling level had caused seepage which carried down salts from the building mortar and deposited them on the ceiling through evaporation. In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration was <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem,</b> bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of the ceiling permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.|$|E
50|$|Loose smut has {{recently}} become <b>a</b> more <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> in the Ladakh {{region in the}} Himalayan mountains of India. This area has been particularly affected by global climate change and has experienced many new crop pests and diseases because of it. Barley is an important staple crop in this region and although loose smut {{is not the most}} prevalent disease of barley in the region, {{it has the potential to}} develop into <b>a</b> more <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> in coming years.|$|R

5|$|Litter {{accumulation}} is {{a perennial}} {{problem in the}} subway system. In the 1970s and 1980s, dirty trains and platforms, as well as graffiti were <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem.</b> The situation had improved since then, but the 2010 budget crisis, which caused over 100 of the cleaning staff to lose their jobs, threatened to curtail trash removal from the subway system. Every day, the MTA removes 40 tons of trash from 3,500 trash receptacles.|$|E
5|$|Most park {{visitors}} stay {{just for}} the day, and visit only those locations within Yosemite Valley that are easily accessible by automobile. There is a US$25-30 per automobile user fee to enter the park, depending on the season. Traffic congestion in the valley is <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> during peak season, in summer. A free shuttle bus system operates year-round in the valley, and park rangers encourage people to use this system since parking within the valley during the summer is often nearly impossible to find.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 1944, Williams married Audrey Sheppard. It was {{her second}} {{marriage}} and his first. Their son, Randall Hank Williams, who would achieve fame {{in his own}} right as Hank Williams Jr., was born on May 26, 1949. The marriage, always turbulent, rapidly disintegrated, and Williams developed <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> with alcohol, morphine, and other painkillers prescribed for him to ease the severe back pain caused by his spina bifida. The couple divorced on May 29, 1952.|$|E

5|$|Smaller {{numbers of}} {{children}} show less positive development at age 12 months. Their less desirable attachment styles may be predictors of poor later social development. Although these children's behavior at 12 months is not <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem,</b> {{they appear to be}} on developmental trajectories that will end in poor social skills and relationships. Because attachment styles may serve as predictors of later development, it may be appropriate to think of certain attachment styles as part of the range of attachment disorders.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackcurrant}} leaf midge {{can cause}} browning, crimping and distortion of leaves at {{the tips of}} shoots but it is seldom <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem.</b> The blackcurrant sawfly (Nematus ribesii) lays its eggs {{on the underside of}} the leaves and the voracious larvae work their way along the shoots, stripping off leaf after leaf. In a serious attack, the bush can be denuded of leaves. Larvae of the currant borer drill their way along the centres of shoots, which wilt and die back. Other insect pests include scale insects, aphids and earwigs.|$|E
5|$|Within {{weeks of}} {{the launch of the}} telescope, the {{returned}} images indicated <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> with the optical system. Although the first images appeared to be sharper than those of ground-based telescopes, Hubble failed to achieve a final sharp focus and the best image quality obtained was drastically lower than expected. Images of point sources spread out over a radius of more than one arcsecond, instead of having a point spread function (PSF) concentrated within a circle 0.1arcsec in diameter as had been specified in the design criteria.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the threat}} from the French Fleet had been neutralised, Cunningham was still aware of {{the threat posed by}} the Italian Fleet to British North African operations, based in Egypt. Although the Royal Navy had won in several actions in the Mediterranean, {{considerably}} upsetting the balance of power, the Italians who were following the theory of a fleet in being had left their ships in harbour. This made the threat of a sortie against the British Fleet <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem.</b> At the time the harbour at Taranto contained six battleships (five of them battle-worthy), seven heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and eight destroyers. The Admiralty, concerned with the potential for an attack, had drawn up Operation Judgement; a surprise attack on Taranto Harbour. To carry out the attack, the Admiralty sent the new aircraft carrier , commanded by Lumley Lyster, to join HMS Eagle in Cunningham's fleet.|$|E
5|$|As {{elsewhere}} in major US cities, the 1960s was a turbulent decade for the city. Numerous {{civil rights and}} anti-war protests took place, including large protests led by Marie Hicks to desegregate Girard College. Students took over the Community College of Philadelphia in a sit-in, race riots broke out in Holmesburg Prison, and a 1964 riot along West Columbia Avenue killed two people, injured over 300 and caused around US$3 million in damages. Crime was also <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem.</b> Primarily drug-related gang warfare plagued the city, and in 1970 crime was rated the city's number one problem in a City Planning Commission survey. The court system was overtaxed and the tactics {{of the police department}} under Police Commissioner Frank Rizzo were controversial. Frank Rizzo was credited with preventing the level of violence seen in other cities at the time and was elected mayor in 1971.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} the {{fighting}} ceased for almost two weeks and during this time the 39th was joined by the 53rd and the 30th Brigade headquarters; and Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Honner arrived from Ilolo to take command. Reaching the battalion at Isurava on 16 August, he subsequently began organising the battalion's defence of Isurava. On 23 August Brigadier Arnold Potts took over command of Maroubra Force and further reinforcements arrived as first the 2/14th, 2/16th and later the 2/27th Battalions from the 7th Division's 21st Brigade also reached the area. Despite this, the situation remained bleak as the supply issue was becoming <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> for the Australians and the reinforcements that had arrived were also {{in a state of}} disarray having been committed to the battle in a piecemeal fashion and suffering badly from hunger and disease.|$|E
50|$|Development {{took longer}} than expected. While the 7090 was being {{installed}} at GM Research in Warren, MI, the GM teams were given use {{of one of}} IBM's own 7090s in Kingston, NY. As the original production date grew closer the number of GM employees traveling to NY became <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> budget <b>problem,</b> which was addressed when GM rented a Convair aircraft for ferry flights between the two sites. <b>A</b> more <b>serious</b> <b>problem</b> was the scanner system, and a joint GM-IBM team was able to finally address the issues.|$|R
