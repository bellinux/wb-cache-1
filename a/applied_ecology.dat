5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{mitigate}} damage by camas pocket gophers to sensitive habitat, the Oregon Department of Transportation and the Institute for <b>Applied</b> <b>Ecology</b> trap and relocate the animals. At a site south of Philomath, Oregon, the IAE is working to protect a small but viable population of Kincaid's lupine (Lupinus sulphureus). This threatened flower is the primary host plant for the endangered Fender's blue butterfly (Icaricia icarioides fenderi), which is endemic to the Willamette Valley. The gophers are relocated to a nearby location distant from the lupines.|$|E

This linear approach does not prepare one for understanding and <b>applying</b> <b>ecology</b> {{in the context of}} the modern world. A different, rather unconventional approach is needed for understanding ecology and environmental biology, one that asks the question that is rarely asked — What is the significance of biodiversity to human wellbeing?

25|$|Research by Australian Antarctic Division scientists, {{published}} in the 13 January 2009 edition of the British Ecological Society's Journal of <b>Applied</b> <b>Ecology,</b> suggested {{that the success of}} the feral cat eradication program has allowed the rabbit population to increase, damaging the Macquarie Island ecosystem by altering significant areas of island vegetation. However, in a comment {{published in}} the same journal other scientists argued that a number of factors (primarily a reduction {{in the use of the}} Myxoma virus) were almost certainly involved and the absence of cats may have been relatively minor among them. The original authors examined the issue in a later reply and concluded that the effect of the Myxoma virus use was small and reaffirmed their original position.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Dr. Kurt Benirschke, a Professor of Reproductive Medicine and Pathology at the University of California, San Diego, became {{chairman}} of the university's advisory committee to the Zoological Society dealing with research and animal reproduction. He organized the committee to prepare a white paper describing the need for in-house research to examine the problems of breeding and sustaining endangered species populations in captivity. In 1975 Benirschke and then-San Diego Zoo Director Charles Bieler established a new research department at the Zoo, the Center for Research on Endangered Species (CRES; later renamed the Center for Reproduction of Endangered Species), with Benirschke as its director. Originally based in the Zoo's Biological Research Institute built 49 years prior, CRES eventually expanded to eight research- and education-centered divisions—Field Programs, <b>Applied</b> Animal <b>Ecology,</b> <b>Applied</b> Plant <b>Ecology,</b> Behavioral Biology, Genetics, Reproductive Physiology, Wildlife Disease Laboratories, and Conservation Education—employing over 150 scientists participating in over 160 conservation studies and projects in 35 countries.|$|R
