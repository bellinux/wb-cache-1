In the figure above-right, the rg chromaticity coordinates are {{shown on the}} two axes in black, along with the gamut of the 1931 standard observer. Shown in red are the CIE xy chromaticity axes which were determined by the above requirements. The requirement that the XYZ coordinates be non-negative means that the triangle formed by Cr, Cg, Cb must encompass the entire gamut of the standard observer. The line connecting Cr and Cb is fixed by the requirement that the [...] function be equal to the luminance function. This line is the line of zero luminance, and is called the <b>alychne.</b> The requirement that the [...] function be zero above [...] means that the line connecting Cg and Cr must be tangent to the gamut {{in the region of}} Kr. This defines the location of point Cr. The requirement that the equal energy point be defined by [...] puts a restriction on the line joining Cb and Cg, and finally, the requirement that the gamut fill the space puts a second restriction on this line to be very close to the gamut in the green region, which specifies the location of Cg and Cb. The above described transformation is a linear transformation from the CIE RGB space to XYZ space. The standardized transformation settled upon by the CIE special commission was as follows: ...|$|E

The triangle Cb-Cg-Cr is just the xy = (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0) triangle in CIE xy chromaticity space. The line connecting Cb and Cr is the <b>alychne.</b> Notice that the spectral locus passes through rg = (0, 0) at 435.8 nm, through rg = (0, 1) at 546.1 nm and through rg = (1, 0) at 700 nm. Also, the equal energy point (E) is at rg = xy = (1/3, 1/3).|$|E
