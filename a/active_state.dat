Plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, have a particularly great diversity of isoforms. The active site of thioredoxin consists of two neighboring cysteines, {{as part of a}} highly conserved CXXC motif, that can cycle between an active dithiol form (reduced) and an oxidized disulfide form. In its <b>active</b> <b>state,</b> thioredoxin acts as an efficient reducing agent, scavenging reactive oxygen species and maintaining other proteins in their reduced state. After being oxidized, the active thioredoxin is regenerated by the action of thioredoxin reductase, using NADPH as an electron donor.|$|E

His arrest was touted as the most significant development in the case since Kasab's arrest. Security agencies had been chasing him for three years in Delhi. Ansari is a Lashker-e-Taiba ultra and the Hindi tutor of the 10 attackers who were responsible for the Mumbai attacks in 2008. He was apprehended, after he was arrested and deported to India by Saudi Intelligence officials as per official request by Indian authorities. After Ansari's arrest, investigations revealed that in 2009 he allegedly stayed for a day in a room in Old Legislators's Hostel, belonging to Fauzia Khan, a former MLA and minister in Maharashtra Government. The minister, however, denied having any links with him. Home Minister P. Chidambaram, asserted that Ansari was provided a safe place in Pakistan and was present in the control room, which could not have been established without <b>active</b> <b>State</b> support. Ansari's interrogation further revealed that Sajid Mir and a Pakistani Army major visited India under fake names as cricket spectators to survey targets in Delhi and Mumbai for about a fortnight.|$|E
30|$|A GPCR {{molecule}} contains seven transmembrane (TM) helices (Palczewski et al. 2000). Activation of the GPCR {{is associated}} with a conformational rearrangement of the 7 -TM domain. Here, opening of the cytosolic side of the 7 -TM domain facilitates interactions with downstream effectors such as G-proteins (Rasmussen et al. 2011). Roughly speaking, a typical GPCR possesses two major states: the ground (R) and <b>active</b> (R*) <b>states</b> (Zhang et al. 2014; Lamichhane et al. 2015). Although multiple <b>active</b> <b>states</b> have been proposed to explain so-called biased-signaling phenomena (Onaran et al. 2014), the two-state model remains the cornerstone of the GPCR activation study: the free-energy differences and energy barriers between the multiple <b>active</b> <b>states</b> are usually significantly smaller than those between the ground and <b>active</b> <b>states.</b> It {{is important to note that}} multiple <b>active</b> <b>states</b> are not sequential steps in the activation process. Instead, they are thermodynamically parallel to and equilibrate with each other. Therefore, the two-state model is a reasonable approximation of GPCR activation and multiple activation states may be considered as a perturbation to the two-state model.|$|R

5|$|Sangay can and {{has been}} climbed. It was first ascended in 1929 by Robert T. Moore, prior to its current {{eruption}} beginning in 1934. However, the volcano's current <b>active</b> <b>state</b> presents dangers to mountaineers {{in the form of}} falling ejecta; in 1976, two members of an expedition on the volcano were struck and killed by falling debris. In addition, the volcano is located in a remote region with poor roads and is difficult to access, and periods of heavy rainfall can flood rivers and cause landslides, rendering the mountain routes impassable. Nonetheless, the Instituto Ecuatoriano Forestal y de Areas Naturales, which maintains an office near the mountain, facilitate such activities by providing local guides and rooms for rent to visitors. Ascension takes between 7 and 10 days from Quito. Conditions on the volcano are usually very wet and foggy, which may impair visibility significantly during the ascent.|$|E
25|$|Binding of an agonist ligand to the CB1 {{receptor}} provokes a {{conformational change}} {{and leads to}} the <b>active</b> <b>state</b> of the receptor {{which is responsible for}} the signal transduction. However, there is an additional mechanism that can lead to the <b>active</b> <b>state</b> in the absence of ligand. As numerous other GPCRs, CB1 receptor displays a high level of constitutive activity and thus it can spontaneously adopt an active conformational state in the absence of agonist binding, keeping elevated basal levels of intracellular signaling. This {{can be explained by the}} two state-model of receptor activation in which receptors are in equilibrium between two states, active and inactive (R* and R). An agonist will stabilize the <b>active</b> <b>state</b> leading to activation, a neutral antagonist binds equally to active and inactive states, whereas an inverse agonist will preferentially stabilize the inactive state (Figure 3).|$|E
25|$|Aconitine binds to the {{receptor}} at the neurotoxin {{binding site}} 2 on the alpha-subunit {{of the channel}} protein. This binding results in a sodium-ion channel that stays open longer. Aconitine suppresses the conformational change in the sodium-ion channel from the <b>active</b> <b>state</b> to the inactive state. The membrane stays depolarized due to the constant sodium influx (which is 10-1000 fold greater than the potassium efflux). As a result, the membrane cannot be repolarized. The binding of aconitine to the channel also leads to the channel to change conformation from the inactive state to the <b>active</b> <b>state</b> at a more negative voltage.|$|E

25|$|In the {{canonical}} pathway, Wnt proteins binds to its transmembrane receptor of the Frizzled family of proteins. The binding of Wnt to a Frizzled protein activates the Dishevelled protein. In its <b>active</b> <b>state</b> the Dishevelled protein inhibits {{the activity of}} the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) enzyme. Normally active GSK3 prevents the dissociation of β-catenin to the APC protein, which results in β-catenin degradation. Thus inhibited GSK3, allows β-catenin to dissociate from APC, accumulate, and travel to nucleus. In the nucleus β-catenin associates with Lef/Tcf transcription factor, which is already working on DNA as a repressor, inhibiting the transcription of the genes it binds. Binding of β-catenin to Lef/Tcf works as a transcription activator, activating the transcription of the Wnt-responsive genes.|$|E

2500|$|To achieve full {{activity}} and stabilize the <b>active</b> <b>state,</b> the activation loop of c-Raf {{needs to be}} phosphorylated. The only kinases currently known to perform this act are the Raf family kinases themselves. But some other kinases, such as PAK1 can phosphorylate other residues near the kinase domain of c-Raf: the precise role of these auxiliary kinases is unknown. In the context of c-Raf, both c-Raf and KSR1 are needed for the [...] "transphosphorylation" [...] step. Due to {{the architecture of the}} dimers, this phosphorylation can only take place in trans (i.e. one dimer phosphorylates another, in a four-membered transitional complex). [...] By interacting with conserved Arg and Lys residues in the kinase domain, the phosphorylated activation loops shift conformation and become ordered, permanently locking the kinase domain into a fully <b>active</b> <b>state</b> until dephosphorylated. The phosphorylated activation loops also render the kinase insensitive to the presence of its autoinhibitory domain. KSRs cannot undergo this last step as they miss any phosphorylatable residues in their activation loops. But once c-Raf is fully activated, there is no further need to do so: active Raf enzymes can now engage their substrates. Like most protein kinases, c-Raf has multiple substrates. BAD (Bcl2-atagonist of cell death) is directly phosphorylated by c-Raf, along with several types of adenylate cyclases, myosin phosphatase (MYPT), cardiac muscle troponin T (TnTc), etc. The retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and Cdc25 phosphatase were also suggested as possible substrates.|$|E
