40|$|When {{conducting}} a computer-based assessment, several infringements of <b>assessment</b> <b>regulations</b> could arise. Examples are illegal communication (e. g. by email, web, cell phone), hiding of computer objects {{with the aim}} of accessing or utilizing it, impersonation of another learner and presenting the project of another learner. If infringement is suspected, a computer forensic investigation should be launched. Almost no academic institution has a computer forensic department that can assist with a computer forensic investigation and therefore the responsibility rests upon the lecturer. The purpose of this project is to apply forensic principles to a computer-based assessment environment in order to facilitate the identification and prosecution of any party that contravenes <b>assessment</b> <b>regulations.</b> The aim of the current paper is to consider the nature of a forensic ready computer-based assessment environment in more detail.

40|$|During recent years, Congress has enacted two {{important}} laws relating to assessment work. One is Public Law 85 - 876 (Sept. 2, 1958), allowing assessment credit for expenditures covering performance of {{certain types of}} technological survey work. The other is Public Law 85 - 736 (Aug. 23, 1958), changing {{the date of the}} assessment year. In themselves, both laws are readily understandable. Unfortunately,-however I their enactment at a time wheh prospectors were still bewildered by Public Law 167 (July 23, 1955), and its maze of procedural requirements, resulted in confused interpretations on the part of many. For this reason an attempt has been made here to clarify the problem by summarizing and discuss-ing <b>assessment</b> <b>regulations.</b> History: Federal laws governing the rights of a discoverer with respect to mineral resources on the public domain were first enacted on a comprehensive scale by Congress on May 10, 1872. These laws included requirements for the performance of assessment work as a condition for the holding of unpatented mining claims. Few changes {{have been made in the}} original statutes dealing with assessment. For this reason present-day <b>assessment</b> <b>regulations</b> represent the original law as it has been extended, modified, and clarified by years of judicial rul ings. The original law has been tested to the extent that conflicting interpretations have been explored quite thoroughly and resolved to the point wherein the finer details are now defined by a mul ti tude of court decisions. Original Law: The portion of the original 1872 statutes deal ing with assessment requirements (Sectio...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Noise {{pollution}} {{has become}} an important problem in our society. Noise <b>assessment</b> <b>regulations</b> require the measurement and evaluation of noise. The basic equipment for this measurement is the noise monitoring systems (or NMS). The current generation of NMS consists of "dumb" systems that record noise level and, possibly, noise spectra, over programmed periods of time. The interpretation of the recordings is left to a human expert acting "off-line. " The goal of our research is to develop the tools necessary to build an "intelligent" NMS able to identify automatically {{the nature of the}} sources of the noise events in addition to recording their acoustic characteristics (Figure 1). Figure 1 : "Intelligent" Noise Monitoring System. In our approach, the desired noise recognition capabilities are obtained by combining statistical pattern recognition methods with statistical signal processing techniques. The proposed statistical framework can then be used to address the pro...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the emerging "Superfund" natural resource damage assessment and compensation framework and a review of several economic and legal issues that are likely to affect the ability of the framework to achieve its objectives. The Superfund Act as amended establishes a federal regulatory structure that provides a legal "legitimization" for the use of economic-based nonmarket valuation techniques in judicial proceedings involving natural resource injuries resulting from oil and hazardous waste spills and releases. While the regulations have the potential to foster more appropriate compensation as well as prospective incentives to limit damages to natural resources, several controversial elements, definitions, and assumptions built into the damage <b>assessment</b> <b>regulations</b> appear to have the potential to undermine the efficiency and equity of damage assessments. These issues reflect the difficulty of integrating economic concepts of natural resource value and their estimation into the legal environment.
