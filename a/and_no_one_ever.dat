500|$|Suffering {{from poor}} health, Arthur made {{only a limited}} effort to secure the Republican Party's {{nomination}} in 1884; he retired {{at the close of}} his term. Journalist Alexander McClure later wrote, [...] "No man ever entered the Presidency so profoundly and widely distrusted as Chester Alan Arthur, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>ever</b> retired... more generally respected, alike by political friend and foe." [...] Although his failing health and political temperament combined to make his administration less active than a modern presidency, he earned praise among contemporaries for his solid performance in office. The New York World summed up Arthur's presidency at his death in 1886: [...] "No duty was neglected in his administration, and no adventurous project alarmed the nation." [...] Mark Twain wrote of him, [...] "t would be hard indeed to better President Arthur's administration." [...] Over the 20th and 21st centuries, however, Arthur's reputation mostly faded among the public.|$|E
500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the First World War Lipsett was dispatched to British Columbia, the Pacific coastline of which was largely undefended and was believed to be at risk from the German East Asian Cruiser Squadron under Maximilian von Spee, which had embarked on a raiding campaign in the Pacific Ocean that would culminate in the Battle of Coronel and the Battle of the Falkland Islands. Lipsett recognised that there was no immediate threat to the Canadian coast and calmed fears whilst simultaneously organising the local militia forces and deploying the two submarines purchased by provincial Premier Richard McBride. His task completed in British Columbia, Lipsett took over command and training of the 8th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. A friend recalled that as a commanding officer he was [...] "always accessible and charming in manner, yet there was that about him which made him respected <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>ever</b> presumed on his kindness, except the few old soldiers, who with their war ribbons up, and uncanny intuition, never failed to touch a soft spot in his heart." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{anniversary of}} the game was not widely commemorated until its silver anniversary in 1987. By that time, the NBA had grown to be a popular sports league with average {{attendance}} of 13,000 fans per game and star players like Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Michael Jordan. The Warriors' PR director Harvey Pollack said an impossible 40,000 people claimed to have seen the game, and some even testified it took place in Madison Square Garden. Chamberlain later stated {{it was one of}} his favorite games, but not the favorite: that title belonged to the match in which he grabbed an NBA record 55 rebounds against perennial rival Bill Russell. He did not want to feed the criticism that he was more interested in personal stardom than winning. Although Chamberlain won two NBA championships and was the NBA's all-time leading scorer and rebounder when he retired, he was mostly remembered as the man who had single-handedly scored 100 points in a game. Chamberlain publicly embraced the 100-point game in his final years. On a radio show commemorating the game's 31st anniversary in 1993, he said, [...] "As time goes by, I feel more a part of that 100-point game." [...] He explained that growing up on the streets, he would have been derisively labelled a gunner, a glory-hound, for attempting 63shots. [...] "You take that many shots on the playground, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>ever</b> wants you on their team again." [...] He said he took shots he normally would not, noting that in contests which he considered to be better he scored 50 to 60 points on around 75 percent shooting, as opposed to his 57 percent shooting in the 100-point game. He was proud that people who knew nothing about basketball would point out the game to their kids when they saw him. [...] "I know that it has been my tag. I am definitely proud of it. But it was definitely a team effort. You had {{to see some of the}} things my teammates did to get me the ball ... It was almost like a circus out there for a while." ...|$|E

"The helots {{were invited}} by a {{proclamation}} {{to pick out}} those of their number {{who claimed to have}} most distinguished themselves against the enemy, in order that they might receive their freedom; the object being to test them, as it was thought that the first to claim their freedom would be the most high spirited and the most apt to rebel. As many as two thousand were selected accordingly, who crowned themselves and went round the temples, rejoicing in their new freedom. The Spartans, however, soon afterwards did away with them, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>ever</b> knew how each of them perished." ...|$|E

2500|$|From its {{inception}} in 1930 until 2006, the Magen David Adom organization, the Israeli equivalent to the Red Cross, was not accepted {{as part of the}} Federation, as it used the Star of David, which the ICRC refused to recognize as an acceptable symbol. This meant that although Arab ambulances would be protected by the ICRC, Israeli ambulances would not. [...] In May 2000, Bernadine Healy, the president of the American Red Cross, wrote: [...] "The international committee's feared proliferation of symbols is a pitiful fig leaf, used for decades as the reason for excluding the Magen David Adom – the Shield (or Star) of David." [...] In protest over the ICRC's perceived anti-Israel discrimination, the ARC withdrew its financial support. In 2005, at a meeting of nations party to the Geneva convention, the ICRC adopted the new Red Crystal. [...] Magen David Adom then centered the Star of David sign inside the newly accepted signage, and in 2006 was accepted as a full member. Yonatan Yagodovsky, director of MDA’s fundraising department, said in an article published in October 2011 that [...] "MDA will continue to use its emblem and logo, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>ever</b> asked us to take it off." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1938, as Justice Brandeis acknowledged, [...] "the mischievous {{results of}} the {{doctrine}} had become apparent." [...] The problem with Swift was that rather than reducing forum shopping, it had only increased it by increasing the opportunities for forum shopping available to litigants. [...] There were two underlying issues behind this. [...] First, as the Erie opinion noted, nothing in the Constitution actually grants jurisdiction to the federal judiciary to conduct plenary review of issues of state common law where no federal issue is present. [...] Second, in accordance with that understanding (although this latter point was not noted in the Erie opinion), Section 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 only authorized the Supreme Court to review those state supreme court decisions that rejected federal claims. [...] While Congress broadened the scope of Supreme Court review in 1914 to include state supreme court decisions allowing federal claims, Congress never actually authorized the Supreme Court to conduct plenary review of the merits of state law claims (<b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>ever</b> sought a constitutional amendment that would authorize Congress to do that). [...] This meant the Supreme Court could not directly dictate uniform rules of state common law to all state courts or reverse their decisions for failing to apply such rules, which stands {{in stark contrast to}} other common law federations like Australia and Canada whose highest courts do possess such powers. [...] Since state courts had no actual obligation to follow the [...] "general law" [...] independently formulated under Swift by federal courts, state judge-made law continued to diverge instead of converge.|$|E
