40|$|Dendrochronology, the {{scientific}} dating method {{based on the}} analysis of tree-ring growth patterns, has been frequently <b>applied</b> in <b>climatology.</b> The basic premise of dendroclimatology is that tree rings {{can be viewed as}} climate proxies, i. e. rings are assumed to contain some hidden information about past climate. From a statistical perspective, this extraction problem can be understood as the search of a hidden variable which represents the common signal within a collection of tree-ring width series. Classical average-based techniques used in dendrochronology have been, with different degrees of success (depending on tree species, regional factors and statistical methods), applied to estimate the mean behavior of this latent variable. Still, a precise quantification of uncertainties associated to the hidden variable distribution is difficult to assess. To model the error propagation throughout the extraction procedure, we propose and study a Bayesian hierarchical model that focuses on extracting an inter-annual high frequency signal. Our method is applied to black spruce (Picea mariana) tree-rings recorded in northern Quebec and compared to a classical average-based techniques used by dendrochronologists...|$|R

40|$|The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the Earth's strongest climate {{fluctuation}} on inter-annual time-scales and has global impacts although {{originating in}} the tropical Pacific. Many point indices {{have been developed to}} describe ENSO but the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) is considered the most representative since it links six different meteorological parameters measured over the tropical Pacific. Extreme values of MEI are correlated to the extreme values of atmospheric CO 2 concentration rate variations and negatively correlated to equivalent scale extreme values of the length of day (LOD) rate variation. We evaluate a first order conversion function between MEI and the other two indexes using their annual rate of variation. The quantification of the strength of the coupling herein evaluated provides a quantitative measure to test the accuracy of theoretical model predictions. Our results further confirm the idea that the major local and global Earth-atmosphere system mechanisms are significantly coupled and synchronized to each other at multiple scales.

40|$|Human biometeorological {{approaches}} {{have an important}} role in <b>applied</b> urban <b>climatology.</b> Several different thermal indices were developed in the last decades to describe the heat stress of the human body and the energy fluxes between the body and environment. In this study some results of recent biometeorological investigations in a South-Hungarian city, Szeged (population 160, 000) are presented. From point of view of human biometeorology, the key question is whether the examined body is in the shade or is exposed to direct radiation. Our sample area is in a heavily built-up city centre region with narrow streets and several 20 - 30 year old (20 - 30 m tall) trees, so radiation fluxes are determined basically by these factors. This paper shows how the bioclimatic indices, Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) depend on the situation of radiation at a certain place. It was examined what is the relation between the structure and possible changes of the built-up area and the indices. All the calculations, Tmrt, PMV and PET were performed with RayMan model.

40|$|International audienceDendrochronology (i. e., {{the study}} of {{annually}} dated tree-ring time series) {{has proved to be}} a powerful technique to understand tree-growth. This paper intends to show the interest of using ecophysiological modeling not only to understand and predict tree-growth (dendroecology) but also to reconstruct past climates (dendroclimatology). Process models have been used for several decades in dendroclimatology, but it is only recently that methods of model-data fusion have led to significant progress in modeling tree-growth as a function of climate and in reconstructing past climates. These model-data fusion (MDF) methods, mainly based on the Bayesian paradigm, have been shown to be powerful for both model calibration and model inversion. After a rapid survey of tree-growth modeling, we illustrate MDF with examples based on series of Southern France Aleppo pines and Central France oaks. These examples show that if plants experienced CO 2 fertilization, this would have a significant effect on tree-growth which in turn would bias the climate reconstructions. This bias could be extended to other environmental non-climatic factors directly or indirectly affecting annual ring formation and not taken into account in classical empirical models, which supports the use of more complex process-based models. Finally, we conclude by showing the interest of the data assimilation methods <b>applied</b> in <b>climatology</b> to produce climate re-analyses...|$|R
5|$|In the UK {{there were}} 124 {{separate}} occasions from 2008 to 2010 when the nation's wind output fell {{to less than}} 2% of installed capacity. A report on Denmark's wind power noted that their wind power network provided less than 1% of average demand on 54 days during the year 2002. Wind power advocates argue that these periods of low wind {{can be dealt with}} by simply restarting existing power stations that have been held in readiness, or interlinking with HVDC. Electrical grids with slow-responding thermal power plants and without ties to networks with hydroelectric generation may have to limit the use of wind power. According to a 2007 Stanford University study published in the Journal of <b>Applied</b> Meteorology and <b>Climatology,</b> interconnecting ten or more wind farms can allow an average of 33% of the total energy produced (i.e. about 8% of total nameplate capacity) to be used as reliable, baseload electric power which can be relied on to handle peak loads, as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height.|$|R
40|$|We have {{performed}} simulations using a 3 -D global chemistry-transport model {{to investigate the}} influence that biogenic emissions from the African continent exert on {{the composition of the}} tropopause in the tropical region. For this purpose we have applied two recently developed biogenic emission inventories provided for use in large-scale global models (Granier et al., 2005; Lathiére et al., 2006) whose seasonality and temporal distribution for isoprene, biogenic NO and biogenic volatile organic compounds is markedly different. The use of the climatological values for biogenic emissions provided by Lathiére et al. (2006) results in an increase in the amount of nitrogen sequestrated into longer lived reservoir compounds which contributes to the reduction in tropospheric ozone burden in the tropics. The associated re-partitioning of nitrogen between PAN, HNO 3 and organic nitrates also results in a ~ 5 % increase in the loss of nitrogen by wet deposition. At a global scale there is a reduction in the oxidizing capacity of the model atmosphere which increases the atmospheric lifetimes of CH 4 and CO by ~ 1. 5 % and ~ 4 %, respectively. By the use of sensitivity studies we show that the release of NO from soils in Africa accounts for between ~ 5 – 45 % of tropospheric ozone in the African troposphere, ~ 10 % in the upper troposphere and between ~ 5 – 20 % of the tropical tropospheric ozone column over the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The subsequent reduction in OH over the source regions allows enhanced transport of CO out of the region. For biogenic volatile organic C 1 to C 3 species released from Africa the effects on tropical tropospheric ozone are rather limited, although this source contributes to the global burden of VOC by between ~ 2 – 4 % and has a large influence on the organic composition of the troposphere over the tropical Atlantic Ocean.
