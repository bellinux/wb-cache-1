5|$|At the election, Labour lost 91 {{seats in}} the House of Commons, but the Conservatives failed to achieve an overall majority, {{resulting}} in the first hung parliament since 1974. Under the constitution governing {{what happens in the}} event of a hung parliament, Brown remained temporarily <b>as</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister, while the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives entered into talks aimed at forming a coalition government. Talks between the Liberal Democrats and Labour also took place. On 10 May, Brown announced his intention to resign as leader of the Labour Party and instructed the party to initiate the election of a new leader. Brown's continued presence <b>as</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister was seen an obstacle to the negotiation of a Labour-Liberal Democrat deal. By 11 May, the possibility of a deal was becoming less likely as talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats continued. After a telephone conversation with his predecessor Tony Blair where Blair informed Brown that the election had shown that the British voters had lost faith in both him and the Labour Party and that the United Kingdom would not accept him continuing <b>as</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister. With this he concluded that he would not be able to form a government, Brown announced his resignation <b>as</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister. He also resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect. Brown was succeeded <b>as</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister by David Cameron, while Harriet Harman became acting leader of the Labour Party.|$|E

40|$|Twenty-three {{schizophrenia}} {{subjects were}} compared with healthy and clinical control subjects on an emo-tional priming task. Positive and negative emotional facial expressions were presented <b>as</b> <b>primes,</b> followed by a neutral pattern mask, then an emotionally neu-tral face as target. The prime-mask-target sequence was arranged to allow conscious perception of only the targets. Subjects had to judge if they had seen a pleas-ant or an unpleasant facial expression. All subjects judged the neutral target as significantly more unpleasant when negative emotional facial expressions were presented <b>as</b> <b>primes</b> <b>as</b> compared with positive or neutral facial expressions <b>as</b> <b>primes.</b> This judgment shift was significantly stronger in schizophrenia sub-jects than in control subjects. The stronger priming of schizophrenia subjects may reflect a stronger influence of automatically processed emotional stimuli on judg-ments. We suggest that increased spreading activation of emotional information {{might be related to}} low social/emotional functioning of the individual with schizophrenia...|$|R

5|$|After {{just over}} a year in office, Cook was forced to call a new election, the first double dissolution. Labor won back its {{majority}} in the House, and Fisher returned for a third term <b>as</b> <b>prime</b> minister. He struggled with the demands of Australia's participation in World War I, and in October 1915 resigned in favour of Billy Hughes. Fisher subsequently accepted an appointment as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, holding that position from 1916 to 1920. After a brief return to Australia, he retired to London, dying there at the age of 66. In total, Fisher served <b>as</b> <b>prime</b> minister for just under five years; Bob Hawke is {{the only member of the}} Labor Party to have served for longer.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the gradual}} {{evolution}} of the post of Prime Minister, the title is applied to early Prime Ministers only retrospectively; this has sometimes given rise to academic dispute. Lord Bath and Lord Waldegrave are both sometimes listed <b>as</b> <b>prime</b> ministers. Bath was invited to form a ministry by King George II when Henry Pelham resigned in 1746, as was Waldegrave in 1757 after the dismissal of William Pitt the Elder, who dominated the government during the Seven Years' War. Neither was able to command sufficient parliamentary support to form a government; Bath stepped down after two days, and Waldegrave after three. Modern academic consensus does not consider either man to have held office <b>as</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister, {{and they are not}} listed.|$|E

Fisher's second government passed wide-ranging reforms – it established old-age and disability pensions, enshrined new workers' rights in legislation, established the Commonwealth Bank, oversaw the continued expansion of the Royal Australian Navy, began construction on the Trans-Australian Railway, and formally established what is now the Australian Capital Territory. At the 1913 election, however, Labor narrowly lost its House of Representatives majority to the Liberal Party, with Fisher being replaced <b>as</b> <b>prime</b> minister by Joseph Cook.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study {{sought to}} test the often-taken-granted {{assumption}} about the causal relationship between the aesthetic quality of products and user affect by using affective priming paradigm. The results showed that when beautiful web-pages were used <b>as</b> <b>primes,</b> {{the discrepancy between the}} response latencies to positive target and negative targets was larger than when the primes were ugly-webpage. A parallel pattern was obtained when pleasant pictures and unpleasant pictures were used <b>as</b> <b>primes.</b> Such findings supported the hypothesis that visual Gestalt of products can lead to affective change independent of reflective beauty judgment. The possibility of employing affective priming procedure to measure product beauty is also discussed {{in the light of the}} experiment results...|$|R

40|$|Masked stimuli {{presented}} {{near the}} threshold of conscious awareness may act <b>as</b> <b>primes,</b> affecting responses to sub-sequent targets.

The present article provides evidence that the second wave is related to mask presentation and reflects inhibitory processing independent of reductions in prime visibility, even being evoked by nonmasking distractors that leave the prime fully accessible for consciousness. Of all hypotheses put forward to account for inverse effects inmasked priming, this finding is most compatible with the mask-triggered inhibition hypothesis suggested by P. Jaśkowski (2007) ...|$|R
