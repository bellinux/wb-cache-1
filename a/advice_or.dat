5|$|Friends and comrades, {{the light}} {{has gone out}} of our lives, and there is {{darkness}} everywhere, and I do not quite know what to tell you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for <b>advice</b> <b>or</b> seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, {{during his}} first days in office, Bluehouse's successor, Kelsey A. Begaye, {{received}} more complaints and letters protesting the zoo's closure than concerning any other political issue. After temporarily reversing Bluehouse's decision, Begaye then summoned {{a meeting with the}} Navajo Nation's Hataałii Advisory Council to discuss the situation; the group, however, refused to consider the matter while the animals were in hibernation and postponed any <b>advice</b> <b>or</b> decision until April of the following year. Options under consideration were releasing the animals into the wild, not accepting new animals and closing the zoo after the last one had died, or renaming the zoo to a term that would be considered more respectful to the animals.|$|E
5|$|The {{jurisdiction}} of the Charity Commission is concurrent {{with that of the}} High Court of Justice. The High Court possesses all the powers of the Commission, who only exercise theirs on application of the charity or Attorney General, or trustees, beneficiaries and interested people when the charity has an income of less than £500. The Commission, under Section 29 of the 2011 Act, also keeps the register of charities. Under Section 110 of the Act, the Commission is tasked with giving <b>advice</b> <b>or</b> opinions to trustees relating to the performance or administration of their charity. The Commission also acts as the Official Custodian for Charities, who acts as a trustee for charities at the direction of the Commission.|$|E

5|$|Wilberforce was {{generous with}} {{his time and}} money, believing that those with wealth had a duty to give a {{significant}} portion of their income to the needy. Yearly, he gave away thousands of pounds, much of it to clergymen to distribute in their parishes. He paid off the debts of others, supported education and missions, and in a year of food shortages, gave to charity more than his own yearly income. He was exceptionally hospitable, and could not bear to sack any of his servants. As a result, his home was full of old and incompetent servants kept on in charity. Although he was often months behind in his correspondence, Wilberforce responded to numerous requests for <b>advice</b> <b>or</b> for help in obtaining professorships, military promotions and livings for clergymen, or for the reprieve of death sentences.|$|E

25|$|Benzodiazepines are {{regarded}} as a highly addictive drug class. A psychological and physical dependence can develop in as short as a few weeks but may take years to develop in other individuals. Patients wanting to withdraw from benzodiazepines typically receive little <b>advice</b> <b>or</b> support, and such withdrawal should be by small increments {{over a period of}} months.|$|E
25|$|This {{argument}} is disputed {{in other parts}} of the world. For example, in the state of Louisiana, giving <b>advice</b> <b>or</b> supplying the means to end a person’s life is considered a criminal act and can be charged as a felony. In state courts this crime is comparable to manslaughter. The same laws apply in the states of Mississippi and Nebraska.|$|E

Allegations against the hospital were directed at the examining nurse who allegedly fabricated statements concerning the initial medical examination, her supervisor (who adopted those statements even though they were contrary to the examination), and the failure of the Hospital to supervise these employees.|$|E
25|$|Usually, the bowler {{decides what}} type of {{delivery}} to bowl next, without consultation or even informing any other member of his team. Sometimes, the team captain will offer <b>advice</b> <b>or</b> even issue a direct order regarding what deliveries to bowl, based on his observations of the batsman and the strategic state of the game. Another player who occasionally offers advice to the bowler is the wicket-keeper, since he has a unique view of the batsman and {{may be able to}} spot weaknesses of technique.|$|E

They often wondered how a non-Brahmin could master such profound knowledge of Hinduism. His thirst for knowledge and his ascetic habits ‘made his contemporaries acknowledge him as the most formidable intellectual in the Durbar,’ formed by the group of ascetics in the New Dispensation after Keshub Chunder Sen’s death.|$|E

The roles of the state executive {{are similar to those}} of the National Executive but specialised to the state with a closer relationship to local churches. The state executives recommend to the National Executive eligible candidates for ordination. They provide assistance to churches requesting <b>advice</b> <b>or</b> intervention and also have the authority to discipline ministers.

25|$|People could {{complete}} and submit their questionnaire online, or fill it in {{on paper and}} post it back in a pre-addressed envelope. Guidance was provided online and through the census helpline. Completed questionnaires were electronically tracked and field staff followed up with households that did not return a questionnaire. Special arrangements were made to count people living in communal establishments such as; boarding schools, prisons, military bases, hospitals, care homes, student halls of residence, hotels, royal apartments and embassies, {{as well as for}} particular communities; rough sleepers, travellers and those living on waterways. In these cases field staff delivered and collected questionnaires and, where needed, provided <b>advice</b> <b>or</b> assistance in completing the questionnaire.|$|E
25|$|Douglas' father, the Marquess of Queensberry (Tom Wilkinson), {{objects to}} his son's {{relationship}} with Wilde and demeans the playwright {{shortly after the}} opening of The Importance of Being Earnest. When Wilde sues the Marquess for criminal libel against him, his homosexuality is publicly exposed; he is eventually tried for gross indecency and sentenced to two years' hard labour. In prison, he is visited by his wife, who tells him she is not divorcing him but is taking their sons to Germany {{and that he is}} welcome to visit as long as he never sees Douglas again. Wilde is released from prison and goes straight into exile to continental Europe. In spite of the <b>advice</b> <b>or</b> objections of others, he eventually meets with Douglas.|$|E
30|$|Nine out {{of twenty}} of the {{included}} studies used {{some form of}} gait retraining <b>or</b> <b>advice</b> {{as part of the}} MFW transition. The training <b>or</b> <b>advice</b> included some <b>or</b> all of the following: a more upright posture with hips forward, increased cadence (+[*] 10 %), running “lightly and quietly”, and adopting a non-rearfoot strike pattern. One study [29] included the above gait retraining but provided no instruction on foot strike. Two studies [26, 28] provided recommendations but no direct feedback, and one study [9] informed the participants that changes happen but told them not to be compelled to make any changes. Most studies implemented gait retraining <b>or</b> <b>advice</b> through a deliberate instruction at pre-tests.
