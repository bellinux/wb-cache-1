[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2014 Bu tez çalışması, Ankara ili Çubuk ilçesinin doğu ve kuzeydoğusunda yer alan Susuz, Kuyumcu, Bodurlar, Camili köylerinde ve çevresinde yataklanan agatların jeokimyasal ve mineralojik-petrografik özelliklerini kapsamaktadır. Andezitik ve riyolitik birimlerde kanal dolgusu olarak gelişen ayrıca kendine özgü çubuksu kristalleri bulunan çubuk agatları volkanik istif içinde geneldedağınık ve düzensiz nodüller halinde yataklanmış olup, bölgede makroskobik özelliklerine gore farklı tiplerde agat belirlenmiştir. Belirlenen agatlar türlerinin isimleri Çubuk/Tüp agat, Yıldız agat, Thunder egg agat, Amigloidal (bademsi) agat, Uruguay tipi agat, Brazilya tipi agat olarak verilmiştir. Çatlak sistemleri içerisinde görülen agatların kalınlıkları 1 mm. ’den 20 cm. kalınlığına kadar, bağımsız nodüllerin büyüklükleri ise 5 cm. - 30 cm. arasında değişmektedir.   İncelenmek üzere çalışma alanından ana kayaç ve agatlardan sistematik bir şekilde örnekler alınmıştır. Alınan bu örnekler uygulanacak analiz türüne gore numune hazırlama işlemlerinde geçmiştir. İnce kesit, asitte çözme ve pellet gibi işlemler uygulanarak numuneler analizlere hazırlanmıştır. Yapılan optik-mineralojik analiz sonuçlarına gore, agatlarda ve bulundukları ana kayaçlarda incelemeler yapılarak tipik agat gelişimi görülmekte olup ana kayaçlarda feldispat, plajiyoklas, kuvars, biyotit ve opak mineraller, agat oluşumlarında opal-CT, kalsedon ve kuvars tespit edilmiştir.   Taramalı elektron mikroskop analiz sonuçlarına göre; agatların farklı SiO 2 bantlarından oluştukları belirlenmeye çalışılmıştır. XRD (X-ışınları Difraktometresi) analizi ile agatların mineral bileşimleri tespit edilmiştir. Jeokimyasal incelemelerle XRF (X-ışınları Fluoresansı) analizleri ile tüm kayaç analizleri yapılarak volkanik birimlerin major oksit, iz ve nadir toprak elementleri içerikleri belirlenmiştir. Ana kayaçlarda jeokimyasal sonuçların birbirleriyle uyumlu olduğuve böylece aynı kökene sahip oldukları görüşü ortaya çıkmıştır. 13 adet farklı renklerdeagat bantları ayrılmış. Bu bantlarınICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma – Mass Spectrometer) analiz sonuçlarına göre iz ve nadir toprak elementleri değişimleri ve dağılımları saptanmıştır. Bantlara göre farklı element dağılımları gözlenmiştir. Sıvı kapanım çalışmaları kapsamında incelemeler yapılmış, fakat hazırlanan kesitlerde sıvı kapanım oluşumları tespit edilememiştir. Sahada ekonomik olarak düzenli bir agat üretimi yapılmamaktadır. Fakat yöre halkı tarafından araziden toplanarak engelli vatandaşlar içim kurulan küçük atölyelerde işlenmekte ve ekonomiye kazandırılmaktadır. This study {{comprises}} {{the determination of}} the geochemical and mineralogical-petrographicalcharacteristicsof agates deposited aroundSusuz, Kuyumcu, Bodurlar and Camili villages that are locatedto the northeastern and east part of the Çubuk district (Ankara). Agates have been used since the Chalcolithic period andhave come up today by not losing its significance. Alsothey have become more important gemstones for scientific envirenmet due to they could not be produced in the laboratory. They are typical with having significantly different color from each other and  matte layer, with banded or striped appearance. These different layers and transparency of the colors are similar banded appearance may be less obvious, although typical agate, always sharply contrasting colors indicate bands. In this study, geochemical evaluation and characteristics of the causes of bands with different colors of agate coloration was targeted. This region has volcanic characterictics and lots of types of agates that are known by all world. Bu agates in the field are not producedregularly and economically. An important part of our country run gem isgemstones with SiO 2 composition (quartz belongs to a group). This gem of the bedding area where mostly concentrated in the west of Turkey but also in areas of volcanic activity are observed. The most common and gem quality material in these units are agates. Ankara-Çubuk region is the basin of aa compression. In eastern and western parts of the region are a major fault. Also available in small faults in the region and they are most likely formed by the influence of regional volcanism. Agate is disordered in the study area and are free. Volcanic units dissociate from the liberalization of the natural ways of the agate is processed in small workshops convened by the locals. First of all, literature was searched and methods were determined in this study. Hoverwer, in our country, it is observed that there are limited studies about agates. After searching literature, the investigation field was visited and the samples for analyzingwere collected systematically. All samples were prepared according to analysis methods. For optical mineralogical and fluid inclusion investigation, thin sections were prepared properly. In addition, all samples were grinded until 40 micron. For geochemical analysises, the samples were solved within hydrochloric acite, nitric acid, hydrofluoric acid and boric acite in microwave device. Whereas the main rock samples were pressed and made pellets to analysis in X-Ray Fluorescence for identifying their major oxides.   The geochemical composition of the host rocks of the study area has been identifiedas rhyolite, according to geochemical data. Optical mineralogy studies were identified the glassy matrix and mineral distribution indicates as trakianzite. This dilemma, giving rise to volcanism and create acidic composition and crystallization of magma high content of silica matrix is the participation of non-silica materials. So it is thought that the main rock compositon shows as rhyolite. Suludere (1976), Ankara-Rod in Meşeli, Lower Orders, grandfathers vicinity geology of the working volcanic tuff, <b>acid</b> <b>lava</b> and basic lava flows as a group have also locally small-scale formation of pearlite have stated that. Agates in the study area have been seen different forms due to theirmacroscopical features. Their names are stick/tube agates, star agates, thunder egg agates, amygdaloidal agates, Uruguay (gravitational) type agates and Brazilian type agates. Some of them are formed as their combination, like Uruguay (gravitational) type and thender egg. Petronek J. (2004), found in basaltic rocks seen in agate banding, and gravitational (Uruguay type) as well as adezyonel (Brazilian type) banding, has argued that is controlled by the climate. The thickness of the agates in the veins and cracks in therock units vary from 1 mm to 20 cm whereas agates in the gas vesicles have athickness varying from 5 cm to 30 cm. The optical - mineralogical analysis based on the results agate and their host rocks making the surveys typically agate development is evident on the main rocks feldspar, plagioclase, quartz, biotite and opaque minerals, agate formation in the opal- CT (C:cristobalite and T:tridimite), chalcedony and quartz have been identified.   The study area compared to the host rocks of rhyolite composition is determined as geochemical data. Optical mineralogy studies identified the glassy matrix and with mineral distribution indicates trakianzit. This dilemma, giving rise to volcanism I create acidic composition and crystallization of magma high content of silica matrix is the participation of non-silica materials. Mineralogical composition in the bands of the agates was determined by using XRD (X-Ray Diffractometer) analysis method. Their composition is generally consist of quartz, opal-CT (C:cristobalite and T:tridimite), chalcedony. All of them are polymorphous of SiO 2. Their composition is same, on the other hand their sizes of crystals are different. Moreover, opal-CT has also H 2 O in its crystal structure. According to analysis by scanning electron microscopy; they are composed of different types of agate band was to determine SiO 2. With geochemical studies of whole rock analyzes were made by XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence) analysis of major oxides and trace element contents of volcanic units have been determined. Spider diagrams are formed with the result of these analysises. According to spider diyagrams, concentration of trace and rare earth elements in the main rock are generally compatible. So it is said that their origin is same. While some elements like Rb, Th, Ce, Pb, Y, Dy are growed rich, some elements like Nb, U, P,Eu, Ti become poor concentration. Whereas by using some volcanic rock classification diyagrams such as TAS (Middlemost   1994), Jensen (1976) and AFM plot (Irvine and Baragar 1971),the main rock were identified asarhyolites.   Whereas by using some volcanic rock classification diyagrams such as TAS (Middlemost 1994), Jensen (1976) and AFM plot (Irvine and Baragar 1971),the main rock were identified as a rhyolites. The main chemical composition of rock samples as a result of taking into consideration the diagrams used {{has been found to be}} generally rhyolite. These cases do not overlap with the optical mineralogical studies are also consistent with previous studies. According to the results of ICP - MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma – Mass Spectrometer) analysis of separated 13 different colored agate band elements in different variations and distribution were determined. Concentration of trace and rare earth elements in the agates are not compatible. Generally, Eu concentration of all samples becomes poor. Wang, Y. and Merino, E. (1995), in basalt formation of agate, chalcedony fibers and trace element geochemistry worked on bending. Also in basalts banding in agate and views on the origin of the fibrous structure, and have found that there are two mechanisms during the formation of agate have revealed. Goetz, J. (2001), agate formation and agate forming the origin of fluids collected information about the world to different eighteen locations of different ages from the very acidic, intermediate and basic volcanic received from agate samples of trace elements and stable isotope analysis has worked with. As a result of agate and associated quartz shells isotope deuterium and oxygen isotopic composition of samples of different positions and individual differences in the samples revealed agate.   Researchers, for different fluid compositions, nucleation temperatures calculated agate, consequently, from 50 ° C to 250 ° C as stated temperature scale. Gül B. (2006), Ankara-rod region of volcanic rock mineralogy, petrography and geochemistry accordingly prepared the master's thesis on the mineralogical and petrographic description Roseinecel. As a result, overall bütünvolkanik components of rock samples; plagioclase, amphibole, biotite, pyroxene and opaque minerals has indicated that. Pyroclastic rocks in his XRD studies, however, opal-CT, clinoptilolite, calcite, mica, quartz, feldspar, kaolin and clay presence was detected. Goetz, J. (1999), agate structure and luminescence behavior across the globe, specific locations, different volcanic rocks, taking agate and quartz shell samples and the Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR), katadolüminesans (CL) trace element analysis and examined. Goetz agate all the examples of the results of the research have been identified aparamanyetik centers and katadolüminesans microscopy and quartz agate shells have different internal structures and zoning studies have suggested. Fluid inclusion studies carried out within the scope views, but the formation of fluid inclusionswere not detected in the sections that were prepared. So, in the future, more samples will be prepared and searched for fluid inclusion to learn about temperature conditions of agates formation. A map of the study field was prepared by using the map of MTA (Mining Research and Exploration). Corel Draw X 6 programme was used for mapping and other geological sectional shapes of figures, and also GCDKit for the preparation of geochemical and spider diagrams was used. Yüksek LisansM.

SUMMARY The {{study is}} about Sierra Madre del Sur, has {{mountain}} belt wich lining the Pacific coast, {{parallel to the}} Acapulco Trench. It is based one geological mapping of two representative areas situated in Guerrero state (the first around Olinalà, the second near the capital Chilpancingo), and one carring out transects (scale 1 / 1). Its goal is to individualize the significant geological sets and to characterize the structures related to the various stages of deformation; this in order to reconstitute {{the evolution of the}} sierra since the Jurassic inferior, by putting it within the geodynamic framework of the southern part of Mexico currently located at the crossroads of the North America plates, Caribbean and Coconuts. The first part relates to the architecture and the history of the sierra, approached by the stratigraphic and petrographic approaches and the retrotectonic structural analysis. The Jurassic pre continental – base (part of the block of Oaxaca) includes/understands a base – born of the assembly of the "terranes" Oaxaca and Mixtèque with the Paleozoic inferior – equipped locally with his sedimentary cover of the Paleozoic superior little deformed; the Xolapa Complex which levels along the coast, is a lower part of this crust, migmatized and granitized as a root of the arcs Jurassic and the Paleogene, and recently exhumed. In the whole of the Middle Jurassic, the volcanic rocks and volcanoclastic are recognized with dominant acid (Chapolapa Formation) of an arc with which the basin back-arc with Tecocoyunca is associated. Both are tectonised and metamorphised (green schist) by the compressive Nevadien phase of the Jurassic superior. In connection with the eustatic rise, the lower Cretaceous is marked by the marine invasion and the deposit in discordance of the neritic formations with recifs formations of the thick carbonated platform of Guerrero – Morelos. It is on the "peaceful" edge of this one that is carried out, {{at the base of the}} higher Cretaceous, the haulage of the "terrane" Guerrero (intra-oceanic arc generated during the Jurassic superior and the lower Cretaceous) by collision unintermitting – arc. A major consequence of this event is the formation, with before crown, of a basin flexural in which a powerful terrigenous series (flysch Mexcala) accumulates, during the higher Cretaceous and the Paleocene one. This basin, affected by the Laramide phase, undergoes, with the Paleocene lower – Eocene superior, a strong East-West shortening, adapted by the crumpling of the separated cover and the chipping of the base. The unmatched unit, the Paleogene and lower miocene, include/understand post-Laramide continental molasses (Formation Balsas) passing laterally and vertically to the volcanic drill plate with dominant ignimbritic generated by the subduction of the old Farallon plate; it is deformed by basic folds south-eastern – southern – north-western – north of lower Miocène. Since Miocène and following the departure of the Chortis block the evolution, still in progress, Sierra Madre del Sur is under the dependence of the subduction of the Cocos plate: it is it which induces and maintains the exhumation the lower continental crust of the block of Oaxaca (between the surface of subduction and a major surface of detachment crustal in normal fault) with update of the Complex Xolapa and deformation in antiforme of the Sierra Madre del Sur, parallel to the pit of subduction of Acapulco and thus very obliquely compared to the mesozoïc and tertiary former structures recut. The second part is initially the occasion to specify, by the placement of the pétro-geochemical tool, the geodynamic environments of the genesis of two geological sets present in the Sierra Madre del Sur and which are essential markers of the evolution of the Mexican margin: the volcanic arc Chapolapa of the Middle Jurassic whose importance has, until now, been underestimated and the higher Jurassic arc volcanic – cretaceous lower of the "terrane" Guerrero. The petrographic characteristics, the geochemistry of the major elements, the geochemistry of the elements traces and the isotopic geochemistry of the generally acid volcanic rocks of the arc Chapolapa, indicate that they are connected with the calc-alkali series of an old arc of the Andean type. They derive from the fusion of a coat asthenospheric contaminated by the fluids of the hydrothermalized paleo-pacific oceanic crust, by sediments involved in the subduction and, probably, by the North-American continental crust (block of Oaxaca) on which they rest. The volcanic rocks (<b>acid</b> <b>lava</b> and andesites of the lower Cretaceous) of the "terrane" Guerrero present in this part of the Sierra Madre del Sur are also calco-alkalin. But the geochemical indicators confirm that their context of installation was that of an insular arc the intra-Pacific These results, thereafter, are integrated in the presentation, in 2 d, of an evolutionary model of the Sierra Madre del Sur This one, built, in six stages according to the calendar established in the first part, schematizes the evolution of this building, from the Jurassic one to the current one. In the third part and on the basis of library search, a synthesis is carried out on the Jurassic components present, as in the Sierra Madre del Sur, with before "terrane" Guerrero on the old edge of the North-American continent. By finding characteristics petrologic, geochemical, stratigraphic and structural comparable, the presence of an old preliminary Nevadien chain is highlighted, from California to Honduras, even if its shifted initial continuity at summer in a sinistral way and on several hundred kilometers by transforming faults, on the one hand in the north of Mexico to the lower Jurassic – superior Crétacé, on the other hand in the south of Mexico and Guatemala since the Paleogene. This essential data is integrated in a model of palinspathic evolution of Mexico, presented since the Jurassic one in six charts. L'étude concerne la Sierra Madre del Sur, chaîne montagneuse qui borde la côte pacifique parallèlement à la fosse de subduction d'Acapulco. Elle est fondée sur la cartographie géologique de deux secteurs représentatifs situés dans l'Etat de Guerrero (l'un autour d'Olinalá, l'autre aux environs de la capitale Chilpancingo) et sur la réalisation de coupes à l'échelle 1 / 1. Son but est d'individualiser les ensembles géologiques significatifs et de caractériser les structures liées aux diverses étapes de déformation; ceci afin de reconstituer l'évolution de la sierra depuis le Jurassique inférieur, en la replaçant dans le cadre géodynamique de la partie sud du Mexique située actuellement au carrefour des plaques Amérique du Nord, Caraïbe et Cocos. La première partie concerne l'architecture et l'histoire de la sierra, abordées par les approches stratigraphiques et pétrographiques et par l'analyse structurale rétrotectonique. Le soubassement continental pré – jurassique (partie du bloc d'Oaxaca) comprend un socle – né de l'assemblage des « terranes » Oaxaca et Mixtèque au Paléozoïque inférieur – pourvu localement de sa couverture sédimentaire du Paléozoïque supérieur peu déformée; le Complexe Xolapa qui affleure le long de la côte, est une partie inférieure de cette croûte, migmatisée et granitisée en tant que racine des arcs jurassique et paléogène, et exhumée récemment. Dans l'ensemble du Jurassique moyen, sont reconnues les roches volcaniques et volcanoclastiques à dominante acide (Formation Chapolapa) d'un arc auquel est associé le bassin arrière-arc de Tecocoyunca. Les deux sont tectonisés et métamorphisés (schiste vert) par la phase compressive névadienne du Jurassique supérieur. En liaison avec la montée eustatique, le Crétacé inférieur est marqué par la transgression marine et le dépôt en discordance des formations néritiques à récifales de l'épaisse plate-forme carbonatée de Guerrero – Morelos. C'est sur le bord « pacifique » de celle-ci que s'effectue, à la base du Crétacé supérieur, le charriage du « terrane » Guerrero (arc intra-océanique engendré durant le Jurassique supérieur et le Crétacé inférieur) par collision arc – continent. Une conséquence majeure de cet événement est la formation, à l'avant du front de charriage, d'un bassin flexural dans lequel une puissante série terrigène (flysch Mexcala) s'accumule, durant le Crétacé supérieur et le Paléocène. Ce bassin, affecté par la phase laramienne, subit, au Paléocène supérieur – Eocène inférieur, un fort raccourcissement est-ouest, accomodé par le plissement de la couverture décollée et par l'écaillage du socle. L'ensemble discordant, paléogène et miocène inférieur, comprend des molasses continentales post-laramiennes (Formation Balsas) passant latéralement et verticalement au plastron volcanique à dominante ignimbritique engendré par la subduction de l'ancienne plaque Farallon; il est déformé par des plis de fond nord – nord-ouest – sud – sud-est du Miocène inférieur. Depuis le Miocène et suite au départ du bloc Chortis l'évolution, encore en cours, de la Sierra Madre del Sur est sous la dépendance de la subduction de la plaque Cocos : c'est elle qui induit et entretient l'exhumation de la croûte continentale inférieure du bloc d'Oaxaca (entre la surface de subduction et une surface majeure de détachement crustale en faille normale) avec mise à jour du Complexe de Xolapa et déformation en antiforme de la Sierra Madre del Sur, parallèlement à la fosse de subduction d'Acapulco et donc très obliquement par rapport aux structures antérieures mésozoïques et tertiaires recoupées. La deuxième partie est d'abord l'occasion de préciser, par la mise en œuvre de l'outil pétro-géochimique, les environnements géodynamiques de la genèse de deux ensembles géologiques présents dans la Sierra Madre del Sur et qui sont des marqueurs essentiels de l'évolution de la marge mexicaine: l'arc volcanique Chapolapa du Jurassique moyen dont l'importance a, jusqu'à présent, été mésestimée et l'arc volcanique jurassique supérieur – crétacé inférieur du « terrane » Guerrero. Les caractéristiques pétrographiques, la géochimie des éléments majeurs, la géochimie des éléments traces et la géochimie isotopique des roches volcaniques généralement acides de l'arc Chapolapa, indiquent qu'elles s'apparentent aux séries calco-alcalines d'un ancien arc de type andin. Elles dérivent de la fusion d'un manteau asthénosphérique contaminé par les fluides de la croûte océanique paléo-pacifique hydrothermalisée, par des sédiments entraînés dans la subduction et, vraisemblablement, par la croûte continentale nord-américaine (bloc d'Oaxaca) sur laquelle elles reposent Les roches volcaniques (laves acides et andésites du Crétacé inférieur) du « terrane » Guerrero présent dans cette partie de la Sierra Madre del Sur sont également calco-alcalines. Mais les indicateurs géochimiques confirment que leur contexte de mise en place était celui d'un arc insulaire intra-Pacifique Ces résultats sont, par la suite, intégrés dans la présentation, en 2 D, d'un modèle évolutif de la Sierra Madre del Sur. Celui-ci, construit, en six étapes selon le calendrier établi dans la première partie, schématise l'évolution de cet édifice, depuis le Jurassique jusqu'à l'actuel. Dans la troisième partie et sur la base d'une recherche bibliographique, une synthèse est réalisée sur les constituants jurassiques présents, comme dans la Sierra Madre del Sur, à l'avant du « terrane » Guerrero sur l'ancien bord du continent nord-américain. En retrouvant des caractéristiques pétrologiques, géochimiques, stratigraphiques et structurales comparables, la présence d'une ancienne chaîne liminaire névadienne est mise en évidence, depuis la Californie jusqu'au Honduras, même si sa continuité initiale à été décalée de façon sénestre et sur plusieurs centaines de kilomètres par des failles transformantes, d'une part dans le nord du Mexique au Jurassique supérieur – Crétacé inférieur, d'autre part au sud du Mexique et au Guatemala depuis le Paléogène. Cette donnée essentielle est intégrée dans un modèle d'évolution palinspathique du Mexique, présenté depuis le Jurassique en six cartes...|$|E
40|$|The oldest rocks {{exposed in}} the area are {{quartzites}} and schists of the Dove Group which underwent considerable deformation during the Precambrian. Upper (?) Cambrian <b>acid</b> <b>lavas,</b> volcanics, greywackes, cherts, siltstones and quartzites comprise the Bull Creek Volcanics and the Lorinna Volcanics. These rocks were formed in an easterly extension of the Dundas Trough, north of the Tyennan Block. The Dove Granodiorite intruded these rocks along the southern margin of the Trough in Late Jukesian (?) times. The petrology of the Cambrian rocks is discussed in some detail and it is concluded that the <b>acid</b> <b>lavas</b> were derived from the same magma as the Dove Granodiorite. Ordovician rocks in this area consist of the Roland Conglomerate at the base, which is conformably overlain by the Moina Sandstone and the Gordon Limestone in turn. During the Tabberabberan Orogeny, these rocks were folded and faulted into northwesterly trending structures. The Dolcoath Granite intruded late in the Tabberabberan Orogeny causing some metamorphism of the country rocks. It is suggested the granite intruded as a northerly dipping, roughly tabular body. There may be a small cupola in the Stormont area. The majority of the mineral deposits in this area are genetically related to the Dolcoath Granite. A fairly distinct zone of wolframcassiterite deposits surrounds {{the northern part of the}} granite. Around this, is a zone of auriferous sulphides. The mineralogy of these two zones is described. Areas most likely to prove of economic importance are indicated together with suggested sites for a preliminary diamond-drilling programme. ...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY. Alkalic rhyolites with {{peralkaline}} affinities, bearing quartz and potassic feldspar pheno-crysts, {{are described}} from Iceland {{for the first}} time. Evidence from electron-probe analyses of feldspar phenocrysts indicates crystallization {{in or near the}} thermal valley of the system SiO 2 -Or-Ab. Icelandic acid volcanic rocks are subdivided into alkalic rhyolites, belonging to transitional nd alkalic basalt lineages, and the mildly calc-alkaline rhyolites of tholeiite lineages. PUBLISHED chemical and mineralogical data on some acid rocks from eastern Iceland have provided good documentation f a suite of acid volcanic rocks typified by a high silica/alkalis ratio (greater than 9), an affinity with calc-alkaline acid rocks, and the presence of plagioclase phenocrysts as the salic, and often the only pheno-cryst phase (Carmichael, 1962, 1963). Their association with tholeiitic basalt lavas has been pointed out by Carmichael (I 963) who suggested that these one-feldspar rhyolites were typical products of the fractionation of a tholeiitic magma. For some time now, these rhyolites have come to be regarded as the typical Icelandic acid magma, but the discovery of alkalic <b>acid</b> <b>lavas</b> in western and southern Iceland has shown the compositional range of Icelandic acid volcanics to be much greater tha...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. Chemical nalyses of the Lorne {{volcanic}} rocks {{show that}} the basalts and andesites are a closely related suite of lavas, notably rich in alkalis, especially potassium. The rhyolites of the Lorne area {{do not appear to}} form a continuous series with the more basic rocks. The various lava types are compared with the plutonic rocks of the area, and a relationship s suggested between the basic lavas and appinitic intrusions. The <b>acid</b> <b>lavas</b> are not comparable togranites inthe area. The late orogenic gneous activity {{in this part of the}} Caledonides therefore appears to involve three generations of magma, produced separately but within a short ime of one another. The assumption that all the late Caledonian igneous rocks of the Scottish Highlands are differentiates of a common parent magma isnot justified. THE DEVONIAN lavas of the west of Scotland are an example of the volcanic associa-tion described by Turner and Verhoogen (I 96 O) as the basalt-andesite-rhyolite association of orogenic regions. They show a close temporal and spatial relationship to a wide variety of acid and basic, plutonic and hypabyssal igneous rocks, all of which were produced uring the latest stages of the Caledonian orogeny. The purpose of this study was to ascertain from chemical evidence whether the Caledonian igneous rock...|$|R
40|$|The paper reports newly {{obtained}} stratigraphic, petrographic, and {{isotope geochronology}} data on modern moderately <b>acid</b> <b>lavas</b> from the Keli Highland of the Greater Caucasus and presents a geological {{map of the}} territory, in which 35 volcanoes active in Late Quaternary time were documented by the authors. Total duration of volcanic activity at the highland was estimated at 250 ka. Volcanic activity was discrete and occurred in three phases: Middle Neopleistocene (245 - 170 ka), Late Neopleistocene (135 - 70 ka), and Late Neopleistocene-Holocene (< 30 ka). Newly obtained lines of evidence indicate that certain volcanoes erupted in the latest Neopleistocene-Holocene. The first phase of volcanic activity was connected mainly with lava volcanoes, and eruptions during the later phases of volcanic activity {{in this part of}} the Greater Caucasus produced mainly lavas. The most significant eruptions are demonstrated to occur in the territory during the second phase. The major evolutionary trends of volcanic processes during the final phase in the Keli Highland are determined. It was also determined that overwhelming majority of volcanoes that were active less than 30 ka BP are spatially restricted to long-liven local magmatic zones, which were active during either all three or only the final two phases of activity.

50|$|Much {{discussion}} {{has taken place}} regarding the origin of these spheroids, but it is generally admitted {{that most of them}} were originally spherulites, and that they have suffered extensive changes through decomposition and silicification. Many of the older quartz-porphyries that occur in Paleozoic and Pre-Cambrian rocks have been affected by earth movements, and have experienced crushing and shearing. In this way they become schistose, and from their feldspar minute plates of sericitic white mica are developed, giving the rock in some cases very much of the appearance of mica-schists. If there have been no phenocrysts in the original rock, very perfect mica-schists may be produced, which can hardly be distinguished from sedimentary schists, though chemically somewhat different on account of the larger amounts of alkalis igneous rocks contain. When phenocrysts were present they often remain, though rounded and dragged apart while the matrix flows around them. The glassy or felsitic enclosures in the quartz are then very suggestive of an igneous origin for the rock. Such porphyry-schists have been called porphyroids or porphyroid-schists, and in the United States the name aporhyolite has been used for them. They are well known {{in some parts of the}} Alps, Westphalia, Charnwood (England), and Pennsylvania. The halleflintas of Sweden are also in part acid igneous rocks with a well-banded schistose or granulitic texture. The quartz-porphyries are distinguished from the rhyolites by being either intrusive rocks or Palaeozoic <b>lavas.</b> All Tertiary <b>acid</b> <b>lavas</b> are included under rhyolites. The intrusive quartz-porphyries are equally well described as granite-porphyries.|$|R

50|$|A second mode of {{occurrence}} of tachylite {{is in the}} form of lava flows. Basaltic rocks often contain a small amount of glassy ground-mass, and in the limburgites this becomes more important and conspicuous, but vitreous types are far less common in these than in the <b>acid</b> <b>lavas.</b> In the Hawaiian Islands, however, the volcanoes have poured out vast floods of black basalt, containing feldspar, augite, olivine, and iron ores in a black glassy base. They are highly liquid when discharged, and the rapid cooling that ensues on their emergence to the air prevents crystallization taking place completely. Many of them are spongy or vesicular, and their upper surfaces are often exceedingly rough and jagged, while at other times they assume rounded wave-like forms on solidification. Great caves are found where the crust has solidified and the liquid interior has subsequently flowed away, and stalactites and stalagmites of black tachylite adorn the roofs and floors. On section these growths show usually a central cavity enclosed by walls of dark brown glass in which skeletons and microliths of augite, olivine and feldspar lie imbedded. From the crater of Mt. Kilauea, thin clouds of steam rise constantly, and as the bubbles of vapor are liberated from the molten rock they carry into the air with them thin fibers of basalt that solidify at once and assume the form of tachylite threads. Under the microscope they prove to be nearly completely glassy with small circular air vesicles sometimes drawn out to long tubes. Only in the Hawaiian Islands are glassy basaltic lavas of this kind at all common. A small outcrop at Spring Hill in Victoria, Australia has tachylite which has been exploited as a material for making Aboriginal flaked stone implements.|$|R
40|$|New {{data are}} {{reported}} on structure of sections, chemical composition, {{and age of}} volcano-sedimentary and volcanic rocks from the Sinii Utes Depression in the Southern Primorye region. The Sinii Utes Depression is filled with two sequences: the lower sequence composed of sedimentary-volcanogenic coaliferous rocks (the stratotype of the Sinii Utes Formation) and the upper sequence consisting of tephroid with overlying basalts. This work considers chemical composition and problems of K-Ar dating of basalts. The uppermost basaltic flow has K-Ar age 22. 0 ± 1. 0 Ma. The dates obtained for {{the middle and upper}} parts of lava flows are underestimated. It is explained by their heating due to combustion of brown coals of the Sinii Utes Formation underlying the lava flow. Calculations show that argon could only partly have been removed from the basalts owing to conductive heat transfer and was lost largely due to infiltration of hot gases in heterogeneous fissured medium. Basaltic volcanism on continental margins of the southern Primorye region and the adjacent Korean and Chinese areas at the Oligocene-Miocene boundary preceded Early-Middle Miocene spreading and formation of the Sea of Japan basin. Undifferentiated moderately alkaline basalts of intraplate affinity developed in the Amba Depression and some other structures of the southern Primorye region and intraplate alkali basalts of the Phohang Graben in the Korean Peninsula serve as indicators of incipient spreading regime in the Sea of Japan. Potassic basalt-trachybasalt eruptions occurred locally in riftogenic depressions and shield volcanoes. In some structures this volcanism was terminated by eruptions of intermediate and <b>acid</b> <b>lavas.</b> Such evolution of volcanism is explained by selective contamination of basaltic melts during their interaction with crustal acid material and generation of acid anatectic melts...|$|R
40|$|The lavas and {{pyroclastics}} of Ascension Island {{contain a}} suite of coarse grained igneous blocks which range in composition from olivine-gabbro to peralkaline-granite paralleling, but extending beyond the compositional range of the volcanics. The lavas range from alkali-basalt through hawaiite, trachybasalt, trachyandesite and trachyte to comendite. True basalt is relatively rare {{and there is a}} scarcity of analyses with 57 No high pressure mineral assemblages and hence no possible mantle fragments have been found. Petrographic and isotopic data suggest that {{a suite of}} gabbros from Dark Slope Crater crystallised from a magma derived from a MORB-like source. The remaining blocks and all the lavas evolved from magmas derived from a less depleted source. The chemical variation seen in the lavas and blocks is best explained by crystal fractionation mechanisms in a relatively shallow magma chamber. The gabbroic blocks exhibit cumulus textures suggesting that they formed by accumulation of settling crystals. The intermediate to acid blocks compare much more closely in composition with the evolved lavas and are probably their slowly cooled equivalents. There is petrographic evidence that partial melting of intermediate coarse grained material gave rise to melts of granitic composition but these are not chemically equivalent to the <b>acid</b> <b>lavas</b> and blocks. A pegmatoid body crystallised in situ and closed system crystal fractionation alone resulted in a very similar sequence of mineral assemblages to the blocks and lavas and a peralkaline final liquid. High 87 S 4 / 86 Sr ratios in the evolved lavas and blocks are attributable to contamination by a small quantity of highly radiogenic oceanic sediment. Comparison with other oceanic volcanoes suggests that these differentiation processes are much less important in determining the evolutionary path of the magma than its apparent starting composition. </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{study area}} is located 12 km {{away from the}} north east of Sarbisheh at the eastern border of the Lut block (Karimpour et al., 2011; Richards et al., 2012). The magmatic {{activity}} in the Lut blockhas begun in the middle Jurassic (165 - 162 Ma) and reached its peak in the Tertiary age (Jung et al., 1983; Karimpour et al., 2011). Volcanic and subvolcanic rocks in the Tertiary age cover {{over half of the}} Lut block with up to 2000 m thickness and they were formed due to subduction prior to the collision of the Arabian and Asian plates (Jung et al., 1983; Karimpour et al., 2011). In the Kangan area, the basaltic lavas cropped out beyond the above intermediate to acid volcanic rocks. In this area, bentonite and perlite deposits have an economic importance. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a better understanding of the tectono-magmatic settings of volcanic rocks in the northeast of Sarbisheh, east of Iran based on their geochemical characteristics. Materials and methods Fifteen samples were analyzed for major elements by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) technologies and trace elements by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), following a lithium metaborate/tetraborate fusion and nitric acid total digestion, at the Acme laboratories, Vancouver, Canada. Results The Kangan area is located at the northeast of Sarbishe, Southern Khorasan and the eastern border of the Lut block. In this area, basaltic lavas have cropped out above intermediate to <b>acid</b> <b>lavas</b> such as andesite, dacite, rhyolite (sometimes perlitic). The main minerals in the basalt are plagioclase, olivine and pyroxene, in andesite contain plagioclase, pyroxene, biotite and amphibole and in acid rocks include plagioclase, quartz, sanidine, biotite and amphibole. Intermediate to acid rocks have medium to high-K calc-alkaline nature and basalt is alkaline. Enrichment in LREE relative to HREE (Ce/Yb= 21. 14 - 28. 7), high ratio of Zr/Y(4. 79 - 10. 81), enrichment in LILE and negative anomaly of Eu, Nb, P, Ti, Ba and Sr in intermediate to <b>acid</b> <b>lavas</b> are characteristics of subduction related calc-alkaline magmatism. Geochemical characteristics such as high ratio of La/Yb (8. 18), low content of Rb with tectonic setting discriminant diagrams show within plate environment for basalt. The constituent magma of the studied rocks originated from an enriched garnet lherzolite source in 100 to 110 km depth. Discussion Enrichment in LREE relative to HREE (Ce/Yb= 21. 14 - 28. 7), high ratio of Zr/Y (4. 79 - 10. 81), enrichment in LILE and negative anomaly of Eu, Nb, P, Ti, Ba and Sr in intermediate to <b>acid</b> <b>lavas</b> are characteristics of subduction related calc-alkaline magmatism. Tectonic setting discrimination diagrams show that andesite to dacitic rocks are located in active continental margin (Schandle and Gorton, 2002) and basalt is placed within the volcanic plate zone and continental rift type (Verma et al., 2006). Intermediate to acid rocks of Kangan area originated from lithospheric mantle (Moharami et al., 2014) that is enriched by sediment melt related metasomatism (Ersoy et al., 2010) whereas Kangan basaltic lava origin is Nb enriched (Wang et al., 2008; Sajona et al., 1996) mixed lithospheric - asthenospheric mantle (Moharamiet al., 2014). According to the trace elements diagrams (Ellam, 1992), partial melting depth for generation of Kangan area lavas was determined to be about 100 to 110 Km. Because of absent crustal contamination instances in the basalt, it can be argued that ascending of magma has been rapid and probably similar to other alkali basalts in east of Iran, it may be related to deep fault systems.

Field work comprised of geological mapping, soil-, hard-rock- and stream sediment geochemistry, various geophysical techniques and diamond drilling. The rocktypes that resembles the Rustenburg Layered Suite on the farm Rietfontein 70 JS is subdivided into a Mixed Zone, Critical Zone and Main Zone, on grounds of geochemical and certain geophysical attributes. The Mixed Zone that overlies the Bushveld Complex floor-rocks, is furthermore separated into an i) Lower-, ii) Middle- and, iii) Upper Unit. The Lower Unit of the Mixed Zone consists primarily of magnetite-gabbros, iron-rich pegmatites, harzburgites and feldspathic pyroxenites. The Fe-rich constituents of this stratigraphic horizon generates a pronounced magnetic anomaly within the study area. On the basis of; amongst other parameters, Zr/Rb and Sr/Al₂ 0 ₃ ratios, the magnetite-gabbros are postulated to conform to lithotypes in the vicinity of magnetite layers 8 to 14 of Upper Zone Subzone B in a normal Bushveld Complex stratigraphical scenario. Similarly, it is argued that the feldspathic pyroxenites and norites that display elevated chromium values are analogues to normal Critical Zone rocktypes of the Rustenburg Layered Snite. A more elaborate and precise stratigraphic correlation for the Critical zone was, however, not possible. It is advocated that a volume imbalance was created by the hot, ascending mafic magmas of the intruding Bushveld Complex, resulting in the updoming of certain prevailing basement features such as the Dennilton Dome. In addition to this ideology, it is proposed that the Mineral Range Fragment is in fact a large xenolith underlain by mafics, after being detached from the Dennilton Dome during the intrusion event. Evidence generated by this study unequivocally indicate that the potential for viable PGE's, Ni, Cu and Au within a Merensky Reef- type configuration or a Plat Reef-type scenario under a relatively thin veneer of acid Bushveld Complex roof-rocks on the eastern flank of the Dennilton Dome, appears feasible. ...|$|R

The petrologic study of the xenoliths leads them to conclusions {{about the nature of the}} islands' basement and about the paleogeography of the Tyrrhenean Sea. Presence or absence of rock types among the xenoliths limit the possibility for anatexis and assimilation in magma generation and differentiation. Xenoliths transformed by contact metamorphism into cordierite-potash feldspar-hornfelses, plagioclase-pyroxene-hornfelses, calc-silicate-hornfelses, quarzites are witnesses of a thick sedimentary cover, corresponding lithologically to the miopliocene sedimentary cover of the Calabro-Peloritanian massif. Xenoliths of sillimanite-garnet-gneisses, amphibolites and hornblendites and of granitic to granodioritic plutonic rocks prove the existence, under the sedimentary cover, of a basement formed by typical sialic rocks. At Stromboli where hornfelses of sedimentary origin are well represented, up to now no gneissic or granitic xenoliths have been found.

40|$|The Debre Zeyt {{volcanic}} {{district is}} located about 40 km southeast of Addis Ababa, {{on the western}} shoulder of the Ethiopian Rift. Two main phases of volcanic activity are shown to {{have occurred in the}} area, both younger than the main episodes of rifting. Eruption of <b>acid</b> <b>lavas</b> and pyroclastics, between 4 and 1 Ma, brought to the formation of the central volcanoes of Yerer, Bede Gebabe and Zikwala. Younger activity generated basaltic cinder cones, maars and lava flows, all aligned along the main rift direction. A few intermediate and acid volcanics are associated with the younger basalts. Petrological and geochemical investigations have shown that the rocks from central volcanoes consist of peralkaline rhyolites and trachytes with a few trachyandesitic lava flows. All these rocks have high concentrations of Rb, Zr, LREE and other incompatible elements, and variable Ba and Sr contents. Measured Nd isotopic ratios are close to the bulk earth value, whereas Sr isotopic ratios are very variable, due to the combined effects of the high to extreme Rb/Sr values, variable ages and, possibly, different initial isotopic signatures. Basalts range from transitional to weakly alkaline in composition and display relatively homogeneous incompatible element contents and Nd and Sr isotopic ratios. Incompatible element ratios such as Ba/Rb are very variable in the basalts. The younger acid rocks have a large range of incompatible elements concentration with some rhyolites displaying very low values of some hygromagmaphyle trace elements (HYGE), such as Zr, Nb and LREE. The younger intermediate rocks have comparable HYGE contents as the basalts and define linear trends between basalts and low-HYGE rhyolites on several interelement variation diagrams. Geochemical modelling indicates that the major and trace element composition of the acid rocks from central volcanoes can be satisfactorily explained by a derivation from basaltic parents by fractional crystallization. Nd-isotopic ratios which, for the largest part, fall within the range of younger basalts suggest that, except for the Yerer rhyolites, the assimilation of the upper continental crust did not play a major role during magma evolution. The relatively constant HYGE contents of basaltic and intermediate younger volcanics exclude an evolution by fractional crystallization for this suite. The linear trends on inter-element diagrams suggest that mixing processes between basaltic magmas and an acid rock or liquid may be responsible for the generation of the intermediate rocks. This hypothesis is supported by Ba/Rb vs. Rb relationships revealing hyperbolic mixing trends between acid and basaltic end-members. This process also generated important geochemical variations within the basalts...|$|R
40|$|Sitting atop old oceanic {{crust of}} 7 Ma, Bouvet (Lat. 54 ° 26 ’S, long. 3 ° 24 ’E) is a solitary, ice-capped and pint sized (55 km 2) {{volcanic}} {{island in the}} Southernmost Atlantic Ocean. It is located off-axis the Southwest Indian Ridge {{in the vicinity of}} the triple point joining the African, South American, and Antarctic plates. As early as the seventies, this island has been regarded as being the surface expression of a mantle plume, which triggered the break-up of the Gondwanaland supercontinent. However, the detailed lower mantle structure of the Bouvet hotspot is largely unknown, because seismic ray coverage of the lowermost mantle under the southwestern Indian Ocean is weak. Surface wave tomography lacks the lateral resolution to image small-scale structures such as hotspots, expected to generate anomalies only a few hundred kilometers wide. The geology of the island is also poorly known because of the presence of a permanent ice cap. Previous studies (e. g. Verwoerd et al., 1990) have established the presence of solely two geological formations: a lower hydrothermally altered sequence of mainly pyroclastic rocks and an upper formation of predominantly subaerial lava flows. This latter unit consists of mainly mildly alkaline basalts, and carries minor amounts of intermediate and <b>acid</b> <b>lavas,</b> ranging in age from 1. 39 Ma to < 0. 1 Ma. The early magmatic evolution of the island is virtually unknown. The geochemical data presented here are based on a suite of about 25 samples collected from the coastlines of Bouvet Island. The serie extends from basic (mildly alkaline basalts) to intermediate (benmoreites) and acid rocks (rhyolites). None of our samples (MgO < 4. 84 wt. %) can be regarded as a primary product of mantle melting. The alkali basalt lavas are chemically homogeneous in spanning a narrow range of major and trace element variability. These lavas all show strong light Rare Earth Element (REE) enrichment typical of ocean island basalts and the overall parallel REE trends show increasing enrichment in all the REE from hawaiite through to rhyolite. The similarity of their trace element ratios and parallelism of their rare earth element patterns indicate: (1) a mantle source homogeneity; (2) an uniformity of the melting conditions (i. e. degree of melting and residual mineralogy) during most of the sub-aerial eruptive history. Their trace element systematics are not typical of a HIMU-like mantle source. Their homogeneous Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic composition occupy an intermediate position among the isotopic variability spectrum defined by Earth's oceanic island basalts, encompassing the isotopic variability range of the common component “C” representing the intersection point of the isotopic arrays of ocean island and mid-ocean ridge suites in two or in three dimensional isotopic spaces...|$|R
40|$|Tungurahua, one of Ecuador's {{most active}} volcanoes, {{is made up}} of three {{volcanic}} edifices. Tungurahua 1 was a 14 -km-wide andesitic stratocone which experienced at least one sector collapse followed by the extrusion of a dacite lava series. Tungurahua 2, mainly composed of <b>acid</b> andesite <b>lava</b> flows younger than 14, 000 years BP, was partly destroyed by the last collapse event, 2955 plus or minus 90 years ago, which left a large amphitheater and produced an approximately 8 -km 3 debris deposit. The avalanche collided with the high ridge immediately {{to the west of the}} cone and was diverted to the northwest and southwest for approximately 15 km. A larger lahar formed during this event, which was followed in turn by dacite extrusion. Southwestward, the damming of the Chambo valley by the avalanche deposit resulted in an approximately 10 -km-long lake, which was subsequently breached, generating another catastrophic debris flow. The eruptive activity of the present volcano (Tungurahua 3) has rebuilt the cone to about 50 % of its pre-collapse size by the emission of approximately 3 km 3 of volcanic products. Two periods of construction are recognized in Tungurahua's 3 history. From approximately 2300 to approximately 1400 years BP, high rates of lava extrusion and pyroclastic flows occurred. During this period, the magma composition did not evolve significantly, remaining essentially basic andesite. During the last appromatively 1300 years, eruptive episodes take place roughly once per century and generally begin with lapilli fall and pyroclastic flow activity of varied composition (andesite + dacite), and end with more basic andesite lava flows or crater plugs.

In the vicinity of Sonho Meu Farm, there is some part of an <b>acid</b> to intermediate <b>lava</b> dome, which is 2 km long and 250 m wide. The dome has a hypabyssal core that changes laterally to an autoclastic facies rich in pumice and shards with mingling textures, and subsequently to a facies with flow structures. The core has porphyritic texture and phenocrysts of plagioclase and biotite embedded in a medium-grained matrix of the same composition. The pumice-rich facies has a texture similar to ignimbrites and reoignimbrites. In this facies, a porphyritic to glomeroporphyritic texture is observed, with evidence of pumice collapse. The magma mixture is characterized by clusters of hornblende and plagioclase, {{in the form of}} millimetric to decimetric enclaves. Geochemical data on the rocks with no evidence of mingling indicate metaluminous to peraluminous high-K calcalkaline compositions. Rare earth elements patterns show a slight enrichment in LREE over HREE. Geochemical data show an enrichment in Rb, Sr, and K 2 O and a negative Ta-Nb anomaly, which is common in calcalkaline rocks. Concentrations of trace elements are compatible with post-collisional tectonic environments. U-Pb zircon geochronology yields an age of 1. 87 Ga. Sm-Nd isotopic studies report negative €Nd values and Archean Nd model ages, indicating contamination by crustal material.

40|$|The Soufriandegrave;re region, which {{includes}} the most recently active volcanic centre {{on the island of}} St. andnbsp;Lucia in the West Indies, is the site of a relatively recent volcanic caldera. This structure, with a diameter of approximately 4 miles, has an age of definitely more than 50, 000 years and probably of several times this age. Apart from continuous solfataric activity, there have been no historic eruptions, and the morphology of the caldera has been considerably modified by erosion since the time of its formation. The history of volcanic events in the Soufriandegrave;re region may be divided into four principal phases: the first involved the effusion of basalt lava from vents both within and to the east of the site of the ultimate caldera. During the second phase, following what was probably a long time-interval, a group of andesitic strato-volcanoes developed in an area slightly to the northeast of the ultimate caldera. These emitted andesite flows and, apparently, a very large volume (estimated a 6 cubic miles) of pyroclastic material, probably mainly as glowing avalanches. The third phase opened with the emission of andesite pumice fall and pumice flow from a vent which probably lay within the ultimate caldera. After an erosion interval, activity was renewed on a more violent scale, in a series of ultravulcanian explosions, and these were followed by a second period of voluminous, andesite pumice flows which immediately preceded caldera subsidence. The fourth and final phase has occupied the relatively long period since collapse, during which fifteen volcanic domes and seven craters have developed within the caldera: initially of andesitic composition, around the margin of the caldera, and subsequently of dacite lava, towards the centre of the collapsed area. The effusion of these lavas was accompanied by pyroclastic eruptions of pumice fall (with an estimated volume of 1. 23 cu. miles) and pumice flows (with an estimated volume of 0. 27 cu. mile). The youngest large pumice flow, dated by the radiocarbon method, occurred 39, 050 years ago. The mineralogy of the St. andnbsp;Lucian lavas compares closely with that of typical, calcium-rich, island-arc suites. All rocks contain calcic plagioclase phenocrysts, the cores of which generally consist of bytownite while the rims, especially in the andesites and dacites, include oscillatory zones in which the calcium content commonly decreases to a minimum of about An 40. The mafic minerals in the basalts include augitic clinopyroxene, with or without orthopyroxene and olivine, whilst in the andesites, orthopyroxene (hypersthene or ferrohypersthene) predominates. The dacites are characterized by amphibole (common hornblende, oxyhornblende, or cummingtonite) and biotite, with subordinate orthopyroxene and occasional olivine phenocrysts, accompanied by 5 andndash; 15 % of large, rounded or bipyramidal phenocrysts of quartz. The youngest dacites of the Soufriandegrave;re region are unusual in that they contain phenocrysts of calcium-poor, cummingtonitic amphibole. Twenty new analyses of whole rocks from St. andnbsp;Lucia are presented, and these extend over a silica range from 50 % in the earliest to 66 % in the most recent products. The suite is relatively rich in alumina (15 andndash; 19 %) and poor in alkalis (Na 2 O up to 3. 5 % K 2 O up to 1. 5 %), although by West Indian standards the potash content is high. The rocks as a whole are members of the calc-alkaline, "Pacific" series, characteristic of mobile structural belts. The silica variation diagram for St. andnbsp;Lucia illustrates the compositional heterogeneity of the basalts, and the gap (from 53 andndash; 59 %) in silica content, which also corresponds to the gap in time between the eruption of the basalts (phase 1) and the andesites (phase 2). The andesites, on the other hand, appear to be closely related to the dacites, forming a single, continuous series. A comparison of the Feandnbsp;: Mgandnbsp;: Na+K ratios reveals the close chemical similarity of the andesites and dacites of St. andnbsp;Lucia to those of Crater Lake, Oregon, and to the "hypersthenic" series of Hakone volcano, Japan. The Caandnbsp;: Naandnbsp;: K ratios show that the rocks of St. andnbsp;Lucia contain a higher proportion of potash relative to soda and lime than most other suites of the orogenic regions. The distribution of the minor elements in ten rocks from St. andnbsp;Lucia conforms closely to that found in other West Indian and orogenic volcanic suites, with the notable exception of rubidium, which is much more abundant in the acid rocks of St. andnbsp;Lucia than in those of other suites from the Lesser Antilles. A co-variance plot of seven minor elements in the analysed samples from St. andnbsp;Lucia provides an arrangement of specimens along the abscissa which is closely parallel to the order according to silica content, and this in turn corresponds to the chronologic sequence of eruption. The basalts of St. andnbsp;Lucia are believed to have crystallized from essentially unmodified, primary magma. The occurrence in the Soufriandegrave;re region of two basalt varieties, namely porphyritic and aphyric, is explicable either {{as the result of the}} accumulation at depth of plagioclase felspar crystals, or alternatively may be attributed to the independent development two primary magmas, of tholeiitic and alumina-rich types. There is no support in the Soufriandegrave;re region for differentiation of basalt, or assimilation by primary basalt magma, on a sufficiently extensive scale to produce the observed volume and sequence of the more <b>acid</b> <b>lavas.</b> It is, therefore, proposed that the andesites and dacites of St. andnbsp;Lucia were derived largely by partial melting of local crustal material. </p...|$|R
40|$|The first spaceflight {{was several}} decades ago, and yet {{extraterrestrial}} exploration is {{only at the}} beginning and has mainly been carried out by robotic probes and rovers sent to extraterrestrial planets and deep space. In the future human extraterrestrial exploration will take place and to get ready for long periods of permanence in space, astronauts are trained during long duration missions on the International Space Station (ISS). To prepare for such endeavours, team training activities are performed in extreme environments on Earth, as isolated deserts, base camps on Antarctica, or stations built {{on the bottom of the}} sea, trying to simulate the conditions and operations of space. Space agencies are also particularly interested in the search of signs of life forms in past or present extreme natural environments, such as salt lakes in remote deserts, very deep ocean habitats, submarine volcanic areas, sulphuric <b>acid</b> caves, and <b>lava</b> tubes. One natural environment that very realistically mimics an extraterrestrial exploration habitat is the cave. Caves are dark, remote places, with constant temperature, many logistic problems and stressors (isolation, communication and supply difficulties, physical barriers), and their exploration requires discipline, teamwork, technical skills and a great deal of behavioural adaptation. For this reason, since 2008 the European Space Agency has carried out training activities in the subterranean environment and the CAVES project is one of those training courses, probably the most realistic one. CAVES stands for Cooperative Adventure for Valuing and Exercising human behaviour and performance Skills, and is meant as a multidisciplinary multicultural team exploration mission in a cave. It has been developed by ESA in the past few years (2008 - 2011) and is open for training of astronauts of the ISS Partner Space Agencies (USA, Russia, Japan, Canada, and Europe). Astronauts are first trained for 5 days to explore, document and survey a karst system, then take on a cave exploration mission for 6 days underground. A team of expert cave instructors, a Human Behaviour and Performance facilitator, scientists and video reporters, ensure that all tasks are performed in complete safety and guides all these astronauts 2 ̆ 7 activities. During the underground mission the astronauts 2 ̆ 7 technical competences are challenged (exploring, surveying, taking pictures), their human behaviour and decision-making skills are debriefed, and they are required to carry out an operational programme which entails performing scientific tasks and testing equipment, similarly to what they are required to do on the ISS. The science program includes environmental and air circulation monitoring, mineralogy, microbiology, chemical composition of waters, and search for life forms adapted to the cavern environment. The CAVES 2012 Course will be explained and the first interesting scientific results will be presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} signs of past or present {{extraterrestrial}} life requires autonomous instrumentation capable of robust and highly sensitive in situ analysis of {{a broad range of}} organic compound classes. The Mars Organic Analyzer (MOA) is a portable microchip capillary electrophoresis (&muCE) instrument developed for highly sensitive chemical biomarker analysis. This thesis expands the capabilities of the MOA to highly-sensitive analysis of PAHs, aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids in conventional and extremely acidic and saline samples, and demonstrates proof-of-principle for using programmable valve arrays for autonomous sample processing. A &muCE separation and analysis method for PAHs is optimized, resulting in baseline separation of a nine-PAH standard with limits of detection (LODs) ranging from 2000 ppm to 6 ppb. Analysis of an environmental contamination standard from Lake Erie and a hydrothermal vent chimney sample agree with published composition; analysis of a Martian analogue sample from the Yungay Hills (Atacama Desert) is found to contain several PAHs at ppm levels. Pacific Blue succinimidyl ester is used as an improved fluorescent label for amines and amino acids enabling sub-pptr LODs, and a micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) method is developed for enhanced compositional analysis. These methods are applied to the analysis of samples from the Murchison meteorite and the Yungay hills (Atacama Desert). Previous MOA analysis methods suffer from artificially low signal and resolution when samples are acidic, saline, or contain polyvalent cations. To address this challenge, new analysis, labeling, and dilution buffers are developed. Higher ionic strength buffer systems provide better buffering capacity and salt tolerance, and addition of ethylamine-diaminetetraacetic (EDTA) acid effectively neutralizes deleterious effects of multivalent cations. These optimized methods enable analysis of amino acids in a brine sample from Saline Valley, California, and a subcritical water extract of a highly acidic sample from the Rio Tinto, Spain. MOA analysis methods for oxidized organic carbon are developed and optimized using the fluorescent probe Cascade Blue hydrazide (CB). Hydrazone formation of CB with aldehydes and ketones requires pH 5 - 6, CB-labeling of 1 -ethyl- 3 [3 -dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide (EDC) activated carboxylic acids is optimized to pH 3, and separations are optimized at pH 9. 5, 20 o C. Standards developed based on oxidized organics detected in the Murchison meteorite are analyzed, with pM - nM LODs. Aldehyde and ketone analyses are validated via the analysis of several fermented beverages and a basaltic Martian simulant sample. Several polycarboxylic derivatives of benzene, including mellitic acid, are analyzed, demonstrating the first analysis of these highly oxidized molecules on a portable instrument. Successful analyses of carboxylic <b>acids</b> in a <b>lava</b> tube cave sample (Mojave Desert, CA) and a Bumpass Hell hydrothermal area sample (Lassen National Park) demonstrate the utility and versatility of this method. Finally, an autonomous sample processing system based on the programmable microfluidic rectilinear array Automaton is demonstrated at a proof-of-concept level. Prospects for further development of this sample processing system are considered, as are further enhancements of the total analysis system. The methods developed here are also critically compared to other proposed in situ life detection instruments...|$|R
