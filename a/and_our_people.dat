500|$|In Germany, on {{the morning}} of 22 June, Nazi {{propaganda}} minister Joseph Goebbels announced the invasion to the waking nation in a radio broadcast with Hitlers words: [...] "At this moment a march is taking place that, for its extent, compares with the greatest the world has ever seen.

[...] Later the same morning, Hitler proclaimed to his colleagues, [...] "Before three months have passed, we shall witness a collapse of Russia, the like of which has never been seen in history." [...] Hitler also addressed the German people via the radio, presenting himself as a man of peace, who reluctantly had to attack the Soviet Union. Following the invasion, Goebbels openly spoke of a [...] "European crusade against Bolshevism", but omitted the terrible fate that awaited Jews in allied and friendly countries.|$|E

'I think your government would want to weigh very, very carefully the kind of outcry that would occur in this country against your taking this kind of action.'

2500|$|The United States {{began to}} support Contra {{activities}} against the Sandinista government by December 1981, with the CIA {{at the forefront}} of operations.

The agency added to the Contras' sabotage efforts by blowing up refineries and pipelines, and mining ports. Finally, according to former Contra leader Edgar Chamorro, CIA trainers also gave Contra soldiers large knives.

2500|$|Still {{pointing}} {{his gun at}} Klein, Haq {{took the}} phone and informed the police {{that he had taken}} hostages. He repeated his previous explanation that he was upset about the war in Iraq and U.S. support of Israel. He also said, [...] "hese are Jews. I'm tired of getting pushed around, <b>and</b> <b>our</b> <b>people</b> getting pushed around by the situation in the Middle East." [...] He also demanded that the U.S. military get out of Iraq. He asked if he could be patched through to CNN. The dispatcher told Haq that was not possible, and informed him that talking with the media would not alter U.S. policy. Haq calmed down and told the dispatcher that he would surrender. He then put his guns down and walked silently out of the building with his hands on his head. He surrendered at 4:15p.m. and was taken into custody by police. At 10:38p.m., he was booked into King County Jail on one count of investigation of homicide and five counts of investigation of attempted murder.|$|E
2500|$|After the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the Meiji {{government}} {{endeavored to}} assimilate Western ideas, {{technological advances and}} ways of warfare. By the late 19th century, Japan had transformed itself into a modernized industrial state. The Japanese wanted {{to be recognized as}} equal with the Western powers. The Meiji restoration had always been intended to make Japan a modernized state, not a Westernized one, and Japan was always an imperialist power, looking towards overseas expansionism. In the years 1869–73, the Seikanron ("Conquer Korea Argument") had bitterly divided the Japanese elite between one faction that wanted to conquer Korea immediately vs. another that wanted to wait until Japan was more modernized before embarking on a war to conquer Korea; significantly no-one in the Japanese elite ever accepted the idea that the Koreans had the right to be independent, with only the question of timing dividing the two factions. In {{much the same way that}} Europeans used the backwardness of Africa and Asia as a reason for why they had to conquer nations of Africa and Asia, for the Japanese elite the backwardness of China and Korea was proof of the inferiority of those nations, thus giving the Japanese the [...] "right" [...] to conquer them. Inouye Kaoru, the Foreign Minister gave a speech in 1887 saying [...] "What we must do is to transform our empire <b>and</b> <b>our</b> <b>people,</b> make the empire like the countries of Europe <b>and</b> <b>our</b> <b>people</b> like the peoples of Europe", going to say that the Chinese and Koreans had essentially forfeited their right to be independent by not modernizing. Much of the pressure for an aggressive foreign policy in Japan came from below, with the advocates of [...] "people's rights" [...] movement calling for an elected parliament also favoring an ultra-nationalist line that took it for granted the Japanese had the [...] "right" [...] to annex Korea, as the [...] "people's right" [...] movement was led by those who favored invading Korea in the years 1869–73. As part of the modernization process in Japan, Social Darwinian ideas about the [...] "survival of the fittest" [...] were common in Japan from the 1880s onward and many ordinary Japanese resented the heavy taxes imposed by the government to modernize Japan, demanding something tangible like an overseas colony as a reward for their sacrifices. Furthermore, the educational system of Meiji Japan was meant to train the schoolboys to be soldiers when they grew up, and as such, Japanese schools indoctrinated their students into Bushido ("the spirit of the warriors"), the fierce code of the samurai. Having indoctrinated the younger generations into Bushido, the Meiji elite found themselves faced with a people who clamored for war, and regarded diplomacy as a weakness. The British Japanologist Richard Storry wrote the biggest misconception about Japan in the West was that the Japanese people were the [...] "docile" [...] instruments of the elite, when in fact much of the pressure for Japan's wars from 1894 to 1941 came from below, as ordinary people demanded a [...] "tough" [...] foreign policy, and tended to engage in riots and assassination when foreign policy was perceived to be pusillanimous. Though the Meiji oligarchy refused to allow democracy, they did seek to appropriate some of the demands of the [...] "people's rights" [...] movement by allowing an elected Diet in 1890 (with limited powers and an equally limited franchise) and by pursuing an aggressive foreign policy towards Korea.|$|E
