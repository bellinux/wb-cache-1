40|$|Equine {{cutaneous}} {{mast cell}} tumours (CMCTs) are {{generally considered to}} be benign skin lesions, although recurrent and multicentric tumours have been described. For canine CMCTs, grading and prognostic approaches are well established and aberrant KIT expression as well as high proliferation indices are associated with poor outcome. However, in the case of equine CMCTs, morphological features, proliferative activity and KIT expression pattern have not been assessed or related to biological behaviour, and there is discussion as to whether CMCTs are true neoplastic processes. The present study describes 45 equine CMCTs in terms of their morphology and KIT and PCNA expression by immunohistochemistry. KIT expression was classified as membranous (I), cytoplasmic and focally stippled (II) or diffuse cytoplasmic (III). A large proportion of the tumours were multinodular or diffuse dermal infiltrates of mast cells with mild <b>anisokaryosis,</b> a low proliferative rate and a dominance of KIT pattern I, representing well-differentiated CMCTs. In approximately one third of the cases, the mast cells exhibited more infiltrative growth, moderate to marked <b>anisokaryosis</b> and a higher degree of proliferation. These were classified as poorly differentiated CMCTs and exhibited only KIT patterns II and III. These findings indicate that there is a subgroup of poorly differentiated equine CMCTs, in which there is an association between aberrant KIT expression, high proliferative rate and potential aggressive behaviour, all features that confirm at least the poorly differentiated CMCT as a true neoplastic processes...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Tumors {{affecting}} Bartholin’s gland {{are considered}} rare in human medicine; {{there are few}} reports in the veterinary literature, with descriptions occurring only in cows. This article described the clinical and pathological findings associated with Bartholin’s gland adenoma in a goat. Clinically, a 7 -year-old pregnant Saanen goat presented bilateral enlargement of the vulva that did not regress spontaneously after parturition. Grossly, these vulvar masses were multilobulated, contained cystic areas from which oozed a whitish fluid. Histopathology revealed an adenoma characterized by the proliferation of irregularly shaped neoplastic epithelial cells that formed tubular to glandular-like structures. These neoplastic cells demonstrated moderate <b>anisokaryosis</b> and evident nucleoli. The intratumoral proliferation index (PI) was estimated by immunoreactivity with the protein ki- 67. Further, the glandular-like structures produced a Periodic Acid-Schiff positive secretion.

40|$|Five {{extracts}} {{were obtained}} from Ageratum conyzoides leaf extracted in methanol-water (4 : 1). They were neutral extract (in ethyl acetate), moderately polar extract (in chloroform); basic extract (in chloroform-methanol), polar extract (in methanol), and filtrate. Three extracts were tested biologically and the moderately polar extract {{was found to be}} most toxic for female Wistar rats. While the toxicity of neutral extract was mild and other extracts were non-toxic. Therefore, the moderately polar extract was investigated for the hepatoxicity effects in the present study. Intragastric dosing of this extract in rats has caused mortality with clinical signs of weakness, low activity and death. Pathological examination showed mottling on the capsular surface of liver. Microscopically showed <b>anisokaryosis,</b> megalocytosis, bile duct cells proliferation and necrosis. Multiple dosing of this extract may lead to liver and lung injury showing <b>anisokaryosis,</b> megalocytosis, bile duct cells proliferation, centrolobular necrosis, vacuolisation, mitotic figures and mononuclear cells infiltration in the liver and epithelialisation of alveolar walls, thickening of alveolar walls and oedema in the lungs. Liver regeneration occurred 7 days after the last dosing showing mitotic figures and return to the normal structure of liver. The average body weight gain reduced during the first 3 weeks of intoxication from 127. 6 g. on predosing to 120, 4 g. on week- 3 followed by an increased on body weight until the last experiment to 130. 8 g. when dosing of extract was terminated. There was an increased of alanine amino transferase (ALAT) during the first 2 days after dosing from 14. 6 IU/ 1 to 23. 0 IU/ 1 and reduced at the following days to 7. 5 IU/ 1 at day- 5 after dosing. Dosing with retrorsin has caused an increased in ALAT consistently during the first 5 days to 8. 7 IU/ 1. The activity of aspartate amino transferase (ASAT) reduced during the first 3 days after dosing with the extract from 29. 2 IU/ 1 to 15. 1 IU/I and from 15. 9 IU/ 1 to 8. 9 IU/ 1 with retrorsin, but both enzymes appeared higher than control rats.

A total of 11 dogs with abdominal effusion due to ovarian neoplasm histologically confirmed were included: papillary adenocarcinoma (8), granulosa cell tumour (2), and a mixed gonadostromal tumour (granulosa cell tumour and luteoma). In abdominal effusion of 7 cases out of 8 papillary adenocarcinomas, neoplastic cells were present. Cytology of the effusions revealed high cellularity, large tridimensional clusters of cells arranged in papillary pattern, and small aggregates of cells with microacinar arrangement. Tightly cohesive, roundish, oval or cuboidal cells with moderate anisocytosis and <b>anisokaryosis,</b> variable nuclear atypia, and scarce to moderate amount of sometimes vacuolated grey cytoplasm were present. Granulosa cell tumours caused serosanguineous effusion without neoplastic cells. Gonadostromal tumour caused serosanguineous effusion with neoplastic cells. Smears of the effusion {{were characterized by}} high cellularity, aggregates of moderately cohesive cells, dysmetric nuclei, prominent nucleoli and large grey, often microvacuolated cytoplasm.

40|$|Background: Cytologic {{diagnosis}} of hepatocellular carcinoma is possible when hepatocytes have prominent criteria of malignancy, but is problematic when hepatocytes {{have a relatively}} normal morphologic appearance. Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the cytologic features of histologically confirmed well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (WD-HCC) in dogs to develop reasonable criteria for an accurate diagnosis when obvious criteria of malignancy in hepatocytes are lacking. Methods: Slides of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspirates of 15 histologically confirmed WD-HCC in dogs were evaluated retrospectively using a scoring system (0 – 3) established for 33 cytologic features. For comparison, 15 cytologic samples of non-nodular non-neoplastic liver were evaluated using the same criteria. Statistical analysis included multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method or false discovery rate control to correct for multiple comparisons. Results: The most significant and useful cytologic features in the {{diagnosis of}} canine WD-HCC were dissociation of hepatocytes, acinar or palisading arrangements of neoplastic cells, and the presence of naked nuclei and capillaries, together with mild anisocytosis, <b>anisokaryosis,</b> multinuclearity, and increased N:C ratios. Conclusions: Cytologic features of canine WD-HCC were determined. Further studies are warranted to compare these cytologic criteria among WDHCC, hepatomas, and hyperplastic nodules and to examine co-variance of the 33 cytologic features...|$|E
40|$|To {{elucidate}} the specific cytomorphologic patterns and diagnostic pitfalls in fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of parathyroid lesions. STUDY DESIGN: Seventy-two cases of surgically excised and pathologically verified hyperparathyroidism (20 cases of parathyroid hyperplasia, 51 of parathyroid adenoma {{and one of}} parathyroid carcinoma) received preoperative, ultrasound-guided FNAC examination for enlarged parathyroid glands. The smears were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: Parathyroid lesions were diagnosed cytologically in 60 cases (83. 3 %). The presence of colloidlike substance, macrophages or follicular structures in smears led to six cases (8. 3 %) being misinterpreted as thyroid lesions. The cellularity of the smears was insufficient for interpretation in six cases (8. 3 %); however, two of these cases were diagnosed by determination of parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in the fluid. Parathyroid hyperplasia had more tightly cohesive cell clusters with monomorphism, while parathyroid adenoma had more dispersed or loosely cohesive cells with pleomorphism and <b>anisokaryosis.</b> High PTH concentration in an aspirate was noted in all four cases of cystic lesions. CONCLUSION: FNAC provides valuable information for preoperative diagnosis of parathyroid lesions. Colloidlike substance or macrophages do not exclude the diagnosis. Determination of PTH levels in aspirated fluid is helpful for the diagnosis, especially when the cellularity of the smears is insufficient for interpretatio...|$|E
40|$|To {{elucidate}} three-dimensional (3 -D) cytomorphology in fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of parathyroid lesions. STUDY DESIGN: Ultrasound- guided FNAB {{was performed}} on parathyroid lesions from 10 patients with hyperparathyroidism. The aspirates were stained and observed under a light microscope (LM). The aspirates were also fixed, dehydrated, critical point dried, spattered with gold ions and observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Findings under SEM were correlated with the appearances under LM {{as well as with}} serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations. RESULTS: Under LM, nine cases displayed isokaryosis and one case, <b>anisokaryosis.</b> These appearances corresponded to isocytosis or anisocytosis under SEM. Under SEM, 3 -D cytomorphology of parathyroid lesions displayed isocytotic, scattered cells in five cases, uniform cellular arrangements in four cases and anisocytotic, scattered cells in one case. The cell surface was rather smooth in five cases. The other five cases had significant granules on the cell surfaces; these all had serum PTH concentrations = 3 D 268 pg/mL. CONCLUSION: 3 -D cytomorphology in FNAB of parathyroid lesions was a rather smooth cell surface in cases with low serum PTH and a granular cell surface in cases with significantly increased serum PTH. These characteristics and the absence of microvilli might be helpful in the differential diagnosis between parathyroid and follicular thyroid lesions...|$|E
40|$|A Belgian {{shepherd}} dog aged 4 {{years and}} 9 months {{was presented with}} acute onset of non-weight bearing lameness and stifle effusion of the left hind limb, caused by the deep form of a malignant fibrous histiocytoma originating in the deep musculature and fascia surrounding the stifle joint. The tumour progressed rapidly in the tissues along the femoral diaphysis with marked periosteal new bone formation. Cytology of a stifle joint aspirate revealed numerous large polygonal neoplastic cells with considerable anisocytosis and <b>anisokaryosis.</b> These cells were present in clusters, with cytoplasmic projections between the cells, but occasionally also occurred singly. Several cells contained multiple cytoplasmic vacuoles and occasional giant cells were also encountered. Adequate tumour-free margins were not possible with radical limb amputation and the dog was euthanased. Macroscopically the tumour appeared as an extensive pale tan, firm mass with scattered small haemorrhages and foci of yellow discolouration. Histologically the tumour consisted of dense neoplastic expanses or multiple nodules, composed of spindle-shaped fibroblastic cells, polygonal histiocytic cells or cell clusters and scattered giant cells with 2 - 3 nuclei. The polygonal neoplastic cells were frequently present around and invading lymphatics and blood vessels, causing neoplastic emboli. This is the 1 st report of the clinical behaviour, radiography and cytology of the deep form of malignant fibrous histiocytoma in the dog...|$|E
40|$|Melanocytic tumors and melanomas in {{domestic}} animals include neoplasms composed of melanin-producing cells. In cattle, these tumors are rare and mostly benign, while malignant tumors are almost non-existent. The article reports {{the case of}} a female crossbred cow 38 months of age with a fluctuating mass located between the mandibular border and the left parotid region, about three months duration, with evident growth in the last thirty days. After surgical excision, a sample preserved in buffered formalin (10 %) was sent to the Laboratory of Pathology (University of Nariño) —consisting of a fragment of 7. 0 × 10. 5 × 8. 0 cm, ellipsoid, with skin and hair on one side, irregular surface, blackish brown, semi-soft consistency, and presence of shear translucent slimy content—for processing and inclusion in paraffin, cut to 5 μm thickness and stained with hematoxylin-eosin coloration. The forwarded tissue was classified as a neoplasm of malignant behavior derived from melanocytes, due to its cellular characteristics: growth pattern, pattern of distribution, severe cellular pleomorphism, anisocytosis, megalocytosis, nuclear pleomorphism, <b>anisokaryosis,</b> megalokaryosis, and involvement of blood vessel walls; additionally, the paraffin block was cut for immunohistochemical processing using monoclonal markers (S- 100 DAKO® and Melan A DAKO®), contrasted with Mayer’s hematoxylin. Strong immunostaining of neoplastic cells is evident, and it constitutes the first reported case of this disease in Nariño (Colombia) ...|$|E
