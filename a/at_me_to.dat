500|$|In the mid- to late 1990s, Guillermo Scott Herren {{returned}} to Decatur, Georgia, from New York {{and worked at}} a recording studio. Unsatisfied working with the studio's clients, who he felt made [...] "pre-historic trap music", Herren was encouraged to take his music in a more left-field direction, as he was [...] "bored with people barking orders <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make them these really boring rap beats." [...] In return for Herren handling the studio's hip hop clients, the studio owner bought him a Music Production Center (MPC) which Herren would use to create his Prefuse 73 material.|$|E
500|$|Webber's orchestral accompaniment added a {{different}} level to the track, with its composition consisting of pizzicato strings, and its flowing tempo introducing Covington's opening vocals. The song jumps from being light to heavy and extravagant, with one section of it being hummed by choral voices. As the final lyrics goes, [...] "But {{all you have to}} do is look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> know / That every word is true" [...] is sung, the London Philharmonic Orchestra comes into play with a huge climax and ends. According to the sheet music published by Music Sales Group, the song starts with a sequence of G/D–A7/D–D–Bm/D, changes to E–E/D–A/C–E7–A–D, with the chorus featuring a chord progression of A–Bm–Dmaj7–Gmaj7–G–Fm7. The song is composed in the key of C major with Covington's vocals spanning from the nodes of E3 to G5.|$|E
500|$|With the {{new season}} of the J.League commencing in March 1995, Wenger set about {{assembling}} his squad and backroom staff. He hired former Valenciennes manager Boro Primorac, whom he had befriended during the match-fixing scandal, as his assistant. Alexandre Torres joined Nagoya after Wenger identified the defender by watching Brazilian football on the television, and the manager brought in Franck Durix and his former player Passi. Nagoya finished bottom of the J.League the season before Wenger's arrival, and continued their poor form into the following campaign, losing several matches in a row. In response to the situation, Wenger altered his managerial style, becoming less amicable with his players and openly questioning their desire. To boost morale, he took his squad to Versailles for their mid-season break, where they went through a rigorous, but creative, training regime. Players were expected to make decisions for themselves on the pitch, instead of relying on the manager; Wenger {{was reported to have}} shouted to his players [...] "Don't look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> ask me {{what to do with the}} ball!" [...] and [...] "Decide for yourself! Why don't you think it out?" [...] One player who greatly benefited from Wenger's guidance was Dragan Stojković, a midfielder whose disciplinary record improved considerably.|$|E

2500|$|Bow's bohemian {{lifestyle}} and [...] "dreadful" [...] manners were considered {{reminders of the}} Hollywood elite's uneasy position in high society. Bow fumed: [...] "They yell <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be dignified. But what are the dignified people like? The people who are held up as examples for me? They are snobs. Frightful snobs... I'm a curiosity in Hollywood. I'm a big freak, because I'm myself!" ...|$|E

60|$|She made small eyes <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{discover}} if I was angry. She {{seemed to}} have an invincible faith in the virtuous dispositions of young men. And as I had spoken in measured tones and hadn’t got {{red in the face}} she let herself go.|$|E

60|$|As will be imagined, {{these words}} took the Sultan by surprise, {{and he looked}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> see how I should take the {{statement}} of the princess. As I was unable to speak, I placed my hand on my head {{to show that it}} was true.|$|E

60|$|ZOO. I {{know you}} are a murderer.

60|$|My neighbour, a fat, jolly man, told me {{all about}} it. His neighbour, a {{handsome}} tipsy man, kept contradicting and saying it wasn't so. But my fat neighbour winked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> not <b>to</b> take offence.|$|R
