40|$|This paper {{describes}} a systematic approach to <b>material</b> <b>and</b> process selection during the embodiment design of mechanical components {{and a system}} for generating process <b>and</b> <b>material</b> selection advice. Quite often during the embodiment design stage, design requirements are not precisely defined. Therefore, the system described in this paper accounts for imprecision in design requirements during generation and evaluation of alternative process sequences <b>and</b> <b>material</b> options. To reduce the computational effort, the system uses a depth-first branch-andbound search algorithm. This aids in exploring promising process sequences <b>and</b> <b>material</b> options {{that can be used}} to meet the given set of design requirements. Various process sequences <b>and</b> <b>material</b> options are evaluated by using a commercial cost estimation tool. ...|$|R
