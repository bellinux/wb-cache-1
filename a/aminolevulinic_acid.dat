5|$|One of {{the main}} causes for the {{pathology}} of lead is that it interferes with the activity of an essential enzyme called delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, or ALAD (see image of the enzyme structure), which {{is important in the}} biosynthesis of heme, the cofactor found in hemoglobin. Lead also inhibits the enzyme ferrochelatase, another enzyme involved in the formation of heme. Ferrochelatase catalyzes the joining of protoporphyrin and Fe2+ to form heme. Lead's interference with heme synthesis results in production of zinc protoporphyrin and the development of anemia. Another effect of lead's interference with heme synthesis is the buildup of heme precursors, such as <b>aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid,</b> which may be directly or indirectly harmful to neurons.|$|E

50|$|P. acnes glows orange {{when exposed}} to blacklight, {{possibly}} due {{to the presence of}} endogenous porphyrins. The bacterium is killed by ultraviolet light. P. acnes is also especially sensitive to light in the 405 - 420 nanometer (near the ultraviolet) range due to an endogenic porphyrin - coporphyrin III.

40|$|Abstract Background Lead {{exposure}} {{is common in}} automobile battery manufacture and repair, radiator repair, secondary smelters and welding units. Urinary <b>Aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> has validity as a surrogate measure of blood lead level among workers occupationally exposed to lead. This study had therefore assessed the magnitude of lead exposure in battery repair workers of three transport service enterprises. Methods To this effect, a cross-sectional study was carried out on lead exposure among storage battery repair workers between November 2004 and May 2005 from Anbasa, Comet and Walia transport service enterprises, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Subjective information from the workers was obtained by making use of structured questionnaire. Other information was obtained from walkthrough evaluation of the repair units. <b>Aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> levels in urine were used as an index of the exposure. This was coupled to measurements of other relevant parameters in blood and urine collected from adult subjects working in the repair units as well as age matched control subjects that were not occupationally exposed to lead. <b>Aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> was determined by spectrophotometry, while creatinine clearance, serum creatinine, urea and uric acid levels were determined using AMS Autolab analyzer.
