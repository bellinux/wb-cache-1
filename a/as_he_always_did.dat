5|$|By October 1943, the fractious {{relationship}} came to {{the surface}} again. Galland met with Göring at Göring's estate, Schloss Veldenstein. During the conversation {{the need for new}} and improved interceptor aircraft arose. The demands made by Göring, that heavily cannon-armed fighters be used in mass numbers to defeat bomber formations, were unreasonable to Galland. Göring, prompted by the desires of Hitler, wanted cannons of some 2,000 lb in weight which fired at a rate of one shell per second. Galland explained that such a weapon could not be used effectively in an aircraft; the cannon would be prone to jamming and the aircraft would be too difficult to manoeuvre. Galland also asserted the use of inappropriate weaponry such as the Messerschmitt Me 410, a favourite of Hitler's, had caused heavy losses. Galland argued such measures were deplorable and irresponsible. Göring ignored Galland's arguments and continued his frequent attacks on the fighter force, accusing them of cowardice. Galland, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> defended them, risking his career and, {{near the end of the}} war, his life in doing so. Galland stated that he could not agree to follow Göring's plans and requested to be dismissed from his post and sent back to his unit. Göring accepted, but two weeks later he apologised to Galland and attributed his behaviour to stress. Galland continued in his post.|$|E

He had attended Mass that morning, receiving Communion <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> and spent {{the remainder of the}} morning at the hospital. Upon returning home he busied himself with patients until around three, after which, feeling tired, he sat down in an armchair in his office; soon after this, he died.|$|E

I went with her and when Kinau saw me he chased me <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did.</b> I think {{he did not like}} me. I ran to my grandmother and she protected me. Kuakini saw me and said to my grandmother to let the haole go and told us to [...] "hakaka" [...] (fight). She did and we fought. I beat him. Kuakini made fun of Kinau who was about six years old then.|$|E

2500|$|The opera premiered on 7 March 1896, and Sullivan {{conducted}} the orchestra, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> on opening nights. Costumes were by Percy Anderson. The opening {{night was a}} decided success, and the critics praised Gilbert's direction, Pálmay's singing and acting, Walter Passmore as Rudolph, and the cast in general. There were some reservations, however. [...] The Timess review of the opening night's performance said: ...|$|E
2500|$|Alec Skelding {{stood in}} 536 first class games. [...] His first game as umpire began on 9 May 1931 at New Road when he oversaw, Worcestershire CCC v Northamptonshire CCC. His final {{game in the}} white coat came when Leicestershire, {{appropriately}} enough, entertained Ireland at Grace Road. Of his contemporaries, only Frank Chester stood in more first-class games with 774, though David Constant has since eclipsed Skelding in second place. On 14 August 1959, for the very last time, he removed the bails with a theatrical flourish and announced, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> 'And that concludes the entertainment for the day, gentlemen.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Olaf Rye {{had ordered}} 2 of his 5 battalions {{to bypass the}} Treldeskansen (the fifth redoubt) {{so that they could}} block Schleswig-Holsteinian {{reinforcements}} from reaching it, whilst the remaining battalions of his brigade attacked the redoubt, supported by the batteries 'Marcussen' and 'Meincke'. [...] Rye, wanting to move forward to observe the assault better, rode on a horse towards the redoubt. [...] Riding unescorted, his horse was killed, and he went by foot to the 'Marcussen' battery where he got another one. [...] Riding north of the Treldeskansen with a company from the 4th Reserve Battalion, his new horse was shot. [...] Around 03:00, as he was leading his men from the front <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> he was shot in the thigh and in the lower abdomen, and died from his wounds a short time after.|$|E

2500|$|The Beauty Stone premiered at the Savoy Theatre on 28 May 1898. [...] Sullivan {{conducted}} the premiere, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> with his operas. [...] It closed on 16 July 1898 after {{a run of}} just 50 performances, making it the least successful of Sullivan's operas. [...] In contrast, the most successful shows that opened in London in 1898 had far longer runs: The Belle of New York (697 performances); A Greek Slave (349 performances); and A Runaway Girl (593 performances). [...] The cast of The Beauty Stone included Savoy regulars Walter Passmore, Rosina Brandram, Ruth Vincent, Emmie Owen and Henry Lytton. [...] Some of the music is more challenging than the typical Savoy Opera, and so Sullivan insisted on casting several opera singers, including Covent Garden opera soprano Pauline Joran as Saida (at an increased salary), {{and the size of}} the chorus was increased. [...] Choreography was by John D'Auban. Costumes by Percy Anderson and sets by William Telbin, Jr. (d. 1931) were universally praised by the critics.|$|E
2500|$|Churchill claimed, {{perhaps not}} {{directly}} discussing himself, that [...] "ometimes a slight and not unpleasing stammer or impediment {{has been of}} some assistance in securing {{the attention of the}} audience..." [...] However, those who knew Churchill and [...] on his stutter believed that it was or had been a significant problem for him. His secretary Phyllis Moir commented that [...] "Winston Churchill was born and grew up with a stutter" [...] in her 1941 book I was Winston Churchill's Private Secretary. She also noted about one incident [...] "It’s s s simply s s splendid" [...] he stuttered, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> when excited." [...] Louis J. Alber, who helped to arrange a lecture tour of the United States, wrote in Volume 55 of The American Mercury (1942) that [...] "Churchill struggled to express his feelings but his stutter caught him in the throat and his face turned purple" [...] and that [...] "born with a stutter and a lisp, both caused in large measure by a defect in his palate, Churchill was at first seriously hampered in his public speaking. It is characteristic of the man’s perseverance that, despite his staggering handicap, he made himself one of the greatest orators of our time." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Lord Hawke brought England to the {{continent}} in 1895/96, Rowe was selected for the 2nd and 3rd Test matches of the series. [...] In the first of these, played at the Old Wanderers Ground, at Johannesburg, {{not only did he}} bowl T.C. O’Brien with his second ball in Tests, he also distinguished himself with 5 wickets for 115 runs in England’s only innings. [...] Lord Hawke and England returned in 1898/99 and Rowe played in both Tests, taking a total of 7 for 186 as the visitors won the series. [...] Back in England with South Africa in 1901, he again shone, taking 136 wickets in all first-class matches at an average of 18.54. [...] On the way home from England in 1902, Australia stopped off at the Cape and played half-a-dozen matches during October and November. [...] Rowe was selected for one of the three Test matches but did little of note in a drawn game played at Johannesburg. [...] His best innings analysis was 8 for 25 (11 for 50 in the match) claimed at the expense of South-West Districts at Mossel Bay in 1904/05. [...] And his best match figures were 13 for 155 against Cambridge University at Fenner's on the 1901 tour. [...] He was nothing much of note as a batsman, playing <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> in the [...] "tail".|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 90s, Betty started dating Adam Chisholm. It was thought {{by some people}} that Betty had chosen Adam over Archie.

2500|$|... {{was part}} of a five-ship {{squadron}} under Edward Belcher sent from Britain in April 1852 to search for the missing British explorer Sir John Franklin, who had left Britain in 1845 in search of the fabled Northwest Passage through the Canadian Arctic. The Western Division of the squadron, consisting of HMS Resolute and HMS Intrepid under Captain Kellett's command, sailed West and wintered at Deally Island off Melville Island. The Eastern Division, consisting of HMS Assistance and Pioneer under Sir Edward Belcher's command, sailed North up the Wellington Channel and wintered near Northumberland Sound. The men spent the autumn of 1852, and {{the spring and summer of}} 1853 sledging across the Arctic in search of the Franklin Expedition, as well as the men on HMS Investigator (Captain Robert McClure), and HMS Enterprise (Captain Richard Collinson). [...] After finding and rescuing McClure and the crew of Investigator, Resolute and Intrepid sailed east, but had to winter in the pack ice, gradually moving East all winter. Belcher's two ships moved south in the Wellington Channel before being frozen in again near Disaster Bay. In the spring of 1854 Belcher ordered the abandonment of four of his five ships, and the men gathered at Beechey Island. Ironically, by the time they were ready to leave, both Assistance and Pioneer had broken free and had traveled 45 miles South in the Wellington Channel until they were only a few miles from Beechey Island. This made no difference to Belcher who was simply desperate to go home. Since he had made his two ships [...] "hells afloat" [...] <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> his men were also desperate to leave. However, Kellett only abandoned Resolute and Intrepid under protest. The officers and men returned home on HMS North Star and the relief ships HMS Phoenix and HMS Talbot.|$|E
