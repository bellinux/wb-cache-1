40|$|The <b>suction</b> <b>nozzle</b> of {{a vacuum}} cleaner was {{modified}} to enhance the power performance and to reduce the airf low-induced acoustic noise. The suction power efficiencies of the vacuum cleaner were measured for various nozzles: (1) original nozzle, (2) original nozzle with modified trench height, (3) original nozzle with modified connecting chamber, and (4) a combination of (2) and (3). In addition, the suction pressure and sound pressure level around the <b>suction</b> <b>nozzle</b> were measured to validate the reduction of acoustic noise. The power efficiency and mean suction pressure increased when the trench height of the <b>suction</b> <b>nozzle</b> was increased. This was attributed to {{the suppression of the}} flow separation in the suction channel.

Replacing the throttle valve with an ejector is an effective measure for recovering some of the energy lost in the expansion process.

Through optimizing the value of SNPD, the maximum COP of the ejector-expansion cycle can be up to 45. 1 % higher than that of the basic cycle.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{boundary}} layer with the airfoil profile, this research attempts to investigate {{the effect of the}} angle of spread of the winged <b>air</b> <b>suction</b> equipment on the efficiency of operation. The application of Fluent with the split-middle method under the identical operation mode is expected to optimize the spread angle. The investigated airfoil profile is NACA 6413, of which the restrictions on the critical angle of spread suggested in literature will be overcome through the interactions between the internal and external flow fields. As a result, the air speed might increase. The wind tunnel test employed in this research offers the solid evidences to support this hypothesis. The test demonstrates that when the angle of spread is larger than 12 °, the effect of accelerating the air flow is still observable.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Bacterial {{contamination}} of endoscopy suites is of concern; however studies evaluating bacterial aerosols are lacking. We aimed {{to determine the}} effectiveness of <b>air</b> <b>suctioning</b> during removal of biopsy forceps in reducing bacterial air contamination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective single-blinded trial involving 50 patients who were undergoing elective nontherapeutic colonoscopy. During colonoscopy, endoscopists removed the biopsy forceps first without and then with suctioning following contact with the sigmoid mucosa. A total of 50 L of air was collected continuously for 30 seconds at 30 -cm distance from the biopsy channel valve of the colonoscope, with time starting at forceps removal. Airborne bacteria were collected by an impactor air sampler (MAS- 100). Standard Petri dishes with CNA blood agar were used to culture Gram-positive bacteria. Main outcome measure was the bacterial load in endoscopy room air. RESULTS: At {{the beginning and end}} of the daily colonoscopy program, the median (and interquartile [IQR] range) bioaerosol burden was 4 colony forming units (CFU) /m (3) (IQR 3 - 6) and 16 CFU/m (3) (IQR 13 - 18), respectively. <b>Air</b> <b>suctioning</b> during removal of the biopsy forceps reduced the bioaerosol burden from a median of 14 CFU/m (3) (IQR 11 - 29) to a median of 7 CFU/m (3) (IQR 4 - 16) (P = 0. 0001). Predominantly enterococci were identified on the agar plates. CONCLUSION: The bacterial aerosol burden during handling of biopsy forceps can be reduced by applying <b>air</b> <b>suction</b> while removing the forceps.

40|$|The {{pneumatic}} conveying of bulk solid materials by {{the generation of}} a partial vacuum or negative pressure is the oldest form of conveying such materials through pipelines. It was developed approximately {{one hundred years ago}} to assist the rapid unloading of wheat grain from ships, barges and lighters in the London docks. However, the basic design of the device for entraining the bulk solid into the conveying pipeline has changed very little since those times. This thesis examines the effect of entrainment mechanisms in co-axial tube type <b>suction</b> <b>nozzles</b> on the performance of such conveying systems. The normal design of such nozzles is one where the inner conveying tube is retracted inside the outer tube. The work has demonstrated that with this configuration, high air velocities are necessary to effect entrainment of material beneath the nozzle into the conveying pipeline. By rearranging the nozzle so that the inner tube protrudes from the outer tube, a configuration can be obtained where, for free flowing products, the material flows readily under the action of gravity into the entraining airstream flowing down the annular chamber formed by the two tubes. The work has demonstrated that, for a given air flow rate, the product feed rate, and hence system throughput will be maximised by arranging these tubes such that the angle formed by them in the entrainment region is greater than the angle at which the product flows under the action of gravity into this region. Since a lower air flow rate and hence power consumption is required to achieve a given system throughput, this configuration has been identified as a more efficient entrainment mechanism than that associated with the usual configuration of <b>suction</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The effect of throttling the air flowing down the annular chamber on product entrainment into such nozzles is also identified and presented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Aeration is {{the process}} by which the area of contact between water and air is increased, either by natural methods or by {{mechanical}} devices. Proper aeration can make considerable improvements in a pond ecosystem. This paper investigates pond aeration by two phase flow systems such as high head gated conduit flow systems and two phase pipe flow systems using venturi tubes. When the gate of a high head outlet conduit is partly opened or a minimal amount of differential pressure exists between the inlet and outlet sides of the venturi tube, <b>air</b> <b>suction</b> occurs at <b>air</b> vents. In two phase flow systems, air that is entrained into the water will be momentarily forced downstream in the form of small air bubbles. The dissolution of oxygen into the water results from the <b>air</b> <b>suction</b> downstream of high head gated conduit and venturi tube, and the rising air bubbles into pond. Moreover, high pressure in two phase flow systems also facilitates the dissolution of oxygen into the water. Therefore, two phase flow systems have an extremely high efficiency for transferring oxygen from air bubbles to water.
