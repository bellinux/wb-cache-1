Its engine was mounted inside the front portion of the hull and the turret was mounted above the fighting compartment {{in the rear of}} the tank. Both Rheinmetall and Krupp produced prototypes, and in 1928, Rheinmetall was awarded the order of 289 tanks. However, some time later, the order was cancelled.

5000|$|Deep wading or {{deep fording}} is a {{technique}} used by some heavy semi-amphibious vehicles to traverse water that is several metres deep - the vehicle drives on the riverbed/lakebed/seabed and uses screens or a pipe (a snorkel) that reaches above the water surface for an air supply. The technique {{has been used by}} <b>armoured</b> <b>military</b> <b>vehicles</b> such as tanks and armored personnel carriers. Deep fording generally implies driving through water of such a depth that the vehicle is mostly or entirely submerged by the water, sometimes to several times the height of the vehicle itself, as well as a sealed crew compartment, complete with air supply for the crew. This makes it different from the less extreme [...] "wading" [...] done by many off-road vehicles which are simply fitted with a snorkel that is higher than the normal engine air intake, roughly level with the top of the cab. In these cases, the crew compartment is not watertight, and the snorkel provides air only for the engine. Thus maximum height is limited by the crew's need to breathe, and very rarely completely submerges the vehicle.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} the load of lower limbs of occupants in the <b>armoured</b> <b>military</b> <b>vehicle,</b> which has been destroyed by detonation of the Improvised Explosive Device (IED) charge under the vehicle. A simplified model of the human lower limb focused on upper ankle joint was developed {{in order to determine the}} reaction forces in joints and load in particular segments during the blast load. The model of upper ankle joint, include a tibia and an ankle bone with corresponding articular cartilage, has been developed. An analysis of the stress distribution under the influence of forces applied at different angles to the biomechanical axis of a limb has been performed. We analyzed the case of the lower limb of a sitting man leaning his feet on the floor. It has been shown that during a foot pronation induced by a knee outward deviation, the axial load on the foot causes significantly greater tension in the tibia. At the same time it has been shown that within the medial malleolus, tensile stresses occur on the surface of the bone which may lead to fracture of the medial malleolus. It is a common case of injuries caused by loads on foot of passengers in armored vehicles during a mine or IED load under the vehicle. It was shown that the outward deviation of the knee increases the risk of the foot injury within the ankle joint...|$|R

50|$|The {{remaining}} {{years that}} the company was in existence saw police cars based on such subjects as a Porsche 924 (430) and a Renault 5 (428), both in the white and black livery of the French Police nationale, a Mercedes 240D (412) and the Porsche 924 (430) in white and green of the German 'Polizei', and a blue Buick Regal (416) which had previously seen service as 'Kojak's' car. There was also a Metropolitan Police Land Rover and Horse box (GS44) complete with a model Police horse and rider, which was also available in Royal Canadian Mounted Police finish (GS45). 1982 the Ford Escort was released as a blue and white Police 'Panda' car (297). Ambulances were issued based on the Range Rover 'Vigilant' (482), a Mercedes-Benz W123 'Bonna' (406) in four different liveries for Scandinavian and German-speaking countries, and a Chevrolet Superior Ambulance (405). There appears, however, to have been a lack of fire fighting machinery released in this time, although the American LaFrance ladder truck and Simon Snorkel were still available along with the modern Chubb Pathfinder airport crash tender. Two models from this era do warrant attention. Riot Police Truck (422) released in September 1977 was a squat <b>armoured</b> <b>military</b> <b>vehicle</b> painted white and red with twin water cannons fitted to the rear, and perhaps reflected the turbulent times in Britain {{towards the end of the}} 1970s, and the Jaguar XJ12 Coupe which was released in December 1975 finished in the white and pale blue livery of the Coastguard (414), complete with die-cast light and twin foghorns on the roof. The model was updated as a police vehicle (429) in February 1978. In 1980 the first of the later 'Corgitronics' range was introduced: the HCB-Angus Firestreak (1001) with battery-operated siren and flashing red lights, complete with two figures in silver protective clothing.|$|R

5000|$|On 7 December 2015, the {{government}} of Syria announced that US-led coalition warplanes had fired nine missiles at its army camp near Ayyash, Deir al-Zour province, on the evening prior, killing three soldiers and wounding 13 others; three <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles,</b> four <b>military</b> <b>vehicles,</b> heavy machine-guns and an arms and ammunition depot were also destroyed.

Anonymous Pentagon officials alleged later in the day that the Pentagon was [...] "certain" [...] that a Russian warplane (presumably a TU-22 bomber) had carried out the attack.

40|$|A cross {{sectional}} {{study was conducted}} among <b>military</b> <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicle</b> drivers in the two largest mechanized battalions with the objective to determine the prevalence of low back pain (LBP), and its association with whole body vibration (WBV) and other associated factors. A self-administered questionnaire and Human Vibration Meter were used in this study. A total of 159 respondents {{participated in this study}} and 102 (64. 2 %) of them were subjected to WBV measurement. One-hundred-and–seventeen respondents complained of LBP for the past 12 months giving a prevalence of 73. 6 %. The prevalence of LBP among tracked armoured vehicle drivers was higher (81. 7 %) as compared to wheeled armoured vehicle drivers (67. 0 %). The mean acceleration at Z–axis in tracked armoured vehicles (1. 09 ± 0. 26 ms- 2) and wheeled armoured vehicles (0. 33 ± 0. 07 ms- 2) were the dominant vibration directions. The mean estimated vibration dose value (eVDV) for eight-hour daily exposure at Z–axis (19. 86 ± 4. 72 ms- 1. 75) in tracked armoured vehicles showed the highest estimation. Based on the European Vibration Directive (2002), the mean eVDV at Z–axis in tracked armoured vehicles exceeded exposure action value (EAV) (> 9. 1 ms- 1. 75), but did not exceed exposure limit value (ELV) (< 21. 0 ms- 1. 75). Logistic regression analysis revealed that only driving in forward bending sitting posture (OR= 3. 63, 95 % CI 1. 06 – 12. 42) and WBV exposure at X-axis (OR= 1. 94, 95 % CI 1. 02 – 3. 69) were significant risk factors to LBP. Preventive measures should be implemented to minimize risk of WBV and to improve ergonomic postures among drivers.

50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1931 by Walter C. Marmon and Arthur W. Herrington and focused on {{building}} all-wheel-drive trucks. It was the successor to the Marmon Motor Car Company, a maker of automobiles from 1902 to 1933. Marmon-Herrington (MH) {{got off to a}} successful start by procuring contracts for military aircraft refueling trucks, 4x4 chassis for towing light weaponry, commercial aircraft refueling trucks, and an order from the Iraqi Pipeline Company for what were the largest trucks ever built at the time. Construction of all-wheel-drive (AWD) vehicles and conversion of existing vehicles to AWD were among the company's products. Marmon-Herrington also made multi-stop delivery vans and passenger vehicles. The company designed a <b>military</b> <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicle</b> which could be constructed on a commercial truck chassis.
