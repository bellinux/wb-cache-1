40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{differences between}} pharmacy practice faculty and departmental chairpersons {{with regard to}} scholarly performance and variables hypothesized as being related to scholarly performance. Also reported are factors that faculty members and chairpersons perceive to inhibit their scholarly performance. The chairpersons were older, had more experience, {{and were more likely}} to be tenured or hold a tenure track position. The workload of the chairpersons differed from that of the faculty in that they spent a larger amount of time in administrative activities and less in clinical practice and clerkship teaching. They spent less time in research than did the faculty (16 versus 20 percent), but the difference was not significant. The chairpersons viewed their departmental environment as much more supportive than did their faculty and were more satisfied with the resources available to them than were their faculty. The chairs perceived themselves as providing higher levels of faculty support compared to the perceptions of their faculty. The chairpersons and faculty produced essentially the same amount of scholarly work. The faculty and departmental chairpersons cited a number of factors which they felt inhibited their scholarly performance. These included lack of time, heavy commitments to other activities which prevented time for research, lack of resources, and lack of research skills, <b>abilities,</b> <b>or</b> <b>training.</b> The implications of the study findings are discussed...|$|E
50|$|Characters {{have a set}} of Attributes, Powers, and Skills. Attributes are {{the nine}} qualities every {{character}} has. Powers and Skills reflect innate <b>ability</b> <b>or</b> <b>training.</b> Attributes are divided into three categories (Physical, Mental, and Spiritual) and three attribute types (Action, Effect, and Resistance). For example, when Superman punches someone, he uses Dexterity to see if he connects, Strength to see how hard he hits, and the opposing character's Body to see how much damage he did. The value of a Power usually serves as both Active Value (AV) and Effect Value (EV) resisted by the target's Resistance Value (RV). All actions taken, even against inanimate objects, use that system. For example, investigators use AV and EV against a RV to determine the quality of information their efforts gather.|$|R

Research issues include identifying how to extend this approach to dynamically-generated courseware content, e. g., graphic simulations, and determining the educational effectiveness of various control algorithms used to assign students to problem sets of different levels of difficulty...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this project}} was to analyze and compare the {{educational}} experience in rheumatology specialty training programs across European countries, {{with a focus on}} self-reported ability. [...] - METHOD: An electronic survey was designed to assess the training experience in terms of self-reported ability, existence of formal education, number of patients managed and assessments performed during rheumatology training in 21 core competences including managing specific diseases, generic competences and procedures. The target population consisted of rheumatology trainees and recently certified rheumatologists across Europe. The relationship between the country of training and the self-reported <b>ability</b> <b>or</b> <b>training</b> methods for each competence was analyzed through linear or logistic regression, as appropriate. [...] - RESULTS: In total 1079 questionnaires from 41 countries were gathered. Self-reported ability was high for most competences, range 7. 5 - 9. 4 (0 - 10 scale) for clinical competences, 5. 8 - 9. 0 for technical procedures and 7. 8 - 8. 9 for generic competences. Competences with lower self-reported ability included managing patients with vasculitis, identifying crystals and performing an ultrasound. Between 53 and 91...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to explore the {{possibility}} of providing useful tools for numerically solving scientific problems in an on-line environment. The develop-ment of such tools is then exemplified by interactive systems written for an IBM 2250 display console (CRT). Least squares data-fitting and the related problem of numerical functional minimization is chosen {{as an example of}} a problem area which can benefit from on-line graphical interaction. Interactive systems can be designed for various levels of user sophistication. A system that can be useful to persons with any level of programming <b>ability</b> <b>or</b> <b>training</b> has to be designed to lead a user through the problem solving process. This can be accomplished by allowing the user to select from various options at each stage in the problem solution rather than requiring him to specify steps to the computer. The desim of PEG, an on-line least squares data-fitting program, embodies this easy-to-use design philosophy. Several other aspects of the design of interactive systems are discussed and exemplified by the design of PEG. PEG is related to other existing and proposed systems for on-line solution o...|$|R

This paper {{presents}} a methodology for automatically customizing a scenario to suit a learner’s <b>abilities,</b> needs, <b>or</b> goals. <b>Training</b> scenarios are often utilized to give learners hands-on experience with real-life problem solving tasks. The customization of scenarios {{has the potential}} to improve learning gains within these domains. We present initial steps toward an intelligent technology called a Scenario Adaptor that employs a partial order planning formalism to reason about learning objectives and causality, and we discuss how the Scenario Adaptor may add or delete learning objectives from a scenario. 1...|$|R
30|$|A first {{explanation}} {{refers to}} the assumption that, to begin with, entry-level workers might have jobs {{for which they are}} overeducated and later on move to jobs that better match their educational attainment. In their overview studies, Leuven and Oosterbeek (2011) and Cedefop (2010) conclude that, according to many studies, younger workers {{are more likely to be}} overeducated than older workers. This supports the assumption that overeducation is part of an adaptation process in the early stages of a working career, in which it compensates for the lack of other human capital endowments, such as <b>ability,</b> experience <b>or</b> on-the-job <b>training.</b> Following this explanation, we investigated job allocation frictions in our empirical study by testing the assumption that the incidence of overeducation is higher among workers who have recently entered the labour market.|$|R
40|$|Introduction : Despite their {{relatively}} low area coverage, riparian forests are central landscape features providing several ecosystem services. Nevertheless, they are critically endangered in European countries by human pressures (livestock grazing, land use conflicts, canalizations, waste water, [...] .) andalso by natural hazards {{such as the}} recent black alder (Alnus glutinosa) extensive decline caused by Phytophthora alni. In this study UAV is used to improve the characterization of riparian areas. Riparian forest species are identified at the individual tree level. The health condition of black alder is assessed. For this purpose a computer based approach has been developped, with low needs of specific operator <b>ability</b> <b>or</b> <b>training.</b> Methods : We used the Gatewing X 100 to acquire 16 aerial photographs datasets (7 in classic RGB and 9 in RG NIR) during 5 days (form Augustus to October 2012). We processed a CHM in ArcGIS by combining a national Digital Terrain Model with a photogrammetric DSM generated from a single flight photographs dataset with the "MicMac" opensource platform. The 16 orthophotos were computed with Agisoft Photoscan. Based on the CHM and some basic vegetation index (mean NDVI), a classification/segmentation process was developped in eCognition allowing tree crown extraction. An amount of 113 metrics were computed in eCognition for every tree crown object. The metrics were both derived from the CHM raster and spectral information. Metrics were computed by band (object spectral mean and CHM mean, Harralick entropy, Skewness) but also with band combination (Green NDVI and NDVI). A reference dataset was also acquired through a field survey of 624 individual tree positions accurately localized. The health condition of the black alder was recorded during the field survey. A supervised classification algorithm was developed in R (Random Forest package). Results : Several classification trees were assessed trough global accuracy using the Out Of Bag (OOB) error. The best global accuracy (82 %) was obtained when distinguishing the black alder (with no regards for health condition during field survey) {{from the rest of}} riparian forest objects. The global accuracy tended to decline when other species were added. When separating healthy black alders from those with symptoms, the global accuracy is 77 %. Conclusions : Our study highlights the potential of UAV-based multitemporal orthophotos to identify riparian forest species and health conditions at the tree level. Future studies will focus on quick radiometrics corrections. This could improve global accuracy by reducing the variability caused by illumination condition...|$|R
50|$|When the Moguls ruled {{northern}} India in {{the early}} 16th century they used Turkoman horses to supplement the breeding of these local Marwari horses. During the late 16th century, the Moghul emperor Akbar, retained a cavalry force of 50,000 strong. It was believed that these local Marwari horses would only leave a battlefield under one of three conditions - victory, death, or carrying a wounded master to safety. The horses were trained to be extremely responsive in battlefield conditions, and were practised in complex riding maneuvers. When the British took over India it was essential that this ability {{was removed from the}} natives. Further, they enacted Criminal Tribes Act to prevent the established warriors from training and breeding these horses. They also passed laws preventing the native Gentry and Noblemen land owning rights, removing their <b>ability</b> to maintain <b>or</b> <b>train</b> cavalry. It was only 300 years later, during the First World War, Marwar lancers under Sir Pratap Singh assisted the British.|$|R

The non-deaf people are easy to use Email techniques to communicate with other people. Thus, they cannot understand how difficult a deaf people studies the nature language. As to deaf-people, the condition is totally different. They have a hard time to write a good sentence because of their limited vocabulary capabilities and language skills. The poor language capability such as limited vocabulary <b>ability</b> <b>or</b> poor syntax <b>training</b> for a deaf people is because most deaf people cannot listen and practice the basic language techniques. When they read a sentence, they always translate by vocabulary and guess the meaning of the whole sentence. They don’t really understand the whole sentence. Therefore, they are difficult to read a text article, to write a composition, or even a short mail. The Education Bureau of Taiwan has defined the standard of sign language recently. In this paper, we propose a method to convert Chinese words or texts to a speech and sign language simultaneously. A deaf people can easily read an Email or article by a translated sign language stream. On the contrary, a non-deaf people can read the Email by listening the conversion speech...|$|R
40|$|There is much {{speculation}} about the average person’s ability to use a fire extinguisher effectively. This speculation includes {{the ability of a}} novice user to adequately extinguish a fire with a fire extinguisher without harming oneself or others. This study employed a random sampling of the population to gather data that described and quantified several aspects relating to use, technique, and safety. Participants were presented with an extinguisher and asked to extinguish a controlled propane fire. The BullEx Intelligent Training System was used in this study to simulate a Class A fire through a controlled propane system. Participants were recruited from the campuses of Worcester Polytechnic Institute and Eastern Kentucky University. The sample pool consisted of 276 participants who participated in a two-trial process. The first trial observed the participant’s ability to use a fire extinguisher without any <b>training</b> <b>or</b> guidance from the investigators. The second trial observed the participant’s ability to use a fire extinguisher {{with a small amount of}} training provided immediately after the first trial.
