5|$|According to {{accounts}} from his life, he preached {{the importance of}} realization of the self, and criticized love towards perishable things. His teachings concentrate on a moral code of love, forgiveness, helping others, charity, contentment, inner peace, <b>and</b> <b>devotion</b> to the God and guru. He {{stressed the importance of}} surrender to the true Satguru, who, having trod the path to divine consciousness, will lead the disciple through the jungle of spiritual training.|$|E
5|$|Although largely {{faithful}} to {{a selection of}} historical facts, the film has drawn criticism for embellishing on events {{in order to increase}} dramatic potential. For example, Prince Albert was never shot during an assassination attempt on Queen Victoria. Fellowes told BBC Radio 4's Film Programme that in actuality the prince did put his body before the queen as protection, and that showing Prince Albert having been grazed by the bullet in the film was added to best show his bravery <b>and</b> <b>devotion</b> as he tried to stop Queen Victoria from being shot.|$|E
5|$|At {{his death}} in 1799 he left a {{critical}} legacy; he exemplified the core ideals of the American Revolution and the new nation: republican virtue <b>and</b> <b>devotion</b> to civic duty. Washington was the unchallenged public icon of American military and civic patriotism. He was also identified with the Federalist Party, which {{lost control of the}} national government in 1800 to the Jeffersonian Republicans, who were reluctant to celebrate the hero of the opposition party.|$|E

Narendra gradually grew ready to renounce everything for the sake of realising God, and accepted Ramakrishna as his Guru.|$|E

5|$|For {{exceptionally}} meritorious {{conduct in}} the performance of outstanding service while serving on board the U.S.S. TRITON from 16 February 1960 to 10 May 1960. As Commanding Officer, Captain Edward L. Beach, United States Navy, led his crew with courage, foresight and determination in an unprecedented circumnavigation of the globe, proving man's ability under trying conditions to accomplish prolonged submerged missions as well as testing new and complex equipment in the world's largest submarine. This historic voyage took his ship into strange waters under difficult and frequently unknown conditions, as a result, the TRITON collected much valuable oceanographic information. Captain Beach's sound judgment, masterful leadership, professional skill <b>and</b> <b>devotion</b> to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the naval service.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Hobbs met Ada Ellen Gates, a cobbler's daughter, at {{an evening}} church service held in St Matthew's, Cambridge. The {{progress}} {{of their relationship}} was slowed by Hobbs' shyness <b>and</b> <b>devotion</b> to cricket, but the pair eventually married on 26 September 1906 at the church in which they met. They planned to keep the event quiet, but it {{was reported in the}} press and the couple received gifts and messages from Hobbs' Surrey team-mates. Hobbs so disliked being separated from his wife during cricket tours that in later years she often accompanied the team overseas. They had four children: Jack, born in 1907, Leonard in 1909, Vera in 1913 and Ivor in 1914.|$|E
5|$|Mahatma Gandhi's life {{achievement}} stands {{unique in}} political history.

Because lasting will only {{be the work of}} such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and educational works. We may all be happy and grateful that destiny gifted us with such an enlightened contemporary, a role model for the generations to come.|$|E

5|$|The PDSA Gold Medal is {{an animal}} bravery award that {{acknowledges}} the bravery <b>and</b> <b>devotion</b> to duty of animals. It {{was created by}} the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA) in 2001, and is now recognised as the animal equivalent of the George Cross.

In personal command of the FIRST Marine Raider Battalion during the initial operation, Colonel Edson advanced the attack of his Battalion and its supporting units with such skill, courage and aggressiveness that he was an inspiration to the entire Combat Group and was directly responsible for the capture of Tulagi Island. His gallant conduct throughout this hazardous action was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E
5|$|Before the 12th century, Jain writers had {{dominated}} Kannada literature {{with their}} champu (verses mixed with prose) style of writings popular in court literature. In the later medieval period, {{they had to}} contend with the Veerashaivas who challenged the very notion of royal literature with their vachana poetry, a stylised form of spoken language, more popular in folk genres. The popular growth of Veerashaiva (devotees of the Hindu god Shiva) literature began in the 12th century, while Vaishnava (devotees of the Hindu god Vishnu) writers began to exert their influence from the 15th century. Jain writers had to reinvent their art, moving away from the traditional themes of renunciation and tenets to focus on contemporary topics. Andayya's 13th century classic Kabbigara Kava ("Poets defender") was an early example of the change in literary style, and also reflected the hostility toward the Veerashaivas; the Jain author found it ideal to narrate the story of Manmatha, the God of Love, who turned Shiva into a half woman. The Veerashaivas had initiated an important change, casting aside the concept of formal literature and making way for shorter local genres. The Vaishnava haridasas later popularised musical forms that were more acceptable to the common man. Written classics eulogising kings and commanders were a thing of the past. Kannada literature had moved closer to the spoken and sung folk traditions, with singability being its hallmark, <b>and</b> <b>devotion</b> to God its goal.|$|E
