Here it meets the San Bernardino Freeway (I-10) and Chino Valley Freeway (SR 71) at the four-level Kellogg Hill Interchange. In the north half of that interchange, SR57 enters the San Jose Hills, climbing to its highest elevation before descending back into the connected San Gabriel and Pomona Valleys and ending at the Glendora Curve interchange with the Foothill Freeway (I-210) in Glendora.|$|E

5|$|British Rail {{was split}} into business-led sectors in the 1980s, {{at which time}} {{operations}} at Yatton passed to Regional Railways.

5|$|In {{the course}} of normal immune response, parts of {{pathogens}} (e.g. bacteria) are recognized by the immune system as foreign (non-self), and eliminated or effectively neutralized to reduce their potential damage. Such a recognizable substance is called an antigen. The immune system may respond in multiple ways to an antigen; a key feature of this response is the production of antibodies by B cells (or B lymphocytes) involving <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> the immune system known as humoral immunity. The antibodies are soluble and do not require direct cell-to-cell contact between the pathogen and the B-cell to function.|$|E
5|$|Jarlshof lies {{near the}} {{southern}} tip of the Shetland Mainland, close to the settlements of Sumburgh and Grutness and to the south end of Sumburgh Airport. The site overlooks <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> the sea called the West Voe of Sumburgh and the nearby freshwater springs and building materials available on the beach will have added to the location's attraction as a settlement. The south Mainland also provides a favourable location for arable cultivation in a Shetland context and there is a high density of prehistoric settlement in the surrounding area. Jarlshof is only one mile from Scatness where the remains of another broch and other ruins of a similar longevity were discovered in 1975. There is a small visitor centre at Jarlshof with displays and a collection of artefacts.|$|E

5|$|Richard de Rulos, who was Lord of Deeping Fen {{during the}} reign of William the Conqueror erected a strong {{embankment}} to prevent flooding of the meadows adjoining the river, which then became fertile fields and a pleasure garden. During the reign of Henry III (1207–1272), complaints were made that of the two channels below Crowland, the one to Spalding was more favourable to the passage of barges, but the Abbot of Crowland had obstructed and narrowed its course by planting willow trees. In the fourteenth century, Spalding was charged with failing to scour and repair the river, causing damage to the king's liege people, but argued that because it was tidal at this point, it was <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> the sea, and so they were not responsible.|$|E
5|$|Seattle {{is located}} between the {{saltwater}} Puget Sound (<b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> the Pacific Ocean) {{to the west}} and Lake Washington to the east. The city's chief harbor, Elliott Bay, is part of Puget Sound, which makes the city an oceanic port. To the west, beyond Puget Sound, are the Kitsap Peninsula and Olympic Mountains on the Olympic Peninsula; to the east, beyond Lake Washington and the Eastside suburbs, are Lake Sammamish and the Cascade Range. Lake Washington's waters flow to Puget Sound through the Lake Washington Ship Canal (consisting of two man-made canals, Lake Union, and the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks at Salmon Bay, ending in Shilshole Bay on Puget Sound).|$|E

To the east is <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> Loch Linnhe known as the Lynn of Lorn. Composed almost entirely of Dalradian limestone with interbedded black slate, Lismore has fertile soil and an abundance of trees and shrubs including ash and sycamore. The topography consists of sheltered furrows of land between raised areas that run longitudinally up the island's spine.|$|E

Running due east through farmlands in the {{southern}} area of that county, the highway intersects MN4 in Cosmos and passes through Cedar Mills. Just east of Cedar Mills, MN7 crosses into McLeod County and merges with MN22. The combined highway turns southeasterly toward Hutchinson. On {{the west side of}} town, the roadway crosses Campbell Lake and follows <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> the lake through the downtown area. The highway passes several parks before coming to an intersection with MN15 and exiting the business district for residential neighborhoods. MN22 separates from MN7 east of Hutchinson, and the latter highway continues eastward.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{privatisation}} of British Rail in 1997, {{services were}} franchised to Wales & West, {{which was in}} turn succeeded in 2001 by Wessex Trains, <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> National Express. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western, a subsidiary company of FirstGroup, which was later rebranded Great Western Railway. Great Western Railway services to and from London Paddington started calling at Worle in 2007. Due to the trains being longer than the platforms, a selective door opening system was used to prevent passengers opening doors which were not adjacent to the platform.|$|E

5|$|When {{the railway}} was privatised in 1997, local {{services}} were franchised to Wales & West, which was succeeded by Wessex Trains, <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> National Express, in 2001. The line through Filton closed {{for two weeks}} in June 2004 to enable {{the construction of a}} new platform and third running line on the west side of the station, separating trains towards Bristol Parkway from trains towards Wales before the station, and so allowing through-trains to pass stopping trains. The project cost £16,000,000, and caused the complete suspension of Severn Beach Line services to allow longer-distance services to use it as a diversion.|$|E
5|$|British Rail {{was split}} into business-led sectors in the 1980s, {{at which time}} {{operations}} at Stapleton Road passed to Regional Railways. All trains along the Severn Beach Line ran to Severn Beach, but the service pattern was irregular. This was changed in the mid-1990s, with a more frequent service to Avonmouth but very few on to Severn Beach and no Sunday services. When the railway was privatised in 1997, local services were franchised to Wales & West, which was succeeded by Wessex Trains, <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> National Express, in 2001. Services along the Severn Beach Line were increased to 10 per day in each direction by 2005, with Bristol City Council providing a subsidy to Wessex Trains. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western, a subsidiary company of FirstGroup, which was rebranded in 2015 as Great Western Railway. A minimum service requirement was written into the franchise agreement, ensuring an hourly service along the Severn Beach Line. Passenger traffic increased significantly, and in 2010, Sunday services to Severn Beach were restored.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 18th century, with {{the lines between}} {{commercial}} and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts. The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly flex its military muscle and caused it to become attractive to {{a portion of the}} Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies. Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s. India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials, and many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period. By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and effectively having been made <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> British administration, the company began to more consciously enter non-economic arenas such as education, social reform, and culture.|$|E
