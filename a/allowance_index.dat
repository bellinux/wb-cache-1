40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the digestibility of cashew bagasse bran as well as the performance of swine fed diets with different levels of inclusion of this by-product and their economic viability. In the digestibility trial, ten crossbred barrows weighing 60 ± 6. 86 kg were housed in metabolic cages. Five received standard feed and five received test feed with 300 g kg− 1 cashew bagasse bran included. For the performance and economic viability study, forty crossbred pigs weighing 60 ± 5. 24 kg were allotted in a randomized block design with five treatments (0, 75, 150, 225, and 300 g kg− 1 inclusion of cashew bagasse bran) and four replications. Daily feed intake, daily gain, feed conversion, partial gross income with and without <b>allowance</b> <b>index,</b> and partial net income with and without <b>allowance</b> <b>index</b> were evaluated. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and regression analysis. The treatment with 75 g kg− 1 cashew bagasse bran provided the best results. Cashew bagasse bran can be included in the diet of finishing pigs up to the level of 300 g kg− 1 without adversely affecting animal performance...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to evaluate the performance, carcass composition, cutting yields and economic viability of 5 or 10 ppm of ractopamine hydrochloride (RAC) in diets for barrows and gilts from 94 to 130 kg. Sixty commercial hybrid pigs within a gender, were individually kept in pens and assigned a randomized experimental block design, in a 3 &# 215; 2 factorial arrangement, with three levels of RAC (0; 5 and 10 ppm) and two sexs (barrows and gilts). There were no RAC &# 215; sex interactions for all evaluated parameters. There were significant improvements for the groups of RAC-treated on final weight, average daily gain (ADG) and feed:gain (F:G). The RAC, independent from the level (5 or 10 ppm), improved the F:G, but did not influence the average feed intake. The gilts had smaller final weight, smaller average feed intake and better F:G. The supplementation with 10 ppm of RAC provided better carcass yield, better longissimus muscle area and better meat percentage. The pigs supplemented with RAC showed better tenderloin yield, better ham weight and better meat percentage of ham. The gilts had better meat percentage, better back fat thickness, bigger belly flexibility and smaller fat thickness of the belly than barrows. On economic viability, the RAC-treated pigs increased the <b>allowance</b> <b>index,</b> gross earnings and net earnings. Compared to the barrows, gilts showed lower total cost, better <b>allowance</b> <b>index</b> and higher net earnings. The supplementation with 5 ppm of RAC was enough to improve performance, carcass composition and cutting yields in the heavy pigs. Furthermore, 5 or 10 ppm of RAC was economically viable and the heavy gilts were more profitable than heavy barrows...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{research}} was to study the brown bear presence {{in relation to the}} landscape pattern, expressed in terms of energy flows, through the quantification of the energetic values and meaning of the natural (biotic and a biotic) and human-related (road networks, settlements, etc.) landscape components. These values were correlated to the estimation of the energy requirements of the bears monitored with GPS techniques (n= 4, males) and to the their presence and behavior. The spatial model of energetic values for landscape components have been developed by GIS technology and in the respect to the ecological requirements of brown bear in the central and north east alps (North of Italy, Slovenja and Austria). Data sources were public databases as Corine Land Cover project (UE), Carta della Natura Project (ISPRA) Digital Terrain Model. The spatial resolutions utilized was 1 km 2 and the UTM grid was used. For each quadrant was calculated: habitat cover, geomorphology, human presence, brightness (solar radiation corrected for the tree cover) feeding allowance (food <b>allowance</b> <b>index,</b> IDA), climate (Modis), and energy values expressed as estimation of the potential cost of locomotion, thermoregulation, feeding, resting (output) and as potential energy of food allowance (input). For each animals tracked by telemetry were estimated the energy requirements in relation to the cost of basal metabolism,. thermoregulation, locomotion, feeding for each utilized quadrants and compared to the utilized quadrants and in the respect to different level of utilization. The identification and development of landscape indexes, describing many environmental components with implications on animal energy requirements, has been coupled with a behavioral pattern analysis and the computation of animal energy outcomes and incomes. The obtained thematic maps showed the spatial distribution of these input and output: thought them it is possible make habitat characterizations showing potential satisfaction level in terms of ecological requirements for the Brown bear and obtain useful information for defining the habitat energetic suitability at the trans regional scale. This study has revealed several emergent diurnal-nocturnal and seasonal energetic patterns in the use of landscape resources, and has allowed the implementation of some spatially explicit models for the estimation of energy inputs and outputs; the cost of thermoregulation and locomotion (output) and the potential allowance of energy (input), seems to influence the use of landscape and bear behavior. The future development of this research through the use of other individual location datasets (also belonging to different geographical contexts) may allow to refine the approach and identify more precisely the key spatial variables to be measured in terms of energy, as well as to apply this approach to more sophisticated models like IBMs (Individual Based Models) ...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. In June 1995, an unexpected decrease in COLA index on the Kanto Plain of Japan, {{to include the}} Yokosuka area, caused concern amongst service members stationed in this area. The purchasing power of the dollar was in decline {{when compared to the}} yen and all other economic indicators {{at the time of the}} COLA decrease suggested that the COLA index should have increased or at least remained constant. What explains the apparent inconsistency between the declining value of the dollar relative to the yen and the concurrent decrease in COLA provided to service members? This thesis conducted a critical analysis of the procedures and methods used by the Per Diem, Travel and Transportation Allowance Commiflee (PDTATAC) to calculate the cost of living <b>allowance</b> (COLA) <b>index</b> and determine the cause and effect of the June 1995 decrease in COLA index. This thesis addressed the policies of the COLA system, utilizing both historical data and a stylized model, to determine if they are equitable from an economic standpoint. The analysis revealed that the Living Pattern Survey (LPS) was a viable tool to obtain information on where service members made purchases, if exchange rates were stable. If exchange rates were increasing, the LPS prevented overpayment of service members. If exchange rates were declining, the LPS reduced the 'purchasing power' of service members[URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} near-term effects on {{household}} expenditures of legislative cap-and-trade proposals that restrict greenhouse gas emissions. We evaluate optimistic and pessimistic {{assumptions about the}} uses of allowance value, compared to relatively predictable results from a cap-and-dividend approach. We find the allocation of emissions allowances is significantly more important to distributional outcomes than the initial costs or regional variation of costs. Older households—age 65 and older—incur relatively less cost than other age groups due to automatic inflation indexing of Social Security. Lowincome households spend a larger fraction of earnings on energy than wealthier households; however, the distribution of <b>allowance</b> value and <b>indexing</b> of government programs offset this spending. High-income households fare well because of allowance value that ultimately flows to capital owners. The largest burden {{as a percentage of}} income falls on middle-income households, which receive neither low-income rebates nor value through ownership of capital stock...|$|R
40|$|Defining ecologically {{relevant}} {{upper temperature}} limits of species {{is important in}} the context of environmental change. The approach used in the present paper estimates the relationship between rates of temperature change and upper temperature limits for survival in order to evaluate the maximum long-term survival temperature (Ts). This new approach integrates both the exposure time and the exposure temperature in the evaluation of temperature limits. Using data previously published for different temperate and Antarctic marine environments, we calculated Ts in each environment, which allowed us to calculate a new index: the Warming <b>Allowance</b> (WA). This <b>index</b> is defined as the maximum environmental temperature increase which an ectotherm in a given environment can tolerate, possibly with a decrease in performance but without endangering survival over seasonal or lifetime time-scales. It is calculated as the difference between maximum long-term survival temperature (Ts) and mean maximum habitat temperature. It provides a measure of how close a species, assemblage or fauna are living to their temperature limits for long-term survival and hence their vulnerability to environmental warming. In contrast to data for terrestrial environments showing that warming tolerance increases with latitude, results here for marine environments show a less clear pattern as the smallest WA value was for the Peru upwelling system. The method applied here, relating upper temperature limits to rate of experimental warming, ha...|$|R
40|$|An indexed unit of {{account is}} a unit of {{measurement}} defined using an index such as a consumer price index so that prices, wages or deferred payments {{defined in terms of}} these units will automatically adjust to changing economic conditions. Evidence on money illusion and sticky prices, and evidence from countries (notably Chile) that have created indexed units of account, suggests that creating such indexed units is an important policy option for governments in countries with unstable prices or incomes. Choices for governments designing indexed units of account are discussed. Governments may choose to encourage the use of the units only for large long-deferred non-wage payments, or they may choose to go to the opposite extreme of encouraging the use of the units for defining all prices, wages and payments. A general equilibrium model is given that shows the dynamics of prices when all prices are expressed in the units. Governments may choose to link units to a consumer price index or to a per capita income index, and there may be advantages to creating both kinds of units simultaneously. Downward rigidity of real wages might be reduced if wages are denominated in base-income-indexed units of account, where base income is defined so that the growth rate in money value of the unit is biased down relative to actual per capita income growth. Examples of the units for United States are displayed and discussed. Could add description of simulation, if that is added.
