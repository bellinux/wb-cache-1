5000|$|To anneal glass, it is {{necessary}} to heat it to its annealing temperature, at which its viscosity, η, drops to 1013 Poise ("Poise" [...] is a measure of absolute viscosity; 1 poise = 1 dyne-second/cm²). For most kinds of glass, this annealing temperature is in the range of 850-900 °F (454 - 482 °C), and is the so-called stress-relief point or <b>annealing</b> <b>point</b> of the glass. At such a viscosity, the glass still is too hard for significant external deformation without breaking, but it is soft enough to relax internal strains by microscopic flow in response to the intense stresses they introduce internally. The piece then heat-soaks until its temperature is even throughout and the stress relaxation is adequate. The time necessary for this step varies {{depending on the type of}} glass and its maximum thickness. The glass then is permitted to cool at a predetermined rate until its temperature passes the strain point (η = 1014.5 Poise), below which even microscopic internal flow effectively stops and annealing stops with it. It then is safe to cool the product to room temperature at a rate limited by the heat capacity, thickness, thermal conductivity, and thermal expansion coefficient of the glass. After annealing is complete the material can be cut to size, drilled, or polished without risk of its internal stresses shattering it.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{critical}} point of directed pinning/wetting models with quenched disorder. The distribution K(.) {{of the location}} of the first contact of the (free) polymer with the defect line is assumed to be of the form K(n) =n^-α- 1 L(n), with L(.) slowly varying. The model undergoes a (de) -localization phase transition: the free energy (per unit length) is zero in the delocalized phase and positive in the localized phase. For α< 1 / 2 it is known that disorder is irrelevant: quenched and <b>annealed</b> critical <b>points</b> coincide for small disorder, as well as quenched and annealed critical exponents. The same has been proven also for α= 1 / 2, but under the assumption that L(.) diverges sufficiently fast at infinity, an hypothesis that is not satisfied in the (1 + 1) -dimensional wetting model considered by Forgacs et al. (1986) and Derrida et al. (1992), where L(.) is asymptotically constant. Here we prove that, if 1 / 2 1, then quenched and <b>annealed</b> critical <b>points</b> differ whenever disorder is present, and we give the scaling form of their difference for small disorder. In agreement with the so-called Harris criterion, disorder is therefore relevant in this case. In the marginal case α= 1 / 2, under the assumption that L(.) vanishes sufficiently fast at infinity, we prove that the difference between quenched and <b>annealed</b> critical <b>points,</b> which is known to be smaller than any power of the disorder strength, is positive: disorder is marginally relevant. Again, the case considered by Forgacs et al. (1986) and Derrida et al. (1992) is out of our analysis and remains open. Comment: 20 pages, 1 figure; v 2 : few typos corrected, references revised.
