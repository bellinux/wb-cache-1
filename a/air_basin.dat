DISCUSSldN: Health and Safety Code (H&SC) section 39610 directs the Air Resources Board (Board) to identify upwind <b>air</b> <b>basins</b> that cause or contribute to violations of the State ozone standard in downwind areas and to assess the relative contributions of upwind emissions. This report proposes to amend the transport identification regulation (California Code of Regulations, title 17, section 70500 (c)) and to make conforming notational changes to the transport mitigation regulation (California Code of Regulations, title 17, section 70600). The-identification regulation lists the upwind and downwind areas that are the origin and destination of transported air contaminants referred to as “transport couples. ” The transport mitigation regulation requires <b>air</b> <b>basins</b> which are identified as upwind areas in the transport identification regulation to adopt best available retrofit control technology, as defined in Health and Safety Code section 40406, on all existing stationary sources of ozone precursor emissions. In addition, <b>air</b> <b>basins</b> that are classified as causing “overwhelming ” transport must adopt sufficient control measures to attain the State ozone standard in the downwind areas when conditions are conducive to “overwhelming” transport. 102 Based on the available data, the ARB staff recommends that two new transport couples be added to the transport identification regulation: the San Francisco Bay.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} sought to {{determine}} if there is an association between air quality and acute deaths. Many consider it plausible that current levels of air quality cause acute deaths. However, several factors call causation and even association into question. Observational data sets are large and complex. Multiple testing and multiple modeling can lead to false positive findings. Publication, confirmation and other biases are also possible problems. Moreover, the fact that most data sets used in studies evaluating the relationships among air quality and public health outcomes are not publicly available makes reproducing the claims nearly impossible. Here we have built and made publicly available a dataset containing daily air quality levels, PM 2. 5 and ozone, daily temperature levels, minimum and maximum and daily relative humidity levels for the eight most populous California <b>air</b> <b>basins.</b> We analyzed the dataset using a moving median analysis, a standard time series analysis, and a prediction analysis within the following analysis strategy. We examine the eight <b>air</b> <b>basins</b> separately to see if estimates replicate across locations. We use leave one year out cross validation analysis to evaluate predictions. Both the moving medians analysis and the standard time series analysis found little evidence for association between air quality and acute deaths. The prediction analysis process was a run as a large factorial design using different models and holding out one year at a time. Among the variables used to predict acute death, most of the daily death variability was explained by time of year or weather variables. In summary, the empirical evidence is that current levels of air quality, ozone and PM 2. 5, are not causally related to acute deaths for California. An empirical and logical case can be made air quality is not causally related to acute deaths {{for the rest of the}} United States. Comment: Statistics, epidemiolog...|$|R

Agricultural burning policies and penalty fees reduce the pollution from CO. Other policies such as the prohibition on visible emission, fugitive dust, particulate matter, nitrogen and the reduction of animal matter are correlated with higher levels of CO.

40|$|The {{continued}} growth of interstate freight trucking {{brings with it}} the potential for inaccuracies in official government statistics on trucks' road use and pollutant emission contributions. State government agency emission estimates for states within the US commonly rely on in-state truck and fuel use records.

An in-person interview survey of 433 heavy-duty truck drivers was conducted at select points of entry into California {{to better understand the}} contribution of out-of-state trucks, their fuel use, and their emissions in California. The results indicate that non-California-registered trucks and non-California-diesel fuel make up approximately 30 % of Class 8 heavy-duty truck mileage on California roads.

Although the method is theoretically sound, many assumptions are involved in each of its estimation steps, and uncertainty exists in each step. The control cost estimate method estimates the marginal emission control cost, which represents the opportunity cost offset by emission reductions from some given control measures. Studies conducted to estimate emission values in US regions used either the damage estimate method or the control cost estimate method. Taking emission values estimated for some US <b>air</b> <b>basins,</b> this paper establishes regression relationships between emission values and total population and air pollutant concentrations.

After considering the numerous benefits of introducing STT into the energy market, three primary benefits were identified and evaluated: (1) direct energy cost savings were estimated to range from zero to $ 50 billion; (2) oil imports may be reduced by up to 9 percent, improving national security; and (3) significant environmental benefits can be realized in <b>air</b> <b>basins</b> where electric power plant emissions create substantial air pollution problems.

40|$|The Paso del Norte Airshed {{has been}} known to have ozone problems. In one way it is {{somewhat}} unique in North America—ozone levels reach a peak much earlier in the day (around noon) than in other regions. U. S.

This led EPA staff and other scientists to postulate that very small amounts of free chlorine might be a factor that accelerates the photochemical processes that generate ozone from its precursors. That was the research question: Is chlorine, or some other halogen, present in the air during ozone events? In this study, the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), in conjunction wit...|$|R
40|$|The California Air Resources Board's {{emissions}} inventory estimates indicate that {{ambient air quality}} in several regions of California is substantially affected by the exhaust emissions of diesel trucks. There are insufficient data to accurately model the energy and emissions impacts of interstate-traveling trucks, many {{of which may be}} registered and/or fuel out-of-state. Emissions inventory estimates are based on adjustments to data on California-registered trucks. These estimates may not reflect the effect of non-California-registered trucks' attributes and operations. Further, the effects of out-of-state fueling by California-registered and non-California-registered interstate-traveling trucks are also not currently captured. In Summer 2006, an interview survey of 433 truck drivers was conducted to characterize the vehicle attributes and operations of interstate trucks that travel in California. We estimate that non-California-registered trucks account for more than one-quarter of the Class 8 heavy-duty truck mileage on California roads. Also more than one-quarter of all Class 8 heavy-duty truck mileage in California is fueled by out-of-state diesel.

UCR's second chancellor, Ivan Hinderaker led the campus through the era of the free speech movement and kept student protests peaceful in Riverside. According to a 1998 interview with Hinderaker, the city of Riverside received negative press coverage for smog after the mayor asked Governor Ronald Reagan to declare the South Coast <b>Air</b> <b>Basin</b> a disaster area in 1971; subsequent student enrollment declined by up to 25% through 1979.

50|$|The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) {{typically}} acts as {{the responsible}} agency for setting CEQA air emission thresholds within the San Francisco Bay Area <b>Air</b> <b>Basin.</b> The BAAQMD adopted new guidance on June 2, 2010 to address greenhouse gas emission thresholds related to operational related emissions from stationary sources and projects other than stationary sources. Stationary sources are allowed to emit up to 10,000 metric tons (MT) e/year. Other projects are allowed to emit 1,100 MT of e/yr; 4.6 MT e/SP/yr; or compliance with a qualified greenhouse gas reduction strategy. The BAAQMD has not established construction related emissions thresholds, deferring this responsibility to the CEQA lead agency. Chapter 8.2 of the BAAQMD Air Quality Guidelines recommends lead agencies quantify construction emissions and assess if they conflict with AB 32 goals. BAAQMD also recommends using URBEMIS air modeling software to calculate GHG emissions on land use changing projects, and RoadMod software for linear projects. BAAQMD recommends analysis of operational emissions in the five step process: eliminate greenhouse gas analysis if project attributes do not pass screening criteria, quantify emissions using appropriate models, compare unmitigated emissions with thresholds of significance, implement mitigation measures if project is over thresholds of significance, then compare emissions again with thresholds of significance.|$|E

MELA actively participated in the fight against the incinerator for several reasons: harmful health effects from probable increased air, pollution, environmental discrimination from large companies and failure for the Environmental Protection Agency and CTTS to undergo proper legal procedures. [...] After a six-year battle MELA sued the Environmental Protection Agency for failure to provide Environmental Impact Report prior to agreeing to the continuance of the project.

A DustTrak optical aerosol instrument at the height of 2. 5 m above the ground was used for surface aerosol measurements. Aerosol concentration was also measured at different heights (up to 500 m) by another DustTrak instrument attached to a tethered balloon, which also carried sondes for the measurements of wind direction, relative humidity, wind speed and air temperature. A 14 -m tower instrumented with two sonic anemometers provided further high-resolution flow measurements in support of aerosol transport studies.
