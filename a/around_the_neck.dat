5|$|One more rivalry {{from the}} Raw brand was between John Cena and JBL. In the Fatal Four-Way Elimination match at Backlash, Cena {{eliminated}} JBL by making him {{submit to the}} STFU, a move in which the wrestler wraps his arm <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> of the opponent in a sleeper hold instead of pulling back {{on the head of}} the opponent. On the April 28 episode of Raw, JBL challenged Cena to a singles match at Judgment Day, which was made official on WWE's website.|$|E
5|$|The former England home strip {{was white}} with {{a strip of}} red <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck,</b> and the away strip was black (causing much {{controversy}} due to the famous All-Black kit of New Zealand), both kits had a ground breaking new technology {{in the form of}} a gripper print. A special strip was worn during the match versus Wales in the 2010 Six Nations Championship which replicated that worn in 1910 to celebrate the 100 year anniversary of Twickenham.|$|E

5|$|Once a recruit was {{accepted}} he was 'marked' on the arm, presumably a tattoo or brand, to facilitate recognition if {{he attempted to}} desert. The recruit was then issued with an identification disk (which was worn <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck)</b> and a certificate of enlistment (probatoria). He was then assigned to a unit. A law of 375 required those with superior fitness to be assigned to the comitatenses. In the 4th century, the minimum length of service was 20 years (24 years in some limitanei units). This compares with 25 years in both legions and auxilia during the Principate.|$|E
5|$|The ninth century {{revealed}} the first bagpipes, which spread throughout Europe and had many uses from folk instruments to military instruments. The construction of pneumatic organs evolved in Europe starting in fifth-century Spain, spreading to England in about 700. The resulting instruments varied {{in size and}} use from portable organs worn <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> to large pipe organs. Literary accounts of organs being played in English Benedictine abbeys {{toward the end of}} the tenth century are the first references to organs being connected to churches. Reed players of the Middle Ages were limited to oboes; no evidence of clarinets exists during this period.|$|E
5|$|The victims' {{bodies were}} found {{floating}} in Tampa Bay on June 4, 1989. The first body was found when several people on board a sailboat, crossing under the Sunshine Skyway, saw an object in the water. The second body was seen floating off the pier in St. Petersburg, two miles north from the first. While the Coast Guard went to recover the second body, a call came in about a third, which was seen floating 200 yards to the east. All three female {{bodies were found}} face down, bound with a rope <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck,</b> and naked below the waist.|$|E

5|$|To {{prepare the}} dead for the afterlife, the mummies were {{surrounded}} with ceramic pots containing food, tunjos and cotton bags and mantles. The guecha warriors were richly venerated with golden arms, crowns, emeralds and cotton. When the caciques and zaque and zipa died, their mummified bodies {{were placed in}} mausoleums and surrounded with golden objects. The highest regarded members of society were accompanied by their many wives, by slaves and their children. The mummy of a baby described from a cave in Gámeza, Boyacá, had a teether <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck.</b> Other mummies of children were richly decorated with gold and placed in caves, {{as was the case}} with a young girl described by Liborio Zerda.|$|E
5|$|If a {{cerebral}} aneurysm is identified on angiography, two measures {{are available to}} reduce the risk of further bleeding from the same aneurysm: clipping and coiling. Clipping requires a craniotomy (opening of the skull) to locate the aneurysm, followed by the placement of clips <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> of the aneurysm. Coiling is performed through the large blood vessels (endovascularly): a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin and advanced through the aorta to the arteries (both carotid arteries and both vertebral arteries) that supply the brain. When the aneurysm has been located, platinum coils are deployed that cause a blood clot to form in the aneurysm, obliterating it. The decision as to which treatment is undertaken is typically made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist, and often other health professionals.|$|E
5|$|Officers wear badges {{of office}} {{suspended}} from a chain worn <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck.</b> The badge for the prelate shows the Lesser George encircled by the Garter, which is surmounted by a bishop's mitre. The badge for the chancellor is a rose encircled by the Garter. The badge for the register is two crossed quills over a book encircled by the Garter surmounted by a crown. The badge for Garter Principal King of Arms is the royal arms impaled with St George's Cross encircled by the Garter and surmounted by a crown. The badge for the usher is a knot (like {{those on the}} collars of the companions of the order) encircled by the Garter and surmounted by a crown. The badge for the secretary shows two crossed quills {{in front of a}} rose and encircled by the Garter surmounted by a crown.|$|E

5|$|On {{completion}} of the course, participants are awarded the Wood Badge beads to recognize significant achievement in leadership and direct service to young people. The pair of small wooden beads, one on each end of a leather thong (string), is worn <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> {{as part of the}} Scout uniform. The beads are presented together with a taupe neckerchief bearing a tartan patch of the Maclaren clan, honoring William de Bois Maclaren, who donated the £7000 to purchase Gilwell Park in 1919 plus an additional £3000 for improvements to the house that was on the estate. The neckerchief with the braided leather woggle (neckerchief slide) denotes the membership of the 1st Gilwell Scout Group or Gilwell Troop 1. Recipients of the Wood Badge are known as Wood Badgers or Gilwellians.|$|E
5|$|Quolls {{are mostly}} carnivorous. The smaller quolls {{primarily}} eat insects, birds, frogs, lizards and fruit; the larger species eat birds, reptiles, and mammals, including echidnas and possums. The tiger quoll's diet {{is dominated by}} mammals such as brushtail possums, rabbits and hares. The exact mix is variable depending {{on the availability of}} prey after bushfires, and can include carrion or bandicoots when food is scarce. The other species of quoll have also been known to eat carrion. The paws and vibrissae of quolls allow them to reach into small burrows to find prey. Quolls hunt by stalking. Depending on the size of its prey, a quoll may leap or pounce on it. Quolls pin small prey down with their front paws while devouring it, and jump onto larger prey, sinking in their claws and closing their jaws <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck.</b> Quolls can obtain all the water they need from their food, making them quite adaptable during droughts or other periods of water shortage.|$|E
5|$|Stigand did {{not travel}} to Rome {{to receive a}} pallium, the band worn <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> that is the symbol of an archbishop's authority, from the pope. Travelling to Rome for the pallium had become a custom, practised {{by a number of}} his predecessors. Instead, some medieval chroniclers state that he used Robert of Jumièges' pallium. It is not known if Stigand even petitioned the papacy for a pallium soon after his appointment. Owing to the reform movement, Stigand {{probably}} knew the request would be unsuccessful. In 1058 Antipope Benedict X, who opposed much of the reform movement, gave Stigand a pallium. However, Benedict was deposed the following year; the reforming party declared Benedict an antipope, and nullified all his acts, including Stigand's pallium grant. The exact circumstances that led to Benedict granting a pallium are unknown, whether it was at Stigand's request or was given without prompting.|$|E

5|$|The {{jewellery}} {{consists of}} three gold pendants, two glass beads, one gold wire bead, and a fragment of a jet hair pin. The pendants and beads all {{seem to have been}} strung together, probably forming a necklace that was in place <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> of the body. Two of the pieces consist of gold cabochon pendants inset with jewels, while the third is a very elaborate shield-shaped jewel inlaid with 57 red garnets and a larger scallop-shaped gem in the centre. The garnets rest on a thin layer of gold leaf to reflect the light and increase their luminosity. It may have been created from recycled older pieces of jewellery, as the size, shape and thickness of the individuals garnet are all different.|$|E
5|$|The {{meeting at}} Aintree had been beset by {{problems}} before the race. Fifteen animal rights protesters invaded the course near the first fence (as had also {{happened at the}} 1991 Grand National) resulting in a delayed start. A first false start was caused by several riders becoming tangled in the starting tape. Starter Keith Brown, who was officiating his last National before retirement, waved his red recall flag and a second official, Ken Evans, who was situated 100 yards further down the track, in turn signalled to the leading runners to turn around. At the second attempt, the tape became tangled again — <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> of jockey Richard Dunwoody — and Brown called another false start. However, this time his recall flag did not unfurl as he waved it. As a result, 30 of the 39 riders set off around the track, oblivious to the recall.|$|E
5|$|The road jersey from 1995 to 2003, {{which became}} the team's home jersey in 2003 when the NHL decided to switch home and road jerseys, is {{predominantly}} burgundy and dark blue in color. Along the jersey, there are two black and white zigzag lines, one in the shoulders, the other near the belly. Between them, the jersey is burgundy, outside those lines it is dark blue. Similar lines exist <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck.</b> The Avalanche logo is {{in the center of}} the jersey. On top of the shoulders, there is the alternate logo, one on each side. The away jersey is similar but with different colors. The burgundy part on the home jersey is white on the away jersey, the light blue part is burgundy and the black and white lines became gray and blue.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} Gaalipata turned Ganesh {{into one of}} the most sought-after actors in Kannada cinema. He was already coming on the back of major {{commercial}} successes Mungaru Male (2006), Cheluvina Chittara (2007), and moderate successes Hudugaata (2007) and Krishna (2007). Yogaraj Bhat had delivered his two consecutive films that emerged as massive commercial successes, the other being Mungaru Male. Ganesh was seen in the film wearing a chain <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> with a razor blade as the pendant. It became a trend among male fans. The film also proved to as a major break for Diganth who would go on to collaborate with Bhat frequently— Manasaare (2009), Pancharangi (2010) and Parapancha (2015). The nickname 'Doodh Peda' (an Indian sweet), by which Ganesh addresses to him as, in the film, came to be attached with his name in the media along with a tag of 'Chocolate Hero'. The film also proved to be a launchpad in the careers of actresses Neethu and Bhavana Rao.|$|E
5|$|It is not {{possible}} to confirm whether some injuries took place before or after death, due to the body's state of decay. This is the case for the wound in the upper right chest and the laceration {{on the back of the}} skull. The cut on the right of the neck may have been the result of the body becoming bloated, causing the skin to split; however, the straight edges to the wound suggest that it may have been caused by a sharp instrument, such as a knife. The ligature marks on the neck may have occurred after death. In some interpretations of Lindow Man's death, the sinew is a garrotte used to break the man's neck. However, Robert Connolly, a lecturer in physical anthropology, suggests that the sinew may have been ornamental and that ligature marks may have been caused by the body swelling when submerged. The rib fracture may also have occurred after death, perhaps during the discovery of the body, but is included in some narratives of Lindow Man's death. The broken neck would have proven the fatal injury, whether caused by the sinew cord tightening <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> or by blows to the back of the head. After death, Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss face down.|$|E
5|$|To {{create the}} {{original}} label for THB, Star Breweries opted to copy an existing label for a Dutch beer brand called The Holland Beer, which featured {{the image of}} three horses. This was done {{in part because of}} the association between Antsirabe and its history of horse breeding; the brand took the name Three Horses Beer based on this design. The label also features the brand's slogan, Soa Ny Fiarahantsika ("The Pleasure of Being Together"). The labels were originally printed in the Netherlands and shipped to Madagascar before eventually being produced on the local market; THB coasters continue to be produced in Europe. The bottle color and shape and its label have undergone adjustments over time. In 2005, the label was enlarged and the colors brightened. The band <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> of the bottle was also broadened with the addition of the image of a medal, in honor of the beer's first international award in 2004. A new logo was adopted for the canned THB before being expanded in 2014 to the 33 cl bottled THB. The new logo features three stylized, outlined white horses, now facing right to represent a focus on the future. Red remains the predominant color.|$|E
