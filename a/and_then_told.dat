5|$|This was {{the first}} episode to have Mila Kunis {{providing}} the voice of Meg. Lacey Chabert, the original voice of Meg, left the series due to time constraints with her acting role in Party of Five, as well as schoolwork. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, {{in part due to}} her performance on That '70s Show. Seth MacFarlane, the show's creator, called Kunis back after her first audition, instructing her to speak slower, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her.|$|E
5|$|From the 1950s onwards, {{stories about}} Brown were often {{included}} in local {{histories of the}} southeast of South Australia. Examples include Elma Smith's History of Kingston published in 1950, and Kingston Flashback written by local historian Verne McLaren and published in 1970. In Smith's version, the original crime was not discussed, and {{the focus was on}} the horse ride to Adelaide, and McLaren's account split the legend into two, one about a poisoning by Brown, and another in which Brown and an accomplice cornered Aboriginal people in the Papineau caves, smoked them out and shot them. The second of McLaren's stories ended with Brown's famous ride to Adelaide to report to the police. Another account was included in Barry Durman's A History of the Baker's Range Settlement, published in 1978. Durman reproduced a newspaper article about the investigation into Brown's involvement in the murders, passed over the manner by which the murders were carried out and stated that the case was not proven, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> of a wonderful feat of horsemanship by Brown.|$|E
25|$|An {{instance}} of a Japanese atrocity was {{committed in the}} area of the rubber trees around Trolak. In this area were a number of Argyll and Hyderabad wounded. 2nd Lieutenant Ian Primrose reports that after he regained consciousness from an injury during the fighting he discovered that the Japanese were dividing the wounded into those who said they could walk and those who said they could not. Primrose decided he could walk, which was fortunate as the Japanese soldiers proceeded to shoot and bayonet the wounded who could not. Afterward the survivors were forced to dig graves for the dead <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> to carry the Japanese wounded.|$|E

25|$|Piaget {{argued that}} {{children}} and adults used speech for different purposes. In order to confirm his argument, he experimented analyzing a child’s interpretation of a story. In the experiment, the child listened to a story <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> a friend that same story in his/her/their own words. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine how children verbalize and understand each other without adult intervention. Piaget wanted to examine the limits of naturalistic observation, in order to understand a child’s reasoning. He realized the difficulty of studying children's thoughts, as it is hard to know if a child is pretending to believe their thoughts or not. Piaget was the pioneer researcher to examine children’s conversations in a social context – starting from examining their speech and actions – where children were comfortable and spontaneous (Kose, 1987).|$|E
25|$|However, the {{relationship}} of Alexander I and Aspasia has not only enemies. The Greek royal dynasty was indeed of German-Danish origin and to find Byzantine ancestors to them they have to {{going back to the}} Middle Ages. In these circumstances, the union of the monarch and his fiancee would effectively Hellenize the dynasty, which would not displease all the Greeks. Finally, in the same foreign powers, particularly the British Embassy, the assumption of this marriage was seen favorably. Indeed, the influence of Aspasia is found to be positive on the sovereign, because she gave to him the strength to remain in the throne. The official visit of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, to Athens in March 1918 also confirmed the support of the United Kingdom to the marriage project. The son of Queen Victoria in fact requested to meet Aspasia <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> Alexander I that if he had been younger, he too would have sought to marry her.|$|E
25|$|Then {{came the}} rematch with Bowe on November 6, 1993. In what is {{considered}} by many sporting historians {{as one of the most}} bizarre moments in boxing's history, during round seven the crowd got off their feet and many people started to run for cover and yell. Holyfield took his eyes off Bowe for one moment <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> Bowe to look up to the skies. What they saw was a man in a parachute flying dangerously close to them. The man almost entered the ring, but his parachute had gotten entangled in the lights and he landed on the ropes and apron of the ring, and he was then pulled into the crowd, where he was beaten by members of Bowe's entourage. Bowe's pregnant wife, Judy, fainted and had to be taken to the hospital from the arena. Twenty minutes later, calm was restored and Holyfield went on to recover his world heavyweight titles with a close 12 round majority decision. The man who parachuted down to the middle of the ring became known as The Fan Man and the fight itself became known as the Fan Man Fight. His victory over Bowe that year helped Holyfield being named as ABC's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year for 1993.|$|E

500|$|According to U.S. defense officials, {{upon his}} return to the base Bales said three words: [...] "I did it" [...] <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> {{individuals}} what happened. Later he retained a lawyer and refused to speak further with investigators. The U.S. flew Bales out of Afghanistan to Kuwait on 14 March 2012, then to the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas on 16 March. [...] A Pentagon spokesman said the move was done because of a [...] "legal recommendation".|$|E
500|$|For the Astral Weeks sessions, {{apparently}} {{they did not}} employ any lead sheets, or at least none were distributed to the musicians. [...] "What stood out in my mind {{was the fact that}} he allowed us to stretch out," [...] recalls Berliner. [...] "We were used to playing to charts, but Van just played us the songs on his guitar <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> us to go ahead and play exactly what we felt." [...] Berliner actually had great appreciation for the freedom given to him and the band; something few, if any, of them were used to. [...] "I played a lot of classical guitar on those sessions and it was very unusual to play classical guitar in that context," [...] says Berliner.|$|E
500|$|Mila Kunis is {{the voice}} of the {{character}} named Meg Griffin. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on That '70s Show. MacFarlane called Kunis back after her first audition, instructing her to speak slower, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her. Kunis described her character as [...] "the scapegoat". She further explained, [...] "Meg gets picked on a lot. But it's funny. It's like the middle child. She is constantly in the state of being an awkward 14-year-old, when you're kind of going through puberty and what-not. She's just in a perpetual mode of humiliation. And it's fun." ...|$|E

500|$|Matt Hills and Rebecca Williams also {{discuss the}} {{treatment}} of Cordelia (and Darla) in [...] "Angels Monstrous Mothers and Vampires with Soul: Investigating the Abject in 'Television Horror'", from [...] by Stacey Abbot. They see the send-offs of Cordelia, Fred and other characters {{as part of a}} pattern of highly gendered [...] "elaborated abjection" [...] seen in Angel. They also see Cordelia's possession in season four as part of a recurring pattern: [...] "More so than other characters in [...] and Angel, Cordelia has suffered or been threatened with bodily invasion and rape, either symbolically or literally" [...] and recounts the demon impregnation in [...] "Expecting", and similarly in [...] "Epiphany", where she develops a gestating demon in her head <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> she must mate with the Groosalugg in [...] "Through the Looking Glass". Cordelia even remarks on this, as Hills and Williams quote her as she remarks on her [...] "status as a violated and devalued character"; Cordelia states, [...] "If you ever {{figure out how to get}} us out of here, I want you to find me a dimension where some demon doesn't want to impregnate me with his spawn!" [...] They liken the horror motif in these examples, and in [...] "Inside Out", to what Barbara Creed called the 'monstrous womb' in her book The Monstrous-feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis. Jes Battis also comments how, in comparison with the Fred-Illyria season five storyline, Cordelia's storyline is not as positive as Fred's rebirth, because Fred got to [...] "'live on' through Illyria, whereas Cordelia is taken right out of the show and receives no interesting blue-haired reincarnation". Continuing, they say that in fact, there is no meaningful connection between the [...] "real" [...] Cordelia and Jasmine, as the Cordelia who did those bad things is killed the moment Jasmine is, [...] "and the 'true' Cordy wakes up from her coma". Further illustrating the comparisons, [...] "Fred/Illyria become a joined mother/daughter subjectivity, a dual being whose constituent essences are inseparable; Cordelia is never so intimately connected with her evil child and is remembered as the healthy, vibrant Cordy that everyone knew." [...] Pointing out symbolic parallels in the subtexts of these gestations, Battis notes Cordelia, a vocal advocate of her own privilege, creates a fully formed supernatural being, Jasmine, who attempts (shockingly) to control the world. Fred, on the other hand, who internalizes her own privilege and cannot express it except in terms of insecurity and awkwardness, has her body devoured from the inside by the demon Illyria.|$|E
2500|$|At {{a meeting}} of the Monday Club in 1968, Donnelly {{received}} a two-minute standing ovation, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> members [...] "Mr Wilson should resign and leave public life". However he was not willing to join the Conservative Party and instead set up his own party, initially known as 'Our Party' but later the Democratic Party. In some respects the party's policy was {{to the right of the}} Conservatives, advocating the abolition of the welfare state, sweeping changes to the taxation system, and the return of national service. The party fought five seats at the 1970 general election but polled poorly. Donnelly himself lost Pembrokeshire to the Conservatives.|$|E
2500|$|After {{kissing the}} text of the Book of the Gospels, Ratzinger stood before the congregants to offer the homily which {{included}} references to the life and service of Pope John Paul. He spoke in Italian, first greeting the many political figures and religious leaders that had gathered, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> the story of how the young Karol had answered the Lord's call, and became a priest after the persecution of the Nazis, the answer of the command: [...] "Follow me!" [...] Ratzinger also told of John Paul's life as a bishop, cardinal, and pope, frequently applying scripture to the pope's life. Finally, he told of the pope's devotion to Mary and the Divine Mercy of Christ. The cardinal's last words were about the end of Pope John Paul II's life: ...|$|E

2500|$|Torture is {{normally}} illegal, but in extreme circumstances and with {{orders from the}} Chief Judge they employ it (both physical and psychological), for example when {{time is of the}} essence, due to the city being in severe danger (or the Justice Departments authority is). They used that reason to torture Total War cell leaders leading to the deaths of several of them. The Judges covered this up, [...] "arresting" [...] them by faking heart attacks, strokes or whatever was realistic or convenient at that time <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> their next of kin they had died, with this they could do whatever they wanted to them. They also used torture on the leading democrats before the democratic march, such as keeping an elderly democrat awake all night and then releasing him without charge, knowing he would have to march all day the following day and making severe threats to another involving his young children.|$|E
2500|$|Disguised as Esau, Jacob entered Isaac's room. Surprised that Esau {{was back}} so soon, Isaac asked {{how it could}} be that the hunt went so quickly. Jacob responded, [...] "Because the LORD your God brought it to me." [...] Rashi, on [...] says Isaac's suspicions were aroused even more, because Esau never used the {{personal}} name of God. Isaac demanded that Jacob come close so he could feel him, but the goatskins felt just like Esau's hairy skin. Confused, Isaac exclaimed, [...] "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau!" [...] Still trying to get at the truth, Isaac asked him directly, [...] "Art thou my very son Esau?" [...] and Jacob answered simply, [...] "I am." [...] Isaac proceeded to eat the food and to drink the wine that Jacob gave him, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> him to come close and kiss him. [...] As Jacob kissed his father, Isaac smelled the clothes which belonged to Esau and finally accepted that the person in front of him was Esau. Isaac then blessed Jacob with the blessing that was meant for Esau. Genesis 27:28–29 states Isaac's blessing: [...] "Therefore God give thee of the dew of heavens, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: [...] Let people serve thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wray {{was also}} a member {{of one of the most}} famous B-movie units at work during what is now viewed as the 'Golden Age' of Hollywood -- a group whose {{creative}} energy and inventiveness made Lewton's success possible. She spoke about working with the group in a conversation with her daughter many years later, a recollection that shines a clear light on the group's chemistry and skill, and the special place it held in Wray's heart:She rarely spoke about her early career or the McCarthy era. [...] But when I asked once what it was like working with Lewton, she smiled -- thought about it for a long moment -- <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> me about the night the group spent figuring out how to build to the first murder in The Leopard Man. [...] The scene she had written was pure psychological terror, trading on very basic fears -- of the dark, of being punished unjustly, locked out of your own home, abandoned by people you trust -- and at the same time it sets up the mystery that is the premise of the entire film. [...] They were under pressure to get this sequence right, and almost everyone was there that night. The session went well into the small hours of the morning, was filled with laughter, and included a hilarious riff as one of them experimented with a set of castanets, which turned out to be the key to building the tension and suspense. They worked their way through a dozen different shot sequences before they were satisfied and, listening to her, I had the very strong impression that they would have come up with that same elegant, powerful scene even if they had been working with an A-movie budget and had more time. [...] As Agee so famously observed about Lewton, these were people who understood film and cared about human beings. [...] I can still see the smile on her face as she recalled that night. [...] -- Stefani Warren, September 2016 ...|$|E
