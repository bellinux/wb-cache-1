5|$|In 1662, {{the book}} La Logique ou l’Art de Penser was {{published}} anonymously in Paris. The authors presumably were Antoine Arnauld and Pierre Nicole, two leading Jansenists, who worked together with Blaise Pascal. The Latin {{title of this}} book is Ars cogitandi, which was a successful book on logic of the time. The Ars cogitandi consists of four books, with the fourth one dealing with decision-making under uncertainty by considering the <b>analogy</b> <b>to</b> gambling and introducing explicitly {{the concept of a}} quantified probability.|$|E
5|$|The pseudoarboricity of a graph G {{is defined}} by <b>analogy</b> <b>to</b> the arboricity as the minimum number of pseudoforests into which its edges can be partitioned; equivalently, it is the minimum k such that G is (k,0)-sparse, or the minimum k such that the edges of G can be {{oriented}} to form a directed graph with outdegree at most k. Due to the matroid structure of pseudoforests, the pseudoarboricity may be computed in polynomial time.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of the ancient city of Jeitun, which dates to 6000 BC, kept sheep and goats as their primary livestock. There have also been numerous identifications of Nomadic pastoralism in archaeological sites, identified by a prevalence of sheep and goat bones, a lack of grain or grain-processing equipment, very limited architecture showing a set of characteristic traits, a location outside the region's zone of agriculture, and ethnographic <b>analogy</b> <b>to</b> modern nomadic pastoral peoples.|$|E

5|$|The {{storm petrel}} cannot survive on islands where land mammals such as rats and cats have been introduced, and it suffers natural {{predation}} from gulls, skuas, owls and falcons. Although the population may be declining slightly, this petrel is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern {{due to its}} high total numbers. Its presence in rough weather at sea has led to various mariners' superstitions, and, by <b>analogy,</b> <b>to</b> its use as a symbol by revolutionary and anarchist groups.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{biological}} possibilities, {{there are}} formidable obstacles {{to life on}} Titan, and any <b>analogy</b> <b>to</b> Earth is inexact. At a vast distance from the Sun, Titan is frigid, and its atmosphere lacks CO2. At Titan's surface, water exists only in solid form. Because of these difficulties, scientists such as Jonathan Lunine have viewed Titan less as a likely habitat for life, than as an experiment for examining theories on the conditions that prevailed prior to the appearance of life on Earth. Although life itself may not exist, the prebiotic conditions on Titan and the associated organic chemistry remain of great interest in understanding {{the early history of}} the terrestrial biosphere. Using Titan as a prebiotic experiment involves not only observation through spacecraft, but laboratory experiments, and chemical and photochemical modeling on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Himmler {{discussed}} {{plans with}} his subordinates to integrate {{at least the}} German-speaking parts of Switzerland completely {{with the rest of}} Germany, and had several persons in mind for the post of a Reichskommissar for the 're-union' of Switzerland with the German Reich (in <b>analogy</b> <b>to</b> the office that Josef Bürckel held after Austria's absorption into Germany during the Anschluss). Later this official was to subsequently become the new Reichsstatthalter of the area after completing its total assimilation. In August 1940, Gauleiter of Westfalen-South Josef Wagner and the Minister President of Baden Walter Köhler spoke in favor of the amalgamation of Switzerland to Reichsgau Burgund (see below) and suggested that the seat of government for this new administrative territory should be the dormant Palais des Nations in Geneva.|$|E

40|$|Some recent {{findings}} with expert designers relate problem-solution co-evolution and <b>analogy</b> use <b>to</b> framing practices. We wanted to understand if novices also use coevolution and <b>analogies</b> <b>to</b> frame their thinking. Furthermore {{we wanted to}} see if there are any differences across cultures. The paper reports an analysis of data gained from protocol studies with novice interaction designers in the UK and Botswana. Novice interaction designers in the UK and Botswana show some similarities in framing behaviours using co-evolution and opening <b>analogies</b> <b>to</b> develop metaphorical themes in framing. But within these observations we also found differences across the cohorts. The implications are discussed in the light of adopting appropriate design pedagogy for novices in different cultures. ...|$|R

5|$|On June 22 the FIA {{produced}} {{a press release}} from Max Mosley, {{in the form of}} a question-and-answer session, in an effort to clarify the FIA's stand on the controversy. In it Mosley drew an <b>analogy</b> <b>to</b> a hypothetical situation where the engines from one manufacturer had oil starvation problems due to high lateral loading in one corner, and pointed out that those cars would simply have been forced to run slower as a result. He reiterated that the reason for not installing the chicane was purely that it had never been tested and was thereby deemed unsafe. He pointed out that the alternatives that the FIA suggested were feasible, and wondered why the teams did not use the pitlane as an alternative, especially when, with only six Bridgestone cars, the Michelin teams could still compete for the points scoring seventh and eighth places.|$|E
5|$|The total {{complement}} of proteins present {{at a time}} in a cell or cell type is known as its proteome, and the study of such large-scale data sets defines the field of proteomics, named by <b>analogy</b> <b>to</b> the related field of genomics. Key experimental techniques in proteomics include 2D electrophoresis, which allows the separation {{of a large number of}} proteins, mass spectrometry, which allows rapid high-throughput identification of proteins and sequencing of peptides (most often after in-gel digestion), protein microarrays, which allow the detection of the relative levels of a large number of proteins present in a cell, and two-hybrid screening, which allows the systematic exploration of protein–protein interactions. The {{total complement}} of biologically possible such interactions is known as the interactome. A systematic attempt to determine the structures of proteins representing every possible fold is known as structural genomics.|$|E
5|$|Philip J. Currie of the University of Alberta has {{suggested}} that Tyrannosaurus may have been pack animals. Currie compared Tyrannosaurus rex favorably to related species Tarbosaurus bataar and Albertosaurus sarcophagus, fossil evidence from which Currie had previously used {{to suggest that they}} lived in packs. Currie pointed out that a find in South Dakota preserved three Tyrannosaurus rex skeletons in close proximity to each other. After using CT scanning, Currie stated that Tyrannosaurus would have been capable of such complex behavior, because its brain size is three times greater than what would be expected for an animal of its size. Currie elaborated that Tyrannosaurus had a larger brain-to-body-size proportion than crocodiles and three times more than plant eating dinosaurs such as Triceratops of the same size. Currie believed Tyrannosaurus to be six times smarter than most dinosaurs and other reptiles. Because the available prey, such as Triceratops and Ankylosaurus, were well-armored, and that others were fast-moving, it would have been necessary for Tyrannosaurus to hunt in groups. Currie speculated that juveniles and adults would have hunted together, with the faster juveniles chasing down the prey and the more powerful adults making the kill, by <b>analogy</b> <b>to</b> modern-day pack hunters where each member contributes a skill.|$|E
40|$|This project {{proposal}} addresses {{the issue of}} retrieving and using <b>analogies</b> <b>to</b> guide a creative design process. There is evidence that human designers use <b>analogies</b> <b>to</b> produce novel creative designs. These analogies are unique in that they often associate concepts that are not normally thought of as connected. That is, the concepts do not share many superficial or even structural features, while they still share underlying functional properties. The purpose of our project is {{to develop and implement}} a computational model of creative design which retrieves and uses these types of "distant" analogies. We have developed an architecture in which the search through a knowledge base for an analogy is guided by knowledge about design, knowledge about analogies, and feedback from "near-misses" encountered previously in the search. This architecture is being implemented in a design program which uses retrieved <b>analogies</b> <b>to</b> refine design specifications...|$|R

5|$|Unbiunium is {{predicted}} {{to be the first}} element of an unprecedentedly long transition series, called the superactinides in <b>analogy</b> <b>to</b> the earlier actinides. While its behaviour {{is not likely to be}} very distinct from its lighter congeners in group 3, it is likely to pose a limit to the applicability of the periodic law; after element 121, the 5g, 6f, 7d, and 8p1/2 orbitals are expected to fill up together due to their very close energies, and around the elements in the late 150s and 160s the 9s, 9p1/2, and 8p3/2 subshells join in, so that the chemistry of the elements just beyond 121 and 122 (the last for which complete calculations have been conducted) is expected to be so similar that their position in the periodic table would be purely a formal matter. Like its lighter congeners, unbiunium could be considered to begin the 7d series of elements, which would be the fifth row of transition metals.|$|E
