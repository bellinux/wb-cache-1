25|$|One of {{the most}} acutely toxic indoor air {{contaminants}} is carbon monoxide (CO), a colourless, odourless gas that is a byproduct of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. Common sources of carbon monoxide are tobacco smoke, space heaters using fossil fuels, defective central heating furnaces and <b>automobile</b> <b>exhaust.</b> By depriving the brain of oxygen, high levels of carbon monoxide can lead to nausea, unconsciousness and death.

25|$|Frozen fog (also {{known as}} ice fog) is {{any kind of}} fog where the {{droplets}} have frozen into extremely tiny crystals of ice in midair. Generally this requires temperatures at or below , making it common only in and near the Arctic and Antarctic regions. It is most often seen in urban areas where it is created by the freezing of water vapor present in <b>automobile</b> <b>exhaust</b> and combustion products from heating and power generation. Urban ice fog can become extremely dense and will persist day and night until the temperature rises. Extremely small amounts of ice fog falling from the sky form a type of precipitation called ice crystals, often reported in Barrow, Alaska. Ice fog often leads to the visual phenomenon of light pillars.|$|E
25|$|Sociologists and criminologists {{have not}} reached {{consensus}} on the explanation for the dramatic decrease in the city's crime rate. Some attribute the phenomenon to new tactics used by the NYPD, including its use of CompStat and the broken windows theory. Others cite {{the end of the}} crack epidemic and demographic changes, including from immigration. Another theory is that widespread exposure to lead pollution from <b>automobile</b> <b>exhaust,</b> which can lower intelligence and increase aggression levels, incited the initial crime wave in the mid-20th century, most acutely affecting heavily trafficked cities like New York. A strong correlation was found demonstrating that violent crime rates in New York and other big cities began to fall after lead was removed from American gasoline in the 1970s. Another theory cited to explain New York City's falling homicide rate is the inverse correlation between the number of murders and the increasingly wetter climate in the city.|$|E
25|$|Deep-set {{windows in}} {{rectilinear}} shapes, a Breuer trademark, were {{planned for the}} facade. The window frames were made of precast concrete. The building was the first Breuer-designed structure in the United States to use a precast concrete facade, {{and this was the}} first federal building to be built of precast concrete. The facade was designed to be load-bearing, with the panels on the second, third, and fourth floors designed to carry the weight of the building. The window frames on the eighth, ninth, and tenth floors were slightly thinner, because although they were not load-bearing they had to contain HVAC piping. The panels on the middle floors required the least amount of fabrication, according to architect Herbert Beckhard (an associate in Breuer's firm who helped design the building), as they did not need to bear as much load nor contain much piping. The windows do not meet {{at the corner of the}} concrete frame. Pipes from the I-395 tunnel (which runs below the building) run up through the building's walls and vent at the corners of the window frames, dispersing <b>automobile</b> <b>exhaust</b> fumes high in the air. Each concrete unit is three feet (0.9 metres) thick and weighs almost 13 tons (11.8 metric tonnes). The firm which supplied the window frames had no previous experience producing architectural concrete, but instead had supplied precast forms for bridges and parking garages.|$|E

50|$|Ozone is {{produced}} by short wavelength (110 nm - 220 nm) UV photolysis of oxygen in the upper atmosphere. The photochemical reaction of nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons from <b>automobile</b> <b>exhausts</b> is another source. Ozone plays a dual role in weathering. The concentrated layer in the upper atmosphere absorbs the short wavelength (≤300 nm) ultraviolet radiation emitted by the sun and thus plays {{a critical role in}} protecting terrestrial objects from this actinic radiation. Ozone is also a powerful oxidant and reported to react rapidly with elastomers and other unsaturated polymers. Ozonolysis typically results in stiffening and cracking, particularly under mechanical stress. However, the contribution of ozonolysis reactions to the overall photooxidation process is still subject to controversy.|$|R
