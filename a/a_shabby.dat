5|$|Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) revives {{the student}} {{newspaper}} The Muckraker. She wants to publish libel about the McKinley High glee club to cause {{conflict between the}} club's members and destroy it from within. Brittany's (Heather Morris) new internet talk show—"Fondue for Two"—gives the newspaper some grist when she seems to out Santana (Naya Rivera) on it. Santana berates Brittany for her ill-chosen words, and Finn (Cory Monteith) nearly comes to blows with Sam (Chord Overstreet) over another item that pairs Sam and Finn's girlfriend Quinn (Dianna Agron). Although Quinn and Sam both deny dating, Finn plans a stakeout with Rachel's help {{to see if it}} is true. Their surveillance of <b>a</b> <b>shabby</b> motel instead finds Sam and Kurt (Chris Colfer) leaving a room, after which Sam goes back inside alone.|$|E
5|$|Milton Hay desired {{that his}} nephew go to Washington as a {{qualified}} attorney, and John Hay {{was admitted to}} the bar in Illinois on February 4, 1861. On February 11, he embarked with President-elect Lincoln on a circuitous journey to Washington. By this time, several Southern states had seceded to form the Confederate States of America in reaction to the election of Lincoln, seen as an opponent of slavery. When Lincoln was sworn in on March 4, Hay and Nicolay moved into the White House, sharing <b>a</b> <b>shabby</b> bedroom. As there was only authority for payment of one presidential secretary (Nicolay), Hay was appointed to a post in the Interior Department at $1,600 per year, seconded to service at the White House. They were available to Lincoln 24 hours a day. As Lincoln took no vacations as president and worked seven days a week, often until 11 pm (or later, during crucial battles) the burden on his secretaries was heavy.|$|E
25|$|When Colonel McKee died, he {{left his}} {{daughter}} Abbie <b>a</b> <b>shabby</b> house and a legacy of just $300, and $50 for each of her children. Henry McKee Minton was also given $50, {{with most of the}} rest going to the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
60|$|Tommy {{handed over}} <b>a</b> rather <b>shabby</b> green notebook, and Tuppence began writing busily.|$|R

60|$|But, {{as soon as}} Dick was gone, {{he turned}} to <b>a</b> little <b>shabby</b> archer at his elbow.|$|R
25|$|Between May 1839 and February 1840 Fraser's {{published}} the work sometimes considered Thackeray's first novel, Catherine. Originally {{intended as a}} satire of the Newgate school of crime fiction, it ended up being more of a picaresque tale. He also began work, never finished, on the novel later published as <b>A</b> <b>Shabby</b> Genteel Story.|$|E
25|$|Rose and Owen {{find out}} that their {{apartment}} block {{is to become a}} co-op. Rose visits her son, who lives in <b>a</b> <b>shabby</b> neighborhood; he says he likes to go to the East Village. One Sunday she takes a walk, goes to an automat and bumps into her husband. Owen then goes to a gay pornographic cinema, where a man leaves him his number.|$|E
25|$|While Joe remains {{hidden in}} <b>a</b> <b>shabby</b> rented room, Carmen {{secretly}} visits Husky's gym to ask Frankie for a loan, but she insists {{she has no}} money of her own. Carmen returns to the boarding house {{with a bag of}} groceries, and Joe questions how she paid for them. The two argue, and she goes to Husky's hotel suite to play cards with her friends. When she draws the nine of spades, she interprets it as a premonition of impending doom and descends into a quagmire of drink and debauchery.|$|E
60|$|Behind the footlights hangs {{the rusty}} baize, <b>A</b> trifle <b>shabby</b> in the upturned blaze Of flaring gas, and curious eyes that gaze.|$|R
5000|$|..... With his stubble, {{baseball}} cap and habitual bleary-eyed look, hes like <b>a</b> <b>shabbier</b> version of The Daily Shows Jon Stewart. His approach isnt always subtle, sometimes abusing {{the powers that}} be in terms that would make Frankie Boyle blanch - as when he suggested the Brazilian president, a former victim of brutal state torture, had brought it upon herself - but its won him a considerable domestic following among those who find his uncompromising style a breath of fresh air." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} seems to you," [...] said the Doctor, laughing, [...] "that in so doing I should play your brother <b>a</b> very <b>shabby</b> trick." ...|$|R
25|$|Asbury Park {{was used}} for the {{location}} filming of the crime drama City by the Sea (2002), starring Robert De Niro, James Franco and Frances McDormand, which was nominally set in Long Beach, New York, where no filming actually took place, according to a disclaimer that was included as part of the closing credits. The film features scenes set on <b>a</b> <b>shabby,</b> dilapidated boardwalk and in a ruined/abandoned casino/arcade building. Residents of both places objected to the way their cities were depicted. Asbury Park appears {{at the start of the}} 1999 film Dogma.|$|E
25|$|Lyon was slight {{of figure}} with <b>a</b> <b>shabby</b> appearance; his boots were often unpolished, his uniform was often faded, and his {{insignia}} were often tarnished. Nonetheless, the men {{under his command}} {{were said to have}} respected him. Lyon was known for his love of mustard, and was often seen by his troops to be slathering it on thick slices of bread, {{even in the midst of}} battle. He never married but had 1 unnamed son; it is often written that he bequeathed all his property to the federal government of the United States, but this is disputed.|$|E
500|$|The 2007 Royal Opera House {{production}} by Richard Jones updated the action to <b>a</b> <b>shabby</b> 1940s Italy of [...] "unemptied chamber pots, garish floral wallpaper and damp ceilings", with Bryn Terfel {{in the title}} role [...] "a masterpiece of monstrous vulgarity". In the 2009 revival of this production, Schicchi was sung by Thomas Allen, while Gwynne Howell, as Simone, celebrated 40 years with the Royal Opera.|$|E
500|$|Using his {{experience}} from visiting New York {{in the same}} time period in which the film's story took place, Scott sought to downplay a [...] "Beatles" [...] atmosphere to the film and to instead create <b>a</b> <b>shabbier</b> atmosphere, saying that [...] "Harlem was really, really shabby, beautiful brownstones falling apart." [...] Production and costume design was emphasized, transforming the location into the rundown streets of upper Manhattan from the late 1960s and early 1970s. Denzel Washington, as Frank Lucas, went through 64 different costume changes.|$|R
60|$|Each time I saw Ellesworth {{he looked}} <b>a</b> little <b>shabbier</b> than the last. Then {{one day he}} called me up on the telephone, and made an appointment.|$|R
5000|$|Owide owned Bentley's {{restaurant}} at 11-15 Swallow Street, [...] "once one of London's favourites but in Owide's ownership, <b>a</b> rather <b>shabby</b> place". It {{was purchased by}} the chef Richard Corrigan in 2005.|$|R
500|$|The 1975–76 Rothmans Football Yearbook stated frankly {{that the}} 1974–75 season opened on 10 August [...] "with <b>a</b> <b>shabby</b> Charity Shield game at Wembley". It criticised [...] "continuous brawling" [...] among the players which climaxed {{in the joint}} {{dismissal}} of Kevin Keegan and Leeds captain Billy Bremner for [...] "swapping punches". Bill Shankly, however, contradicted that in his autobiography, saying that [...] "it was developing into an interesting game, but it was spoiled completely when Keegan and Bremner were sent off". He added that Leeds and Liverpool had been rivals for years [...] "and {{there had been no}} trouble".|$|E
500|$|Jared Lee Loughner, the suspect, was {{described}} as a white male in his mid-20s with short hair and [...] "dressed in <b>a</b> <b>shabby</b> manner". He was arrested after being detained by bystanders, and police later released his name and details. The FBI attempted to question Loughner, but he reportedly refused to cooperate with authorities and invoked his Fifth Amendment rights. Authorities said that Loughner's motive was unknown. They said that evidence seized from a safe in Loughner's home included an envelope marked with notes reading [...] "I planned ahead", [...] "My assassination", and [...] "Giffords", as well as a letter from Giffords's office thanking him for attending a similar event in 2007.|$|E
500|$|In {{the decades}} since its release, The Hustler has {{cemented}} {{its reputation as}} a classic. Roger Ebert, echoing earlier praise for the performances, direction, and cinematography and adding laurels for editor Dede Allen, cites the film as [...] "one of those films where scenes have such psychic weight that they grow in our memories." [...] He further cites Fast Eddie Felson as one of [...] "only a handful of movie characters so real that the audience refers to them as touchstones." [...] TV Guide calls the film a [...] "dark stunner" [...] offering [...] "a grim world whose only bright spot is {{the top of the}} pool table, yet [...] characters [...] maintain <b>a</b> <b>shabby</b> nobility and grace." [...] The four leads are again lavishly praised for their performances and the film is summed up as [...] "not to be missed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fifteen years ago, on a Sunday morning like this, I {{stood at}} the window of <b>a</b> fireless, <b>shabby</b> little room, without one cent in my pocket, and no {{prospect}} of getting one.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Mr Hazlit, {{sitting down}} on a broken chair in <b>a</b> very <b>shabby</b> little room, and wiping his heated brow, [...] "what {{is the meaning of}} all this, Mr Timms?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, tha 'rt a nice'st un, I must say! What's want goin' in this pig-in-a-poke fashion for? This is <b>a</b> nice <b>shabby</b> {{trick to}} serve a body! What does ta mean by it?" ...|$|R
500|$|Nixon saw his {{policies}} regarding Vietnam, China, and the Soviets as {{key to his}} place in history. George McGovern, Nixon's onetime opponent, commented in 1983, [...] "President Nixon probably had a more practical approach to the two superpowers, China and the Soviet Union, than any other president since World War II... With the exception of his inexcusable continuation {{of the war in}} Vietnam, Nixon really will get high marks in history." [...] Political scientist Jussi Hanhimäki disagrees, saying Nixon's diplomacy was merely a continuation of the Cold War policy of containment, using diplomatic rather than military means. Historian Christopher Andrew concludes that [...] "Nixon was a great statesman on the world stage as well as <b>a</b> <b>shabby</b> practitioner of electoral politics in the domestic arena. While the criminal farce of Watergate was in the making, Nixon's inspirational statesmanship was establishing new working relationships with both Communist China and the Soviet Union." ...|$|E
500|$|Moreover, {{the student}} must have good instructors, who emphasise reason over rhetoric. Russell {{indicates}} that the critical mind is an essential feature of the healthy citizen of a democracy, since collective hysteria {{is one of the}} greatest threats to democracy (Russell 1938:248). To foster a critical mind, he suggests, the teacher ought to show the students the consequences of pursuing one's feelings over one's thoughts. For example, the teacher might allow students to choose a field trip between two different locations: one fantastic place which is given a dull overview, and <b>a</b> <b>shabby</b> place which is recommended by impressive advertisements. In teaching history, the teacher might examine a particular event from a multitude of different perspectives, and allow the students to use their critical faculties to make assessments of each. (Russell 1938:247) In all cases, the object would be to encourage self-growth, a willingness to be [...] "tentative in judgment", and [...] "responsiveness to evidence". (Russell 1938:250) ...|$|E

6000|$|He laughed uneasily. [...] "I don't {{know how}} I came {{to think of}} it--unless it is that she wears the same dress every day. Very neat; but (perhaps I'm wrong) <b>a</b> little <b>shabby</b> too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh dear! where CAN I find {{something}} to make me look less like a nun,--and <b>a</b> very <b>shabby</b> one, too?" [...] she said, longing for the pink corals she sold to pay Laura's doctor's bill.|$|R
60|$|The {{man stood}} on the {{threshold}} of the room opening out from the bedroom--tall, florid, untidily dressed, with clean-shaven, humorous face, ungloved hands, and <b>a</b> terribly <b>shabby</b> hat. He looked around the room and shrugged his shoulders.|$|R
2500|$|Coretta Scott King, {{the widow}} of Martin Luther King Jr. wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee to oppose the nomination. In her letter, she wrote that [...] "Mr. Sessions has used the awesome powers of his office in <b>a</b> <b>shabby</b> attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly black voters." ...|$|E
2500|$|... many of {{the women}} and girls are dressed in finery, some in heavy makeup. All look {{directly}} at the camera, standing in front of overstuffed chairs or brocade curtains in what resembles <b>a</b> <b>shabby</b> hotel ballroom. Some are barely out of elementary school. Not one looks older than 30.|$|E
2500|$|In 1927, Margules took {{a lengthy}} {{leave of absence}} from his day job as a police {{reporter}} in order to travel to Paris, where he [...] "set up a studio in Montmartre's Place du Tertre, {{on the top floor of}} an almost deserted hotel, <b>a</b> <b>shabby</b> establishment, lacking both heat and running water." [...] He studied at the Louvre and traveled to paint landscapes in provincial France and North Africa.|$|E
60|$|Moore chucked me <b>a</b> very <b>shabby</b> little {{sheet of}} printed matter. It fluttered feebly {{in the warm}} air, and finally dropped on my {{recumbent}} frame. I was lolling in a hammock {{in the shade of}} the verandah.|$|R
5000|$|Bentley's {{was owned}} {{for some years}} by Oscar Owide, [...] "once one of London's favourites but in Owide's ownership, <b>a</b> rather <b>shabby</b> place". Owide still owned it in 2004. It was {{purchased}} by the chef Richard Corrigan in 2005.|$|R
60|$|As she was {{speaking}} I heard a sort of CLOOP, by which well-known sound I was aware that somebody was opening a bottle of wine, and Ponto entered, in a huge white neckcloth, and <b>a</b> rather <b>shabby</b> black suit.|$|R
