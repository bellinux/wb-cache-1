5|$|The {{idea behind}} the main plot was {{inspired}} by a scene from the novel Sometimes a Great Notion. However, the rock prop used was unpopular with the cast and crew, and post-production effects were required. The episode was the first of an ongoing plot thread with Nog entering Starfleet, which initially concerned Eisenberg as he thought he was being written out of the show. The episode was the fourth most watched episode of the third series, with 8.3 million viewers. Critical response was mixed, with negative comments directed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> the situation was created by the female Founder (Salome Jens).|$|E

25|$|The {{greatest}} {{difference between}} de Romieu’s Brief Discourse and Estienne’s Paradoxes {{can be found}} within the author’s voice. Marie de Romieu’s is distinctly a woman’s voice, showcasing true indignity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> it is women who lead men astray. She proceeds to thoroughly develop {{on the notion that}} men are at fault, attempting to seduce women with their wily ways. De Romieu then accuses them of blaming guileless women for the seduction they impose upon their innocence. She attributes the injustice to man’s ignorance, comparing him to a “cock who cannot distinguish between a pearl and a stone”. Furthermore, while Estienne’s audience was primarily masculine, de Romieu speaks to multiple audiences. She addresses women, including herself, as “us, women” and “we, my ladies”, as well as a universal and neutral “one”. She utilizes those when presenting dialogue in which a masculine voice presents arguments that are subsequently countered by her own female voice.|$|E

25|$|He {{was a major}} {{participant}} in the Rosebud campaign, and saw action in the Battle of the Rosebud. General George Crook and his officers, having retreated from the Rosebud, were hunting {{in the foothills of}} the Bighorns when Grouard, known to the Brulé as 'One-Who-Catches' and to the Hunkpapa as 'Standing Bear', was acting as guide. Between 9 and 10 in the morning of June 25, 1876 Crook's forces were in Goose Creek Valley when Grouard saw the smoke from Indian signal fires in the distance, which indicated that George Armstrong Custer's command was engaged with the enemy, outnumbered, and being badly pressed. The officers present used their field glasses but could make no sense of the smoke signals and laughed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> a half-Indian could have such knowledge of their meaning. To prove that he was right, at noon Grouard mounted his horse and rode towards the signals, reaching the Little Bighorn, a distance of some seventy miles, at 11 pm on June 25. Here he discovered the bodies of the slain before being chased back to Goose Creek by hostiles, bringing the news of Custer's death to Crook.|$|E

Sutcliffe expressed disbelief <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> O'Grady would continue to film his talk show, and with a studio audience, {{in the midst of}} planetary disaster, but nevertheless praised the cameos. After the cameos, he [...] "began to lose interest" [...] because he did not like the continuity and crossover elements of the episode.

500|$|The war in Europe had cast grave {{doubt on}} the Air Corps' {{doctrine}} that fighters could not shoot down bombers and the bomber will always get through. In the Battle of Britain the British Royal Air Force had demonstrated that it could shoot down bombers, while its own bomber force had suffered such heavy losses over Germany that it had abandoned daylight bombing in favor of night raids. Nonetheless, the planners held firm in their belief that, since American bombers were better armed and armored than their British or German counterparts, the bombers would get through, even in daylight, and that enemy fighter strength could be destroyed on the ground by bombing airbases and factories. [...] "Each of us," [...] Kuter wrote years later, [...] "scoffed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> fighters {{would be needed to}} protect bombers, to enable bombers to reach their objective.

500|$|On September 12, 2009, the EPB commemorated the {{birthday}} of Albizu. Noting that he died after being jailed, the organization insisted that justice was not yet made, expressing chagrin <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> some of the responsible were now regarded as historically influential people. The EBP then drew a parallel between the death of Albizu and Ojeda Ríos, accusing the local and federal authorities of complicity, {{as well as some}} pro-independence organization ms due to their silence on the matter. The group closed by claiming that the General Inspector's report tried to blame Ojeda Ríos for the actions of a FBI squad that [...] "wanted to eliminate the real representative of armed resistance [...] " [...] and compared it to the actions taken during the Romero Barceló administration in regards to the Cerro Maravilla murders, and expressed disbelief that despite cooperating with the federal agencies the local government, most notably the Police of Puerto Rico, concluded that the scene was not tampered when they only saw photographic evidence provided by the FBI. Noting that the Civil Rights Commission investigating the case questioned if the scene was tampered, the organization lamented that the report concluded that no criminal charges could be presented against the federal agent identified as [...] "Brian" [...] {{or any of the other}} involved.|$|E
500|$|Claims that Bury {{could have}} been the Ripper began to appear in {{newspapers}} shortly after Bury's arrest. Like Bury, the Ripper had inflicted abdominal wounds on his victims immediately after their deaths, and Bury lived in Bow, near Whitechapel, from October 1887 to January 1889, which placed him fairly near the Whitechapel murders at the appropriate time. The Dundee Advertiser of 12 February claimed that the Burys' [...] "neighbours were startled and alarmed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> one whom in their terror they associated with the Whitechapel tragedies had been living in their midst." [...] The New York Times of the same day connected Bury directly to the atrocities and reported the theory that William had murdered Ellen to prevent her from revealing his guilt, a story picked up and repeated by The Dundee Courier the following day. The Courier alleged that Bury admitted to Lieutenant Parr that he was Jack the Ripper, but Parr's version of the story says only that Bury said he was afraid he would be arrested as Jack the Ripper. Bury denied any connection, despite making a full confession to his wife's murder. Nevertheless, the executioner James Berry promoted the idea that Bury was the Ripper. Berry did not include Bury or the Ripper in his memoirs, My Experiences as an Executioner, but Ernest A. Parr, a journalist in the Suffolk town of Newmarket, wrote to the Secretary of State for Scotland on 28 March 1908 that Berry [...] "told me explicitly that Bury was known to have been Jack the Ripper".|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell enjoyed Raiden's role, commenting {{that his}} {{interactions}} with the other characters also helped expand Solid Snake's character. His introduction was given an award for [...] "Biggest Surprise" [...] by GameSpot in 2001, while Dave Meikleham from GamesRadar listed his appearance {{as one of the}} biggest plot twists in a video game since the trailers did not show him. Meikleham also called Raiden a [...] "surprisingly likeable character" [...] and found his dynamic with Solid Snake appealing. Den of Geek listed Raiden {{as one of the most}} sexually appealing video game characters noting his body appealing despite disappointing responses from Metal Gear characters. Before joining Kojima Productions Ryan Payton stated that he was not disappointed by Raiden's introduction, and liked the fact that the Metal Gear Solid 2 team kept his identity a secret. Raiden's English voice actor Quinton Flynn was surprised by fans' response to the character, but commented that it also attracted new fans to the series. Regarding response about Raiden replacing Snake as the main character, Flynn thought that fans were angry <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> Raiden would replace Snake for all subsequent games. Raiden's relationship with Rosemary was also listed as the most awkward part of the Metal Gear series by 1UP.com, with writer Scott Sharkey speculating about Hideo Kojima's life since the director claimed the relationship was autobiographical. PLAY editor Nick Jones listed the scene in which Raiden is nude as his fourth most favorite moment of the franchise, calling it the [...] "one of the funniest moments in gaming history."

Dmitri Malama gave Tatiana a French bulldog she named [...] "Ortipo" [...] in September 1914. [...] "Forgive me about the little dog," [...] Tatiana wrote to her mother on 30 September 1914. [...] "To say the truth, when he asked should I like to have it if he gave it to me, I at once said yes.
