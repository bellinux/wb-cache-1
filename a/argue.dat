5|$|Some {{critics and}} historians <b>argue</b> that one {{characteristic}} of the Silver Age was that science fiction and aliens replaced magic and gods. Others <b>argue</b> that magic was {{an important element of}} both Golden Age and Silver Age characters. Many Golden Age writers and artists were science-fiction fans or professional science-fiction writers who incorporated SF elements into their comic-book stories. Science was a common explanation for the origin of heroes in the Silver Age.|$|E
5|$|Alessandro Valignano, Visitor of the Society of Jesus in Asia, {{was one of}} {{the first}} Jesuits to <b>argue,</b> in the case of Japan, for an {{adaptation}} of Christian customs to the societies of Asia, through his Résolutions and Cérémonial.|$|E

5|$|Charles demanded {{not only}} the {{surrender}} of Lombardy, but also of Burgundy and Provence, forcing Francis to <b>argue</b> that French law prevented him from surrendering any lands possessed by the crown without the approval of Parlement, which would not be forthcoming.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Supreme Court's {{desire to}} resolve {{conflicts}} between circuit courts, legal scholars disagree about whether circuit splits are detrimental or beneficial. Some <b>argue</b> that circuit splits are harmful because they create confusion and encourage forum shopping, while other scholars <b>argue</b> that variation among circuits allows local courts {{to experiment with}} new laws that reflect the values of local residents. Scholars have also observed that regional variations in {{different areas of the}} United States have provided certain circuits with a particular specialization or expertise in some subjects of the law.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disparity}} with the Principate, Jones and Elton <b>argue</b> that 4th-century remuneration was attractive {{compared to the}} hard reality of existence at subsistence level that most recruits' peasant families had to endure. Against {{that has to be}} set the clear unpopularity of military service.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the recent}} successes in Cincinnati, the captive-breeding program has {{remained}} controversial. Proponents <b>argue</b> that the zoos {{have not only}} aided the conservation effort by studying the reproductive habits, raising public awareness and education about the rhinos, helping raise financial resources for conservation efforts in Sumatra but, moreover, to have established a small captive breeding group. Opponents of the captive breeding program <b>argue</b> that the losses are too great; the program is too expensive; removing rhinos from their habitat, even temporarily, alters their ecological role; and captive populations cannot match the rate of recovery seen in well-protected native habitats. In October 2015 Harapan, the last rhino in the Western Hemisphere, left the Cincinnati Zoo to Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Even so, {{there is}} no {{shortage}} of criticism against Beyonce's particular brand of feminism. Many critics <b>argue</b> that Beyonce is part of the hyper sexualization of women in the pop industry since the 90's, something that occurred largely in sync with the explosion of the porn industry. Beyond this, some feminist critics <b>argue</b> that Beyonce fuels a culture of post-feminism. With songs like Girls (Who Run the World), Beyonce creates a mindset - particularly among teenage girls - that women are already outdoing men in every aspect of life. When the reality is, these critics say, there are still vast gender inequalities that keep them from doing so. The danger of post-feminism is that while they still exist, young people lack the language to label these inequalities as sexism.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that hydrogen peroxide is abundant {{across much of}} the surface of Europa. Because hydrogen peroxide decays into oxygen and water when combined with liquid water, the authors <b>argue</b> that it could be an important energy supply for simple life forms.|$|E

5|$|From 1911 to 1917, {{money was}} {{collected}} for interior furnishings, which were relatively sparse {{apart from the}} impressive main altar. (These original furnishings remained until the 1930s.) Parts of the draft plan were abandoned: the floor was not constructed from marble as intended, but poured from plain concrete; outside there were no pinnacles on the façade. Writings vary on when the pinnacles were built: some claim they were built in 1923, but others <b>argue</b> {{that they were not}} completed until the renovation of the cathedral in 1999. Observers that <b>argue</b> for an earlier construction date state that they were damaged during World WarII and left dismantled for some time.|$|E
5|$|Gregory {{was one of}} {{the first}} theologians to <b>argue,</b> in {{opposition}} to Origen, that God is infinite. His main argument for the infinity of God, which can be found in Against Eunomius, is that God's goodness is limitless, and as God's goodness is essential, God is also limitless.|$|E
5|$|His {{bill passed}} this time, with {{a vote of}} 115 to 57, but if failed in the Senate. He {{continued}} to <b>argue</b> for settling Oregon {{throughout the rest of}} his term in Congress.|$|E

50|$|For the appeal, Professor Alan Dershowitz <b>argued</b> for Shirley Shawe, a 1% {{owner in}} the company. Dershowitz <b>argued</b> that Chancellor Bouchard's {{decision}} was tantamount to an illegal constitutional taking. Delaware Chief justice Leo Strine <b>argued</b> back to Dershowitz {{that he had}} no right to bring that up since it was not in the initial case, and the two <b>argued</b> over the law. The appeal affirmed Bouchard's decision.|$|R
5|$|Historians <b>argue</b> {{that the}} mass {{confiscation}} of Armenian properties {{was an important}} factor in forming the economic basis of the Turkish Republic while endowing Turkey's economy with capital.

Aravamudha Iyengar, {{includes}} reformist Brahmin characters that <b>argue</b> Nandan's case against their peers. Nandan also echoes the reformist ideas of Hindu spiritual leaders like Ramanuja and Vivekananda, and progressive upper-caste leaders.|$|E
5000|$|Robert Hochman <b>argued</b> {{the case}} for the petitioner. Assistant to the Solicitor General Matthew D. Roberts <b>argued</b> for the respondent. [...] Roberts <b>argued</b> that [...] "failure-to-report escape is similar in kind to {{burglary}} because it's purposeful, violent, and aggressive {{in the same way as}} burglary." [...] Roberts <b>argued</b> that failure to report is an invitation for a violent confrontation between the police and the felon.|$|R

50|$|The Convention Parliament met on 22 January 1689.
