40|$|In the {{northern}} part of Burkina Faso, in the Yatenga province, the water in several drinking wells contains arsenic. The arsenic originates from the bedrock and thus affects all those that depend on the deeply drilled tube wells for their daily water needs. Since arsenic is harmful to consume it is important to find a practical way of removing it. Furthermore, since Burkina Faso is one of the world´s poorest countries, the treatment technique has to be economically affordable. This study has evaluated a commercially available granular ferric hydroxide (GFH®) product as an arsenic <b>adsorbent</b> <b>material</b> when purifying arsenic-enriched water in Burkina Faso. The treatment method was based on a technique where arsenic-enriched water was pumped through a column packed with the <b>adsorbent</b> <b>material.</b> Previous investigations of this material and method have been performed on the water from {{the northern}} part of Burkina Faso; water from {{the northern part}} of the country was also used this time but the experiment was executed at a larger scale. With a flow rate of ten litres per hour through the column, the result showed an adsorption capacity of 370 micrograms arsenic per cubic centimetre adsorbent. The conclusion was that the GFH® worked well as an arsenic <b>adsorbent</b> <b>material.</b> In the future, it can probably be used in full scale systems but before that, more research and development have to be done. Some practical problems such as how to construct the set up, how to change the <b>adsorbent</b> <b>material,</b> what to do with the used <b>adsorbent</b> <b>material,</b> and how often to change it also need to be solved. Tests with lateritic soil from Burkina Faso as an <b>adsorbent</b> <b>material</b> were also executed. The advantages of using this lateritic soil instead of GFH® would be that it is less expensive and domestically available. With a flow rate of 0. 85 litres per hour the results of these tests showed an adsorption capacity of at least 5. 2 microgram arsenic per cubic centimetre material. Hence, the conclusion was that the natural lateritic soil had some potential to remove arsenic, but that the removal capacity was too low for natural lateritic soil to practically work as <b>adsorbent</b> <b>material</b> when using the column method. ...|$|R

50|$|SEC is used {{primarily}} {{for the analysis of}} large molecules such as proteins or polymers. SEC works by trapping smaller molecules in the pores of the <b>adsorbent</b> <b>materials</b> adsorption ("stationary phases"). This process is usually performed with a column, which consists of a hollow tube tightly packed with extremely small porous polymer beads designed to have pores of different sizes. These pores may be depressions on the surface or channels through the bead. As the solution travels down the column some particles enter into the pores. Larger particles cannot enter into as many pores. The larger the particles, the faster the elution. The larger molecules simply pass by the pores because those molecules are too large to enter the pores. Larger molecules therefore flow through the column more quickly than smaller molecules, that is, the smaller the molecule, the longer the retention time.|$|E

First use of PEI polymer in CO2 capture was devoted to improve the CO2 removal in space craft applications, impregnated over a polymeric matrix. After that, the support was changed to MCM-41, an hexagonal mesostructured silica, and large amounts of PEI were retained in the so-called [...] "molecular basket". MCM-41-PEI <b>adsorbent</b> <b>materials</b> led to higher CO2 adsorption capacities than bulk PEI or MCM-41 material individually considered. The authors claim that, in this case, a synergic effect takes place due to the high PEI dispersion inside the pore structure of the material. As a result of this improvement, further works were developed to study more in depth the behaviour of these materials. Exhaustive works have been focused on the CO2 adsorption capacity as well as the CO2/O2 and CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity of several MCM-41-PEI materials with PEI polymers. Also, PEI impregnation has been tested over different supports such as a glass fiber matrix [...] and monoliths. However, for an appropriate performance under real conditions in post-combustion capture (mild temperatures between 45-75°C and the presence of moisture) it is necessary to use thermally and hydrothermally stable silica materials, such as SBA-15, which also presents an hexagonal mesostructure. Moisture and real world conditions have also been tested when using PEI-impregnated materials to adsorb CO2 from the air.|$|E
