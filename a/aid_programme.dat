Programmes that emphasised bottom-up aid delivery mobilised local social capital and directed it toward obtaining resources that fit local needs and capabilities.

40|$|The main {{impetus for}} {{conducting}} research {{of this type}} was for the researcher {{to better understand the}} nature and types of EAP and HIV and <b>Aids</b> <b>programmes</b> that exist in the selected Gauteng Public Service departments. The researcher was motivated to choose this subject as she was employed by the Gauteng Department of Education and is currently employed by the Gauteng Department of Health of which these departments are the largest departments in the province and was able see both the similarities and differences between how the EAP and HIV and <b>Aids</b> Workplace <b>programmes</b> were being conducted. One similarity between the programmes is that both EAP and HIV and <b>Aids</b> Workplace <b>Programmes</b> are concerned with employee well-being with the aim of enhancement of the quality of work life and productivity. Employee assistance programmes commenced in Gauteng as a directive from the office of the Premier in 1999 (Gauteng Department of Education [GDE] Draft EAP Policy, 2003). This directive was the seed that led the development of both EAP and HIV and <b>Aids</b> Workplace <b>Programmes</b> in the Gauteng Province. This was a smart decision of investing its employee’s wellness and was strategically originating from the top structure within the province. In this research an exploratory study was undertaken in order to identify the relationship between EAP and HIV and <b>Aids</b> Workplace <b>Programmes</b> in nine Gauteng government departments. The survey design was used within the quantitative approach and use was made of a structured questionnaire. The study was made up of the responses elicited from 14 employees representing 9 state departments within the Gauteng Provincial Government. These respondents were directly responsible for both or either EAP and HIV and <b>Aids</b> Workplace <b>Programmes.</b> Applied research, considers a situation in practice to answer practical question about the EAP and HIV and <b>Aids</b> Workplace <b>Programmes</b> within GPG, was used. The researcher sent out sixteen questionnaires using a purposive sampling method to select respondents for this study. A discussion of the theoretical overview covered EAP and HIV and <b>Aids</b> Workplace <b>Programmes</b> in South Africa. This was further delineated to EAP and HIV and <b>Aids</b> Workplace <b>programmes</b> in the public sector and to the Gauteng Province. The research findings indicated that that the departments surveyed varied drastically in terms of employee size from 60000 to 292. The majority of the respondents were female and were EAP coordinators and the most frequent undertaken daily task was counselling, although many of the government departments had been making use of an external service provider to render an EAP service. Counselling was a service offered by the external service provider. Other findings were {{that the majority of the}} respondent’s had a university degree and many even had post-graduate qualifications. Almost all departments surveyed had policies that were relevant to EAP and HIV and <b>Aids</b> Workplace <b>Programmes</b> in place. The recommended requirements needed to sustain the EAP and HIV and <b>Aids</b> Workplace <b>programmes</b> include the following: • Locating the EAP and HIV and <b>Aids</b> Workplace <b>programmes</b> at top management level within the respective departments. • Combining the HIV and <b>Aids</b> Workplace <b>Programmes</b> and EAP under the banner of Employee Wellness. • Ensuring that these programmes are adequately resourced both in terms of budget and staff. • On-going marketing of the programmes to increase utilization. This research has highlighted the need for an integrated programme under the banner of wellness that can holistically serve the needs of employees. EAP and HIV and <b>Aids</b> Workplace <b>Programmes</b> practised in isolation are not as effective as a integrated customised programme designed to suit the individual requirements of an organization and its employees.
