The certificate binds the identity of a wireless smart device to the <b>anchor</b> <b>element</b> of its key chain; keys from the chain are used for computing message authentication codes (MACs) on messages sourced by the device. The authentication protocol requires a centralized infrastructure in the network: we describe the protocol in a hybrid wireless network with a satellite overlay interconnecting the wireless devices. The satellite is used as the Certificate Authority (CA) and also acts as the proxy for the senders in disclosing the MAC keys to the receivers. We also design a probabilistic nonrepudiation mechanism that utilizes the satellite's role as the CA and sender proxy. Through analysis, we show that the authentication protocol is secure against malicious adversaries. We also present detailed simulation results that demonstrate that the proposed protocol is much cheaper than traditional public key-based authentication technologies for metrics like processing delay, storage requirements, and energy consumption of the smart devices.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results in the research of the load-carrying ability of reinforced-concrete nonpressure pipes with inner lining intended to protect concrete against corrosion. The lining (covers) are mounted as a stay-in-place formwork when manufacturing the pipes. The covers are made of 3 - 5 mm thick polyethylene sheets. To be fixed in the pipe wall concrete, the linings are provided with special <b>anchoring</b> <b>elements.</b> Two lining types are considered: 1 – with <b>anchoring</b> <b>elements</b> {{in the form of}} solid longitudinal ribs; 2 – with <b>anchoring</b> <b>elements</b> distributed equidistantly over the shell surface (≈ 400 pcs/m 2). The research has been performed by numerical simulation using a three-dimentional finite element model. The load was applied according to a three-linear pattern used to test pipes for strength (including that specified in ЕN 1916). The computation was performed by the iteration method taking into account physical non-linearity of concrete. The computation makes allowance for formation and opening of cracks in the longitudinal pipe wall sections. The examples of computation of a pipe with the diameter of 2, 000 mm and wall thickness of 150 mm reinforced with two cylindrical cages and a pipe with the diameter of 1, 000 mm and wall thickness of 110 mm reinforced with a single cylindrical cage are given. It has been determined that the load-carrying ability of pipes with type 1 protective linings is lower than that of pipes with type 2 linings. Maximum (up to 25 %) reduction of the load-carrying ability is observed in pipes reinforced with a single cylindrical cage. In pipes of this type, cracks are formed at lower loads. The load-carrying ability of pipes is reduced due to entering of anchoring ribs of the protective shell into the compression zone of the pipe wall concrete in the sections located {{at the level of the}} horizontal diameter. The results of the numerical computation are in good agreement with those obtained when testing full-scale specimens of pipes with specified technical parameters. To protect interior faces of reinforced-concrete non-pressure pipes, it is recommended to use lining covers with V-type discrete anchoring members ensuring reliable mechanical fixing of the linings in the pipe wall concrete. This type of <b>anchoring</b> <b>elements</b> causes almost no effect upon the load-carrying ability of pipes...|$|R
40|$|A {{dynamically}} embedded {{plate anchor}} (DEPLA) is a rocket-shaped anchor that penetrates to a target depth in the seabed by the kinetic energy obtained through free-fall {{and by the}} anchor’s self-weight. After embedment, the central shaft is retrieved leaving the anchor flukes vertically embedded in the seabed. The flukes constitute the load bearing element as a plate anchor. This paper presents and considers field data on the embedment depth loss due to the plate anchor keying process and the subsequent bearing capacity factor of the plate <b>anchor</b> <b>element.</b> The loss in plate anchor embedment {{was significantly higher than}} that reported from corresponding centrifuge tests and is reflected in the larger padeye displacements required to mobilize peak capacity in the field tests. Measured plate capacities and plate rotations during keying indicate that the end of keying coincides with the peak anchor capacity. Experimental bearing capacity factors are in the range Nc = 14. 3 – 14. 6, which is appreciably higher than existing solutions for vanishingly thin circular plates. The higher Nc for the DEPLA is considered to be due to a combination of the cruciform fluke arrangement and the fluke (or plate) thickness...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sleep {{disturbance}} is a {{risk factor}} for somatic, psycho-social and spiritual dysfunction. It is also arguably the most deleterious effect of traffic noise pollution. Quantification of its burden is an <b>anchor</b> <b>element</b> of environmental policy making but no data are currently available for Bulgaria where the preponderance of dangerous nighttime noise exposure is highest in Europe. AIM: The aim {{of this study was to}} quantify the socio-economic burden of severe sleep disturbance due to traffic noise (road, aircraft and railway) in Bulgaria. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The official World Health Organization methodology used in Europe was applied in order to estimate this annual loss expressed as disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and their corresponding monetary value (assuming € 12 000 per DALY). RESULTS: Results showed that severe sleep disturbance due to all traffic sources was associated conservatively with 15 468 DALYs (8 839 - 22 097) and € 185 615 861 (€ 106 066 206 - € 265 165 516) lost in 2012, with road traffic being the single most important noise source. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, severe sleep disturbance due to traffic noise bears a heavy environmental and socio-economic burden in Bulgaria which prompts vigorous political action and greater involvement in environmental research. In order to increase the accuracy of future burden of disease analyses other studies would need to establish exposure-response functions based on population-based socio-acoustic surveys in the country...|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to quantify the}} reinforcement effect of the Makino bamboo (Phyllostachys makinoi Hayata) root system on the stability of slopeland through numerical analyses and in situ tests. Based on the field surveys of Makino bamboo root morphology, a three-dimensional (3 -D) numerical model of the soil-root system consisting of the reverse T-shape tap root and hair roots was developed and successfully applied to the finite element simulations of in situ pull-out tests. In the simulations, the soil mass was simulated by a soil element with a perfect elastic-plastic (or Mohr-Coulomb) material model whereas the root system was simulated by a ground <b>anchor</b> <b>element</b> with a linear elastic material model. In addition, a mechanical conversion model with simple mathematical form, which enables a direct transformation of the ultimate pull-out resistance into the shear strength increment of soil-root system was proposed. The conversion model offered a convenient way to quantify the reinforcement effect of the Makino bamboo root system required for the 3 -D slope stability analyses. The numerical {{results indicated that the}} shear strength increment of the Makino bamboo soil-root system ranged from 18. 4 to 26. 3 kPa and its effect on the slope stability was insignificant when compared with those adverse influence factors such as the steep slope angle (= 50 - 70 degrees), shallow root depth (= 0. 8 - 1. 0 m) and large growth height (> 10 m) of the Makino bamboo forest slopeland. It can be also speculated that the tension cracks widespread over the slope surface due to the wind loading acting on the bamboo stems and the sequential rainwater infiltration is the dominating factor in the collapse failure of slopeland. For a Makino bamboo forest slopeland with medium slope (25 degrees 40 degrees). Conclusively, the contribution of the Makino bamboo root system to the stability of slopeland is not as significant as expected. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the paper}} the {{activity}} of the research group in the field of the dynamic behaviour of Archimede’s Bridges is reviewed. The scope is twofold; on one hand the implications, in terms of structural analysis and design, of the results of this activity are summarized and discussed. On the other hand the needs for future research are defined. The general criteria adopted in the simulation of the dynamic response of the Archimede’s Bridge are first summarized. Attention is focused on “slow” dynamic actions; loading conditions due to impacts and internal or external explosions are thus not considered. The problem of seismic response is subsequently addressed; the problem of transverse response is discussed, {{especially in light of the}} anchoring system typology. It is then commented how another critical issue can be represented by the longitudinal motion of very long tunnels and, on design grounds, by the way of providing adequate restraint. Finally the aspects related to hydrodynamic excitation due to seabed motion (tsunamis and “seaquake”) are briefly presented especially in light of research development. The dynamic behaviour under wave and current excitation is addressed in the second part; the adopted wave models are briefly described along with the criteria for defining hydrodynamic forces; some results are shown illustrating the response to exceptional wind waves, with particular reference to the motion of the <b>anchoring</b> <b>elements.</b> The issue of vortex induced vibration is then treated, showing how long <b>anchoring</b> <b>elements</b> can be dangerously prone to activation of large oscillations, with the additional problem of high Reynolds numbers characterizing the fluid-structure interaction.
