They are very dense; a white dwarf's mass <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> {{to that of}} the Sun and its volume <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> {{to that of the}} Earth. Its faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy.|$|R
5|$|Archaeologists have {{attributed}} these circles to the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, {{and have}} noted that they <b>are</b> <b>comparable</b> to the stone circles found further south, in Dartmoor. However, {{in contrast to the}} two known Exmoor circles, over seventy such monuments have been identified on Dartmoor. This may be because Exmoor, unlike Dartmoor, has no natural granite. Instead it has Devonian slates and Hangman Grits, both of which easily break up into small slabs, resulting in a general shortage of big stones on Exmoor.|$|E
5|$|Benzylpiperazine (BZP) is a {{recreational}} drug with euphoriant and stimulant properties. The effects produced by BZP <b>are</b> <b>comparable</b> to those produced by amphetamine. Adverse effects {{have been reported}} following its use including acute psychosis, renal toxicity and seizures. No deaths have been reported following a sole ingestion of BZP, {{although there have been}} at least two deaths from the combination of BZP and MDMA. Its sale is banned in several countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Romania and other parts of Europe.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{relatively}} smaller brains {{compared to}} other primates, lemurs have demonstrated levels of technical intelligence in problem solving that <b>are</b> <b>comparable</b> to those seen in simians. However, their social intelligence differs, often emphasizing within-group competition over cooperation, which {{may be due to}} adaptations for their unpredictable environment. Although lemurs have not been observed using objects as tools in the wild, they can be trained to use objects as tools in captivity and demonstrate a basic understanding about the functional properties of the objects they are using.|$|E

5|$|In the {{original}} Final Fight, Poison and Roxy both utilized standing and acrobatic flip kicks {{to attack the}} player. As one of the fighters in Final Fight Revenge, her moveset was expanded heavily, and she was armed with a whip. The whip is used primarily in her Cat Claw and Thunder Whip attacks (which <b>are</b> <b>comparable</b> to Shoryuken/Shinryūken styled attacks, respectively), {{and can be used}} to steal a weapon from the opponent. Additionally, her handcuffs can be thrown as a horizontal projectile move to immobilize the opponent for a short time.|$|E
5|$|Observations of {{the surface}} have {{revealed}} {{that some of the}} molecular oxygen produced by radiolysis is not ejected from the surface. Because the surface may interact with the subsurface ocean (considering the geological discussion above), this molecular oxygen may make its way to the ocean, where it could aid in biological processes. One estimate suggests that, given the turnover rate inferred from the apparent ~0.5 Gyr maximum age of Europa's surface ice, subduction of radiolytically generated oxidizing species might well lead to oceanic free oxygen concentrations that <b>are</b> <b>comparable</b> to those in terrestrial deep oceans.|$|E
5|$|On the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) used by DEQ, {{water quality}} scores {{can vary from}} 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal).

These scores <b>are</b> <b>comparable</b> to the 1986 to 1995 results of 94 and 93. Despite the excellent ratings, the Chetco River actually ranks as the second most polluted stream in Curry County, after nearby Floras Creek, a tributary of the New River.|$|E
