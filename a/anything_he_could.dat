Since he was the only Dallas-based member of the press in camera car two, Grant directed his driver to the Trade Mart, where they saw no activity. A worker across the street said he saw a limousine speed past, accompanied by motorcycles with their sirens blaring; Grant knew immediately that they were headed to Parkland Memorial Hospital. Once at Parkland, Grant started snapping pictures of <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> including Vice President Johnson's car, and a man and a police officer delivering what Grant believed was blood plasma.|$|E
25|$|After {{a period}} of great {{productivity}} as a composer, he {{suffered a heart attack}} in 1973 and that same year he moved to Italy where he began a series of recordings which would span {{a period of}} five years. The music publisher Aldo Pagani, a partner in Curci-Pagani Music, had offered Piazzolla a 15-year contract in Rome to record <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> write. His famous album Libertango was recorded in Milan in May 1974 and later that year he separated from Amelita Baltar and in September recorded the album Summit (Reunión Cumbre) with the saxophonist Gerry Mulligan and an Italian orchestra, including jazz musicians such as bassist Pino Presti and drummer Tullio De Piscopo, in Milan. The album includes the composition Aire de Buenos Aires by Mulligan.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} {{in the days leading up}} to Survivor Series, however, McMahon began to reconsider that decision. Word of Hart's {{impending}} departure from the company had leaked to fans and wrestling news sources. McMahon was worried that allowing Hart to remain champion after the match at Survivor Series would cause problems and reckoned that Bischoff was still prone to doing <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to get under McMahon's skin and McMahon thought he would be likely to mention the signing of Hart to WCW on Nitro the following night (something Bischoff said would not have happened under normal circumstances). Furthermore, Bischoff would have a one-hour head start on McMahon due to Nitro going on the air live at 8 PM, which would have been more than enough time to announce Hart's WCW arrival. Therefore, McMahon felt, he needed to find a way to get the title off of Hart.|$|E

500|$|For the {{remainder}} of his career, much of Zappa's work was influenced by his use of the Synclavier as a compositional and performance tool. Even considering the complexity of the music he wrote, the Synclavier could realize <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> dream up. The Synclavier could be programmed to play almost anything conceivable, to perfection: [...] "With the Synclavier, any group of imaginary instruments can be invited to play the most difficult passages... with one-millisecond accuracy—every time". Even though it essentially did away with the need for musicians, Zappa viewed the Synclavier and real-life musicians as separate.|$|E

He had just adjourned the session {{for the day and}} was preparing to have a drink in House Speaker Sam Rayburn's office when he received an urgent message to go immediately to the White House. Truman assumed President Roosevelt wanted to meet with him, but Eleanor Roosevelt informed him her husband had died after suffering a massive cerebral hemorrhage. Truman's first concern was for Mrs. Roosevelt. He asked if there was <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do for her, to which she replied, [...] "Is there anything we can do for you?

500|$|Lane ran for Governor of California in 1902 on the Democratic and Non-Partisan tickets. [...] At a {{time when}} California was {{dominated}} by the Republican Party, he lost by less than a percentage point to George Pardee. (Theodore Roosevelt won the state by 35points two years later.) [...] Between 8,000 and 10,000votes were disqualified on various technicalities, possibly costing him the election. [...] During the campaign, the influential San Francisco Examiner slanted its news coverage against him. [...] Examiner owner William Randolph Hearst later denied responsibility for this policy, and stated that if Lane ever needed anything, he should send Hearst a telegram. [...] Lane retorted that if Hearst received a telegram purportedly signed by Lane, asking him to do <b>anything,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be {{sure it was a}} forgery.|$|E

Psychologist Joseph G Ponterotto, from second-hand sources, concludes that [...] "Bobby did not meet all the necessary criteria to reach diagnoses of schizophrenia or Asperger syndrome. The evidence is stronger for paranoid personality disorder." [...] Magnús Skúlason, a chess player and a psychiatrist and head doctor of Sogn Mental Asylum for the Criminally Insane, befriended Fischer {{toward the end of}} Fischer's life. From Endgame, Fischer's 2011 biography by Frank Brady: Skulason was not [...] "Bobby's psychiatrist", as has been implied in the general press, nor did he offer Bobby any analysis or psychotherapy. He was at Bobby's bedside as a friend, to try to do <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> for him. Because of his training, however, he couldn't fail to take note of Bobby's mental condition. [...] "He definitely was not schizophrenic", Skulason said. [...] "He had problems, possibly certain childhood traumas that had affected him. He was misunderstood. Underneath I think he was a caring sensitive person." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics lauded the {{development}} of the storyline between Shane and Rick. Writing for Best Week Ever, Dan Hopper stated that it presented a cold and eerie outlook {{on the future of the}} two men. Nate Rawlings of Time evaluated their physical confrontation as [...] "darn good", and Alex Crumb of The Faster Times called it [...] "wholly satisfying". Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich commended the fight scene; [...] "The Shane/Rick fight was great, a brilliantly extended scuffle that started out with an air of boys-will-be-boys pettiness but quickly escalated into something genuinely homicidal." [...] Goldman summated on the scene: [...] "Of course, it was also gratifying to finally see that conflict turn physical, with a fight we've been waiting to see for a long time. Rick vs. Shane was appropriately brutal and did a very good job of representing the two men's different tactics—Rick was no doubt a formidable and dangerous guy in a fight, wailing on Shane with a series of punches. But Shane was going for the kill, using <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> grab as a weapon, as he shoved a motorcycle onto Rick at one point and then threw a massive wrench at him in an effective, 'Holy S**t!' moment." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} later, John's wife Cynthia {{opened the door}} of Kenwood (their home in Weybridge) to see a man who [...] "looked like a tramp" [...] but, alarmingly, with John's face. Cynthia invited Alf in, and gave him tea and cheese on toast until John came home, which he was {{expected}} to do in an hour or so. While waiting, Cynthia offered to cut Alf's [...] "long, stringy locks" [...] of hair, which he allowed her to do. After waiting for a couple of hours, Alf left. John was annoyed when he came home, and told Cynthia (for the first time) about Alf's visit to the NEMS office a few weeks earlier. Later he relented slightly and contacted Alf over the next few months, telling Cynthia [...] "Alright, Cyn. He's a bit 'wacky', like me." [...] After Christmas, in 1965, John was embarrassed to hear that Alf had made a record: [...] "That's My Life (My Love and My Home)", released on 31 December 1965. John asked Epstein to do <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to stop it being released or becoming a hit. The record never made it into the charts. In 1966 [...] "Freddie Lennon" [...] (the name under which Alf recorded) tried again, and issued three singles with the group Loving Kind. These records did not sell well, either. Though the public at large quickly forgot these attempts to cash in on his son's success with the Beatles, the records do command fairly high prices among collectors of rare records, with [...] "That's My Life" [...] being worth over £50.|$|E
500|$|Three {{days after}} Frederick was {{confirmed}} to {{be suffering from}} cancer, his father Kaiser William I died aged 90 at 8:22 a.m. on 9 March 1888, upon which Frederick became German Emperor and King of Prussia. His son Wilhelm, now Crown Prince, telegraphed the news to his father in Italy. Later the same day, Frederick wrote in his diary that he had received the telegram upon returning from a walk, [...] "...and so I have ascended the throne of my forefathers and of the German Kaiser! God help me fulfill my duties conscientiously and for the weal of my Fatherland, in both the narrower and the wider sense." [...] Germany's progressive elements hoped that William's death, and thus Frederick's succession, would usher the country into a new era governed along liberal lines. Logically, Frederick should have taken as his regnal name either Frederick I (if the Bismarckian empire was considered a new entity) or Frederick IV (if it was considered {{a continuation of the}} old Holy Roman Empire, which had had three emperors named Frederick); he himself preferred the latter. However, on the advice of Bismarck that this would create legal problems, he opted to simply keep the same regnal name he had as king of Prussia. The new Kaiser reached Berlin at 11 p.m. on the night of 11 March; those who saw him were horrified by his [...] "pitiful" [...] appearance. The question now was how much longer the mortally ill emperor could be expected to live, and what, if <b>anything,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hope to achieve. In spite of his illness, Frederick did his best to fulfill his obligations as Emperor. Immediately after the announcement of his accession, he took the ribbon and star of his Order of the Black Eagle from his jacket and pinned it on the dress of his wife; he was determined to honor her position as Empress. Too ill to march in his father's funeral procession, he was represented by Wilhelm, the new Crown Prince, while he watched, weeping, from his rooms in the Charlottenburg Palace.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{difficulties}} with sampling, {{the band and}} production team eventually became comfortable with it, even sampling Mullen's drumming, the Edge's guitar riffs, Clayton's bass lines, and Bono's vocalisations. Howie B sampled almost <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{in order to find}} interesting sounds. He created sequenced patterns of the Edge's guitar playing, which the guitarist, having never done it before, found very interesting. Howie B explained, [...] "Sometimes I would sample, say, a guitar, but it wouldn't come back sounding like a guitar; it might sound more like a pneumatic drill, because I would take the raw sound and filter it, really destroy the guitar sound, and rebuild it into something completely different." [...] Although sequencing was used, mostly on keyboards, guitar loops, and some percussion, it was used sparingly out of fear of becoming overreliant on it.|$|E

2500|$|In an 1834 {{letter to}} Silliman, Morey wrote: “It {{is now more}} than twenty years since I have been in the constant, I may say daily {{practice}} of making experiments on the decomposition of water, by mixing with its vapor that of spirits of turpentine, and a great portion of atmospheric air.” This would seem to understate the scope of some research that led to such diverse discoveries as the liquid fueled internal combustion engine, a method for carbonating water, and odd bubbles formed by molten resin. The last two appeared in journals in England and Germany, respectively. Morey noted differences in flames near knots, perhaps rich in sap, or in wet wood. Eventually he experimented with <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> find: “tar, rosin, rough turpentine, or the spirit, or alcohol, or any kind of oil, fat, or tallow; mineral coal, pitch-pine wood, and the knots, birch bark, pumpkin, sun-flower, flax, and other seeds; as well as many other substances.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Having {{received}} a short {{ball to the}} helmet from De Villiers during his brief innings, Devon Malcolm came out to bowl all fired up, allegedly having told De Villiers [...] "You guys are history!", [...] He demolished the South African batting. [...] He ripped out Peter and Gary Kirsten and Hansie Cronje before the tourists {{had a chance to}} draw breath, leaving them 1/3. [...] Wessels and Cullinan stabilised the innings, but the captain was next to go, also to Malcolm, and Cullinan's approach seemed to be to attack <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> - as the only batsman capable of fending Malcolm off, his innings of 94 (134 balls, 12 boundaries) was immense, and with DeFreitas bowling niggardly spells whenever Malcolm had to rest, the South Africans had no respite. [...] Meanwhile, McMillan (25), Richardson and Matthews all fell to the Derbyshire quickly, and although Jonty Rhodes came in to bat at number nine, no one else could stem the tide of wickets. [...] Cullinan eventually went to Gough, and Malcolm cleaned up De Villiers and Donald, to finish with figures of 9 for 57, the fourth best Test bowling analysis by an England bowler.|$|E
2500|$|Family {{formed in}} Late 1966 in Leicester, England from the {{remaining}} {{members of a}} group that was previously known as The Farinas and later briefly The Roaring Sixties, whose sound was grounded in R. The Farinas originally consisted of John [...] "Charlie" [...] Whitney, Tim Kirchin (born c. 1944, Birstall, Leicestershire died c. 2000), Harry Ovenall (born Richard Harry Ovenall, 12 September 1943, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire) and Jim King, forming at Leicester Art College in 1962. Ric Grech replaced Kirchin on bass in 1965 and Roger Chapman joined the following year on vocals. The American record producer Kim Fowley suggested they call themselves [...] "The Family" [...] as they regularly wore double-breasted suits in performances, giving themselves a mafia appearance, a look they soon abandoned in favour a more casual dress code. They played the famous Marquee Club regularly and other London clubs including The Hundred Club and the famous Sybilla's in Swallow Street where they met Henrietta Guinness who introduced them into society. On meeting Mim Scala who they had known before, Scala asked if there was <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do for them. Because they were looking for material at the time, and probably a producer, Ovenall asked Scala if he could arrange for Jimmy Miller to produce the first single which he duly did. Scala also introduced them to John Gilbert, who from then on took over managing the band. Thanks to Miller, Steve Winwood and other members of Traffic participated in the recording. Shortly after the recording and before the release, Ovenall voiced his concern over the movement away from their black musical roots i.e. blues, R, soul. In fact around 1965 The Farinas had publicity cards saying [...] "Farinas Soul and Roll". The single seemed to be going towards psychedelia, emphasised by the use of a phono fiddle borrowed from an Oxford Street busker, and played by Ric Grech. His concerns also included the role of management in the band. A meeting of the band was called, during which it was suggested that Ovenall's heart was no longer in the band and as a consequence he walked away from the band. Contrary to several reports he was not asked to leave the band. Family's debut single [...] "Scene Through The Eye of a Lens/Gypsy Woman", produced by Jimmy Miller and released by Liberty Records in October 1967, was not a success. Drummer Ovenall was replaced by Rob Townsend.|$|E
