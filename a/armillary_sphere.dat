5|$|<b>Armillary</b> <b>sphere,</b> hydraulic-powered: Hipparchus (c. 190– c. 120 BC) {{credited}} the Ancient Greek mathematician, geographer, astronomer, {{and poet}} Eratosthenes (276–194 BC) {{as the first}} to invent the <b>armillary</b> <b>sphere</b> representing the celestial sphere. However, the Chinese astronomer Geng Shouchang of the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) invented it separately in China in 52 BC, while the Han dynasty polymath Zhang Heng (78–139 AD) {{was the first to}} apply motive power to the rotating <b>armillary</b> <b>sphere</b> by a set of complex gears rotated by a waterwheel which in turn was powered by the constant pressure head of an inflow clepsydra clock, the latter of which he improved with an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel.|$|E
5|$|The Han-era Chinese {{also made}} star catalogues, such as {{historian}} Sima Qian's (145–86 BCE) A Monograph on Celestial Officials (Tianguanshu 天官書) and Zhang Heng's 2nd-century-CE star catalogue which featured roughly 2,500 stars and 124 constellations. To create a three-dimensional representation of such observations, Astronomer Geng Shouchang (耿壽昌) provided his <b>armillary</b> <b>sphere</b> with an equatorial ring in 52 BCE. By 84 CE the elliptical ring {{was added to}} the <b>armillary</b> <b>sphere,</b> while Zhang Heng's model of 125 CE added the celestial horizon ring and meridian ring.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese flag {{displays}} {{three important}} symbols: the field colours, and the <b>armillary</b> <b>sphere</b> and national shield, {{which make up}} the coat of arms.|$|E

50|$|Sir Henry, {{like most}} courtiers of the day, had a {{portrait}} painted by a leading artist. In Lee's picture, his sleeves {{are decorated with}} <b>armillary</b> <b>spheres,</b> a symbol of wisdom and also his device as queen's champion. His sleeves are also decorated with lovers knots which, combined with the <b>armillary</b> <b>spheres</b> {{can be seen to}} represent his love for learning (the wisdom of the <b>armillary</b> <b>spheres)</b> and for the Queen (his symbol as her champion). Lee also wears several rings tied to his arm, and has his finger through a third ring around his neck. This may represent his marriages, and the third ring, which is not quite on his finger, may represent his relationship with Anne Vavasour.|$|R

5|$|In his writing, Su Song credited, as the {{predecessor}} of his working clock, the hydraulic-powered <b>armillary</b> <b>sphere</b> of Zhang Heng (78–139 AD), an earlier Chinese scientist. Su Song was also {{strongly influenced by}} the earlier <b>armillary</b> <b>sphere</b> created by Zhang Sixun (976 AD), who also employed the escapement mechanism and used liquid mercury instead {{of water in the}} waterwheel of his astronomical clock tower (since liquid mercury would not freeze during winter and would not corrode and rust metal components over time). However, Su Song stated in his writing that after Zhang's death, no one was able to replicate his device, much like his own.|$|E
5|$|During the 11th {{century in}} the Song Dynasty, the Chinese astronomer, horologist and {{mechanical}} engineer Su Song created a water-driven astronomical clock for his clock tower of Kaifeng City. It incorporated an escapement mechanism {{as well as the}} earliest known endless power-transmitting chain drive, which drove the <b>armillary</b> <b>sphere.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves {{ceased to}} exist in 1822, when Brazil became independent, its coat of arms {{continued}} to be used, inclusive in flags, until the death of John VI in 1826. From then on, the previous coat of arms, without the <b>armillary</b> <b>sphere,</b> became in use again.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese shield rests {{over the}} <b>armillary</b> <b>sphere.</b> Except {{during the reign}} of Afonso I, it is present in every single {{historical}} flag, in one form or another. It is the prime Portuguese symbol as well as one of the oldest, with the first elements of today's shield appearing {{during the reign of}} Sancho I. The evolution of the Portuguese flag is inherently associated with the evolution of the shield.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the astronomical}} <b>armillary</b> <b>sphere</b> (representing the {{celestial}} sphere) existed in China since the 1st century BCE, the mathematician and court astronomer Zhang Heng (78–139 CE) provided it with motive power {{by using the}} constant pressure head of an inflow water clock to rotate a waterwheel that acted {{on a set of}} gears. Zhang Heng was also the first {{to address the problem of}} the falling pressure head in the inflow water clock (which gradually slowed the timekeeping) by setting up an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel.|$|E
50|$|Further {{advances}} in the instrument were made by Tycho Brahe (1546-1601), whose elaborate <b>armillary</b> <b>spheres</b> passing into astrolabes are figured in his Astronomiae Instauratae Mechanica.|$|R
50|$|<b>Armillary</b> <b>spheres</b> were {{developed}} by the Greeks and were used as teaching tools already in the 3rd century BC. In larger and more precise forms they were also used as observational instruments.|$|R

5|$|John II was {{succeeded by}} his first cousin Manuel I, in 1495. This king {{was the first to}} convert the {{traditional}} square armorial banner into a rectangular (2:3) field with the coat of arms on its centre. Specifically, the flag was now a white rectangle centrally charged with the coat of arms (bearing eleven castles) on an ogival or heater-shaped shield and surmounted by an open royal crown. This flag was used exclusively as the kingdom's banner since Manuel I possessed a personal standard which included the <b>armillary</b> <b>sphere</b> for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Technology {{during the}} Tang period was built also upon the {{precedents}} of the past. Advancements in clockworks and timekeeping included the mechanical gear systems of Zhang Heng (78–139) and Ma Jun (fl. 3rd century) gave the Tang engineer, astronomer, and monk Yi Xing (683–727) inspiration when he invented the world's first clockwork escapement mechanism in 725. This was used alongside a clepsydra clock and waterwheel to power a rotating <b>armillary</b> <b>sphere</b> in representation of astronomical observation. Yi Xing's device {{also had a}} mechanically timed bell that was struck automatically every hour, and a drum that was struck automatically every quarter-hour; essentially, a striking clock. Yi Xing's astronomical clock and water-powered <b>armillary</b> <b>sphere</b> became well known throughout the country, since students attempting to pass the imperial examinations by 730 had to write an essay on the device as an exam requirement. However, {{the most common type}} of public and palace timekeeping device was the inflow clepsydra. Its design was improved c. 610 by the Sui-dynasty engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai. They provided a steelyard balance that allowed seasonal adjustment in the pressure head of the compensating tank and could then control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night.|$|E
5|$|While {{working in}} the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo's {{interest}} in archaeology and old relics led him to reconstruct an <b>armillary</b> <b>sphere</b> from existing models {{as well as from}} ancient texts that could provide additional information. Shen used ancient mirrors while conducting his optics experiments. He observed ancient weaponry, describing the scaled sight devices on ancient crossbows and the ancients' production of swords with composite blades that had a midrib of wrought iron and low-carbon steel while having two sharp edges of high-carbon steel. Being a knowledgeable musician, Shen also suggested suspending an ancient bell by using a hollow handle. In his assessment of the carved reliefs of the ancient Zhuwei Tomb, Shen stated that the reliefs demonstrate genuine Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD) era clothing.|$|E

50|$|His {{professional}} life was largely spent in Augsburg {{where he made}} navigational instruments such as astrolabes, quadrants, and <b>armillary</b> <b>spheres.</b> He also invented a portable sundial that adjusted to operate on different latitudes between England and Italy.|$|R
50|$|In {{its current}} form, the device dates {{the second half}} of the 16th century, and its structure, as well its name, is {{reminiscent}} of mechanisms of the era, commonly used in Spain, such as boxes, globes, and <b>armillary</b> <b>spheres.</b>|$|R
5|$|During a hailstorm in Washington state, {{university}} students run to find shelter. One girl, Lauren (Kristi Angus), {{stands in the}} rain, lights a cigarette, and goes up in flames. Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) travels to the university to interview witnesses to the death. A teaching assistant tells Black that the dead girl was highly intelligent, pointing out an <b>armillary</b> <b>sphere</b> Lauren had constructed. She also tells Black that the previous Millennium Group contact had taken great interest in this sphere. Black did not realize the Group had sent another member, but on leaving, he meets the man in question—Dennis Hoffman (Brad Dourif). Hoffman describes his theories to Black, detailing how when several planets achieve syzygy on May 5, 2000, a series of natural disasters will bring {{about the end of}} the world. Hoffman believes that this cataclysm will be preceded by strange events and weather patterns.|$|E
5|$|The Han dynasty was {{an age of}} {{economic}} prosperity and saw a significant growth of the money economy first established during the Zhou dynasty (c.1050–256 BC). The coinage issued by the central government mint in 119 BC remained the standard coinage of China until the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). The period saw a number of limited institutional innovations. To pay for its military campaigns and the settlement of newly conquered frontier territories, the government nationalized the private salt and iron industries in 117 BC, but these government monopolies were repealed during the Eastern Han period. Science and technology during the Han period saw significant advances, including papermaking, the nautical steering rudder, the use of negative numbers in mathematics, the raised-relief map, the hydraulic-powered <b>armillary</b> <b>sphere</b> for astronomy, and a seismometer employing an inverted pendulum.|$|E
5|$|The {{equatorial}} ring {{goes around}} {{the belly of the}} <b>armillary</b> <b>sphere</b> 91 and 5/19 (degrees) away from the pole. The circle of the ecliptic also goes round the belly of the instrument at an angle of 24 (degrees) with the equator. Thus at the summer solstice the ecliptic is 67 (degrees) and a fraction away from the pole, while at the winter solstice it is 115 (degrees) and a fraction away. Hence (the points) where the ecliptic and the equator intersect should give the north polar distances of the spring and autumn equinoxes. But now (it has been recorded that) the spring equinox is 90 and 1/4 (degrees) away from the pole, and the autumn equinox is 92 and 1/4 (degrees) away. The former figure is adopted only because it agrees with the (results obtained by the) method of measuring solstitial sun shadows as embodied in the Xia (dynasty) calendar.|$|E

This is especially apparent in its elaborate rib vaulting, crosses of the Order of Christ, <b>armillary</b> <b>spheres</b> and twisted rope, common to the nautically inspired organic Manueline style.|$|R
5|$|The series' title {{sequence}} {{was created}} by production studio Elastic for HBO. Creative director Angus Wall and his collaborators received the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Main Title Design for the sequence, which depicts a three-dimensional map of the series' fictional world. The map is projected {{on the inside of}} a sphere which is centrally lit by a small sun in an <b>armillary</b> <b>sphere.</b> As the camera moves across the map, focusing on the locations of the episode's events, clockwork mechanisms intertwine and allow buildings and other structures to emerge from the map. Accompanied by the title music, the names of the principal cast and creative staff appear. The sequence concludes after about 90 seconds with the title card and brief opening credits indicating the episode's writer(s) and director. Its composition changes as the story progresses, with new locations replacing those featuring less prominently or not at all.|$|E
5|$|What {{were the}} factors {{leading to the}} first {{escapement}} clock in China? The chief tradition leading to Yi Xing (AD 725) was of course the succession of 'pre-clocks' which had started with Zhang Heng about 125. Reason has been given for believing that these applied power to the slow turning movement of computational armillary spheres and celestial globes {{by means of a}} water-wheel using clepsydra drip, which intermittently exerted the force of a lug to act on the teeth of a wheel on a polar-axis shaft. Zhang Heng in his turn had composed this arrangement by uniting the armillary rings of his predecessors into the equatorial <b>armillary</b> <b>sphere,</b> and combining it with the principles of the water-mills and hydraulic trip-hammers which had become so widespread in Chinese culture in the previous century.|$|E
5|$|With the {{invasion}} of Portugal by Napoleon's imperial army in 1807, the Portuguese Royal Court fled to Brazil, establishing {{the capital of the}} Portuguese Monarchy and Empire in Rio de Janeiro. In 1815, the Portuguese state of Brazil was elevated to a kingdom, thus receiving the same status as the Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarves. The whole of the Portuguese Monarchy became then the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. To reflect the change of the status of the Portuguese Monarchy, the Prince Regent John (future King John VI, at that time still reigning in name of his mother, Queen Mary I) established a new Royal coat of arms, where the Portuguese shield (representing Portugal and the Algarves) charged a blue-filled yellow <b>armillary</b> <b>sphere</b> (representing Brazil) surmounted by the same beret-bearing five-arched crown. The new coat of arms replaced the previous one in the Portuguese flags.|$|E
