40|$|We have {{investigated}} whether acid-mediated bile acid precipitation, pancreatic enzyme inactivation, and fatty acid partitioning occur in health when intraluminal pH falls below 5. In {{order to assess}} lipolysis and aqueous solubilisation of lipid, we first developed a new technique for inactivating lipase in jejunal aspirate (acid inactivation), {{and showed it to}} be more effective and simpler than the established technique (heat inactivation). We then studied 14 healthy subjects, aspirating jejunal content for three hours after a liquid meal, and pooling according to pH. Eighteen per cent of the total aspirate was collected <b>at</b> pH <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 5 compared with 56 % at pH greater <b>than</b> 6 (p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 01). Forty eight per cent of the bile acids were precipitated <b>at</b> pH <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 5 compared with 18 % at pH greater <b>than</b> 6 (p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 01), leading to a reduction in aqueous phase bile acid concentration at low pH (2. 1 mmol/l <b>at</b> pH <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 5 vs 5. 8 mmol/l at pH greater <b>than</b> 6, p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 01). Lipase activity was reduced at low pH (133 IU/l <b>at</b> pH <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 5 vs 182 IU/l at pH greater <b>than</b> 6, p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 01), leading to reduced lipolysis at low pH (14 % <b>at</b> pH <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 5 vs 32 % at pH greater <b>than</b> 6, p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 01). Aqueous phase lipid concentration was reduced at low pH (3. 5 mmol/l <b>at</b> pH <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 5 vs 12. 5 mmol/l at pH greater <b>than</b> 6, p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 01). This reduction was less dependent on bile acid precipitation than on lipase inactivation and fatty acid partitioning. We conclude that intraluminal acidity influences aqueous solubilisation of bile acids and lipid in health...|$|R

5|$|Like {{all other}} large whales, the fin whale was heavily hunted during the 20th century {{and is an}} {{endangered}} species. Over 725,000 fin whales were reportedly taken from the Southern Hemisphere between 1905 and 1976; as of 1997 only 38,000 survived. Recovery of the overall population size of southern species is predicted to be <b>at</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 50% of its pre-whaling state by 2100 due to heavier impacts of whaling and slower recovery rates.|$|E

5|$|The {{safety issues}} for {{cryogenic}} helium {{are similar to}} those of liquid nitrogen; its extremely low temperatures can result in cold burns, and the liquid-to-gas expansion ratio can cause explosions if no pressure-relief devices are installed.

Because the hurricane moved through the New York Shipping Channel, numerous ships reported winds of over hurricane status, though winds remained below tropical storm force on land. A boat capsized {{off the coast of}} Jones Beach Island, though its passengers were not injured.

In Delaware, rough surf closed numerous coastal beaches, while storm tides and waves flooded a campground near the Indian River in Sussex County.
