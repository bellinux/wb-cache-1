He remarks, [...] "there is something compelling about Black's strategy. He seems to be saying: 'I will copy all your good moves, and as soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> a bad move, I won't copy you any more!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Part of the game's {{inspiration}} {{came from}} the fantasy worlds that the lyrics and album covers of metal bands implied but rarely made it to music videos, thus allowing Brütal Legend to [...] "fulfill the promise" [...] of such lore. Schafer also credits a Megadeth roadie named Tony he once met as having given him the idea to make a game about a roadie, with the character of Eddie Riggs becoming a re-imagined version of him. Schafer had previously explored {{the idea of a}} roadie sent back in time with the character of Hoagie from Day of the Tentacle, but Brütal Legend represented an opportunity to expand on it further. The 2003 movie School of Rock also reminded Schafer of his idea for Brütal Legend, and made him more excited to publish it. [...] Double Fine's philosophy on game development was also another reason for Brütal Legends creation, as Schafer has stated that his team attempts to make each game radically different from the company's previous release, contrasting Brütal Legend to Psychonauts. Schafer stated that the commercial tie-ins of Brütal Legend, such as [...] "hot babes and Jack Black", is due to this philosophy and not due to market pressures. Schafer was not concerned about the commercial success of Brütal Legend, as despite poor sales of Psychonauts, [...] "as long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> a cool game, publishers want to talk to you". When Schafer was pitching the game before 2006, he received feedback about changing the game's style to hip hop or country. He credits Harmonix Music Systems for influencing the rhythm game market through the release of the widely successful Guitar Hero with a soundtrack that heavily emphasized metal music; with the popularity of Guitar Hero, the metal approach in Brütal Legend was readily accepted.|$|E
2500|$|Japanese, Italian and Nazi {{aggression}} that precipitated World War II {{often is}} cited as an argument against pacifism. If these forces {{had not been}} challenged and defeated militarily, the argument goes, many more people would have died under their oppressive rule. Adolf Hitler told the British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax in 1937 that the British should [...] "shoot Gandhi, and if this doesn't suffice to reduce them to submission, shoot a dozen leading members of the Congress, and if that doesn't suffice shoot 200, and so on, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> it clear that you mean business." ...|$|E

2500|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{his career}} he also began to act in various films. In 1963, {{director}} Otto Preminger asked if he would portray a Boston prelate in The Cardinal, and, writes author Philip Kemp, he [...] "virtually stole the picture." [...] He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role. He had a little participation (as did many others) in 1967's Casino Royale as actor and director. He acted in Roman Polanski's Chinatown (1974) as the film's master villain, and as Teddy Roosevelt's secretary of state John Hay in The Wind and the Lion. Huston enjoyed acting and denied that he took it all that seriously. [...] "It's a cinch," [...] he once said, [...] "and they pay you damn near as much <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> directing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{sedation}} concerned {{people in}} Russia {{as well as}} the West that the former Soviet Union was returning to its Cold War-era methods of silencing dissent. Tylik said that he had told her six days before the disaster that the submarine had [...] " [...] 'death onboard,' but he didn't explain what he meant." [...] "I am sure that the commanders of the Northern Fleet knew that the torpedoes were not in order. Those who are guilty must be punished. Navy officials in Vidyayevo later confirmed to The Times and to The St. Petersburg Times that she was given a sedative. [...] "We've been giving sedatives to relatives since this began, and it is not such a big deal <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> it out to be in the West," [...] said an officer who would not identify himself. [...] "We are simply protecting the relatives from undue pain – it was for her own protection." ...|$|E
