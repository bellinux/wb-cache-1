500|$|Cyrus never sang [...] "Hoedown Throwdown" [...] live during {{televised}} events, {{but often}} performed the {{dance with the}} track on playback. On April 3, 2009, Cyrus performed [...] "Hoedown Throwdown" [...] on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Cyrus performed the dance on Good Morning America on April 8, 2009. On April 10, 2009, Cyrus danced to the track {{with some of the}} movie's castmates on The Tyra Banks Show. Preceded by a performance of [...] "Let's Get Crazy" [...] as herself and succeeded by [...] "These Four Walls", Cyrus performed [...] "Hoedown Throwdown" [...] as part of her set list in her first worldwide concert tour, the Wonder World Tour. For the performances Cyrus dressed in a short white tutu-like dress and performed the dance with her background dancers. Mid-way through the song, will.i.am appeared on the screens to congratulate Cyrus and continued speaking <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> stage. When he finished, the dancers performed to a remix of [...] "Boom Boom Pow" [...] by The Black Eyed Peas.|$|E

500|$|Leading music {{production}} of the second season of Fargo were composer Jeff Russo and newly appointed music supervisor Marguerite Phillips. Phillips was hired immediately after her first meeting with Hawley, in a text which she received <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> building. Together, they brainstormed ideas on the season's musical direction; progressive rock, krautrock, Jethro Tull, and The Runaways were among several early suggestions. Phillips spent months conducting research, [...] "dicking around and 'going down rabbit holes'" [...] for the obscure music choices, until ultimately narrowing down the selection of music from a master playlist. Russo employed various compositional and recording techniques to build a distinctive retro sound. The soundtrack features songs by: Billy Thorpe, Burl Ives, Cris Williamson, Devo, Jeff Wayne, Yamasuki, Blitzen Trapper, Shakey Graves, White Denim, and Bobby Womack, {{as well as one}} cover version—Emmylou Harris, Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch's [...] "Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby" [...] performed by Hawley. The use of [...] "War Pigs" [...] by Black Sabbath in the opening scenes of the season finale received acclaim. Russo also recorded music with the University of Southern California (USC) marching band at Hawley's request.|$|E
500|$|The main show {{commenced}} with Cyrus {{emerging from}} the bottom of the stage inside a large, crystal-like glacier. She wore a black leather hot pantsuit, a tank top, and a white fur vest with a silver sequined hood as she escaped the cocoon to perform the concert's opening number, [...] "Breakout". Numerous backup dancers accompanied her and, towards the conclusion, she performed atop movable scaffolding. After removing the fur vest, Cyrus performed [...] "Start All Over" [...] atop the scaffolding and continued the remainder of the first segment of the show with [...] "7 Things" [...] and [...] "Kicking and Screaming". Cyrus then executed the show's second segment with a performance of [...] "Bottom of the Ocean", which featured an aquatic theme for the stage and Cyrus donning a silver, flowing evening gown that bared a bejeweled bodysuit underneath. The performance ended with Cyrus diving into the stage, succeeded by a simulation of her underwater on the video screens. Cyrus returned to the stage for the show's third segment atop a tractor-resembling car to perform [...] "Fly on the Wall". During the performance, Cyrus wore an extravagant white dress with a feathered skirt. Backup dancers were flown up into contact with panels in order to resemble a fly on a window; meanwhile, Cyrus was flown across the arena. Once back in the stage, Cyrus and backup dancers performed a brief dance interlude of Michael Jackson's [...] "Thriller" [...] (1984). Replacing the feathered bottom with a tutu, Cyrus performed the Hannah Montana-credited song [...] "Let's Get Crazy" [...] and [...] "Hoedown Throwdown". The latter was followed by a video in which will.i.am of The Black Eyed Peas spoke about Cyrus, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> stage. When the video was completed, the dancers performed a remix of the Black Eyed Peas' [...] "Boom Boom Pow" [...] (2009).|$|E
500|$|Several {{factors have}} led to {{speculation}} that Webster was not alone when he killed Leigh. According to the transcript of Webster's confession, he was never asked if he acted alone. Carrington accused police of accepting Webster's confession at face value, ignoring both forensic and witness evidence. Her investigations highlighted several discrepancies in Webster's confession, and in the forensic evidence. For example, Webster stated in his confession that he had choked Leigh {{with his left hand}} as he knelt beside her although, according to the autopsy report, the bruises on Leigh's neck were consistent with being choked with a right hand. Carrington also questioned Webster's statement that he walked along lit streets {{to the other side of}} the Stockton peninsula to wash his bloodstained hands, when he could have washed his hands in total darkness at the beach less than [...] away. She also queried his claim that he had blood on his hands but none on his clothes, despite Leigh having been struck so hard blood was splattered 2.8 metres one way from her body and 1.3 metres the other way. Webster stated that he walked to the beach with Leigh, though according to police reports four witnesses said she walked to the beach alone; two witnesses stated they saw Webster and Wilson leave the surf club together. Neither NC1 nor Wilson had a reliable alibi for their whereabouts at the time of the murder; Wilson told police he was alone on the beach when Leigh walked past him <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> club, minutes before she was murdered. Webster's statement that he only penetrated Leigh with his finger has been considered by various sources to be inconsistent with the autopsy findings of genital trauma, and the trauma is also inconsistent with NC1's account that his sex with her was consensual. In reviewing the autopsy, Boettcher said that the numerous blows which killed Leigh came from multiple directions, and were probably inflicted with different items, indicating the possibility of more than one perpetrator.|$|E

2500|$|Cintrón walked calmly {{away from}} the bull and was arrested <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> ring, for violating the law banning women from {{fighting}} on foot.

2500|$|On February 15, 2006, Schaefer made suggestive {{comments}} to Elizabeth Krum, a 24-year-old assistant to then-Governor Robert Ehrlich. Responding to Schaefer's request for tea, Krum set a thermal mug {{in front of}} him. Schaefer watched her walk away, then beckoned for her to return. When she obliged, he told her, [...] "Walk again", staring after her <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> conference room. Schaefer initially refused to apologize, saying, [...] "She's a pretty little girl. She ought to be damn happy that I observed her going out the door. The day I don't look at pretty women is the day I die." [...] (Schaefer long called the women with whom he worked [...] "little girls.")

2500|$|Oswald's co-worker, Charles Givens, {{testified to}} the Commission that he last saw Oswald on the 6th floor of the Texas School Book Depository (TSBD) at {{approximately}} 11:55a.m.—35 minutes before the motorcade entered Dealey Plaza. The Commission report stated that Oswald was not seen again [...] "until after the shooting." [...] However, in an FBI report taken {{the day after the}} assassination, Givens said that the encounter took place at 11:30a.m. and that he later saw Oswald reading a newspaper in the first floor domino room at 11:50a.m. William Shelley, a foreman at the depository, also testified that he saw Oswald making a phone call on the first floor between 11:45 and 11:50a.m. Janitor Eddie Piper also testified that he spoke to Oswald on the first floor at 12:00p.m. Another co-worker, Bonnie Ray Williams, was eating his lunch on the sixth floor of the depository and was there until at least 12:10p.m. He said that during that time, he did not see Oswald, or anyone else, on the sixth floor and thought that he was the only person up there. However, he also said that some boxes in the southeast corner may have prevented him from seeing deep into the [...] "sniper's nest." [...] Carolyn Arnold, the secretary to the Vice President of the TSBD, informed the FBI that <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> building to watch the motorcade, she caught a glimpse of a man whom she believed to be Oswald standing in the first floor hallway of the building just prior to the assassination.|$|E
