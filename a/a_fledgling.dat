5|$|The game {{begins with}} the player character, an unnamed human, being killed and resurrected as <b>a</b> <b>fledgling</b> vampire. For this {{unauthorized}} act, the fledgling and their Sire are brought before the Camarilla. The Sire is executed by order of LaCroix; the fledgling is spared the same fate by {{the intervention of the}} Anarch, Nines Rodriguez, and employed by the prince.|$|E
5|$|Phillip Padgett (John Hawkes), <b>a</b> <b>fledgling</b> author, {{sits at a}} desk, {{suffering}} from writer's block. He eventually retires {{to the bathroom to}} discard a spent cigarette. Without warning or concern, the man suddenly reaches into his chest and removes a bloody heart. Later, he walks down metal stairs into a cluttered basement, and opens the door of an incinerator. Noticing a beating heart amidst the flames, and unfazed by the vision, he nonchalantly tosses in a paper bag.|$|E
5|$|After his discharge, Robinson briefly {{returned}} to his old football club, the Los Angeles Bulldogs. Robinson then accepted an offer from his old friend and pastor Rev. Karl Downs to be the athletic director at Sam Huston College in Austin, then of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. The job included coaching the school's basketball team for the 1944–45 season. As it was <b>a</b> <b>fledgling</b> program, few students tried out for the basketball team, and Robinson even resorted to inserting himself into the lineup for exhibition games. Although his teams were outmatched by opponents, Robinson was respected as a disciplinarian coach, and drew the admiration of, among others, Langston University basketball player Marques Haynes, a future member of the Harlem Globetrotters.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of Toho's 1954 film Godzilla, which {{depicted}} a giant dinosaur attacking Tokyo, many Japanese film studios began to produce similar monster films, including Warning from Space. Along with other films such as Shintōhō's Terrifying Attack of the Flying Saucers and the American Forbidden Planet, Warning from Space became part of <b>a</b> <b>fledgling</b> subgenre of films based around science fiction creatures. The film also used the theme of atomic bombs that was present in many films at the time, but showed how the weapons, which devastated the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a decade earlier, could be put to good use. Still others noted the film used another common theme of cosmic collisions {{in the style of}} earlier films such as the 1931 film End of the World, which depicted a comet {{on a collision course with}} the Earth.|$|E
5|$|All six main {{cast members}} from the pilot {{returned}} for the series; James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale play Adam Williams and Rachel Bradley, a couple in <b>a</b> <b>fledgling</b> relationship; John Thomson and Fay Ripley play Pete and Jenny Gifford, a married couple whose first child is born in the first episode; Robert Bathurst and Hermione Norris play David and Karen Marsden, an upper-middle-class couple who are considering having a second child. Each had mixed feelings about whether {{there would be a}} series commission after the poor reception of the pilot; Ripley did not stop thinking about it, in contrast to Bathurst, who viewed it as just another failed pilot he had done.|$|E
5|$|Hayes, an {{attorney}} in Ohio, was city solicitor of Cincinnati from 1858 to 1861. When the Civil War began, he left <b>a</b> <b>fledgling</b> political career to join the Union Army as an officer. Hayes was wounded five times, most seriously at the Battle of South Mountain. He earned a reputation for bravery in combat and was promoted {{to the rank of}} brevet major general. After the war, he served in the Congress from 1865 to 1867 as a Republican. Hayes left Congress to run for Governor of Ohio and was elected to two consecutive terms, from 1868 to 1872, and then to a third term, from 1876 to 1877.|$|E

5|$|The {{new state}} {{legislature}} had also appointed a five-man committee {{to select a}} city {{to be the new}} state capital. Scott applied to have Petersburg, still <b>a</b> <b>fledgling</b> settlement, designated as the capital. Other localities– including Frankfort, Lexington, Louisville, and Boonesborough– also applied. Frankfort was eventually chosen, as Scott's failure to secure Petersburg's designation as the state capital contributed more than anything else to the settlement's failure to even become a viable city. Scott's son, Charles, Jr., wrote to his brother Daniel that their father was planning to run for Congress in 1792; although Charles, Jr. expressed confidence that his father would be elected, his campaign apparently never materialized or faltered shortly after it began. He was, however, chosen as a presidential elector in 1793.|$|E
5|$|The next arc, Summer, reveals {{events that}} {{occurred}} in the summer of one thousand years before the Dream arc, taking place in the Heian period. Kannabi no mikoto, or Kanna, {{is one of the last}} winged beings in Airs fictional setting and is held as a prisoner in her own castle. Since she bears wings on her back, she is not permitted to leave the castle walls or see her mother, who is in a similar situation elsewhere. With Ryūya, a member of her samurai guard, and Uraha, <b>a</b> <b>fledgling</b> telekinetic, Kanna escapes and traverses feudal Japan to find her mother. However, the rest of the guard and a sect of Buddhist monks follow them. After catching up, they place a curse on Kanna where she must endure constant reincarnation and death whenever she finds love; Misuzu is one such reincarnation.|$|E
5|$|Dan and Gretta {{meet with}} Saul, Dan's {{business}} partner {{and co-founder of}} their record label, {{but he does not}} see the same potential in Gretta and turns her away. Undeterred, Dan proposes that he and Gretta produce their own album together, to be recorded live during the summer at various public locations around New York City. Recruiting a team of talented musicians, including Gretta's best friend Steve, Dan sets out to make an album worthy of being published by his label. During this time, Dan and Gretta bond both personally and professionally, and Gretta takes Dan's teenage daughter Violet, <b>a</b> <b>fledgling</b> guitarist, under her wing and encourages her to play on the album. When the album is finished, Dan and Gretta meet again with Saul, who is very impressed with their collaboration. Gretta demands that Saul give Dan his job back and give her a bigger share in the deal. They leave without reaching an agreement, but Dan feels confident that Saul will eventually sign Gretta to the label.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- In {{the ambient}} {{computing}} future, security {{promises to be}} the foundational design feature that allows pervasive systems to protect personal information privacy. <b>As</b> <b>fledgling</b> pervasive computing systems gain a foothold presence in becoming more flexible and, at the same time, more invisibly interconnected, system users may have to trade privacy and protection to gain full entry into this new information-laden environment. This paper examines the current state-of-the-shelf security components, which predominantly overlay wired and wireless networks that will support next generation pervasive systems with a defense-in-depth approach. Information technology “best practices ” are considered, and privacy concerns within typical networks are discussed. An examination of emerging privacy protecting technologies is presented, and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags and legal concerns are discussed to portray the asymmetry of information flow in pervasive systems that can impact our personal information privacy...|$|R
