40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to design a memory cell in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) that consumes lesser power with reduced delay constraint. In the existing system, the FPGA is based on 10 T Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) cell configuration in which power consumption is relatively high. The proposed work includes a Self controllable Voltage Level (SVL) circuit along with 10 T SRAM cell and <b>asynchronous</b> <b>counters</b> in read circuit memory block instead of shift registers. The stand-by leakage power of 10 T SRAM is reduced by incorporating a newly-developed leakage current reduction circuit called SVL circuit, with minimal overheads in terms of chip area and speed, which retains data in standby mode.

40|$|A robust {{cellular}} counter {{could enable}} synthetic biologists to design complex circuits with diverse behaviors. The existing synthetic-biological counters, {{responsive to the}} beginning of the pulse, are sensitive to the pulse duration. Here we present a pulse detecting circuit that responds only at the falling edge of a pulse-analogous to negative edge triggered electric circuits. As biological events do not follow precise timing, use of such a pulse detector would enable the design of robust <b>asynchronous</b> <b>counters</b> which can count the completion of events. This transcription-based pulse detecting circuit depends on the interaction of two co-expressed lambdoid phage-derived proteins: the first is unstable and inhibits the regulatory activity of the second, stable protein. At the end of the pulse the unstable inhibitor protein disappears from the cell and the second protein triggers the recording of the event completion. Using stochastic simulation we showed that the proposed design can detect the completion of the pulse irrespective to the pulse duration. In our simulation we also showed that fusing the pulse detector with a phage lambda memory element we can construct a counter which can be extended to count larger numbers. The proposed design principle is a new control mechanism for synthetic biology which can be integrated in different circuits for identifying the completion of an event...|$|R

The theoretical part describes the components that are used in the work, the description of their functionality and usability. For switching between microcontrollers we have a choice of two options. The first option is monitoring of the signal "reset", which is a simpler variant of SPI, or decoding the Atmel instructions.

40|$|Reversible {{computing}} {{has attracted}} the attention of researchers due to its low power consumption and less heat dissipation compared to conventional computing. A number of reversible gates have been proposed by different researchers and various combinational circuits based on reversible gates have been developed. However the realization of sequential circuit in reversible logic is still at premature stage. Sequential circuits were not available because of feedback was not allowed in reversible circuit. However allowing feedback in space (not in time), some sequential reversible gates and circuits {{have been reported in the}} literature. In this dissertation, we have addressed the problem from two sides. One side is to propose a low cost reversible gate suitable for sequential building block i. e. T flip-flop and hence designing low cost synchronous and <b>asynchronous</b> <b>counters.</b> Another side is to generate the circuit from its behavioral description described in FSM form. Our propose designs of reversible counters are significantly better in optimization parameters such as gate counts, garbage outputs and constant inputs available in literature. We have also proposed a procedure for obtaining reversible circuit from behavioral description through FSM. A very few attempts have been reported in the literature for the conversion FSM to reversible FSM. Because of non-availability of generated sequential reversible circuit in literature, our results cannot be compared with any other circuits. We expect that the sequential reversible circuits will help in debugging the reversible circuits, handling the ambiguous state of an FSM and generating the original input in reverse direction by reversing the original output.

To mitigate the variability of power provided by the harvesters, this paper presents a novel energy-proportional design approach, in which the computational circuit is driven by input power so that its switching activity {{is a function of}} this power. Such an approach realizes an autonomous power gating, as the circuit starts to compute only when input power has arrived. We present a voltage sensor to exemplify the energy-proportional design principle, and such a sensor can be readily adopted in energy harvesting systems for on-chip dynamic power management. This sensor is driven by the charge from a capacitor that samples the measured input voltage to subsequently power up the <b>asynchronous</b> <b>counter,</b> which performs charge-to-digital conversion. We also present an analytical model that characterizes energy-proportional properties of the proposed voltage sensor.

The side channel re-veals the attacker valuable information about the secret key which ultimately enables the attacker to derive the secret key. There are several counter measures that minimize the side chan-nel information.
