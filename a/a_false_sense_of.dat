5|$|The {{effects of}} the cold winter were {{exacerbated}} by problems in the energy sector which caused coal supplies to become low. The coal and electricity industries had been recently nationalised by Clement Attlee's government and placed {{under the control of}} the Minister of Fuel and Power, Manny Shinwell. Shinwell oversaw efforts to increase production, but there were concerns that the coal supply was inadequate. At the start of the winter the coal stockpiles contained enough coal to last for just four weeks, compared to the usual supplies of ten to twelve weeks which existed before the war. However, Shinwell allowed himself to be lulled into <b>a</b> <b>false</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> security by over-optimistic productivity reports from the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). These reports failed to translate into real production as the government feared to take on the NUM, whose members' absentee rates were 2.5 times those of the pre-war period. The risk of a coal shortage caused the public to buy electric fires to ensure a source of heat for their homes. This, in turn, put a greater strain on the supply of electricity– the monthly demand increase caused by electric fires in 1946 was roughly the same as the annual increase in generating capacity. Shinwell was warned in mid-October that a coal shortage was possible, but gambled on a mild winter to keep consumption low so that he would not have to risk a confrontation with the miners.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{widespread}} growth of shopping and buying on mobile devices, termed mCommerce. With this comes a {{need to understand how}} to best design experiences for mobile shopping. To help address this, we conducted a diary and interview study with mCommerce shoppers who have already adopted the technology and shop on their mobile devices regularly. Our study explores typical mCommerce routines and behaviours along with issues of soft trust, given its long-term concern for eCommerce. Our results describe spontaneous purchasing and routine shopping behaviours where people gravitate to their mobile device even if a computer is nearby. We found that participants faced few trust issues because they had limited access to unknown companies. In addition, app marketplaces and recommendations from friends offered a form of brand protection. These findings suggest that companies can decrease trust issues by tying mCommerce designs to friend networks and known marketplaces.

In the midst of our remediation battle and our MTBE discoveries, we have seen the blossoming of a management strategy for contaminated groundwater known as monitored natural attenuation, or MNA. MNA refers to the reliance on natural attenuation (see definition below) processes {{within the context of a}} controlled and monitored site cleanup Hmm. approach to achieve remedial objectives. A close examination of the application of MNA, however, reveals some potential problem areas involving the misidentification of processes that govern contaminant plume behavior.

5000|$|... • Familiarity Effect-refers to the {{tendency}} of individuals to develop a preference for things {{simply because they are}} familiar. This can leave an individual to identify familiar people as guilty, even if they are not. When we are continuously exposed to the same object or person we begin to develop a positive attraction towards said object or person. Simply their familiarity creates a positive sense when re-exposed to the individual or object. In reality one can know very little about a person but by seeing them over and over again can gain unconscious positive recall for their face. This can create memory errors when individuals are asked to identify a criminal and someone familiar to them is placed in the line up. When a familiar face is in among the individuals that the witness is being asked to study, the witness will find himself or herself gravitating towards the familiar face {{whether or not this is}} who they witnessed committing the crime. This leaves them more likely to ignore the cues that are leading them towards other individuals and concentrate on the familiar face, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>false</b> accusation. The <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> familiarity can play a large role in the identification of criminals but when the familiarity of a criminal is mixed in with the familiarity of other individuals, choosing the right person can become quite difficult.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} results of a research effort conducted to better understand the seismic performance and analysis of pile-supported wharves. Given the limited number of well-documented field case histories, the seismic performance of pile-supported wharves has been poorly quantified, and the analysis methods commonly employed in engineering practice have generally not been validated. Field case histories documenting the seismic performance of pile-supported wharves commonly contain only limited information, such as approximations of wharf and embankment deformations and peak ground surface accelerations. In order to supplement the field data, five centrifuge models were dynamically tested, with each model containing close to 100 instruments monitoring pile bending moments, excess pore pressures, displacements, and accelerations. The combined field and model database was used to develop seismic performance relationships between permanent lateral deformations, maximum and residual bending moments and peak ground surface displacements. Key issues such as the seismic performance of batter piles, the development of large moments at depth, and the need to account for permanent lateral deformations for high levels of shaking, even for very stable geometries, are discussed. The field data and model studies were also used to validate two geotechnical seismic performance analysis methods: 1) the limit-equilibrium based rigid, sliding block (Newmark) method, and 2) an advanced finite-difference effective stress based numerical model (FLAC). Favorable predictions were generally obtained for both methods, yet there was a large variability in the results predicted using the rigid, sliding block method. The numerical model predicted the permanent deformations, pore pressure generation, and accelerations fairly well, however, pile bending moments were poorly predicted. The results of this research clearly highlighted the need for analysis validation studies, and note the uncertainty and variability inherent in the seismic performance of complex structures. The lack of adequate validation may lead to <b>an</b> over-confidence and <b>false</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> security in the results of the seismic analysis methods. This dissertation specifically addresses pile-supported wharves, yet the results presented herein are applicable to other pile-supported structures located near, or on, slopes adjacent to the waterfront, such as: bridge abutments, railroad trestles, and pile-supported buildings near open slopes. Performance and analysis issues common to all of these structures are addressed, such as: liquefiable soils, lateral pile response in horizontal and sloping soils, the lateral behavior of piles in rock fill, and global slope stability, as well as the general observed seismic behavior...|$|R
