5|$|A {{more serious}} fictional {{portrayal}} of McCarthy played <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1959 novel The Manchurian Candidate by Richard Condon. The character of Senator John Iselin, a demagogic anti-communist, is closely modeled on McCarthy, {{even to the}} varying numbers of Communists he asserts are employed by the federal government. He remains a major character in the 1962 film version.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{forms of}} human {{leukocyte}} antigen (HLA)especially B46, DR9, DQB1*0303, A2, Bw22, AW19, B17, and DRW8are more common in TPP. Linkage to particular forms of HLA, which plays <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> immune response, might imply an immune system cause, but it is uncertain whether this directly causes TPP or whether it increases the susceptibility to Graves' disease, a known autoimmune disease.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are an {{important}} natural means of transferring genes between different species, which increases genetic diversity and drives evolution.

Viruses are still one of the largest reservoirs of unexplored genetic diversity on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Between April 1947 and December 1948, when George C. Marshall was Secretary of State, Kennan {{was more}} {{influential}} {{than he was}} at any other period in his career. Marshall valued his strategic sense and had him create and direct what is now named the Policy Planning Staff, the State Department's internal think tank. Kennan became the first Director of Policy Planning. Marshall relied heavily on him to prepare policy recommendations. Kennan played <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> drafting of the Marshall Plan.|$|E
5|$|In the comedic poem Þrymskviða, Thor again plays <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> poem, Thor wakes {{and finds}} that his {{powerful}} hammer, Mjöllnir, is missing. Thor turns to Loki, {{and tells him}} that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen. The two go to the dwelling of the goddess Freyja, and so that he may attempt to find Mjöllnir, Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak. Freyja agrees, and says she would lend it to Thor {{even if it were}} made of silver or gold, and Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling.|$|E

MIT alumnus and faculty member George Ellery Hale played <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and other faculty members have been key founders of Franklin W.

5|$|Though {{the ships}} were poorly armored {{compared}} to foreign designs in general, the ships' underwater protection {{was the greatest}} weakness in the armor scheme. The torpedo bulkhead was placed {{too close to the}} outer hull, which reduced its ability to absorb damage. This weakness played <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> loss of both España to grounding in 1923 and the sinking of Alfonso XIII by a single mine in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Australians played <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> New Guinea {{campaign}} during 1942 and 1943. After {{an attempt}} to land troops at Port Moresby was defeated in the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Japanese attempted to capture the strategically important town by advancing overland across the Owen Stanley Ranges and Milne Bay. Australian Army units defeated these offensives in the Kokoda Track campaign and Battle of Milne Bay {{with the support of}} the RAAF and USAAF. Australian and US Army units subsequently assaulted and captured the Japanese bases on the north coast of Papua in the hard-fought Battle of Buna-Gona. The Australian Army also defeated a Japanese attempt to capture the town of Wau in January 1943 and went onto the offensive in the Salamaua-Lae campaign in April. In late 1943, the 7th and 9th Divisions played an important role in Operation Cartwheel, when they landed to the east and west of Lae and secured the Huon Peninsula during the Huon Peninsula campaign and Finisterre Range campaign.|$|E
5|$|Between 1822 and 1848 Bute played <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{creation}} of the Cardiff Docks. The idea was first put forward to Bute {{by one of his}} staff in 1822, who suggested that, with the right investment, Cardiff could be transformed into a major port for exporting coal and iron. The existing seaport, used by the Glamorganshire Canal, was small and inefficient. The new port would then deliver a direct return to Bute from shipping rates, improve the value of his lands in Cardiff itself and increase the value of the royalties he could charge on his coal fields. Initially Bute opposed plans for docks put forward by the local ironmasters, but then changed his mind and pushed forward with his own scheme shortly afterward.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{became the}} leading cabinet {{member in the}} new {{government}} under President Washington. He was a nationalist who emphasized strong central government and successfully argued that the implied powers of the Constitution provided the legal authority to fund the national debt, assume states' debts, and create the government-backed Bank of the United States. These programs were funded primarily by a tariff on imports, and later also by a highly controversial tax on whiskey. To overcome localism, Hamilton mobilized a nationwide network of friends of the government, especially bankers and businessmen, which became the Federalist Party. A major issue {{in the emergence of}} the American two-party system was the Jay Treaty, largely designed by Hamilton in 1794. It established friendly trade relations with Britain, to the chagrin of France and the supporters of the French Revolution. Hamilton played <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Federalist party, which dominated national and state politics until it lost the election of 1800 to Jefferson's Democratic-Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy XII, {{the continents}} in Ivalice are {{presently}} home to three nations: Rozarria, Archadia and Dalmasca. There {{was once the}} Kingdom of Nabradia and the Republic of Landis in Valendia, now either destroyed or assimilated into the Archadian Empire. Strategically located between the rival neighboring empires of Archadia and Rozarria, Dalmasca's position as a neutral buffer region {{between the two countries}} is eliminated when it is invaded by Archadia {{at the onset of the}} game. With the fall of Landis and Nabradia and its reduction to an occupied territory under Archadian rule, Dalmasca is set to play <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> still-heated dispute between its neighbors, which is escalating once more.|$|E
5|$|Located {{near the}} Principality's capital of Andravida {{and the chief}} port of Glarentza, Chlemoutsi played <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Principality's history, but was never {{actually}} besieged. After coming under Byzantine rule in 1427, it was captured in 1460 by the Ottoman Empire, {{along with the rest}} of the Byzantine Despotate of the Morea. In Ottoman times, minor additions were made to provide platforms for artillery, but the castle progressively lost its significance and was completely deserted by the late 18th century. In 1825, during the Greek War of Independence, part of its outer wall was demolished to prevent the Greek rebels from using it. Today it is a preserved monument open to the public.|$|E

5|$|Many pre-Columbian Native American {{societies}} of ancient North America built large pyramidal earth structures known as platform mounds. Among {{the largest and}} best-known of these structures is Monks Mound {{at the site of}} Cahokia in what became Illinois, completed around 1100 AD, which has a base larger than that of the Great Pyramid at Giza. Many of the mounds underwent multiple episodes of mound construction at periodic intervals, some becoming quite large. They are believed to have played <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mound-building peoples' religious life and documented uses include semi-public chief's house platforms, public temple platforms, mortuary platforms, charnel house platforms, earth lodge/town house platforms, residence platforms, square ground and rotunda platforms, and dance platforms.|$|E
5|$|Stories in {{the series}} {{frequently}} emphasize the internal struggles, passions, and tragedies of the characters, and the main plot often recedes into the background as the focus shifts to their personal lives. Games also explore relationships between characters, ranging from love to rivalry. Other recurring situations that drive the plot include amnesia, a hero corrupted by an evil force, mistaken identity, and self-sacrifice. Magical orbs and crystals are recurring in-game items that are frequently connected to the themes of the games' plots. Crystals often play <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> creation of the world, {{and a majority of}} the Final Fantasy games link crystals and orbs to the planet's life force. As such, control over these crystals drives the main conflict. The classical elements are also a recurring theme {{in the series}} related to the heroes, villains, and items. Other common plot and setting themes include the Gaia hypothesis, an apocalypse, and conflicts between advanced technology and nature.|$|E
5|$|The Engineers, {{also known}} as space jockeys, are an ancient race of large humanoids which created {{humanity}} from their own DNA during Earth's primordial era. In Alien, the fossilized corpse of an Engineer is discovered in the pilot's seat of the derelict alien spacecraft; its suit and helmet {{were thought to be}} bones, and is the first victim of the Aliens identified onscreen. The Engineers play <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first prequel, Prometheus, which reveals their biology and intention to infect the human race with an alien contagion and mutagen. In the film, the last surviving Engineer on LV-223 is awakened and immediately tries to resume his mission of delivering the substance to Earth, but he is subsequently stopped by the survivors of the human expedition. The android David 8 pilots an Engineer ship to the species' home world, where he unleashes the mutagen against the population, which kills all the Engineers and all other non-floral life on the planet.|$|E
