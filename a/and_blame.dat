5|$|The New York Times printed two {{versions}} of the raids on its front page, one by David Halberstam implicating Nhu for the attacks, and another with the official government version. Sheehan of United Press International also claimed Nhu was responsible for the attacks, and foreign journalists had to smuggle their stories out by asking people leaving the country at the airport to carry documents for them. At the time, Sheehan and Halberstam were on a Ngô family hit list along with political dissidents because of their exposes of the regime's human rights abuses, and following the raids, they slept at the home of John Mecklin, a U.S. official. They also received information that the Ngos were going to plant bombs in their offices <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> the deaths on the communists.|$|E
5|$|Claude {{then begins}} {{working for the}} city's Yakuza and its leader Asuka Kasen (Lianna Pai), Maria's close friend, who has Claude assassinate Salvatore and get his revenge. This cuts off all of Claude's ties with the Leone family, who are now against him. Claude's work leads him to allying himself with other {{criminal}} sources, such as corrupt police detective Ray Machowski (Robert Loggia), {{an enemy of the}} Cartel. Claude later saves him from Internal Affairs and the CIA by helping him flee to Vice City. Claude also meets charismatic media mogul Donald Love (Kyle MacLachlan), who maintains a huge media front. In an effort to start a war between the Yakuza and Cartel, Claude and Love organise the death of Asuka's brother Kenji Kasen (Les Mau) <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> the Cartel.

Scully {{explains}} Ariel McKesson died of heart failure and then was burned to cover something up. She realizes that all the victims were people who {{came in contact with}} the body of Ariel McKesson: Abbott investigated the crime, her mother identified the body, the undertaker prepared the body, and Myron Stefaniuk pulled the body from the river. All but Myron Stefaniuk are now dead. Doggett and Scully find Myron and ask him about Ernie Stefaniuk, one of the hunters from 1956, who he reveals disappeared a long time ago. The two eventually track down Ernie Stefaniuk, who tells them that he hid on an island {{in the middle of the}} town's lake with his wife, Ariel, for 44 years. Ernie says that the bat creature kills anyone with Ernie’s scent on them, so he had burned his wife’s body to try and cover up the scent. He informs them that it hunts only at night and Myron is in danger. Doggett goes back to find Myron only to be attacked and badly torn up by the creature at the river.|$|E

25|$|Poland's Communist leaders {{intended}} to use the pope's visit to show the people that although the pope was Polish it did not alter their capacity to govern, oppress, and distribute the goods of society. They also hoped that if the pope abided by the rules they set, that the Polish people would see his example and follow them as well. If the pope's visit inspired a riot, the Communist leaders of Poland were prepared to crush the uprising <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> the suffering on the pope.|$|E
25|$|Greig {{played in}} the first World Cup in England in 1975, when his team was {{eliminated}} by Australia in the semi-final. Although suited to the one-day game, Greig never really produced a major performance in the 22 ODIs that he played for England. After the tournament ended, Australia stayed on to play four Ashes Tests. England lost the first match at Edgbaston, <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> fell on the captain Mike Denness, who had just endured a 1–4 defeat in Australia. Denness was sacked and Greig appointed, to high expectation that he would play aggressively and fearlessly in an endeavour to counteract the Australians' strengths.|$|E

25|$|Loose Change 2nd Edition Recut (2006) {{opens with}} a brief {{description}} of past suspicious and questionable motives in the history of American government. This discussion mentions Operation Northwoods, a plan put forward during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 to launch false flag terrorist attacks against the United States <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> them on Cuba as a pretext to invade that country. Focus is particularly directed at the previously proposed plans to substitute real commercial airliners with pilotless drone aircraft in order to investigate the plausibility of covertly using them as weapons whilst maintaining the cover of an accident.|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} of psychopathy {{has been associated}} with organized crime, economic crime and war crimes. Terrorists are sometimes considered psychopathic, and comparisons may be drawn with traits such as antisocial violence, a selfish world view that precludes the welfare of others, a lack of remorse or guilt, <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> externalization. However, John Horgan, author of The Psychology of Terrorism, argues that such comparisons could also then be drawn more widely: for example, to soldiers in wars. Coordinated terrorist activity requires organization, loyalty and ideological fanaticism often to the extreme of sacrificing oneself for an ideological cause. Traits such as a self-centered disposition, unreliability, poor behavioral controls, and unusual behaviors may disadvantage or preclude psychopathic individuals in conducting organized terrorism.|$|E

The man's condition continues to deteriorate as Sarah's fetus develops. The baby is born prematurely and in poor health, and is in need of a blood transfusion. Johnny and Sarah are ultimately nervous not only about the baby's survival chances, but also of the skyrocketing hospital bills that will now need to be paid following the baby's delivery, causing Sarah to have a brief nervous breakdown <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> Johnny for Frankie's death, and tearfully berates him.|$|E

25|$|Unanswered {{questions}} about the tragedy, and questions of cause <b>and</b> <b>blame,</b> have intrigued observers and haunted survivors for over 50 years. The fact that Andrea Doria and Stockholm were speeding in heavy fog (21.8 knots and 18.5 knots, respectively, at the collision) and {{questions about}} their seaworthiness arose at the time. Captain Calamai never assumed another command because the Italian Line feared bad publicity. However, largely because the out-of-court settlement agreement between the two shipping companies ended the fact-finding which was {{taking place in the}} hearings immediately after the disaster, no resolution of the cause(s) was ever formally accomplished. This has led to continued development of information and a search for greater understanding, aided by newer technologies in over half a century since the disaster.|$|E
25|$|According to {{a survey}} by the {{regulatory}} body in 2007, only 30 percent of those connected to the public water network enjoyed continuous water supply. On average, customers received water 12 hours per day. Tap water quality, at least in some areas and at some times, is poor: For example, residents of Cilincing, North Jakarta, have complained that their tap water has been cloudy for two months <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> skin irritation and diarrhoe on the poor water supply. According to interviews with residents in South and West Jakarta, shown in a 2011 video by the Amrta Institute for Water Literacy, service quality has actually deteriorated since the concessions began. One of the reasons is that, because of low pressure, some customers pump directly from the pipes, therefore sucking dirty groundwater through leakages of the pipes.|$|E

25|$|During the week-long clashes that {{occurred}} {{at the beginning of}} May 2008 in Beirut and other regions of the country, the army was unable to prevent rival Lebanese groups from fighting each other. This was because the army, along with the government, had thought {{it would have been better}} if rival groups would eventually end the violence and sort out the dispute between them, alone, other than involving the national army which may have led to great divisions between the soldiers, just like in the civil war. It would have also caused an out cry to the soldiers that could have died, leading to even greater divisions <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> to the political forces. However, whenever ceasefire was brought into action in a specific area or district in Beirut or else where in the country, the LAF would straight away enforce peace. On May 13, the national army had announced that if the clashes would not end as soon as possible, it would have to intervene and use force if necessary to stop them.|$|E
25|$|On the May 28 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Mysterio unsuccessfully fought The Undertaker {{to qualify for}} the World Heavyweight Championship title match at Fatal 4-Way. The Undertaker {{suffered}} a legitimate injury during the match, and a storyline was introduced to explain his absence on television, stating he had been found in a vegetative state by his brother Kane. On June 4 Mysterio won a Battle Royal to earn The Undertaker's place at Fatal 4-Way by last eliminating Kane, and {{went on to win the}} World Heavyweight Championship for the second time. At Money in the Bank, Mysterio defeated Swagger to retain the World title, however, Swagger attacked him after the match. Kane, who had won his Money in the Bank ladder match earlier that night, cashed in for a title shot and quickly defeated Mysterio to win the World Heavyweight Championship. Kane later blamed Mysterio for The Undertaker's fictional injuries. On the July 20 episode of SmackDown, Mysterio defeated Swagger in a two out of three falls match to remain the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship, earning a title match against Kane at SummerSlam. Kane defeated Mysterio at SummerSlam with a seemingly commemorative Tombstone Piledriver, but the Undertaker returned to exonerate Mysterio <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> Kane.|$|E
25|$|This first plotline is {{interspersed}} with scenes of Richard and Susan, who came on vacation to Morocco {{to get away}} from and mend their own woes. The death of their infant third child, to SIDS, has strained their marriage significantly and they struggle to communicate their frustration, guilt, <b>and</b> <b>blame.</b> When Susan is shot on the tour bus, Richard orders the bus driver to the nearest village, Tazarine. There, a local veterinarian sews up Susan's wound to stem the loss of blood. Richard contacts the US embassy to request an ambulance.

25|$|In the U.S, the National Report Card on Adherence rates Americans {{with chronic}} medical {{conditions}} with a grade C+ on adherence to their medication and this contributes {{to an estimated}} cost of $290 Billion annually. Increase in patient medication cost share {{was found to be}} associated with low adherence to medication. The United States is among the countries with the highest prices of prescription drugs which is one of factors leading to the high healthcare costs. This is mainly attributed to the government's lack of ability to negotiate lower prices with monopolies in the pharmaceutical industry especially with the brand name drugs. In order to manage the medication costs, many patients on long term therapies fail to fill their prescription or skip or reduce doses. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation survey in 2015, approximately three quarters (73%) of the public think the drug prices are unreasonable <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> pharmaceutical companies for setting prices so high. In the same report, half of the public reported that they are taking prescription drugs and “quarter (25%) of those currently taking prescription medicine report they or a family member have not filled a prescription in the past 12 months due to cost, and 18 percent report cutting pills in half or skipping doses”. In comparison to Canada, only 8% of adults reported to have skipped their doses or not filling their prescriptions due to the cost of their prescribed medications.|$|E

The origin of this superstition is obscure (there is no record of it before the 1920s) but it is believed to derive from quarry workers: they would see rabbits emerging from their burrows immediately before a rock fall <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> them for increasing the risk of dangerous, sometimes deadly, landslides. If a rabbit was seen in a quarry, the workers would pack up and go home for the day, until the safety of the area had been assured.
