25|$|RFID tags can {{be either}} passive, active or battery-assisted passive. An <b>active</b> <b>tag</b> has an {{on-board}} battery and periodically transmits its ID signal. A battery-assisted passive (BAP) has a small battery on board and is activated when {{in the presence of}} an RFID reader. A passive tag is cheaper and smaller because it has no battery; instead, the tag uses the radio energy transmitted by the reader. However, to operate a passive tag, it must be illuminated with a power level roughly a thousand times stronger than for signal transmission.

30|$|Semi-passive RFID tags {{are very}} similar to passive tags except for the {{addition}} of a small battery (Zhang and Amin 2006). This battery allows the tag IC to be constantly powered (Li et al. 2009). This removes the need for the aerial to be designed to collect power from the incoming signal. Aerials can therefore be optimised for the backscattering signal. Semi-passive RFID tags are faster in response as compared to passive <b>tags.</b> <b>Active</b> RFID <b>tags</b> or beacons, on the other hand, have an internal power source which is used to power any ICs and generate the outgoing signal (Ni et al. 2004; Jin and Lu 2006). They may have longer range and larger memories than the passive tags, as well as the ability to store additional information sent by the transceiver. At present, the smallest <b>active</b> <b>tags</b> are {{about the size of a}} coin. Many <b>active</b> <b>tags</b> have practical ranges of tens of metres, and a battery life of up to 10  years. As passive tags are cheaper to manufacture and have no battery, the majority of RFID tags in existence are of this variety.|$|R

40|$|The Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) {{technology}} has stimulated many innovative applications. Misplaced-tag pinpointing (MTP) {{is important to}} RFID applications in production economics because optimal inventory placement can significantly increase profit. Previous research from the database perspective needs to process {{a large amount of}} data which is time-consuming to collect (and energy-consuming if <b>active</b> <b>tags</b> are used). How to efficiently address the MTP problem from the protocol design perspective however has not been investigated. In this paper, we propose a series of protocols toward efficient MTP solution in large RFID systems. The proposed protocols detect misplaced tags based on reader positions instead of tag positions to guarantee the efficiency and scalability as system scale grows, because the number of readers is much smaller than that of tags. Considering applications to employ more and more popular <b>active</b> <b>tags,</b> we further propose a solution requiring responses from only partial tags in favor of energy saving. We analyze the optimal performances of proposed protocols to demonstrate their efficiency potential and conduct extensive simulation experiments to evaluate their performance under various scenarios.
