5000|$|Lack {{of clear}} {{documentation}} {{has been a}} problem in studying the history of Matthew. Even its name has been questioned, with some authors suggesting that it was actually named Mattea after Cabot's wife. Until the 1950s, all that was known about its size is that it was a small ship carrying about 18 men, but the discovery of a letter from a Bristol merchant named John Day written in 1497 saying that [...] "in his voyage he had only one ship of fifty 'toneles' and twenty men and food for seven or eight months" [...] provided more certainty about its size. The <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> is also uncertain. The name Matthew does not appear in the 1492/3 customs accounts, so it was either fairly new or an older ship renamed or a foreign ship. It has been suggested that it probably was an ordinary Bristol merchant ship hired for the occasion. The name Matthew appears in documents in 1503/04 and 1510/11 but in a 1513 survey there is reference to a 'new Matthew' and references to this ship afterward leave out the 'new' suggesting that Cabot's Matthew no longer existed.|$|E

What the research particularly examined are recommendations (deficiencies), i. e. cases when ships are not allowed to proceed to sea and continue their navigation. The results of the comparative and SWOT analyses are presented, as well as the functional dependence (tendency) of not complying with specific ship components concerning the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> Both the results of the research and the performed analyses show that the majority of recommendations concern the emergency systems, i. e. the safety of navigation and rescue appliances, while the least number of recommendations has been recorded in the training and drills of the crew for emergency situations.

40|$|A set {{of glass}} {{samples from the}} sunken Roman ship Julia Felix, off the town of Grado (Gorizia, Italy) around {{the second half of}} the 2 nd century AD has been studied along with other glass samples from almost coeval levels of archaeological {{excavations}} in the cities of Vicenza (northern Italy) and Pozzuoli (Naples, southern Italy) and in the town of Grado (7 th– 9 th century AD). The glass samples are fairly homogeneous in their chemical composition with typical silicic–sodic–calcic compositions. Superficial lamellar layers of various thickness (from about 200 μm to less than thousand μm) were formed by the glass–water alteration process. The oxygen isotopic composition of the alteration patinae was measured along with that of the apparently unaltered internal section of glass. The oxygen isotopic composition of the Northern Adriatic seawater is known from previous studies along with the mean oxygen isotopic composition of local precipitations at Vicenza, Pozzuoli and Grado. The mean annual temperatures at the sea bottom are also known from previous studies. The knowledge of the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> and of these variables allows the calculation of the diffusion rate of water molecules through the glass and the glass/water fractionation factor at low temperature. The calculated α-values for the ship glasses are very close to one another and consistent among different samples. One of the glass samples from archaeological excavations (Grado) shows an α-value smaller than those calculated for the ship samples. This suggests partial isotope exchange probably related to the reduced exchange time with water (~ 50 %) and, perhaps, to the small amount of water available to this sample. From the results obtained, it is possible to conclude that glass– water oxygen isotope exchange occurs even at relatively low temperatures, isotopic equilibrium being reached in less than 1. 8 ka when large amounts of water are available...|$|E
40|$|With more {{expensive}} bunker {{oil prices and}} much tougher environmental requirements, it is of major importance for shipping companies to reduce their consumption of fuel oil today than it ever has been before. There {{are many ways to}} lower the consumption; the most efficient would be to reduce the speed of the vessel. This study has however focused on the potential savings that could be made by installing an exhaust gas economizer for the auxiliary engine on board ships. The reason why many ships have not installed economizers on their auxiliary engines is because the investment has not been considered necessary before. This work is primarily a case study on the vessel M/V Stena Forecaster, but can probably be seen as a general guideline as well. On-board data from the ship and information from manufacturers has been collected, in order to calculate the steam need for the ship during the period of May 2015, as well as how much steam an exhaust gas economizer could produce during the conditions of May 2015. The exhaust gas economizer in this study would be installed on a Wärtsilä 9 L 20 C engine, and the economizer selected is an Aalborg XS TC 7 A from Alfa Laval. The result shows the possibilities and potential savings of this investment in terms of lower fuel oil consumption for the auxiliary boilers, the environmental benefits with reduced emissions, a possible installation location and a reasonable pay-back time for the current sailing route. This can however differ widely depending on for example sailing routes and weather conditions. An investment of this sort should be discussed having in mind the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> sailing route, and who pays for the bunker oil. In this particular case the owner does not pay for the bunker, the charter does, and therefore the investment cannot be seen as a direct profit for the owner. However, the ship could be more attractive for future charters if the overall fuel oil consumption is lower. A lower fuel oil consumption is also directly beneficial for the environment...|$|E
40|$|For some 140 years {{steel is}} the common {{construction}} material for commercial ships. Together with this, relatively stable, substance a persistent enemy popped up: corrosion. Two long-established methods {{are being used to}} fight this never sleeping enemy: either through the use of coatings, creating a barrier between the electrolyte and the steel or by way of using sacrificial anodes or impressed current, lowering the potential of the steel structure until it becomes cathodic. This article will focus on the correct use of sacrificial anodes in ballast tanks, since these tanks are the most vulnerable to corrosion, especially on board double hull ships due to increased temperatures, inherent wet/dry situations, omnipresence of seawater, storage compartment for ship's structural elements. An in situ survey of > 170 ballast tanks on board merchant ships lead to two principal conclusions: First, epoxy coatings in ballast tanks, remain overall in intact condition for approximately 5 years and afterwards degrade with 1. 7 % surface per year. Secondly, statistical analysis of the database did not show any distinctive advantage of the presence of sacrificial anodes, hence leading to the alarming conclusions that, probably, for many years anodes have been used without any significant impact on corrosion or corrosion rates. We studied this phenomenon further in depth and found that a cathodic protection system will only generate a distinguishable advantage if installed and maintained meticulously. Calculating the total mass of zinc required to lower the potential of the metallic structure sufficiently is rather easy, distributing the anodes correctly throughout the tank to obtain an even and correct potential is already a lot more complicated. Till today, any legal obligation to install sacrificial anodes in ballast tanks, is lacking. Consequently there are no rules promoting a correct weighing and spreading out of the sacrificial anodes. Very often, the design and installation of the cathodic protection system is done by the vendors of the zinc or aluminum anodes. Their and the ship's interest are not always the same. A simulation package, CPMaster, developed by Elsyca, Belgium allows the visualization of the polarization of a metallic structure induced by sacrificial anodes or impressed current. By way of example one of the ballast tanks of the Flanders Harmony, a 28 year old LNG carrier, was modelled and the results were compared with the outcome of a detailed tank inspection held during dry-dock in Bahrain 2013. The resemblance between the in situ observation and the simulation model was satisfying. Although the tank was in a splendid condition, taking into account the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> there was still plenty of room for improvement. The cathodic protection system was oversized and the anodes were not distributed in a uniform way, the sacrificial anodes might even be responsible for the massive quantity of blisters in the tank. Finally we conclude that cathodic protection using sacrificial anodes is a useful technique only if the system is well proportioned, installed, maintained and evolves together with and in function of the condition of the tank. If one is not prepared to follow up the system in a proper way it is better to abandon cathodic protection all together and invest the money gained in an improved coating system...|$|E
