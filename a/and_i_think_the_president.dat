Oh, you DO know. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> violets {{are little}} snips {{of the sky}} that fell down when the angels cut out holes for the stars to shine through. And the {{buttercups}} are made out of old sunshine; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> sweet peas will be butterflies {{when they go to}} heaven. Now, teacher, do you see anything so very queer about those thoughts?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I'm {{so proud}} of Van Dyke Parks' lyrics, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> music is inspiring to listen to." ...|$|R
60|$|Seriously, she beats Van Amburgh. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Duke of Wellington {{must have}} her painted by Landseer.|$|R
60|$|It was the sublimest {{spectacle}} <b>I</b> ever witnessed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{memory of}} it will remain with me always.|$|R
6000|$|... "I understand, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> plan good--for you--and yet, Baas, {{there is}} one thing that I have not told you which may mar it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her voice changed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{last part}} was {{intended}} to have its meaning, but a sudden impulse overcame my reason, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> answered rashly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Suppose we {{take her}} there, then. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{best way to}} do it would be thus, if you don't mind joining hands with me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Jerry, [...] "the Laughing Brook {{has stopped}} laughing, and the Smiling Pool has stopped smiling, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> world is upside down." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was only}} wisdom, for we were nearing Swanston. I rose. [...] "Miss Gilchrist, {{you are a}} good woman; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> cleverest <b>I</b> have met." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{know what}} you <b>think,</b> Dick-- <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> same-- that that man {{was the one who}} aided Crabtree to escape from jail," [...] said Sam.|$|R
60|$|None {{of their}} {{children}} were then above six years old; they were all fruitful enough; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> cook's mate's wife was big of her sixth child.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jack," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "there is Bill Haden {{fighting}} his old bitch Flora against Tom Walker's Jess, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> pup is a-killing the old dorg." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'In great trouble, Dorcas. Captain Wybrow, Sir Christopher's nephew, you know, {{has died}} suddenly. Miss Sarti found him lying dead, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> shock has {{affected}} her mind.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Equal, for and against," [...] he announced. [...] "I have {{a casting}} vote, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{importance}} of the matter justifies my using it. I declare the motion lost." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, faith, betwixt the two," [...] said Mowbray, [...] "I own I {{should have}} {{preferred}} my own name, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> old gentleman's taste rather {{better than the}} young one's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir, thank you; I {{am going}} this moment myself; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> sooner you go the better. I will fetch your {{greatcoat}} {{and open the}} garden door for you." ...|$|R
30|$|People {{come here}} and they do better work, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{environment}} is one piece of it. We call the green carpet “The Green Carpet of Candor.” That helps quite a bit.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} delighted," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "to have {{you make a}} choice for me; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> list would be the better plan, because books would be so heavy to carry about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> see a {{path through}} yonder trees," [...] said Ben, {{pointing}} to his left. [...] "The ground seems to be pretty good there, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> opening is plenty large enough for our cars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I had {{intended}} {{you to go}} to St. Andrews next year, Malcolm, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> best plan will be for you to go there at once. As you say, Duncan can look after the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{your way}} of thinking, is it, Jack. Well, I thank you, old one, for the hint, but have little fear of that craft. We've had our legs together, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> brig has the longest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{a pretty}} color, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> curls much nicer than a boughten switch," [...] said Becky, quite {{unconscious}} {{that her own}} luxuriant locks were of the true Titian red, and would be much admired by artistic eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's true, though I {{hardly know}} him," [...] she {{answered}} with a smile. [...] "One is now and then seized by a quick prejudice, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> reason <b>I</b> mentioned the man was because I wanted your opinion." ...|$|R
30|$|Leah: <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{specialist}} model – {{especially for}} intermediate – because there’s {{so many things}} that teachers have to know really deeply that making change is hard when you’re trying to make change in so many different subject areas.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is a {{stranded}} steamer somewhere up a creek {{behind that}} island, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{men who are}} trying to salve her have a good many difficulties to contend with. Among other things, I fancy the niggers are worrying them." ...|$|R
5000|$|During a June 9, 2009 interview, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., the new {{chairman}} of GM, said, [...] "I don’t know anything about cars ... A business is a business, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can learn about cars. I’m not that old, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> business principles are the same." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "There is {{room for}} the Fed to create a bubble in housing prices, if necessary, to sustain American hedonism. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Fed has the will to do so, even though {{political}} correctness would demand that Mr. Greenspan deny any such thing." ...|$|R
60|$|One of {{the bankers}} subscribed five {{thousand}} dollars, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> other one subscribed half as much, but I {{do not remember}} with certainty now whether that was the figure or not. We got designs made--some of them came from Paris.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll be in inside ten minutes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Madeira boat {{has still}} her anchor down," [...] he said. [...] "I {{had to give}} the {{quartermaster}} orders to have our lancha ready, and he'll take any passengers straight across to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 4. In finance {{some are}} for movement, some {{stationary}} or retrograde {{so as to}} be ready for immediate war. Yet here we are not divided simply as combative or anti-combative. The onward men in finance are: Lord John Russell, Duke of Newcastle, Granville, Argyll, Gibson, W.E.G., <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> chancellor. The stationary men are, first and foremost: Sir George Lewis, Sir C. Wood; next to these, Lord Palmerston, Cardwell, <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> Villiers, Herbert.|$|R
5000|$|Burgess later said, [...] "Strange Times is my favourite. Personally, I {{believe it}} was the best lyrical work I'd done with the band and some of the best vocal performances, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Chameleons really began to mature and move forward with this album".|$|R
5000|$|Vernon Castle {{said of the}} maxixe in his 1914 book Modern Dancing, [...] "The steps {{themselves}} are not difficult; on the contrary, they are childishly simple; it is the easiest dance of all to do, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> hardest of all to do well." ...|$|R
60|$|All day {{the dolls}} went {{about in the}} busy Doctor's pocket, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> violets did them good, for the soft perfume clung to them long {{afterward}} like {{the memory of a}} lovely life, as short and sweet as that of the flowers.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{very hot}} here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Señora Castro {{would find it}} more {{comfortable}} if you brought her a chair outside," [...] she said. [...] "You can leave the door open. It is scarcely likely that I shall run away with your prisoner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Lord bless him," [...] said Uncle Lot, {{as he and}} James were standing, last of all, {{over the}} grave. [...] "I believe my heart is gone to heaven with him; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Lord really did know what was best, after all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sartain--if he obeys his orders; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{young man}} will do that. But the {{business}} {{there will not}} detain him long,"--Mary's countenance brightened again, at this remark,--"and, should you be right, we, may still look {{for him in the}} next ninety days." ...|$|R
