5|$|Teenage pregnancies, {{especially}} <b>among</b> <b>younger</b> teens, are {{at greater}} risk of adverse outcomes including early birth, low birth weight, and death of the infant. In the United States 82% of pregnancies in those between 15 and 19 are unplanned. Comprehensive sex education and access to birth control are effective in decreasing pregnancy rates in this age group.|$|E

A {{breakdown of the}} results shows that support is strongest <b>among</b> <b>younger</b> people and in urban areas. Women were more supportive at 68% compared to 56% of men. There was slightly less support for same-sex couples being given the right to adopt. A total of 58% of those under 50 believe same-sex couples {{should be able to}} adopt, falling to 33% among the over-50s. A total of 54% believe the definition of the family unit in the Irish Constitution should be changed to include same-sex families.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{cartoonist}} Antonucci conceived Ed, Edd n Eddy {{while working}} on a commercial design. Antonucci pitched the series to Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon. Both studios {{were interested in the}} series, but each demanded creative control and Antonucci refused. Cartoon Network ended up commissioning the show after agreeing to let Antonucci have control of the show. After its debut, the series was a success in Nielsen ratings, popular <b>among</b> <b>younger</b> and older viewers. Met with generally positive reviews, the season earned Antonucci a Reuben Award for Best Television Animation.|$|E
30|$|Net of {{educational}} qualifications {{and other factors}} in the model, PISA test scores had only small effects on occupational status, slightly stronger <b>among</b> <b>young</b> men than women. <b>Among</b> <b>young</b> women, a one standard deviation increment in PISA test score increased hourly and weekly earnings by around 5 %, but had no effect <b>among</b> <b>young</b> men. Test scores moderately increased the odds of employment: by about 1.2 times (for a one-standard deviation increase) <b>among</b> <b>young</b> men and 1.3 times <b>among</b> <b>young</b> women. Test scores more strongly reduced the odds of unemployment by about 1.4 times (for a one standard deviation difference). Test scores had no significant effects on full-time employment.|$|R

40|$|Evaluate the {{reliability}} and validity of the Youth Self-Report (YSR) as a screening tool for mental health problems <b>among</b> <b>young</b> people vulnerable to HIV in Ethiopia. A cross-sectional assessment of young people currently receiving social services. Young people age 15 - 18 participated in a study where a translated and adapted version of the YSR was administered by trained nurses, followed by an assessment by Ethiopian psychiatrists. Internal reliability of YSR syndrome scales were assessed using Chronbach's alpha. Test-retest reliability was assessed through repeating the YSR one month later. To assess validity, analysis of the sensitivity and specificity of the YSR compared to the psychiatrist assessment was conducted. Across the eight syndrome scales, the YSR best measured the diagnosis of anxiety/depression and social problems <b>among</b> <b>young</b> women, and attention problems <b>among</b> <b>young</b> men. <b>Among</b> individual YSR syndrome scales, internal reliability ranged from unacceptable (Chronback's alpha = 0. 11, rule-breaking behavior <b>among</b> <b>young</b> women) to good (α≥ 0. 71, anxiety/depression <b>among</b> <b>young</b> women). Anxiety/depression scores of ≥ 8. 5 <b>among</b> <b>young</b> women also had good sensitivity (0. 833) and specificity (0. 754) to predict a true diagnosis. The YSR syndrome scales for social problems <b>among</b> <b>young</b> women and attention problems <b>among</b> <b>young</b> men also had fair consistency and validity measurements. Most YSR scores had significant positive correlations between baseline and post-one month administration. Measures of reliability and validity for most other YSR syndrome scales were fair to poor. The adapted, personally administered, Amharic version of the YSR has sufficient reliability and validity in identifying young vulnerable women with anxiety/depression and/or social problems, and young men with attention problems; which were the most common mental health disorders observed by psychiatrists among the migrant populations in this study. Further assessment of the applicability of the YSR <b>among</b> vulnerable <b>young</b> people for less common disorders in Ethiopia is needed...|$|R
5|$|On March 1 ("Super Tuesday"), Clinton {{won seven}} of eleven contests, {{including}} {{a string of}} dominating victories across the South buoyed, as in South Carolina, by African-American voters and opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders. She maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season, with a consistent pattern throughout being that Sanders did better <b>among</b> <b>younger,</b> whiter, more rural and more liberal voters and in states that held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents, while Clinton did better among older and more diverse voter populations and in states that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered Democrats.|$|E
5|$|Under Neil Kinnock, Labour {{attempted}} to widen its electoral support from narrow class divisions. After Blair took the leadership, the party made significant gains in higher social classes and won 39% support from managers and administrators in the 1997 election, {{more than in}} previous elections that the party had lost. Labour won greater support <b>among</b> <b>younger</b> voters than older, {{but there was no}} significant gender difference. During the 1980s, much of Labour's support had retreated into industrial areas of the north; in 1997, Labour performed much better in the south of England.|$|E
5|$|Though Bengali women {{traditionally}} {{wear the}} sari, the shalwar kameez and Western attire is gaining acceptance <b>among</b> <b>younger</b> women. Western-style dress has greater acceptance among men, although the traditional dhoti and kurta are seen during festivals. Durga Puja, held in September–October, is Kolkata's {{most important and}} largest festival; it is an occasion for glamorous celebrations and artistic decorations. The Bengali New Year, known as Poila Boishak, {{as well as the}} harvest festival of Poush Parbon are among the city's other festivals; also celebrated are Kali Puja, Diwali, Holi, Jagaddhatri Puja, Saraswati Puja, Rathayatra, Janmashtami, Maha Shivratri, Vishwakarma Puja, Lakshmi Puja, Ganesh Chathurthi, Makar Sankranti, Gajan, Kalpataru Day, Bhai Phonta, Maghotsab, Eid, Muharram, Christmas, Buddha Purnima and Mahavir Jayanti.

5|$|Further {{social changes}} {{brought about by}} the {{presence}} of American military personnel were exemplified in the storm's wake. The use of currency as a means for obtaining goods was first seen in Ulithi in 1956, four years before the typhoon. However, despite the total destruction of markets by Ophelia they were quickly rebuilt, depicting the quick entrenchment of currency in native culture. The reconstruction also accelerated a desire for new goods from trading. Store owners requested a wider range of material to have in stock than seen previously. From a societal standpoint, Ophelia prompted great advances in the Ulithian culture. Women, previously limited to agriculture, housework, and eventually shopping, were found to be doing heavy work (i.e. carpentry, chopping, digging, and lifting) in the immediate wake of the typhoon. A shift in government took place as well, with authority of King Malefich waning to greater power <b>among</b> <b>younger</b> individuals. Malefich also displayed great ineptitude during the storm and was subsequently disposed of as King following Ophelia's passage. The changes in authority occurred due to spontaneous leadership during the storm by the younger persons in order to protect others. Prior to the typhoon, younger members of tribes never spoke during council meetings; however, by 1961 they made their presence known in such meetings.|$|E
