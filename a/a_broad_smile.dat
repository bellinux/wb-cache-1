500|$|The Tramp happens by the shop, {{where the}} girl is {{arranging}} flowers in the window. He stoops to retrieve a blossom discarded in the gutter. After a brief skirmish with his old nemeses, the newsboys, {{he turns to the}} shop's window where he suddenly sees the girl, who has been watching him without (of course) knowing who he is. At the sight of her he is frozen for a few seconds, then breaks into <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>smile.</b> The girl is flattered and giggles to her employee: [...] "I've made a conquest!" [...] Via pantomime through the glass, she kindly offers him a fresh flower (to replace the crushed one he took from the gutter) and a coin.|$|E
500|$|Greeley {{attended}} the convention {{as a substitute}} for a delegate from Oregon who was unable to attend. In Chicago, he promoted Bates but deemed his cause hopeless and felt that Seward would be nominated. In conversations with other delegates, he predicted that, if nominated, Seward could not carry crucial battleground states such as Pennsylvania. Greeley's estrangement from Seward was not widely known, giving the editor more credibility. Greeley (and Seward) biographer Glyndon G. Van Deusen noted that it is uncertain how great a part Greeley played in Seward's defeat by Lincoln—he had little success gaining delegates for Bates. [...] On the first two ballots, Seward led Lincoln, but on the second only by a small margin. [...] After the third ballot, on which Lincoln was nominated, Greeley was seen among the Oregon delegation, <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>smile</b> on his face. According to Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, [...] "it is hard to imagine Lincoln letting Greeley's resentment smolder for years as Seward did".|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Prendergast {{had hardly}} descended to the drawing-room before her husband's voice called {{her to the}} study, where he stood, his broad mouth {{distended}} by <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> <b>smile,</b> his eyes twinkling with merriment.|$|R
2500|$|The Chan {{tradition}} ascribes {{the origins}} of Chan in India to the Flower Sermon, the earliest source for which comes from the 14th century. It is said that Gautama Buddha gathered his disciples one day for a Dharma talk. When they gathered together, the Buddha was completely silent and some speculated that perhaps the Buddha was tired or ill. The Buddha silently held up and twirled a flower and his eyes twinkled; several of his disciples tried to interpret what this meant, though {{none of them were}} correct. One of the Buddha's disciples, Mahākāśyapa, silently gazed at the flower and broke into <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>smile.</b> The Buddha then acknowledged Mahākāśyapa's insight by saying the following: ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Chicago game, 1,000 {{students}} {{gathered at}} the Athens Theater in Ann Arbor where they listened to a play-by-play account of the game as it was transmitted by telegraph from Chicago. [...] Michigan gains were met with cheering. [...] When Widman's touchdown run was announced, [...] "It {{seemed as if the}} whole assembly was thrown into the air by a volcanic eruption. Men threw their hats and coats at one another and hugged and danced in the aisles for fully ten minutes." [...] After the game, the crowd marched through the streets to President James B. Angell's home. [...] President Angell greeted the crowd with <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>smile</b> and said, [...] "I congratulate you on the success of the Michigan team in Chicago this afternoon. [...] It is a great victory, and we owe much to the men who have won the laurels of our victory from the brow of our sister institution of learning. [...] It has been said that I am opposed to the game, but I wish to say that I, too, used to play in college. [...] In those days, however, we played the Herschberger game, and used to kick the ball instead of the man. [...] It is a great termination of the fall campaign, and we are greatly indebted to those who have so actively participated in it." ...|$|E

6000|$|His wizened face {{broke into}} <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> <b>smile,</b> {{and the three}} young ladies laughed in musical echo to his pleasantry, swaying their bodies to and fro, with nervous jerks of their shoulders. The boldest said: ...|$|R
6000|$|Master Trench's mouth {{expanded}} into <b>a</b> very <b>broad</b> <b>smile</b> {{as he looked}} round the group of men. [...] "D'ye hear that, lads, what Master Swinton thinks {{ought to be done}} to thieves?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I told you," [...] {{said the}} youth, with <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> <b>smile,</b> [...] "that I didn't have but three cents. Besides, if I had a thousand, we'd {{have to wait}} here until morning. You can {{understand}} that, of course. I'm much obliged, but I can't take any of your money. Miss Bedford and I have lived an outdoor life, and we don't mind a little cold. I'll get work of some kind to-morrow. We've got a paper bag of cakes and chocolates, and we'll get along all right." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{form of the}} Tió de Nadal {{found in}} many Aragonese and Catalan homes {{during the holiday season}} is a hollow log about thirty {{centimetres}} long. Recently, the Tió has come to stand up on two or four stick legs with <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>smiling</b> face painted on its higher end, enhanced by a little red sock hat (a miniature of the traditional barretina) and often a three-dimensional nose. Those accessories have been added only in recent times, altering the more traditional and rough natural appearance of a dead piece of wood.|$|R

6000|$|... 'It is {{the best}} idea,' said Mr. Pickwick to himself, smiling till he almost cracked the nightcap strings--'it {{is the best}} idea, my losing myself in this place, and {{wandering}} about these staircases, that I ever heard of. Droll, droll, very droll.' Here Mr. Pickwick <b>smiled</b> again, <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> <b>smile</b> than before, {{and was about to}} continue the process of undressing, in the best possible humour, when he was suddenly stopped by a most unexpected interruption: to wit, the entrance into the room of some person with a candle, who, after locking the door, advanced to the dressing-table, and set down the light upon it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, by the week, of course," [...] Philip answered, suppressing <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>smile</b> of {{absolute}} {{surprise at the}} man's childish ignorance.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} looked up. His face flashed into <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "Hello! Brad Talcott, by thunder! Well, well. When'd you get back?" ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{man was not}} a movie bandit. He wore a green {{imitation}} of a Norfolk jacket, he had <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> red <b>smile,</b> and as he flourished his hat in a bow, his hair was a bristly pompadour of gray-streaked red that was almost pink. He made oration: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, then," [...] said Lee, with <b>a</b> <b>broad,</b> gratified <b>smile,</b> {{laying down}} his whip and pistol within reach, and comfortably {{settling}} the pillows behind his back, [...] "we'll have a quiet confab. A sort of old-fashioned talk, eh? You're not looking well, Manuel. You're {{drinking too much}} again. It spoils your complexion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I thought Violet {{would sleep}} {{better for the}} last news,' said he, {{kneeling}} on one knee {{to look at the}} child, his face so softened and thoughtful that it was hardly like the same; but recovering, he gave <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> careless <b>smile,</b> together with a sigh: 'Little monkey,' he said, 'he gets hold of one somehow--I wish he may have got through it. Theodora, I hope you will have no alarms. Violet will take it very kind of you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please, ma'am," [...] {{said the}} {{domestic}} with <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>smile,</b> {{as she took}} the basket of vegetables, [...] "would you like a cup of tea?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{you for the}} information," [...] said Sam, {{and passed}} over a quarter, which Rater {{pocketed}} with <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>smile.</b> Ready money was scarce with him.|$|E

6000|$|At {{the close}} of the address I ventured to the {{platform}} and expressed to him my interest in what he had said. He was a large man with <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> and <b>smiling</b> face, framed in a brown beard. He appeared pleased with my compliments and asked if I were a resident of Boston. [...] "No, I am a western man," [...] I replied. [...] "I am here to study and I was especially interested in your quotations from Darwin's book on Expression in Man and Animals." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{paradigm}} shift from occlusion to esthetics emphasizes {{the interplay between}} dental structures and the surrounding soft tissue envelope. The objective {{of this study was}} to quantify the ideal and maximum acceptable deviation for nine smile characteristics by using digital manipulation of hard and soft tissue smile components. Intraoral photographs were manipulated using Adobe ® Photoshop ® CS 2 to alter buccal corridor, smile arc, gingival display, crown torque in maxillary canines and the posterior buccal segments. Smiles were placed in a gender neutral face showing nasal tip to mentolabial fold. Quask ™ Form Artist was used to generate the survey, which was administered in Columbus, OH (n= 43); Seattle, WA (n= 41) and Boston, MA (n= 40). An interactive interface allowed raters to move a slider to answer questions. Rater reliability was assessed for each variable. We found that, in general, raters were reliable (K = 0. 5 - 0. 8). Survey location was not significant except for the finding that the West coast accepted <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> <b>smile</b> (1. 5 mm buccal corridor) than the Midwest and East coasts where the buccal corridor wa...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{functional}} jaw orthopedics, at the correct time during growth, can ultimately result in malocclusion patients achieving <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> beautiful <b>smile,</b> <b>an</b> excellent functional occlusion, a full {{face with a}} beautiful jaw line and lateral profile. Following is a case report of a young growing individual with mandibular retrognathia. Treatment was planned in two stages {{with the use of}} twin block during the first phase for correction of skeletal malocclusion and forward positioning of the mandible, followed by the second phase of fixed pre-adjusted edgewise orthodontic appliance for camouflaging the remaining skeletal discrepancy and achieving a stable harmonious occlusion...|$|R

6000|$|It {{has been}} urged that the {{criticism}} I have passed on {{things as they}} are in England is too pessimistic. I must say, in extenuation, that of optimists I am the most optimistic. But I measure manhood less by political aggregations than by individuals. Society grows, while political machines rack to pieces and become [...] "scrap." [...] For the English, so far as manhood and womanhood and health and happiness go, I see <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> and <b>smiling</b> future. But for {{a great deal of the}} political machinery, which at present mismanages for them, I see nothing else than the scrap heap.|$|R
60|$|She {{was evidently}} very happy, and her {{happiness}} {{gave her an}} air of innocence. The talk of her friend, whoever he was, abundantly suited her humour, for she sat listening to him with <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> idle <b>smile</b> and interrupting him fitfully, while she crunched her bonbons, with a murmured response, presumably as broad, which appeared to {{have the effect of}} launching him again. She drank a great deal of champagne and ate an immense number of strawberries, and was plainly altogether a person with an impartial relish for strawberries, champagne and what she doubtless would have called betises.|$|R
40|$|Jeffrey Rockwell {{came to the}} Yale Law School in 1971, of an {{age with}} his classmates, {{but in many ways}} already a whole man. Jeff was a study of modesty and self-control. He had been born in New England but {{migrated}} with his family to Kansas, where he grew up. He had the style of the Connecticut Yankee, but enjoyed blending it with a certain midwestern understatement and dry humor. His composure, self-control and essentially sober, deeply dedicated approach to life were communicated clearly. Yet even in serious debate his eyes were quick with humor. A telling point would often be followed by <b>a</b> <b>broad,</b> warm <b>smile...</b>|$|R
