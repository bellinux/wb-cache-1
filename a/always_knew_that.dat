5|$|However, as {{the fifth}} season's {{production}} period entered its final months, rumors began to circulate – {{especially among the}} production crew members in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada – {{about the future of}} the series, particularly concerning whether the show would be moving to Los Angeles, California for the sixth season and whether the new recurring character of Jeffrey Spender was planned (in case David Duchovny cut back his commitment to the series) to become a replacement for Duchovny's character of Fox Mulder – either as a part-time or full-fledged substitute. Other, contradictory rumors that Owens heard were that either he or Duchovny would appear in only eight episodes of the sixth season and that his casting as Spender was a sign that the series would either be leaving Vancouver or staying there. According to the actor himself, he <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Duchovny would not be leaving the series but only discovered that The X-Files would indeed be moving to Los Angeles when the official announcement was made.|$|E
5|$|Tess, {{awakening}} {{on a table}} {{inside a}} laboratory, is greeted by the parallel universe version of Lionel Luthor (John Glover), who reveals that Lex took his imperfect clones' best pieces and assembled them to create a perfect clone of himself. Lionel attempts to use Tess's heart to bring Lex back to life, but she breaks free and shoots Lionel during her escape. Lionel makes a deal with Darkseid to bring his son to life in exchange for Lionel's soul. Clark tracks Tess to the Luthor Mansion, where he is confronted by Lex. Clark apologizes {{for not being able}} to save Lex, but declares that he will always be there to stop him in the future. Oliver confronts Granny Goodness, Desaad, and Gordon Godfrey, dispatching them with three arrows. At LuthorCorp, Tess confronts Lex, who reveals that he <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> she was his sister and that he used her. Lex embraces Tess, and stabs her in the stomach as he tells her he loves her, claiming to be saving her from becoming like him. As she lays dying, she infects Lex with a neurotoxin that erases all of his memories within 30 seconds.|$|E

There, he forswore politics for a while, busying himself mainly with economic issues, papal social encyclicals, and Catholic Action.

25|$|The Treehouse Village: The {{people of}} this village believe that strange occurrences will befall them if they don't live high in tree tops. This is {{also a part of}} the green belt that runs through the fairy world. It is all part of Aeval’s plant network. Though others may doubt it, Aeval <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the trees saw and remembered everything. Over time they have been used to hide treasures and secrets. In The Book of Air, someone within the fairy world has turned the trees to gold, keeping them from “speaking” with Aeval. The trees are being used to protect a key – the very key the Clockmaker needs to fix his Time Synchronization Machine. Lyra must help the trees in order for the trees to help Lyra.|$|E

He stated, [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the fans were behind me, even through the tough times.

500|$|In October 2011, Tricky Stewart told MTV that he {{was back}} in the studio with Perry working on {{leftovers}} from their Teenage Dream sessions. He stated: [...] "Katy and I went into [...] just to address some issues with [...] records that we had done in the past that didn't end up going on , so {{we are in the process}} of just listening and freshening up things and getting ready for something special she has going on", hinting that Teenage Dream would have a re-release. Stewart also added: [...] "We <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the records we created were special [...] at the time it was more contractual obligation , I can only have so many songs produced by me on the album, and she honestly didn't need any more records, as you can tell by the success of this album, the songs have been flawless." [...] The producer later revealed one of the songs was titled [...] "Dressing Up", saying: [...] "This song is really special. It's called 'Dressing Up,' so it's going to be a big record, I think, it definitely fits. It's right there in what her sensibilities are as a musician and a songwriter. She doesn't change much. She has a very keen musical taste. It'll be really good".|$|E
500|$|The band {{released}} Deja Entendu through Razor & Tie/Triple Crown Records in June 2003, being {{issued in}} Europe and Australia in October 2003. The album's title, Deja Entendu, is French for [...] "already heard." [...] It was explained as [...] "very tongue-in-cheek" [...] by vocalist Jesse Lacey. Elaborating on the title's meaning, he told MTV, [...] "No {{matter who you}} are or what your band is about, you can't put a record out without people saying it's derivative of something else. So by saying the record's already been heard, it's kind of like saying, 'Yeah, you're right. We're doing something that's already been done before.'" [...] He reinforced, [...] "We're not trying to break new ground in music. We're {{just trying to make}} good music." [...] The album was described as a [...] "stylistic leap" [...] from Your Favorite Weapon, with a [...] "decidedly matured" [...] sound. In an interview with Billboard, Lacey said that although Deja Entendu does offer a different sound, the album [...] "doesn't seem like we're departing from anything, really. I think we <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{we had a lot of}} potential and there's a lot of different stuff we were able to do, and a lot of different sounds we wanted to make. Not too long after we recorded the first record, we were already wondering where we were going to go from there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Initially Davies and {{director}} Giacomo Campiotti clashed {{about how to}} present the material. Davies recalled, [...] "The first couple of weeks after Giacomo joined this project were horrendous for me because Zhivago {{has always been one}} of his very favorite books. He has always dreamed about filming it and has his own interpretation in his head. I can actually remember thinking after one long, long day, where we just didn't agree about a single thing, that it wasn't going to work—it's either got to be him or me. Somehow, we arrived at a compromise and I have almost forgotten what we were arguing about now, as now we are both very pleased with the script. I <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> he would make it look beautiful because he has got a poet's vision and now, having seen the rushes and some cut footage, I feel like he is my favourite director of all time. Everything is delightful now... Giacomo Campiotti's direction makes it extraordinary." ...|$|E
2500|$|Closing track, [...] "Tomorrow's Food", was {{the first}} song written for the album. Einziger stated that the song was {{conceived}} in 2009 with Lee Hartney from The Smith Street Band and [...] "was written {{at a time when}} I didn’t know whether or not {{we were going to go}} back and start working on new music for a new album. I’d been off at Harvard for a while and Brandon was really focusing on painting and for a little while there we didn’t have all that much communication. I just sort of wrote that guitar part, the chord progression and the changes and stuff and Brandon just sort of responded to it. We kind of just put it aside and then when we started working on new music for this album, I think we <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> we wanted to record it in the studio and make it really great. But that actually was one of the last things that we did for this album." ...|$|E
2500|$|Guyana made 346 {{after being}} put in to bat at Guaracara Park, with West Indies player Ramnaresh Sarwan top-scoring with 122, but Trinidad and Tobago responded with a 159-run third wicket stand between Brian Lara and Daren Ganga. Esuan Crandon took three wickets, of Ganga, Dwayne Bravo and Sherwin Ganga, and Trinidad and Tobago were 215 for 5, needing a further 132 to gain a first innings lead. Lara {{continued}}, however, and after 270 minutes he brought up his fifth hundred at this ground. He continued to make 153, which left Trinidad and Tobago close at 332 for 8 when he was caught by Shivnarine Chanderpaul off the bowling of Crandon; Rayad Emrit took them into the lead with a half-century, and the hosts closed on 398. The last day saw some rain, and Guyana eventually closed on 159 for 3; Trinidad and Tobago captain Daren Ganga said afterwards that [...] "We <b>always</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> this game was a first innings affair and we achieved the result we wanted.".
