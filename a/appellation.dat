The Neumann family thus acquired the hereditary <b>appellation</b> Margittai, meaning of Marghita. The family had no connection with the town; the <b>appellation</b> was chosen in reference to Margaret, as was those chosen coat of arms depicting three marguerites. Neumann János became Margittai Neumann János (John Neumann of Marghita), which he later changed to the German Johann von Neumann.|$|E
5|$|While totally {{dominating}} the region's production, sparkling Champagne {{is not the}} only product that is made from the region's grapes. Non-sparkling still wines, like those made around the village Bouzy, are sold under the <b>appellation</b> label Coteaux Champenois. There is also a rosé <b>appellation</b> in the region, Rosé des Riceys. The regional vin de liqueur is called Ratafia de Champagne. Since the profit of making sparkling Champagne from the region's grape is now much higher, production of these non-sparkling wines and fortified wines is very small.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as his}} {{two sons}} Ælfhelm left a daughter, Ælfgifu of Northampton, by a woman named Wulfrun; Ælfgifu's {{territorial}} <b>appellation</b> is taken as further evidence that Ælfhelm had territory in the eastern Danelaw. She is perhaps more famous than her father, because at some time between 1013 and 1016 she married Cnut, son of Sweyn Forkbeard, future King of the English. Her son was Harold Harefoot, King of the English.|$|E

Considering that the {{protection of}} <b>appellations</b> of geographical origin in Serbia is mainly related to agricultural and food products, {{and the fact that we}} have 52 domestic and only 3 internationally protected <b>appellations</b> of origin, these could be used as a powerful tool to support the growth of competitiveness in agriculture of certain regions as well as of the entire country. <b>Appellations</b> of geographical origin have a collective ownership and represent a kind of national resource...|$|R
5|$|In 1942, the Comité Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne (CIVC) {{was formed}} {{with the purpose}} of {{protecting}} Champagne's reputation and marketing forces as well as setting up and monitoring regulations for vineyard production and vinification methods.

5|$|As the 19th century wore on, workhouses {{increasingly}} became refuges for the elderly, infirm {{and sick}} {{rather than the}} able-bodied poor, and in 1929 legislation was passed to allow local authorities to take over workhouse infirmaries as municipal hospitals. Although workhouses were formally abolished by the same legislation in 1930, many continued under their new <b>appellation</b> of Public Assistance Institutions {{under the control of}} local authorities. It was not until the National Assistance Act of 1948 that the last vestiges of the Poor Law disappeared, and with them the workhouses.|$|E

50|$|The TTB defines AVAs at {{the request}} of wineries and other petitioners. As of November 2016, there were 238 AVAs in the United States. Prior to the AVA system, wine <b>appellations</b> of origin in the United States were {{designated}} based on state or county boundaries.

5|$|The five {{best known}} appellations in the Languedoc include Languedoc AOC (formerly {{known as the}} Coteaux du Languedoc), Corbières AOC, Faugères, Minervois AOC, and Saint-Chinian AOCs. The vast {{majority}} of Languedoc wines are produced by wine cooperatives which number more than 500. However, the <b>appellation</b> system {{in the region is}} undergoing considerable changes with both new appellations being created and existing ones changing. One recent change is that the Coteaux du Languedoc has changed name to Languedoc and been extended to include also the Roussillon.|$|E
5|$|Authors {{have speculated}} {{on a range}} of {{buildings}} that could account for the Tower <b>appellation.</b> Malkin Tower may have incorporated a Norman peel tower, built as a defence against Scottish raiders or might have been a disused poacher's lookout, but {{it is more likely that}} despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage. Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation. Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel, and tower may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents. It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Gasparo Cairano before 1489. No {{information}} has been found about the date and place of his birth, education, or the circumstances {{that led him to}} Brescia. The <b>appellation</b> da Milano, with which he is often recalled in the sources, however, does not provide a definitive fact of his origin because it could refer to the city {{as well as to the}} dukedom or diocese. The generic reference, in any case, is compatible with the cultural basis of his artistic work. Some conjectures can be made on the surname Cairano, in particular that it leads one to Cairate in Varese province, which is to this day shortened to Caira in the local dialect.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "Beaune" [...] {{also appears}} in the <b>appellations</b> Chorey-lès-Beaune AOC and Savigny-lès-Beaune AOC. However, these are {{separate}} <b>appellations</b> from two other communes that border on Beaune, and the lès-Beaune in these villages' names simply mean [...] "near Beaune".|$|R
50|$|After World War II the {{committee}} became the public-private Institut National des <b>Appellations</b> d'Origine (INAO).In 1990, the economic {{success of the}} <b>appellations</b> led parliament in a law of July 2 to extend {{the powers of the}} INAO to cover all agricultural produce.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are also}} some other French <b>appellations</b> for {{sparkling}} wines, which do not carry the name Crémant. Some of these are exclusively sparkling wine <b>appellations,</b> and some are <b>appellations</b> allowing both still and sparkling wine to be made. The term Mousseux is French for [...] "sparkling" [...] and can refer to a sparkling wine made using methods other than the méthode champenoise such as the Charmat method, while Crémant can only be used for wines {{that have been made}} using the méthode champenoise.|$|R
5|$|The {{boundary}} of the eastern Languedoc with the Southern Rhône Valley wine region was moved slightly in 2004, {{with the result that}} Costières de Nîmes AOC is now a Rhône <b>appellation</b> rather than a Languedoc one. In that year, INAO moved the responsibility for oversight of this appellation's wine to the regional committee of the Rhône valley. Local producers of Côtes du Rhône-styled wines made from Syrah and Grenache lobbied for this change since the local winemaking traditions did not coincide with administrative borders, and presumably due to the greater prestige of Rhône wines in the marketplace. Such changes of borders between wine regions are very rare, so out of habit, Costières de Nîmes remains listed as a Languedoc wine in many publications.|$|E
5|$|The {{speech was}} a success and Ingersoll’s <b>appellation</b> of “plumed knight” {{remained}} a nickname for Blaine for years to come. On the first ballot, no candidate received the required majority of 378, but Blaine had the most votes, with 285 and no other candidate had more than 125. There were a few vote shifts {{in the next five}} ballots, and Blaine climbed to 308 votes, with his nearest competitor at just 111. On the seventh ballot the situation shifted drastically as anti-Blaine delegates began to coalesce around Hayes; by the time the balloting ended, Blaine’s votes had risen to 351, but Hayes surpassed him at 384, a majority.|$|E
5|$|The Gardens are {{believed}} to have opened just before the Restoration of 1660, on property formerly owned by Jane Fauxe, or Vaux, widow, in 1615. Whereas John Nichols in his History of Lambeth Parish conjectures that she was the widow of Guy Fawkes, executed in 1606, John Timbs in his 1867 Curiosities of London states for a fact that there was no such connection, and that the Vaux name derives from one Falkes de Breauté, a mercenary working for King John who acquired the land by marriage. Jane is stated to be the widow of John, a vintner. Perhaps the earliest record is Samuel Pepys' description of a visit he made to the New Spring Gardens on 29 May 1662. The then name distinguished the gardens from the Old Spring Gardens at Charing Cross; however Pepys implies that there were both Old and New Spring Gardens at Vauxhall; and indeed Spring Gardens {{appears to have been a}} longstanding <b>appellation</b> for a variety of entertainment enterprises.|$|E

50|$|The entire Rhône region {{produces}} around 4 million hl of wine each year, {{of which}} over half is classified under the Côte du Rhône and Côte du Rhône-Villages <b>appellations.</b> The prestigious Northern Rhône <b>appellations</b> account {{for less than}} 5% of the total Rhône wine production.|$|R
2500|$|Despite (or {{perhaps because}} of) the {{traditional}} importance of <b>appellations</b> for wine, {{there has been}} little harmonisation of national provisions within the European Union. Member States delimit the specified areas of production and determine the rules and <b>appellations</b> which apply: the European Commission restricts itself to publishing the information provided by the Member States. <b>Appellations</b> are usually the geographical name of the area in which the wine is produced, although there are some historical exceptions: muscadet and blanquette in France, cava and manzanilla in Spain and vinho verde in Portugal. The <b>appellations</b> are not necessarily unique: Cava may refer either to a quality sparkling wine psr produced in Spain or to a Greek table wine which has been aged (as a transliteration of [...] "Κάβα").|$|R
5|$|The {{constellation}} {{was known}} by other names. It was called Tubus Astronomicus {{in the eighteenth}} century, during which time three constellations depicting telescopes were recognised—Tubus Herschelii Major between Gemini and Auriga and Tubus Herschelii Minor between Taurus and Orion, both of which {{had fallen out of}} use by the nineteenth century. Johann Bode called it the Astronomische Fernrohr in his 1805 Gestirne and kept its size, but later astronomers Francis Baily and Benjamin Gould subsequently shrank its boundaries. The much-reduced constellation lost several brighter stars to neighbouring constellations: Beta Telescopii became Eta Sagittarii, which it had been before Lacaille placed it in Telescopium, Gamma was placed in Scorpius and renamed G Scorpii by Gould, Theta Telescopii reverted to its old <b>appellation</b> of d Ophiuchi, and Sigma Telescopii was placed in Corona Australis. Initially uncatalogued, the latter is now known as HR 6875. The original object Lacaille had named Eta Telescopii—the open cluster Messier 7—was in what is now Scorpius, and Gould used the Bayer designation for a magnitude 5 star, which he felt warranted a letter.|$|E
5|$|Under <b>appellation</b> rules, around 4,000 {{kilograms}} (8,800 pounds) {{of grapes}} can be pressed to create up to 673 gallons (either 2,550 L or 3,060 L) of juice. The first 541 gallons (either 2,050 L or 2,460 L) are the cuvée {{and the next}} 132 gallons (either 500 L or 600 L) are the taille. Prior to 1992, a second taille of 44 gallons (either 167 L or 200 L) was previously allowed. For vintage Champagne, 100% of the grapes must come from that vintage year while non-vintage wine {{is a blend of}} vintages. Vintage champagne must spend a minimum of three years of aging. There are no regulations about how long it must spend on its lees, but some of the premier Champagne houses keep their wines on lees for upwards of five to ten years. Non-vintage Champagne must spend a minimum of 15 months of aging but only a minimum of 12 months on the lees. Most of the Champagne houses keep their wines on the lees through the whole time of aging because it is more expense to bottle the wine then age it and finally shipped.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Strez and Boril {{had come to}} peace with Michael I Komnenos Doukas, the ruler of Epirus. In late 1209, Strez and Michael may have {{attempted}} a joint campaign against Thessaloniki, as they both lost lands to the Latins in what was likely a retaliation raid in late 1209 or early 1210. The failure of this attack prompted Michael {{to break away from}} his Bulgarian allies and support the Latins. In early 1211, Strez clashed with the Latins and Epirotes at Thessaloniki and required Boril's assistance after Michael and Henry invaded the western reaches of Strez's realm. In the early summer, the allied Bulgarian army suffered a heavy defeat at Bitola at the hands of Michael, Henry's brother Eustace and Bernard of Katzenellenbogen. Even though it resulted in no territorial losses, it prevented Strez from an expansion to the south. In relation to an anti-Bogomil council in 1211, Strez is referred to as a sebastokrator. The title was either conferred to him by Boril as part of their agreement in 1209, or was awarded to Strez by Kaloyan during his rule. In any case, Boril certainly recognized Strez's right to that <b>appellation.</b> There are signs that Strez divided his possessions into administrative units, each headed by a sebastos. In 1212, Strez was powerful enough to be considered one of the Latin Empire's chief adversaries, along with Boril, Michael and Nicaean emperor Theodore I Laskaris, by Henry himself.|$|E
50|$|Chapoutier {{produces}} {{wines from}} a range of <b>appellations</b> in northern and southern Rhône, as well as from some Roussillon <b>appellations,</b> and from collaborative projects in Portugal and Australia. The Chapoutier vineyards are all managed to produce biodynamic wines. A further characteristic of Chapoutier is a preference for single-variety wines, also from those <b>appellations</b> where blends are common. Thus, Chapoutier's Côte-Rôties are Syrah only (with no Viognier), the white Hermitages are all Marsanne only (with no Roussanne) and several of the Châteauneuf-du-Papes are Grenache noir only.|$|R

These are more similar to the wines of Provence.In 2004 ten new <b>appellations</b> were officially added to the Rhône region, 9 in the Gard {{and one in the}} Vaucluse, which largely parallel the wines of Southern Rhône proper, while two <b>appellations</b> were discontinued for reasons of reforesting and urban encroachment.|$|R
5|$|The Bordeaux wine region {{accounts}} for more than 60% of the Cabernet Sauvignon grown in France. Outside of Bordeaux, Cabernet Sauvignon is found in varying quantities throughout Le Midi and in the Loire Valley. In general, Cabernet Sauvignon wines are lighter and less structured, drinkable much earlier than Bordeaux wine. In the southwest French <b>appellation</b> d'origine contrôlée (AOCs) of Bergerac and Buzet it is used to make rosé wine. In some regions it is used to add flavor and structure to Carignan while it is blended with Négrette in Gaillac and Fronton as well as Tannat in Madiran. In Provence, the grape had some presence in the region in the mid 19th century, when viticulturist Jules Guyot recommended it as a blending partner with Syrah. In recent years, several Midi wine estates, such as Mas de Daumas Gassac have received international acclaim for their Cabernet Sauvignon blended in Hérault, with Rhône grapes like Syrah. It is often made as a single varietal in the vin de pays of the Languedoc. The influence of Australian flying winemakers has been considerable in how Cabernet Sauvignon is treated by some Languedoc wine estates, with some producers making wines that can seem like they are from the New World. Overall, the grape has not exerted it dominance of the region, generally considered less ideally situated to the dry climate than Syrah. The Languedoc producers who give serious consideration to Cabernet Sauvignon, generally rely on irrigation to compensate for the climate.|$|E
25|$|The <b>appellation</b> (Image example: Saint-Émilion) <b>Appellation</b> d'origine contrôlée laws {{dictate that}} all grapes must be {{harvested}} {{from a particular}} <b>appellation</b> in order for that <b>appellation</b> {{to appear on the}} label. The <b>appellation</b> is a key indicator of the type of wine in the bottle. With the image example, Pauillac wines are always red, and usually Cabernet Sauvignon is the dominant grape variety.|$|E
