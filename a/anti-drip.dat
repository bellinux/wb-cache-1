50|$|Rafael Marquina i Audouard (3 November 1921 - 6 June 2013) was a {{recognized}} Catalan designer and architect. He created a revolutionary <b>anti-drip</b> oil/vinegar cruet that, {{apart from the}} lovely design, is highly practical, i.e. it doesn't drip or get dirty.|$|E
50|$|In 1961, Marquina {{invented the}} <b>anti-drip</b> oil/vinegar cruet (decanter), an emblematic design {{that has been}} the object of {{numerous}} copies throughout the world. The design allows the user to dose the liquid. It consists of a glass container in the shape of two cones placed together, the lower one serving as the container for the oil or vinegar while the upper one catches any drops that may drip from the spout while allowing air to enter the recipient for easy flow of the oil or vinegar. The neck is buffed or frosted so as to keep the spout in place, and the spout can be easily removed for refilling the container.|$|E
40|$|CO {{emission}} peaks from {{fuel oil}} boilers in transient and cyclic regimes have been measured in previous studies. In order to evaluate these emissions, tests {{have been performed}} without and with an <b>anti-drip</b> system installed on the burner nozzle. Flue gas composition was measured using classical analysers (CO 2, O 2, CO and NOx) and CO emissions results were analysed and discussed. It {{was found that the}} <b>anti-drip</b> system reduced cold start CO emissions and did not affect steady-state CO emissions. At first, no reduction was noticed when the burner was cycling. Further investigation indicated that there was an experimental artefact caused by an air volume trapped in the pressure measurement system. When the air was purged and with the <b>anti-drip</b> system, CO peaks when the burner was cycling were strongly reduced and CO emissions remained under European standards limits...|$|E
40|$|Recent year's {{concerns}} about food safety, environmental pollution, worker's safety, {{resistance to chemicals}} {{and the need for}} rational use of energy stimulated extensive research concerning the development of alternative techniques in order to manage high humidity levels. Such a technique is the use of <b>anti-drip</b> (AD) and anti-fog (AF) polyethylene (PE) cover materials. Aim of this work was to study the effects of two AD PE cover materials on greenhouse microclimate and on growth and production of a hydroponic cucumber crop. The experiments were carried out from September to December of 2006 in three similar, heated greenhouses, covered by different cover materials. A standard greenhouse polyethylene (PE) cover film covered one of the three greenhouses (C-PE). The other two greenhouses were covered: the first by a PE film with <b>anti-drip</b> (AD) and anti-fog (AF) properties (AD+AF-PE) and the second one by a PE film with AD properties (AD-PE). The greenhouse and outside microclimate parameters along with crop growth and production were recorded. The results showed that the relative humidity levels were much higher in the AD-PE covered greenhouse. Furthermore, the temperature difference between the cover material and the dew point air temperature was more negative under the same greenhouse, leading in higher condensation rates over the PE film. The crop development and production was similar in the three greenhouses while the crop leaf area index values were slightly higher in the AD-PE covered greenhouse. Nevertheless, in order to control fungus development, the greenhouses covered by the C-PE and the AD-PE film needed about double fungicide applications, than the greenhouse covered by the AD+AF-PE film...|$|E
40|$|One {{important}} issue for greenhouse producers {{to deal with}} is the management of high humidity levels during the cold period of the year. High level of humidity is a factor that directly affects the fruit yield and quality of greenhouse crops by pre-disposing these crops to fungal diseases. Recent concerns about food safety, environmental pollution, worker's safety {{and the need for}} rational use of energy stimulated extensive research concerning the development of sustainable humidity management techniques. Such a technique is the use of <b>anti-drip</b> (AD) and anti-fog (AF) cover materials. Aim of this work was to study the effects of two AD PE cover materials on greenhouse microclimate and on growth and production of a hydroponic cucumber and tomato crop. The experiments were carried out from September to December 2006 and from February to May of 2007 in three similar greenhouses, covered by different cover materials. A standard polyethylene (PE) film covered one of the three greenhouses (C-PE). The other two greenhouses were covered: the first by a PE film with <b>anti-drip</b> (AD) and anti-fog (AF) properties (AD+AF-PE) and the second one by a PE film with AD properties (AD-PE).

40|$|To {{optimize}} {{the use of}} pesticides, several countries have carried out periodic inspections in agricultural sprayers. In Brazil, knowing the conditions of this machinery canguide researches and investments in guidelines for its use and maintenance. The objective {{of this study was}} to verify the state of sprayer maintenance used in the North of the state of Paran√°, in Brazil. Several sprayer items were evaluated, such as: presence, status and scale of the manometer, status of the hose, status of the <b>anti-drip</b> component, presence of leaks, status of the bar, status of the filters, state of the spraying nozzles and errors in the targeted flow rate. Machines were named as approved when there was no failure in any item evaluated. The factor that caused the biggest level of reprove among the machines was incorrect scale of manometers, which reproved 84. 55 % of the machines evaluated. Other outstanding factor was the incorrect flow rate in 75. 5 % of the tested machines. Only one unit was approved from the total of 110 evaluated sprayers...|$|E
40|$|Technical {{testing of}} the {{equipment}} {{for the application of}} plant protection products (PPP) was performed in Southeastern Slovenia in the period from 2004 to 2013. The technical conditions of boom or orchard sprayers was examined in details and the following parts were checked: drive, <b>anti-drip</b> valves, nozzles, filters, pipes and tubes, manometers, all valves, pressure regulators, agitator, pump, liquid discharge, spray solution reservoir and spray boom or fan system. The analysis revealed a poor condition of most devices in the initial years. However, technical suitability improved drastically until 2013. Technical condition was not directly related to the region of inspection although the lowest number of defective sprayers was recorded in the Posavje region. This can be linked to higher frequency of use and maintenance of the sprayers in this region as it stands out as the area with larger farms. Occasional technical disorders of the equipment can be recorded each year. It is therefore essential to continue with regular technical inspection to ensure optimal and accurate functioning of the sprayers...|$|E
40|$|The {{first chapter}} {{examines}} the non-halogenated flame retardant additives. The synthesis and blending of these various boron compounds are discussed and the blending of these additives into commercial polymers is addressed. The burn {{results of these}} polymer and additives blends are displayed. Chapter 2 shows the various halogenated flame retardant additives, based on the insecticide DDT and its many analogs. The synthesis and blending of these various halogenated flame retardant additives in several commercial polymers is examined. The burn results for these additives are shown and all perform as V- 0 material in the UL- 94 flammability test, when they are mixed with a synergist (antimony oxide) and an <b>anti-drip</b> additive (polytetrafluoroethylene). These compounds represent {{a new class of}} halogenated flame retardant additives, which could be used in commercial polymers. The third chapter outlines the new approach in making flame retardant polymers out of the DDT monomer and its various analogs. The synthesis and blending of these new flame retardant polymers into commercial plastics is examined. The burn results of these new polymer blends are summarized. Chapter 4 examines a new class of inherently flame retardant polymers, which incorporates the bisphenol C structure into these new polymers. The synthesis and blending of these novel flame retardant polymers is outlined. The burn results for these new polymers show that they all work as inherently flame retardant polymer without the need for a synergist. These polymers represent a new class of inherently flame retardant polymers...|$|E
