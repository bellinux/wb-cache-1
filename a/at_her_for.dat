5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he looks back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time.|$|E

500|$|Reviewer Alan Sepinwall {{also had}} mixed comments, {{comparing}} the episode to House and stating, [...] "And yet {{as much as}} Veronica was annoying me, as much as I wanted to yell <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> automatically jumping to conclusions with Weevil (more on that in a minute), this was maybe my favorite episode of the season. [...] Hell, they even had a cliffhanger ending to the mystery arc {{for the first time}} in forever. I dug it." [...] Price Peterson of TV.com gave a mostly negative review, writing, [...] "This episode was not the best! Not terrible by any means, but it felt lacking in certain ways, particularly when it came to the total lack of Piz and Dick. Where were they? Also this episode made it clear that Logan didn't have all that much to do on the show anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|Catherine had {{at least}} taken the {{precaution}} of marrying Margaret, her youngest daughter, to Navarre. Margaret, however, became almost {{as much of a}} thorn in Catherine's side as Francis, and in 1582, she returned to the French court without her husband. Catherine was heard yelling <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> taking lovers. Catherine sent Pomponne de Bellièvre to Navarre to arrange Margaret's return. In 1585, Margaret fled Navarre again. She retreated to her property at Agen and begged her mother for money. Catherine sent her only enough [...] "to put food on her table". Moving on to the fortress of Carlat, Margaret took a lover called d'Aubiac. Catherine asked Henry to act before Margaret brought shame on them again. In October 1586, therefore, he had Margaret locked up in the Château d'Usson. D'Aubiac was executed, though not, despite Catherine's wish, in front of Margaret. Catherine cut Margaret out of her will and never saw her again.|$|E

500|$|From {{the age of}} 11, Kylie {{appeared}} in small roles in soap operas including The Sullivans and Skyways. In 1985, she was cast {{in one of the}} lead roles in The Henderson Kids. Minogue took time off school to film The Henderson Kids and while Carol was not impressed, Minogue felt that she needed the independence to make it into the entertainment industry. During filming, co-star Nadine Garner labelled Minogue [...] "fragile" [...] after producers yelled <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> forgetting her lines; she would often cry on set. Minogue was dropped from the second season of the show after producer Alan Hardy felt the need for her character to be [...] "written off". In retrospect, Hardy stated that removing her from the showing [...] "turned out to be the best thing for her". Interested in following a career in music, Minogue made a demo tape for the producers of weekly music program Young Talent Time, which featured Dannii as a regular performer. Kylie gave her first television singing performance on the show in 1985 but was not invited to join the cast. Kylie was cast in the soap opera Neighbours in 1986, as Charlene Mitchell, a schoolgirl turned garage mechanic.

2500|$|They {{were married}} in a small civil {{ceremony}} in the Marylebone area of London on March 12, 1969. British fans had a mostly negative reaction to the marriage, partly because it ended McCartney's status as the last unattached Beatle. Along with John Lennon's new wife, Yoko Ono (whom Lennon married a week later), Linda was perceived {{as one of the}} causes of the group's break-up. Lennon at one point publicly criticized the way the press had treated Linda: [...] "She got the same kind of insults, hatred, absolute garbage thrown <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> no reason whatsoever other than {{she fell in love with}} Paul McCartney." ...|$|E

Her last thought before she died was, [...] "Why has no one ever loved me?" [...] Daisy is sent from New York City to Seattle in episode six as a replacement when Betty leaves. She is traumatically affected by violent male deaths committed against defenseless women, and although Roxy yelled <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> tampering with a crime scene after such a reap, Daisy then revealed to Mason that she had a sister who (presumably) died that way. At the end of Season 2, Daisy begins to acquire a reputation as a [...] "bad luck charm" [...] when Ray accuses her of killing people. When Ray's soul is transformed into a graveling, she enigmatically states in that and the next episode that she's [...] "seen it before" [...] and that it's [...] "happening again." [...] Daisy is recognized in the last episode by an elderly man in Der Waffle Haus while she is dressed as a police officer for Halloween; as stated in that episode, on Halloween, all reapers look as they did when alive.|$|E

Hilary said she refrained from co-writing the entire album because [...] "I don't know if I'm secure enough with myself to do that".

The Scoop, a gossip section of the website MSNBC, quoted an insider who had said, [...] "Hilary thinks that Lindsay has been directing negativity <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> too long." [...] Duff denied that the rumors were true, saying she did not know Lohan and would not write a song about her. She said that at the time she wrote it she was feeling she had to openly discuss her personal life because [...] "people make accusations and there are lies and rumors constantly ... people are so negative. They love to read what's coming out next on Page Six [...] and I just felt like it was appropriate." [...] She said she felt [...] "normal girls" [...] could relate to the song because of the [...] "petty stuff" [...] that occurs in schools.|$|E
