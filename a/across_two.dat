5|$|Alford {{was signed}} by the BC Lions and participated at {{training}} camp in 1996, but he was cut from the roster in late June. Despite not being offered {{a spot on the}} practice squad, Alford remained in Surrey and practiced with the Lions for free. He was signed onto the active roster in late July after the Lions cut receivers Darryl Frazier and Clarence Verdin. Alford made his CFL debut against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats on July 27, 1996. After recording over 200 receiving yards <b>across</b> <b>two</b> games in August, Alford began starting at wide receiver. He finished the season as the second most-productive Lions receiver with 721 receiving yards, leading the team to nominate Alford for the league-wide Most Outstanding Rookie award.|$|E
5|$|At {{a border}} {{post on the}} way to Paraguay, Cacambo and Candide speak to the commandant, who turns out to be Cunégonde's unnamed brother. He {{explains}} that after his family was slaughtered, the Jesuits' preparation for his burial revived him, and he has since joined the order. When Candide proclaims he intends to marry Cunégonde, her brother attacks him, and Candide runs him through with his rapier. After lamenting all the people (mainly priests) he has killed, he and Cacambo flee. In their flight, Candide and Cacambo come <b>across</b> <b>two</b> naked women being chased and bitten by a pair of monkeys. Candide, seeking to protect the women, shoots and kills the monkeys, but is informed by Cacambo that the monkeys and women were probably lovers.|$|E
5|$|Bridging wires are rods that couple {{together}} resonators {{that are}} not adjacent. They {{can be used to}} produce poles of attenuation in the stopband. This has the benefit of increasing the stopband rejection. When the pole is placed near the passband edge, it also has the benefit of increasing roll-off and narrowing the transition band. The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response are shown in figure 11. Bridging across a single resonator (figure 11b) can produce a pole of attenuation in the high stopband. Bridging <b>across</b> <b>two</b> resonators (figure 11c) can produce a pole of attenuation in both the high and the low stopband. Using multiple bridges (figure 11d) will result in multiple poles of attenuation. In this way, the attenuation of the stopbands can be deepened over a broad frequency range.|$|E

5|$|The 32nd Battalion was to {{commence}} its attack at Bellicourt at 09:00 on 29 September, and move south through the village. Due to mist and smoke from a preceding artillery barrage, visibility was poor. When the advance {{was held up}} by two German machine guns, Wark ordered a tank to neutralise them. On reaching {{the southern end of}} St Quentin Canal tunnel, Wark came <b>across</b> <b>two</b> hundred troops of the American 117th Infantry Regiment who appeared to be leaderless, and attached them to his own command. A short time later, with visibility still poor, he appropriated armoured reinforcements and began an advance on the village of Nauroy. As the fog began to lift, Wark organised his troops for an attack on the village from a southerly direction. By 11:30, the battalion had taken the village, along with forty Germans as prisoners of war.|$|E

5|$|Uttarakhand has a multiethnic {{population}} spread <b>across</b> <b>two</b> geocultural regions: the Garhwal, and the Kumaon. A {{large portion}} of the population is Rajput (various clans of erstwhile landowning rulers and their descendants), including members of the native Garhwali, Kumaoni and Gujjar communities, {{as well as a number}} of immigrants. According to a 2007 study by Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Uttarakhand has the highest percentage of Brahmins of any state in India, with approximately 20% of the population being Brahmin. 18.76% of the population belongs to the Scheduled Castes (an official term for the lower castes in the traditional Hindu caste system). Scheduled Tribes (an official term for natives outside the Indian social system), such as the Tharu, Jaunsari, Buksa, Bhotiya and Raji constitute 2.89% of the population.|$|E
5|$|Deregulation in the 1980s, {{culminating}} in the Big Bang in 1986, also encouraged the bank to enter the securities business. County Bank, its merchant banking subsidiary formed in 1965, acquired various stockbroking and jobbing firms to create the investment banking arm County NatWest. National Westminster Home Loans was established in 1980 and other initiatives included {{the launch of the}} Piggy Account for children in 1983, the Credit Zone, a flexible overdraft facility on which customers only pay interest (now commonplace, this so-called pink debt was innovative when launched) and the development of the Mondex electronic purse (later sold to MasterCard Worldwide) in 1990. The Action Bank advertising campaign spearheaded a new marketing-led approach to business development. Under the direction of Robin Leigh-Pemberton, later Lord Kingsdown, who became chairman in 1977, the bank also expanded internationally, forming National Westminster Bancorp in the United States of America with a network of 340 branches <b>across</b> <b>two</b> states, National Westminster Bank of Canada and NatWest Australia Bank; and opening branches on the European continent and in the Far East. In 1982, the Frankfurt office of International Westminster Bank merged with Global Bank AG to form Deutsche Westminster Bank. In 1985, Banco NatWest España was formed and National Westminster Bank SA was incorporated in 1988, taking over the bank's six branches in France and Monaco. In 1989, International Westminster Bank was merged into National Westminster Bank by Act of Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Despite Bompart's {{attempts}} to disguise his destination, by {{the evening of}} 23 September Countess had correctly deduced the French were heading for Ireland, and despatched the brig Sylph to warn Commodore Warren and any other British ships she came <b>across.</b> <b>Two</b> days later, on 25 September, Commodore Bompart was forced to haul {{to the east and}} lose ground to his pursuers when a 100-ship British convoy passed to the north. This convoy consisted of many well-armed East Indiamen, protected by several frigates, and posed a serious threat to Bompart's overloaded ships. He then tried to drive off pursuit by feinting towards Countess's squadron, but the faster British ships simply withdrew to a safe distance, resuming their chase once the French had returned to their original course. On 29 September Bompart made a final bid to shake his pursuers; he attempted to engage the British frigates with three of his own—Immortalité, Loire and another. This plan failed after his flagship Hoche lost a topmast in heavy weather and fell behind the rest of the squadron, forcing the frigates to return to her protection.|$|E
