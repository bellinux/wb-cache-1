5|$|Raskolnikov is at {{this point}} {{completely}} torn; he is urged by Sonya to confess, and Svidrigaïlov's testimony could potentially convict him. Furthermore, Porfiry confronts Raskolnikov with his suspicions and assures him that confession would substantially lighten his sentence. Meanwhile, Svidrigaïlov attempts to seduce Dunya, but when he realizes that she will never love him, he lets her go. He then spends a night in confusion and in the morning shoots himself. This same morning, Raskolnikov goes again to Sonya, who again urges him to confess and to clear his conscience. He makes his way to the police station, where he is met by the news of Svidrigaïlov's suicide. He hesitates a moment, thinking <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might get away with a perfect crime, but is persuaded by Sonya to confess.|$|E

Australia were playing Pakistan and were losing badly when Hussey proved yet <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{brilliant}} with the tail end, scoring an unbeaten 134. This innings with Peter Siddle who scored 38 potentially saved the match as Australia went from a terrible position to a reasonable one and ended up winning the match with Michael Hussey named man of the match for his heroic effort.|$|E
25|$|When Robertson began {{claiming}} <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{a combat}} veteran during the 1988 Republican primaries, McCloskey wrote a public letter to U.S. Representative Andrew Jacobs Jr., also a Marine {{veteran of the}} Korean War, in which McCloskey said that Robertson was actually spared combat duty when his powerful father, U.S. Senator A. Willis Robertson of Virginia, intervened on his behalf, and that Robertson had actually boasted that his father would {{keep him out of}} combat. Robertson, a college friend, and four other second lieutenants were shipped to Japan, detailed to a training mission for Marines coming out of Korea. Of the remaining Marine officers, half were killed or wounded in combat.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} season Hauritz {{found himself}} out of favour once more, playing only one first class game for New South Wales, although he played in eight one-day domestic games {{as part of the}} Ford Ranger Cup. The 2008–09 season began only a little better for Hauritz, playing the first couple of matches of the Sheffield Shield competition and a tour game against New Zealand, however, he found himself not selected for New South Wales' next Shield game and it seemed once <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might {{spend the rest of the}} season on the sidelines. A surprise return to the Australian Test team for the 2nd Test against New Zealand, however, seemed to offer him a lifeline and after a creditable performance against New Zealand in the Test at Adelaide, Hauritz found himself back in the New South Wales side, playing two more Sheffield Shield games in which he took ten wickets—including a career best 4/86—before being called for international duty in South Africa.|$|E

500|$|He {{returned}} in 1887 to England, where, although not officially divorced from Mary Ann Bryant, {{he married a}} music hall singer, Lily Enever. In 1895, for a fee {{of a few hundred}} pounds, he confessed in The People newspaper that he was, after all, Arthur Orton. With the proceeds he opened a small tobacconist's shop in Islington; however, he quickly retracted the confession and insisted <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was Roger Tichborne. His shop failed, as did other business attempts, and he died destitute, of heart disease, on 1 April 1898. His funeral caused a brief revival of interest; around 5,000 people attended Paddington cemetery for the burial in an unmarked pauper's grave. In what McWilliam calls [...] "an act of extraordinary generosity" [...] the Tichborne family allowed a card bearing the name [...] "Sir Roger Charles Doughty Tichborne" [...] to be placed on the coffin before its interment. The name [...] "Tichborne" [...] was registered in the cemetery's records.|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{political}} subtleties of the Second Settlement seem to have evaded the comprehension of the Plebeian class, who were Augustus' greatest supporters and clientele. This caused them to insist upon Augustus' participation in imperial affairs from time to time. Augustus failed to stand for election as consul in 22BC, and fears arose once <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was being forced from power by the aristocratic Senate. In 22, 21, and 19BC, the people rioted in response, and only allowed a single consul to be elected for each of those years, ostensibly to leave the other position open for Augustus. Likewise, there was a food shortage in Rome in 22BC which sparked panic, while many urban plebs called for Augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee the crisis. After a theatrical display of refusal before the Senate, Augustus finally accepted authority over Rome's grain supply [...] "by virtue of his proconsular imperium", and ended the crisis almost immediately. It was not until AD 8 that a food crisis of this sort prompted Augustus to establish a praefectus annonae, a permanent prefect {{who was in charge}} of procuring food supplies for Rome.|$|E
500|$|Akhtar's {{next project}} was Lakshya (2004), {{a film about}} an aimless youngster finally setting a goal for himself, {{starring}} Hrithik Roshan and Preity Zinta. It was shot in Ladakh, Dehra Dun and Mumbai, and {{marked the beginning of}} the collaborations between Akhtar and Hrithik. He had to research the army before writing the script and directing the venture. The theme of the film, as stated by Akhtar, was about [...] "finding oneself". He also believed that if the same characters and situation were set elsewhere, the main core of the story would remain the same as the film was not about war, as it had been reported. Post-release, the film failed to make a mark at the box office and became a commercial failure. Parul Gupta of The Times of India gave it a negative review and explained that [...] "It's hard to reconcile to such triviality when it comes from Farhan Akhtar, considered the ultimate symbol of cool in Hindi filmdom." [...] On the contrary, Manish Gajjar from BBC wrote, in his positive review: [...] "Young Farhan Akhtar, proves yet <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is one of the finest directors Bollywood has to date. He has paid full attention to the script and the technical aspects, giving rise to a polished product".|$|E

500|$|At the 2008 World Championships, O'Sullivan {{compiled}} a record-breaking ninth competitive maximum break against Mark Williams. It was his {{third of the}} season, and also his third maximum at the Crucible. It was the fourth maximum to be compiled in a winning frame of a match (following those of Hendry, Williams, and O'Sullivan himself). Interviewed by Steve Davis just after beating Williams 13–7, he said [...] "I can finally buy a Bentley Continental GT". Soon after O'Sullivan potted the final black, commentator Dennis Taylor called him a [...] "total genius". However, O'Sullivan's 147 was equalled by Ali Carter in the same tournament, thus halving the prize money. O'Sullivan defeated Liu Chuang, Mark Williams, Liang Wenbo and Stephen Hendry {{en route to the}} final of the tournament. After the match, Hendry described O'Sullivan as [...] "the best in the world by a country mile". He then beat Carter 18–8 to win the title on 5 May. In an interview after his third world title win, he hinted <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might not play in the 2008/2009 season, but also stated that he might go on to pursue many more world titles.

500|$|In 2012, Rick Hess of the American Enterprise Institute {{stated that}} on [...] "education, training, employment, and social services, the Ryan budget would spend 33% less" [...] than Obama's budget plan {{over the next}} decade. In particular, the Ryan plan {{tightened}} eligibility requirements for Pell Grants and froze the maximum Pell Grant award at the then-current level. According to an analysis by the Education Trust, this {{would have resulted in}} more than 1 million students losing Pell Grants over the next 10 years. Additionally, under Ryan's plan, student loans would have begun to accrue interest while students were still in school. Ryan stated that his education policy is to [...] "allocate our limited financial resources effectively and efficiently to improve education". Jordan Weissmann of The Atlantic said that Ryan's vision on education policy is to [...] "cut and privatize". National Education Association President Dennis Van Roekel criticized Ryan's positions on education in 2012 saying: [...] "By selecting Ryan, Romney has doubled down on his view that opportunity is only for those who can afford it or are willing to game the system. He’s shown yet <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is more willing to help the rich get richer than ensuring middle class families get ahead." ...|$|E
500|$|On December 27, {{after an}} injury to guard Iman Shumpert, the New York Knicks claimed Lin off of waivers to be a backup behind Toney Douglas and Mike Bibby. Recently signed guard Baron Davis had also been injured, and was weeks away {{from being able to}} play. Because of the lockout, coaches had had little {{opportunity}} to see Lin's play, and placed him fourth on the point guard depth chart. Lin stated that he was [...] "competing for a backup spot", and people saw him [...] "as the 12th to 15th guy on the roster. It's a numbers game," [...] yet he continued to arrive first at practice, and leave last, intensely studying game film, and working with coaches to improve his footwork and judgment. He made his season debut with the Knicks on the road against the Warriors, where he was warmly cheered in his return to Oracle Arena. In January, Lin was assigned to the Erie BayHawks of the D-League, and on January 20, he scored a triple-double with 28 points, 11 rebounds, and 12 assists in the BayHawks' 122–113 victory over the Maine Red Claws. Three days later, Lin was recalled by the Knicks, but was so fearful of being cut <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> asked a chaplain at a pregame prayer service to pray for him. If he were to be released again, Lin would consider playing in Europe, returning to the D-League, or taking a non-basketball job.|$|E

500|$|In another {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, the actor spoke thoroughly of his departure, saying: [...] "It's {{not that one}} hadn't agreed to a reduction, but they hit you with a sledgehammer. It's done in such an insulting fashion. It could have been dealt with in a far more gracious way. It is cold and hard-nosed... The whole thing was so calculated it was unbelievable... It's not even about the money." [...] Despite this, during contract negotiations, Braeden refused {{to say that he}} had departed fully, but did not know when a return would occur. However, within weeks, news broke that the actor and the series had managed a new contract. In a statement issued by CBS Daytime, they said: [...] "We're very happy that Eric will be remaining with The Young and the Restless. Victor Newman has been {{an important part of the}} Genoa City canvas for nearly 30 years, and we know our audience will be tuning in to see what his plans are next." [...] Onscreen, Braeden exited November 2, 2009, and made his return on January 15, 2010. That same year, the actor celebrated thirty years on the soap opera. In 2012, Braeden experienced further contract negotiations and speculation arose <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be leaving. Published reports said that Victor would be absent from the canvas for two weeks and that his contract expired that November. Two months later, it was announced that the actor had signed a new contract with The Young and the Restless, furthering his portrayal of Victor for an unspecified period of time. Braeden stated that he was [...] "very glad we got the negotiations successfully behind us".|$|E
500|$|Languages differ {{widely in}} how much they rely on {{morphological}} processes of word formation. In some languages, for example, Chinese, there are no morphological processes, and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words. This type of morpho-syntax is often called isolating, or analytic, because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning. Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes, but they vary in {{the degree to which}} morphemes are discrete units. In many languages, notably in most Indo-European languages, single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments. For example, in Latin, the word bonus, or [...] "good", consists of the root bon-, meaning [...] "good", and the suffix -us, which indicates masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. These languages are called fusional languages, because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme. The opposite of fusional languages are agglutinative languages which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit. An example of such a language is Turkish, where for example, the word evlerinizden, or [...] "from your houses", consists of the morphemes, ev-ler-iniz-den with the meanings house-plural-your-from. The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called polysynthetic languages. They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word. For example, in Persian the single word nafahmidamesh means I didn't understand it consisting of morphemes na-fahm-id-am-esh with the meanings, [...] "negation.understand.past.I.it". As another example with more complexity, in the Yupik word tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq, which means [...] "He had not yet said <b>again</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was going to hunt reindeer", the word consists of the morphemes tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq with the meanings, [...] "reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative", and except for the morpheme tuntu ("reindeer") none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.|$|E
