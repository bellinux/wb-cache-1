40|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> is a {{relatively}} new scientific and technological field which studies the nature of intelligence by using computers to produce intelligent behaviour. Initially, the main goal was a purely scientific one, understanding human intelligence, and this remains the aim of cognitive scientists. Unfortunately, such an ambitious and fascinating goal is not only far from being achieved but has yet to be satisfactorily approached. Fortunately, however, <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> also has an engineering goal: building systems that are useful to people even if the intelligence of such systems has no relation whatsoever with human intelligence, and therefore being able to build them does not necessarily provide any insight into the nature of human intelligence. This engineering goal has become the predominant one among <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> researchers and has produced impressive results, ranging from knowledge-based systems to autonomous robots, that have been applied to many different domains. Furthermore, <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>products</b> and services today represent an annual market of {{tens of billions of dollars}} worldwide...|$|R

40|$|Highly {{stretchable}} {{and durable}} conductors are significant {{to the development}} of wearable devices, robots, human-machine interfaces and other <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>products.</b> Although many respectable methods have been reported, it is still a challenge to fabricate stretchable conductors with a large elastic limit, high conductivity and excellent reliability in rapid, effective and economic ways. Herein, a facile method is offered to fabricate high-performance stretchable tubular conductors (TCs) based on a macro-confined structure of expanded graphite (EG) in rubber tubing by simply physical packing. The maximum original electrical conductivity of TC reached a high value of 160. 6 S/cm. Meanwhile, TCs showed more insensitive response of conductivity to increasing tensile strain compared to tubular conductors encapsulated with liquid metal or ionic liquid. The conductivity and effective stretchability of TCs can be adjusted by varying the packing density of EG. A low gauge factor below 3 was reached even under 400 % stretching for TC with a packing density of 1. 233 g/cm 3. The excellent resilience and good stability of conductivity of TC during dynamic stretching-releasing cycles are attributed to stable and rapid reconstruction of the percolation network of EG particles. The combination of high conductivity, tunable stretchability and good reliability renders TC with potential applications such as highly stretchable interconnects or strain sensors in human motion detection...|$|R

40|$|D. Phil. Computer-based {{information}} systems will probably {{always have to}} contend with security issues. Much research have already gone into the field of information security. These research results have yielded some very sophisticated and effective security mechanisms and procedures. However, due to the ever increasing sophistication of criminals, combined with the ever changing and evolving information technology environment, some limitations still exist within the field of information security. Recent years have seen the proliferation of <b>products</b> embracing so-called <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> technologies. These <b>products</b> are in fields as diverse as engineering, business and medicine. The successes achieved in these fields pose the question whether <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> has a role to play within the field of information security. This thesis discusses limitations within information security and proposes ways in which <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> can be effectively applied to address these limitations. Specifically, the fields of authentication and risk analysis are identified as research fields where <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> has much to offer. These fields are explored {{in the context of their}} limitations and ways in which <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> can be applied to address these limitations. This thesis identifies two mainstream approaches in the attainment of <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence.</b> These mainstream approaches are referred to as the "traditional" approach and the "non-traditional" approach. The traditional approach is based on symbolic processing, as opposed to the non-traditional approach, which is based on an abstraction of human reasoning. A representative technology from each of these mainstream approaches is selected to research their applicability within information security. Actual working prototypes of <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> techniques were developed to substantiate the results obtained in this research...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} new <b>Artificial</b> <b>Intelligence</b> (AI) based <b>product</b> development approach for integrating mechanical design with electronic design to improve design and manufacture of electromechanical products by avoiding design {{conflicts in the}} early stages of the design process.

The system assists designers from different disciplines in evaluating complex systems as far as parts relation, potential effects on each other, conflict management, costs, weight and physical constraints are concerned in the early design stages. This helps the designers to avoid design iterations leading to longer lead-time, hence increased cost. The developed system enables to rapidly develop and evaluate new complex products and add new functions to the existing products within given constraints...|$|R
