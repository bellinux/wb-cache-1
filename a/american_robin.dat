5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>robin</b> is a known {{reservoir}} (carrier) for West Nile virus. While crows and jays {{are often}} the first noticed deaths in an area with West Nile virus, the <b>American</b> <b>robin</b> is suspected {{to be a key}} host, and holds a larger responsibility for the transmission of the virus to humans. This is because, while crows and jays die quickly from the virus, the <b>American</b> <b>robin</b> survives the virus longer, hence spreading it to more mosquitoes, which then transmit the virus to humans and other species.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{subspecies}} of <b>American</b> <b>robin</b> are recognized. These subspecies intergrade and {{are only}} weakly defined.|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>robin</b> (Turdus migratorius) is a migratory {{songbird}} of the thrush family. It {{is named}} after the European robin because of its reddish-orange breast, though the two species are not closely related, with the European robin belonging to the Old World flycatcher family. The <b>American</b> <b>robin</b> is widely distributed throughout North America, wintering from southern Canada to central Mexico and along the Pacific Coast. It is the state bird of Connecticut, Michigan, and Wisconsin. According to some sources, the <b>American</b> <b>robin</b> ranks behind only the red-winged blackbird (and {{just ahead of the}} introduced European starling and the not-always-naturally-occurring house finch) as the most abundant extant land bird in North America. It has seven subspecies, but only T. m. confinis of Baja California Sur is particularly distinctive, with pale gray-brown underparts.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} bird species also inhabit the area near Negro Hollow. These include <b>American</b> <b>robins,</b> hermit thrushes, Cooper's hawks, winter wrens, and pileated woodpeckers. <b>American</b> <b>robins</b> are {{especially}} common near the stream.|$|R

5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>robin</b> {{is active}} mostly during the day, {{and on its}} winter grounds it assembles in large flocks at night to roost in trees in secluded swamps or dense vegetation. The flocks break up during {{the day when the}} birds feed on fruits and berries in smaller groups. During the summer, the <b>American</b> <b>robin</b> defends a {{breeding}} territory and is less social.|$|E
5|$|Bird banders {{have found}} that only 25% of young robins survive the first year. The longest known {{lifespan}} in the wild of an <b>American</b> <b>robin</b> is 14years; the average lifespan is about 2years.|$|E
5|$|Lundy has {{attracted}} many vagrant birds, in particular species from North America. The island's bird list totals 317 species. This has {{included the following}} species, each of which represents the sole British record: Ancient murrelet, eastern phoebe and eastern towhee. Records of bimaculated lark, <b>American</b> <b>robin</b> and common yellowthroat were also firsts for Britain (<b>American</b> <b>robin</b> has also occurred two further times on Lundy). Veerys in 1987 and 1997 were Britain's second and fourth records, a RÃ¼ppell's warbler in 1979 was Britain's second, an eastern Bonelli's warbler in 2004 was Britain's fourth, and a black-faced bunting in 2001 Britain's third.|$|E

40|$|To {{explore the}} {{competence}} of <b>American</b> <b>robins</b> as a reservoir for Lyme disease spirochetes, we determined the susceptibility of these birds to tickborne spirochetes and their subsequent infectivity for larval vector ticks. Robins acquired infection and became infectious to almost all xenodiagnostic ticks soon after exposure to infected nymphal ticks. Although infectivity waned after 2 months, the robins remained susceptible to reinfection, became infectious again, and permitted repeated feeding by vector ticks. In addition, spirochetes passaged through birds retained infectivity for mammalian hosts. <b>American</b> <b>robins</b> become as infectious for vector ticks as do reservoir mice, but infectivity in robins wanes more rapidly...|$|R
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>robin</b> {{begins to}} breed shortly after {{returning}} to its summer range. It {{is one of the}} first North American bird species to lay eggs, and normally has two to three broods per breeding season, which lasts from April to July.|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>robin</b> is {{the state}} bird of Connecticut, Michigan, and Wisconsin. It was also {{depicted}} on the 1986 Birds of Canada series Canadian $2 note, but this note has since been withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>robin</b> {{is known}} to be a rejecter of cowbird eggs, so brood {{parasitism}} by the brown-headed cowbird is rare. Even when it occurs, the parasite's chick does not normally survive to fledging. In a study of 105 juvenile robins, 77.1% were infected with one or more species of endoparasite, with Syngamus species the most commonly encountered, found in 57.1% of the birds.|$|E

5|$|The Peace Bridge robins were {{a family}} of <b>American</b> <b>robins</b> that {{attracted}} minor publicity in the mid-1930s for their prominent nest on the Canadian side of the Peace Bridge connecting Buffalo, New York to Fort Erie, Ontario.|$|R
50|$|They are {{visited by}} butterflies, {{and have a}} mild, hawthorn-like scent. The fruit are {{consumed}} by birds, including mockingbirds, <b>American</b> <b>robins,</b> cedar waxwings and hermit thrushes. Mammals including coyotes and bears also eat and disperse the pomes.|$|R
5|$|The male <b>American</b> <b>robin,</b> as {{with many}} thrushes, has a complex and almost {{continuous}} song. Its song is commonly described as a cheerily carol, made up of discrete units, often repeated, and spliced together into a string with brief pauses in between. The song varies regionally, and its style varies by time of day. The song period is from late February or early March to late July or early August; some birds, particularly in the east, sing occasionally into September or later. The <b>American</b> <b>robin</b> is often among the first songbirds singing as dawn rises or hours before, and last as evening sets in. It usually sings from a high perch in a tree. The song of T. m. confinis is weaker {{than that of the}} nominate subspecies, and lacks any clear notes.|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>robin</b> has a {{place in}} Native American mythology. The {{story of how the}} robin got its red breast by fanning the dying flames of a campfire to save a Native American man and a boy is similar to those that {{surround}} the European robin. The Tlingit people of Northwestern North America held it to be a culture hero created by Raven to please the people with its song. One of the houses of the Raven Tribe from the Nisga'a Nation holds the robin as a house crest.|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>robin</b> has an {{extensive}} range, estimated at , {{and a large}} population of about 320million individuals. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as least concern. At one point, the bird was killed for its meat, but it is now protected throughout its range in the United States by the Migratory Bird Act.|$|E
5000|$|Birds {{are seen}} {{frequently}} around camp areas and near dense patches of shrubs. The natives include blackbirds, black-throated sparrows, finches, American kestrels, small hawks, ravens, roadrunners, <b>American</b> <b>robins,</b> sapsuckers, and introduced European starlings. Migratory birds include bluebirds, cedar waxwings, hummingbirds, and warblers.|$|R
40|$|In {{the eastern}} United States, human cases of West Nile virus (WNV) result from {{spillover}} from urban epizootic transmission between passerine birds and Culex mosquitoes. In Atlanta, GA, substantial WNV presence in hosts and vectors has not {{resulted in the}} human disease burden observed in cities with similar infection pressure. Our study goal was to investigate extrinsic ecological conditions that potentially contribute to these reduced transmission rates. We conducted WNV surveillance among hosts and vectors in urban Atlanta and recorded an overall avian seroprevalence of nearly 30 %, which was significantly higher among northern cardinals, blue jays, {{and members of the}} mimid family, and notably low among <b>American</b> <b>robins.</b> Examination of temporal Culex feeding patterns showed a marked feeding shift from <b>American</b> <b>robins</b> in the early season to northern cardinals in the late season. We therefore rule out <b>American</b> <b>robins</b> as superspreaders in the Atlanta area and suggest instead that northern cardinals and mimids act as WNV "supersuppressor" species, which slow WNV transmission by drawing many infectious bites during the critical virus amplification period, yet failing to amplify transmission due to low host competencies. Of particular interest, urban forest patches provide spillover protection by increasing the WNV amplification fraction on supersuppressor species...|$|R
40|$|Traits that {{converge}} {{in appearance}} under similar environmental conditions among phylogenetically independent lineages {{are thought to}} represent adaptations to local environments. We tested for convergence in nest morphology and composition of birds breeding in two ecologically different locations in Canada: Churchill in northern Manitoba and Elgin in southeastern Ontario. We examined nests from four families of passerine birds (Turdidae: Turdus, Parulidae: Dendroica, Emberizidae: Passerculus and Fringillidae: Carduelis) where closely related populations or species breed in both locations. Nests of <b>American</b> <b>Robins,</b> Yellow Warblers, and Carduelis finches had heavier nest masses, and tended to have thicker nestwalls, in northern Manitoba compared with conspecifics or congenerics breeding in southeastern Ontario. Together, all species showed evidence for wider internal and external nest-cup diameters in northern Manitoba, while individual species showed varying patterns for internal nest-cup and external nest depths. <b>American</b> <b>Robins,</b> Yellow Warblers, and Carduelis finches in northern Manitoba achieved heavier nest masses in different ways. <b>American</b> <b>Robins</b> increased all materials in similar proportions, and Yellow Warblers and Common Redpolls used greater amounts of select materials. While changes in nest composition vary uniquely for each species, the pattern of larger nests in northern Manitoba compared to southeastern Ontario in three of our four phylogenetically-independent comparisons suggests that birds are adapting to similar selectiv...|$|R
5|$|The robin also sings when storms {{approach}} and again when storms have passed. In {{addition to its}} song, the <b>American</b> <b>robin</b> {{has a number of}} calls used for communicating specific information such as when a ground predator approaches, and when a nest or robin is being directly threatened. Even during nesting season, when robins exhibit mostly competitive and territorial behavior, they may still band together to drive away a predator.|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>robin</b> {{is active}} mostly {{during the day}} and assembles in large flocks at night. Its diet {{consists}} of invertebrates (such as beetle grubs, earthworms, and caterpillars), fruits, and berries. It is one of the earliest bird species to lay eggs, beginning to breed shortly after returning to its summer range from its winter range. Its nest consists of long coarse grass, twigs, paper, and feathers, and is smeared with mud and often cushioned with grass or other soft materials. It {{is one of the first}} birds to sing at dawn, and its song consists of several discrete units that are repeated.|$|E
5|$|Juvenile robins {{and eggs}} are preyed upon by squirrels, snakes, and some birds, such as blue jays, Steller's jay, common grackles, American crows, and common ravens. Adults are {{primarily}} taken by Accipiter hawks, cats, dogs, and larger snakes (especially rat snakes). They {{may be taken}} by nearly every variety of North American accipitrid, from the smallest, the sharp-shinned hawk, {{to one of the}} two largest, the golden eagle, most every North American falcon from the smallest, the American kestrel, to the largest, the gyrfalcon, and almost all owl species from northern pygmy owls to snowy owls. Overall, 28 raptorial bird species are known to hunt robins. Adult robins are most vulnerable when distracted by breeding activities though may also be attacked on the ground or even in flight. However, when feeding in flocks, the <b>American</b> <b>robin</b> is able to remain vigilant and watch other flock members for reactions to predators.|$|E
50|$|About 93 {{species of}} birds inhabit Wrangell-St. Elias, though only 24 remain during the harsh winter.

5|$|Of the 127 {{bird species}} found along the Merced River, only 35 occur {{along the entire}} length of the river. Many of these birds are migratory and only pass the area a few times every year, while 109 species of birds are found only in the {{breeding}} season. Birds are more abundant along the slow-moving lower river, which has more suitable riparian habitat compared to the rocky, swift upper river. Common species of bird throughout the basin include ruby-crowned kinglet, cedar waxwing, <b>American</b> <b>robin,</b> yellow-rumped warbler, tree swallow and European starling, and several endangered species, including white-tailed kite and Swainson's hawk. Birds that occur commonly in the middle and upper sections of the Merced River include mourning dove, Cassin's finch, California quail, dark-eyed junco, woodpecker, dipper, great blue heron, scrub jay, red-winged blackbird, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, cliff swallow, canyon wren, merganser, and bald eagles. Common insects found along the river include mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies. The river is impacted by invasive Asiatic clam, Chinese mitten crab, and New Zealand mud snail.|$|E
