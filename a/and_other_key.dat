5|$|At Nhu's request, Tung was {{reported}} to have been planning an operation under the cover of a government-organised student demonstration outside the US Embassy, Saigon. In this plan, Tung's men would assassinate ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>key</b> officials among the confusion. Another target was the Buddhist leader Thích Trí Quang, who had been given asylum in the embassy after being targeted in the pagoda raids. According to the plan, Tung's men would then burn down the embassy.|$|E

5|$|Many {{emerging}} {{nations of}} Asia, Africa, and Latin America rejected {{the pressure to}} choose sides in the East-West competition. In 1955, at the Bandung Conference in Indonesia, dozens of Third World governments resolved {{to stay out of}} the Cold War. The consensus reached at Bandung culminated with the creation of the Belgrade-headquartered Non-Aligned Movement in 1961. Meanwhile, Khrushchev broadened Moscow's policy to establish ties with India <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>key</b> neutral states. Independence movements in the Third World transformed the post-war order into a more pluralistic world of decolonized African and Middle Eastern nations and of rising nationalism in Asia and Latin America.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the London Missionary Society missionaries, whose primary activity was teaching Christian theology and literacy at their newly established schools using the Bible as the principal Malagasy-language text, departed the island. James Cameron <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>key</b> missionaries preferred to leave rather than remain on the island without authorization to proselytize. The last two remaining missionaries chose to continue teaching practical skills {{in the hope that}} the restrictions might loosen, but one year later, after receiving indirect information that the government desired their departure, they shuttered the LMS mission and left Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|Bridges <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>key</b> {{points were}} {{prepared}} for demolition at short notice by preparing chambers filled with explosives. A Depth Charge Crater was a site in a road (usually at a junction) prepared with buried explosives that could be detonated to instantly form a deep crater as an anti-tank obstacle. The Canadian pipe mine (later known as the McNaughton Tube after General Andrew McNaughton) was a horizontally bored pipe packed with explosives– once in place this {{could be used to}} instantly ruin a road or runway. Prepared demolitions had the advantage of being undetectable from the air—the enemy could not take any precautions against them, or plot a route of attack around them.|$|E
5|$|Fletcher's {{efforts to}} match the Oilers led him to draw talent from areas {{previously}} neglected by the NHL. The Flames were among the earliest teams to sign large numbers of US college players, including Joel Otto, Gary Suter, and Colin Patterson. Fletcher also stepped up the search for European hockey talent, acquiring Hakan Loob <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>key</b> players. He {{was among the first}} to draft players from the Soviet Union, including HC CSKA Moscow star Sergei Makarov in 1983, but Soviet players were not released to Western teams until 1989. Still, the team was sufficiently improved to challenge the Oilers, who required the maximum seven games to defeat the Flames en route to their 1984 Stanley Cup Championship.|$|E
5|$|In England, Stephen's reign {{started off}} well, with lavish gatherings {{of the royal}} court that saw the King give out grants of land and favours to his supporters. Stephen {{received}} the support of Pope Innocent II, {{thanks in part to}} the testimony of Louis VI and Theobald. Troubles rapidly began to emerge. Matilda's uncle, David I of Scotland, invaded the north of England on the news of Henry's death, taking Carlisle, Newcastle <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>key</b> strongholds. Stephen rapidly marched north with an army and met David at Durham, where a temporary compromise was agreed. South Wales rose in rebellion, and by 1137 Stephen was forced to abandon attempts to suppress the revolt. Stephen put down two revolts in the south-west led by Baldwin de Redvers and Robert of Bampton; Baldwin was released after his capture and travelled to Normandy, where he became a vocal critic of the King.|$|E

5|$|In {{its third}} weekend, Srimanthudu {{stood at the}} {{second place in the}} Indian films at the United States box office. It {{collected}} US$94,498 (6.257 million) from 46 screens. The United States box office total stood at US$2,820,214 (188 million), which was considered quite a remarkable achievement for a South Indian film. After losing 49% of screens due to new releases, Srimanthudu collected US$27,647 from 24 screens in its fourth weekend. The United States box office total stood at US$2,869,560 (190.7 million). By then, the film's screening had ended in Canada, the United Arab Emirates, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>key</b> international markets. Srimanthudu lost eighteen screens to Bhale Bhale Magadivoy and other new releases, thus witnessing a drop of 75% in its business. Collecting US$7,538 from six screens, the film's 31-day United States box office total stood at US$2,882,809 (192.6 million), with a per-screen average of US$1,256.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand is a {{constitutional}} monarchy with a parliamentary democracy, although its constitution is not codified. Elizabeth II is the Queen of New Zealand {{and the head}} of state.

The powers of the Queen and the Governor-General are limited by constitutional constraints and they cannot normally be exercised without the advice of ministers.|$|E
5|$|Stephen had to {{intervene}} in the north of England immediately after his coronation. David I of Scotland invaded the north on the news of Henry's death, taking Carlisle, Newcastle <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>key</b> strongholds. Northern England was a disputed territory at this time, with the Scottish kings laying a traditional claim to Cumberland, and David also claiming Northumbria by virtue of his marriage to the daughter of the former Anglo-Saxon earl Waltheof. Stephen rapidly marched north with an army and met David at Durham. An agreement was made under which David would return most of the territory he had taken, with the exception of Carlisle. In return, Stephen confirmed David's son Prince Henry's possessions in England, including the Earldom of Huntingdon.|$|E

5|$|In December 1943, Eisenhower was {{appointed}} Supreme Allied Commander for Operation Overlord, {{the invasion of}} Normandy. Eisenhower wished to take Smith <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>key</b> members of his AFHQ staff with him to his new assignment, but Prime Minister Winston Churchill wanted to retain Smith at AFHQ as Deputy Supreme Commander in the Mediterranean. Churchill reluctantly gave way at Eisenhower's insistence. On New Year's Eve, Smith met with General (one day later Field Marshal) Sir Alan Brooke to discuss the transfer of key British staff members from AFHQ to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF). Brooke released Gale only after a strong appeal from Smith, but refused to transfer Strong. A heated exchange resulted, and Brooke later complained to Eisenhower about Smith's behavior. This {{was the only time}} that a senior British officer ever complained openly about Smith. Whiteley became Chief of Intelligence (G-2) at SHAEF instead of Strong, but Eisenhower and Smith had their way in the long run, and Strong assumed the post on 25 May 1944, with Brigadier General Thomas J. Betts as his deputy.|$|E
