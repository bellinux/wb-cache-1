5|$|At {{the maiden}} voyage of the Springfield monorail, Lanley {{arranges}} for a well-attended opening ceremony, which will divert the town's attention while he escapes on <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> Tahiti. The whole town turns out, and Leonard Nimoy is {{the guest of}} honor. The monorail departs just before Marge and Cobb arrive. Although it runs normally at the start, the controls soon malfunction and immediately begins to over-speed around the track, leaving Homer, Bart, and the passengers in danger, as the monorail's electricity cannot be shut off due to it being solar powered.|$|E

Sitting together in a car, Owen mentions to Alex that she needs to maintain her cover so as to evade capture from domestic and international law enforcement agencies as a result of being issued an Interpol Red Notice for her arrest. Along with Ryan, she leaves the country on <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> an unknown international destination.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the changes}} made shortly after 9/11 was the colour scheme of the police cars; the {{original}} colour scheme of blue with white stripes specifically resembled that of the New York City Police Department. It was changed to black-and-white designs common among several police departments in the United States, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco. Other changes include altering the flight path of <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> avoid appearing to fly into or behind a skyscraper, removing a mission referencing terrorists, {{as well as some}} changes to pedestrian dialogue and talk radio.|$|E

At the last second, Walter notices an invisible wall preventing their escape and pushes the player out of the plane before dying in the subsequent crash.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the scale}} of the cyclone damage, the {{government}} issued an international appeal for assistance. As a result, the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs provided a grant of $30,000. UNICEF provided about $48,000 to secure drug kits for children impacted by the cyclone. The Red Cross of Seychelles donated about one tonne of clothing and 20tonnes of tuna, and the Red Cross of Réunion sent drugs to Madagascar. The government of France also sent a crew from Réunion to Madagascar to assist in the aftermath, as well as <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> airdrop the aid. The governments of Germany, Japan, France, the United Kingdom each donated about $100,000 to Madagascar, while the United States provided about $25,000 and 500tons of food. The government of Japan also sent 2,040blankets and 10tents. By February18, the total contributions by the international community reached about $3million.|$|E

5|$|His {{first study}} of {{mathematics}} began with papers by George Pólya {{and by the}} crystallographer Friedrich Haag on plane symmetry groups, sent {{to him by his}} brother Berend, a geologist. He carefully studied the 17 wallpaper groups, and created periodic tilings with 43 drawings of different types of symmetry. From this point on he developed a mathematical approach to expressions of symmetry in his art works using his own notation. Starting in 1937, he created woodcuts based on the 17 groups. His Metamorphosis I (1937) began a series of designs that told a story through the use of pictures. In Metamorphosis I, he transformed convex polygons into regular patterns in <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> form a human motif. He extended the approach in his piece Metamorphosis III, which is four metres long.|$|E
5|$|In February 1988, plainclothes police {{officers}} forced Arias Calderón {{and his wife}} onto <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> Costa Rica at gunpoint, and the couple spent a month in exile in Miami. Arias returned to Panama in March, calling openly for Noriega's ouster on arrival at the Omar Torrijos International Airport. In Panama's May 1989 elections, Arias stood {{as a candidate for}} First Vice President with the ADOC, with Guillermo Endara as the presidential candidate and Guillermo Ford as the candidate for Second Vice President. However, Noriega's government annulled the election before voting was complete. Days after the completion of voting, Endara, Arias, and Ford were attacked on camera by Noriega supporters while security forces observed and refused to intervene. In October of that year, Arias was briefly arrested for urging citizens not to pay taxes to his government.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of a match, a 30-second headstart is given to the Monster so that they can have enough time to escape before the Hunters parachute from <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> where the Monster started. Each map features an open world environment for players to explore and play within. To help the Hunters navigate the environments quickly, they are equipped with jetpacks, allowing them to jump over obstacles and cliffs. The jetpack {{can also be used to}} dodge attacks performed by the monster, though it consumes a Hunter's energy. The team can track the monster, as well as place waypoints on an interactive map. The color of these waypoints are different based on what players have marked. The waypoint mark turns yellow for environment, orange for wildlife or red for the Monster.|$|E

Liam says to Charlie that he, Liam, is Drive Shaft, and that nobody knows who the bass player (Charlie) is. He goes on to tell Charlie that without the band, Charlie is nothing, which spurs Charlie to use heroin for the first time. Years later, Charlie visits Liam's house in Australia and wants Liam to rejoin Drive Shaft for a {{comeback}} tour. Liam declines, but the band can't do the tour without him. He criticizes Charlie for still using drugs, and Charlie blames Liam for getting him started with drugs. Liam asks Charlie {{to stay with him}} for a few weeks, saying that Sydney has some good rehab programs and that he can get Charlie help. Charlie angrily leaves, saying he has <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> catch.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill for}} the plane {{remained}} unpaid. In 1914 Vickers reminded Mawson, who had apparently forgotten the outstanding debt. Mawson wrote to Vickers director Sir Trevor Dawson in November 1916, requesting the company write off the bill as a donation. His company buoyed by armaments contracts, Dawson agreed. The next expedition to take <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> the Antarctic was Shackleton's 1921–22 Quest Expedition, but the Avro Baby remained grounded owing to missing parts. Not until 16November 1928—when Hubert Wilkins and Carl Ben Eielson flew for 20minutes around Deception Island, {{just over a year}} before Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd's first flight over the South Pole—was a plane airborne in the Antarctic.|$|E
5|$|During Shepherd's surgery, {{his hand}} becomes numb, and he frustratedly exits the {{operating}} room. In the intern appendectomy, Wilson {{makes a mistake}} and freezes, leading to a scolding from Meredith Grey. Back in Minnesota, Yang is annoyed by the peppy attitudes of her superiors at Mayo Clinic, Dr. Craig Thomas (William Daniels) and Dr. Parker (Steven Culp), so she decides to take a trip to Seattle for Sloan's death. However, her PTSD hinders her from boarding the plane, and she ultimately remains in Minnesota. Meanwhile, Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), now a plastic surgical fellow, sits by Sloan's bedside and talks of medical cases to him. Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) enters Sloan's hospital room and removes him from life support. Unable to cope with Sloan's death, Meredith Grey boards <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> visit Yang, but panics before it takes off. Shortly thereafter, Meredith Grey finds Karev at the airport bar, where he reveals {{that he will be}} staying at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital. The next morning, Hunt visits Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) at her family's farm, and asks her to begin working in Seattle again. At the conclusion of the episode, Torres returns home to Robbins, who is revealed to have had her lower left leg amputated {{as a result of the}} crash.|$|E

5|$|En {{route to}} the Sea of Monsters (Bermuda triangle), the Birmingham is {{destroyed}} by Charybdis and Scylla. Thinking Tyson and Clarisse dead, Percy and Annabeth sail in a lifeboat to a nearby island, where they narrowly escape the sorceress Circe, who turns men into guinea pigs. They steal the Queen Anne's Revenge from Circe's harbor and sail towards the island of Polyphemus. Along the way, they pass the island of the Sirens and Annabeth confesses her fatal flaw, hubris, to Percy. When they reach the island, they find Grover, Clarisse, Tyson, and the fleece. Tyson and Percy work together to defeat Polyphemus and return the group to the mainland. Once there, Clarisse takes <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> Camp Half-Blood with the Fleece. The remaining questers are captured by Luke and taken to the Princess Andromeda. Percy manages to contact Camp Half-Blood through an Iris Message and tricks Luke into admitting that he poisoned Thalia's tree, proving Chiron's innocence {{in front of the}} entire camp. Mr. D then sends Tantalus back to the Fields of Punishment. Luke duels Percy, beats him, and is about to kill the group, but before he does, Chiron and the his centaur relatives appear and rescue them. Returning to the camp, Chiron is given his job back and the Golden Fleece heals Thalia's tree. However, in the final pages, the Golden Fleece also revives Thalia Grace, putting another half-blood back into play for the Great Prophecy the gods fear so much.|$|E
5|$|Mulder visits Max's trailer {{again and}} looks through his mail, finding a luggage claim ticket. Scully visits Sharon, {{now in a}} mental institution, who tells Scully that she stole {{technology}} from her employer that Max believed was alien. The device was in three parts, one which she had, one that he brought {{on the plane and}} a third one. Mulder uses the claim ticket to obtain the third device at a New York airport and heads on <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> return to Washington. Garrett, who is also aboard, sits next to him. Mulder soon realizes who Garrett is and holds him at gunpoint. Garrett does not care, telling Mulder that if he shoots him the plane will depressurize and {{he will be able to}} escape with a parachute he has with him. Mulder imprisons Garrett in the airplane bathroom but Garrett soon emerges with a zip gun and orders him to hand over the device. Suddenly the plane starts shaking and bright lights shine in through the windows. When the plane touches down and Mulder gets out both Garrett and the device are gone and Mulder is missing nine minutes, having no memory of what happened. The agents visit Sharon one last time in Max's trailer and say goodbye.|$|E
5|$|On April 4, 1968, African-American {{civil rights}} leader Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated by a sniper in Memphis, Tennessee. United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy was {{traveling}} to Indianapolis to promote his presidential campaign {{when he heard the}} news. He delivered a brief, improvised speech on the matter before suspending all of his campaign activities and withdrawing to his room at the Marott Hotel. After several phone conversations with black community leaders, he decided to speak out against the violent backlash to the assassination and carry on with a scheduled appearance before the City Club of Cleveland. His aides concurred that this was the best course of action, and agreed that he should shortly thereafter go to Washington D.C. and remain there until King could be buried. Kennedy also spoke over the phone with Coretta Scott King, King's widow, in Atlanta. At her request, Kennedy directed aide Frank Mankiewicz to arrange for <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> retrieve King's body. Since most air carriers were wary of taking up such a task, a plane was chartered from one of Kennedy's friends. John Lewis and Earl Graves, among others, were dispatched to assist Coretta Scott King. Kennedy also had three additional phone lines installed at the King residence to handle the influx of incoming calls while his staff established a phone bank at West Hunter Baptist Church in Atlanta for the King family's use.|$|E

Soderbergh does not use type-cast pharmaceutical executives or politicians as villains, but instead portrays bloggers such as Krumwiede in a negative light. Social media {{plays a role in}} Krumwiede's accusations against Dr. Cheever and in Emhoff's daughter's attempts to carry on a relationship with her boyfriend through text messaging. Other responses in the movie, such as Emhoff's appropriating a shotgun from a friend's abandoned house to protect his home from looters, imposition of federal quarantines and curfews, the allocation of vaccines by lottery, inadequate federal preparation and responses, and use of bar-coded wristbands to identify the inoculated highlight the complex tensions between freedom and order in responding to a pandemic. Soderbergh uses Emhoff to illustrate the micro-effects of macro-level decisions.|$|E
5|$|While coach McGuire and Rosenbluth boarded <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> New York {{to appear}} on The Ed Sullivan Show, {{the rest of the}} Tar Heels {{returned}} to North Carolina two days later when they landed at Raleigh–Durham International Airport (RDU). The North Carolina squad was greeted by over 10,000 fans. Some players were carried by members of the crowd from the airport ramp to the terminal. The airport manager believed the crowd gathered to meet the Tar Heels was the biggest in RDU's history. The crowd was so big that it prevented Chancellor Robert House from giving a planned speech for the team. The large crowd at the airport was credited to the airing of both the national semifinal and National Championship game on television around North Carolina. The 1957 North Carolina team were awarded watches for their victory in the national championship. In the 1990s, the team was given rings to commemorate their win in the national championship game after then North Carolina coach Dean Smith insisted upon giving the team rings. Coach McGuire was given a brand new Carolina blue and white Cadillac by the university, as well as being signed to a new fiveyear contract that gave him $11,500 per year.|$|E
