5|$|C.maenas has {{the ability}} to {{disperse}} by a variety of mechanisms, including ballast water, ships' hulls, packing materials (seaweeds) used to ship live marine organisms, bivalves moved for aquaculture, rafting, migration of crab larvae on ocean currents, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> submerged aquatic vegetation for coastal zone management initiatives. Thresher et al. found C.maenas dispersed in Australia mainly by rare long-distance events, possibly caused by human actions.|$|E
5|$|Civilian {{telephones}} {{were used}} {{at the outset of}} the war, but they were found to be unreliable in the damp, muddy conditions that prevailed. Consequently, the field telephone was designed; a device that operated with its own switchboard. Apart from voice communication, it featured a buzzer unit with a Morse code key, so that it could be used to send and receive coded messages. This facility proved useful when, in the midst of bombardment, exploding shells drowned out voice communication. The telephones were connected by lines that sustained continual damage as a result of shell fire <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> troops. The lines were generally buried, with redundant lines set in place to compensate for breakages.|$|E

They are mostly {{located in the}} artificial loess hills of Zemun: Gardoš, Ćukovac and Kalvarija. However, {{the majority of the}} land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst pipes, etc.). The neighborhood of Mirijevo is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighborhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> the land is today completely halted.|$|E

5|$|The Lesser Sunda Islands {{is a small}} {{archipelago}} which, {{from west}} to east, consists of Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores, Sumba and the Timor islands; all are located {{at the edge of}} the Australian continental shelf. Volcanoes in the area are formed because of oceanic crusts <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> the shelf itself. Some volcanoes completely form an island, for instance, the Sangeang Api island. Mount Tambora, on Sumbawa island, erupted on 5 April 1815, with a scale 7 on the VEI and is considered the most violent eruption in recorded history.|$|E

5|$|Gross {{movement}} – such as locomotion <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> {{arms and}} legs – is generated in the motor cortex, divided into three parts: the primary motor cortex, found in the prefrontal gyrus and has sections dedicated to the movement of different body parts. These movements are supported and regulated by two other areas, lying anterior to the primary motor cortex: the premotor area and the supplementary motor area. The hands and mouth have a much larger area dedicated to them than other body parts, allowing finer movement; this has been visualised in a motor cortical homunculus. Impulses generated from the motor cortex travel along the corticospinal tract along {{the front of the}} medulla and cross over (decussate) at the medullary pyramids. These then travel down the spinal cord, with most connecting to interneurons, in turn connecting to lower motor neurons within the grey matter that then transmit the impulse to move to muscles themselves. The cerebellum and basal ganglia, play a role in fine, complex and coordinated muscle movements. Connections between the cortex and the basal ganglia control muscle tone, posture and movement initiation, and are referred to as the extrapyramidal system.|$|E
