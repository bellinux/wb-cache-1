25|$|A ban on absinthe {{was enacted}} in Germany on 27 March 1923. In {{addition}} to banning {{the production of}} and commercial trade in absinthe, the law {{went so far as}} to prohibit the distribution of printed matter that provided details of its production. The original ban was lifted in 1981, but the use of Artemisia <b>absinthium</b> as a flavouring agent remained prohibited. On 27 September 1991, Germany adopted the European Union's standards of 1988, which effectively re-legalised absinthe. Unlike Switzerland and France, there are no further restrictions.|$|E
500|$|Studies on the non-vascular flora {{recorded}} {{the presence of}} about 150 moss species {{in the area of}} the national park, including one newly described taxon. Many herbs of the Vikos Gorge and other areas within the park were regarded to have medicinal properties and were once harvested by local healers, colloquially referred to as [...] "Vikos doctors" [...] ( [...] , [...] "Vikoiatri"). These herbal healers used special recipes that were often copies of ancient Greek recipes of Hippocrates or Dioscorides and became famous beyond the borders of Greece. The plants used in these recipes include the lemon balm Melissa officinalis, Tilia tomentosa, the spearmint Mentha spicata, the gas-plant Dictamnus albus, St John’s Wort Hypericum perforatum, [...] absinth Artemisia <b>absinthium,</b> the very popular Sideritis raeseri, known colloquially in Greece as “mountain tea”, and the elder bush Sambucus nigra. A chemical screening of these native plant species has shown that a high number of them are characterized by biologically active ingredients. A collection of 2,500 dried species of local plants and herbs is exhibited in the local natural history museum in the village of Koukouli.|$|E
2500|$|The French word absinthe {{can refer}} {{either to the}} {{alcoholic}} beverage or, less commonly, to the actual wormwood plant, with grande absinthe being Artemisia <b>absinthium,</b> and petite absinthe being Artemisia pontica. The Latin name artemisia comes from Artemis, the ancient Greek goddess of the hunt. Absinthe {{is derived from the}} Latin <b>absinthium,</b> which in turn comes from the ancient Greek ἀψίνθιον apsínthion, [...] "wormwood". The use of Artemisia <b>absinthium</b> in a drink is attested in Lucretius' De Rerum Natura (I 936–950), where Lucretius indicates that a drink containing wormwood is given as medicine to children in a cup with honey on the brim to make it drinkable.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 2000, {{a product}} called Absente was sold legally in the United States under the {{marketing}} tagline [...] "Absinthe Refined," [...] {{but as the}} product contained sugar, and was made with southernwood (Artemisia abrotanum) and not grande wormwood (Artemisia <b>absinthium)</b> (prior to 2009), the TTB classified it as a liqueur.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} Bible {{scholars}} consider the term Wormwood to be a purely symbolic {{representation of the}} bitterness that will fill the earth during troubled times, noting that the plant for which Wormwood is named, Artemisia <b>absinthium,</b> or Mugwort, Artemisia vulgaris, is a known Biblical metaphor for things that are unpalatably bitter. The Ukrainian language word for [...] "wormwood" [...] is чорнобиль or [...] "chornobyl", the Ukrainian name {{of the town of}} Chernobyl.|$|E
2500|$|In the [...] Settore Sperimentale e delle Piante Utili [...] (Experimental {{zone and}} zone of {{practical}} plantings) plants which produce foodstuffs are exhibited, such as sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) and (Sorghum saccharatum), both {{used for the}} production of sugar; avocado (Persea americana), [...] various cultivars of banana (Musa acuminata × balbisiana), pecan nut, not to mention an extensive collection of vegetable plants with over 100 cultivars of great historical interest and hugely important in terms of the conservation of a local gene pool. Lastly we have the medicinal plantings, including Artemisia <b>absinthium,</b> [...] Datura stramonium, ginseng (Withania somnifera), la camphour (Cinnamomum canphora) and the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum).|$|E
2500|$|Absinthe ( [...] or French: [...] ) is {{historically}} {{described as a}} distilled, highly alcoholic (45–74% ABV / 90–148 U.S. proof) beverage. It is an anise-flavoured spirit derived from botanicals, including the flowers and leaves of Artemisia <b>absinthium</b> ("grand wormwood"), together with green anise, sweet fennel, and other medicinal and culinary herbs. Absinthe traditionally has a natural green colour but may also be colourless. It is commonly referred to in historical literature as [...] "" [...] (the green fairy). Although it is sometimes mistakenly {{referred to as a}} liqueur, absinthe is not traditionally bottled with added sugar; it is therefore classified as a spirit. Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water prior to being consumed.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{claim that}} the word means [...] "undrinkable" [...] in Greek, but it may instead {{be linked to the}} Persian root spand or aspand, or the variant esfand, which meant Peganum harmala, also called Syrian Rue—although it is not {{actually}} a variety of rue, another famously bitter herb. That Artemisia <b>absinthium</b> was commonly burned as a protective offering may suggest that its origins lie in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European root *spend, meaning [...] "to perform a ritual" [...] or [...] "make an offering". Whether the word was a borrowing from Persian into Greek, or from a common ancestor of both, is unclear. Alternatively, the Greek word may originate in a pre-Greek substrate Pelasgian word, marked by the non-Indo-European consonant complex νθ (-nth).|$|E

60|$|The {{scattered}} growths {{were composed}} of the broomy Codeso and Retama. The former (Adenocarpus frankenoides), a leguminous plant, showed only dense light-green leaves without flower, and consequently without their heavy, cloying perfume. The woody stem acts in these regions as the doornboom of South Africa, the wild sage of the western prairies, and the shih (<b>absinthium)</b> of the Arabian desert. The Arabic Retama, or Alpine broom (Cytisus fragrans, Lam.; Cyt. nubigenus, Decan.; Spartium nubigenum, Alton and Von Buch), {{is said to be}} peculiar to Tenerife, where it is not found under one vertical mile of height. Some travellers divide it into two species, Spartium monospermum and S. nubigenum. The bush, 9 to 10 feet tall by 7 to 15 inches diameter, is easily distinguished from the Codeso by its denser and deeper green. This pretty rounded growth, with its short brown stem throwing out lateral branches which trail on the ground, flavours meat, and might be naturalised in Europe. From June till August it is covered with a profusion of white blossoms, making Las Canadas a Hymettus, an apiarian heaven. It extends as far as the second cone, but there it shrinks to a foot in height. We did not see the tree growing, but we met a party of Chasna men, [Footnote: A romantic tale is told of the origin of Chasna. In 1496, before the wars ended, one Pedro de Bracamonte, a captain under De Lugo, captured a 'belle sauvage,' who made her escape after a few days. He went about continually repeating, 'Vi la flor del valle' (I saw the valley flower), and died after three months. His soldiers buried him and priests said masses for the soul of this 'hot amorist.'] driving asses like onagers, laden with the gummy wood of the Tea or Tiya pine (P. canariensis). The valuable material, which resists damp and decay for centuries, and which Decandolle declares would grow in Scotland, is rapidly disappearing from the Pinals. The travellers carried cochineal-seed, for which their village is famous, and a hive which might have been Abyssinian. It was a hollow cylinder of palm-bole, closed with board at either end; in July and August it is carried up the mountain, where the bees cannot destroy the grapes. We searched in vain for M. Broussonet's white violet (V. teydensis), [Footnote: Humboldt's five zones of vegetation on the Pike are vines, laurels, pines, broom, and grasses (p. 116). Mr. Addison modifies this scale to vines, laurels, pines and junipers, mountain-brooms and pumice-plains, I should distribute the heights as growing cochineal, potatoes, and cereals, chestnuts, pines, heaths, grasses, and bare rock.] and for the lilac-coloured Viola cheiranthifolia, akin to V. decumbens.|$|E
