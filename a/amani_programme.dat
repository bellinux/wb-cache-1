[...] "To proceed in this way is to incite us to quit the <b>Amani</b> <b>programme,</b> the government should not forget this", claimed Mai-Mai leaders. [...] "We are not a negligible group, we have arms... We want the CNDP to rejoin Amani. It seems that by quitting Amani, they have become more important than the other groups. We don't understand the decision by the government to go and negotiate with the CNDP... We are disappointed, it's a flagrant violation of Amani's terms." [...] CNDP spokesman Bertrand Bisimwa stated that the rebels [...] "are going to Nairobi to discuss only with the government outside of the <b>Amani</b> <b>programme...</b> If the government insists on staying in Amani, we'll pack our bags." [...] CNDP representatives, led by deputy executive secretary Serge Kambasu Ngeve, had arrived in the Kenyan capital city of Nairobi believing that they would be participating in bilateral discussions with the Congolese government alone. The government representatives, led by Congolese Minister for International and Regional Cooperation Raymond Tshibanda, did not express concern, with Information Minister Lambert Mende claiming that if the CNDP wanted to walk out [...] "that's their problem not ours. It's their problem if they don't want peace. They'll be held accountable for their acts." [...] Meanwhile, Alan Le Roy, Under-Secretary General for Peacekeeping Operations, pressed for more action to be taken to intervene in the situation.|$|E
