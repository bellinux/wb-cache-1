25|$|Hashtags (#topic) and user tags (@username) {{make use}} of {{metadata}} in order to track “trending” topics and to alert users of their name’s use within a post on a social media site. Used by various social media websites (most notably Twitter and Facebook), these features add internal linkage between users and themes. Characteristics of a multimodal feature can be seen through the status update option on Facebook. Status updates combine the affordances of personal blogs, Twitter, instant messaging, and texting in a single feature. The 2013 status update button currently prompts a user, “What’s on your mind?” a change from the 2007, “What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> right now?” This change was added by Facebook to promote greater flexibility for the user. This multimodal feature allows a user to add text, video, image, links, and tag other users. Twitter's 140 character in a single message microblogging platform allows users the ability to link to other users, websites, and attach pictures. This new media is a platform that is affecting the literacy practice of the current generation by condensing the conversational context of the internet into fewer characters but encapsulating several media.|$|E

500|$|Trying {{to unravel}} {{the mystery of the}} song, Greil Marcus writes that the song is {{concerned}} with internal questions, rather than external ones: [...] "Line by line, 'Blowin' in the Wind' is pious, or falsely innocent—isn't it obvious that whoever wrote [...] "Yes, 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail / Before she sleeps in the sand?" [...] already knows the answer, assuming he, or anyone, can actually bring themselves to care about such a precious question? But 'Visions of Johanna' is asking different sorts of questions.

[...] Evoking the drugged, urban milieu of the song, Marcus writes of [...] "People wandering from one corner of a loft to another, doped, drunk, half-awake, fast asleep, no point to the next breath, let alone the next step."

[...] "I've Never Been a Woman Before" [...] is song written by Tom Baird and Ron Miller for Cherry, an unproduced musical based on the William Inge play Bus Stop. The closing song on the record is a medley of [...] "My Buddy" [...] and [...] "How About Me", from Gus Kahn, Walter Donaldson, and Irving Berlin.
