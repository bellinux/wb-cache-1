Using the PIP marker, pilots can achieve good accuracy at ranges of up to several kilometers, whether the target is ground-based or airborne.

Both linear and angular compensations are done by tilting the mirror mounted on the folding optics.|$|E
50|$|In flight an {{aircraft}} {{can be considered}} as being acted on by four forces: lift, weight, thrust, and drag. Thrust is the force generated by the engine (whether it be a jet or a propeller driven craft) and acts along the engine's thrust vector for the purpose of overcoming drag. Lift acts perpendicular to the vector representing the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>velocity</b> relative to the atmosphere. Drag acts parallel to the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>velocity</b> vector, but in the opposite direction because drag resists motion through the air. Weight acts through the aircraft's centre of gravity, towards the center of the Earth.|$|R

50|$|In {{aircraft}} flight dynamics, post stall is {{a flight}} {{condition in which}} the <b>aircraft</b> <b>velocity</b> has become lower than stall speed, in order to overcome stalling in the aircraft. In this state —below the low-velocity limit of the flight domain— the wings no longer provide enough lift to compensate the aircraft weight. Some aircraft, such as fighter jets, have enough engine thrust to maintain flight at those speeds. Normal flight controls, such as ailerons and elevators, may then no longer be sufficient to maintain full control of the aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The way {{the steam}} {{catapult}} works is at launch, a release bar holds the aircraft {{in place as}} steam pressure builds up, then breaks (or [...] "releases"; older models used a pin that sheared), freeing the piston to pull the aircraft along the deck at high speed. Within about two to four seconds, <b>aircraft</b> <b>velocity</b> {{by the action of}} the catapult plus apparent wind speed (ship's speed plus or minus [...] "natural" [...] wind) is sufficient to allow an aircraft to fly away, even after losing one engine.|$|E

50|$|To {{transform}} {{from the}} wind frame to the body frame, the two Euler angles are the angle of attack α and the sideslip angle β. When performing the rotations described earlier to obtain the body frame {{from the wind}} frame, (α,β) are analogous to (θ,ψ), respectively; the angle analogous to φ in this transformation is always zero. The sideslip angle β is the angle between the velocity vector and the projection of the aircraft longitudinal axis onto the xw,yw-plane, which describes {{whether there is a}} lateral component to the <b>aircraft</b> <b>velocity,</b> also known as sideslip. The angle of attack α is the angle between the xw,yw-plane and the aircraft longitudinal axis and, among other things, is an important variable in determining the magnitude of the force of lift.|$|E
50|$|Propellers {{are similar}} in {{aerofoil}} section to a low-drag wing and as such are poor in operation when at other than their optimum angle of attack. Therefore, some propellers use a variable pitch mechanism to alter the blades' pitch angle as engine speed and <b>aircraft</b> <b>velocity</b> are changed.A further consideration is the number and {{the shape of the}} blades used. Increasing the aspect ratio of the blades reduces drag but the amount of thrust produced depends on blade area, so using high-aspect blades can result in an excessive propeller diameter. A further balance is that using a smaller number of blades reduces interference effects between the blades, but to have sufficient blade area to transmit the available power within a set diameter means a compromise is needed. Increasing the number of blades also decreases the amount of work each blade is required to perform, limiting the local Mach number - a significant performance limit on propellers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{antenna beam}} becomes wider as the {{aircraft}} gets farther away, making the position information less accurate. Additionally, detecting changes in <b>aircraft</b> <b>velocity</b> requires several radar sweeps that are spaced several seconds apart. In contrast, a system using ADS-B creates and listens for periodic position and intent reports from aircraft. These reports are generated {{based on the}} aircraft's navigation system, and distributed via {{one or more of}} the ADS-B data links. The accuracy of the data is no longer susceptible to the position of the aircraft or the length of time between radar sweeps. (However, the signal strength of the signal received from the aircraft at the ground station is still dependent on the range from the aircraft to the receiver, and interference, obstacles, or weather could degrade the integrity of the received signal enough to prevent the digital data from being decoded without errors; when the aircraft is farther away, the weaker received signal will tend to be more affected by the aforementioned adverse factors and is less likely to be received without errors in their presence. While error detection codes will allow the errors to be recognized as errors, so that the system maintains full accuracy regardless of aircraft position when the signal can be received and decoded correctly, this advantage does not equate to total indifference to the range of an aircraft from the ground station.) ...|$|E
50|$|When {{released}} from an aircraft, a bomb {{carries with it}} the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>velocity.</b> In {{the case of a}} bomber flying horizontally, the bomb will initially only be travelling forward. This forward motion is opposed by the drag of the air, so the forward motion decreases over time. Additionally, gravity accelerates the bomb downward. The combination of these two forces, drag and gravity, results in a complex pseudo-parabolic trajectory.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an image motion model for airborne three-line-array (TLA) push-broom cameras. Both <b>aircraft</b> <b>velocity</b> and attitude instability {{are taken into}} account in modeling image motion. Effects of aircraft pitch, roll, and yaw on image motion are analyzed based on geometric relations in designated coordinate systems. The image motion is mathematically modeled by image motion velocity multiplied by exposure time. Quantitative analysis to image motion velocity is then conducted in simulation experiments. The results have shown that image motion caused by <b>aircraft</b> <b>velocity</b> is space invariant while image motion caused by aircraft attitude instability is more complicated. Pitch,roll and yaw all contribute to image motion to different extents. Pitch dominates the along-track image motion and both roll and yaw greatly contribute to the cross-track image motion.

In the case of the direct effects on the bomb, a measurement that has a 5% error, 1.25 mph, that would cause a 5% error in the drift, which would be 17.5 feet. However, that 1.25 mph error, or 1.8 fps, would also be added to the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>velocity.</b> Over the time of the fall, 37 seconds, that would result in an error of 68 feet, which is at the outside limit of the bomb's performance.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. This thesis investigates {{aggressive}} all-attitude {{flight control}} systems. These are flight controllers capable of controlling an aircraft at any attitude and {{will enable the}} autonomous execution of manoeuvres such as high bank angle turns, steep climbs and aerobatic flight manoeuvres. This class of autopilot {{could be applied to}} carry out evasive combat manoeuvres or to create more efficient and realistic target drones. A model for the aircraft’s dynamics is developed {{in such a way that}} its high bandwidth specific force and moment model is split from its lower bandwidth kinematic model. This split is done at the aircraft’s specific acceleration and roll rate, which enables the design of simple, decoupled, linear attitude independent inner loop controllers to regulate these states. Two outer loop kinematic controllers are then designed to interface with these inner loop controllers to guide the aircraft through predefined reference trajectories. The first method involves the design of a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) based on the successively linearised kinematics, to optimally control the system. The second method involves specific acceleration matching (SAM) and results in a linear guidance controller that makes use of position based trajectories. These position based trajectories allow the <b>aircraft’s</b> <b>velocity</b> magnitude to be regulated independently of the trajectory tracking. To this end, two velocity regulation algorithms were developed. These involved methods of optimal control, implemented using dynamic programming, and energy analysis to regulate the <b>aircraft’s</b> <b>velocity</b> in a predictive manner and thereby providing significantly improved velocity regulation during aggressive aerobatic type manoeuvres.

40|$|This paper {{predicts the}} risk of near midair {{collisions}} between airborne aircraft {{as a function of}} the type of controlled terminal airspace in which they occur, <b>aircraft</b> <b>velocities,</b> the geometries of approach patterns, and the number of flight operations which arise, end in or traverse these areas. Based on an analysis of near midair collision risk, the paper concludes that air carrier operations by themselves are safer than general aviation operations by themselves in radar-controlled environments such as a Terminal Control Area, but that general aviation operations by themselves are safer in less-controlled than in more-controlled airspace. By far the most risky flight appears to be general aviation aircraft interacting with other general aviation aircraft in positively-controlled environments such as a Terminal Control Area. We offer a model which describes the factors that influence near midair collisions and some reasons for a possible explanation of these surprising results. ...|$|R
