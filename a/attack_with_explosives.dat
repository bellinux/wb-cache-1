3000|$|After the {{occurrence}} of a disaster, it is natural to ask, who is responsible. In many cases, {{people are trying to}} find one person or organization (the ‘scapegoat’) to blame. In fact, after the Love Parade disaster, it seems that everybody was blaming everybody else: the visitors, the organizers, the police, the city of Duisburg. What makes things difficult is that nobody is totally right and nobody is totally wrong: in the following, we will argue that it is the interaction of many contributing factors that caused the crowd disaster. Before we discuss the interaction of these factors, however, let us shed more light on some of them in separation. While doing so, we will address a number of hypotheses regarding the cause of the crowd disaster, which have been formulated after the event. Given the many victims and pictures reminding of a war zone, some people first thought that a terrorist <b>attack</b> <b>with</b> <b>explosives</b> had happened. 118 Others claimed that the fatalities resulted, because some people had fallen on top of others when unsuccessfully trying to climb the stairs from the side or the billboard (see Figure 1). 119 And again others were blaming the crowd for the outbreak of a ‘mass panic’ (stampede) 120 or at least some people for improper behavior. 121 The first hypothesis was obviously not true. But what about the others? [...]...|$|E
40|$|After {{completion}} of the NATO aggression on Yugoslavia started much suffering of the Serbian and other minority communities in Kosovo and Metohija. Members of the Albanian paramilitary formations were escorted planning organized violence and terror, and for ethnic cleansing and destruction of the Serbian people in this region. The agreement that was signed between KFOR and the so-called KLA 'The agreement K + 90 ' enabled the KLA carried out violence and terror against minority populations. One of the crimes {{that have taken place}} after the so-called the demilitarization of the KLA was an <b>attack</b> <b>with</b> <b>explosives</b> on the Serbian market in the village Bresje 28 September 1999. The crime was ethnically motivated to intimidate, pressure and the like oppression and ethnic cleansing of the Serbian population in Kosovo and Metohija. On the Serbian market in the village Bresje, where there were several hundred civilians were fired two grenades. This crime has produced three deaths and several dozen persons were injured. KFOR soon arrived at the scene and the injured persons drove in the Russian hospital in Kosovo Polje. The attack is the intention of the Albanian paramilitaries to kill large numbers of civilians of Serbian nationality, which would produce feelings of fear, anxiety, insecurity and inequality, and led to the displacement {{of a large number of}} people. When it comes to Serbian victims in Kosovo and Metohija justice remains blind, and so for this crime no one has been prosecuted. For the investigation of the crime was in charge of UNMIK police, with the assistance of KFOR. Immediately after the shelling of the market, were arrested two ethnic Albanians who were suspected of a crime, but were soon freed from detention. It is interesting also that this crime had expected, because the earlier sent anonymous reports of a possible attack, but that KFOR and UNMIK have failed to prevent his execution. Fear that appeared among the Serbian population in Bresje led to barricades. After the attack, the Italian KFOR troops are responsible for security of the Serbian population in Kosovo Polje, because the Serbs no longer had confidence in British KFOR troops. One of the reasons for shelling the market place was also intended to prevent the creation of a large Serbian enclave in Kosovo Polje and the surrounding area and that the Serb population from such a region displace. Consequences of shelling the market place are numerous: loss of 3 lives, wounding about 40 people, to cancel the agreement on the integration of Serbian and Albanian municipal authorities in Kosovo Polje, a sense of fear, inequality, insecurity and anxiety among the Serbian population, but also better protection of the Serbian population in Kosovo Polje and the environment...|$|E

The new thing from the structural engineer´s point of view is that not only the direct effects due to an explosion will be calculated but also the consequences of a possible progressive collapse initiated by the explosion. The findings of the research work are twofold. Firstly, urban planners will be qualified to design safer urban areas.

50|$|The subject {{became very}} {{controversial}} during the politically agitated Spanish Transition {{in what was}} to become the Valencian Community, especially in and around the city of Valencia. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, when the Spanish Autonomous Communities system was taking shape, the controversy reached its height. Various Valencian right-wing politicians (originally from Unión de Centro Democrático) fearing what was seen as an annexation attempt from Catalonia, fueled a violent Anti-Catalanist campaign against local supporters of the concept of the Països Catalans, which even included a handful of unsuccessful <b>attacks</b> <b>with</b> <b>explosives</b> against authors perceived as flagships of the concept, such as Joan Fuster or Manuel Sanchis i Guarner. The concept's revival during this period was behind the formation of the fiercely opposed and staunch anti-Catalan blaverist movement, led by Unió Valenciana, which, in turn, significantly diminished during the 1990s and the 2000s as the Països Catalans controversy slowly disappeared from the Valencian political arena.|$|R

40|$|According to {{existing}} design standards, explosive loading represents a special type of loading. Explosive loading is, in most cases, local in nature, {{although it can}} exceed the loads for which buildings are designed by a dozen of times. The analysis of terrorist <b>attacks</b> <b>with</b> <b>explosives</b> employed demonstrates that charges have a great power and, consequently, a substantial shock wave pressure. Blast effects are predictable with a certain probability. Therefore, we cannot discuss the no-failure operation of individual structures. The estimated reliability of buildings is a more important problem. That's how we can save lives {{of those people who}} are outside of the area impacted by an explosion. Explosive loading is a variable random process influenced by a variety of factors, including the charge geometry, weight, etc. A shock wave can be reflected from surfaces and objects. Reference data concerning physical properties of models of explosives are provided in various sources. That's why we can talk about the blast load value with some probability. The article deals with the probability modeling of the shock wave pressure. The charge weight is chosen as a random parameter that has a normal Gauss distribution. Any structural design must be backed by reliable and verified calculations and mathematical models based on advanced high-speed PCs and software. The finite element software package ANSYS/LS-DYNA was employed to complete this research. The problem was solved in the time domain through the employment of the fourth integration of equations of motion. We can assess the reliability of structures and buildings if we know the parameters of random explosive effects. Numerical simulation helps identify random explosive impacts. This problem is relevant in connection with the construction of unique high-rise buildings and extensive sports facilities that accommodate dozens of thousands of viewers.

A prominent debate has emerged among scholars and practitioners {{about the importance of}} winning civilian “hearts and minds” for influencing their wartime behavior. We argue that such efforts may have a dark side: insurgents can use pro-counterinsurgent attitudes as cues to select their targets and tactics. We conduct an original survey experiment in 204 Afghan villages to establish a positive association between pro-International Security Assistance Force attitudes and future Taliban attacks. We then extend our analysis to 14, 606 non-surveyed villages to demonstrate that our measure of civilian attitudes improves out-of-sample predictive performance by 20 – 30 % over a standard forecasting model. The results are especially strong for Taliban <b>attacks</b> <b>with</b> improvised <b>explosive</b> devices. These improvements in predictive power remain even after accounting for possible confounders, including past violence, military bases, and economic assistance...|$|R

30|$|Both above crime scripts {{highlight}} {{the need for}} finding a suitable site. A standoff that creates distance between an accessible spot and the target decreases the effect from the explosion upon the intended target and thus reduces the benefit of attacking. Crime participants seek, however, to overcome the defences of their adversaries (Felson 2006). Instead of just accepting the reduced benefit of attacking, the attacker might thus adapt; whether abandoning the attack entirely, attacking another target (target substitution), or choosing a different attack mode (Meyer 2013). A standoff would, for example, protect against vehicle-borne explosives, while {{not being able to}} prevent any <b>attack</b> <b>with</b> a person-borne <b>explosive.</b>|$|R
