5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} {{production}} possibilities curve or {{to the left of}} it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points that lie {{to the right of the}} production possibilities curve <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly to the left of the curve <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E

5|$|Apotropaics—items able to {{ward off}} revenants—are common in vampire folklore. Garlic is a common example, a branch of wild rose and {{hawthorn}} plant are said to harm vampires, and in Europe, sprinkling mustard seeds {{on the roof of}} a house was said to keep them away. Other apotropaics include sacred items, for example a crucifix, rosary, or holy water. Vampires <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unable to walk on consecrated ground, such as that of churches or temples, or cross running water.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} endopterygotes, beetle larvae pupate, and from these pupae emerge fully formed, sexually mature adult beetles, or imagos. Pupae never have mandibles (they are adecticous). In most pupae, the {{appendages}} are not {{attached to the}} body and <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> exarate; in a few beetles (Staphylinidae, Ptiliidae etc.) the appendages are fused with the body (termed as obtect pupae).|$|E

5|$|If gcd(a,b)=1, then a and b <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> coprime (or {{relatively}} prime). This property {{does not}} imply that a or b are themselves prime numbers. For example, neither 6 nor 35 is a prime number, since they both have two prime factors: 6=2×3 and 35=5×7. Nevertheless, 6 and 35 are coprime. No natural number other than 1 divides both 6 and 35, since they have no prime factors in common.|$|E

These criminals were enshrined in a secret ceremony in 1978, which has raised the ire of Japanese pacifists and the international community.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the ideas}} in The Satanic Bible are shaped around a secular, {{scientific}} view of the world.
