5|$|The {{synthesis}} of aziridines from imines {{is another important}} application of the Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction and provides an alternative to <b>amine</b> transfer from oxaziridines. Though less widely applied, the reaction has a similar substrate scope and functional group tolerance to the carbonyl equivalent. The examples shown below are representative; in the latter, an aziridine forms in situ and is opened via nucleophilic attack to form the corresponding <b>amine.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{amino acids}} have both a primary <b>amine</b> group and a primary {{carboxyl}} group, these chemicals can undergo {{most of the}} reactions associated with these functional groups. These include nucleophilic addition, amide bond formation, and imine formation for the <b>amine</b> group, and esterification, amide bond formation, and decarboxylation for the carboxylic acid group. The combination of these functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metal-amino acid chelates.|$|E
5|$|Proton sponge, 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene, has a pKa {{value of}} 12.1. It {{is one of}} the strongest <b>amine</b> bases known. The high {{basicity}} is attributed to the relief of strain upon protonation and strong internal hydrogen bonding.|$|E
50|$|Cyclic amines—Cyclic <b>amines</b> {{are either}} {{secondary}} or tertiary <b>amines.</b> Examples of cyclic <b>amines</b> include the 3-membered ring aziridine and the six-membered ring piperidine. N-methylpiperidine and N-phenylpiperidine {{are examples of}} cyclic tertiary <b>amines.</b>|$|R
40|$|The use of [Cp*IrI 2](2) as an {{efficient}} {{catalyst for the}} alkylation of <b>amines</b> by alcohols in either water or ionic liquid is described. Primary <b>amines</b> are converted into secondary <b>amines,</b> and secondary <b>amines</b> into tertiary <b>amines</b> {{in the absence of}} base, and the chemistry has been applied to the synthesis of the analgesic fentanyl. The conversion of primary <b>amines</b> into N-heterocycles by the reaction with diols is also described, along with the N-alkylation of sulfonamides...|$|R
5000|$|In organic chemistry, <b>amines</b> ( [...] , [...] ) are {{compounds}} and functional groups that contain a basic nitrogen atom with a lone pair. <b>Amines</b> are formally derivatives of ammonia, wherein {{one or more}} hydrogen atoms {{have been replaced by}} a substituent such as an alkyl or aryl group (these may respectively be called alkylamines and arylamines; <b>amines</b> in which both types of substituent are attached to one nitrogen atom may be called alkylarylamines). Important <b>amines</b> include amino acids, biogenic <b>amines,</b> trimethylamine, and aniline; see [...] for a list of <b>amines.</b> Inorganic derivatives of ammonia are also called <b>amines,</b> such as chloramine (NClH2); see [...]|$|R
5|$|Dopamine (DA, a {{contraction}} of 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families that plays several {{important roles in}} the brain and body. It is an <b>amine</b> synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical L-DOPA, which is synthesized {{in the brain and}} kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the original procedure shown above (which may have compatibility issues for sensitive substrates), Weinreb amides can be synthesized {{from a variety of}} acyl compounds. The vast majority of these procedures utilize the commercially available salt N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride , which is typically easier to handle than the free <b>amine.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{amino acids}} {{that have a}} carbon chain {{attached}} to the α–carbon (such as lysine, shown to the right) the carbons are labeled in order as α, β, γ, δ, and so on. In some amino acids, the <b>amine</b> group {{is attached to the}} β or γ-carbon, and these are therefore referred to as beta or gamma amino acids.|$|E
40|$|The {{alkylation}} of <b>amines</b> by alcohols {{has been}} achieved using 0. 5 mol % [Ru(p-cymene) Cl- 2](2) with the bidentate phosphines dppf or DPEphos as the catalyst. Primary <b>amines</b> have been converted into secondary <b>amines,</b> and secondary <b>amines</b> into tertiary <b>amines,</b> including the syntheses of Piribedil, Tripelennamine, and Chlorpheniramine. N-Heterocyclization reactions of primary <b>amines</b> are reported, as well as alkylation reactions of primary sulfonamides. Secondary alcohols require more forcing conditions than primary alcohols but are still effective alkylating agents {{in the presence of}} this catalyst...|$|R
5000|$|Aside {{from their}} basicity, the {{dominant}} reactivity of <b>amines</b> is their nucleophilicity. Most primary <b>amines</b> are good ligands for metal ions to give coordination complexes. <b>Amines</b> are alkylated by alkyl halides. Acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides react with {{primary and secondary}} <b>amines</b> to form amides (the [...] "Schotten-Baumann reaction").Similarly, with sulfonyl chlorides, one obtains sulfonamides. This transformation, known as the Hinsberg reaction, is a chemical test {{for the presence of}} <b>amines.</b>|$|R
50|$|There is a {{distinction}} between endogenous and exogenous biogenic <b>amines.</b> Endogenous <b>amines</b> are produced in many different tissues (for example: adrenaline in adrenal medulla or histamine in mast cells and liver). The <b>amines</b> are transmitted locally or via the blood system. The exogenous <b>amines</b> are directly absorbed from food in the intestine. Alcohol can increase the absorption rate. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) breaks down biogenic <b>amines</b> and prevents excessive resorption. MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) are also used as medications {{for the treatment of}} depression to prevent MAO from breaking down <b>amines</b> important for positive mood.|$|R
5|$|Treatment of an ester or lactone with AlMe3 or AlMe2Cl affords the {{corresponding}} Weinreb amide in good yields. Alternatively, non-nucleophilic Grignard reagents such as isopropyl magnesium chloride {{can be used}} to activate the <b>amine</b> before addition of the ester.|$|E
5|$|Most {{methods that}} {{separate}} neptunium ions exploit the differing chemical behaviour of the differing oxidation states of neptunium (from +3 to +6 or sometimes even +7) in solution. Among the methods that are {{or have been}} used are: solvent extraction (using various extractants, usually multidentate β-diketone derivatives, organophosphorus compounds, and <b>amine</b> compounds), chromatography using various ion-exchange or chelating resins, coprecipitation (possible matrices include LaF3, BiPO4, BaSO4, Fe(OH)3, and MnO2), electrodeposition, and biotechnological methods. Currently, commercial reprocessing plants use the Purex process, involving the solvent extraction of uranium and plutonium with tributyl phosphate.|$|E
5|$|While lipid tails {{primarily}} modulate bilayer phase behavior, {{it is the}} headgroup {{that determines}} the bilayer surface chemistry. Most natural bilayers are composed primarily of phospholipids, although sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin and sterols such as cholesterol are also important components. Of the phospholipids, the most common headgroup is phosphatidylcholine (PC), accounting for about half the phospholipids in most mammalian cells. PC is a zwitterionic headgroup, as it has a negative charge on the phosphate group and a positive charge on the <b>amine</b> but, because these local charges balance, no net charge.|$|E
5000|$|Hydrogen bonding {{significantly}} {{influences the}} properties of primary and secondary <b>amines.</b> Thus the melting point and boiling point of <b>amines</b> is {{higher than those of}} the corresponding phosphines, but generally lower than those of the corresponding alcohols and carboxylic acids. For example, methyl and ethyl <b>amines</b> are gases under standard conditions, whereas the corresponding methyl and ethyl alcohols are liquids. <b>Amines</b> possess a characteristic ammonia smell, liquid <b>amines</b> have a distinctive [...] "fishy" [...] smell.|$|R

50|$|<b>Amines</b> follow {{nitrogen}} rule. Odd {{molecular ion}} mass to charge ratio suggests existence of odd numbers of nitrogens. Nonetheless, molecular ion peaks are weak in aliphatic <b>amines</b> {{due to the}} ease of fragmentation next to <b>amines.</b> Alpha-cleavage reactions {{are the most important}} fragmentation mode for amines; for 1° n-aliphatic <b>amines,</b> there is an intense peak at m/z 30. Aromatic <b>amines</b> have intense molecular ion peaks. For anilines, they prefer to lose a hydrogen atom before the expulsion of HCN.|$|R
5|$|Adrenaline and {{noradrenaline}} are catecholamines, water-soluble {{compounds that}} have a structure made of a catechol group and an <b>amine</b> group. The adrenal glands are {{responsible for most of}} the adrenaline that circulates in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating noradrenaline. These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of breathing and heart rate, an increase in blood pressure, and constriction of blood vessels {{in many parts of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{must first}} pass out of organelles and cells into blood {{circulation}} via amino acid transporters, since the <b>amine</b> and carboxylic acid groups are typically ionized. Degradation of an amino acid, {{occurring in the}} liver and kidneys, often involves deamination by moving its amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate. This process involves transaminases, often {{the same as those}} used in amination during synthesis. In many vertebrates, the amino group is then removed through the urea cycle and is excreted in the form of urea. However, amino acid degradation can produce uric acid or ammonia instead. For example, serine dehydratase converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia. After removal of one or more amino groups, the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids, or it can be used for energy by entering glycolysis or the citric acid cycle, as detailed in image at right.|$|E
5|$|As {{both the}} <b>amine</b> and {{carboxylic}} acid groups of amino acids can {{react to form}} amide bonds, one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins. This condensation reaction yields the newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead, the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond. As {{a result of this}} mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving toward their C-terminus.|$|E
30|$|The {{carbamoylation}} {{reaction of}} various aliphatic <b>amines</b> and aniline with dimethyl carbonate was investigated {{and the study}} of the activity of five catalysts in the described process presented. The carbamoylation of linear primary aliphatic <b>amines</b> occurred with relatively high yields while non-linear primary aliphatic <b>amines</b> and secondary aliphatic <b>amines</b> are less active in reaction with DMC.|$|R
50|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{functional}} groups including alcohols, carboxylic acids, and <b>amines</b> are tolerated in the Petasis Reaction. Known substrates that are compatible with reaction conditions include vinylboronate esters, arylboronate esters, and potassium organotrifluoroborates. Additionally, a variety of substituted <b>amines</b> can be used other than secondary <b>amines.</b> Tertiary aromatic <b>amines,</b> hydrazines, hydroxylamines, sulfonamides, and indoles have all been reported.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the {{determination}} of selected biogenic <b>amines</b> in selected varieties vine fruit. The literature review describes the characteristics of biogenic <b>amines,</b> their creation, It is specified formation of biogenic <b>amines</b> individual microbiological agents and their health effects on the human organism. Then work characterized the winemaking process, and possible effects creation and content of biogenic <b>amines</b> in its manufacture. Custom work is divided into several parts Were monitored randomly collected samples of wines from around the Moravian region and analyzed the contents of biogenic <b>amines.</b> During alcoholic fermentation, malolacical fermentation and purification process was monitored training and development of these substances. Was observed dynamics of biogenic <b>amines</b> during fermentation and BA were determined after malolactical fermentation. Investigate the possibility of elimination of biogenic <b>amines</b> in wine clarification - were studied reduction of biogenic <b>amines</b> using standard fining agents (bentonite, gelatin, PVPP, Tosil). Watch biogenic <b>amines</b> (histamine, tyrosine, tryptamine, cadaverine, spermidine, spermine and putrescine) will be analyzed {{in a sample of}} chromatographic separation and quantified by comparison with standards...|$|R
5|$|At the {{prenatal}} and neonatal {{stages of}} life, {{the presence of}} antibodies is provided by passive immunization from the mother. Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies, and usually appear within {{the first years of}} life. Since antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream, they are said {{to be part of the}} humoral immune system. Circulating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one antigen (an example is a virus capsid protein fragment). Antibodies contribute to immunity in three ways: They prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by macrophages and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other immune responses such as the complement pathway. Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive <b>amine</b> degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens).|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of rat and human urine by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, mephedrone {{is thought to be}} metabolised by three phase 1 pathways. It can be demethylated to the primary <b>amine</b> (producing compounds 2, 3 and 5), the ketone group can be reduced (producing 3) or the tolyl group can be oxidised (producing 6). Both 5 and 6 are thought to be further metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide and sulfate derivatives. Knowledge of the primary routes of metabolism should allow the intake of mephedrone to be confirmed by drug tests, as well as more accurate determination of the causes of side effects and potential for toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Mephedrone can be {{synthesised}} {{in several}} ways. The simplest method, {{due to the}} availability of the compounds, is to add 4-methylpropiophenone dissolved in glacial acetic acid to bromine, creating an oil fraction of 4'-methyl-2-bromopropiophenone. The oil fraction can then be dissolved in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and drops of the solution added to another solution of CH2Cl2-containing methylamine hydrochloride and triethylamine. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is then added and the aqueous layer is removed and turned alkaline using sodium hydroxide before the <b>amine</b> is extracted using CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 is then evaporated using a vacuum, creating an oil which is then dissolved in a nonaqueous ether. Finally, HCl gas is bubbled through the mixture to produce 4-methylmethcathinone hydrochloride. This method produces a mixture of both enantiomers and requires similar knowledge to that required to synthesise amphetamines and MDMA.|$|E
40|$|A {{simple method}} for the N-alkylation of primary <b>amines</b> was {{developed}} using ionic liquids as solvent {{in order to}} prepare secondary <b>amines</b> selectively. In ionic liquids overalkylation of the initially produced secondary <b>amines</b> is in general markedly reduced. Various <b>amines,</b> alkyl halides and sulfonates were examined. The observed selectivities between mono- and dialkylation are typically {{on the order of}} 9 + 1, or higher. Only in the cases of allyl or benzyl bromides does the reaction give the corresponding tertiary <b>amines</b> exclusively. The relative nucleofugality of chloride, bromide, iodide and tosylate with several primary <b>amines</b> was also evaluated, as well as the effect of caesium hydroxide...|$|R
40|$|During normal cooking of meat, a {{class of}} mutagenic/carcinogenic {{compounds}} called heterocyclic <b>amines</b> is formed.

5|$|Most {{proteins}} {{consist of}} linear polymers built from series {{of up to}} 20 different L-α-amino acids. All proteinogenic amino acids possess common structural features, including an α-carbon to which an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a variable side chain are bonded. Only proline differs from this basic structure as it contains an unusual ring to the N-end <b>amine</b> group, which forces the CO–NH amide moiety into a fixed conformation. The side chains of the standard amino acids, detailed {{in the list of}} standard amino acids, have a great variety of chemical structures and properties; it is the combined effect of all of the amino acid side chains in a protein that ultimately determines its three-dimensional structure and its chemical reactivity.|$|E
5|$|Proteins {{based on}} {{cobalamin}} use corrin {{to hold the}} cobalt. Coenzyme B12 features a reactive C-Co bond that participates in the reactions. In humans, B12 has two types of alkyl ligand: methyl and adenosyl. MeB12 promotes methyl (-CH3) group transfers. The adenosyl version of B12 catalyzes rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an <b>amine.</b> Methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase (MUT) converts MMl-CoA to Su-CoA, {{an important step in}} the extraction of energy from proteins and fats.|$|E
