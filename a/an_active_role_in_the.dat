5|$|Both vessels were {{involved}} in the operations off Lissa in July 1866, but neither took part in the Battle of Lissa on 20 July. Formidabile had been damaged by Austrian coastal fortifications the day before, and had withdrawn for repairs; Terribile was ready for action, but had been preparing to attack Lissa and was too far south to take <b>an</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> battle. Both ships saw minimal use in the 1870s and 1880s, until both were withdrawn from service for use as training ships. Formidabile and Terribile served in this capacity until 1903 and 1904, respectively, when they were sold and broken up for scrap.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: There {{is growing}} {{emphasis}} to include patients in medical decision-making (MDM). Still, not all patients are {{actively involved in}} MDM. It depends upon circumstances whether they are actively involved. Until now, research mainly focused {{on the influence of}} characteristics of the patient and the diagnosis on patients’ preferences for active involvement. However, in examining this, a patient’s social context also has {{to be taken into account}} as social norms, as well as social resources, affect individual behavior. We examined the influence of social resources - in the form of informational and emotional support - on the intention to have <b>an</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> MDM. Methods: In 2013, a survey was sent to members of the Dutch Health Care Consumer Panel (response 70 %; n = 1, 300). Questions: were aimed at measuring the intention to have <b>an</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> MDM, informational and emotional support. Patient characteristics (age, gender, educational level) were taken into account too. A regression model was constructed to explain the influence of informational and emotional support on the intention to have <b>an</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> MDM. Results: people who have more informational support from their social network are more likely to intend to have <b>an</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> MDM. For low educated people emotional support positively influences their intention to have <b>an</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> MDM. People with a middle and high level of education are more likely to intend to have <b>an</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> MDM, no matter what level of emotional support. Finally, the older people are the less likely they intend to have <b>an</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> MDM. Conclusions: This study shows that social context influences the intention to have <b>an</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> MDM. To enhance patient participation in MDM, it is recommended to examine how people without support from their social network can be supported. The provision of information (e. g. by a decision aid) or the use of volunteers who can give emotional support might have a <b>role</b> <b>in</b> this. Key messages Informational support (for all people) and emotional support (only for low educated people) positively influence the intention to have <b>an</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> medical decisionmaking To enhance patient participation in medical decisionmaking, it is recommended to examine how people without support from their social network can be supporte...|$|R

5|$|Clement {{argues for}} the {{equality}} of sexes, {{on the grounds that}} salvation is extended to all of mankind equally. Unusually, he suggests that Christ is neither male or female, and that God the Father has both male and female aspects: the eucharist is described as milk from the breast (Christ) of the Father. He is supportive of women playing <b>an</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> leadership of the church, and provides a list of women he considers inspirational, which includes both Biblical and Classical Greek figures. It has been suggested that Clement's progressive views on gender as set out in the Paedagogus were influenced by Gnosticism. However, later in the work, he argues against the Gnostics that faith, not esoteric knowledge , is required for salvation. According to Clement, it is through faith in Christ that we are enlightened and come to know God.|$|E

He was sent summaries of important government documents, but she refused to give him access to the originals. He annoyed his mother by siding with Denmark on the Schleswig-Holstein Question in 1864 (she was pro-German) {{and in the same}} year annoyed her again by making a special effort to meet Giuseppe Garibaldi. Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone sent him papers secretly. From 1886, Foreign Secretary Lord Rosebery sent him Foreign Office despatches, and from 1892 some Cabinet papers were opened to him.|$|E

In the first three years of the war, the soldiers were involved in several small-scale battles connected to the First Suez Offensive, but spent most of their time patrolling in the Sinai Desert and along the west bank of the canal. It was not until November 1917 as part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force that the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade was involved in the Third Battle of Gaza. The following year the brigade joined the 5th Cavalry Division when it became the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade and played <b>an</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British victory over Turkish forces in Palestine.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930s, Arsenal {{were the}} {{dominant}} side of England, winning five league championships and two FA Cups. Their fortunes waned, but the club soon enjoyed infrequent periods of success, including Inter-Cities Fairs Cup triumph and a first league and cup {{double in the}} 1970s. During the late 1980s, Arsenal had built a side that threatened Liverpool's league dominance, and performed greatly in cup competitions. The club played <b>an</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> formation of the Premier League in 1992, and two doubles followed in 1998 and 2002. Arsenal made league history in 2003–04 when they became the first team in a 38-game season to go unbeaten. In the 2000s, Arsenal were finalists in both the UEFA Cup and UEFA Champions League, and have since equalled Real Madrid's record for most consecutive seasons in the latter competition.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s {{a period of}} {{financial}} and leadership disputes occurred within the church hierarchy, with church treasurer, Stanley Rader, {{at the center of}} many of the disputes. The gravest incident was the church bwing placed in financial receivership by the Attorney General of California, George Deukmejian, an action that was later disallowed in court. Tkach took <b>an</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> defense of Armstrong, Rader, and the church headquarters' operations. He rallied the WCG membership to take action against the court proceedings. Armstrong recognized his effectiveness and subsequently ordained him to the rank of evangelist on September 27, 1979. See Evangelists of the Worldwide Church of God. In March 1981 Armstrong appointed him to the WCG's advisory council of elders, and eventually, Armstrong named him Director of Church Administration, {{one of the most prominent}} administrative positions other than Armstrong himself.|$|E

Despite guarantees of safety, Mosele was imprisoned and later blinded at the instigation of Irene and Staurakios, both eager to take revenge for his role in their overthrow in 790.|$|E

He spoke in support of a bill to set the taxes by law at a demonstration at the Palace of the Argentine National Congress. Many senators who had supported the government rejected the proposal, and the voting was tied 36–36. Vice-President Julio Cobos, president of the Chamber of Senators, cast the decisive vote in opposition to the measure.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Lebanese Civil War of 1975–90, {{the party}} was closely allied to the Phalangist Party of Pierre Gemayel and {{generally}} ran joint tickets with the Phalangists, especially in Beirut constituencies with large Armenian populations. The refusal of the ARF, along with most Armenian groups, to play <b>an</b> <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> civil war, however, soured {{relations between the two}} parties, and the Lebanese Forces (a militia dominated by Phalangists and commanded by Bachir Gemayel, Pierre Gemayel's son), responded by attacking the Armenian quarters of many Lebanese towns, including Bourj Hammoud. Many Armenians affiliated with the ARF took up arms voluntarily to defend their quarters. In the midst of the Lebanese civil war, the shadowy guerrilla organization Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide emerged and carried out assassinations from 1975 to 1983. The guerrilla organization has sometimes been linked to the Dashnaks.|$|E
