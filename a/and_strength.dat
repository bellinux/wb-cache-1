40|$|Social work {{assessment}} {{in mental health}} refers {{to the process of}} developing with the client a shared understanding of both problems <b>and</b> <b>strengths</b> in the individual and his or her social context. Comprehensive assessment is biopsychosocial, addressing the the physical, psychological, and social aspects of problems <b>and</b> <b>strengths.</b> It includes problems <b>and</b> <b>strengths</b> in social role functioning, environmental issues, such as financial and other basic needs, problems <b>and</b> <b>strengths</b> in the family, significant relationships and other social supports, and cultural factors. Assessment is both a product and a process.

5|$|A third {{component}} of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves {{the interaction of}} multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems. Depending on their separation distance <b>and</b> <b>strength,</b> the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit around it. This phenomenon is called the Fujiwhara effect, after Sakuhei Fujiwhara.|$|E
5|$|After {{an episode}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy, 80% of people develop hypopituitarism and require some form of hormone replacement therapy. The most common problem is growth hormone deficiency, which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass <b>and</b> <b>strength,</b> obesity and fatigue. 60–80% require hydrocortisone replacement (either permanently or when unwell), 50–60% need thyroid hormone replacement, and 60–80% of men require testosterone supplements. Finally, 10–25% develop diabetes insipidus, the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys {{due to a lack}} of the pituitary antidiuretic hormone. This may be treated with the drug desmopressin, which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth.|$|E

5|$|After boiling, the {{hopped wort}} is now cooled, {{ready for the}} yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add {{aromatic}} hop flavouring and {{to act as a}} filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months {{depending on the type of}} yeast <b>and</b> <b>strength</b> of the beer. In addition to producing ethanol, fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.|$|E
5|$|Although a large {{horse is}} not {{required}} to carry an armoured knight, it is held by some historians that a large horse was desirable to increase the power of a lance strike. However, practical experiments by re-enactors have suggested that the rider's weight <b>and</b> <b>strength</b> is of more relevance than the size of the mount, and that little of the horse's weight is translated to the lance.|$|E

While competing on the powerplay, he often uses his size <b>and</b> <b>strength</b> to maintain position in front of the opposing net to either screen the goaltender or deflect shots.|$|E

5|$|Charles XI has {{sometimes}} been described in Sweden as {{the greatest of all}} the Swedish kings, except for Gustavus II Adolphus, unduly eclipsed by his father and his son. In {{the first half of the}} 20th century, the view of him changed and he was regarded as dependent, uncertain, and easily influenced by others.

5|$|Construction of the North Carolina {{class was}} slowed by the {{aforementioned}} material issues, the changes {{made to the}} basic design after this date—namely the substitution of 16-inch for 14-inch guns—and the need to add both length <b>and</b> <b>strength</b> to the slipways already present in the navy yards. Increased use of welding was proposed as a possible way to reduce weight and bolster the structural design, as it could have reduced the ships' structural weight by 10%, but it was utilized in only about 30% of the ship. The costs associated with welding {{and an increase in}} the time of construction made it impractical.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the effects of melt temperature and hold pressure on the static tensile and fatigue be-havior of an injection-molded 40 wt % talc-filled polypro-pylene. Injection molding caused anisotropy in the ma-terial. Both yield <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> fatigue <b>strength</b> {{were higher in the}} flow direction. The presence of weld line caused a large reduction in yield <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> fatigue <b>strength.</b> For specimens in the flow direction, both yield <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> fatigue <b>strength</b> increased with increasing hold pressure, but they were relatively insensitive to melt temperature. For specimens normal to the flow direc-tion, both yield <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> fatigue <b>strength</b> increased with increasing hold pressure and decreased with increas-ing melt temperature. For specimens containing a weld line, the yield <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> fatigue <b>strength</b> increased with increasing hold pressure as well as increasing melt tem-perature. The observed differences in properties are ex-plained in terms of the skin-core morphology, which was influenced by both melt temperature and hold pressure...|$|R

When the Allies eventually invaded the Normandy beaches in 1944, most of the defences were stormed within hours.
