5|$|Sentenced for the {{kidnapping}} of the Baroness of Valpetrosa in 1898, Cascioferro was released in 1900. To escape special police surveillance in Sicily, he sailed to the United States and <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City {{at the end of}} September 1901. He lived for about 2 years in New York, acting as an importer of fruits and foods. He also spent six months in New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|The ship's {{movements}} under Army {{control are}} largely unknown, but in January 1941, The New York Times reported that USAT West Corum had <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> from Puerto Rico.

5|$|Bellomont sailed for New York in late 1697, {{accompanied}} by his wife and her cousin, John Nanfan, who had been appointed Lieutenant Governor of New York. The voyage was exceptionally stormy, and Bellomont's ship was blown well south, eventually putting into Barbados before continuing on to New York. He <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City on 2 April 1698. Bellomont's stylish dress, good looks, and positive relationship with the king predisposed New Yorkers to like him, but he very quickly ran into difficulties and began making enemies.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Reed, who {{was trying}} to get home, was unable to get State Department {{clearance}} for a visa and was detained in Oslo (then called Christiana), Norway, for more than a month. His letters were censored, and Bryant did not hear from him directly until April. On orders from Edgar Sisson of the U.S. Commission on Public Information, all of Reed's papers were confiscated when he <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> on April 28. Unable to write about the October Revolution without his notes, Reed instead gave speeches advocating U.S. recognition of the new Russian government. That summer, the couple retreated to Croton-on-Hudson.|$|E
5|$|Newlyweds Francis B. Sayre, an {{assistant}} district attorney in New York, and Jessie Woodrow Wilson Sayre, the daughter of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, sailed in November 1913 for a European honeymoon. The couple, wed at the White House, traveled in one of George Washingtons imperial suites. The following January, English playwright W. Somerset Maugham quietly slipped out of New York on George Washington. Maugham had <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> in mid November to see Billie Burke in the New York premiere of his play, The Land of Promise.|$|E

The flotilla met George Washington and her escorts (Pennsylvania and four destroyers) just off Brest and escorted them into the port. The 10 battleships sailed for home at 14:00 on the next day, 14 December. They took less than two weeks to cross the Atlantic, and <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> on 26 December to parades and celebrations.|$|E
5|$|Strong {{was born}} on 13 February 1880 in Ramsgate, Kent, England, to William R. Strong (1846–1899) and Charlotte E. Strong née Stock (1850–1923). Like many golfers from his era, he was first {{introduced}} to golf via his participation as a caddie when he toted bags at Royal St George's Golf Club located in Sandwich, England, in the mid-1890s. In 1905 he emigrated to the United States, departing Liverpool on 14 June 1905 aboard the RMS Teutonic which <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> on 22 June 1905 with $400 in his pocket, a hefty sum at the time.|$|E

5|$|Even before Carpathia <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> {{efforts were}} getting {{underway}} {{to retrieve the}} dead. Four ships chartered by the White Star Line succeeded in retrieving 328bodies; 119 were buried at sea, while the remaining 209 were brought ashore to the Canadian port of Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 150 of them were buried. Memorials were raised in various places– New York, Washington, Southampton, Liverpool, Belfast and Lichfield, among others– and ceremonies were held {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic to commemorate the dead and raise funds to aid the survivors. The bodies of most of Titanics victims were never recovered, and the only evidence of their deaths was found 73years later among the debris on the seabed: pairs of shoes lying side by side, where bodies had once lain before eventually decomposing.|$|E
5|$|Thomas <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> on 20 October 1953 to {{undertake}} another tour of poetry-reading and talks, organised by Brinnin. Although he complained of chest trouble and gout {{while still in}} Britain, {{there is no record}} that he received medical treatment for either condition. He was in a melancholy mood about the trip and his health was poor; he relied on an inhaler to aid his breathing and there were reports that he was suffering from blackouts. His visit to say goodbye to BBC producer Philip Burton, a few days before he left for New York, was interrupted by a blackout. On his last night in London he had another in the company of his fellow poet Louis MacNeice. The next day he visited a doctor for a smallpox-vaccination certificate.|$|E
5|$|With the Nazi {{invasion}} of Belgium on 10 May 1940, Zita {{and her family}} became war refugees. They narrowly missed being killed by a direct hit on the castle by German bombers and fled to Prince Xavier's French Castle in Bostz. The Habsburgs then fled to the Spanish border, reaching it on 18 May. They moved on to Portugal where the U.S. Government granted the family exit visas on 9 July. After a perilous journey they <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City on 27 July, having family in Long Island and Newark, New Jersey.; at one point, Zita and several of her children lived, as long-term house-guests, in Tuxedo Park, New York.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} the cadets to Annapolis on 24–25 August, Wyoming {{took part in}} gunnery and torpedo training {{over the next few}} weeks. On 16 September, she returned to New York for repairs, which lasted until 2 October. She then ran full–power sea trials before proceeding to the Virginia Capes, where she participated in another round of fleet maneuvers. Next, she departed for a European goodwill cruise on 26 October. She toured the Mediterranean Sea, stopping in Valletta, Malta, Naples, Italy, and Villefranche, France. She departed France on 30 November, and <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> on 15 December. There, she went into dock at the New York Navy Yard for periodic repairs, which lasted until January 1914. On the 6th, Wyoming left for Hampton Roads, where she took on coal in preparation for the annual fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|In May 1920 Princess Matoika took {{on board}} the bodies of ten female nurses and over 400soldiers who died while on duty in France during the war. The ship then transited the Kiel Canal and picked up 1,600U.S. {{residents}} of Polish descent at Danzig, {{all of whom had}} enlisted in the Polish Army {{at the outset of the}} war. Also included among the passengers were 500U.S. soldiers who had been released from occupation duty at Koblenz. The ship arrived at New York on 23May with little fanfare and no ceremony; bodies returned but not claimed by families were buried at Arlington National Cemetery. On 21 July, Princess Matoika <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> after a similar voyage with 25war brides, many repatriated Polish troops among its 2,094 steerage passengers, and the remains of 881soldiers. In between these two trips, the Belgian Ambassador to the United States, Baron Emile de Cartier de Marchienne, sailed from New York to Belgium {{on board the}} Matoika. It was, however, Princess Matoikas next trip to Belgium that was the most infamous.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} with Germany {{came to an}} end a few weeks after Operation Effective was cancelled, and shortly afterwards it was announced that the division would be redeployed to the Pacific to participate in the invasion of Japan after a brief stop-over in the United States. The deactivation of the 17th Airborne Division meant that the 13th acquired several combat units from that division to bolster it for its envisioned action in Japan. The division <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City on 23 August, but did not leave the United States before the surrender of Japan in September 1945. With the conflict at an end, the division was no longer required by the United States Army, and it was permanently inactivated at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on 25 February 1946, with its personnel transferred to the command of the 82nd Airborne Division.|$|E
