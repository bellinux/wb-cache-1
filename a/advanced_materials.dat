40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} inventory performance effect of <b>advanced</b> <b>material</b> planning modes and analyses how {{internal and external}} contextual difficulties moderate this relationship. This study also identifies avenues for future research. The empirical analysis uses a survey of material planning for purchased items in 292 Swedish manufacturing and wholesaling companies. Three dimensions of inventory performance are dependent variables: material planning performance, inventory turnover rate and service level. <b>Advanced</b> <b>material</b> planning modes are directly associated with material planning performance, but this study could not verify direct associations with inventory turnover rate and service level performances. External and internal contextual difficulties have direct effects on all inventory performance dimensions and moderate the inventory performance effect of <b>advanced</b> <b>material</b> planning modes. The moderating effect is stronger in non-difficult contexts, for which <b>advanced</b> <b>material</b> planning has significant inventory performance effects. Demand- and human-related contextual dimensions are especially critical. The study identifies the following guidelines for companies to consider in order to unlock the potential of <b>advanced</b> <b>material</b> planning: consider full implementation of <b>advanced</b> <b>material</b> planning in non-difficult contexts; minimize plan variability effects of high parameter revision and planning frequencies; minimize the need for, and use of, manual modification of planned orders before release; reduce demand uncertainty and variability; and secure appropriate human skills and working time. This study somewhat contradicts the literature on material planning by not finding a direct positive effect on any inventory performance dimension from analytical design of order quantities and safety stocks. Our research adds to the literature by identifying direct and moderating effects of external and internal contextual difficulties on all three inventory performance dimensions. The relative importance of managing automatic order release identified in our study motivates future research as the effect has not been previously highlighted in the literature. Accordingly avenues for future research and an agenda for practice-oriented research are suggested...|$|R

40|$|A typical {{approach}} to inviting individuals {{to participate in}} a face-to-face survey is to send <b>advance</b> <b>materials</b> and then follow up with an interviewer call to arrange an appointment to conduct an interview. This model is very much interviewer-driven; interviewers mail <b>advance</b> <b>materials</b> themselves, decide themselves when to attempt initial contact and to an extent arrange appointments around their own availability. A trial conducted by the National Longitudinal Surveys in America found that financially incentivising respondents to contact interviewers directly to arrange appointments significantly reduced the interviewer time required to achieve a productive interview. The savings in interviewer time more than outweighed the cost of providing incentives. In this paper we present the results of a randomised control experiment, conducted in 2011 amongst 1400 households in the UK Household Longitudinal Study Innovation Panel, which seeks to evaluate the potential impact on co-operation rates and cost-efficiencies which could be achieved by encouraging respondents (with and without financial reward) to contact interviewers to schedule appointments. Households were randomly allocated to one of three groups. Two groups received <b>advance</b> <b>materials</b> two weeks before fieldwork began. These materials sought to encourage participants to be an ‘Early-Bird’ and contact their interviewer to arrange an appointment in {{the first two weeks of}} fieldwork. Group 1 were offered a financial incentive (to all members of the household) to do this whereas the encouragement for Group 2 was additional text in the <b>advance</b> <b>materials</b> explaining that being an ‘Early-Bird’ would make ‘your interviewer’s life much easier as they will not have to make repeated telephone calls or visits to your home in order to reach you’. The third group acted as a control group and received the ‘standard’ contact strategy – <b>advance</b> <b>materials</b> were posted at the beginning of fieldwork and followed by the interviewer attempting to make contact...|$|R
