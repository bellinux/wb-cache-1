5|$|Astrometric {{observations}} {{with the}} Hubble Space Telescope measured an inclination of 53° {{of the outer}} planet d, though this result relies on the precise orbital parameters which have been substantially revised since this was published. The observed transits of e suggest <b>an</b> <b>orbit</b> normal inclined within 9° to the line-of-light, and a possible detection of the transit of an extended atmosphere around 55 Cancri b would, if confirmed, imply that it too is in <b>an</b> <b>orbit</b> that is close to edge-on. Between them, no measurement of c's nor f's inclination has been made. It had been thought that with five planets, the system cannot deviate far from coplanar {{in order to maintain}} stability. An attempt to measure the spin-orbit misalignment of the innermost planet reported that it was in a nearly polar orbit, but this interpretation of the data has since been challenged by a subsequent study, with noted inconsistencies between the implied and measured stellar rotation.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 d {{is located}} in <b>an</b> <b>orbit</b> with a semimajor axis of only 0.0208 AU (3.11 million km).

5|$|HD 154672 b had, at {{the time}} of its 2008 discovery, an orbital period larger than 90% of all {{discovered}} planets. It was the seventh planet known to have an eccentricity over 0.6 and <b>an</b> <b>orbit</b> shorter than 300 days.|$|E

5|$|Wanting to {{understand}} the strange light pattern, Tabetha S. Boyajian put several hypotheses to the test.

5|$|Haumea's moons are {{unusual in}} a number of ways.

Hiʻiaka, the larger, outermost moon, has large amounts of pure water ice on its surface, which is rare among Kuiper belt objects. Namaka, about one tenth the mass, has <b>an</b> <b>orbit</b> with surprising dynamics: it is unusually eccentric and appears to be greatly influenced by the larger satellite.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, further {{measurements}} {{revealed the}} presence of a long-period planet in <b>an</b> <b>orbit</b> at around 5 AU from the star. Even when both of the two planets were accounted for, there was still a periodicity at around 43 days. However, this period is close to the rotation period of 55 Cancri A, which led to the possibility that the 43-day period was caused by stellar rotation rather than a planet. Both the 43-day planet (designated 55 Cancri c) and the 5 AU planet (designated 55 Cancri d) were announced in the same paper, labeled in order of increasing distance from the star.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter trojans do not {{maintain}} a fixed separation from Jupiter. They slowly librate around their respective equilibrium points, periodically {{moving closer to}} Jupiter or farther from it. Jupiter trojans generally follow paths called tadpole orbits around the Lagrangian points; the average period of their libration is about 150 years. The amplitude of the libration (along the Jovian orbit) varies from 0.6° to 88°, with the average being about 33°. Simulations show that Jupiter trojans can follow even more complicated trajectories when moving from one Lagrangian point to another—these are called horseshoe orbits (currently no Jupiter Trojan with such <b>an</b> <b>orbit</b> is known).|$|E

5|$|The {{eccentricity}} of <b>an</b> <b>orbit</b> {{describes how}} elongated a planet's orbit is.
