5|$|The Khewra Salt Mine is {{also known}} as Mayo Salt Mine, in honour of Lord Mayo, who visited it as Viceroy of India. The mine is a part of <b>a</b> <b>salt</b> range that {{originated}} about 800 million years ago, when evaporation of a shallow sea followed by geological movement formed <b>a</b> <b>salt</b> range that stretched for about 300 kilometers (185 miles).|$|E
5|$|Although President Jimmy Carter {{tried to}} place another {{limit on the}} arms race with <b>a</b> <b>SALT</b> II {{agreement}} in 1979, his efforts were undermined by the other events that year, including the Iranian Revolution and the Nicaraguan Revolution, which both ousted pro-US regimes, and his retaliation against Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in December.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} case, acetic acid reacts with the calcium {{carbonate}} (one {{of the main}} components of freshwater, marine and land shells, birds' eggs and other such specimens) producing calcium acetate, <b>a</b> <b>salt.</b> Formaldehyde can be oxidized by the oxygen in air to create formic acid, which then has basically the same effects as acetic acid, reacting with calcium carbonate to produce <b>a</b> <b>salt.</b> The salts (calcium acetate and calcium formate) crystallize through the specimen's outer surface, destroying its fine detail and exposing more areas for further reaction. As the condition progresses, the salt crystals build up over the specimen's surface, which becomes increasingly eroded.|$|E

5|$|A German archaeological {{team led}} by Ludwig Borchardt {{discovered}} the bust in 1912 in Thutmose's workshop. It has been kept at various locations in Germany since its discovery, including the cellar of a bank, <b>a</b> <b>salt</b> mine in Merkers-Kieselbach, the Dahlem museum, the Egyptian Museum in Charlottenburg and the Altes Museum. It is currently {{on display at the}} Neues Museum in Berlin, where it was originally displayed before World War II.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses, {{along with}} all Procellariiformes, must excrete the salts they ingest in {{drinking}} sea water and eating marine invertebrates. All birds have an enlarged nasal gland {{at the base of}} the bill, above their eyes. This gland is inactive in species that do not require it, but in the Procellariiformes it acts as <b>a</b> <b>salt</b> gland. Scientists are uncertain as to its exact processes, but do know in general terms that it removes salt by secreting a 5% saline solution that drips out of their nose or is forcibly ejected.|$|E

5|$|Maibaum {{may have}} thought the {{eventual}} oil-rig finale a poor substitute, but it was originally intended {{to be much more}} spectacular. Armed frogmen would jump from the helicopters into the sea and attach limpet mines to the rig's legs (this explains why frogmen appear on the movie's poster). Blofeld would have escaped in his BathoSub and Bond would have pursued him, hanging from a weather balloon. The chase would have continued across <b>a</b> <b>salt</b> mine, with the two mortal enemies scrambling over white hills of salt before Blofeld would fall to his death in <b>a</b> <b>salt</b> granulator. Permission was not granted by the owners of the salt mine. It also made the sequence too long. Further problems followed when the explosives set up for the finale were set off too early; fortunately, a handful of cameras were ready and able to capture the footage.|$|E
5|$|On 16 August, Clarisse {{departed}} Isle de France {{for another}} cruise; she sailed to La Réunion carrying despatches of Malartic to the governor. She then cruised to Java to procure water, where she arrived on 27 September. On 1 October, Surcouf captured a Danish merchantman, which he sent away under Lieutenant Fonroc; on 4 November, the Portuguese merchantman Nostra Signora de la Conception carrying 116 000 piastres; on 6, a British ship laden with <b>a</b> <b>salt</b> cargo; and on 11 November, the 20-gun Auspicious, with a cargo worth 1,032,580 francs.|$|E

5|$|What {{had begun}} as <b>a</b> <b>Salt</b> Satyagraha quickly {{grew into a}} mass Satyagraha. British cloth and goods were boycotted. Unpopular forest laws were defied in the Maharashtra, Karnataka and Central Provinces. Gujarati peasants refused to pay tax, under threat of losing their crops and land. In Midnapore, Bengalis took part by refusing to pay the chowkidar tax. The British responded with more laws, {{including}} censorship of correspondence and declaring the Congress and its associate organisations illegal. None of those measures slowed the civil disobedience movement.|$|E
5|$|With the {{discovery}} of gold in the area, gold rush brought miners to the area. In 1890, Willoughby Island in Glacier Bay {{was the scene of}} a meeting of the miners, which was followed by the establishment of the Berry mining district. In the 1890s, <b>a</b> <b>salt</b> mine was established at Bartlett Cove. Fox farms and a cannery were also established; however, the cannery was abandoned in 1935.|$|E

5|$|As Altrincham {{was part}} of the Bowdon parish, {{children}} from the township may have gone to the 16th-century school established at Bowdon; before that point, the town had no formal education system. <b>A</b> <b>salt</b> merchant from Dunham Woodhouses founded a school at Oldfield House intended for 40boys aged 8–11 from the surrounding area. Sunday schools were set up in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Altrincham's increasing population prompted the founding of more schools during the early 19th century and by 1856 the town had 9schools, 1college, and 23teachers. The introduction of compulsory education {{during the second half of}} the 19th century increased the demand for schools, and by 1886 Altrincham had 12church schools and 8private schools.|$|E
5|$|Boating on {{the canal}} is encouraged, {{although}} {{the lack of}} a link to the River Parrett at Bridgwater is restrictive. At this point, the Parrett is <b>a</b> <b>salt</b> water river, and is laden with silt, whereas the canal contains fresh water. Not only is there a risk of silt entering the canal, but the salt water cannot be allowed to contaminate the fresh, as the canal is still used for the transport of drinking water for the population of Bridgwater. The canal forms part of the local flood relief system, in winter taking water from the River Tone at Taunton and discharging it into the Parrett at a sluice in the western fringe of Bridgwater, near the Bridgwater Canalside Centre.|$|E
5|$|During India's {{independence}} struggle, Gandhi {{launched the}} Dandi March along India's west coast to {{protest against the}} sales tax levied on salt extraction. His close associate C. Rajagopalachari, who would later become independent India's first Governor-General, carried out <b>a</b> <b>salt</b> march in parallel, {{on the east coast}} starting from Trichonopoly (modern day Tiruchirappalli) in Vedaranyam. His group, having people like Sardar Vedaratnam, started from Tiruchirappalli, in Madras Presidency (now part of Tamil Nadu), to the coast of the town. After making illegal salt there on 30 April 1930, the group was arrested by the British. After India's independence, Vedaranyam continued {{to be a part of}} Thanjavur district until 1991, and later became part of the newly created Nagapattinam district.|$|E

50|$|Salt cellars are known, {{in various}} forms, by {{assorted}} names including open salt, salt dip, standing salt, master salt, and <b>salt</b> dish. <b>A</b> master <b>salt</b> {{is the large}} receptacle from which the smaller, distributed, salt dishes are filled; according to fashion or custom it was lidded, or open, or covered with a cloth. <b>A</b> standing <b>salt</b> is <b>a</b> master <b>salt,</b> so-named because it remained in place {{as opposed to being}} passed. <b>A</b> trencher <b>salt</b> is <b>a</b> small <b>salt</b> cellar located next to the trencher (i.e., place setting). Open salt and salt dip refer to salt dishes that are uncovered.|$|R
50|$|One {{example of}} <b>a</b> {{possible}} <b>salted</b> bomb {{would be a}} cobalt bomb, which would produce the radioactive isotope cobalt-60 (60Co). Other radioactive isotopes that have been suggested for salted bombs include gold-198 (198Au), tantalum-182 (182Ta) and zinc-65 (65Zn). Sodium-24 has also been proposed as <b>a</b> <b>salting</b> agent.|$|R
5|$|Erythranthe species tend to {{concentrate}} sodium chloride and other salts absorbed from the soils {{in which they}} grow in their leaves and stem tissues. Native Americans and early travelers in the American West used this plant as <b>a</b> <b>salt</b> substitute to season wild game. The entire plant is edible, but reported to be very salty and bitter unless well cooked. The juice from the leaves {{was used as a}} poultice for mild skin irritations and burns. Leaves can be used in salads and soups; flowers taste best before blooming. E. lutea has been used for cooking in Peru.|$|E
5|$|From the Han dynasty to {{the early}} Tang dynasty, Hong Kong {{was a part of}} Bao'an County. In the Tang dynasty, modern-day Guangzhou (Canton) flourished as an {{international}} trading centre. In 736, the Emperor Xuanzong of Tang established a military stronghold in Tuen Mun to strengthen defence of the coastal area. The nearby Lantau Island was <b>a</b> <b>salt</b> production centre and salt smuggler riots occasionally broke out against the government. In c. 1075, The first village school, Li Ying College, was established around 1075 AD in modern-day New Territories by the Northern Song dynasty. During their war against the Mongols, the imperial court of Southern Song was briefly stationed at modern-day Kowloon City (the Sung Wong Toi site) before their ultimate defeat by the Mongols at the Battle of Yamen in 1279. The Mongols then established their dynastic court and governed Hong Kong for 97 years.|$|E
5|$|In 1782, the British staged an {{invasion}} of Kentucky {{with the help of}} their Native American allies, including Wyandots, Ottawas and Ojibwas. When Trigg received word of their attack on Bryan Station, he was commanding the fort at Harrodsburg. He quickly assembled 135 local militiamen and met up with Colonel Daniel Boone and Major Levi Todd and more militia at Bryan Station. When they approached the Blue Licks, <b>a</b> <b>salt</b> lick next to the Licking River, officers suspected a trap and convened a war council, but unruly troops lost patience and crossed the river. The three leaders formed a column each, with Trigg commanding the right. When they met with the opposing force, Trigg's column was ambushed. Trigg was killed and his men fell back after only five minutes of battle. When troops returned to the scene of battle, Trigg's body was found quartered.|$|E
