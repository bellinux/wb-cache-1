25|$|Betting was heavy, with Cummings favoured over George. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun,</b> George dashed ahead, with Cummings close behind, in {{a steady}} rain. Cummings, who had won the coin toss, had chosen the third-of-a-mile {{rectangular}} cinder track at the site over the favoured quarter-mile cycling track. At the quarter mile point of the race, hindered by the slow track with sharp corners, George led with 58, a torrid pace which the crowd enthusiastically cheered.|$|E
500|$|All Captain Scarlet episodes, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the pilot episode, incorporate two sets of opening titles. The first of these sequences displays the title card and the primary production credits. The camera moves forward through the scale-model set of a run-down, night-time alleyway, forming the point-of-view shot of an unseen assassin, who turns a corner only to meet his death <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> barrel of Captain Scarlet. The two seven-letter words [...] "Captain Scarlet" [...] gradually appear in time with the seven strikes of the Captain Scarlet staccato drum beat composed by Barry Gray. This opening sequence is accompanied by a voice-over from Ed Bishop, which states: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{moved into}} a lightning-like {{mechanical}} response <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sharp cry from the officer overhead. Mechanism, the pure mechanical action of obedience <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns.</b> Pure mechanical action <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns.</b> It left <b>the</b> soul unburdened, brooding in dark nakedness. In the end, the soul is alone, brooding {{on the face of}} the uncreated flux, as a bird on a dark sea.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} Will was on shore {{in command of}} a party of thirty men who were to start getting up <b>the</b> <b>guns.</b> <b>The</b> sailors looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rock and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> in dismay.|$|R

500|$|By now all {{the ships}} in the convoy were within range to engage targets ashore and were firing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> emplacements and searchlights. Campbeltown was hit {{a number of times}} and {{increased}} her speed to [...] The helmsman on her bridge was killed; his replacement was wounded and replaced as well. Blinded by the searchlights, Beattie knew they were close to their objective. Still under heavy fire, the MGB turned into the estuary as Campbeltown cleared the end of the Old Mole, cut through anti-torpedo netting strung across the entrance and rammed the dock gates, striking home at 01:34, three minutes later than scheduled. The force of the impact drove the ship [...] onto the gates.|$|E
500|$|The {{existing}} wooden carriages for 11-inch {{guns were}} {{too long to}} fit in New Ironsidess cramped battery. A new iron carriage was built where the gun rode in a cradle that slid on iron rails. The new carriages pivoted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> ports to minimize {{the size of the}} ports. Two compressors, or clamps, were fitted to squeeze the rails and increase friction between the rails and the cradle, but these were not strong enough to handle the recoil force when the gun was fired. Two more compressors were fitted as well as rope [...] to restrain the guns, but neither was entirely satisfactory. The problem was not resolved until December 1862 when strips of ash wood were placed underneath the compressors; the friction of iron on wood was double that of iron on iron and the increased friction solved the problem.|$|E
500|$|In {{reaction}} to this attempt, the Secret Service began keeping Ford at a more secure distance from anonymous crowds, a strategy that may have saved his life seventeen days later. As he left the St. Francis Hotel in downtown San Francisco, Sara Jane Moore, standing in a crowd of onlookers across the street, pointed her [...]38-caliber revolver at him. Moore fired a single round but missed because the sights were off. Just before she fired a second round, retired Marine Oliver Sipple grabbed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> and deflected her shot; the bullet struck a wall about six inches above {{and to the right}} of Ford's head, then ricocheted and hit a taxi driver, who was slightly wounded. Moore was later sentenced to life in prison. She was paroled on December 31, 2007, after serving 32 years.|$|E

500|$|Canonicus sailed from Boston on 22 April 1864 {{and arrived}} at Newport News, Virginia on 3 May for service with the James River Flotilla. She reached {{the mouth of the}} Appomattox River by 5 May. By 22 May, the ship was {{deployed}} with her sisters [...] and Tecumseh on the James River where they protected the transports of Major General Benjamin Butler's Army of the James, supplying the army as it operated on the south bank of the river during the Bermuda Hundred Campaign. On 21 June, Commander Craven of the Tecumseh spotted a line of breastworks that the Confederates were building at Howlett's Farm and his ship opened fire at the workers. The Confederates replied with a battery of four guns near the breastworks and Saugus and Canonicus joined in the bombardment. A half-hour later, Confederate ships near Dutch Gap joined in, but their fire was ineffective because they were firing blindly at the Union monitors. During the engagement, Canonicus fired forty 15-inch shells and was hit twice by Confederate shells. One shell pierced {{the upper part of the}} funnel and the other struck the deck and ricocheted into the turret; no one was wounded or killed during the engagement. The ship duelled with Howlett's Battery on 5 and 6 December, firing 46 shells without being hit in return. The only damage sustained was from the muzzle blast of the right gun that forced the armor <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> port out about [...] and broke a number of bolts.|$|E
500|$|Monitors turret {{measured}} [...] {{in diameter}} and [...] high, constructed with [...] of armor (11 inches in front <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> ports) rendering the overall vessel somewhat top heavy. Its rounded shape helped to deflect cannon shot. A pair of donkey engines rotated the turret {{through a set of}} gears; a full rotation was made in 22.5 seconds during testing on 9 February 1862. Fine control of the turret proved to be difficult as the engine would have to be placed in reverse if the turret overshot its mark or another full rotation could be made. The only way to see out of the turret was through the gun ports; when the guns were not in use, or withdrawn for reloading during battle, heavy iron port stoppers would swing down into place to close the gunports. Including the guns, the turret weighed approximately the entire weight rested on an iron spindle that had to be jacked up using a wedge before the turret could rotate. The spindle was [...] in diameter which gave it ten times the strength needed in preventing the turret from sliding sideways. When not in use, the turret rested on a brass ring on the deck that was intended to form a watertight seal. In service, however, this proved to leak heavily, despite caulking by the crew. [...] The gap between the turret and the deck proved to be a problem as debris and shell fragments entered the gap and jammed the turrets of several s, which used the same turret design, during the First Battle of Charleston Harbor in April 1863. Direct hits at the turret with heavy shot also had the potential to bend the spindle, which could also jam the turret. To gain access to the turret from below, or to hoist up powder and shot during battle, the turret had to rotate facing directly to starboard, which would line up the entry hatch in the floor of the turret with an opening in the deck below. The roof of the turret was lightly built to facilitate any needed exchange of the ship's guns and to improve ventilation, with only gravity holding the roof plates in place.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Type 38 gun had a conical interrupted-thread breech, {{a single}} box type trail which limited gun elevation to only 16°30'. Also, {{there were no}} equilibrators as the trunnions were <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> barrel's center of [...] balance. All of these shortcomings were remedied with a redesign following World War I.|$|E
60|$|In {{warm weather}} this pastime <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> is {{exceedingly}} unpleasant, {{to say the}} least, and throws a quiet man into a violent passion and perspiration. For one, I ever abominated it.|$|R
60|$|This {{was evidently}} the captain's opinion also, for during <b>the</b> day <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> were overhauled, and their {{carriages}} examined, and the muskets {{brought up on}} deck and cleaned. On the following day the men were practised <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns,</b> and then had pike and cutlass exercise.|$|R
60|$|Still {{no reply}} was made. <b>The</b> men <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> fidgeted, and kept casting glances towards the poop, in {{expectation}} of an order. It came at last, {{but was not}} what they had expected.|$|R
2500|$|With {{only two}} rounds {{left and the}} last three M13/40s {{pressing}} on, Lieutenant Toms left the gun to drive a Jeep to the nearest knocked-out gun for ammunition and arrived back <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> through machine-gun fire, which set the petrol tank alight. Turner and an NCO rushed over to help unload the Jeep, by when the tanks were [...] away, firing machine-guns <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> crew. Sergeant Calistan, the gun-layer, hit the three tanks and set them on fire, from which none of the crews escaped. After the attack, a lull fell apart from shelling which caused more casualties. Turner had been wounded unloading the Jeep but visited the gun positions, until effect of his wounds became too serious; by [...] most of the officers were casualties and the guns were commanded by wounded NCOs. Briggs ordered forward the 2nd Armoured Brigade artillery, the 11th RHA and they drove their M7 Priests up {{the east side of}} the ridge, to bombard Axis positions but managed to hit Snipe again, with 105 mm howitzer fire.|$|E
2500|$|At [...] "Bloody Gulch", {{the name}} {{given by the}} troops {{to the scene of}} the {{successful}} enemy attack, the 555th Field Artillery on August 12 lost all eight of its howitzers in the two firing batteries there. The 90th Field Artillery Battalion lost all six 155mm howitzers of its A Battery. The day after the North Korean attack, only 20 percent of the battalion troops were present for duty. The battalion estimated at the time that from 75 to 100 artillerymen were killed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> positions and 80 wounded, with many of the latter unable to get away. The 90th Field Artillery Battalion lost 10 men killed, 60 wounded, and about 30 missing at Bloody Gulch—more than half the men of Headquarters and A Batteries present.|$|E
2500|$|Post First World War German {{fighters were}} fitted with {{electrical}} synchronizers. [...] In such a gear, a contact {{or set of}} contacts, either on the propeller shaft itself, or some {{other part of the}} drive train revolving at the same number of revolutions per minute, generates a series of electrical pulses, which are transmitted to a solenoid driven trigger motor <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun.</b> Experiments with these were underway {{before the end of the}} war, and again the LVG company seems to have been involved: a British intelligence report from 25 June 1918 mentions an LVG two-seater fitted with such a gear that was brought down in the British lines. It is known that LVG built 40 C.IV two-seaters fitted with a Siemens electrical synchronizing system.|$|E

5000|$|A {{well trained}} battery could observe, plot, adjust, and {{transmit}} the firing data to its guns, which {{could then be}} loaded and laid, all before the next 20-second bell, <b>at</b> which point <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> would be fired. If {{for some reason the}} firing data were not received in time by <b>the</b> <b>guns,</b> or if a hold-up or a misfire occurred, then firing happened <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the following interval. In such a case, the command [...] "Relay!" [...] (re-lay) was given <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns.</b>|$|R
60|$|The battery, indeed, {{soon began}} to fire again, irregularly, as <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> were loaded. <b>The</b> shot tore up the water ahead and astern of the boats, but {{it was evident that}} those <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> could not make out their precise position.

2500|$|The attack {{further north}} {{was much more}} successful. In XVIII Corps, the 48th Division {{attacked}} at [...] with one brigade, capturing Border House and gun pits {{either side of the}} north-east bearing St Julien–Winnipeg road, where they were held up by machine-gun fire and a small counter-attack. The capture of St Julien was completed and the infantry consolidated along a line from Border House, to Jew Hill, the gun pits and St Julien. The troops were fired on from Maison du Hibou and Hillock Farm, which was captured soon after, then British troops seen advancing on Springfield Farm disappeared. At [...] German troops gathered around Triangle Farm and at [...] made a counter-attack which was repulsed. Another German attack after dark was defeated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> pits and at [...] another German counter-attack from Triangle Farm was repulsed.|$|E
2500|$|The patent was {{published}} in the German aviation magazine Flugsport in 1914 so that it was effectively [...] "public property" [...] from the beginning. Interestingly, the linkage between the propeller and the gun is achieved with a spinning drive shaft rather than a reciprocating rod. The impulses needed to operate the trigger, or in this case to prevent the trigger from operating, were produced by a cam wheel with two lobes at 180° apart situated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> itself, since the gun is interrupted by both blades of the propeller. No attempt was made (so far as is known) to build or test an actual operating gear based on this patent, which attracted little or no official interest at the time. The exact form of the synchronization gear fitted to Schneider's LVG E.I of 1915, and its relationship to this patent, is unknown, since no plans survive.|$|E

2500|$|The 48th Division {{consolidated}} on a {{line from}} the village to the gun pits, Jew Hill and Border House. At [...] German troops massed around Triangle Farm and made an abortive counter-attack at [...] Another counter-attack after dark was repulsed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> pits and at [...] a counter-attack from Triangle Farm was repulsed. The Germans in Maison du Hibou and Triangle Farm opposite the 48th Division caught the right of the 34th Brigade of the 11th Division in enfilade fire as it was fired on from pillboxes to the front. The British captured Haanixbeer Farm and the cemetery but lost the barrage and were unable to capture the Cockcroft and Bülow Farm. On the left, the brigade dug in [...] north-east of Langemarck opposite the White House and Pheasant Farm and on the right dug in facing Maison du Hibou and Triangle Farm to the east. With observation from higher ground to the east, German artillery fire inflicted many casualties on the British troops holding the new line beyond Langemarck.|$|E
2500|$|The main gun turrets were {{relatively}} lightly protected {{in comparison to}} contemporary battleships. Maximum turret and barbette armour was reduced to 12.75inches in this class from the 16inches of the Nelson class. The turret faces had 12.75 in (324mm) of armour at the front; [...] sides (<b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> chamber); 6.86inches (284–174mm) on the sides and rear; the roof plate was 5.88 in (149mm) thick. The main armament barbettes were of varying thickness: 12.75in (324mm) thick on the sides, 11.76in (298mm) forward and 10.82in (275mm) aft of the turret. To some extent the higher quality of the armour minimized the loss of protection and the turret's flat face improved ballistic resistance at long ranges, while the low profile of the turret minimized target area at closer ranges. The reduction in turret and barbette armour was a compromise in favour of the thickest possible protection for the magazines. The extensive anti-flash protection in the turrets and barbettes was designed {{to ensure that the}} magazines would remain safe even if the turrets and/or barbettes were penetrated. The secondary gun mounts, casements and handling rooms received only light plating of 0.98in (25mm) to protect against splinters.|$|E
