5|$|James {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent at 12:01am EDT on July 1, 2010. During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers. On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision {{that he would}} sign with the Heat. The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities. The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade had also announced that they would sign with Miami; reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies. James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part {{so that he could}} shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. Heat president Pat Riley {{played a major role in}} selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade. James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.|$|E
5|$|The German {{troops were}} {{reluctant}} to attack head on once again, and Sergeant Vinz Kulbach pleaded with the officers of the 9th Fallschirmjäger Regiment to allow his men to flank the Americans in the dusk. Fifty men from Fusilier Regiment 27 of the 12th Volksgrenadier Division were dispatched to attack the American's southern flank through the woods. Just as Bouck was about to blow his whistle to indicate withdrawal, German soldiers penetrated their lines and began overrunning their foxholes. Several attackers were killed by grenades rigged to wires and triggered by Americans in their foxholes. Each of the positions spread out over the ridge top were overrun in turn. Surprisingly, the Germans did not simply kill the defenders in their foxholes. Bouck was pulled from his foxhole by an officer with a machine gun, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would be shot when the German put his weapon in his back and pulled the trigger; it was empty. Both Bouck and the German officer were then struck by bullets. The German fell seriously wounded, while Bouck was struck in the calf. Sergeant Kuhlbach asked Bouck who was in command, and Bouck replied that he was. Kuhlbach asked him why the Americans were still shooting, and Bouck {{said it was not}} his men doing it. Bouck surrendered and helped carry his wounded men down to the village.|$|E
25|$|The first-century Roman-Jewish scholar Josephus {{wrote that}} Korah was an Israelite of {{principal}} account, both {{by family and}} wealth, {{who was able to}} speak well and could easily persuade the people. Korah envied the great dignity of Moses, as he was of the same tribe as Moses <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> better deserved honor on account of his great riches.|$|E
60|$|Lancelot <b>thought</b> so too, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> {{knew the}} cause of it.|$|R
60|$|Then {{our friend}} rose <b>and</b> said <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> {{would give it}} up and go home.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>and</b> {{little by}} little a plan worked out in his little black head. Then he chuckled. He chuckled right out loud, then hurriedly looked {{around to see if}} any one had heard him. No one had, so he chuckled again. He cocked his head on one side and half closed his eyes, as if that plan was {{something}} <b>he</b> could see <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was looking at it very hard. Then he cocked his head {{on the other side and}} did the same thing.|$|R
25|$|The use of guns in Noten's work {{came about}} by chance. In the past Noten had felt {{uneasy about the}} large number of people in his {{neighbourhood}} that carried guns. Whenever he could he would ask people to give him their gun or he would buy it from them. He would then throw it away or keep it in store without any particular purpose for it. After a while he had quite a collection <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> might just as well use these guns in his works of art. It also gave him the idea of a project he called Design Against Crime in which he collaborated with the authorities to persuade people to give up their guns in return for a work of art.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer and {{directed}} by David Silverman. It was the first script Meyer wrote on the show, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> made [...] "quite a few mistakes, {{but it turned out}} really well overall." [...] The staff decided to do a Thanksgiving episode after they found out that an episode would air on Thursday, November 22, 1990, the date of Thanksgiving that year. The Simpsons had previously aired at 8:00p.m. EST on Sunday night but the Fox network switched its timeslot to the same time on Thursdays {{at the beginning of the}} second season. The idea of Bart going up on the roof was suggested by Meyer who used to go up on the roof himself when he had fights with his family.|$|E
500|$|On his Beats 1 {{radio show}} [...] "The Pharmacy" [...] on August 1, 2015, Dre {{announced}} that he would release what would be his final album, titled Compton. It is inspired by the N.W.A biopic Straight Outta Compton and is a compilation-style album, featuring a number of frequent collaborators, including Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar, Xzibit and The Game, among others. It was released exclusively for iTunes and Apple Music on August 7. A physical version was published on August 21. In an interview with Rolling Stone, he revealed that he had about 20 to 40 tracks for Detox but he didn't release it because it didn't meet his standards <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was done being an artist. He also revealed that he suffers from social anxiety and due to this he remains secluded and out of attention.|$|E

500|$|Jourdan {{considered}} his position {{superior to the}} Austrian's, protected as he was by the marshy plain between his positions and the Austrian front, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had another three days to consolidate his positions. His forces occupied Hoßkirch, {{and a couple of}} other points he considered strategic: the causeway (post road) that passed Saulgau (today Bad Saulgau), the village of Altshausen [...] east, and the hamlet of Friedberg, [...] to the north-north-east of Ostrach. These positions created a perimeter around Ostrach. He was unaware that the Archduke had arrived by forced marches from Augsburg to the vicinity of Ostrach; Jourdan thought the main force of Charles' army was still at least three days' march away. [...] By the middle of Holy Week in 1799, more than a third of Charles' army, 48,000mixed troops, was positioned in a formation parallel to Jourdan's, and his 72,000remaining troops were arrayed with the left wing at Kempten, the center near Memmingen, and the right flank extended to Ulm.|$|E
500|$|More {{than two}} weeks before the 2008 NFL Draft, the Miami Dolphins, who owned the right to make the first {{selection}} in the draft determined that they wanted to negotiate with Long to be their pick and met with Tom Condon, Long's sports agent. [...] On April 22, 2008, in advance of the April 26 and 27 draft, Long agreed to a five-year, $57.75 million deal with the Miami Dolphins. The deal included $30 million in guaranteed money and made Long the first overall pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. This made him, as of that date, the highest paid offensive lineman in NFL history. At Dolphins minicamp on May 2, Long was assigned number 79 <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would have to negotiate with Drew Mormino for the number 77 that he had worn since high school. [...] However, after he failed his physical exam, Mormino was released from the team, and before training camp Long was assigned number 77.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "polarised" [...] {{motor car}} had been unsuccessfully tried in the Antarctic by Shackleton, on his 1907–09 expedition, while his {{pioneering}} use of ponies had transported him {{as far as the}} foot of the Beardmore Glacier. Scott believed that ponies had served Shackleton well, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> could resolve the motor traction problem by developing a tracked snow [...] "motor" [...] (the forerunner of the Snowcat and of the tank). However, Scott always intended to rely on man-hauling for the polar plateau, believing it impossible to ascend the Beardmore Glacier with motors or with animals. The motors and animals would be used to haul loads only across the Barrier, enabling the men to preserve their strength for the later Glacier and Plateau stages. In practice, the motor sledges proved only briefly useful, and the ponies' performance was affected by their age and poor condition. As to dogs, while Scott's experiences on Discovery had made him dubious of their reliability, his writings show that he recognised their effectiveness in the right hands. As the expedition developed, he became increasingly impressed with their capabilities.|$|E
60|$|Godfrey woke {{again to}} find himself lying upon a flat piece of snow. Recollection {{came back to him}} with a pang, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> must have fallen.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>he</b> {{honestly}} <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was, too; <b>and</b> so <b>he</b> {{had no one}} {{to blame}} but himself when his voice caught on the center occasionally and gave him the lockjaw.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is on his}} death-bed, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> had behaved {{badly to}} her. She did go to Bragton the other day, at his request,--merely that she might say that she forgave him." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1947, Laurel {{returned}} to England {{when he and}} Hardy went on a six-week tour of the United Kingdom, and the duo were mobbed wherever they went. Laurel's homecoming to Ulverston took place in May, and the duo were greeted by thousands of fans outside the Coronation Hall. The Evening Mail noted: [...] "Oliver Hardy remarked to our reporter that Stan had talked about Ulverston for the past 22 years <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had to see it." [...] The tour included a Royal Command Performance for King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in London. The success of the tour led them {{to spend the next}} seven years touring the UK and Europe.|$|E
2500|$|... ' no more justifiable insurrection had, in his judgement, {{taken place}} {{in the history of the}} world than the Irish {{rebellion}} of a hundred years ago. A rebel was a patriot who failed – a patriot was a rebel who succeeded, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> did not misinterpret the spirit of that assembly if he said they were ready to toast the men of '98 in either capacity. He should never cease to be grateful to the United Irishmen, not only because they had bequeathed an example of courageous patriotism, but because they had given them one cardinal principle of high policy, and that was the principle of a united Ireland. He trusted that this memorable year would not be allowed to pass away without renewed efforts being made to restore union in the National Union, at present so unhappily divided.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Working with Bing Crosby {{proved to}} be {{problematic}} from the start. Between scenes he barely interacted with leading lady Joan Fontaine, on loan from RKO Radio Pictures, who later recalled, [...] "Crosby wasn't very courteous to me ... There was never the usual costar rapport. I was a star at that time, but he treated me like he'd never heard of me." [...] The singer tended to ignore his director as well. According to Fontaine, [...] "It wasn't that he had anything against Mr. Wilder. He just didn't {{pay much attention to}} him. He told me once that he had some trouble understanding his funny accent." [...] Worst of all, Crosby tended to alter his dialogue, saying it [...] "as he felt it at the moment," [...] and Wilder was known for insisting his lines be delivered exactly as written. [...] "Bing Crosby operated for himself, not for the group or the film," [...] Wilder recalled. [...] "He was a big star, the biggest, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> knew what was good for him." ...|$|E
60|$|Some {{critical}} spirit {{within him}} asked him urgently {{why he was}} going to the station, what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was doing, what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had done, <b>and</b> what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was going to do. To all of which questions Mr. Brumley perceived he had no adequate reply.|$|R
6000|$|... "He paused, {{and seemed}} to be puzzling it out. Then <b>he</b> smiled knowingly, <b>and</b> said <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> {{understood}} what I meant. It was very kind of me. He should put every dollar he possessed in the Terra del Fuego Nitrate Company.|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked about}} whether he had ever intuited the truth, Gould said that he [...] "just chalked {{everything}} up to the oddities of reality television" [...] <b>and</b> that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> [...] "was on the weirdest reality show in history of mankind." ...|$|R
