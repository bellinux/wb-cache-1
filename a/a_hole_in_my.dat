25|$|The Flanders and Swann {{numbers in}} the two shows worked so well that Lister invited the pair to write much of his next revue, Airs on a Shoestring (1953). Their topics ranged from {{economics}} and politics ("There's <b>a</b> <b>Hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Budget") to a plaintive song about London's last tram ("Last of the Line") to a send-up of Benjamin Britten's works to date ("Guide to Britten"). In the same year Flanders wrote the libretto for a short opera by Antony Hopkins, Three's Company. They followed this up the next year with A Christmas Story. Also in 1954 Flanders, in partnership with Kitty Black (1914–2006), translated Stravinsky's Histoire du soldat for the Edinburgh Festival. The work played to capacity audiences in Edinburgh, and again in London at the Royal Festival Hall in 1956 with Flanders as the narrator, Sir Ralph Richardson as the Soldier and Peter Ustinov as the Devil. The translation has held its place as the standard English version into the 21st century.|$|E
500|$|The Nemesis of Faith {{also drew}} {{criticism}} on literary grounds as being melodramatic and sentimental. Froude himself {{wrote to his}} friend Charles Kingsley that [...] "I cut <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart and wrote with the blood". Thomas Carlyle complained of the novel [...] "Froude ought to consume his own smoke and not trouble other people's nostrils." [...] Although recent critics {{tend to be more}} positive about the novel's depiction of Sutherland's speculative crisis, they have maintained the weakness of the ending, attributing it to Froude's inability {{to come to terms with}} his own doubts.|$|E
500|$|In February 1967, Smith {{released}} an album on RCA Camden entitled Connie in the Country, which mainly featured cover versions of country hits recorded at the time, including songs by Loretta Lynn and Buck Owens. In May 1967 Smith {{released an}} album of songs written entirely by Bill Anderson entitled Connie Smith Sings Bill Anderson. Smith later commented that, [...] "...it was an honor, not a favor" [...] to record {{an album of}} all Bill Anderson songs. Included in the album was covers of Anderson's own hits such as [...] "City Lights" [...] and [...] "That's What It's Like to Be Lonesome". Also featured was Anderson's [...] "I Love You Drops", which Smith wanted to release as a single; however Anderson wanted to release the song as his own single. Smith stated, [...] "We begged him for that song. But I cut 33 of his songs." [...] It would later become a top ten hit for Anderson. Between 1966 and 1968, Smith had five top ten singles in a row on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart: [...] "I'll Come Running" [...] (which Smith wrote herself), [...] "Cincinnati, Ohio", [...] "Burning <b>a</b> <b>Hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Mind", [...] "Baby's Back Again", and [...] "Run Away Little Tears". [...] "Cincinnati, Ohio" [...] would later inspire the city of Cincinnati, Ohio to declare their own [...] "Connie Smith Day" [...] in June 1967.|$|E

2500|$|The series {{frequently}} {{makes use}} of Gene Hunt's comical rudeness {{in the form of}} jokes and dramatic irony about a future which the audience already knows, but which the characters in 1973 do not.

2500|$|Harry Belafonte, another {{influential}} performer, {{inspired in}} part by Paul Robeson started {{his career as a}} club singer in New York to pay for his acting classes. In 1952, he signed a contract with RCA Victor and released his first record album, Mark Twain and Other Folk Favorites. His breakthrough album Calypso (1956) was the first LP to sell over a million copies. The album spent 31 weeks at number one, 58 weeks in the top ten, and 99 weeks on the US charts. [...] It introduced American audiences to Calypso music and Belafonte was dubbed the [...] "King of Calypso." [...] Belafonte went on to record in many genres, including blues, American folk, gospel, and more. In 1959, he starred in Tonight With Belafonte a nationally televised special, that introduced Odetta in her debut to a prime time audience. She sang [...] "Water Boy" [...] and [...] performed a duet with Belafonte of [...] "There's <b>a</b> <b>Hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Bucket" [...] that hit the national charts in 1961.|$|E

Two live albums, both recorded at Carnegie Hall in 1959 and 1960, enjoyed critical and commercial success. From his 1959 album, [...] "Hava Nagila" [...] became part of his regular routine {{and one of his}} signature songs. He was one of many entertainers recruited by Frank Sinatra to perform at the inaugural gala of President John F. Kennedy in 1961. That same year he released his second calypso album, Jump Up Calypso, which went on to become another million seller. During the 1960s he introduced several artists to American audiences, most notably South African singer Miriam Makeba and Greek singer Nana Mouskouri. His album Midnight Special (1962) included a young harmonica player named Bob Dylan.|$|E

500|$|In the children's {{literature}} journal The ALAN Review {{published by}} The Assembly on Literature for Adolescents, Edgar H. Thompson, Connie B. Blevins, and Allison Fitzgerald argued that protagonist Marty [...] "consistently behaves" [...] at levels 5 and 6 of Kohlberg's stages of development. For instance, on his walk to Judd's house, he wonders: [...] "Easy as pie for Judd Travers to put <b>a</b> bullet <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head, say he didn't see me." [...] Despite his fears, Marty continues walking to Judd's house, persistent on protecting Shiloh despite potential bodily harm {{and even death}} to himself. The authors brooded over whether an 11 year old could attain such an elevated level despite most adults' never {{being able to do}} so. Ultimately noting that the Newbery Committee and thousands of readers consider Marty to be realistic, they concluded that Marty is a positive role model for children to strive to be.|$|R

[...] When radio stations preferred [...] "Deep Purple," [...] Ertegun relented, and so [...] "I've Been Carrying A Torch ..."

5000|$|There {{was some}} {{skepticism}} in the company's phenomenal growth internationally.
