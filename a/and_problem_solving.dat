5|$|NEPA {{has been}} emulated, {{in one form}} or another, by more than one hundred other countries, and many states have also {{established}} “mini NEPAs.” When national government agencies first started to prepare EISs, there were no professional associations dedicated to the planning <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> that NEPA demanded. Subsequently, Caldwell's efforts in formulating NEPA, and later promoting it, led to formation of the National Association of Environmental Professionals (NAEP), a national professional association of persons who prepare EISs.|$|E

Coon emphasized a balance between the shop and the classroom. Coon taught his students more modern quantification methods to solve engineering problems instead of outdated and more costly trial and error methods. He also {{played a significant role in}} developing mechanical engineering into a professional degree program, with a focus on ethics, design and testing, analysis <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> <b>solving,</b> and mathematics.|$|E

5|$|The {{executive}} {{function of the}} brain is the set of cognitive processes that allow the cognitive control of behavior: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions include the ability to filter information and tune out irrelevant stimuli with attentional control and cognitive inhibition, the ability to process and manipulate information held in working memory, {{the ability to think}} about multiple concepts simultaneously and switch tasks with cognitive flexibility, the ability to inhibit impulses and prepotent responses with inhibitory control, and the ability to determine the relevance of information or appropriateness of an action.

One hundred and fifty-five male and female students, {{between the ages of}} 16 and 24 years completed the Self-Esteem Inventory <b>and</b> the <b>Problem</b> <b>Solving</b> Inventory {{at the beginning of the}} semester, after an adventure experience weekend, and at the end of the semester. A group of seventy-seven first year social science students, serving as a control group, also completed the inventories on the same time schedule. Self-esteem <b>and</b> perceived <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> ability scores were analyzed by two one-way (treatment versus control) repeated measures (three assessments times) ANOVAs. Correlations between the two measures were also computed. Results indicated significant (p $<$. 05) interactions of group by time for both self-esteem <b>and</b> perceived <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> ability <b>and</b> significant correlations. Further analysis showed the Explorations II program was effective at increasing self-esteem <b>and</b> perceived <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> ability <b>and</b> that these two constructs are related.

40|$|An {{integrative}} {{model in}} which perfectionism <b>and</b> social <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> were hypothesized to have additive and interactive effects in predicting psychological maladjustment (viz., depressive symptoms and suicide ideation) was proposed and tested {{in a sample of}} 371 college students. Results of hierarchical regression analyses indicated that social <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> added significant incremental validity in predicting scores on measures of depressive symptoms and suicide ideation beyond what was accounted for by perfectionism. Moreover, a significant Perfectionism × Social <b>Problem</b> <b>Solving</b> interaction was found in predicting each of the maladjustment measures after accounting for the influences of both perfectionism <b>and</b> social <b>problem</b> <b>solving.</b> These results are taken to provide preliminary support for an additive and interactive prediction model of psychological maladjustment involving perfectionism <b>and</b> social <b>problem</b> <b>solving...</b>|$|R
