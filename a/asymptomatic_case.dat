40|$|An <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>case</b> {{of severe}} acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) occurred early in 2004, during a community outbreak of SARS in Guangzhou, China. This {{was the first}} time that a case of asymptomatic SARS was noted in an individual with antigenemia and seroconversion. The <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>case</b> patient and the second index case patient with SARS in the 2003 - 2004 outbreak both worked in the same restaurant, where they served palm civets, which were found to carry SARS-associated coronaviruses. Epidemiological information and laboratory findings suggested that the findings for the patient with asymptomatic infection, together with the findings from previously reported serological analyses of handlers of wild animals and the 4 index case patients from the 2004 community outbreak, reflected a likely intermediate phase of animal-to-human transmission of infection, rather than a case of human-to-human transmission. This intermediate phase may be a critical stage for virus evolution and disease prevention. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract INTRODUCTION: Paraguay {{was among}} the 16 {{countries}} that reported zero indigenous malaria cases in 2014. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational descriptive study was performed in 100 adults from Santa Teresa, Paraguay. Parasite detection was carried out using seminested multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microscopy. RESULTS Among the participants, 44 % were female and 56 % were male, and 89 % had a malaria history. No parasites were detected with either of the methods. CONCLUSIONS: There were no <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>cases</b> in Santa Teresa, and this finding is very promising. A longitudinal study should be performed to confirm {{that there are no}} <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>cases</b> in this locality...|$|R

Although no treatment is necessary for a benign <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>case,</b> in case of erosive lichen planus, topical corticosteroids form the mainstay of treatment.

In this study, we report an <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>case</b> of humeral head OCD, which was detected incidentally following a trauma. X-rays showed an area of lucency around an oval bony fragment measuring about 1 cm on the superior aspect of the humeral head.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study was twofold: survey samples from acute and chronic endodontic infections for the {{presence}} of genes encoding resistance to beta-lactams, tetracycline and erythromycin, and evaluate the ability of treatment to eliminate these genes from root canals. DesignDNA extracts from samples of abscess aspirates (n= 25) and root canals of teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis (n= 24) were used as template for direct detection of the genes blaTEM, cfxA, tetM, tetQ, tetW, and ermC using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Bacterial presence was determined using PCR with universal bacterial primers. Root canals of the <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>cases</b> were also sampled and evaluated after chemomechanical procedures using NiTi instruments with 2. 5 % NaOCl irrigation. ResultsAll abscess and initial root canal samples were positive for bacteria. At least one of the target resistance genes was found in 36 % of the abscess samples and 67 % of the <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>cases.</b> The most prevalent genes in abscesses were blaTEM (24 %) and ermC (24 %), while tetM (42 %) and tetW (29 %) prevailed in <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>cases.</b> The blaTEM gene was significantly associated with acute cases (p= 0. 02). Conversely, tetM was significantly more prevalent in <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>cases</b> (p= 0. 008). Treatment eliminated resistance genes from most cases. ConclusionsAcute and chronic endodontic infections harboured resistance genes for 3 classes of widely used antibiotics. In most cases, treatment was effective in eliminating these genes, but there were a few cases in which they persisted. The implications of persistence are unknown. Direct detection of resistance genes in abscesses may be a potential method for rapid diagnosis and establishment of proactive antimicrobial therapy...|$|R

40|$|Human {{rotavirus}} isolates from 1100 stool {{samples were}} analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and 48 different migration patterns were detected. Heterogeneity in the migration of segment 10 was observed in both long and short electropherotypes in which three long and two short patterns were identified. In spite of these variations all short and long electropherotypes were subgrouped by enzyme immunoassay as subgroups I and II respectively. Mixed infections were detected in 17 % of cases and the subgrouping correlated with the corresponding electropherotypes. The same electropherotypes were present in severe, mild and <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>cases</b> and no electropherotype was particularly associated with greater virulence. Furthermore, the electropherotypes isolated from nosocomial <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>cases</b> {{were the same as}} those detected from those admitted with severe diarrhea.

At first, this complication was managed conservatively, however, a lead perforation progressively developed and, as a result, open surgery was performed to remove the lead.

40|$|We {{report a}} patient who had a low plasma ACTH level without any symptoms. A 43 -year-old female was {{admitted}} to our hospital for further evaluation of adrenal enlargement.

Daily profiles of plasma cortisol level, dexamethasone suppressing test, and pituitary function tests were within normal limits. However, plasma ACTH level was increased to the normal range after the adding of polyethylene glycol to the plasma. These data suggest that low plasma ACTH level was induced by the anti-intrinsic ACTH antibody.
