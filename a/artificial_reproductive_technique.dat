40|$|In Nolan v. LaBree, {{a husband}} and wife filed a {{complaint}} seeking a judgment declaring their legal parentage of a newborn child born via gestational surrogacy. All parties surrounding the birth of this child entered into a surrogacy contract and are in agreement that the genetic mother and father bringing this suit should be declared as the legal parents. When the child was born, however, the birth certificate did not reflect the intentions of the contract, listing the parents as the surrogate mother and the surrogate mother’s spouse. The trial court, following an uncontested hearing, declared the requested paternity determination but held there was no statutory authority permitting a similar determination of maternity and, therefore, declined to make such a declaration. The plaintiffs appealed to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, sitting as the Law Court, contending that the trial court erred in its aforementioned denial of maternity declaration based on lack of statutory authority. This case brought an important issue to the Law Court regarding parentage in <b>artificial</b> <b>reproductive</b> <b>technique</b> births. The issue invited the Law Court to determine the judicial remedy with respect to parentage when a child is born via gestational surrogacy, where the legislature has avoided such controversial topics, creating uncertainty for both courts and families in Maine. The Law court in Nolan interprets the sparse statutory language in a way that ultimately provides for a declaration of parental in the case at hand, but the question becomes: is it enough? This Note considers whether the Law Court’s rationale and narrow holding, interpreting statutory language as providing power to the courts to determine and declare both paternity and maternity following a birth via surrogacy, is adequate, or whether the legislature should take further action to provide concrete guidance to both families and courts involving surrogacy arrangements where all parties are in accord as to the identity of the intended parents. This Note next reviews the development of surrogacy agreements and private ordering in family law within the jurisdictions that have addressed the issue. It moves on to reveal and contrast the multifarious approaches taken by different states. This Note then discusses the treatment of such agreements in Maine, ultimately revealing the lack of attention given to the area surrounding artificial reproductive techniques. This Note recognizes the unwillingness to adopt comprehensive legislation on the topic but suggest that the issues, once deemed controversial, are less controversial today and a course of action must be embarked upon to keep pace with societal changes and scientific developments. The ultimate recommendation proffered by this Note is to take the first step down this path of modernizing Maine law by minimal legislative action permitting courts to validate certain gestational surrogacy agreements, which would in turn have the effect of automatically terminating the parental rights of the surrogate and her husband, if any, upon the child’s birth...|$|E

Materials and Methods: Between March 2009 and January 2010, 10 patients underwent robot-assisted tubal ligation reversal (TLR) with a da Vinci S surgical system. Patient demographic data, including operative times, operative and postoperative complications, hospital stay, conversion to laparotomy and pregnancy rates were recorded. Results: Mean age and body mass index for the patients were 37. 7 (35 – 42) years and 28. 9 (23. 9 – 36. 3)  kg/m 2, respectively. The mean console time was 102. 5  min and the mean total operation time was 130. 6 (102 – 164)  min. The mean hospital stay was 1. 2 (1 – 2) days. There were no significant intra-operative or early-postoperative complications. All surgeries were completed robotically with no conversion to laparotomy. There were seven subsequent pregnancies in the study participants, representing a pregnancy rate of 70 %, of which five were intrauterine pregnancies, one was an ectopic pregnancy, and one was an abortus.

INTERVENTION(S) : Blood and semen analyses {{before the start of}} cART and 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks thereafter. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : We examined the effect of cART on semen parameters by a repeated measurements procedure using a mixed-effects model.

We used the mouse model to investigate mechanisms of action of ATPe on sperm. ATPe treatment significantly enhanced IVF success as indicated by both rate of pronuclear formation and percentage cleavage to the 2 -cell stage. However, ATPe did not increase the percentage of sperm undergoing spontaneous acrosomal exocytosis nor change the pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation normally observed in capacitated sperm. ATPe altered sperm motility parameters; in particular, both noncapacitated and capacitated sperm swam faster and straighter. The percentage of hyper-activated sperm did not increase in capacitated ATPe-treated sperm compared to control sperm. ATPe induced a rapid {{increase in the level}} of intracellular calcium that was inhibited by two distinct P 2 purinergic receptor inhibitors, confirming that these receptors have an ionotropic role in sperm function.

In this project, the potential {{long-term effects of}} intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) were assessed in 5 – 8 -year-old singleton children. ICSI is the method of artificial reproduction in which a sperm cel is injected into an oocyte using a microinjection pipette. The technique is mainly successful in overcoming male factor infertility. Concerns about the development and health of ICSI-children have existed since {{the introduction of the}} technique in 1992, because ICSI is more invasive than the more widespread technique of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In this project, 87 ICSI-children born as a singleton were compared with 87 singletons born after IVF and 85 singletons born after natural conception at 5 - 8 years of age, on various parameters: neuromotor development, cognitive development, pregnancy, perinatal outcome, congenital malformations, general health, growth, medical care utilisation, behaviour, parenting stress, and child quality of life. Although the results remain inconclusive on some outcomes, the majority of concerns regarding development and health of ICSI-children can be dispelled up to 8 years of age, in particular when ICSI is compared to IVF.

Using a bovine interspecies model with a single nucleotide polymorphism, we assessed the imprinting status of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (SNRPN) gene in bovine embryos produced by artificial insemination (AI), in vitro culture (IVF) and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) and correlated allelic expression with the DNA methylation patterns of a differentially methylated region (DMR) located on the SNRPN promoter. Results In the AI group, SNRPN maternal expression is silenced at day 17 and 40 of development {{and a third of}} the alleles analyzed are methylated in the DMR. In the IVF group, maternal transcripts were identified at day 17 but methylation levels were similar to the AI group. However, day- 40 fetuses in the IVF group showed significantly less methylation when compared to the AI group and SNRPN expression was mostly paternal in all fetal tissues studied, except in placenta.

The use of selection methods such as Androcoll could become an important tool {{to improve the quality}} of sperm samples and therefore to improve other <b>artificial</b> <b>reproductive</b> <b>techniques</b> such as sperm sex sorting, in vitro fertilization or AI. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a Single Layer Centrifugation with Androcoll-S on the sperm quality of red deer sperm samples of two different origins, electroejaculated samples and epididymal samples obtained post-mortem, after thawing and after an incubation for 2. h at 37. °C. Sperm motility, viability, membrane permeability, mitochondrial activity, acrosomal status and DNA fragmentation were determined for all samples. The samples selected by Androcoll-S showed an improvement in sperm kinematics compared to unselected samples after thawing and after incubation. The same effect was observed in parameters such as viability, mitochondrial activity or acrosomal status which were improved after the selection. In contrast, no difference was found in DNA fragmentation between selected and unselected samples within the same sperm type. We conclude that sperm selection by SLC with Androcoll-S after thawing for red deer sperm of both types is a suitable technique that allows sperm quality in both types of sperm samples to be improved, thereby improving other assisted <b>reproductive</b> <b>techniques.</b> Further studies (IVF and in vivo fertilization) are required to determine whether this improvement can increase fertility, as has been shown for other species.

Existing microdroplet analysis techniques are accurate and suitable for non-invasive assessment of single embryos. Unfortunately, the process of determining metabolite levels in nanoliters of culture media through fluorometric assays is low-throughput and requires specialized expertise, hindering widespread clinical use of these methods. The goal of this thesis is to develop microfluidics-based approaches for improving metabolic analysis of PI embryos and mammalian cells. This challenge necessitates two competencies: methods for automating chemical assays and methods for supporting cell cultures, which can be integrated with analysis. Contributions include a standalone platform for determining the metabolite use of single embryos. Profiles may be acquired automatically, which reduces significant technician hours and improves repeatability. Techniques are developed for performing embryo culture in the smallest culture volumes to date in microfabricated environments. Microfluidic approaches have enabled culture that outperforms the current state of art approach based on cell count measurements. (cont.) An integrated system is introduced, merging analysis and culture competencies to perform metabolic profiling of separate cultures of mammalian cells in parallel. Finally, new paradigms in microfluidic design are presented based on the concept of vertically integrated architectures, suitable for overcoming density limitations of microfluidic assays. A scalable analysis platform for refining embryo selection has been long warranted and would enable pursuit of the difficult questions relating metabolism and embryo viability as the clinical movement towards SET continues. by John Paul Urbanski.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of infertility, outcome of infertility investigation, and the treatment outcome of infertile couples following therapeutic interventions in southeast Nigeria over a 12 -month period. Methods: This was a prospective cross-sectional study of 218 consecutive infertile couples presenting for infertility management at the infertility clinics of two tertiary health institutions in Enugu, southeast Nigeria. Infertility investigations were carried out on these couples using the available conventional diagnostic facilities. Following the results of the investigations/diagnosis, conventional treatment was offered to the couples as appropriate. Data analysis was both descriptive and inferential at 95 % confidence level. Results: The mean age of the women was 33. 5 ± 4. 62 (range: 15 – 49) years. Most (58. 3 % [n= 127]) were nulliparous. The prevalence of infertility was 12. 1 %. Infertility was primary in 28. 4 % (n= 62) and secondary in 71. 6 % (n= 156). Female etiologic factors were responsible in 32. 1 % (n= 70), male factors in 26. 1 % (n= 57), and a combination of male/female factors in 29. 4 % (n= 64). The etiology was unknown in 12. 4 % (n= 27). Tubal factors 23. 8 % (n= 52) and ovulation failures 26. 1 % (n= 57) are common female factors implicated. Pregnancy rate following treatment was 16. 7 % (n= 28). Multivariate regression analysis indicates that younger age of ≤ 30 years, duration of infertility ≤ 5 years, and female factor infertility were associated with higher pregnancy outcome following treatment. Conclusion: The prevalence of infertility is high and pregnancy rate following conventional treatment is poor. There is a need to improve facilities for managing infertility as well as making <b>artificial</b> <b>reproductive</b> <b>techniques</b> readily available, accessible, and affordable.

40|$|BACKGROUND Endometriosis is {{a disease}} known to be {{detrimental}} to fertility. Women with endometriosis, {{and the presence of}} endometrioma, may require <b>artificial</b> <b>reproductive</b> <b>techniques</b> (ART) to achieve a pregnancy. The specific impact of endometrioma alone and the impact of surgical intervention for endometrioma on the reproductive outcome of women undergoing IVF/ICSI are areas that require further clarification. The objectives of this review were as follows: (i) to determine the impact of endometrioma on IVF/ICSI outcomes, (ii) to determine the impact of surgery for endometrioma on IVF/ICSI outcome and (iii) to determine the effect of different surgical techniques on IVF/ICSI outcomes. METHODS We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis examining subfertile women who have endometrioma and are undergoing IVF/ICSI, and who have or have not had any surgical management for endometrioma before IVF/ICSI. The primary outcome was live birth rate (LBR). Our secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy rate (CPR), mean number of oocyte retrieved (MNOR), miscarriage rate (MR), fertilization rate, implantation rate, antral follicle count (AFC), total stimulating hormone dose, and any rates of adverse effects such as cancellation and associated complications during the IVF/ICSI treatment. RESULTS We included 33 studies for the meta-analysis. The majority of the studies were retrospective (30 / 33), and three were RCTs. Compared with women with no endometrioma undergoing IVF/ICSI, women with endometrioma had a similar LBR (odds ratio [OR] 0. 98; 95 % CI [0. 71, 1. 36], 5 studies, 928 women, I 2 = 0 %) and a similar CPR (OR 1. 17; 95 % CI [0. 87, 1. 58], 5 studies, 928 women, I 2 = 0 %), a lower mean number of oocytes retrieved (SMD ? 0. 23; 95 % CI [? 0. 37, ? 0. 10], 5 studies, 941 cycles, I 2 = 37 %) and a higher cycle cancellation rate compared with those without the disease (OR 2. 83; 95 % CI [1. 32, 6. 06], 3 studies, 491 women, I 2 = 0 %). Compared with women with no surgical treatment, women who had their endometrioma surgically treated before IVF/ICSI had a similar LBR (OR 0. 90; 95 % CI [0. 63, 1. 28], 5 studies, 655 women, I 2 = 32 %), a similar CPR (OR 0. 97; 95 % CI [0. 78, 1. 20], 11 studies, 1512 women, I 2 = 0 %) and a similar mean number of oocytes retrieved (SMD ? 0. 17; 95 % CI [? 0. 38, 0. 05], 9 studies, 810 cycles, I 2 = 63 %). CONCLUSIONS Women with endometrioma undergoing IVF/ICSI had similar reproductive outcomes compared with those without the disease, although their cycle cancellation rate was significantly higher. Surgical treatment of endometrioma did not alter the outcome of IVF/ICSI treatment compared with those who did not receive surgical intervention. Considering that the reduced ovarian reserve may be attributed to the presence of endometrioma per se, and the potential detrimental impact from surgical intervention, individualization of care for women with endometrioma prior to IVF/ICSI may help optimize their IVF/ICSI results...|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} were to {{investigate}} characteristics {{of women and}} men who have their first baby at an advanced age, reasons for postponing childbirth, and consequences in terms of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Maternal age at first birth has increased in many modern societies; in both Sweden and Norway, first-time mothers are now about five years older, compared with the previous generation. This delaying of parenthood has been associated with an increased need for <b>artificial</b> <b>reproductive</b> <b>techniques</b> and adverse pregnancy outcomes, and it may also contribute to reduced fertility rates in a society. In Studies I and II, data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study were used, and the characteristics of 41 236 women and 14 832 men who had their first baby during the period 1999 - 2008 were investigated. Compared with younger reference groups (women aged 25 - 32 years; men aged 25 - 34 years), maternal age ≥ 33 years and paternal age ≥ 35 years were associated with fecundity problems and slightly more health problems and risky health behaviour. The vast majority of older first-time parents had a high level of education and annual income. However, a smaller group was socio-economically more disadvantaged with low level of education, single status, unemployment, unsatisfactory relationship with their partner and had an unplanned pregnancy. Studies III and IV were based on data from the Swedish Young Adult Panel Study and the Swedish Total Population Register. Reproductive intentions and reasons for not having children at the age of 28, 32 and 36 or 40 were investigated in 365 childless women and 356 childless men. Many overestimated their fecundity, and one in three women and men aged 36 or 40 years wished to have children. Reasons for remaining childless at these ages were: lack of partner, no desire for children, not feeling mature enough, and wanting to explore other aspects of life before having a family (III). Predictors of still being childless at the age of 32 were investigated in 22 -year-olds (518 women and 482 men). These predictors were: family background factors such as growing up in a large city, having highly educated parents, being an only child, still living in their original family, having a less than positive experience of their own mother and father as parents, an unsatisfactory relationship with their mother, and negative attitudes to children (IV). Study V was a population-based register study including 955 804 primiparous women from the Swedish and Norwegian Medical Birth Registers who gave birth during the period 1990 - 2010. The risk of preterm birth, infant small for gestation age, low Apgar score, stillbirth and neonatal death was investigated in women aged 30 - 34 years, 35 - 39 years and ≥ 40 years compared with women 25 - 29 years of age. Additionally, the risks associated with advanced maternal age were compared with those of smoking and being overweight or obese. The adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR) of all outcomes increased by maternal age in a similar way in Sweden and Norway, and there was a risk of fetal death already at the age of 30 - 34 years (Sweden aOR 1. 24; 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 1. 13 – 1. 37, Norway aOR 1. 26; 95 % CI 1. 12 – 1. 41). The Swedish data showed that maternal age ≥ 30 years was a risk associated with the same number of additional cases of fetal deaths (n= 251) as overweight/obesity (n= 251). In conclusion, this thesis confirms some of the findings from previous research regarding the selection of women who delay childbirth to advanced age, such as well- educated women and high-income earners. It adds information about the characteristics of first-time fathers and it also shows that a minority of first-time parents constitute a less advantaged group. The prospective longitudinal study suggests that, besides well- known factors, young persons’ experience of their own parents may have an impact on reproductive behaviour, especially the relationship with the mother. Finally, the thesis confirms the association between advanced maternal age and severe pregnancy outcomes, but adds to previous knowledge that risk may increase already at the age of 30 - 34 years...|$|R

Specificities of HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers and the hypothesis of a reduced fertility potential are discussed.
