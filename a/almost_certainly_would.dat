Filler makes the larger point that both the King and his wife were, in reality, lukewarm towards Churchill because of the latter's support for his brother during the abdication crisis. They only warmed to Churchill later in the war, because of his performance as a wartime leader.|$|E
5|$|Marochetti also pursued an {{abortive}} {{project to}} install a second giant equestrian statue in Old Palace Yard, this time portraying Edward, the Black Prince. He envisaged the two statues facing each other {{on either side of}} the entrance to the House of Lords. Although the scheme was reported in several journals, including the Illustrated London News, the Art Journal and the Athenaeum, and was strongly criticised for its perceived thematic inappropriateness, nothing came of it. Three different versions of the model for Marochetti's Black Prince came to light at the turn of the 21st century. They appear to have been designed at the same time as his Richard I, demonstrating their common origins; models of the two statues <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> have co-existed in his workshop and Marochetti probably intended to seek a commission from Prince Albert. However, the death of the Prince Consort in 1861 deprived him of his most influential patron, and Marochetti's own death was to follow in 1867. Queen Victoria purchased one of Marochetti's statuette versions of the Black Prince following the sculptor's death and gave it to her son Edward, Prince of Wales. It is still part of the Royal Collection.|$|E

25|$|Most of Gonzales's {{career as}} a {{professional}} took place {{before the start of}} the open era of tennis in April 1968, and he was therefore ineligible to compete at the Grand Slam events between the end of 1949 (when he turned pro) and the start of the open era in April 1968.

But international law does not work like that. Though it is no doubt deeply unsatisfying to Palestinians and their many supporters, the correct legal {{answer to the question of}} whether the 1947–49 refugees have a right of return under international law goes something like this: even if (or assuming that) the Israelis did intentionally expel every Palestinian refugee, it was not illegal when it occurred, though it <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> be if done today under the same circumstances; and the law at the time did not require repatriation of the refugees to Israel, though it most likely would if the expulsion were to occur today.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{emotions}} stirred by this task, Mary Shelley arguably proved herself {{in many respects}} a professional and scholarly editor. Working from Percy's messy, sometimes indecipherable, notebooks, she attempted to form a chronology for his writings, and she included poems, such as Epipsychidion, addressed to Emilia Viviani, which she would rather have left out. She was forced, however, into several compromises, and, as Blumberg notes, [...] "modern critics have found fault with the edition and claim variously that she miscopied, misinterpreted, purposely obscured, and attempted to turn the poet into something he was not". According to Wolfson, Donald Reiman, a modern editor of Percy Bysshe Shelley's works, still refers to Mary Shelley's editions, while acknowledging that her editing style belongs [...] "to an age of editing when the aim was not to establish accurate texts and scholarly apparatus but to present a full record of a writer's career for the general reader". In principle, Mary Shelley believed in publishing every last word of her husband's work; but she found herself obliged to omit certain passages, either by pressure from her publisher, Edward Moxon, or in deference to public propriety. For example, she removed the atheistic passages from Queen Mab for the first edition. After she restored them in the second edition, Moxon was prosecuted and convicted of blasphemous libel, though he escaped punishment. Mary Shelley's omissions provoked criticism, often stinging, from members of Percy Shelley's former circle, and reviewers accused her of, among other things, indiscriminate inclusions. Her notes have nevertheless remained an essential source {{for the study of}} Percy Shelley's work. As Bennett explains, [...] "biographers and critics agree that Mary Shelley's commitment to bring Shelley the notice she believed his works merited was the single, major force that established Shelley's reputation during a period when he <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> have faded from public view".|$|E

500|$|Cancellara was not {{considered}} to be a favorite for the Amstel Gold Race, though {{he was part of the}} strong squad that the Leopard Trek team brought to the race. Sporting director Kim Andersen stated the race was more of a goal for one of the Schleck brothers. Cancellara commented that he felt [...] "free as a bird" [...] in the Amstel, riding it for the first time since 2004, and that he was not under pressure to get a result. He identified Philippe Gilbert as the main favorite for the race, and promised not to ride against him as he felt his rivals had done to him in the cobbled classics. The race took place two days after Fränk Schleck's 30th birthday, further intensifying it as a goal for him. Cancellara and both Schleck brothers effectively stayed at the front of the race most of the day, but Cancellara and Fränk Schleck lost contact after crashing on the Gulperberg [...] from the finish. This left Andy Schleck alone to fend for victory, and his tactic was a solo attack launched from [...] out, on the Keutenberg. The tactic was nearly successful, as the younger Schleck brother occupied first position on the road with only [...] left to race, but a chase pack led by Gilbert overhauled him at that point. Visibly spent from his solo effort, Schleck had nothing left for the finale and finished 11th, 28 seconds down on race winner Gilbert. He stated after the race that he was satisfied with his effort, feeling that going for the win from so far out was his only play for victory without any teammates in the front group. He may have finished a few positions higher if he had stayed with the Gilbert group, but he <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> have had no chance for victory against the fast finisher Gilbert; thus, the solo attack was the correct move in his eyes, since his only ambition was victory. Danish rider Jakob Fuglsang, however, managed to snatch a result for the team, as he finished in 4th place, 5 seconds down on Gilbert.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of the 50 per cent embryo mortality to {{a study of the}} virus of Newcastle is described. It has been evaluated by a series of duplicate titrations of the same sample of virus. In seven such titrations the largest difference between the two was 10 – 0. 4.

This <b>would</b> mean that we can <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> detect a loss of 90 per cent of activity. Neither temperature of incubation nor route of inoculation in the test embryos had consistent effect on the measurement of virus activity. The effect of increasing age of the incubated embryo, from 10 days up to 16 days, is slight and inconsistent. The addition of chicken red blood cells to a dilution of virus may lower the titer of the preparation, but the change is not sufficient to be of importance in the routine handling of the virus...|$|R

The device <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> have caused suspicion when discovered in the shipment, which might explain why Basayev stopped to inspect it, at that point triggering the explosion.

50|$|One study {{concluded}} that women whose epidural infusions contained fentanyl {{were less likely to}} fully breastfeed their infant in the few days after birth and more likely to stop breastfeeding in the first 24 weeks. However, this study has been criticized for several reasons, one of which is that the original patient records were not examined in this study, and so many of the epidural infusions were assumed to contain fentanyl when <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> they <b>would</b> not have. In addition, all those who had received epidural infusions in this study had also received systemic pethidine, which would be {{much more likely to be}} the cause of any effect on breastfeeding due to the higher amounts of medication used via that route. If this were the case, then early epidural analgesia which avoided the need for pethidine would be expected to improve breastfeeding outcomes rather than worsen them. Traditional epidural for labor relieves pain reliably only during first stage of labor (uterine contractions until cervix is fully open). It does not relieve pain as reliably during the second stage of labor (passage of the fetus through the vagina).|$|R

There were the earls of Mercia, who bore no great love to the house of Godwin, and who resented the ascendency of the West Saxons. Lastly, there was Harold's brother Tostig, a fiery and turbulent noble, now Earl of Northumbria, who was jealous of Harold, ever ready to join in plots, and in close alliance with Norway already; he had several times withstood the royal authority, and would assuredly again become a fomenter of trouble should he see a favourable opportunity.

That case also concerned the alleged murder of one Aboriginal man by another, and the question of whether the court had jurisdiction, the court ultimately deciding that it did. Dowling [...] Chief Justice by the time of this case [...] criticised Judge Willis' decision, saying that R v Murrell was the authoritative case on the question, a view shared by Governor Gipps and the authorities in Britain. Bruce Kercher suggests that, if Bonjon had not ultimately been discharged, and instead tried and found guilty, the jurisdiction point would have been heard by a full court in Sydney, which <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> have overturned Judge Willis' position.

2500|$|Coaster brakes {{have the}} {{advantage}} of being protected from the elements and thus perform well in rain or snow. Though coaster brakes generally go years without needing maintenance, they are more complicated than rim brakes to repair if it becomes necessary, especially the more sophisticated type with expanding brake shoes. Coaster brakes also do not have sufficient heat dissipation for use on long descents, a characteristic made legendary through events such as the 'Repack Downhill' race, where riders <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> need to repack their coaster brakes after the grease melted or smoked due to the heat from lengthy downhill runs. A coaster brake can only be applied when the cranks are reasonably level, limiting how quickly it can be applied. As coaster brakes are only made for rear wheels, they have the disadvantage common to all rear brakes of skidding the wheel easily. This disadvantage may, however, be alleviated if the bicycle also has a hand-lever-operated front brake and the cyclist uses it. Another disadvantage is that the coaster brake is completely dependent on the chain being fully intact and engaged. If the chain breaks or disengages from the chainwheel and/or rear sprocket, the coaster brake provides no braking power whatsoever. [...] Like all hub brakes except disc brakes, a coaster brake requires a reaction arm to be connected to the frame. [...] This may require unbolting when the wheel is removed or moved in its fork ends to adjust chain tension.|$|E
