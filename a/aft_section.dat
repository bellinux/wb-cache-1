5|$|Of the ratings, 122 were Royal Marines. As an {{experiment}} during the ship's first commission, all of Warriors marines were from Royal Marine Artillery; subsequently some marine infantrymen were assigned {{as was the}} usual naval practice. The marines manned the <b>aft</b> <b>section</b> of guns and slung their hammocks between the crew's accommodation and the officers' cabins.|$|E
5|$|Before take-off, D'Mario placed three cloth-covered foam {{cushions}} {{on top of}} {{a heating}} vent under the instructor navigator's seat in the <b>aft</b> <b>section</b> of the lower deck. Shortly after take-off, another cushion was placed under the seat. The flight was uneventful until the scheduled mid-air refueling from a KC-135 Stratotanker, which had to be conducted manually because of an error with the B-52G's autopilot. About one hour after refueling, while the aircraft was circling above its designated area, Captain Haug directed co-pilot Svitenko to take his rest period. His seat was taken by the spare pilot, D'Mario. The crew was uncomfortable because of the cold, although the heater's rheostat was turned up, so D'Mario opened an engine bleed valve to draw additional hot air into the heater from the engine manifold. Because of a heater malfunction, the air barely cooled as it traveled from the engine manifold to the cabin's heating ducts. During the next half-hour, the cabin's temperature became uncomfortably hot, and the stowed cushions ignited. After one crew member reported smelling burning rubber, they looked for a fire. The navigator searched the lower compartment twice before discovering the fire behind a metal box. He attempted to fight it with two fire extinguishers, but could not put it out.|$|E
5|$|Larry Vaughn {{arrives at}} the Brody house before Brody returns home, and informs Ellen {{that he and his}} wife are leaving Amity. Before he leaves, he tells Ellen that he always thought they would have made a great couple. When Brody and Quint return to sea the {{following}} day, the shark starts ramming the boat, but Quint is able to harpoon it several times. The shark leaps out of the water and onto the stern of the Orca, ripping a huge hole in the <b>aft</b> <b>section</b> and causing the boat to begin to sink. Quint plunges another harpoon into the shark, but as it falls back into the water, his foot gets entangled in the rope, and he is dragged underwater to his death as he drowns. Brody, now floating on a seat cushion, spots the shark swimming towards him and prepares for his death. However, just as the shark gets within a few feet of him, it succumbs to its many wounds, rolls over in the water, and dies before it can kill Brody. The great fish sinks down out of sight, dragging Quint's still entangled body behind it. Brody manages to paddle back to shore on his makeshift float, the lone survivor of the ordeal.|$|E
50|$|In 1963, the ex-Chicopee was {{purchased}} by Sea-Land in 1963 for conversion to a container ship. The fore and <b>aft</b> <b>sections</b> were coupled with a new mid-body to create the 16,401-GRT 607 ft long SS San Francisco. In 1978, the extant portions of the hull of ex-Chicopee were scrapped, when the 1963 mid-body section was paired with new fore and <b>aft</b> <b>sections,</b> as the 17,618-GRT Sea-Land Adventurer. As of 2002, this ship is still operating as Maersk Koper.|$|R
5000|$|... was a [...] destroyer. Her bows {{were blown}} off in 1916, and her mid and <b>aft</b> <b>sections</b> were {{combined}} with the bows of the damaged destroyer , the resulting vessel being named [...] "".|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the Caterpillar engine led to a slight change in external appearance - previously the fore and <b>aft</b> <b>sections</b> had been practically identical in height, but to accommodate the Caterpillar engine the 'fore' (longer) section was raised slightly.|$|R
25|$|The J-20 has a {{long and}} wide fuselage, with the chiseled nose section and a {{frameless}} canopy resembling that of the F-22 Raptor. Immediately behind the cockpit are low observable intakes. All-moving canard surfaces with pronounced dihedral are placed behind the intakes, followed by leading edge extensions merging into delta wing with forward-swept trailing edges. The <b>aft</b> <b>section</b> features twin, outward canted all-moving fins, short but deep ventral strakes, and conventional round engine exhausts.|$|E
25|$|Located a {{few hundred}} metres from the shore from Valletta, HMS Maori is now a popular dive site. The bow section lies in white sand {{at a depth of}} , the <b>aft</b> <b>section</b> of the ship having been {{abandoned}} in deep water during the tow from Grand Harbour to Marsamxett Harbour. Much of the forward superstructure is extant, including the two front gun bases. Much marine life {{can be found on the}} wreck.|$|E
25|$|A {{supercritical}} airfoil is an airfoil designed, primarily, {{to delay the}} onset of wave drag on aircraft in the transonic speed range. Supercritical airfoils are characterized by their flattened upper surface, highly cambered <b>aft</b> <b>section,</b> and greater leading edge radius as compared to traditional airfoil shapes. The {{supercritical airfoil}} was invented and designed by NASA aeronautical engineer Richard Whitcomb in the 1960s. Testing successfully commenced on a United States Navy Vought F-8U fighter through wind tunnel results in 1971.|$|E
50|$|In 1959-1960, she was {{salvaged}} by Fujita Salvage Company, {{with the}} fore and <b>aft</b> <b>sections</b> {{of the hull}} welded together while the engine room was left, as it was too heavy to refloat. The welded fore and aft was towed back to Japan and broken up.|$|R
50|$|MV Target was {{converted}} at the COSCO shipyard in Nantong, China. A new midsection was fitted to {{the bow and}} <b>aft</b> <b>sections</b> of the single-hull tanker. She has a carrying capacity in excess of 35,000 tons and an unobstructed deck area measuring 44.5 m x 130 m.|$|R
50|$|Later, the hulk was towed to the Lago Dry Dock on Aruba {{where she}} was cut into three sections. The fore and <b>aft</b> <b>sections</b> were joined {{together}} and the ship made way under her own power to Baltimore, Maryland, where she had a new midsection installed, and continued her career.|$|R
25|$|USS O'Bannon {{suppressed}} enemy batteries on May 29 {{after the}} North Koreans {{opened fire on}} friendly islands. The USS Ozbourn, , and USS Heron also engaged on May 29 and May 30. Ozbourn received six rounds of 155-millimeter fire and, the Radford, ten rounds of estimated 75-millimeter gunfire with the nearest one landing fifty yards from the ship. The Heron was hit by machine gun fire that hit <b>aft</b> <b>section</b> of the vessel. There were no friendly casualties {{in any of the}} actions and in all cases the ships returned fire with naval guns.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} hit {{the water}} with the tail first. The impact caused the fuselage to break into three main parts. The largest was the 26-meter (85ft) forward section of the aircraft, from the nose to {{the trailing edge of}} the wings. It remained afloat after the accident for about twenty hours. The midsection was 13meters (42ft) long, from the trailing edge of the wing to the rear pressure bulkhead. The <b>aft</b> <b>section</b> consisted of the tail cone, including all of the horizontal stabilizers and the vertical stabilizers. The engines and landing gear separated from the aircraft at the time of impact.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} found in June 1926 and the Ministry of Defence {{immediately}} began planning a salvage operation. S2 was lying upside down {{at a depth of}} only 15 meters (50 feet) and it was believed that the lifting operation would not be too difficult. The salvagers first tried to lift the ship by pumping air into the hull. This lifted the fore section to the surface, but the <b>aft</b> <b>section</b> was securely stuck in the bottom mud. They tried to loosen it by aiming high-pressure streams of water against the mud, but to no avail.|$|E
50|$|The {{damaged ship}} was cut into three sections. The fore and <b>aft</b> <b>sections</b> were joined {{together}} and the ship {{made her way to}} Baltimore, Maryland, to be rebuilt. The middle section was left in Aruba and, after being used {{for a number of years}} as a target by Dutch gunners after the war, has become a scuba diving site.|$|R
25|$|The crew enjoyed, for {{the first}} time in a bomber, full-pressurization comfort. This first-ever cabin {{pressure}} system for an Allied production bomber was developed for the B-29 by Garrett AiResearch. The nose and the cockpit were pressurized, but the designers were faced with deciding whether to have bomb bays that were not pressurized, between fore and <b>aft</b> pressurized <b>sections,</b> or a fully pressurized fuselage with the need to de-pressurize to drop their loads. The solution was a long tunnel over the two bomb bays so as not to interrupt pressurization during bombing. Crews could crawl back and forth between the fore and <b>aft</b> <b>sections,</b> with both areas and the tunnel pressurized. The bomb bays were not pressurized.|$|R
40|$|A direct {{comparison}} {{is made of}} the thermal field properties for a low-disturbance and a high-disturbance level condition affecting the low-temperature air jets introduced into gas turbine combustor <b>aft</b> <b>sections</b> in order both to cool the high-temperature gases and quench the combustion reactions. Sixty-four fast-response thermocouples were simultaneously sampled and corrected for their time constant effect at a downstream plane close to the jet exit. Histograms formed from independent samples were sufficiently smooth to approximate a pdf...|$|R
25|$|Cassiopea {{launched}} a torpedo at Paladin while attacking Pakenham with gunfire. Paladin successfully evaded the torpedo, but Pakenhams port side took six hits. The destroyer's engine room was seriously damaged and flooded, its pom-pom and searchlight {{put out of}} action, and a fire started in the <b>aft</b> <b>section.</b> Several of her crew were scalded by the explosion of a boiler. Nine men were killed, another died of his wounds two days later. Paladin was also damaged by shell splinters. Cassiopea, almost disabled by return fire and in flames, was assisted by her sister ship Climene, which towed her back to Trapani and later to Taranto for repairs.|$|E
25|$|The {{layout of}} the DH.100 used a single jet engine {{installed}} in an egg-shaped fuselage which was primarily composed of plywood for the forward section and aluminium throughout the <b>aft</b> <b>section.</b> It was furnished with conventional mid-mounted straight wings; air brakes were installed on the wings to slow the aircraft, better enabling it to manoeuvre into a firing position behind slower aircraft - a feature that had also been incorporated in the Meteor. Armament comprised four 20mm Hispano Mk V cannon located underneath the nose; from {{the onset of the}} design phase, even when the aircraft was officially intended to serve only as an experimental aircraft, the provision for the cannon armament had been included.|$|E
25|$|The Sports deck (topmost) {{was mostly}} an outside {{recreation}} area. Two walkways in the <b>aft</b> <b>section</b> abutted the swimming pools {{on the deck}} below. The section closest to the bow lay atop the ship's bridge. Most of the sports deck was a spacious rooftop space. Lido deck constituted the pool area {{of the ship and}} also housed the bridge closer to the bow. There were two nearly oval-shaped swimming pools surrounded by a spacious lido area. Ahead of the lido section and behind the officers' quarters aft of the wheelhouse was a small buffet. The interior portion of the deck continued around the lido area via glass-enclosed walkways. These walkways were just inboard of the ship's lifeboats. Boat deck contained most of the first class cabins and there were 34 that were especially luxurious. The Card Room and Reading Room were aft of the passenger accommodations. A teak promenade encircled the entirety of Boat Deck, designed to slope towards its amidships section as a way to compensate for the swaying of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|The new {{fuselage}} section is constructed {{as a single}} large component, including the vertical stabilizer. When attached to the existing nose section, the fuselage is 55 feet (16.8 m) long and 9 feet (2.74 m) diameter. The fuselage has upper and lower halves, each with a roughly-oval shape similar to a canoe. The halves are bonded to circular frames. The {{fuselage section}} ahead of the entrance door consists of the existing (metal) 328J component, with fasteners used to bring the forward and new <b>aft</b> <b>sections</b> together.|$|R
2500|$|Jimmy Carter {{is roughly}} 100 feet (30 m) {{longer than the}} other two ships of her class, [...] and USS Connecticut. This is due to the {{insertion}} of a plug (additional section) known as the Multi-Mission Platform (MMP), which allows launch and recovery of ROVs and Navy SEAL forces. The plug features a fairing over a wasp-waist shaped passageway allowing crew to pass between the fore and <b>aft</b> <b>sections</b> of the hull while providing a space to store ROVs and special equipment that may need to launch and recover from the submarine.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{powered by}} a Wright Whirlwind J-5 of [...] {{take-off}} power and [...] nominal power, produced in the Polish Skoda Works as the Skoda-Wright J-5. This drove a two-blade metal propeller and was fitted with a Townend ring cowling. The PWS-54 had a conventional fixed undercarriage with a rear wheel. Each mainwheel was mounted on a V-form, steel tube strut hinged to the lower fuselage, with long, vertical shock absorber legs to the wings. The wheels were enclosed with spats that split into fore and <b>aft</b> <b>sections</b> for servicing.|$|R
25|$|On the bridge, Captain Bartlett {{was already}} {{considering}} efforts {{to save the}} ship, despite its increasingly dire condition. Only two minutes after the blast, boiler rooms five and six had to be evacuated. In about ten minutes, Britannic was roughly in the same condition Titanic had been in one hour after the collision with the iceberg. Fifteen minutes after the ship was struck, the open portholes on E Deck were underwater. With water also entering the ship's <b>aft</b> <b>section</b> from the bulkhead between boiler rooms four and five, Britannic quickly developed a serious list to starboard due to {{the weight of the}} water flooding into the starboard side. With the shores of the Greek island Kea to the right, Bartlett gave the order to navigate the ship towards the island in attempt to beach the vessel. The effect of the ship's starboard list and the weight of the rudder made attempts to navigate the ship under its own power difficult, and the steering gear was knocked out by the explosion, which eliminated steering by the rudder. However, the captain ordered the port shaft driven at a higher speed than the starboard side, which helped the ship move towards the island.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 18 November, U-43 fired four torpedoes at Convoy SC-109 and hit the 9,131 ton American tanker Brilliant, loaded with [...] of fuel oil. A [...] {{diameter}} hole was made in her side, and the cargo caught fire. While some of the crew abandoned ship, those remaining aboard managed to put the fires out; making only three knots, the ship limped the [...] to Bonavista Bay, Newfoundland, arriving on 24 November. Brilliant eventually left Newfoundland on 18 January 1943 under tow, but after two days the ship broke in half. The fore section sank immediately, while the <b>aft</b> <b>section</b> drifted for some days before it was found and the 44 crew rescued. The <b>aft</b> <b>section</b> was taken in tow, but sank the next day. U-43 arrived back at Lorient on 9 December after a patrol of 78 days.|$|E
500|$|The forward conning tower had {{a forward}} face of [...] that thinned down to 225mm on the <b>aft</b> <b>section</b> with a [...] roof. Its {{controls}} and cable runs were {{protected by a}} 100mm tube and {{the lower part of}} the conning tower's supporting structure was protected with 20mm plates. Aft there was a lightly protected auxiliary control station with 50mm sides. Between the middle and lower decks the funnel uptakes were protected by 100mm of armor and [...] between the upper and middle decks. A 125mm upper and [...] lower grating protected the boilers from shells and fragments entering through the uptake openings.|$|E

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} involved was Boeing 737-3H4, {{registration number}} N632SW, manufacturer's serial number 27707, [...] line number 2799. Manufacturing of the airframe was completed on May 22, 1996, and the aircraft {{was delivered to}} Southwest on June 13 of that year. The aircraft fuselage was manufactured at Boeing's Wichita, Kansas facility, and was shipped in two pieces (forward and <b>aft</b> <b>sections)</b> by rail on April 1, 1996, from Wichita to Boeing's Renton, Washington facility for final assembly. The Renton facility then joined the forward and <b>aft</b> fuselage <b>sections,</b> completing a drilling and riveting process that had been intentionally left unfinished at the Wichita facility, for ease of production in Renton. The area of fuselage crown skin that would fail in this incident was {{at the site of}} the split manufacturing process, where work was partially performed in Wichita and finished in Renton. At the time of the incident, the aircraft had completed 48,748 hours and 39,786 cycles.|$|R
5|$|During {{the night}} of 29 March 1945, Kommandøren was docked at the remains of Søndre Nykirkekai in Bergen. At around 01:00 the ship was struck by one of two torpedoes accidentally fired by a German torpedo boat {{anchored}} {{on the opposite side}} of Vågen bay. The torpedo explosion threw debris from Kommandøren over a wide area, and left the ship lying on the harbour bed. Only the mast and a section of the bow remained above water. The midship and <b>aft</b> <b>sections</b> of the ship were completely destroyed by the torpedo. The only crew member on board at the time, Able Seaman Alf Larsen, was killed in the incident.|$|R
500|$|Melbourne struck Voyager just aft of the {{destroyer}}'s bridge, {{rolling the}} destroyer to starboard before cutting her in half. Voyagers forward boiler exploded, briefly {{setting fire to}} {{the bow of the}} carrier before it was extinguished by seawater. The destroyer's forward section sank quickly, {{under the weight of the}} two [...] gun turrets. The <b>aft</b> <b>section</b> did not begin sinking until half an hour after the collision, completely submerging just after midnight. Messages were immediately sent to the Fleet Headquarters in Sydney, although staff in Sydney initially underestimated the extent of the damage to Voyager. Melbourne launched her boats to recover survivors, and the carrier's wardroom and C Hangar were prepared for casualties. At 9:58pm, Melbourne was informed that search-and-rescue boats from , helicopters from , and five Ton-class minesweepers had been despatched to assist in the search.|$|E
500|$|A {{portion of}} the {{surviving}} crew revisited the site on 14 December 1984, but the shipwreck was not located until 15 years later. In 1999, Italian wreck divers located a [...] long bow section [...] off Škrda. It lies on the port side, {{at a depth of}} , but it is normally obscured by silt stirred up by trawling further north in the Kvarner Gulf. The <b>aft</b> <b>section</b> of the ship was discovered in 2000 through testimony of a fisherman from Pag. It was found closer to Škrda, approximately [...] away from the bow section. Aldenhams [...] boilers and propellers were still operating as the ship sank, and the section struck the silty seafloor at a depth of , with her keel on top.

2500|$|The {{most visible}} {{difference}} between the Jupiter-C first stage and the Mercury-Redstone was in the section just below the Mercury capsule and above the propellant tanks. [...] This section {{was known as the}} <b>aft</b> <b>section,</b> a term which was inherited from the military Redstone. [...] (The actual rear end of the rocket was called the tail section.) [...] The <b>aft</b> <b>section</b> held most of the Mercury-Redstone's electronics and instrumentation, including the guidance system, as well as the adapter for the Mercury capsule. [...] In the military Redstone and the Jupiter-C first stage, when the rocket had burned out, its lower portion, containing the rocket engine and propellant tanks, would separate from the <b>aft</b> <b>section</b> and be discarded, and the <b>aft</b> <b>section,</b> with its guidance system, would direct {{the top half of the}} rocket during its unpowered ballistic flight. [...] However, in the Mercury-Redstone, the <b>aft</b> <b>section</b> was permanently attached to the lower portion of the rocket. [...] When the rocket had shut down, the Mercury capsule would separate from the <b>aft</b> <b>section</b> and would rely on its own guidance.|$|E

5|$|Development {{work on the}} CFM56 began before CFMI was {{formally}} created. While work proceeded smoothly, the international arrangement led to unique working conditions. For example, both companies had assembly lines, some engines were assembled and tested in the U.S. and others in France. Engines assembled in France were subject to the initially strict export agreement, which meant that GE's core {{was built in the}} U.S., then shipped to the SNECMA plant in France where it was placed in a locked room into which even the President of SNECMA was not allowed. The SNECMA components (the fore and <b>aft</b> <b>sections</b> of the engine) were brought into the room, GE employees mounted them to the core, and then the assembled engine was taken out to be finished.|$|R
50|$|From {{this period}} {{increased}} {{knowledge and understanding}} of hydrodynamics and aerodynamics, coupled to the availability of plywood and reliable waterproof glues saw dramatic changes. Clinker and carvel construction was dropped and glued up hollow pear shaped masts became standard. By the late 1960s a greater understanding of the science behind planning saw hulls made with increasingly less rocker, very fine forward with very flat <b>aft</b> <b>sections.</b> Once trapezes were introduced the number of crew dropped to 4 by the early 70s and then to 3. Designs became wider, especially aft. As speeds increased so did capsizes, so an effort was made to install built in buoyancy and some self draining capabilities with transom flaps, venturi floor drains built in tanks, especially forward and false floors.|$|R
