5|$|Thomas Aquinas, while proposing five proofs of God's {{existence}} in his Summa Theologica, objected to Anselm's <b>argument.</b> He suggested that people cannot know {{the nature of}} God and, therefore, cannot conceive of God in the way Anselm proposed. The ontological <b>argument</b> would be meaningful only to someone who understands the essence of God completely. Aquinas reasoned that, as only God can completely know His essence, only He could use the <b>argument.</b> His rejection of the ontological <b>argument</b> caused other Catholic theologians to also reject the <b>argument.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{the ontological}} <b>argument</b> {{may have been}} {{implicit}} {{in the works of}} Greek philosophers such as Plato and the Neoplatonists, the mainstream view is that the ontological <b>argument</b> was first clearly stated and developed by Anselm of Canterbury. Some scholars argued that the Islamic philosopher Avicenna (Ibn Sina) developed a special kind of ontological <b>argument</b> before Anselm, but other scholars have doubted this position. Daniel Dombrowski marked three major stages {{in the development of the}} argument: Anselm's initial explicit formulation; the eighteenth century criticisms of Kant and Hume; and the identification of a second ontological <b>argument</b> in Anselm's Proslogion by twentieth century philosophers.|$|E

500|$|Oppy subclassified ontological <b>arguments</b> into definitional, {{conceptual}} (or hyperintensional), modal, Meinongian, experiential, mereological, higher-order, or Hegelian categories, {{based on}} the qualities of their premises. He defined these qualities as follows: definitional <b>arguments</b> invoke definitions; conceptual <b>arguments</b> invoke [...] "the possession of certain kinds of ideas or concepts"; modal <b>arguments</b> consider possibilities; Meinongian <b>arguments</b> assert [...] "a distinction between different categories of existence"; experiential <b>arguments</b> employ the idea that God exists solely {{to those who have}} had experience of him; and Hegelian <b>arguments</b> are from Hegel. He later categorised mereological as <b>arguments</b> that [...] "draw on… the theory of the whole-part relation".|$|R

5|$|Plantinga's {{free will}} defense begins by asserting that Mackie's <b>argument</b> failed to {{establish}} an explicit logical contradiction between God {{and the existence of}} evil. In other words Plantinga shows that (1-4) are not on their own contradictory, and that any contradiction must originate from an atheologian's implicit unstated assumptions, assumptions representing premises not stated in the <b>argument</b> itself. With an explicit contradiction ruled out, an atheologian must add premises to the <b>argument</b> for it to succeed. Nonetheless, if Plantinga had offered no further <b>argument</b> then an atheologian's intuitive impressions that a contradiction must exist would have remain unanswered. Plantinga sought to resolve this by offering two further points.|$|E

5|$|The <b>argument</b> from {{morality}} is an <b>argument</b> {{for the existence}} of God. Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. The <b>argument</b> from {{morality is}} noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the <b>argument</b> without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E

It is rare to find a philosopher, particularly in the Western philosophical tradition, who lacks many <b>arguments.</b> Philosophers are, or at least are expected to be, very good at giving <b>arguments.</b> They constantly demand and offer <b>arguments</b> for different claims they make.

40|$|Although many authors {{claim that}} argumentation is a process, in most models the {{procedural}} side of argumentation {{is restricted to}} the definition of a procedural framework that is able to compare <b>arguments.</b> This paper elaborates on the procedural side of argumentation. A distinction is made between structural and procedural <b>arguments.</b> Structural <b>arguments</b> are characterized by their specific structure. The elements recognized in the analysis of structural <b>arguments</b> are used to illustrate the attack, justification and construction of structural <b>arguments</b> in a procedural model. Subsequently the question is addressed whether structural <b>arguments</b> necessarily have underlying rules. Procedural <b>arguments</b> are characterized by the procedure in which they are adduced. It is argued that there is more to argumentation than structure. Therefore the notion procedural <b>arguments</b> is introduced and elaborated. Especially in legal practice, e. g. court decisions, non-structural, procedural <b>arguments</b> play an important role. It is argued that procedural models of legal reasoning should take procedural <b>arguments</b> into account. 1...|$|R

5|$|The twentieth-century philosopher Reinhold Niebuhr {{attempted}} to reinterpret the Augustinian theodicy {{in the light}} of evolutionary science by presenting its underlying <b>argument</b> without mythology. Niebuhr proposed that Augustine rejected the Manichean view that grants evil ontological existence and ties humans' sin to their created state. Augustine's <b>argument</b> continued, according to Niebuhr, by proposing that humans have a tendency to sin because of a biologically inherited nature and rejected the Pelagian view that human will could overcome sin on its own. Niebuhr believed Augustine's <b>argument</b> placed sin in the human will, which was corrupted by Adam's original sin. He argued that the logic behind Augustine's theodicy described sin as inevitable but unnecessary, which he believed captured the <b>argument</b> without relying on a literal interpretation of the fall, thus avoiding critique from scientific positions.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the vast}} {{literature}} on Rawls's work, few have discussed his <b>arguments</b> {{for the value}} of democracy. When his <b>arguments</b> have been discussed, they have received staunch criticism. Some critics have charged that Rawls's <b>arguments</b> are not deeply democratic. Others have gone further, claiming that Rawls's <b>arguments</b> denigrate democracy. These criticisms are unsurprising, since Rawls's <b>arguments,</b> as <b>arguments</b> that the principle of equal basic liberty needs to include democratic liberties, are incomplete. In contrast to his trenchant remarks about core civil liberties, Rawls does not say much about the inclusion of political liberties of a democratic sort – such as the right to vote – among the basic liberties. -/- In this paper, I complete some of Rawls's <b>arguments</b> and show that he has grounds for including political liberties, particularly those of a democratic nature, in the principle of equal basic liberty. In doing so, I make some beginning steps toward illustrating the genuinely democratic nature of Rawls's <b>arguments.</b> Rawls believes that a few different <b>arguments</b> can be given for democratic institutions and that these <b>arguments</b> work together to support the value of democracy.

Plantinga's <b>argument</b> is a defense against the logical problem of evil as formulated by philosopher J. L. Mackie beginning in 1955.
