60|$|In Utopia, a great {{multitude}} of selected men, chosen volunteers, will be collaborating upon this new step in man's {{struggle with the}} elements. Bacon's visionary House of Saloman [Footnote: In The New Atlantis.] will be a thing realised, {{and it will be}} humming with this business. Every university in the world will be urgently working for priority in this aspect of the problem or that. Reports of experiments, as full and as prompt as the telegraphic reports of cricket in our more sportive atmosphere, will go about the world. All this will be passing, as it were, behind the <b>act</b> <b>drop</b> of our first experience, behind this first picture of the urbanised Urseren valley. The literature of the subject will be growing and developing with the easy swiftness of an eagle's swoop as we come down the hillside; unseen in that twilight, unthought of by us until this moment, a thousand men at a thousand glowing desks, a busy specialist press, will be perpetually sifting, criticising, condensing, and clearing the ground for further speculation. Those who are concerned with the problems of public locomotion will be following these aeronautic investigations with a keen and enterprising interest, and so will the physiologist and the sociologist. That Utopian research will, I say, go like an eagle's swoop in comparison with the blind-man's fumbling of our terrestrial way. Even before our own brief Utopian journey is out, we may get a glimpse of the swift ripening of all this activity that will be in progress at our coming. To-morrow, perhaps, or in a day or so, some silent, distant thing will come gliding into view over the mountains, will turn and soar and pass again beyond our astonished sight....|$|E

50|$|The stage {{represents}} {{perhaps the}} most complete working example of the English wood stage - possessing four bridges, eight cuts, one carpet cut, two corner traps, two staircase traps, three object traps and one grave trap. Overhead there {{is a series of}} drum and shaft mechanisms to operate synchronised scene-changes, and a hemp fly floor stage left with drum and shaft for the <b>act</b> <b>drop.</b>|$|E

50|$|Because Carpezat worked {{mainly on}} an independent, {{commercial}} basis, relatively {{few of his}} original set designs and scale-models have come down to us. For instance, all maquettes by Carpezat for the Académie Royale de Musique are preserved at the Bibliothèque-Musée de l'Opéra; by contrast, virtually no materials testify to Carpezat's rich activity at other venues in and outside France. Still, numerous photographs of Carpezat's works are available in illustrated periodicals such as Le théâtre, L'Art du théâtre, and Comœdia illustré, while a large-scale artifact of Carpezat's oeuvre survives {{in the guise of}} a painted <b>act</b> <b>drop</b> at the Theatro da Paz in Belém.|$|E
5000|$|In 1976 the {{restoration}} began {{under the direction}} of architect and theatre expert, Victor Glasstone.The theatre underwent further restoration from the 1990s to replicate its 1900 opening condition in time for the centenary celebration in 2000. Exactly 100 years after opening, on 16 July 2000, the centenary was celebrated with a performance of [...] "The Telephone Girl" [...] which opened the Gaiety in 1900 and following which was a performance of [...] "The Corsican Brothers," [...] a popular play which in Victorian times and a special 'Corsican Trap' was constructed for the performance. It {{is believed to be the}} only working Corsican Trap in the World. Another unique feature of the theatre is the working <b>Act</b> <b>Drop</b> depicting a dancing lady.|$|E

50|$|New Romanticism {{emerged in}} London nightclubs {{including}} Billy's and The Blitz Club {{towards the end}} of the 1970s. Influenced by David Bowie and Roxy Music, it developed glam rock fashions, gaining its name from the frilly fop shirts of early Romanticism. New Romantic music often made extensive use of synthesisers. Pioneers included Visage and Ultravox and among the commercially most successful acts associated with the movement were Adam and the Ants, Culture Club, Spandau Ballet and Duran Duran. By about 1983 the original movement had dissolved, with surviving <b>acts</b> <b>dropping</b> most of the fashion elements to pursue mainstream careers.|$|R
5|$|White supremacists, {{such as the}} Ku Klux Klan (KKK), used {{paramilitary}} {{violence to}} prevent blacks from voting. A number of blacks were killed at the Colfax massacre of 1873 while attempting to defend their right to vote. The Enforcement Acts were passed by Congress in 1870–1871 to authorize federal prosecution of the KKK and others who violated the amendment. However, as Reconstruction neared its end and federal troops withdrew, prosecutions under the Enforcement <b>Acts</b> <b>dropped</b> significantly. In United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the Supreme Court ruled {{that the federal government}} did not have the authority to prosecute the perpetrators of the Colfax massacre because they were not state actors.|$|R

5|$|Farrell was {{inspired}} to try acting when Henry Thomas' performance in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial moved him to tears. With his brother's encouragement, he attended the Gaiety School of <b>Acting,</b> <b>dropping</b> out when he was cast as Danny Byrne on Ballykissangel, a BBC drama about a young English priest who becomes part of an Irish rural community. As an 18-year-old travelling in Sydney, he was at one time suspected for attempted murder. The police sketch looked remarkably like him and he had even described blacking out during the night in question. His only alibi was apparently a journal kept by his friend that explained the two had been across town that night, taking MDMA.|$|R
50|$|Guido meets Moranzone {{on the way}} to the Duke - he {{explains}} that he has decided not to kill the Duke. Instead he intends to leave the dagger with a letter, so the Duke will know Guido had him in his power and chose to spare him. Moranzone calls him a coward and bad son, and blames his contact with the Duchess for his change of heart. While Guido prays alone that he has done the right thing, the Duchess enters, and tells him there is nothing separating them any more - because she has killed the Duke. Guido rejects her in horror, and they argue. He repents of his reaction as she leaves, and the <b>act</b> <b>drops</b> on her leading the guard to arrest Guido.|$|R

2500|$|Although the Government of Canada, {{through the}} Department of Indian Affairs (now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada), persecuted sun dance {{practitioners}} {{and attempted to}} suppress the dance, the ceremony itself was never officially prohibited. But Indian agents, based on directives from their superiors, did routinely interfere with, discourage, and disallow sun dances on many Canadian plains reserves from 1882 until the 1940s. Despite this, sun dance practitioners, such as the Plains Cree, Saulteaux, and Blackfoot, continued to hold sun dances throughout the persecution period. [...] Some practiced the dance in secret, others with permissions from their agents, and others without the body piercing. The Cree and Saulteaux have conducted at least one Rain Dance (with similar elements) each year since 1880 somewhere on the Canadian Plains. In 1951, government officials revamped the Indian <b>Act,</b> <b>dropping</b> the prohibition against practices of flesh-sacrificing and gift-giving.|$|R

50|$|On August 9, on {{what would}} have been Drew's first game in Philadelphia, he sat out, citing a bruised right hand. In an attempt to confuse the Philadelphia fans, he did not wear his own jersey that night, which instead was worn by bullpen catcher, Jeff Murphy. The attempt failed, however, and he was booed and heckled {{throughout}} batting practice. The only time he received cheers was when he booted three consecutive grounders in the outfield while his teammates were taking batting practice. On August 10, , in Drew's first game at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, he was booed loudly, and even had batteries thrown at him by two fans. The Phillie Phanatic got into the <b>act,</b> <b>dropping</b> two large trash bags marked with dollar signs in the outfield between innings. Drew struggled to stay healthy, landing on the disabled list every season he played in St. Louis.|$|R
