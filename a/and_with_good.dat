5|$|After {{the recent}} events, Queen Margaret still {{considered}} Warwick {{a threat to}} the throne, and cut off his supplies. In August 1457, however, a French attack on the English seaport of Sandwich set off fears of a full-scale French invasion. Warwick was again funded to protect the garrison and patrol the English coast. In disregard of royal authority, he then conducted highly successful acts of piracy, against the Castilian fleet in May 1458, and against the Hanseatic fleet a few weeks later. He also used his time on the Continent to establish relations with Charles VII of France and Philip the Good of Burgundy. Developing a solid military reputation <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>good</b> international connections, he then brought a part of his garrison to England, where he met up with his father and York in the summer of 1459.|$|E
5|$|Round Hill (sometimes spelt Roundhill) is {{an inner}} {{suburban}} area of Brighton, {{part of the}} coastal city of Brighton and Hove in England. The area contains a mix of privately owned and privately rented terraced housing, much {{of which has been}} converted for multiple occupancy, and small-scale commercial development. It was developed mostly in the late 19th century on an area of high land overlooking central Brighton, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>good</b> views in all directions, the area became a desirable middle-class suburb—particularly the large terraced houses of Roundhill Crescent and Richmond Road, and the exclusive Park Crescent—and within a few decades the whole of the hill had been built up with smaller terraces and some large villas.|$|E
5|$|Upon first forming, {{the system}} contended with the {{entrainment}} of dry {{air to the}} northwest of the storm, which was expected to limit intensification. The storm steadily intensified, and early on June 2 the IMD upgraded it to deep depression status. Later in the day the IMD classified the system as Cyclonic Storm Gonu about 760km (470mi) southwest of Mumbai, India. As a mid-latitude trough developed over Pakistan, Gonu turned {{to the north and}} northeast, though it resumed a westward track after ridging built {{to the north of the}} storm. With a solid area of intense convection, it rapidly intensified to attain severe cyclonic status early on June 3, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>good</b> outflow the JTWC upgraded it to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane. The dry air ultimately had a smaller impact on the intensification than previously estimated. A well-defined eye developed in the center of convection, and after moving over a local increase in ocean heat content, Gonu rapidly deepened.|$|E

25|$|Slavery is {{more common}} when the labour done is {{relatively}} simple and thus easy to supervise, such as large-scale growing of a single crop. It {{is much more difficult}} and costly to check that slaves are doing their best <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>good</b> quality when they are doing complex tasks. Therefore, slavery was seen as the most efficient method of production for large-scale crops like sugar and cotton, whose output was based on economies of scale. This enabled a gang system of labour to be prominent on large plantations where field hands were monitored and worked with factory-like precision. Each work gang was based on an internal division of labour that not only assigned every member of the gang to a precise task but simultaneously made their own performance dependent on the actions of the others. The hoe hands chopped out the weeds that surrounded the cotton plants as well as excessive sprouts. The plow gangs followed behind, stirring the soil near the rows of cotton plants and tossing it back around the plants. Thus, the gang system worked like an early version of the assembly line later to be found in factories.|$|E
25|$|England started {{cautiously}} in {{the only}} Twenty20 International against Australia at the Rose Bowl, only hitting six runs off the first two overs as they saw off the bowlers, but Geraint Jones then decided {{to have fun with}} Brett Lee. Hitting two boundaries off the next over, Lee was hit for 14, and England moved rapidly to 28 for no loss before Jones cut McGrath to deep third man, where Kasprowicz took a catch on the boundary – out for 19 with four fours. Marcus Trescothick hit a single to end the over, but England were happy enough with 29 for 1 after four overs. Lee's next over was, again, hit for 14, as Lee served up one wide and a no-ball to end with three overs for 31 as singles were taken off every ball. That prompted a bowling change, with Michael Kasprowicz coming on for Australia, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>good</b> reward, as the penultimate ball of his over was caught by Symonds at midwicket – Andrew Flintoff out for 6. Kevin Pietersen managed to scamper a single, and after six overs, England were 50 for 2.|$|E

25|$|The {{left wing}} depicts the {{beheading}} of St John the Baptist. His headless body {{lies in the}} left foreground and seems to reach out of the picture, as blood spurts from his severed neck, spraying his hands and the nearby plants. The foreground in the flora are reduced {{to the extent that}} they could not have been painted without a magnifying glass. The executioner stands with his back to the viewer, placing the freshly severed head on Salome's platter. The executioner, Salome, and three gesticulating bystanders form a circle around John's headless and lifeless body. According to Ridderbos, the five figures mirror and create a sense of unity with the five holy figures in the central panel. The scene is set in a courtyard in front of Herod's palace; the banquet that preceded the Baptist's decapitation can be seen in the left-midground of the palace, where minstrels play for Salome's dance. The banquet is well-lit <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>good</b> architectural perspective. Albert Michiels described Salome as ravishing but emotionless; she receives the head, with her eyes held aloof. Other versions of St John's beheading (decollation) more typically showed Salome holding an empty plate for the executioner; with an early version typified in a miniature in the Petites Heures of Jean de France, Duc de Berry.|$|E
25|$|England {{obviously}} {{needed to}} do something to maintain their hold on the Ashes and three changes were made to the team. The first was forced as Godfrey Evans had broken his middle finger and the reserve wicket-keeper Roy Swetman made his Test debut. This was not so much of a loss as first thought, Evans had not batted well for some years and Swetman had impressed behind the stumps throughout the tour and his batting had improved beyond all hopes. Peter Richardson had failed repeatedly as an opening batsman in the Tests and was replaced by his old opening partner Arthur Milton, even though he had broken his finger at Christmas. Willie Watson was dropped in favour of the newly arrived Cambridge and Sussex batsman Ted Dexter, who was also a more than useful swing bowler. May also had his final trump card, the fast bowler Fred Trueman, who had been ill at Brisbane and left out at Melbourne. He is widely considered to be England's greatest fast bowler <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>good</b> reason; he was the first man to take 300 wickets in Tests—307 at (21.57)—had tremendous stamina and bowled with a near perfect side on action that produced late swing at high pace. He was full of confidence and believed that he could get any batsman out on any wicket. Australia made changes as well, dropping Lindsay Kline who had taken 0/77 in two Tests and Bobby Simpson who had made a duck but was retained as twelfth man for his fielding. Instead they brought in the dual purpose fast-medium seamer and off-spinner Keith Slater, who had been twelfth man in the Second Test, but who had been accused of throwing by the MCC and Keith Miller. Mel McInnes kept his place as umpire even though Peter May and Freddie Brown had pointedly asked if it was necessary for him to officiate in all the Tests.|$|E

500|$|Magna Carta carries little legal {{weight in}} modern Britain, {{as most of}} its clauses have been {{repealed}} and relevant rights ensured by other statutes, but the historian James Holt remarks that {{the survival of the}} 1215 charter in national life is a [...] "reflexion of the continuous development of English law and administration" [...] and symbolic of the many struggles between authority and the law over the centuries. The historian W. L. Warren has observed that [...] "many who knew little and cared less about the content of the Charter have, in nearly all ages, invoked its name, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>good</b> cause, for it meant more than it said".|$|E

Not all electric toothbrushes are equally effective and even a good design needs to be used properly for best effect, but: [...] "Electric toothbrushes tend {{to help people who}} are not as good at cleaning teeth and as a result have had oral hygiene problems." [...] The most important advantage of electric toothbrushes is their ability to aid people with dexterity difficulties, such as those associated with rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
500|$|While chairman, Biden {{presided over}} the two most {{contentious}} U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings in history, those for Robert Bork in 1987 and Clarence Thomas in 1991. In the Bork hearings, he stated his opposition to Bork soon after the nomination, reversing an approval in an interview of a hypothetical Bork nomination {{he had made the}} previous year and angering conservatives who thought he could not conduct the hearings dispassionately. At the close, he won praise for conducting the proceedings fairly <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>good</b> humor and courage, as his 1988 presidential campaign collapsed {{in the middle of the}} hearings. [...] Rejecting some of the less intellectually honest arguments that other Bork opponents were making, Biden framed his discussion around the belief that the U.S. Constitution provides rights to liberty and privacy that extend beyond those explicitly enumerated in the text, and that Bork's strong originalism was ideologically incompatible with that view. Bork's nomination was rejected in the committee by a 9–5 vote, and then rejected in the full Senate by a 58–42 margin.|$|E

500|$|From 1942 onwards, Hergé began {{redrawing}} and colouring {{his earlier}} Tintin adventures for Casterman, but {{chose not to}} do so for Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, considering its story too crude. Embarrassed by it, he labeled it a [...] "transgression of [...] youth". Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier believed that another factor in his decision might have been the story's virulently anti-Marxist theme, which would have been unpopular amidst growing West European sympathies for Marxism following the Second World War. In an article discussing Hergé's work which was published in the magazine Jeune Afrique ("Young Africa") in 1962, it was noted that despite the fact that fans of his work visited the Bibliothèque Nationale to read the copy of Land of the Soviets that was held there, it [...] "will never (<b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>good</b> cause) be republished". In 1961, Hergé wrote a letter to Casterman suggesting that the original version of the story be republished in a volume containing a publisher's warning about its content. Louis-Robert Casterman replied with a letter in which he stated that while the subject had been discussed within the company, [...] "There are more hesitant or decidedly negative opinions than there are enthusiastic ones. Whatever the case, you can rest assured that the matter is being actively considered".|$|E
