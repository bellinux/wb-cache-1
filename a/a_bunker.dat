5|$|In {{order to}} combat these {{threats to the}} world order, the United Nations has {{expanded}} its influence around the globe to form the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO). It is headquartered near New York City in <b>a</b> <b>bunker</b> beneath Liberty Island, placed there after a terrorist strike on the Statue of Liberty.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Adolf Hitler {{decided to}} expand the Reich Chancellery (Reichskanzlei), which he {{considered}} too small for his needs. On 21 July 1935, Leonhard Gall submitted plans for a large reception hall (that {{could also be used}} as a ballroom) to be built onto the old Chancellery. The drawings were unique because of the large cellar that led a further one-and-a-half meters down to <b>a</b> <b>bunker</b> which later became known as the Vorbunker.|$|E
50|$|Other ports include Ajman Port, Fujairah Port (<b>a</b> <b>bunkering</b> port), Das Island (tanker port), Mina' Jabal Al Dhanna, Mina Al Hemreya, Mina' Saqr, and Umm al-Qaiwain Port.|$|R

5|$|Militants {{continued}} to {{fire at the}} SSG commandos from ventilation grilles in the basement. During the firefight, Abdul Rashid Ghazi {{was shot in the}} leg and was asked to surrender. However, militants in the room fired back at the SSG, and Ghazi was killed in the crossfire. Other reports say that Ghazi came out of <b>a</b> <b>bunker</b> to surrender, only to be shot by his own forces. The fighting continued until all the personnel trapped in the basement either surrendered or were killed.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} little used and trains often passed through it without stopping. Its lack of {{patronage}} coupled with {{its proximity to}} other stations resulted in its closure in 1932. During the Second World War it was used as <b>a</b> <b>bunker</b> by prime minister Winston Churchill and his War Cabinet. The station building survives today and is close to Down Street's junction with Piccadilly. Part of it is now converted to a retail outlet.|$|E
5|$|On Day 12—October 3, 2004—Sayid finds a {{peculiar}} cable {{running out of}} the ocean and into the jungle. While following it, he is caught in a trap. Sayid is suspended upside down, held by a rope, and recites the Shahadah. A mysterious French woman (Mira Furlan) cuts him down and ties him to a bed in <b>a</b> <b>bunker.</b> She asks where Alex is, but when Sayid says he does not know, she uses batteries and a cable to shock him. Sayid tells his torturer about the plane crash and the French transmission the survivors heard when they first crashed on the island. The torturer then identifies herself as Danielle Rousseau, the woman who sent out the transmission. Danielle finds a picture of a woman among Sayid's possessions, and Sayid identifies the subject as Nadia.|$|E

50|$|The {{first phase}} of the Port of Hambantota will consist of two 600m general purpose berths, <b>a</b> 310m <b>bunkering</b> berth and <b>a</b> 120m small craft berth. It will also contain <b>a</b> <b>bunkering</b> {{facility}} and tank farm which will include 8 tanks for marine fuel, 3 tanks containing aviation fuel and 3 for Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG). A 15 floor administrative complex will also be constructed as part of the project.|$|R

5|$|The Egyptians {{proceeded}} {{to clear the}} bunkers. They utilized flamethrower teams, which had a visible psychological impact on the fort's garrison. At one point, the Egyptians, {{with the help of}} a wounded Israeli prisoner, managed to secure <b>a</b> <b>bunker</b> by convincing the panicked Israelis inside to come out and surrender. Soon after losing contact with the fort, the Israelis attempted to reach it once more. By this time, Malhov was dead. A group of tanks from Baluza advanced to Lahtzanit, but the Sa'iqa company occupying the firing ramp managed to destroy two tanks, forcing the remainder to retreat. Another group of tanks and half-tracks tried to break through the southern isolation force, but were ambushed and withdrew after losing a tank.|$|E
5|$|Yet {{even as the}} Americans were {{attempting}} to clear the tunnels, heavy hand-to-hand fighting broke out above ground and Haldane was later awarded the Silver Star for his actions when he rushed <b>a</b> <b>bunker</b> while under fire armed only with a pistol, {{in order to give}} first aid to a number of wounded soldiers. His courage inspired his men to complete the assault, and ultimately helped ensure the successful evacuation of the casualties and the capture of their objective. That evening the battalions of US 3rd Infantry Brigade had completed searching their assigned area of operation, and the following morning they were withdrawn from the operation. The brigade's involvement in Crimp had been limited, losing six killed and 45 wounded, while 22 Viet Cong had been killed. It was subsequently redeployed on Operation Buckskin.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} forts, the {{garrison}} itself was heavily expanded {{during the initial}} construction years and became the largest garrison in Sweden, taking an exceptional position in Swedish military history of the 20th century; even {{at the start of}} the 21st century, Boden was the largest garrison city in the Swedish Army. Still, no other fortifications than the forts themselves were finished by 1908, and work now started to fill the holes in between them. It was realised that prepared positions were needed for the mobile batteries, and apart from those, three larger battery positions (sometimes called fästen, strongholds) were also constructed at Leåkersberget, Norra Åberget and Svedjeberget. These works were started in 1911 and were finished during the First World War. The last of the three strongholds was positioned in the mountain itself with embrasures in the mountain side, and Leåkersberget had parts of the battery position inside the mountain, but the gun emplacements outsidethe other positions were concrete fortifications above the ground, some inside <b>a</b> <b>bunker</b> and others behind a parapet.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>bunker's</b> door must be {{at least}} as strong as the walls. In bunkers {{inhabited}} for prolonged periods, large amounts of ventilation or air conditioning must be provided. Bunkers can be destroyed with powerful explosives and bunker-busting warheads.|$|R
5000|$|The {{construction}} of the Saint-Nazaire submarine base was commenced in 1941, including <b>a</b> <b>bunkered</b> lock. (But {{it should be noted}} that elsewhere in the reference, it states that [...] "the excavations" [...] for the bunkered lock were begun in October 1942).|$|R
5000|$|The Bolt Head/Hope Cove RSG/SRC and <b>a</b> new <b>bunker</b> {{to replace}} Ullenwood (which was too small) at Chilmark near Salisbury — an odd choice of {{location}} as <b>a</b> different <b>bunker</b> at Chilmark {{was used by the}} RAF for storing nuclear warheads.|$|R
5|$|Designs for {{the asylum}} {{departed}} from comic interpretations {{of a large}} mansion and instead developed an entire island, with hints of Alcatraz prison, composed of multiple buildings to allow for greater variety and exploration. Each building was designed with a different architectural style to make the facility appear believable and to imbue each location with a history. The medical building was inspired by Victorian architecture and its metalwork structure was intended to inspire feelings of horror. The intensive treatment unit has a Gothic, industrial aesthetic. The catacombs beneath the facility, inspired by early twentieth-century brickwork and Victorian industry, were meant to feel oppressive. The maximum security area was designed to feel claustrophobic and was retrofitted like <b>a</b> <b>bunker,</b> and the Arkham mansion displays a High Gothic style. The designers integrated crooked lines into environmental objects, such as trees and drainpipes, where possible. 40 rooms, 34 corridors, 3 exterior areas, and 3 Scarecrow-induced hallucination areas were designed for the game.|$|E
5|$|Gases {{from the}} furnace are cleaned using {{selective}} non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), spray absorbers and active carbon injection. These processes remove nitrogen oxides, acidic gasses, dioxins and heavy metals from the plants emissions. The remaining gases are passed through fine-fabric bag filters to remove and solid particles, {{before it is}} released from the chimney. Each incineration line has its own independent stack in the chimney, and the flue gases are continuously monitored before being released. This information is relayed to the control room. The remaining fly ash from the filters contains particles from the incineration, lime from the spray absorbers, salt and carbon dust, and so is stored in a sealed silo until it is taken from the site for disposal. Incinerator bottom ash left on the incineration grate after the burning is moved by converyor to <b>a</b> <b>bunker.</b> Whilst on the conveyor, a magnet removes ferrous metal from the ash for recycling. The remaining ash is then used as an aggregate in the construction industry.|$|E
5|$|In 1882 Great Britain was {{converted}} into a sailing ship to transport bulk coal. She made her final voyage in 1886, after loading up with coal and leaving Penarth Dock for Panama on 8 February. After a fire on board en-route she was found on arrival at Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands to be damaged beyond economic repair. She was sold to the Falkland Islands Company and used, afloat, as a storage hulk (coal bunker) until 1937, when she was towed to Sparrow Cove, 3.5miles from Port Stanley, scuttled and abandoned. As <b>a</b> <b>bunker,</b> she coaled the South Atlantic fleet that defeated Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee's fleet in the First World War Battle of the Falkland Islands. In the Second World War, some of her iron was scavenged to repair , one of the Royal Navy ships that fought the Graf Spee and was badly damaged during the Battle of the River Plate.|$|E
50|$|There were twelve Stützpunkt (Strongpoint) (SP) {{areas in}} Guernsey, such as Stützpunkt Rotenstein at Fort Hommet which comprised: 4x10.5 cm casemates, 2x 60 cm searchlights, <b>an</b> MG <b>bunker,</b> <b>a</b> 4.7 cm anti tank casemate, a tobruk pit mounted with a French tank turret, <b>a</b> type R633 <b>bunker</b> {{containing}} <b>a</b> M19 automatic mortar, {{and two other}} bunkers for personnel and storage as well as barbed wire, minefields, flamethrowers and trenches. <b>A</b> type R633 <b>bunker</b> took 845m³ of concrete and 40 tons of steel to build.|$|R

5|$|Nine years later, in Monte Carlo, Bond follows Xenia Onatopp, {{a member}} of the Janus crime syndicate, who has formed a {{suspicious}} relationship with Charles Farrel, a Canadian Navy admiral. As Onatopp crushes the admiral to death with her thighs during sex, his credentials are stolen by Ourumov, who uses them to board a French Navy destroyer with Onatopp to steal a Eurocopter Tiger helicopter. Ourumov and Onatopp later fly the helicopter to <b>a</b> <b>bunker</b> in Severnaya, Siberia, where they massacre the staff and steal the control disk for the GoldenEye satellites, two Soviet electromagnetic weapon satellites from the Cold War. They program the first GoldenEye (Petya) to destroy the complex, and escape with programmer Boris Grishenko. Natalya Simonova, the lone survivor, contacts Boris and arranges to meet him in Saint Petersburg, where he betrays her to Janus.|$|E
5|$|On 20 April 1943 he was {{appointed}} commander of the SS Cavalry Division. Fegelein and his division were involved in operations against partisans in May to July 1943, which included Operation Weichsel, Operation Zeithen and Operation Seydlitz. On 17 May they annihilated a partisan group south west of Novoselki. He personally blew up <b>a</b> <b>bunker</b> in the attack. A week later, on 24 May, the division attacked another partisan strongpoint, and no prisoners were taken. During Weichsel (27 May – 10 June 1943) he reported the unit had killed 4,018 persons and deported 18,860, confiscated 21,000 cattle and destroyed 61 villages southwest of Gomel. During Zeithen (13–16 June 1943) they destroyed a further 63 villages and (under direct orders from Hitler) killed all suspected partisans. During Seydlitz (26 June – 27 July 1943) he reported the destruction of 96 additional villages, with 5,016 killed and 9,166 deported and 19,941 cattle confiscated.|$|E
5|$|On 4 June 2011, Apaches struck targets within Libya for {{the first}} time, {{destroying}} a radar site and an armed checkpoint {{near the town of}} Brega. Further precision strikes were launched by Apaches, typical targets were mobile air defenses, and were occasionally engaged by AK-47 fire from ground troops. In early June, Apaches conducted attacks on Gaddafi loyalists assaulting the town of Misrata. On 13 June, British Apaches destroyed several inflatable boats with 30mm cannon fire, believed to be Libyan Special Forces, before engaging and destroying multiple vehicles along the coastline, including an anti-aircraft system. On 25 June, in coordination with RAF Panavia Tornado strikes, Apaches attacked loyalist infantry and vehicles around Brega and its airfield. On 1 July, British Apaches were reportedly involved in a 'fierce' battle at the town of Khoms. On 2 July, Apaches destroyed several tanks and <b>a</b> <b>bunker</b> at a military camp near Zawiya. On 5 August, Apaches participated in the rebel push for the town of Zliten was reported.|$|E

5|$|The Australians {{began an}} {{intensive}} patrol program in AO Columbus and were soon fighting up to platoon-sized Viet Cong units {{in a series}} of bunker complexes. Between 25−29 January the Australians conducted reconnaissance-in-force operations and a series of minor patrol clashes followed up to the end of January. On 26 January B Company, 2 RAR/NZ fought a two-hour action against about 25 Viet Cong entrenched in <b>a</b> <b>bunker</b> system. While on the same day 9 Platoon, C Company, 2 RAR/NZ also assaulted and occupied a camp initially believed to be of similar strength and held it for 19 hours after repeated attacks from a Viet Cong force estimated to be of company strength. Meanwhile, whilst providing flank security the New Zealanders in V Company, 2 RAR/NZ engaged {{in a series of}} skirmishes which resulted in 12 Viet Cong dead and many weapons captured with two New Zealanders wounded. On 27 January there were heavier contacts still, resulting in 14 Australians wounded and one Viet Cong killed.|$|E
5|$|Before the battle, {{a section}} from the 2 RAR Medium Machine Gun Platoon had been {{stationed}} within the American perimeter near Hill 111 to provide covering fire across {{the area between}} the positions occupied by the US Marines and the Australians. Commanded by Sergeant Brian Cooper they soon found themselves {{in the thick of}} the fighting, firing their Vickers machine-guns in support of the Australian positions and to defend themselves from the weight of the Chinese main attack which fell on the Marines. Three men were wounded during the night but the machine-gunners continued to fire in support, while the remainder of the section repelled Chinese assaults from the left. Ultimately the Chinese were unable to dislodge them, with the Australians calling-in artillery on to their own positions during repeated Chinese attempts to overrun them as the US Marines withdrew past their position, leaving them isolated. When dawn came dozens of Chinese bodies were found strewn in front of the Australian machine-gunners. As the US Marines worked to clear the Chinese stragglers from their position the Australians had endeavoured to coax a Chinese soldier from <b>a</b> <b>bunker,</b> yet when he resisted they were forced to kill him with a grenade. Cooper was later awarded the Military Medal for his leadership, with the stubborn defence of the Australians contributing to the break-up of the Chinese attack which at one stage had threatened to overrun the Marine position. Large groups of Chinese remained though, occupying a number bunkers and trenches, and they were not finally dislodged by the Marines until the following afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the orders}} of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, German forces had {{constructed}} {{a large number of}} static defensive positions and obstacles. Rommel had been appointed Inspector General of Coastal Defences and commander of Army Group B, in November 1943, by order of Adolf Hitler. On his arrival he had assessed the existing defences in the region and immediately began the process of improving them, particularly those situated inland as he believed no more than thirty percent of the German defences were adequate. These anti-airborne measures consisted of planting a large number of mines to create minefields, as well as the erection of so-called Rommel's asparagus; a system of wire-braced poles up to two metres in height, a great many of which were laced with mines or other booby-traps aimed at destroying gliders and killing or wounding airborne troops. Rommel noted in his diary, following an inspection of one area, that a division had placed over 300,000 stakes in the ground to deter airborne landings, and a corps had erected over 900,000. The Merville artillery battery was a particularly heavily fortified position. From the beach, it was protected by two strongpoints that included approximately thirty bunkers as well as an observation post, and the battery itself consisted of <b>a</b> <b>bunker</b> containing the battery's command post, two blockhouses, a light flak emplacement and four casemates able to contain artillery pieces up to dimensions of 150mm. The entire battery covered an area roughly four hundred metres in diameter and was surrounded by an inner perimeter of barbed wire, a minefield, and an outer perimeter of barbed wire as well as an anti-tank ditch.|$|E
