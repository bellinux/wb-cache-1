Two full-scale <b>artificial</b> <b>soil</b> <b>test</b> sections were constructed and instrumented with moisture sensors, temperature sensors, lysimeters, and a surface weather station {{to quantify the}} rate and depth of moisture infiltration under natural precipitation events. Laboratory tests were conducted to quantify relevant engineering properties including moisture-density relationships, specific gravity, saturated hydraulic conductivity, field capacity, and water retention behavior.

40|$|High {{frequency}} {{observations of}} the stable isotopic composition of CO(2) effluxes from soil have been sparse {{due in part to}} measurement challenges. We have developed an open-system method that utilizes a flow-through chamber coupled to a tunable diode laser (TDL) to quantify the rate of soil CO(2) efflux and its delta(13) C and delta(18) O values (delta(13) C(R) and delta(18) O(R), respectively). We tested the method first in the laboratory using an <b>artificial</b> <b>soil</b> <b>test</b> column and then in a semi-arid woodland. We found that the CO(2) efflux rates of 1. 2 to 7. 3 micromol m(- 2) s(- 1) measured by the chamber-TDL system were similar to measurements made using the chamber and an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (R(2) = 0. 99) and compared well with efflux rates generated from the soil test column (R(2) = 0. 94). Measured delta(13) C and delta(18) O values of CO(2) efflux using the chamber-TDL system at 2 min intervals were not significantly different from source air values across all efflux rates after accounting for diffusive enrichment. Field measurements during drought demonstrated a strong dependency of CO(2) efflux and isotopic composition on soil water content. Addition of water to the soil beneath the chamber resulted in average changes of + 6. 9 micromol m(- 2) s(- 1), - 5. 0 per thousand, and - 55. 0 per thousand for soil CO(2) efflux, delta(13) C(R) and delta(18) O(R), respectively. All three variables initiated responses within 2 min of water addition, with peak responses observed within 10 min for isotopes and 20 min for efflux. The observed delta(18) O(R) was more enriched than predicted from temperature-dependent H(2) O-CO(2) equilibration theory, similar to other recent observations of delta(18) O(R) from dry soils (Wingate L, Seibt U, Maseyk K, Ogee J, Almeida P, Yakir D, Pereira JS, Mencuccini M. Global Change Biol. 2008; 14 : 2178). The soil chamber coupled with the TDL was found to be an effective method for capturing soil CO(2) efflux and its stable isotope composition at high temporal frequency...|$|E
40|$|Earthworms have an {{important}} role to play in turfgrass. They aerify and enrich the soil, enhance water infiltration and break down thatch. Turfgrass managers are advised to select pesticides non-hazardous to earthworms to maintain the long-term stability of a healthy turf An <b>artificial</b> <b>soil</b> <b>test</b> was used to assess the toxicity of five insecticides, used for turf grass pest management, on the Pheretima group (Megascolecidae). The recommended application rates of carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, irnidacloprid, cyfluthrin and fipronil were tested. The LC 50 values were also determined by using five dosages and a control (five replicates each) per insecticide. The dosages tested in the experiment were determined on a surface area basis. The effects of the tested insecticides on earthworm mortality, earthworm biomass and individual earthworm mass were assessed 24 hours, 48 hours and 7 days after application of the insecticides against the recommended application rate. Biomass and individual earthworm mass were also determined for dosages of the probit analysis where less than 30 % mortality occurred. Individual mass was determined by dividing the biomass with the number of earthworm survivors per time interval per insecticide. Intoxication symptoms were noted. Carbaryl and chlorpyrifos (recommended application rates), had a significant greater effect on earthworm mortality than cyfluthrin, seven days after the application of the insecticides. No other significant earthworm mortality was found. None of the insecticides had a significant influence on earthworm biomass. Cyfluthrin initially reduced individual earthworm mass, but not biomass, more than the other insecticides. Carbaryl reduced biomass more than the other insecticides for all the assessments. Carbaryl, imidacloprid and chlorpyrifos had a larger negative effect than the control, fipronil and cyfluthrin on earthworm biomass and individual earthworm mass, for the 14 and 21 day assessments. For the 24 hour interval, carbaryl was the most toxic to earthworms (lowest LC 50 of 77. 2 mg kg-I), followed by imidacloprid (155. 3 mg kg-I), cyfluthrin (350. 7 mg kg-I), chlorpyrifos (389. 9 mg kg-I) and fipronil (> 8550 mg kg-I) as the least toxic. For the 48 hour and 7 day intervals, imidacloprid was the most toxic to earthworms (LC 50 values of 5. 0 mg kg-I and 3. 0 mg kg-I respectively), followed by carbaryl (15. 7 mg kg-I; 9. 0 mg kg-I), cyfluthrin (128. 4 mg kg- 1; 110. 2 mg kg-I), chlorpyrifos (330. 0 mg kg-I; 180. 2 mg kg-I) and the least toxic was fipronil (> 8550 mg kg-I both intervals). The biomass and individual earthworm mass were negatively influenced by chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid and cyfluthrin at higher dosages than the recommended application rate. Fipronil only had a significant effect on biomass and individual earthworm mass 24 hours after application at higher dosages than the recommended application rate. The intoxication symptoms noted were impaired activity, coiled and helical configurations, bleeding prostomiums and red sores.

30|$|The Guidance {{on the use}} of {{ecotoxicity}} {{tests for}} construction products, CEN/TR 17105, refers to the chemical-specific approach and a toxicity-based approach that complement each other. For complex mixtures of unknown or undisclosed composition, direct toxicity testing is recognized as a practicable method to estimate ecotoxicity. Ecotoxicity testing can be applied to construction product eluates (aquatic tests) or to construction products mixed with <b>artificial</b> <b>soil</b> (terrestrial <b>tests).</b> The selection depends on the intended use, i.e., whether it is exposed to soil or water. In the context of harmonized specifications for construction products, currently only Germany requests data on ecotoxicity/biodegradability in certain cases [68]. The DIBt concept for assessing the impact of construction works on soil and groundwater defines the following limit (rejection) values: LID[*]>[*] 4 for the algae and daphnia tests, LID[*]>[*] 6 for the fish egg test, and LID[*]>[*] 8 for the luminescent bacteria test. No genotoxicity is allowed in eluates. These tests are demanded, if ecological safety cannot be verified by evaluating ingredients, with leaching tests combined with chemical analysis, or by comparing measured concentrations with limit values. Thus, the added value of the ecotoxicity testing of construction products is mainly due to complex products with unknown or unassessed organic ingredients.|$|R

40|$|Soils {{are highly}} complex environments {{characterized}} by a huge diversity of organisms (especially microorganisms) and chemical compounds and by complex physical structure. Because of this complexity, {{it is often difficult}} to manipulate independently the microbial community, the organic matter, the clay types, etc., and to disentangle the various processes involved in soil functioning. In this paper, we propose the use of <b>artificial</b> <b>soils</b> as a simplified and adjustable tool to disentangle <b>soil</b> processes and <b>test</b> ecological theories on microbial communities. To create an <b>artificial</b> <b>soil,</b> a protocol was designed based on commercially available clays, sand, calcium carbonates and humic acids.

These tests were designed as dose-response experiments, to evaluate adverse effects on the test plants {{on the basis of the}} model contaminant concentration or the mixture ratio of the <b>test</b> <b>soil.</b> In addition, experimental factors like illumination, watering, nutrient amendments, sowing method or pollination were caried to assess their effects on the practicability of the test and the test results. A few uncontaminated reference soils with similar properties to a given <b>test</b> <b>soil,</b> were included in the study as controls and substrate for preparing soil mixtures.

Sequentially, binary packing specimens of the <b>artificial</b> <b>soil</b> were prepared and then stabilized with 2 % of a commercial hydrated lime. Next, the specimens were submitted to permeability and quasi-static cone penetration tests, in order to determine their hydraulic conductivity and cone tip resistance. Based on the obtained results, it was concluded that: (i) in the <b>artificial</b> <b>soil,</b> an increase of D/d ratio led to an increase of cone tip resistance and decrease of hydraulic conductivity; and (ii) cementation with hydrated lime reduced the hydraulic conductivity and increased the cone tip resistance...|$|R
40|$|Biotesting of {{nanomaterials}} assumes greater {{significance and}} includes various biological models. The research {{objective is to}} study the influence of different concentrations of nanoparticles (NP) of Zinc (Zn) on propagation, survival and activity of antioxidatic enzymes of metal in Eisenia fetida in <b>artificial</b> <b>soil</b> (AS) and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). Zn nanoparticles in size of 90. 7 ± 0. 3 nМ, Z-potential 25 ± 0, 5 мV {{have been used for}} the analysis. <b>Artificial</b> <b>soil</b> and microcrystalline cellulose were used as substrates for the study. Zn nanoparticles in high concentrations (from 500 to 1000 mg/kg) cause immobilization of 60 % of earthworms within 24 hours. The highest accumulation of metal in earthworms and high mortality were registered at a concentration of 500 mg/kg in microcrystalline cellulose and at 1000 mg/kg in <b>artificial</b> <b>soil.</b> It was established that after the increase in concentration from 50 to 500 mg/kg the activity of GPx and SOD in two substrates increases. The highest activity occurs when Zn nanoparticles have concentration of 500 mg/kg. The activity of catalase in worms reduced at the exposition in MCC, but it increased after increasing dosage of Zn NPs in the <b>artificial</b> <b>soil.</b> The study demonstrates that Zn nanoparticles in dose of 500 mg/kg induced the highest toxical effect. It was proven by behavioral reactions, growth characteristics and indices of enzymatic activity in organism of redworm...|$|R
40|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>soils</b> {{have been}} {{employed}} within the Biomes of the Eden Project since its construction in 2000. Produced from sand, bark, composted green waste and lignite clay, these soils {{were designed to}} have their nutrient concentrations controlled through careful fertiliser applications. However, following variable environmental conditions, management practices and planting, the soils across the site are performing variably with regard to nutrient retention and storage. Experiments were conducted to assess the performances of an <b>artificial</b> <b>soil</b> in terms of nutrient cycling. This {{was carried out in}} three phases: Firstly, soils from the Humid Tropics and Outdoor biomes were sampled and examined, using a range of analytical techniques, to determine the nutrient characteristics of the established <b>artificial</b> <b>soils</b> from across the Eden Project site. This demonstrated that many of the nutrient concentrations of the <b>artificial</b> <b>soils</b> were consistent with those reported for naturally formed soils within comparable environments. All soil samples were of sandy loam texture (ISO 14688 - 1), with the sand-sized fraction representing > 50 % of the particle size composition. Statistical analyses suggested that management practices had a greater impact on the nutrient characteristics of <b>artificial</b> <b>soils</b> than environmental conditions. Secondly, an <b>artificial</b> <b>soil</b> was produced, following the Eden Project protocol, to examine its performance under controlled environmental conditions. This was packed into 4 columns (1 m height by 110 mm diameter), maintained at 15 ˚C and subjected to an irrigation regime for 52 weeks. Following 26 weeks of irrigation, 2 of the 4 columns were fertilised. Leachate was analysed for dissolved constituents as were solid samples of the fresh soil and of soil samples collected from the columns following 52 weeks irrigation. Leachate concentrations for all nutrients, excepting phosphate, were observed to decline over the irrigation period. Leached phosphate concentrations increased from weeks 0 to 2, and then remained relatively constant. Low nitrogen concentrations within the leachate from weeks 2 to 38 were caused by nitrogen immobilisation within the soil, whilst subsequent mineralisation resulted in increased concentrations from Week 38. Analyses of solid phase constituents determined little variation with depth. Fertiliser application demonstrated a significant (p < 0. 05) increase in leachate concentrations for some dissolved organic nitrogen and nitrate, phosphate, magnesium and calcium and a decrease in pH. Fertiliser application observations showed less prominent differences for the extracted and solid phase constituents. Thirdly, biochar was applied to the <b>artificial</b> <b>soil</b> at three concentrations (10 %, 5 % and 2 %) plus a control (0 %), to determine whether biochar application may improve nutrient characteristics of <b>artificial</b> <b>soils.</b> The biochar amended soils were packed into mesocosms and maintained at 15 ˚C for 6 weeks. In general, leachate analyses demonstrated a decrease in nutrient losses to leaching with increasing biochar concentration, highlighting the potential for improved nutrient retention within the soils.

40|$|Abstract—Effective {{evaluation}} and prediction of photovoltaic performance loss due to <b>soiling</b> requires consistent <b>test</b> methods. Natural grime accumulation is time-consuming and location-specific, and thus {{does not provide}} reproducible results across different geographic regions. Therefore, we have demonstrated a technique to apply <b>artificial</b> <b>soiling</b> with NIST-traceable compo-nents using an aerosol spray technique. This approach produces consistent soil coatings which were directly correlated to perfor-mance loss of multicrystalline Si cells in a laboratory setting. By tailoring {{the composition of the}} test blend, termed ‘standard grime’, the loss due to soiling can be effectively predicted over a range of mass loadings and soil types. I...|$|R
40|$|High {{concentrations}} of arsenic are found near gold-mine tailings. The {{most common form}} of arsenic found in soil is arsenate, which is a known toxicant. We used the standardised earthworm reproduction test for the species Eisenia andrei (E. andrei) to study the toxicity and bioavailability of arsenic-contaminated soil. Arsenic is toxic to earthworms as indicated by the decrease in survival and reproduction. Arsenic-spiked <b>artificial</b> <b>soil</b> was more toxic than arsenic-spiked field soil based on total arsenic concentration in soil. Moreover, soil from near mine tailings showed a reduced toxic effect despite its high soil arsenic concentration as compared to spiked field soil. Measurements of arsenic tissue concentrations in the earthworm indicated that uptake of arsenic into earthworm tissue was higher in spiked <b>artificial</b> <b>soil</b> as compared to spiked field soil and that the maximal body burden was 396 mug As/g dry tissue weight. However, when considering tissue arsenic concentration, spiked field soil is more toxic than spiked <b>artificial</b> <b>soil.</b> Therefore the tissue rather than soil content may better reflect the magnitude of arsenic toxicity to E. andrei...|$|R
