In penile corpus cavernosum tissue, opening of BK(C) (<b>a)</b> <b>channels</b> leads to relaxation of corporal smooth muscle which is essential during erection; however, there is little information on the role of BK(C) (<b>a)</b> <b>channels</b> located in penile vascular smooth muscle. This study was designed to investigate the involvement of BK(C) (<b>a)</b> <b>channels</b> in endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation of human intracavernous penile arteries. In human intracavernous arteries obtained in connection with transsexual operations, change of isometric force was recorded in microvascular myographs and endothelium-dependent (nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium-derived hyperpolarization (EDH) -type) and -independent (NO-donor) relaxation was measured in contracted arteries. In penile small arteries contracted with phenylephrine, acetylcholine evoked NO- and EDH-type relaxations which were sensitive to iberiotoxin, a selective blocker of BK(C) (<b>a)</b> <b>channels.</b> Iberiotoxin also inhibited relaxations induced by a NO donor, sodium nitroprusside. NS 11021, a selective opener of BK(C) (<b>a)</b> <b>channels,</b> evoked pronounced relaxations which were inhibited in the presence of iberiotoxin. NS 13558, a BK(C) (a) inactive analogue of NS 11021, failed to relax human penile small arteries. Our results show that BK(C) (<b>a)</b> <b>channels</b> are involved in both NO- and EDH-type relaxation of intracavernous penile arteries obtained from healthy men.

40|$|Cultured sensory neurons from nodose ganglia were {{investigated}} with whole-cell patch-clamp techniques and single-channel recordings {{to characterize the}} A current. Membrane depolarization from - 40 mV holding potential activated the delayed rectifier current (IK) at potentials positive to - 30 mV; this current had a sigmoidal time course and showed little or no inactivation. In most neurons, the A current was completely inactivated at the - 40 mV holding potential and required hyperpolarization to remove the inactivation; the A current was isolated by subtracting the IK evoked by depolarizations from - 40 mV from the total outward current evoked by depolarizations from - 90 mV. The decay of the A current on several neurons had complex kinetics and was fit by the sum of three exponentials whose time constants were 10 - 40 ms, 100 - 350 ms, and 1 - 3 s. At the single-channel level we found that one class of <b>channel</b> underlies the <b>A</b> current. The conductance of <b>A</b> <b>channels</b> varied with the square root of the external K concentration: it was 22 pS when exposed to 5. 4 mM K externally, the increased to 40 pS when exposed to 140 mM K externally. <b>A</b> <b>channels</b> activated rapidly upon depolarization and the latency to first opening decreased with depolarization. The open time distributions followed a single exponential and the mean open time increased with depolarization. <b>A</b> <b>channels</b> inactivate in three different modes: some <b>A</b> <b>channels</b> inactivated with little reopening and gave rise to ensemble averages that decayed in 10 - 40 ms; other <b>A</b> <b>channels</b> opened and closed {{three to four times}} before inactivating and gave rise to ensemble averages that decayed in 100 - 350 ms; still other <b>A</b> <b>channels</b> opened and closed several hundred times and required seconds to inactivate. Channels gating in all three modes contributed to the macroscopic A current from the whole cell, but their relative contribution differed among neurons. In addition, <b>A</b> <b>channels</b> could go directly from the closed, or resting, state to the inactivated state without opening, and the probability for channels inactivating in this way was greater at less depolarized voltages. In addition, <b>a</b> few <b>A</b> <b>channels</b> appeared to go reversibly from a mode where inactivation occurred rapidly to a slow mode of inactivation...|$|R
