5|$|Allosauridae {{is one of}} four {{families}} in Carnosauria; the other three are Neovenatoridae, Carcharodontosauridae and Sinraptoridae. Allosauridae has at times been proposed as ancestral to the Tyrannosauridae (which would make it paraphyletic), one recent example being Gregory S. Paul's Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, but this has been rejected, with tyrannosaurids identified <b>as</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> separate branch of theropods, the Coelurosauria. Allosauridae is the smallest of the carnosaur families, with only Saurophaganax and a currently unnamed French allosauroid accepted as possible valid genera besides Allosaurus in the most recent review. Another genus, Epanterias, is a potential valid member, but it and Saurophaganax {{may turn out to be}} large examples of Allosaurus. Recent reviews have kept the genus Saurophaganax and included Epanterias with Allosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Handley {{served as}} coach for two mediocre seasons (1991–92), {{in which the}} Giants went from Super Bowl champions to a 6–10 record. He was fired {{following}} the 1992 season and replaced by former Denver Broncos coach Dan Reeves. In the early 1990s, Simms and Taylor played out {{the last years of}} their career with steadily declining production. In 1993, however, the Giants experienced a resurgent season with Reeves at the helm, and Simms and Taylor ended their careers <b>as</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> winning team.|$|E
5|$|Reservoir Dogs is a 1992 American crime {{film and}} the feature-length debut of writer and {{director}} Quentin Tarantino. It features Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn, Lawrence Tierney, Tim Roth, Tarantino, and criminal-turned-author Edward Bunker <b>as</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> botched diamond heist. The film depicts the events {{before and after the}} heist. Kirk Baltz, Randy Brooks and Steven Wright also play supporting roles. It incorporates many themes that have become Tarantino's hallmarks: violent crime, pop culture references, profanity, and nonlinear storytelling.|$|E

5|$|A Passover Seder is {{a ritual}} meal held by Jews {{on the first}} two nights of the Passover holiday (first night only in Israel). The Seder is {{traditionally}} conducted in the home by the family and their invited guests, although it may also be held by any group of Jews, such <b>as</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> synagogue, condominium complex, student group, army base, etc. At the Seder, participants read the Haggadah, a ritual text recounting the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. The reading is accompanied by visual aids {{in the form of the}} symbolic foods on the Passover Seder Plate. A festive meal is part of the ritual. While religious Jewish law places certain restrictions on a non-Jew eating at a Seder, non-traditional Jews often invite non-Jews to their Seders, and non-Jews also conduct Seders of their own.|$|E
5|$|Each {{successive}} rank {{gave its}} holder greater pensions and legal privileges. The highest rank, of full marquess, {{came with a}} state pension and a territorial fiefdom. Holders of the rank immediately below, that of ordinary marquess, received a pension, but had no territorial rule. Officials who served in government belonged to the wider commoner social class and were ranked just below nobles in social prestige. The highest government officials could be enfeoffed as marquesses. By the Eastern Han period, local elites of unattached scholars, teachers, students, and government officials began to identify themselves <b>as</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> larger, nationwide gentry class with shared values {{and a commitment to}} mainstream scholarship. When the government became noticeably corrupt in mid-to-late Eastern Han, many gentrymen even considered the cultivation of morally grounded personal relationships more important than serving in public office.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of archbishop was usually {{held by a}} scion of nobility, and not necessarily a priest; this widespread practice allowed younger sons of noble houses to find prestigious and financially secure positions without the requirements of priesthood. The archbishop and prince-elector was chosen by the cathedral chapter, the members of which also served as his advisers. <b>As</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cathedral chapter, they participated in the Mass, or sang the Mass; in addition, they performed other duties as needed. They {{were not required to}} be priests but they could, if they wished, take Holy Orders. As prebendaries, they received stipends from cathedral income; depending on the location and wealth of the cathedral, this could amount to substantial annual income. In the Electorate, the Chapter included 24canons of various social ranks; they each had a place in the choir, based on their rank, which in turn was usually derived from the social standing of their families.|$|E

25|$|The spatial {{patterning}} {{of grave}} good types also differs {{from those of}} the Early Anglo-Saxon period, as smaller regional distributions were replaced by larger ones.

The U.S. Navy had {{undergone}} an organizational change {{in the second year}} of the war, one feature of which was the creation of the rank of Rear Admiral.

25|$|Quakers, or Friends, {{are members}} of a family of {{religious}} movements collectively known as the Religious Society of Friends.

They include those with evangelical, holiness, liberal, and traditional conservative Quaker understandings of Christianity. Unlike many other groups that emerged within Christianity, the Religious Society of Friends has actively tried to avoid creeds and hierarchical structures.|$|E

25|$|As a {{minority}} group within Israeli society, the Bedouin are a marginalized group. Within this culture, women {{are said to}} be marginalized twice. They are marginalized once for being a Bedouin and a second time for being a woman. Marginalization as a Bedouin is common to both men and women, <b>as</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minority group. The marginalization as a woman stems from traditional gender norms and expectations within Negev Bedouin society. This marginalization manifests itself in employment, educational, and health care outcomes.|$|E

Basic family values include interdependence, responsibility for others, sharing of work and resources, obedience, and respect. Children assume important family responsibilities early and act <b>as</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sibling workforce that is held collectively responsible for completing tasks.|$|E
25|$|Although Nazi {{doctrine}} {{stressed the}} importance of physiognomy and genes in determining race, in practice race was determined only through the religions followed by each individual's ancestors. Individuals were considered non-Aryan (i.e. Jewish) if at least three of four of their grandparents had been enrolled <b>as</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Jewish congregation; it did not matter if those grandparents had been born to a Jewish family or had converted to Judaism in adulthood. The actual religious beliefs of the individual himself or herself were also immaterial, as was the individual's status under Halachic law.|$|E

30|$|For {{individuals}} who indicate {{being able to}} speak an indigenous language, the questionnaire also asks them {{if they have the}} ability to speak Spanish. We find that 79.35 % of the individuals ages 16 to 64 not attending school and that report being able to speak an indigenous language also can speak Spanish. We use this information to build the indicator variables for Table 3, which are monolingual-indigenous, monolingual Spanish and bilingual. We drop from the sample {{individuals who}} are monolingual indigenous but do not self-identify <b>as</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> indigenous group. <b>A</b> comparison <b>of</b> the summary statistics reveal that these individuals are very similar to monolingual-indigenous who self-identify <b>as</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> indigenous group and not to those who do not self-identify <b>as</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> indigenous group. Hence, we believe that these individuals did not understand the question correctly. Only 1990 individuals are in this situation, and from them only 678 have valid observations so they could have been used in the estimation sample. The results are basically identical if we include or exclude these individuals.|$|R
