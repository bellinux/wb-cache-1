5|$|Martínez Pérez {{was murdered}} {{early in the}} morning of 28 April 2012 in her home in the Felipe Carrillo Puerto {{neighborhood}} in Xalapa, the capital of Veracruz. When police went to her home to investigate in response to a neighbor's call about her door being open all day, Martínez Pérez's corpse was found on the bathroom floor. According to official reports, she had been severely beaten <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> and ribs, and then strangled to death. The cause of death was asphyxia by strangulation. At the time of her death, the Mexican authorities said they were investigating all the possible motives behind her assassination, including personal motives and theft, and that they would investigate whether the killing was work-related.|$|E
500|$|The episode's musical style varies significantly. Buffy's opening number, [...] "Going Through the Motions", was {{influenced}} heavily by the Disney song [...] "Part of Your World" [...] sung by Ariel in The Little Mermaid. Whedon {{wanted to use}} a similar opening in which the heroine explains her yearning. While singing her song, Buffy fights three vampires and a demon who themselves break into a choreographed dance; Whedon wanted this to be fun but not distracting. The song ends with chord influences from Stephen Schwartz's Pippin and a visual tribute to Disney: as Buffy stakes a vampire, it turns to dust that swirls <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
2500|$|When {{using her}} telepathic powers, a butterfly-shaped energy aura would appear <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> It was never truly made {{clear in the}} comic books by the writers whether this was {{something}} that could be perceived by others or if this was simply an [...] "effect" [...] to show when Psylocke was using her powers to the reading audience (although it was implied that it could be). This [...] "butterfly" [...] (sometimes depicted as having eyes in its wings) was also the form Psylocke usually took when manifesting her astral form, both on the astral plane, and in the physical world, although she occasionally used an illusory image of her physical body. After her transformation, Psylocke's psi-form changed accordingly.|$|E
60|$|The girl {{drew her}} shawl {{a little closer}} <b>around</b> <b>her</b> shoulders. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> bore upon it the terrible stamp of suffering, without its redeeming purification. Save for her {{abundant}} hair, her very sex would have been unrecognisable. She looked steadily at Maraton.|$|R
60|$|Tasso {{snapped the}} gun together. She studied the heaps of rubble <b>around</b> them, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> expressionless. As {{if she were}} {{watching}} for something.|$|R
60|$|The {{conductor}} saw the brakeman {{looking at}} him {{and in order to}} convey the impression that he was getting on nicely he bent forward and looked <b>around</b> into <b>her</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm so glad!" [...] {{came from}} little Nell, as she brushed back the curls that were flying <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> [...] "Mrs. Thompson is so nice! She {{can tell the}} cutest stories!" ...|$|E
60|$|Through one of {{the tiny}} windows there peeped a {{flickering}} light. Taurus Antinor marvelled if that were her sleeping-room and, closing his eyes, pictured her there, resting on embroidered coverlets and cushions, her fair hair falling in waves <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> at rest; and he wondered whether in sleep a dewy tear had perchance put a priceless diamond on her golden lashes.|$|E
6000|$|Once, as {{they were}} talking, Moses {{looked up and saw}} Mara's head, as a stray sunbeam falling upon the golden hair seemed to make a halo <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Her large eyes were fixed upon him with an {{expression}} so intense and penetrative, that he felt a sort of wincing uneasiness. [...] "What makes you look at me so, Mara?" [...] he said, suddenly.|$|E
60|$|His arm was {{suddenly}} <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> his <b>face</b> hideously close. He {{gave a little}} snarl as he felt the pinprick through his shirt sleeve. Then he went spinning round and round with {{his hand to his}} head.|$|R
60|$|His {{arms were}} <b>around</b> <b>her</b> waist. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> was turned away, {{but he saw}} the glitter of a tear in her eyes, {{and he was very}} bold. He kissed it away.|$|R
50|$|In 1974, Choy {{directed}} her first documentary, which was called Teach Our Children. After working at Newsreel, {{she moved to}} a branch called Third World Newsreel. Because Choy was able {{to relate to the}} poverty and the migration issues that people <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>faced,</b> she was inspired to make another documentary, that fused the issues she faced while back in China and South Korea with the struggles she faced in the U.S. She finished the film, From Spikes to Spindles, in 1976. This film focused on Chinese migration, and focused on Chinese citizens being treated equally.|$|R
6000|$|Yet along o' them novels, you see, she was wastin' and mopin' away, [...] And {{then she}} got shy with her tongue, and at last she had nothin' to [...] say; [...] And {{whenever}} I happened <b>around,</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> it was hid by a book, [...] And it warn't till the day she left that she give me ez much ez a [...] look.|$|E
60|$|He led the {{way down}} the lane, the two women {{following}} together. Jessamine thought she must be in a pleasant dream. The whole afternoon was a feast of delight to her starved heart. When sunset came she sat down, tired out, but radiant, on the porch steps. Her hat had slipped back and her hair was curling <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Her dark eyes were aglow; the roses still bloomed in her cheeks.|$|E
60|$|Prissy {{herself was}} a pretty girl--at least most people thought so. I can't {{honestly}} say I ever admired her style much myself. I like something with more vim and snap to it. Prissy was slim and pink, with soft, appealing blue eyes, and pale gold hair all clinging in baby rings <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> She was just as meek and timid as she looked and there wasn't a bit of harm in her. I always liked Prissy, even if I didn't admire her looks as much as some people did.|$|E

60|$|She {{concluded}} with <b>her</b> arms <b>around</b> my neck, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> upturned to mine and temptingly close, her eyes greatly solemn and greatly promising.|$|R
6000|$|She {{rushed into}} his embrace, and {{throwing}} <b>her</b> arms <b>around</b> him, buried <b>her</b> <b>face</b> upon his breast. 'Alaric, Alaric, my husband! my love, my best, my own, my only love!' ...|$|R
60|$|While the pursuivant gave Wayland this {{pressing}} yet uncourteous invitation, which, for {{a minute}} or two, he could not imagine was applied to him, the yeomen speedily made a free passage for him, while, only cautioning his companion to keep the muffler close <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> he entered the gate leading her palfrey, but with such a drooping crest, and such a look of conscious fear and anxiety, that the crowd, not greatly pleased at any rate with the preference bestowed upon them, accompanied their admission with hooting and a loud laugh of derision.|$|E
6000|$|When Rowena {{perceived}} the Knight Templar's eyes bent on {{her with an}} ardour, that, compared with the dark caverns under which they moved, gave them the effect of lighted charcoal, she drew with dignity the veil <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> as an intimation that the determined freedom of his glance was disagreeable. Cedric saw the motion and its cause. [...] "Sir Templar," [...] said he, [...] "the cheeks of our Saxon maidens have seen too little of the sun {{to enable them to}} bear the fixed glance of a crusader." ...|$|E
60|$|Clarence looked. Susy had {{crawled out}} of the mesquite, and with her sun-bonnet hanging down her back, her curls tossed <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> still flushed with sleep, and Clarence's jacket over her shoulders, was gazing up with grave {{satisfaction}} in the laughing eyes {{of one of the}} men who was with outstretched hands bending over her. Could he believe his senses? The terror-stricken, willful, unmanageable Susy, whom he would have translated unconsciously to safety without this terrible ordeal of being awakened to the loss of her home and parents at any sacrifice to himself--this ingenuous infant was absolutely throwing herself with every appearance of forgetfulness into the arms of the first new-comer! Yet his perception of this fact was accompanied by no sense of ingratitude. For her sake he felt relieved, and with a boyish smile of satisfaction and encouragement vaulted into the saddle before the stranger.|$|E
5000|$|... "Mary Magdelene" [...] (1994), a {{sculpture}} made of silicon bronze and forged steel, {{is an example}} of Smith's non-traditional use of the female nude. The figure is without skin everywhere but <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> breasts and the area surrounding her navel. She wears a chain <b>around</b> <b>her</b> ankle; <b>her</b> <b>face</b> is relatively undetailed and is turned upwards. Smith has said that when making Mary Magdalene she was inspired by depictions of Mary Magdalene in Southern German sculpture, where she was depicted as a [...] "wild woman". Smith's sculpture [...] "Standing" [...] (1998), featuring a female figure standing atop the trunk of a Eucalyptus tree, {{is a part of the}} Stuart Collection of public art on the campus of the University of California, San Diego.|$|R
6000|$|Mara {{lay with}} her large {{eyes fixed on}} the now faded sky. The dusky shadows had dropped like a black crape veil <b>around</b> <b>her</b> pale <b>face.</b> In a few moments she {{repeated}} to herself, as if she were musing upon them, those mysterious words of Him who liveth and was dead, [...] "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit." ...|$|R
500|$|On April 21, 1913, Phagan {{was laid}} off due to a {{shortage}} of brass sheet metal. Around noon on April 26, {{she went to the}} factory to claim her pay of $1.20. The next day, shortly before 3:00a.m., the factory's night watchman, Newt Lee, went to the factory basement to use the toilet. After leaving the toilet, Lee discovered Phagan's body {{in the rear of the}} basement near an incinerator and called the police. Her dress was up <b>around</b> <b>her</b> waist and a strip from her petticoat had been torn off and wrapped <b>around</b> <b>her</b> neck. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> was blackened and scratched, and her head was bruised and battered. A [...] strip of [...] wrapping cord was tied into a loop <b>around</b> <b>her</b> neck, buried [...] deep, showing that she had been strangled. Her underwear was still <b>around</b> <b>her</b> hips, but stained with blood and torn open. Her skin was covered with ashes and dirt from the floor, initially making it appear to responding officers that she and her assailant had struggled in the basement.|$|R
60|$|In her {{person and}} her dress she was perfect, and well {{she knew her}} own perfection. She was a small, elegantly made old woman, with a face from which the glow of her youth had not {{departed}} without leaving some streaks of a roseate hue. She was proud of her colour, proud of her grey hair which she wore in short crisp curls peering out all <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> from her dainty white lace cap. To {{think of all the}} money that she spent in lace used to break the heart of poor Mrs. Quiverful with her seven daughters. She was proud of her teeth, which were still white and numerous, proud of her bright cheery eye, proud of her short jaunty step; and very proud of the neat, precise, small feet with which those steps were taken. She was proud also, ay, very proud, of the rich brocaded silk in which it was her custom to ruffle through her drawing-room.|$|E
60|$|Her {{hair was}} unloosened, and {{streamed}} {{over her shoulders}} in such length, that much of it lay upon the ground, and in such quantity, that it formed a dark veil, or shadow, not only <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> but over her whole slender and minute form. From the profusion of her tresses looked forth her small and dark, but well-formed features, together with the large and brilliant black eyes; and her whole countenance was composed into the imploring look of one who is doubtful of the reception {{she is about to}} meet with from a valued friend, while she confesses a fault, pleads an apology, or solicits a reconciliation. In short, the whole face was so much alive with expression, that Julian, though her aspect was so familiar to him, could hardly persuade himself but that her countenance was entirely new. The wild, fantastic, elvish vivacity of the features, seemed totally vanished, and had given place to a sorrowful, tender, and pathetic cast of countenance, aided by the expression of the large dark eyes, which, as they were turned up towards Julian, glistened with moisture, that, nevertheless, did not overflow the eyelids.|$|E
60|$|She is {{not quite}} of a middle height, with {{something}} beautiful and child-like about the moulding of her delicate form. We still see those sad, wistful, hazel eyes, over which the lids droop with a dreamy languor, and whose dark lustre contrasts singularly with the golden hue of the abundant hair which waves in a thousand rippling undulations <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> The impression she produces is not that of paleness, {{though there is no}} color in her cheek; but her complexion has everywhere that delicate pink tinting which one sees in healthy infants, and with the least emotion brightens into a fluttering bloom. Such a bloom is on her cheek at this moment, as she is working away, copying a bunch of scarlet rock-columbine which is in a wine-glass of water before her; every few moments stopping and holding her work at a distance, to contemplate its effect. At this moment there steps behind her chair a tall, lithe figure, a face with a rich Spanish complexion, large black eyes, glowing cheeks, marked eyebrows, and lustrous black hair arranged in shining braids around her head. It is our old friend, Sally Kittridge, whom common fame calls the handsomest girl of all the region round Harpswell, Maquoit, and Orr's Island. In truth, a wholesome, ruddy, blooming creature she was, the sight of whom cheered and warmed one like a good fire in December; and she seemed to have enough and to spare of the warmest gifts of vitality and joyous animal life. She had a well-formed mouth, but rather large, and a frank laugh which showed all her teeth sound--and a fortunate sight it was, considering that they were white and even as pearls; and the hand that she laid upon Mara's at this moment, though twice as large as that of the little artist, was yet in harmony with her vigorous, finely developed figure.|$|E
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Miss Harnett, a historian, Long Beach, [s. d. ]. The bust of Miss Harnett sports a button-decorated top with epaulets, {{from which the}} collar of a finely-dotted turtleneck shirt extends. Ms. Harnett wears a brooch on the turtleneck and a necklace <b>around</b> <b>her</b> neck. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> seems relatively young to middle-aged, and is augmented by glasses. Her hair is up, but promises to be roughly shoulder-length...|$|R
40|$|Composite {{image of}} a Walapai Indian woman holding a baby, [s. d. ]. The woman sits at center in a floral-patterned dress with a large, striped blanket hanging from her {{shoulders}} and falling to the dusty earth beneath her. Her dark hair hangs <b>around</b> <b>her</b> smiling <b>face</b> as she gently holds the baby {{in her lap and}} looks towards the foreground. The baby is dressed in a lightly-colored outfit as it stares in a daze towards the foreground. Trees stand with bushes below them in the background...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{wait here}} a moment," [...] said Cissy, brightening. She flew up the staircase. In {{a few minutes}} she was back again. She had {{exchanged}} her smart rose-sprigged chintz for a pathetic little blue-checked frock of her school-days; the fateful hat {{had given way to}} a brown straw [...] "flat," [...] bent like a frame <b>around</b> <b>her</b> charming <b>face.</b> All the girlishness, and indeed a certain honest boyishness of her nature, seemed to have come out in her glowing, freckled cheek, brilliant, audacious eyes, and the quick stride which brought her to Ah Fe's side.|$|R
60|$|It {{was neither}} the {{intention}} nor {{the policy of}} the English commander to pursue his success, for he well knew that strong parties of the Americans would soon arrive; accordingly he only tarried to collect his wounded, and forming in a square, he commenced his retreat towards the shipping. Within twenty minutes of the fall of Lawton, the ground was deserted by both English and Americans. When the inhabitants of the country were called upon to enter the field, they were necessarily attended by such surgical advisers as were furnished by the low state of the profession in the interior at that day. Dr. Sitgreaves entertained quite as profound a contempt for the medical attendants of the militia as the captain did of the troops themselves. He wandered, therefore, around the field, casting many a glance of disapprobation at the slight operations that came under his eye; but when, among the flying troops, he found that his comrade and friend was nowhere to be seen, he hastened back to the spot at which Hollister was posted, to inquire if the trooper had returned. Of course, the answer was in the negative. Filled with a thousand uneasy conjectures, the surgeon, without regarding, or indeed without at all reflecting upon any dangers that might lie in his way, strode over the ground at an enormous rate, {{to the point where he}} knew the final struggle had been. Once before, the surgeon had rescued his friend from death in a similar situation; and he felt a secret joy in his own conscious skill, as he perceived Betty Flanagan seated on the ground, holding in her lap the head of a man whose size and dress he knew could belong only to the trooper. As he approached the spot, the surgeon became alarmed at the aspect of the washerwoman. Her little black bonnet was thrown aside, and her hair, which was already streaked with gray, hung <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> in disorder.|$|E
50|$|Sir Bounteous' servant, Gunwater, tells Bounteous {{that the}} Courtesan has arrived—but {{there might be}} a problem: she has a linen cloth tied <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> (this 'Courtesan' is, in fact, Follywit in disguise). Excited by the {{prospect}} of a sexual rendezvous with the Courtesan, Bounteous disregards the linen cloth and tells Gunwater to prepare the bedroom.|$|E

60|$|One day Ned Bennett {{dropped in}} and said that John Osborne would start for the west in three days. That evening Nan went up {{to her room and}} dressed herself in the prettiest dress she owned, combed <b>her</b> hair <b>around</b> <b>her</b> {{sparkling}} <b>face</b> in bewitching curls, pinned a cluster of apple blossoms at her belt, and, thus equipped, marched down in the golden sunset light to the Mill Creek Bridge. John Osborne, on his return from Thornhope half an hour later, found her there, leaning over the rail among the willows.|$|R
5000|$|As each [...] "Anne" [...] {{interacts with}} the locals, {{including}} Won-joo, who works at Anne's lodging and helps show <b>her</b> <b>around,</b> certain <b>faces,</b> situations and lines of dialogue recur, their effect and implications changing depending on context and delivery.|$|R
50|$|Later {{known as}} the Elling Woman, the body was {{discovered}} by a local farmer, Jens Zakariasson, who at first believed that the remains were of a drowned animal. The body was wrapped in a sheepskin cape with a leather cloak tied <b>around</b> <b>her</b> legs. The <b>face</b> of the woman was poorly preserved, {{and there were no}} traces of organs inside of the body.|$|R
