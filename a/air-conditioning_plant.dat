The experimental tests are performed in a plant consisting in a water-cooled vapor-compression circuit employed for cooling a water-glycol mixture in a closed-loop system.

While most reported works were conducted on residential heat pumps with evaporating temperature below zero degree Celsius, this study considers higher evaporating temperatures, from 5 to 35 degrees Celsius. The comparison was made by theoretical cycle calculation with variable heating and cooling capacities and at different temperatures. The experimental results of R 407 C were compared with the existing R 22 refrigerant to explore the potential for retrofitting existing installations. It has been found that both the thermodynamic properties and general performance of R 407 C are comparable with that of R 22. The operational behavior of R 407 C was found better with the increasing condensation and evaporation temperature. It has also been observed that the heating capacity of the refrigerant R 407 C is 5 higher than that of R 22. When the compression ratio exceeds 3, at high evaporating temperatures, the coefficient of performance with R 407 C is greater than that obtained with R 22. Therefore, R 407 C is a good substitute for R 22 in all applications requiring high evaporation temperatures, such as <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>plants</b> and heat pumps for heat recovery...|$|R

40|$|Replacement of {{air-cooled}} chillers with water-cooled chillers for <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>plants</b> {{in existing}} buildings can yield {{a significant amount}} of energy savings, especially in a sub-tropical climate. However, due to variations in weather conditions and building operation patterns, the amount of actual energy saving is often uncertain in these retrofits. These uncertainties impose a risk of saving shortfalls when Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) guarantee building owners for a certain amount of energy savings in Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) projects. This study presents a probabilistic approach to estimating a range of possible energy savings with the associated confidence levels for chiller replacement in existing buildings, taking into account the annual variations in the influential parameters affecting energy savings. The influential factors include building cooling loads, system control and operation systems, as well as chiller plant characteristics. The proposed approach involves: the use of correlation analysis for identifying influential parameters; EnergyPlus for simulating energy use of chiller plant; and a Monte Carlo approach for simulating the probability of post-retrofit energy savings. A commercial building where the air-cooled chillers were replaced with water-cooled chillers is used to illustrate the proposed approach. Results show that the variations in annual energy savings for chiller replacement projects can be estimated with a defined degree of certainty. In the case study project, the possible annual energy savings during the post-retrofit period range from 1, 149, 000 kWh (37. 6 % of baseline consumption) to 1, 504, 000 kWh (49. 2 % of ditto) at 90 % statistical significance.

40|$|The use {{of solar}} thermal energy for air {{conditioning}} in buildings has gained interest in the last years. In particular the attention focused on solutions {{which could lead to}} the realisation of solar driven de-centralised systems. Technologies implementing thermodynamic open cycles result often suitable for coupling with market available solar systems, since low temperature heat can drive the process. The disadvantage of such systems is the thermodynamic limit of the cycle employed which diminishes the possibility to employ the technology in any condition. Among them the desiccant and evaporative cooling (DEC) systems have been widely studied, for large size <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>plants</b> with compulsory ventilation. But DEC air-conditioning systems are not suitable small size applications, due to technical problems and high costs. A new desiccant-cooling concept (i. e., ECOS) has been developed and is here briefly presented. It is based on a combination of cooled sorption and continuous indirect adiabatic cooling processes. The component where the cycle takes place is derived from a conventional cross flow air-to-air heat exchanger. The cycle offers the chance to overcome the disadvantages of sorption open cycles. The thermodynamic analysis of the cycle and the experimental tests reveals that ECOS extends the range of application in comparison to other implementations of open cycles and moreover performs particularly well in the range of climatic conditions critical for DEC systems (i. e., hot humid climates). During the work reported on this paper an analysis of the performance of the cycle, in terms of COP, has been carried out. Furthermore the efficiency of the whole system (solar and ECOS) has been worked out through the investigation of the SCOP (Solar Coefficient of Performance) characterising the system.
