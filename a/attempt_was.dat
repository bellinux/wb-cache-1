5|$|On 31 January, an <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> made to free Missouri {{with the}} {{assembled}} collection of tug boats and salvage ships. This <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> ultimately unsuccessful, owing to an anchor {{from a previous}} wreck that had become embedded in Missouris hull. The extreme force generated by the tugs caused several two-inch cables made from wire rope to break, and the failed attempt also revealed that Missouri needed to lose more weight if the next <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> to be successful. In light of this, some additional changes were made for the next attempt, which included cutting the anchors and chains off the battleship—after they had been re-added at Wallin's request—and the inclusion of additional pontoons to help lighten Missouri even more. A second <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> tentatively scheduled for 1 February.|$|E

5|$|From 1513, Petar Kružić {{was one of}} the {{commanding}} officers of Klis Fortress. The Ottomans attempted to conquer the Klis Fortress on several occasions. The first major <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> by Skender-beg Ornosović in 1515. The Ottomans captured Klis, a village just below the fortress bearing the same name, but the garrison in the fortress above held. Kružić was promoted to captain of the Klis Fortress by the ban Petar Berislavić in 1520. The second major <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> in 1520, and a year later another <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> made by Makut-paša, with additional 2,000 infantry, 50 horsemen and siege equipment. Another unsuccessful <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> made in 1522, by Hasan-paša from Mostar and Mehmed-beg Mihalbegović. Later that year, Mihalbegović made another attempt at a siege with 3,000 men, but failed again. During 1523, Klis Fortress was again under attack by the Sultan's army. Attempts were also made by Gazi Husrev-beg in 1526 and 1528, and later in 1531 and 1532.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, an <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> made {{to revive}} If as a semiprofessional magazine. The only issue, dated September–October 1986, was edited by Clifford Hong.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 an <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> made {{to extract}} a {{mitochondrial}} DNA sequence from the skeletal remains of C.d.guildayi to compare {{its relationship to}} other Canis species. The <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> unsuccessful because these remains {{had been removed from}} the LaBrea pits and tar could not be removed from the bone material. In 2014 an attempt to extract DNA from a Columbian mammoth from the tar pits also failed, with the study concluding that organic compounds from the asphalt permeate the bones of all ancient samples from the LaBrea pits, hindering the extraction of DNA samples.|$|E
50|$|Each penal {{provision}} in the Norwegian criminal code specifies if it is criminal to aid and abet. Further, when the <b>attempt</b> <b>is</b> criminal, participating in that <b>attempt</b> <b>is</b> criminal.|$|R

5|$|To {{assist in}} {{speeding}} up the ship's construction, the internal hull structure was simplified {{as much as possible}} and an <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> made to standardize on a limited number of standard plates, which varied only in their thickness.|$|E
5|$|A Bulldog Drummond {{radio series}} {{ran on the}} Mutual Broadcasting System from 13 April 1941 to 12 January 1949. An <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> made at a revival between 3 January and 28 March 1954. Drummond was {{initially}} portrayed by George Coulouris, before being taken over by Santos Ortega and Ned Wever after 1942; Cedric Hardwicke took over in 1954.|$|E
25|$|<b>Attempts</b> have <b>been</b> made {{to combine}} {{aspects of the}} Kharkiv and Kyiv banduras into a unified instrument. The first <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> made by the Honcharenko {{brothers}} in Germany in 1948. <b>Attempts</b> <b>were</b> made in the 1960s by Ivan Skliar, in the 1980s by V. Herasymenko, and more recently by Bill Vetzal in Canada.|$|R
5000|$|A 2005 review {{observed}} that suicide <b>attempts</b> <b>are</b> increased {{in those who}} use SSRIs as compared to placebo and compared to therapeutic interventions other than tricyclic antidepressants.

50|$|In Ukraine <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> made {{to bring}} the Kharkiv bandura's {{construction}} into line with the developments in the Kiev concert bandura. These <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> initially made by Perekop Ivanov and Ivan Skliar and resulted {{in the development of}} the Kiev-Kharkiv bandura which did not have a residing success. In recent times Vasyl Herasymenko in Lviv has made attempt to revive the instrument. <b>Attempts</b> <b>were</b> also made to have instruments serially manufactured in the Melnytso-Podilsk Musical instrument workshop.|$|R
5|$|A £40 million {{contract}} to build 27 Urbos 3 trams, sufficient for phase 1a and (unbuilt) 1b lines, {{was awarded to}} CAF. When the line was cut back to York Place, only 17 trams would be needed. An unsuccessful <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> made in 2011 to lease ten trams to Transport for London for use on Tramlink.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{football}} club {{was formed in}} 1875, it was not incorporated until 1903. The club remained a private company until 1988, when it was publicly listed on the London Stock Exchange. This public listing, combined with poor financial performance, made Hibs vulnerable to an attempted takeover in 1990 by Hearts chairman Wallace Mercer. This <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> averted when Mercer was unable to acquire the 75% shareholding needed to liquidate the company.|$|E
5|$|An <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> made {{to provide}} the {{completed}} Arrows to the National Research Council of Canada as high-speed test aircraft. The NRC refused, noting that without sufficient spare parts and maintenance, as well as qualified pilots, the NRC could make no use of them. A similar project initiated by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (Boscombe Down) had resulted in Avro vice-president (engineering) Jim Floyd's preparing a transatlantic ferry operation. This proposal, like others from the United States, was never realized.|$|E
50|$|Several <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> made in 1959, 1968 and 1997 to {{introduce}} Sinhala braille contractions. But, {{none of these}} <b>attempts</b> can <b>be</b> observed today.|$|R

5|$|Another <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> made {{to collect}} a {{specimen}} by Lord Crawford on his yacht Valhalla in 1905. A final <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> made during the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition, which passed by in April 1922 on its way back to Britain. This visit also failed, but members of the expedition left collecting material with a Rev. H. M. C. Rogers, then chaplain on Tristan da Cunha. The following year two study skins arrived in the Natural History Museum, London, followed soon after by another skin and a specimen in spirits. Physician Percy Lowe was then {{able to use the}} skins to describe the species. He did so, briefly, {{at a meeting of the}} British Ornithologists' Club, in 1923.|$|E
5|$|Appalachian State {{continued}} their drive but {{were forced to}} punt after being stopped on 3rd down. Michigan began their drive at the Appalachian State 34-yard line, but a Henne pass was intercepted by Mountaineer defender Leonard Love on the fourth play of the drive. Love returned the ball 26-yards, and Appalachian State began the drive at their own 41-yard line, but were forced to punt after going three-and-out. Michigan got the ball at their own 24-yard line and mounted a nine-play, 43-yard drive to the Appalachian State 33-yard line. On the final play, a fourth and five, Henne's pass fell incomplete, turning the ball over to Appalachian State, who were again quickly forced to punt. After returning the punt to their own 46-yard line, Hart ran the ball 54yards for a touchdown, giving Michigan the lead 32–31 with 4:36 left. Michigan chose to go for two, but the conversion attempt failed. Edwards was picked off on the first play of the ensuing drive, giving Michigan control of the ball at the Appalachian State 43-yard line. Michigan ran five plays before attempting a 43-yard field goal. The <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> blocked, however, giving Appalachian State control of the ball with 1:37 left. With no timeouts left, the Mountaineers drove 69yards down the field in just over a minute in game time, setting up a Rauch field goal from 24yards out with 26seconds left. The <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> good, giving Appalachian State a 34–32 lead. Michigan regained control of {{the ball on the}} ensuing kickoff, and a 46-yard pass from Henne to Mario Manningham gave the Wolverines a 37-yard field goal attempt with six seconds left on the clock. The <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> blocked by Corey Lynch, securing a 34–32 win by the Mountaineers.|$|E
5|$|At this time, the {{existing}} infantry battalions of the Citizens Force were redesignated {{to perpetuate the}} numerical designations of the AIF, and although an <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> made to allocate these designations based on regional considerations, ultimately this was not always possible and ultimately when the 3rd Division was re-established, only two of its component battalions—the 37th and 39th Battalions—had previously been assigned to the division.|$|E
50|$|Knowing {{additional}} weapons <b>were</b> needed, numerous <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> made {{to procure}} arms {{from outside the}} country. Approximately 45 <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> made to bring weapons and supplies in from outside the country. Of these, only one <b>attempt</b> <b>is</b> known to have succeeded while the rest were seized by the United States or Spain. Despite this interference, and having only originally started with {{a small number of}} weapons, the mambises were able to build up a significant arsenal by conducting raids on the Spanish troops and strongholds.|$|R

5|$|BuddyTV also ranked Sheriff Lamb's death 7th on {{its list}} of the seven saddest TV deaths of 2007. On a ranking of all 64 Veronica Mars episodes, Anais Bordages of BuzzFeed ranked the episode 13th. After the series was {{announced}} as being cancelled by The CW, fans collectively sent nearly 10,000 Mars bars to Dawn Ostroff, {{the president of the}} network as a reference to the show, but the <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> futile.|$|E
5|$|Firewatch {{runs on the}} Unity game engine. Ng {{disapproved of}} the tools for {{creating}} trees, and therefore hand-modeled the 23 kinds of trees that would be placed within the game 4,600 times. A custom shader was also employed to produce more stylized and simplified foliage. The in-game fire lookout towers were built in accordance with government specifications, utilizing standard lumber size, after Ng's first <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> unsatisfactory.|$|E
5|$|Fossett tried {{six times}} {{over seven years}} for the first solo balloon circumnavigation. His fifth attempt cost him $1.25 {{million of his own}} money; his sixth and {{successful}} <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> commercially sponsored. Two of the attempts were launched from Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri. Washington University in St. Louis served as control center for four of the six flights, including the record-breaking one.|$|E

25|$|Various <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> made to mate the 40mm Bofors L/50 {{gun to the}} M3 chassis. In {{most cases}} the weapon's recoil was too severe or the {{mounting}} too heavy, and the <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> finally stopped with {{the adoption of the}} M19 MGMC on the M24 light tank chassis.|$|R
50|$|From 1905 to 1910, {{most of the}} movement’s {{activities}} were closed off to the elite class or rare scholar.
