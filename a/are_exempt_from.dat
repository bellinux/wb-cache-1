5|$|In the United States, common {{starlings}} <b>are</b> <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, {{which prohibits}} the taking or killing of migratory birds. No permit {{is required to}} remove nests and eggs or kill juveniles or adults. Research was undertaken in 1966 to identify a suitable avicide that would both kill common starlings and would readily be eaten by them. It also needed to be of low toxicity to mammals and not likely to cause the death of pets that ate dead birds. The chemical that best fitted these criteria was DRC-1339, now marketed as Starlicide. In 2008, the United States government poisoned, shot or trapped 1.7million birds, {{the largest number of}} any nuisance species to be destroyed. In 2005, the population in the United States was estimated at 140million birds, around 45% of the global total of 310million.|$|E
