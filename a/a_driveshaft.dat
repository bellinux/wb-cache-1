5|$|The BT49's racing career {{got off to}} an {{unsettled}} {{start when}} Brabham's lead driver, Niki Lauda, abruptly quit the sport after 10 laps of the first practice session at the penultimate race of the 1979 season, the Canadian Grand Prix. The car soon showed promise: Piquet ran third in the race on the high speed Circuit Île Notre-Dame before retiring with a broken gearbox. Lauda's replacement, Argentine novice Ricardo Zunino, was seventh of the nine who completed the race. At the season finale in wet conditions at the Watkins Glen International circuit, Zunino spun off although Piquet set the fastest lap before <b>a</b> <b>driveshaft</b> failed, putting his {{car out of the}} race.|$|E
25|$|The US {{intended}} to ferry captured aircraft {{back to the}} US aboard a ship, but only had room {{for one of the}} captured Drachen. The RAF objected to plans to destroy the other, the V14, so Gerstenhauer, with two observers, flew it across the English Channel from Cherbourg to RAF Beaulieu on 6 September 1945, the first crossing of the Channel by a helicopter. The V14 later made two test flights at RAF Beaulieu before being destroyed on 3 October, when <b>a</b> <b>driveshaft</b> failed. The accident was thought to be due to a failure to correctly tension the steel cables which secured the engine, despite warnings from Gerstenhauer.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, {{the victory}} in Belgium {{was the high}} point for AAR as engine {{problems}} continued to plague the Eagle. Despite the antiquated engine tooling used by the Weslake factory (dating from World War I), failures rarely stemmed from the engine design itself, but more often from unreliable peripheral systems like fuel pumps, fuel injection and the oil delivery system. He led the 1967 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring when <b>a</b> <b>driveshaft</b> failed two laps from the end with a 42-second lead in hand. After a third-place finish in Canada that year, the car would finish only one more race. By {{the end of the}} 1968 season, Gurney was driving a McLaren-Ford. His last Formula One race was the 1970 British Grand Prix.|$|E

25|$|The army's first {{lineage of}} tanks had {{evolved from the}} M1 Combat Car and progressed to the M2 Light Tank, M2 Medium Tank, M3 Lee, and finally the M4 Sherman; these tanks all shared the common traits of using {{rear-mounted}} Continental air-cooled radial aircraft engines and a front sprocket drive. The rear engine-front sprocket drive layout required <b>a</b> <b>driveshaft</b> to pass underneath the turret, which increased the overall height of the tank, a characteristic shared with German tanks of World War II that also used this layout. In addition, the large diameter of the radial engines in the M4 line of tanks added further to the hull height. These mechanical features accounted for the high silhouette and large side sponsons that were characteristic of the M4 lineage.|$|E
25|$|Lynn's race ended {{early on}} lap 25 {{when he stopped}} on track with <b>a</b> <b>driveshaft</b> failure. Di Grassi was {{separated}} by the two Mahindra cars of Rosenqvist and Heidfeld, and battled the former while also defending from the latter. Dillmann and Gasly overtook Carroll {{to move into the}} points-scoring positions on lap 29. As the lead group established themselves, attention focused on di Grassi's duel with Rosenqvist. Di Grassi was cautious as he attempted to find room to pass Rosenqvist, but kept pressuring him. On lap 33, Rosenqvist locked his tires turning into the turn two chicane, causing him to lose control of his car's rear-end, and drifted into the corner's exit barrier. His error promoted di Grassi into fifth place; the impact removed his rear wing, prompting race officials to display a black flag with an orange circle, requiring him to make a pit stop for repairs. After passing Dillmann, Gasly was at this point running in seventh position. Heidfeld's right-rear suspension collapsed after hitting the turn three inside kerb too hard on the 37th lap. He stopped on track, triggering the safety car's deployment, and reducing the time gaps within the field. Heidfeld pushed his car back to pit lane without assistance from marshals.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the quiet 2009 season, 2010 saw Hughes entering several different series. His season started with a retirement at the 8 Hours of Castellet, part of the LMS, driving for Quifel-ASM in a Ginetta-Zytek GZ09S/2 alongside Amaral and Olivier Pla. The next three races Hughes contested were {{all part of the}} FIA GT1 World Championship, driving Sumo Power GT's Nissan GT-R with Jamie Campbell-Walter, with the best result of those races being a victory at the RAC Tourist Trophy, held at Silverstone. Following these three events, he returned to the Quifel-ASM team for the 24 Hours of Le Mans, alongside Amaral and Pla. For the first time since his victory in 2005, Hughes was able to finish the race, taking seventh in class and 20th overall, although the race was by no means trouble free, due to an accident and <b>a</b> <b>driveshaft</b> failure. Following this event, Hughes returned to the GT1 championship with Sumo Power GT, at the Paul Ricard round, finishing eighth. He then returned to the LMS for the 1000 km of Algarve, this time driving a DAMS-entered Oreca FLM 09 alongside Firth, and finishing sixth overall, taking the Formula Le Mans class win. His next four events were split across the LMS and the GT1 series, with both GT1 entries being for Sumo Power GT, whilst he entered one event for RLR msport (in their MG EX265) and one for DAMS, with his best overall finish out of the four races coming at the Nürburgring round, where he and Campbell-Walter finished eighth, whilst his final LMS race of the season, the 1000 km of Silverstone, saw a 14th place overall, with a class win for Hughes and Firth. Following that race, he competed in the five remaining GT1 rounds for Sumo Power GT, with third at the Navarra round proving to be his best result out of those races. At the end of the season, Hughes and Campbell-Walter were classified 12th in the GT1 championship, whilst Hughes was also classified 12th in the FLM category of the LMS.|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "lift" [...] mode for {{assisted}} vertical maneuvers, 29,000hp is diverted forward through <b>a</b> <b>driveshaft</b> {{from the}} engine's low-pressure (LP) turbine via a clutch and bevel-gearbox to a vertically mounted, contra-rotating lift fan located {{forward of the}} main engine. The fan efflux (low-velocity unheated air) discharges through a thrust vectoring nozzle {{on the underside of}} the aircraft, thus balancing the aft lift generated by the 3BSM. For lateral stability and roll control, bypass air from the engine goes out through a roll-post nozzle in each wing. For pitch control, the areas of exhaust nozzle and LiftFan inlet are varied conversely to change the balance between them while maintaining their sum, and with constant turbine speed. Yaw control is achieved by yawing the 3BSM. Forward, and even backward, motion is controlled by tilting the 3BSM and LiftFan outlet.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, Speed again ran his own {{operation}} starting 27 of the 31 races on the schedule. [...] Lake {{was unable}} {{to qualify for the}} 1981 Daytona 500, but did manage to win the 30-lap consolation race, leading the race from start to finish. He scored a ninth-place finish in both races at Rockingham and at Bristol. He followed that up with a seventh in Martinsville Speedway's spring event, an eighth at the now-defunct Texas World Speedway and a sixth in the late summer Talladega event. Speed's final top ten would come at Bristol in August where he finished seventh. The final points tally came up with Speed finishing 18th in points.

2500|$|While {{competing}} in Formula One, Gurney also raced {{each year in}} the Indianapolis 500 from 1962 to 1970. Gurney made his Indy début at the wheel of a space-frame rear engined car designed by John Crosthwaite and built by American hot-rodder Mickey Thompson Despite a misfiring engine, Gurney ran comfortably in the top 10 until a transmission seal failed on the 92nd lap. The last 3 years, he finished 2nd, 2nd, and 3rd, respectively. [...] In 1969, he did not race in Formula One, instead racing in the USAC Championship Car series and also in CanAm. [...] He started a total of 28 Champ Car races, winning 7 times among his 18 top tens.

2500|$|Räikkönen then {{achieved}} {{three consecutive}} poles in San Marino, Spain, and a win after a safety car strategy call by Neil Martin at Monaco. An almost certain win was denied at Imola after <b>a</b> <b>driveshaft</b> failure, but {{he won the}} other two races, putting him within 22 points of leader Alonso. He registered strong, comfortable wins at Barcelona, beating Alonso, and at Monte Carlo, never dropping his lead in both races. At the , Räikkönen flat-spotted his right front tyre while lapping Jacques Villeneuve. The resultant vibrations caused his suspension to fail while he led on the final lap, sending him into the tyre wall and handing a further ten points to his rival Alonso. Changing a tyre would have given him a relatively safe third place. However, tyre changes were only allowed in 2005 in cases where a [...] "punctured or damaged tyre" [...] could be changed for [...] "clear and genuine safety reasons" [...] {{and there was no}} precedent for whether the stewards would consider a flat-spotted tyre dangerous enough.

2500|$|The 2005 {{model year}} {{continued}} with standard hood scoops, split rear exhaust with a revised rear fascia, and {{late in the}} year, optional 18inch (45.7cm) wheels. The major change for 2005 was {{the replacement of the}} LS1 engine with the LS2 engine. This [...] engine increased power and torque in the GTO to [...] with [...] torque. Other changes included larger front rotors and caliper hardware from the Corvette, and the drivetrain was strengthened with the addition of <b>a</b> <b>driveshaft</b> with larger [...] "giubos" [...] and a larger differential flange, as well as revised half-shafts. Dashboard gauge graphics were revised. The optional dealer-installed Sport Appearance Package became available and differed visually by having a different lower rear fascia, aftermarket mufflers with quad chrome exhaust tips, revised spoiler and front lower fascia extension, recessed grilles, and revised rocker panels. This package was available from GM as an accessory in red, silver, black, or primer for other color cars. Production was 11,069 due in part to a shortened model year. Barbados Blue and Cosmos Purple were dropped this year, but Cyclone Grey and Midnight Blue Metallic were added.

In one major difference from the earlier V-22 Osprey tiltrotor, the engines remain in place while the rotors and drive shafts tilt. <b>A</b> <b>driveshaft</b> runs through the straight wing, allowing both prop rotors to be driven by a single engine in the event of engine loss. The V-280 will have retractable landing gear, a triple-redundant fly by wire control system, and a V-tail configuration. The wings are made of a single section of Carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite, reducing weight and production costs. The V-280 will have a crew of 4 and be capable of transporting up to 14 troops. Dual cargo hooks will give it a lift capacity to carry a [...] M777A2 Howitzer while flying at a speed of [...] The fuselage is visually {{similar to that of the}} UH-60 Black Hawk medium lift helicopter. When landed, the wing is in excess of seven feet from the ground, allowing soldiers to egress easily out of two [...] wide side doors and door gunners to have wide fields of fire. Although the initial design is a utility configuration, Bell is also working on an attack configuration. Whether different variants of the V-280 would fill utility and attack roles or a single airframe could interchange payloads for either mission, Bell is confident the Valor tiltrotor platform can fulfill both duties; the U.S. Marine Corps is interested in having one aircraft to replace utility and attack helicopters, but the Army, which leads the program, is not committed to the idea and wants distinct platforms for each mission. [...] Bell and Lockheed claim an AV-280 variant can launch rockets, missiles, and even small unmanned aerial vehicles forward or aft with no rotor interference, even in forward flight and cruise modes with the rotors forward.|$|E
50|$|Advantages to the inboard engine with <b>a</b> long <b>driveshaft</b> include {{keeping the}} engine {{relatively}} dry.

2500|$|The 60hp Schneider {{gasoline}} engine and its radiator {{are located in}} the front part of the tank, to the immediate left of the driver. The four cylinder, 135×170 9753 cc, engine is of a type specially constructed for the Schneider CA. It attains its maximum output of sixty horsepower at a thousand rpm. The three forward speeds gearbox, as well as the differentials, which can be engaged by brakes on the half shafts to steer the tank, are all located on the rear axle. They are linked to the engine in the front by <b>a</b> <b>driveshaft</b> and a primary clutch. A secondary clutch is coupled to each sprocket and can be decoupled for a tight turn. The main clutch and the main brakes can be engaged by pedals, the throttle by a handle. By means of a reverse device the three gears can also be applied to drive backwards. Steering was generally very tiring and there was a tendency to jump out of gear when the clutch was engaged too forcefully. The tank's official top speed is only 8.1km/h. Practical terrain speed was even lower at two to four km/h. The first gear at 1000 rpm equals a speed of 2km/h, the second of 3.95km/h, the third of 6.75km/h. At two kilometres per hour the vehicle can climb a slope of 55%. The capacity to overcome obstacles, limited to a parapet of about eighty centimetres, is improved by two short climbing tails, fitted to the left and right of the lower hull rear. The lower profile of the tails is curved, allowing the vehicle to gradually raise itself above a trench floor, until its centre of gravity shifts over the edge causing its hull to suddenly tumble forward. [...] The trench-crossing capacity is about 175 centimetres. The wading capacity is eighty centimetres. Two fuel gravity-feed reservoirs placed above the engine below the right front roof and nose plate, have a total capacity of 145 litres, and allow for a practical range of about fifty kilometres, though the official range is eighty kilometres. The suspension consists of seven double road wheels attached to two bogies, the one in front carrying three, the other four. The rear bogie is sprung by two vertical coil springs, the front one larger than the rear one. [...] The front bogies of the left and the right, each sprung by a vertical coil of narrow diameter, are connected to each other by means of a yoke-like transverse beam, itself attached to the hull bottom by two wide vertical coils springs, diminishing rolling and tilt when crossing rough terrain. Ground clearance is forty-one centimetres. There are five small return rollers. The six-spoked idler is attached to the front bogie and can thus move vertically to some degree. The sprocket, having twenty teeth, is however fixed in relation to the hull. It has a somewhat larger diameter than the idler, causing the upper track profile to slope slightly downwards to the front. The track consists of thirty-three flat links with a width of thirty-six centimetres. The ground pressure is about 0.75kg/cm².|$|E
