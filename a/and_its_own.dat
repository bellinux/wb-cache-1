5|$|Finland {{had been}} {{the eastern part of}} the Swedish kingdom for centuries until 1809, during the Napoleonic Wars, when Imperial Russia conquered and {{converted}} it into an autonomous buffer state within the Russian Empire to protect Saint Petersburg, the imperial capital. Finland enjoyed wide autonomy <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> Senate until the turn of the century, when Russia began attempts to assimilate Finland as part of a general policy to strengthen central government and unify the Empire by Russification. These attempts ruined relations and increased the support of Finnish movements vying for self-government.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the {{governor}} of the Indiana Territory governed the Louisiana District (which included St. Louis), and the district's organizational law forbade the foreign slave trade and reduced the influence of St. Louis in the region. Wealthy St. Louisans petitioned Congress to review the system, and in July 1805, Congress reorganized the Louisiana District as the Louisiana Territory, with its territorial capital at St. Louis <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> territorial governor. From the division of the Louisiana Territory in 1812 to Missouri statehood in 1821, St. Louis was the capital of the Missouri Territory.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, 1997, the EPB {{published}} {{a series of}} quotes attributed to Pedro Albizu Campos discussing a variety of topics, from the Autonomic Charter of 1897 granting Puerto Rico membership in the International Postal Union <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> currency to the suplantation of historic figures and events in public schools. Most of the article focuses on Albizu's belief that Puerto Rico was in a de facto path towards independence when invades in 1898, the need for armed revolution and his assessment that statehood would only be possible with an anglosaxon culture.|$|E
5|$|The International Labour Organisation {{was created}} in 1919 {{on the basis of}} Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles. The ILO, {{although}} having the same members as the League and being subject to the budget control of the Assembly, was an autonomous organisation with its own Governing Body, its own General Conference <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> Secretariat. Its constitution differed from that of the League: representation had been accorded not only to governments but also to representatives of employers' and workers' organisations. Albert Thomas was its first director.|$|E

The 1992 release of The Primal Order, a supplement designed for use with any game system, brought legal trouble with Palladium Books suing for references to Palladium's game and system.

5|$|Another large {{building}} lies crosswise at {{the south}} end of the east range. Its lower level consists of a vaulted hall equipped with a grand thirteenth century hooded fireplace <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> garderobe. It is not clear what this chamber was used for, but it may have been the monastic infirmary—if so, it was a most unusual, perhaps unique, arrangement. Normally in a medieval Cistercian monastery an infirmary with its own kitchens, chapel and ancillary buildings would have been located east of the main buildings around a second, smaller cloister, but at Netley these seem to be absent. So far, excavations have not revealed whether Netley had a separate infirmary complex.|$|E
5|$|Before development, Hamersley was {{a remote}} {{district}} covered in jarrah, marri, banksia and other vegetation {{typical of the}} Swan Coastal Plain, with small areas cleared for small-scale agriculture such as market gardening and poultry farming. By 1974, six {{years after the first}} subdivision, Hamersley was home to the district's first community hall, an annual parade and fair which were broadcast on Perth TV and radio, an active progress association, <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> newspaper, the Hamersley Gazette, a forerunner to today's Stirling Times. Rapid growth further north removed the focus from Hamersley, which was completed in 1981 and has remained relatively stable since then.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Lumumba {{hoped that}} the United Nations (UN), which sent a multi-national {{peacekeeping}} force to the Congo in July 1960, would help the central government to suppress both Katangese and South Kasaian secessions. The UN was reluctant to do so, however, considering the secessions to be internal political matters <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> mission to be maintaining basic law and order. Rejected by both the UN and United States, Lumumba sought military support from the communist Soviet Union. Within days of the secession and with Soviet logistical support, 2,000 ANC troops launched a major offensive against South Kasai. The attack was extremely successful. On 27 August, ANC soldiers arrived in Bakwanga.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} {{is generated by}} electrical currents in the planet's outer core, which is composed of liquid metallic hydrogen. Volcanic eruptions on Jupiter's moon Io eject large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas into space, forming a large torus around the planet. Jupiter's magnetic field forces the torus to rotate with the same angular velocity and direction as the planet. The torus in turn loads the magnetic field with plasma, in the process stretching it into a pancake-like structure called a magnetodisk. In effect, Jupiter's magnetosphere is shaped by Io's plasma <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> rotation, {{rather than by the}} solar wind like Earth's magnetosphere. Strong currents in the magnetosphere generate permanent aurorae around the planet's poles and intense variable radio emissions, which means that Jupiter {{can be thought of as}} a very weak radio pulsar. Jupiter's aurorae have been observed in almost all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including infrared, visible, ultraviolet and soft X-rays.|$|E
5|$|Progress on {{the section}} from Paddington to Queen's Park was slowed by {{the start of}} World War I, so the line was not {{finished}} until early 1915. As at Paddington, the three below-ground stations were built to use escalators. Maida Vale and Kilburn Park were provided with buildings {{in the style of the}} earlier Leslie Green stations but without the upper storey, which was no longer required for housing lift gear. Warwick Avenue was accessed from a subway under the street. The LNWR rebuilt Queen's Park station with additional platforms for the Bakerloo Tube's <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> electric services and constructed two train sheds for rolling stock, one each side of the station.|$|E
5|$|Rowell was {{promoted}} to colonel on 13 October 1939, and when the government decided to form I Corps in April 1940, Blamey was given the command and Rowell became brigadier, general staff (BGS), with the rank of brigadier. Blamey and Rowell prepared I Corps for operations as best they could, completing the force's structure and integrating new units as they arrived in the Middle East. Rowell strove to establish {{good relations with the}} British Army, while occasionally having to remind them that the AIF was answerable to its own commander in chief <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> government. Rowell's efforts to create an administrative headquarters to free the I Corps staff for operational duties foundered on Blamey's reluctance to delegate authority. The best that he could achieve was the creation of a Base and Line of Communications Units command under Brigadier Allan Boase but I Corps remained responsible for organisation and training.|$|E

5|$|The 13 {{states are}} based on {{historical}} Malay kingdoms, and 9 of the 11 Peninsular states, known as the Malay states, retain their royal families. The King is elected by and from the nine rulers to serve a five-year term. This King appoints governors serving a four-year term for the states without monarchies, after consultations with the chief minister of that state. Each state has a unicameral legislature known as the State Legislative Assembly, <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> written constitution. Sabah and Sarawak have considerably more autonomy than the other states, most notably having separate immigration policies and controls, and a unique residency status. Federal intervention in state affairs, lack of development, and disputes over oil royalties have occasionally led to statements about secession from leaders in several states such as Johor, Kelantan, Sabah and Sarawak, although these have not been followed up and no serious independence movements exist.|$|E
5|$|With even a {{few hundred}} missiles, the Soviets could afford to target every US bomber base. With no warning system in place, a sneak attack could destroy a {{significant}} amount of the US bomber fleet on the ground. The US would still have the airborne alert force <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> small ICBM fleet, but the USSR would have its entire bomber fleet and any missiles they did not launch, leaving them with a massive strategic advantage. To ensure this could not happen, the Report called for the installation of active defenses at SAC bases, Hercules in the short term and an ABM for the 1959 period, along with new early warning radars for ballistic missiles to allow alert aircraft to get away before the missiles hit. Even Zeus would come too late to cover this period, and some consideration was given to an adapted Hercules or a land based version of the Navy's RIM-8 Talos as an interim ABM.|$|E
5|$|Establishing a {{partnership}} with Robert Stirling Newall in 1850, Bell set up the first factory {{in the world with}} machines able to manufacture steel rope and submarine cable. Two years later his brothers Thomas Bell and John Bell joined him to build a major iron works at Port Clarence, Middlesbrough on the north bank of the River Tees. By 1853 there were three blast furnaces, each with a capacity of just over 6000 cubic feet, making them the largest in Britain at the time. The works produced iron for bridges and steel rails for railways across the British Empire including the North Eastern Railway company, of which Bell was a director from 1864 onwards, and deputy chairman from 1895 until his death. The Bell brothers' company operated its own ironstone mines at Normanby and Cleveland, <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> limestone quarries in Weardale, employing about 6000 men in mining and manufacturing. By 1878 the firm was producing 200,000 tons of iron per annum. Bell was a professional metallurgist and industrial chemist, constantly pioneering processes such as the recycling of heat from escaping flue gases, and trialling many process improvements.|$|E
