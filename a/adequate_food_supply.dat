5|$|Grasshoppers eat large {{quantities}} of foliage both as adults and during their development, and can be serious pests of arid land and prairies. Pasture, grain, forage, vegetable and other crops can be affected. Grasshoppers often bask in the sun, and thrive in warm sunny conditions, so drought stimulates an increase in grasshopper populations. A single season of drought is not normally sufficient to stimulate a massive population increase, but several successive dry seasons can do so, especially if the intervening winters are mild so {{that large numbers of}} nymphs survive. Although sunny weather stimulates growth, there needs to be an <b>adequate</b> <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> for the increasing grasshopper population. This means that although precipitation is needed to stimulate plant growth, prolonged periods of cloudy weather will slow nymphal development.|$|E

25|$|The basic social unit of {{the tiger}} is the {{elemental}} one of mother and offspring. Adult animals congregate only on an ad hoc and transitory basis when special conditions permit, such as plentiful supply of food. Otherwise they lead solitary lives, hunting individually for the dispersed forest and tall grassland animals, upon which they prey. They establish and maintain home ranges. Resident adults of either sex tend to confine their movements to a definite area of habitat within which they satisfy their needs, {{and in the case}} of tigresses, those of their growing cubs. Besides providing the requirements of an <b>adequate</b> <b>food</b> <b>supply,</b> sufficient water and shelter, and a modicum of peace and seclusion, this location must make it possible for the resident to maintain contact with other tigers, especially those of the opposite sex. Those sharing the same ground are well aware of each other's movements and activities.|$|E

50|$|Climate {{also affects}} {{the supply of}} fuel for cooking; a common Chinese food {{preparation}} method was cutting food into small pieces to cook foods quickly and conserve scarce firewood and charcoal.

50|$|The {{problem has}} deep {{historical}} roots, probably {{dating back to}} the origins of life on Earth 3.8 billion years ago. In the early stone age, improved hunting techniques in vulnerable areas caused the extinction of many prey species, leaving the enlarged populace without an <b>adequate</b> <b>food</b> <b>supply.</b> The only apparent alternative, agriculture, also proved to be a progress trap. Salination, deforestation, erosion and urban sprawl led to disease, malnutrition and so forth, hence shorter lives.|$|E

[...] After the project was completed, Chang'an again had <b>adequate</b> <b>food</b> <b>supplies,</b> allowing the region to begin to recover.Pugu, meanwhile, had allied with Huige and Tibet, and in late 764 and then again in 765 allied with them to attack the Chang'an region.

A low-level Northern Wei officer who {{had been charged with}} crime then fled to the Xia camp and revealed the lack of <b>food</b> and water <b>supplies</b> that Daxi's forces were having. Helian Ding then attacked and captured Daxi. Upon hearing this, the Northern Wei general Qiudun Dui (丘敦堆), who was defending Anding, panicked and fled to Chang'an, and then further fled Chang'an with Chang'an's commanding general Tuoba Li (拓拔禮) to Puban (蒲阪, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), allowing Xia forces to recover Chang'an and the surrounding Guanzhong region.|$|R

In short, food scarcity is a growing concern that, according to many researchers, is projected to worsen with climate change because of a number of factors including extreme weather events and an increase in pests and pathogens.|$|E

40|$|Future {{directions}} of <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> and demand {{will be determined}} by the interaction of various market forces (such as prices, population, and income) as they will be affected by decisions and policies of farmers, national governments, and international donors. Considering all these factors, an IFPRI global food model was used to estimate future world prices, supply, demand, and trade of cereals. Results for three scenarios are presented in this brief: a baseline scenario, a scenario where production growth will slow, and a scenario in which, in conjunction with the production growth reduction, income growth will also slow. The model is also capable of simulating other scenarios. The results clearly indicate that it is critical to maintain yield growth rates in developing economies, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Because lower production is associated with income losses, it would be disastrous in developing regions. Higher prices would also have a profound impact on effective demand and the ability of the world's poor, the bottom 20 percent of the world's population, to obtain <b>adequate</b> <b>food</b> <b>supplies.</b> BriefNon-PRIFPRI 1; 2020 DG...|$|R
50|$|Deprived {{of much of}} his power, Indutiomarus became all {{the more}} bitter {{an enemy of the}} Romans, and waited for a {{favourable}} opportunity to take his revenge. Such an opportunity arrived soon. To ensure <b>adequate</b> <b>food</b> <b>supplies,</b> Caesar had separated his troops into winter quarters dispersed in different parts of Gaul. Indutiomarus encouraged Ambiorix and Cativolcus, chiefs of the Eburones, to attack the Roman legion stationed in their country; he himself soon afterwards marched against Titus Labienus, who was encamped among the Remi, immediately west of the Treveri. Forewarned of Caesar's victory over the Nervii, Indutiomarus withdrew his forces into Treveran country and raised fresh troops. He also spent the winter sending ambassadors to the Germans in search of allies. Other peoples began sending ambassadors to Indutiomarus of their own accord as well - these included the Senones, the Carnutes, the Nervii and the Aduatuci.|$|R
