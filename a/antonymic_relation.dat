Few turns of phrase have become as easily convertible, turning the “special property” (of the definition of a Greek idioma) through collocation into an implicit signified conventionalized by common usage. In the phrases turning on the elements “the exception” and “the rule,” the antonyms are being assimilated to each other, neutralizing their oppositional relation—not as a matter of a mystical “attraction of opposites,” nor even as a matter of a special type of Schmittian complexio oppositorum, but rather, in Michael Marder’s terms, 2 as a matter of a “metonymic abuse of modernity. ” Without examining the <b>antonymic</b> <b>relation</b> between the terms, their specific figural emergence tends to be relegated to oblivion. This process of conventionalization is transported into the philosophical discourse in which these terms acquire further attributions. The semantic fields of “the exception” and “the rule” have provided fertile ground for such transpositions—prime examples being the phrases “the exception proves the rule” and “the exception has become the rule. ”www. telospress. comam 2016 Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the system of {{adjectives}} which denote the portrait characteristics of {{a person in the}} Modern Ukrainian Language. The semantic specific features of synonymic and <b>antonymic</b> <b>relations</b> of the adjectives which form a macrofield «Portrait Characteristics of a Person» have been analyzed. The microfield «Vertical Size» has been singled out in this macrofield. Lexical and semantic groups have been defined on the basis of integral and differential denotative and significant semes. Structural organization of lexical and semantic groups has been clarified as a result of semes analysis. The subject of the research concerns semantic and functional peculiarities of systematic relations of the Ukrainian adjectives which denote the portrait characteristics as constituents of a lexical and semantic field...|$|R
40|$|This {{work will}} use {{selected}} examples {{for the analysis}} of technical terms and their lexicographic treatment in general Croatian monolingual dictionaries: what are the criteria and in what scope are technical terms chosen for general dictionaries, where is the dividing line between general lexis and the language for specific purposes, as well as when can, and when must terminological references be noted? To what extent are the dictionaries mutually uniform, and to what extent are the terms of specific fields treated systematically? Furthermore, this work will deal with the question of how lexical-semantic relations between terms are developed in the dictionaries; this refers primarily to hypernym-hyponym <b>relations,</b> <b>antonymic</b> <b>relations</b> and the criteria according to which one of the synonyms is given advantage over others. The work will analyze terms in the contemporary Croatian dictionaries...|$|R

Purpose of the article is to analyze synonymic and <b>antonymic</b> <b>relations</b> in the system of Ukrainian football terminology. The source base is the professional dictionaries, general language dictionaries, sports newspapers and magazines, professional, non-fiction and reference books on football issues, football programmes on TV, broadcasting of football matches, football Internetcommunication, oral football communication. In analyzed case of terms founded such types of synonyms: one-word terms-doublets, termssyntactic synonyms, definitional synonyms, stylistic synonyms. Absolute synonyms coincide with semantics, emotional colouring, compatibility, not frequency. Partial synonyms are dominated. It is found that antonymic synonyms in the football vocabulary convey the spirit of resistance in this sport. It is determined semantic opposition based on different types of relationships: a) semantic relations (gradual, complementary, vector, coordinate antonyms); b) formal and structural terms (with different and with same root); c) stylistic terms (general language and contextual antonyms). Summing up, football terminology needs constant attention of researchers, especially in its unification and standardization...|$|R
40|$|Little {{research}} has been done on <b>antonymic</b> <b>relations,</b> a great deal of this has been done by linguists Paradis et al. Gamification was used in natural language acquisition by Bos and Nissim in their 2015 study about noun-noun compound relations, but gamification of information retrieval remains a relatively new field of study. This thesis reproduced work done by Paradis et al. in an attempt to answer the following questions for Swedish antonyms: will reversing word order in <b>antonymic</b> <b>relations</b> affect the strength of said word pair? Will the perceived strength of canonical antonyms have a lower variance than that of non-canonical antonyms? It will also examine whether giving points depending on the agreement with other users reduce the occurrence of extreme points on an ordinal scale? Two parallel studies were conducted, one using a web app which implemented consensus driven rewards, and another utilising a questionnaire. Reversing the order of the words did not to alter the perceived strength of the antonymic pair, which is consistent with the results acquired by Paradis et al. in 2009. Results regarding variance of canonical and non-canonical antonym pairs were inconclusive. An implementation with consensus driven rewards yielded more extreme values than the questionnaire. More research is suggested to improve the strength of the results. Lite forskning har gjorts om antonymer inom natural language acquisition, och mycket av den forskning som finns om antonymer är gjord av Paradis et al. inom lingvistik. Gamifiering har använts inom natural language acquisition, bland annat av Bos och Nissim i deras studie om relationer hos sammansatta substantiv från 2015. Denna rapport försöker besvara följande frågor om svenska antonymer: spelar ordningen på ord i ett antonympar någon roll i hur parets antonymiska styrka uppfattas? Kommer den uppfattade styrkan hos kanoniska antonympar ha lägre varians än deras ickekanoniska motsvarigheter? Rapporten undersöker även huruvida konsensusdriven poängsättning påverkar förekomsten av extremvärden på en ordinalskala. Två parallella delstudier utfördes, en webapp som implementerade konsensusdriven poängsättning, samt ett frågeformulär utan poängsättning. Ordningen av orden i ett antonympar hade ingen signifikant påverkan på dess uppfattade styrka, i enighet med Paradis et al. s studie från 2009. Resultaten angående kanoniska antonymers varians var inte entydiga. Implementationen med konsensusbaserad poängsättning gav fler extremvärden än frågeformuläret. Eftersom detta var en liten studie behövs vidare undersökning för att stärka resultaten...|$|R

Such a state of affairs contradicts Kittay and Lehrer 2 ̆ 7 s claim that <b>antonymic</b> <b>relations</b> are preserved under metaphorical extension. The existence of sentences like 2 ̆ 7 On je bistar ali mutan 2 ̆ 7 2 ̆ 7 He has a quick intelligence but he is a fishy man 2 ̆ 7 presents the most persuasive argument that 2 ̆ 7 mutan 2 ̆ 7 describing humans is not the antonymous counterpart of 2 ̆ 7 bistar 2 ̆ 7. The question arises as to why 2 ̆ 7 mutan 2 ̆ 7 did not shift to the mental dimension, like 2 ̆ 7 bistar 2 ̆ 7, but took on a moral meaning? According to the author, in seeking to find the answer one should consider both the semantic relation existing between 2 ̆ 7 mutan 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 prljav 2 ̆ 7 2 ̆ 7 dirty 2 ̆ 7 and the fact that 2 ̆ 7 mutan 2 ̆ 7 functions as antonym not only to 2 ̆ 7 bistar 2 ̆ 7 but also to 2 ̆ 7 jasan 2 ̆ 7 2 ̆ 7 clear 2 ̆ 7. Both circumstances have determined the semantic development of 2 ̆ 7 mutan 2 ̆ 7...|$|R
