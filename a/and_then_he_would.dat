25|$|From around 1849 Darwin stopped {{attending}} church, but Emma and {{the children}} continued to attend services.

During the service, Emma continued to face forward when the congregation turned to face the altar for the Creed, sticking to her Unitarian faith.|$|E

25|$|The {{event that}} finally took {{him off the}} road came in Houston in 1993. He had made a large score playing high-stakes pool one night. The {{following}} morning while attempting to leave his hotel room with his then girlfriend, two men shoved the two {{back into the room}} and at gunpoint demanded the money he had won. Not satisfied with the amount of money Wetch handed over, they placed a bag over his head and beat him. Though he escaped the ordeal with only minor injuries, he promised himself he would only make one more road trip to gather a stake, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> quit. He made that final trip and used the money to open up a pool room with partner David Wagner, Jimmy's Pro Billiards in Columbia Heights, Minnesota. The following year, in 1994, he took the ultimate step for a road player, shucking aside his anonymity by going pro.|$|E

500|$|For a time, however, {{it seems}} that Finley & Figg will not need to bother about all that, but {{would be able to}} have a big payday while riding on another firm's coattails. There are several other lawyers all over the U.S. who have filed Krayoxx tort suits. The blossoming class action lawsuit against Varrick Labs is coordinated by Jerry Alisandros of Florida, who has become rich out of {{previous}} lawsuits against Varrick. Wally flies to Las Vegas to meet the other mass tort interests. Alisandros offers Wally [...] "a ride" [...] back to Chicago in his luxurious private jet and makes clear that all Wally needs to do is locate some more Krayoxx cases in Chicago <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> become part of a mass settlement, with Alisandros taking care of all the rest, such as finding experts to testify on the harmful effects of Krayoxx.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Tim Minear and [...] Vince Gilligan, and {{directed}} by Daniel Sackheim. Minear's original idea for the episode involved a convicted criminal {{who happened to be}} an atheist. While in prison, he would have heard the voice of God, commanding him to kill a truly evil man, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have suddenly found himself mystically transferred out of the prison. Although the police would be after him, only Mulder would believe he was working for the greater good. Minear noted that [...] "I pitched it and I was going to do it, eventually, until we found ourselves at a point in the year where we needed a script really fast." [...] Executive producer Frank Spotnitz suggested to Minear that the [...] "convicted atheist" [...] should actually be Robert Modell from the third season episode [...] "Pusher". After this was decided, Minear put aside the [...] "Word of God" [...] story, as it was called, teamed up with Gilligan, and the two wrote the final script.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first of}} the poems appears to confirm the stories of how he was an {{itinerant}} monk prior to stopping at Kuoching Temple (<b>and</b> even <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> depart at least once for a pilgrimage to Mount Wutai): ...|$|R
60|$|When {{therefore}} {{he left his}} home, the one fixed idea in Herbert Harmer's mind was, that first of all <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go to sea, <b>and</b> that <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> some day visit India; both which resolutions he carried into effect.|$|R
60|$|On his {{way back}} to his wife March met Miss Triscoe; he was not {{altogether}} surprised to meet Burnamy with her, now. The young fellow asked if he could be of any use to him, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> look him up in the train. He seemed in a hurry, but when he walked away with Miss Triscoe he did not seem in a hurry.|$|R
500|$|Kemper {{also had}} a dark fantasy life: he {{performed}} rites with his younger sister's dolls that culminated in him removing their heads and hands, and, on one occasion, when his elder sister, Susan Hughey Kemper (1943â€“2014), teased him and asked why he {{did not try to}} kiss his teacher, he replied: [...] "If I kiss her, I'd have to kill her first." [...] He also recalled that as a little boy, he would sneak out of his house and, armed with his father's bayonet, go to his second-grade teacher's house to watch her through the windows. Kemper stated in later interviews that as a child some of his favorite games to play were [...] "Gas Chamber" [...] and [...] "Electric Chair", in which he asked his younger sister to tie him up, flip an imaginary switch <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> tumble over and writhe on the floor, pretending to be dying of gas inhalation or electric shock. He also had two near-death experiences as a child, once when his elder sister tried to push him in front of a train, and another when she successfully pushed him into the deep end of a swimming pool, where he almost drowned.|$|E
500|$|Soon after, Moore and Black quit {{their old}} band, the Starlite Wranglers, {{to play with}} Presley regularly, and DJ and {{promoter}} Bob Neal became the trio's manager. From August through October, they played frequently at the Eagle's Nest club and returned to Sun Studio for more recording sessions, and Presley quickly grew more confident on stage. According to Moore, [...] "His movement was a natural thing, {{but he was also}} very conscious of what got a reaction. He'd do something one time <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> expand on it real quick." [...] Presley made what would be his only appearance on Nashville's Grand Ole Opry on October 2; after a polite audience response, Opry manager Jim Denny told Phillips that his singer was [...] "not bad" [...] but did not suit the program. Two weeks later, Presley was booked on Louisiana Hayride, the Oprys chief, and more adventurous, rival. The Shreveport-based show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states. Presley had another attack of nerves during the first set, which drew a muted reaction. A more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response. House drummer D. J. Fontana brought a new element, complementing Presley's movements with accented beats that he had mastered playing in strip clubs. Soon after the show, the Hayride engaged Presley for a year's worth of Saturday-night appearances. Trading in his old guitar for $8 (and seeing it promptly dispatched to the garbage), he purchased a Martin instrument for $175, and his trio began playing in new locales including Houston, Texas, and Texarkana, Arkansas.|$|E
500|$|Byzantine {{accounts}} of Thomas's rebellion state {{that he did}} not in fact claim the throne under his own name but assumed the identity of Emperor Constantine VI, who had been deposed and murdered by his mother, Irene of Athens, in 797. Most modern scholars follow Lemerle, who dismisses this as yet another later fabrication. If it contains any truth, it is possible that this story may originate from Thomas choosing to be crowned under the regnal name of [...] "Constantine", but there is no evidence for such an act. The possible appropriation of Constantine VI's identity is linked in some Byzantine sources with the statement that Thomas was a rumoured supporter of iconolatry, as opposed to Michael's support for iconoclasm: it was under Constantine VI that veneration of the icons was restored. Nevertheless, the ambiguous phrasing of the sources, the iconoclast leanings of many themes in Asia Minor, and Thomas's alliance with the Arabs seem to speak against any open commitment to icon worship on his part. Indeed, given Michael II's conciliatory approach during his early reign, the icon worship controversy {{does not seem to have}} been a major issue at the time, and in the view of modern scholars most probably did not play a major role in Thomas's revolt. The image of Thomas as an iconophile champion opposed to the iconoclast Michael II in later, Macedonian-era sources was probably the result of their own anti-iconoclast bias. Warren Treadgold furthermore suggests that if true, Thomas's claim to be Constantine VI may have been little more than a tale circulated to win support, and that Thomas pursued a [...] "studied ambiguity" [...] towards icons, designed to attract support from iconophiles. In Treadgold's words, [...] "Thomas could be all things to all men until he had conquered the whole empire, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have time enough to disappoint some of his followers".|$|E
60|$|Our {{friend said}} he could not go home in the state he was then; he felt sure he should kill the twins if he did. He pondered for awhile, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go and hear some music. He said he thought a little music would soothe and ennoble him--make him feel more like a Christian than he did at that precise moment.|$|R

2500|$|Bowles was {{appointed}} in 2010 to co-chair President Barack Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform with Alan K. Simpson.

Hardin said that the University was not interested in running a locomotive and if it was, it would be run by all university employees. He said that if the Railroad Club wanted to run the engine, it should form a 501c3 corporation <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> give the club the engine.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the late}} 1960s, McIntire's {{relationship}} with the ACCC leadership became strained, and he secretly transferred an ACCC relief agency (along with $62,000) to the ICCC, which remained firmly under his control. McIntire [...] "was perennially late to ACCC meetings, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> demand that any decisions made in advance of his arrival be undone." [...] When ACCC leaders refused to accommodate him, he attacked them in the Christian Beacon, claiming {{that there was a}} [...] "Baptist plot against him." [...] After being outmaneuvered, McIntire attempted a parliamentary takeover in October 1970, which eventually led to a court order against him in 1971, and a final severing of his {{relationship with the}} ACCC.|$|E
2500|$|Just before leaving, Batra {{along with}} the 25 men of his Delta Company, who were to {{accompany}} him, prayed at the Durga Mata temple. It was pitch black night when they began the climb. Having heard a wireless message from the base that Sher Shah (Batra's code name) was coming, a cheer went up among the tired Indian soldiers on top. The commander ordered them to hold their ground until Sher Shah arrived <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> take over. [...] "The Pakistanis too intercepted the wireless message where the base told the peak that Sher Shah was coming. They knew Batra, the first man on top of Peak 5140 in Drass, was Sher Shah and broke into the Indian wireless system to threaten him. Undeterred Batra kept climbing," [...] said a soldier who accompanied him.|$|E

2500|$|Having been {{stripped}} of his administrative office by the new BrÄƒtianu cabinet, Macedonski faced financial difficulties, {{and was forced to}} move into a house on the outskirts of Bucharest, and later moved between houses in northern Bucharest. According to CÄƒlinescu, the poet continued to cultivate luxury and passionately invested in the decorative arts, although his source of income, other than the supposed assistance [...] "of [...] ruling houses", remains a mystery. Arguing that Macedonski was [...] "always in need of money" [...] to use on his luxury items, poet Victor Eftimiu claimed: [...] "He did not shy away from sending emphatic notes to the potentates of his day , flattering some, threatening others. He would marry off or simply mate some of his disciples with aging and rich women, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> squeeze out their assets." ...|$|E

She played the Hippodrome for one year. Andrews recalled: [...] "Starlight Roof" [...] saying, [...] "There was this wonderful American person and comedian, Wally Boag, who made balloon animals.
