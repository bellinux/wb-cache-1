5|$|B. i. coromandus {{differs from}} the {{nominate}} subspecies in breeding plumage, when the buff colour on its head extends to the cheeks <b>and</b> <b>throat,</b> and the plumes are more golden in colour. This subspecies' bill and tarsus are longer on average than in B. i. ibis. B. i. seychellarum is smaller and shorter-winged than the other forms. It has white cheeks <b>and</b> <b>throat,</b> like B. i. ibis, but the nuptial plumes are golden, as with B. i. coromandus. Individuals with abnormally grey, melanistic plumages have been recorded.|$|E

5|$|Immature {{birds are}} {{distinguished}} by their smaller size, smaller, duller-brown bill, dark grey chin <b>and</b> <b>throat,</b> and absent or underdeveloped head plumes, often just {{a scattering of}} yellow feathers. The crest is fully developed in birds aged three to four years, {{a year or two}} before breeding age.|$|E

5|$|Some of germanium's artificially-produced {{compounds}} {{are quite}} reactive and present an immediate hazard {{to human health}} on exposure.

30|$|X-ray CT {{technique}} {{has been used}} by numerous scholars (Withjack 1988; Akin and Kovscek 1999; Akin et al. 2000; Lü et al. 2012). The CT-measured porosities were compared with the porosities measured by laboratory core analysis (Table  6). Since only the porosity of connected pores <b>and</b> <b>throats</b> was counted by CT technique and liquids could not flow into some very small pores <b>and</b> <b>throats,</b> the CT-measured porosities were a little smaller than the porosities measured by laboratory core analysis. For these reasons, the reliability of data obtained by X-ray CT technique is ensured.|$|R
5|$|The great frigatebird was venerated by the Rapa Nui {{people on}} Easter Island; carvings of the birdman Tangata manu depict {{him with the}} {{characteristic}} hooked beak <b>and</b> <b>throat</b> pouch.

5|$|According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, {{short-term}} {{exposure to}} platinum salts may cause irritation of the eyes, nose, <b>and</b> <b>throat,</b> and long-term exposure may cause both respiratory and skin allergies.

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) for platinum as 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday.|$|E
40|$|A soil-water {{characteristic}} curve with hydraulic hysteresis is derived using fractals by treating pores as either bodies or throats. As suction is increased {{along the main}} drying curve, drying of a body {{is controlled by the}} largest throat connected to it. As suction is reduced along the main wetting curve, the absorbed water collects in the smallest bodies <b>and</b> <b>throats</b> first, <b>and</b> then fills larger bodies <b>and</b> <b>throats</b> in order of size. The curve is fitted to data for a silt loam. The fit is reasonable for main drying and wetting curves, but less good for scanning curves...|$|R

5|$|After {{ending his}} {{coaching}} career, Wurtenburg {{spent several years}} acting as a referee for Yale's football team.

Echolalia (repeating the words of others) and palilalia (repeating one's own words) occur in a minority of cases, while the most common initial motor and vocal tics are, respectively, eye blinking <b>and</b> <b>throat</b> clearing.|$|E

5|$|Hepatitis: During the 1940s the cause, {{method of}} {{communication}} and treatment of infectious hepatitis was not well understood. Experimentation began with COs working at psychiatric hospitals and was expanded to a major research project with 30 to 60 test subjects at the University of Pennsylvania and Yale University.

5|$|Lithium is {{corrosive}} {{and requires}} special handling to avoid skin contact. Breathing lithium dust or lithium compounds (which are often alkaline) initially irritate the nose <b>and</b> <b>throat,</b> while higher exposure {{can cause a}} buildup of fluid in the lungs, leading to pulmonary edema. The metal itself is a handling hazard because contact with moisture produces the caustic lithium hydroxide. Lithium is safely stored in non-reactive compounds such as naphtha.|$|E
5|$|More specifically, the {{nominate}} subspecies has a grey forehead, crown, nape, ear-coverts <b>and</b> <b>throat</b> {{with the}} face a darker grey-black. The feathers of the throat are longer, giving rise to hackles there. The upperparts and underparts are a brownish-grey and become more brown with age. Towards the belly, the feathers are a paler grey. The wings are grey-brown, and the blackish primaries have white edges which merge to form the prominent white wing markings.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{symptoms}} {{are similar to}} other viral diseases such as influenza and the common cold: fever of at least , muscle pain, malaise, headache and prostration. As the digestive tract is commonly involved, nausea and vomiting and backache often occur. The prodrome, or preeruptive stage, usually lasts 2–4 days. By days 12–15 the first visible lesions—small reddish spots called enanthem—appear on mucous membranes of the mouth, tongue, palate, <b>and</b> <b>throat,</b> and temperature falls to near normal. These lesions rapidly enlarge and rupture, releasing large amounts of virus into the saliva.|$|E
30|$|The {{reservoir}} and seepage {{capacities of}} fluids in the pores of rocks are commonly influenced by pores <b>and</b> <b>throats.</b> According {{to the constant}} pressure mercury intrusion experiments of 13 samples, {{it is found that}} there is a good positive correlation between movable fluid saturation and effective pore volume per unit of rocks, with the correlation coefficient of 0.6279 (Fig.  7 a), while there is a less positive correlation between movable fluid saturation <b>and</b> effective <b>throat</b> volume per unit of rocks, with the correlation coefficient of 0.3955 (Fig.  7 b). Fluids in Chang 81 reservoir in the Maling Oilfield mainly occur in the effective pores <b>and</b> <b>throats.</b> Those in the effective pores have stronger seepage capacity, and the movable fluid saturation is more correlated with pore space, while those in the throats suffer poor connectivity and strong bound resistance, making it difficult for fluid to flow.|$|R
