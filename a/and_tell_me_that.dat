500|$|The U.S. Wonderbra rollout {{included}} {{events with}} Eva Herzigová in New York's Times Square. The advertisements were toned down {{in comparison to}} the earlier UK campaign. The U.S. print and billboard advertising showed models wearing only the Wonderbra. Underneath read slogans such as [...] "who cares if it's a bad hair day" [...] and [...] "look me in the eyes <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you love me." [...] The $25 Million campaign worked in conjunction to the ongoing media interest in the bra. Although Playtex promoted the authenticity of their [...] "One and Only Wonderbra", the rapid introduction of competitive products meant that the overall U.S. market benefited from a 43% increase in push-up bra sales by the end of 1994.|$|E
500|$|Shakira was {{mindful of}} the many critics who would judge her second album, because of the [...] "phenomenon" [...] label applied to her. She knew that some would say that [...] "she had changed too much" [...] and others would reproach her if she {{remained}} the same. [...] "All I could do was to be myself. I understood that all I {{had to do was}} write the music I knew how to write and to write from the heart when I was compelled to. In that way, everything developed naturally, more so than I could have imagined", she said. In addition, Shakira insisted on perfection, working on the material to the point of exhaustion. [...] "I made two or three demos of each song. I became a human being so demanding of myself that until the song made my hair stand on end, I wouldn't stop". For the recording of Dónde Están los Ladrones? they were used old amplifiers to achieve a better sound, a German microphone with more than 40 years of existence and made several innovations in the instrumental mixes. Dónde Están los Ladrones? took nine months to produce in total, since more people worked on the album compared with her previous record. Shakira commented, [...] "To me it's a normal time, the gestation period for a baby. But many people wag their finger <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the next one cannot take so long..." ...|$|E
500|$|From 1904 onwards, Bondfield was {{increasingly}} occupied {{with the issue}} of women's suffrage. In that year she travelled with Dora Montefiore of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) to the International Congress of Women in Berlin, but she was not in sympathy with the main WSPU policy, which was to secure the vote for women on the same highly restricted basis that it was then given to men. This involved a property qualification, and thus largely excluded the working class. Bondfield saw no benefit in this policy to the women that she represented, and aligned herself with the Adult Suffrage Society (ASS), which campaigned for universal adult suffrage, men and women alike, regardless of property. In 1906 she became chairman of the society and supported the Franchise and Removal of Women's Disabilities bill, introduced to parliament by Sir Charles Dilke. This proposed full adult suffrage, and the right of women to become MPs. The bill was [...] "talked out" [...] in the House of Commons, but Bondfield's support antagonised many militants in the WSPU, who considered the bill a distraction from their more limited aims. In 1907, {{in the course of a}} public debate with Teresa Billington-Greig of the Women's Freedom League (a breakaway group from the WSPU), Bondfield argued that the only way forward was a bill that enfranchised all men and all women, without qualification. She wished good luck to those fighting for a [...] "same terms as men" [...] suffrage bill, but [...] "don't let them come <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> they are working for my class". The strains of her duties and constant campaigning began to undermine her health, and in 1908 she resigned her union post after ten years' service, during which NAUSAWC membership had risen to over 20,000. Her departure, she said, was [...] "alike a grief and a deliverance".|$|E

2500|$|In 1916, he {{was given}} the title of Lance Corporal, which he was very proud of. Alexei's {{favorites}} were the foreigners of Belgium, Britain, France, Japan, Italy, and Serbia, and in favor, adopted him as their mascot. Hanbury-Williams, whom Alexei liked, wrote [...] " [...] As time went on and his shyness wore off he treated us like old friends and… had always some bit fun with us. With me it was to make sure that each button on my coat was properly fastened, a habit which naturally made me take great care to have one or two unbuttoned, in which case he used to at once to stop <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I was 'untidy again,' give a sigh at my lack of attention to these details and stop and carefully button me up again.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Chesterton's {{fence is}} the {{principle}} that reforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing state of affairs is understood. The quotation is from Chesterton’s 1929 book The Thing: Why I am a Catholic, in the chapter, [...] "The Drift from Domesticity": [...] "In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists {{in such a case}} a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away." [...] To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: [...] "If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What I {{thought of}} the larger work," [...] Winterfield answered. [...] "I could look at it by the hour together." [...] He {{consulted}} his watch.

60|$|Always, {{during my}} childhood, {{at this stage}} of the dream, did I wake up {{screaming}} with fright--to find, often, my mother or nurse, anxious and startled, by my bedside, passing soothing hands through my hair <b>and</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> they were there and that there was nothing to fear.|$|R

6000|$|... "No {{difficulties}}," [...] was the ironical reply. [...] "She has shut {{herself up}} in the stoutest castle in Italy, <b>and</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> she will not come forth until I promise her freedom of {{choice in the matter}} of marriage. Clearly, there are no difficulties attached to her being brought back." ...|$|R
