25|$|During the 16th century, the Kuching {{area was}} known to Portuguese cartographers as Cerava, {{one of the five}} great {{seaports}} on the island of Borneo. It was {{under the influence of the}} Bruneian Empire and was self-governed under Sultan Tengah. By the early 19th century, Sarawak had become a loosely governed territory under the control of the Brunei Sultanate. The Bruneian Empire had authority only along the coastal regions of Sarawak held by semi-independent Malay leaders. Meanwhile, the interior of Sarawak suffered from tribal wars fought by Iban, Kayan, and Kenyah peoples, who aggressively fought to expand their territories. Following the discovery of <b>antimony</b> <b>ore</b> in the Kuching region, Pangeran Indera Mahkota (a representative of the Sultan of Brunei) began to develop the territory between 1824 and 1830. When antimony production increased, the Brunei Sultanate demanded higher taxes from Sarawak; this led to civil unrest and chaos. In 1839, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II (1827–1852), ordered his uncle Pangeran Muda Hashim to restore order. It was around this time that James Brooke (who would later become the first White Rajah of Sarawak) arrived in Sarawak, and Pangeran Muda Hashim requested his assistance in the matter, but Brooke refused. However, he agreed to a further request during his next visit to Sarawak in 1841. Pangeran Muda Hashim signed a treaty in 1841 surrendering Sarawak to Brooke. On 24 September 1841, Pangeran Muda Hashim bestowed the title of governor on James Brooke. This appointment was later confirmed by the Sultan of Brunei in 1842. In 1843, James Brooke decided to create a pro-British Brunei government by installing Pangeran Muda Hashim into the Brunei Court as he would be taking the Brooke's advice. James Brooke forced Brunei to appoint Hashim under the guns of East India Company's steamer Phlegethon. The Brunei Court was unhappy with Hashim's appointment and had him assassinated in 1845. In retaliation, James Brooke attacked the Kampong Ayer, the capital of Brunei. After the incident, the Sultan of Brunei sent an apology letter to Queen Victoria. The sultan also confirmed James Brooke's possession of Sarawak and his mining rights of antimony without paying tribute to Brunei. In 1846 Brooke effectively became the Rajah of Sarawak and founded the White Rajah Dynasty of Sarawak.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the major and trace element composition and Pb and Sr isotope {{characteristics of a}} series of about 20 colourless glass objects from a single high-status Roman burial from the Netherlands (Bocholtz). The major elements show a relatively homogeneous group, with one outlier. This is corroborated by the Sr isotopes. Based on the Sb and Pb content, three major groups can be discerned, with two other outliers. This grouping is corroborated by the contents of the trace elements Bi, Sn, Ag, As and Mo, and by variations in lead isotopic ratios. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the glass of all objects was probably made with sand and lime from the same source. The variation in trace elements and lead isotope composition is most likely the result of variations in the composition of the sulphidic antimony ore(s) that were used to decolourize the glass. The composition of the Bocholtz glass is compared with that of other Roman glass, and implications for production models, trade and use of colourless glass objects are discussed. On the basis of isotopic and major element variation, we conclude that the <b>antimony</b> <b>ore</b> presumably originated from different mines. © 2009 University of Oxford...|$|E

40|$|Based on {{promising}} {{results obtained}} in earlier work on <b>antimony</b> <b>ores,</b> we {{have investigated the}} use of natural variation in the isotopic composition of Sb as determined using multi-collector ICP-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) for provenancing Roman glasses. In antiquity, Sb was used either as a decolourizer or as an opacifier and thus, colourless and opaque coloured glasses from different regions and periods were selected for investigation. Both, the sample digestion and isolation of Sb preceeding isotopic analysis via MC-ICP-MS have been optimized and validated {{for this type of}} materials. For this purpose, NIST SRM 610 glass reference material and an in-house standard were employed. Isotope ratio determinations were carried out by MC-ICP-MS, relying on In as an internal standard for correction for instrumental mass discrimination. The merits of external calibration in a sample-standard bracketing approach and the so-called "revised Russell's law" for mass bias correction were compared, with the latter providing higher precision and better reproducibility. The Sb- 123 /Sb- 121 isotope ratio in glass could be determined with a reproducibility (or external precision) of ca. 0. 4 epsilon, while in Roman colourless and Hellenistic opaque glass samples, a variation of 3 to 4 epsilon units was found. The results seem to suggest the use of similar Sb sources for both types of glasses, and the existence of at least two different Sb sources for glass production in the Roman era...|$|R

We have focussed on "hydraulic fracturing" process for the genesis of the Ichinokawa conglomerate. Ichinokawa conglomerate can be divided mainly into Ichinokawa breccia and Myojin Group. Carbonate-rich breccia and sandstone filling fractures are also found in the Sanbagawa schists adjacent to the Ichinokawa breccia. High-angle breccia zones, the Ichinokawa breccia, cut across the Sanbagawa schistocity. The Ichinokawa breccia consist principally of breccias which have been partly altered and veined by quartz, carbonate minerals and pyrite, and matrix of carbonate-rich sandstone. Schist clasts (up to 10 m across) in the breccia are angular but not variably rotated. Breccias are both clast- and matrix-supported and show evidence for single fracturing and healing by hydrothermally precipitated minerals such as carbonate minerals, pyrite, stibnite, pyrite and quartz. Two Sb and As-rich zones in the Ichinokawa breccia along the Ichinokawa River are about 10 - 30 m wide adjacent to the Sanbagawa schists. As and Sb values of carbonate matrix in the breccia are extremely high. These observations suggest that the the Ichinokawa breccia formed through a hydrofracturing process associated with hydrothermal fluid infiltrated into Sanbagawa metamorphic as precursor of the <b>antimony</b> <b>ore</b> forming. Hydrothernal fluid seems to have caused mineralization of carbonate minerals and sulfide minerals. Afterwards, the Myojin Group was accumulated above on the Ichinokawa breccia...|$|E
