40|$|Abstract – This paper {{provides}} a theoretical {{characterization of the}} multihop wireless communications channel. Four channel models are proposed and developed: the decoded relaying multihop channel, the <b>amplified</b> <b>relaying</b> multihop channel, the decoded relaying multihop diversity channel, and the <b>amplified</b> <b>relaying</b> multihop diversity channel. Two classifications are discussed: decoded <b>relaying</b> versus <b>amplified</b> <b>relaying</b> and multihop versus multihop diversity. When comparing decoded <b>relaying</b> with <b>amplified</b> <b>relaying</b> the primary considerations are noise propagation, error introduction, and delay. When comparing multihop with multihop diversity the primary considerations are performance and complexity. These models are compared, through analysis and simulations, with the singlehop reference channel {{on the basis of}} power distribution and probability of error.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} theoretical characterizations {{and analysis}} for the physical layer of multihop wireless communications channels. Four channel models are considered and developed: the decoded relaying multihop channel; the <b>amplified</b> <b>relaying</b> multihop channel; the decoded relaying multihop diversity channel; and the <b>amplified</b> <b>relaying</b> multihop diversity channel. Two classifications are discussed: decoded <b>relaying</b> versus <b>amplified</b> <b>relaying,</b> and multihop channels versus multihop diversity channels. The channel models are compared, through analysis and simulations, with the “singlehop ” (direct transmission) reference channel {{on the basis of}} signal-to-noise ratio, probability of outage, probability of error, and optimal power allocation. Each of the four channel models is shown to outperform the singlehop reference channel under the condition that the set of intermediate relaying terminals is selected intelligently. Multihop diversity channels are shown to outperform multihop channels. <b>Amplified</b> <b>relaying</b> is shown to outperform decoded relaying despite noise propagation. This is attributed to the fact that <b>amplified</b> <b>relaying</b> does not suffer from the error propagation which limits the performance of decoded relaying channels to that of their weakest link.

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{considers}} the aggregate {{signal to noise}} ratio of <b>amplified</b> <b>relaying</b> channels, where the term aggregate refers to the inclusion of propagated noise terms generated as <b>relaying</b> terminals <b>amplify</b> both the information and noise portions of received signals. This consideration is motivated by recent findings for wireless relaying networks indicating that the performance of <b>amplified</b> <b>relaying</b> can approach and in some cases exceed the performance of decoded relaying [2, 3, 5 - 7].

40|$|The {{broadcast}} {{nature of}} the wireless medium makes the communication over this medium vulnerable to eavesdropping. This report considers the problem of secret communication between two nodes, over a fading wireless medium, {{in the presence of}} a passive eavesdropper. The assumption used is that the transmitter and its helpers (<b>amplifying</b> <b>relays)</b> have more antennas than the eavesdropper. The transmitter ensures secrecy of communication by utilizing some of the available power to produce ‘artificial noise’, such that only the eavesdropper’s channel is degraded. Two scenarios are considered, one where the transmitter has multiple transmit antennas, and the other where <b>amplifying</b> <b>relays</b> simulate the effect of multiple antennas. The channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be publicly known, and hence, the secrecy of communication is independent of the secrecy of CSI...|$|R

40|$|For two-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay systems, the uplink-downlink duality {{has been}} {{recently}} investigated. In this paper, we establish the duality between uplink and downlink multi-hop AF-MIMO relay channels with {{any number of}} hops {{and any number of}} antennas at each node, which is a further generalization of several previously established results. We show that in the downlink relay system, signal-to-interference-noise ratios (SINRs) identical to those in the uplink relay system, and vice versa, can be achieved by two approaches. First, with the same total network transmission power constraint, one simply applies Hermitian transposed uplink <b>relay</b> <b>amplifying</b> matrices at <b>relay</b> nodes in the downlink system. Second, with transmission power constraint at each node of the relay network, one can use scaled and Hermitian transposed uplink <b>relay</b> <b>amplifying</b> matrices in the downlink system, with scaling factors obtained by switching power constraints at different nodes of the uplink system.
