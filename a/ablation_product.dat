It is also shown that, for Venusian entry, the spectral distribution of radiative flux and the magnitude of radiation absorption by ablation products depend strongly on entry velocity, and that the state of the boundary layer can significantly influence the amount of <b>ablation</b> <b>product</b> absorption or emission that occurs in various spectral regions...|$|E

40|$|First online: 17 December 2014 The {{mechanism}} of atomic indium generation for laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) of indium from laser ablation seeding {{was investigated in}} a hydrogen/nitrogen non-premixed flame. The morphology and particle size distributions of the <b>ablation</b> <b>products</b> were examined with scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. These investigations show that the <b>ablation</b> <b>products</b> comprise complex agglomerates of nano-sized primary particles of indium compounds and micron-sized spherical indium beads. Images of the atomic indium LIF, Mie scattering of <b>ablation</b> <b>products</b> and natural fluorescence emission of indium in the flame were recorded to investigate the {{mechanism of}} fluorescence signal generation. The relative contribution of natural fluorescence emission of indium towards the total indium fluorescence signal was assessed by comparing these images. These images also reveal the evolution of <b>ablation</b> <b>products</b> through the flame structure and the correlation between LIF signal and <b>ablation</b> <b>products.</b> It is found that the LIF signal generation {{is associated with the}} vapourisation of indium nanoparticles into the gas phase by thermal decomposition in the flame. A further mechanism for thermal decomposition of the nanoparticles was also identified, that of heating the <b>ablation</b> <b>products</b> by in situ laser ablation. This was assessed by means of a second laser, introduced prior to the excitation laser, to reveal that the LIF signal can be enhanced by in situ laser ablation, particularly in the upstream regions of the flame. These findings supersede the mechanism deduced previously by the authors that neutral atomic indium can survive a convection time of the order of tens of seconds and be directly seeded into reacting or non-reacting flows. The possible influences of laser ablation seeding on the nonlinear two-line atomic fluorescence thermometry technique were also assessed. D. H. Gu, Z. W. Sun, P. R. Medwell, Z. T. Alwahabi, B. B.

The main components of <b>ablation</b> <b>products</b> are clusters that form during flight of <b>ablation</b> <b>products</b> {{and as a result}} of separation of SiOx-clusters from the zone of the irradiation channel.

40|$|Thermochemical nonequilibrium in {{the shock}} layer {{surrounding}} vehicles entering the atmospheres {{of earth and}} Mars at superescape velocities is studied, deriving reaction rate coefficients that reproduce experimental data obtained in shock tubes. Thermodynamic properties and emitted radiation intensities are obtained for shock tube flow and flow in a shock layer over a blunt body. The {{results indicate that the}} viscous layer of the <b>ablation</b> <b>product</b> over an ablating heat shield is likely to be in chemical nonequilbrium. For earth entry flight, the thickness of the nonequilbrium region is between and 2 cm at the expected peak radiation point in the aerobraking trajectory, For Martian entry flight it is between 8 and 23 cm. For the earth entry case, nonequilibrium phenomena reduce radiative heating rate, while the opposite occurs for the Martian case. The radiative heat transfer rates are significant for the Mars entry conditions at entry velocities equal to or greater than 7 km/s...|$|E
40|$|Photoacoustic and {{photothermal}} laser‐beam deflection {{were applied}} as diagnostics of the pulsed ultraviolet (UV) laser ablation of a polymer polyethyleneterephthalate. Here, a continuous‐wave (cw) laser beam is passed {{parallel to the}} sample, but displaced from it by a few hundred micrometers. A density gradient caused by the pulsed UV laser heating or ablation of the sample deflects the cw laser beam. This deflection is measured directly using a position‐sensitive detector. A quantitative model of the photothermal deflection at low fluence was developed which fits the data very well. This enabled a new method of measuring the thermal diffusivity of the fluid {{in contact with the}} sample. Distortion of the photothermal and photoacoustic signal as the excimer fluence is raised through the ablation threshold allowed the determination of the threshold. Also, the velocity of the ablation products was measured through a time‐of‐flight analysis and found to be dependent on the laser fluence used, the nature of the gas above the sample, and the distance above the sample at which the velocity is measured. The beam deflection in a vacuum is used to measure the <b>ablation</b> <b>product</b> velocity...|$|E
40|$|Hydrodynamic {{phenomena}} from KrF {{excimer laser}} ablation (10 − 3 – 20 J/cm 2) of polyimide, polyethyleneterephthalate, and aluminum are diagnosed by schlieren photography, shadowgraphy, and dye laser resonance absorption photography (DLRAP). Experiments were performed both in vacuum and gaseous environments (10 − 5 – 760 Torr air, nitrogen, and argon). In vacuum, ablation plumes are observed to expand like a reflected rarefaction wave. As the background gas pressure is increased, shock waves and reduced‐density ablation plumes become visible. Below 10 Torr, the ablation plume follows closely behind the shock wave. Between 20 and 100 Torr, the plume recedes behind the shock wave. Below 10 Torr and above about 200 Torr, both the plume and the shock expand {{with the same}} temporal power law dependence. Agreement is found between these power law dependences and those predicted by ideal blast wave theory. The DLRAP diagnostic clearly shows that the ablated material (CN molecule from polyimide and ground state neutral aluminum atoms from laser‐ablated aluminum) resides in the ablation plume. CN molecules are detected in both argon and air environments proving that CN is generated as an <b>ablation</b> <b>product</b> and not by reaction with the background gas. As the background gas pressure and the time after ablation is increased, the film darkening due to the laser‐ablated material begins to fade leaving only the nonresonant shadowgraphy component of the plume. The plume dynamics observed by DLRAP are {{discussed in terms of}} gas dynamics, plume chemical kinetics, material diffusion in the plume, and cluster/particulate formation...|$|E

40|$|A high-fidelity {{approach}} for simulating the aerothermodynamic environments of meteor entries is developed. Two primary components {{of this model}} are coupled radiation and coupled ablation. Coupled radiation accounts {{for the impact of}} radiation on the flow field energy equations, while coupled ablation explicitly models the injection of <b>ablation</b> <b>products</b> within the flow field and radiation simulations. For a meteoroid with a velocity of 20 km/s, coupled radiation reduces the stagnation point radiative heating by over 60 %. For altitudes below 40 km, the impact of coupled radiation on the flow field structure is shown to be fundamentally different, {{as a result of the}} large optical thicknesses, than that seen for reentry vehicles, which do not reach such altitudes at velocities greater than 10 km/s. The impact of coupled ablation (with coupled radiation) is shown to provide at least a 70 % reduction in the radiative heating relative to the coupled-radiation-only cases. This large reduction is partially the result of the low ionization energies, relative to air species, of <b>ablation</b> <b>products.</b> The low ionization energies of <b>ablation</b> <b>products,</b> such as Mg and Ca, provide strong photoionization and atomic line absorption in regions of the spectrum that air species do not. MgO and CaO are also shown to provide significant absorption. Turbulence is shown to impact the distribution of <b>ablation</b> <b>products</b> through the shock- layer, which results in up to a 100 % increase in the radiative heating downstream of the stagnation point. To create a database of heat transfer coefficients the developed model was applied to a range of cases. This database considered velocities ranging from 14 to 20 km/s, altitudes ranging from 20 to 50 km, and nose radii ranging from 1 to 100 m. The heat transfer coefficients from these simulations are below 0. 045 for the range of cases (with turbulence), which is significantly lower than the canonical value of 0. 1...|$|R
40|$|Ultrafast laser sources with pulse {{durations}} in the sub-picosecond regime {{enable a}} precise machining of various materials. Pulse durations {{shorter than the}} electron phonon-coupling time lead to a low thermal load or even non-thermal ablation processes. Exploiting non-linear absorption processes, the absorption becomes nearly material independent when laser pulses of several microjoule energy and high beam quality {{are focused on the}} materials surface. Low pulse energies and intensities well above the vaporization threshold and therefore an eduction of the absorbed energy within the <b>ablation</b> <b>product</b> enables a high-precision cutting, ablation and drilling of, even weakly absorbing materials, multi-component and multi-layer systems. Additional, the focusing of ultrafast laser pulses in the volume of transparent dielectrics allows a localized modification of the bulk material. Specifically, defined refractive index changes in glasses and crystals can be utilized for waveguiding and beam-forming applications. A combined approach of material modification followed by chemical etching provides the possibility to manufacture micro-channels or 3 D-micro mechanical parts. The 3 D-capability of the in-volume material processing originates from the non-linear absorption of light in the initially transparent material. To achieve high process efficiencies in material processing, laser sources delivering high average power are necessary. High average power is achieved either by high pulse energies and low repetition rates or high pulse repetition rates and moderate pulse energies. The optimum set of parameters is strongly depending on the process, the material and the application. In this paper, we present compact laser sources with a high flexibility in pulse energy and pulse repetition rate and an average power of several hundreds of Watt. Additional, a broad range of applications, from micro- and nanostructuring of various materials to volume processing of dielectrics will be presented...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the risk of}} finding an infiltrating endometrial carcinoma when atypical hyperplasia (AH) or FIGO stage IA carcinoma were diagnosed on endometrial biopsy by Novak curette during ambulatory hysteroscopy or on pathological analysis of endometrial <b>ablation</b> <b>product</b> during operatoring hysteroscopy. METHOD: Retrospective unicentric study from 2000 to 2006 including 107 patients. Total hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy was performed on 95 of them. All patients had initial diagnosis of AH or FIGO stage IA carcinoma realised either by biopsy with Novak curette performed according to hysteroscopic data (52 cases), or on product of endometrial ablation (43 cases). AH and stage IA carcinoma were voluntarily studied together because of the same surgical treatment {{and because it is}} acknowledged that no complementary treatment is necessary if lesion remains intramucous. However, in presence of myometrial infiltration, the risk of lymph node infiltration exists and lymphadenectomy must be discussed. RESULTS: Out of the 95 hysterectomy specimens, 20 infiltrating endometrial carcinoma were diagnosed (21 %). The risk of discovering an infiltrating endometrial carcinoma when diagnosis of AH or stage IA carcinoma is done by biopsy with Novak curette is 32. 7 % (17 out of 52 patients). Let's note that 30 % of these ambulatory hysteroscopies (5 out of 17) were non suspect. When diagnosis is done on the products of endometrial ablation, infiltrating carcinoma is observed on the hysterectomy piece in 6. 9 % of cases (3 out of 43 patients). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Presence of AH or stage IA endometrial carcinoma on endometrial biopsies or on products of endometrial ablation can be associated with infiltrating endometrial carcinoma. In presence of AH or stage IA carcinoma diagnosed on biopsy with Novak curette, the incidence of infiltrating carcinoma on hysterectomy product is sizeable (32. 7 %) and check-up of infiltrating endometrial carcinoma should be realised with the view to state the prognostic factors and the possible indication of lymphadenectomy.

40|$|Thermal {{radiation}} of the heat-shield and {{the emission}} of the post-shock layer around the Stardust capsule, during its re-entry, were detected by a NASA-led observation campaign aboard NASA's DC- 8 airborne observatory involving teams from several nations. The German SLIT experiment used a conventional spectrometer, in a Czerny-Turner configuration (300 mm focal length and a 600 lines/mm grating), fed by fiber optics, {{to cover a}} wavelength range from 324 nm to 456 nm with a pixel resolution of 0. 08 nm. The reentering spacecraft was tracked m uansuinaglly a camera with a view angle of 20 degrees, and light from the capsule was collected using a small mirror telescope with a view angle of only 0. 45 degrees. Data were gathered with a measurement frequency of 5 Hz in a 30 -second time interval around the point of maximum heating until the capsule left the field of view. The emission of CN (as a major <b>ablation</b> <b>product),</b> N 2 (+) and different atoms were monitored successfully during that time. Due {{to the nature of}} the experimental set up, spatial resolution of the radiation field was not possible. Therefore, all measured values represent an integration of radiation from the visible part of the glowing heat shield, and from the plasma in the post-shock region. Further, due to challenges in tracking not every spectrum gathered contained data. The measured spectra can be split up into two parts: (i) continuum spectra which represent a superposition of the heat shield radiation and the continuum radiation of potential dust particles in the plasma, and (ii) line spectra from the plasma in the shock layer. Planck temperatures (interpreted as the surface temperatures of the Stardust heat shield) were determined assuming either a constant surface temperature, or a temperature distribution deduced from numerical simulation. The constant surface temperatures are in good agreement with numerical simulations, but the peak values at the stagnation point are significantly lower than those in the numerical simulation if a temperature distribution over the surface is assumed. Emission bands of CN and N 2 (+) were tracked along the visible trajectory and compared to a spectral simulation with satisfying agreement.

The capsule shear layer was also shown to generally appear to be more turbulent at lower angles of attack. Furthermore, the PLIF signal increased steadily {{over the course of a}} run indicating that during a wind tunnel run the model heated up and the rate of naphthalene ablation increased.
