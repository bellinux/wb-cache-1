5|$|In late 1866, Napoleon {{tried to}} {{postpone}} the French departure, but the <b>Americans</b> <b>had</b> large numbers of troops on the north bank of the Rio Grande and Seward held firm. Napoleon suggested a new Mexican government that would exclude both Maximilian and Juárez; the <b>Americans</b> <b>had</b> recognized Juárez as the legitimate president and were not willing to consider this. In the meantime, Juárez, {{with the help of}} American military aid, was advancing through northeast Mexico. The French withdrew in early 1867, leaving Maximilian, who was soon captured by Juárez's troops. Although both the U.S. and France urged Juárez against it, the deposed emperor was executed by firing squad on June 19, 1867.|$|E
5|$|In spiking {{the guns}} at the Red House battery, the <b>Americans</b> <b>had</b> {{accomplished}} {{the more important}} of their two objectives: an invading force could now land between Chippawa and Fort Erie without facing artillery fire. However, subsequent events would render their service useless.|$|E
5|$|Pontiac's War has {{traditionally}} been portrayed as a defeat for the Native Americans, but scholars now usually {{view it as a}} military stalemate: while the Native <b>Americans</b> <b>had</b> failed to drive away the British, the British were unable to conquer the Native Americans. Negotiation and accommodation, rather than success on the battlefield, ultimately brought an end to the war. The Native <b>Americans</b> <b>had</b> in fact won a victory of sorts by compelling the British government to abandon Amherst's policies and instead create a relationship with the Native Americans modeled on the Franco-Native alliance.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, interracial unions between Native Americans and African <b>Americans</b> <b>has</b> also existed {{throughout}} the 16th through early 20th century resulting in some African <b>Americans</b> <b>having</b> Native <b>American</b> heritage.|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} the United States of America entered the war in 1917—three {{years after the first}} shots were fired—several <b>Americans</b> <b>had</b> already gone to fight as pilots by joining the Royal Flying Corps.

5|$|In Nashville, {{like most}} Southern cities, African Americans were {{severely}} disadvantaged under {{the system of}} Jim Crow segregation. Besides being relegated to underfunded schools and barred from numerous public accommodations, African <b>Americans</b> <b>had</b> few prospects for skilled employment and were subject to constant discrimination from the white majority.|$|E
5|$|Its lengthy {{period of}} {{visibility}} and extensive {{coverage in the}} media meant that Hale–Bopp was probably the most-observed comet in history, making a far greater impact on the general public than the return of Halley's Comet in 1986, and certainly seen by {{a greater number of}} people than witnessed any of Halley's previous appearances. For instance, 69% of <b>Americans</b> <b>had</b> seen Hale–Bopp by April 9, 1997.|$|E

50|$|Throughout US history, Mexican <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> and {{continue}} to endure various types of negative stereotypes which have long circulated in media and popular culture.

5|$|Nuclear war, or {{at least}} {{deployed}} nuclear arms, is mentioned in almost all of Vonnegut's novels. In Player Piano, the computer EPICAC is given control of the nuclear arsenal, and is charged with deciding whether to use high-explosive or nuclear arms. In Cat's Cradle, John's original purpose in setting pen to paper is to write an account of what prominent <b>Americans</b> <b>had</b> been doing as Hiroshima was bombed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Americans</b> <b>had</b> already {{launched}} their carrier aircraft against the Japanese. Fletcher, in overall command aboard Yorktown, and benefiting from PBY sighting {{reports from the}} early morning, ordered Spruance to launch against the Japanese as soon as was practical, while initially holding Yorktown in reserve in case any other Japanese carriers were found.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, a {{messenger}} from Black Hawk had shouted to the militiamen that the starving British Band {{was going back}} across the Mississippi and would fight no more. No one in the American camp understood the message, however, since their Ho-Chunk guides were not present to interpret. Black Hawk may have believed that the <b>Americans</b> <b>had</b> gotten the message, {{and that they had}} not pursued him after the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. He apparently expected that the Americans were going to let his band recross the Mississippi unmolested.|$|E
50|$|A Soldier's Play is a drama by Charles Fuller. The play uses {{a murder}} mystery {{to explore the}} {{complicated}} feelings of anger and resentment that some African <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> toward one another, {{and the ways in}} which many black <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> absorbed white racist attitudes.|$|R
50|$|In {{some areas}} where Asian <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> large populations, Asian <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> elected Asian <b>American</b> {{candidates}} {{at the city}} and local level; examples of this include Vietnamese Americans in Orange County and Chinese Americans in San Francisco.

5|$|Air America {{helicopters}} {{continued to}} make rooftop pickups until after nightfall by which time navigation became increasingly difficult. Helicopters overflew the designated LZs to check no <b>Americans</b> <b>had</b> been left behind and then the last helicopters (many low on fuel) headed out to TF76, located the USS Midway or the USS Hancock and shut down. All Air America flights had ceased by 21:00. With its available fleet of only 20 Hueys (3 of which were impounded, ditched or damaged at TF76), Air America had moved over 1,000 evacuees to the DAO Compound, the Embassy or out to the ships of TF76.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>Americans</b> <b>had</b> {{taken the}} vessel, Sterett had no orders to take prizes {{and so was}} obliged to release her. Enterprise {{completed}} her journey to Malta, and received honor and praise from the squadron's Commodore on her return to the fleet. The success of the battle boosted morale in the United States, since it was that country's first victory {{in the war against}} the Tripolitans. The opposite occurred in Tripoli, where morale sank heavily upon learning of Tripoli defeat. Despite Enterprise triumph, the war continued indecisively for another four years.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} President Reagan {{had given his}} first speech on the epidemic, some six years into his presidency, 36,058 <b>Americans</b> <b>had</b> been {{diagnosed}} with AIDS and 20,849 had died of it. By the end of 1989, the year Reagan left office, 115,786 people {{had been diagnosed with}} AIDS in the United States, and more than 70,000 of them had died of it. It has been suggested that far fewer would have died, both then and in the decades that followed, if the Reagan administration had applied the same determination in combatting AIDS as the Ford administration had applied to fighting Legionnaires' disease.|$|E
50|$|Altogether, genetic {{studies suggest}} that African Americans are a multiracial people. According to DNA {{analysis}} led in 2006 by Penn State geneticist Mark D. Shriver, around 58 percent of African <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> at least 12.5% European ancestry (equivalent to one European great-grandparent and his/her forebears), 19.6 percent of African <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> at least 25% European ancestry (equivalent to one European grandparent and his/her forebears), and 1 percent of African <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> at least 50% European ancestry (equivalent to one European parent and his/her forebears). According to Shriver, around 5 percent of African <b>Americans</b> also <b>have</b> at least 12.5% Native American ancestry (equivalent to one Native American great-grandparent and his/her forebears).|$|R

5|$|Carleton ordered {{most of the}} British army to sail upriver toward Sorel on June 9, {{but they}} did not {{actually}} leave until he joined them on June 13. A detachment of 1200 men under Fraser marched up the northern shore toward Berthier and Montreal. The British fleet arrived at Sorel late on the 14th; the <b>Americans</b> <b>had</b> left there just that morning. Elements of the British army entered Montreal on June 17, and also arrived at Fort Saint-Jean {{in time to see the}} last Americans (the very last one reported to be Benedict Arnold) push away from its burning remnants.|$|E
5|$|During the Seven Years' War (in America, {{known as}} the French and Indian War), British forces seized Canada from the French, but the francophone {{population}} remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the Native Americans, who were being conquered and displaced, the 13 British colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the {{rate of natural increase}} was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of <b>Americans</b> <b>had</b> been born overseas. The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, the British {{captured}} the fort in the Siege of Fort Mackinac, the first {{battle of the}} conflict, because the <b>Americans</b> <b>had</b> not yet heard that war had been declared. The victorious British attempted to protect their prize by building Fort George on the high ground behind Fort Mackinac. In 1814, the Americans and British fought a second battle {{on the north side}} of the island. The American second-in-command, Major Andrew Holmes, was killed and the Americans failed to recapture the island.|$|E

50|$|Many African <b>Americans</b> {{believe they}} <b>have</b> some Native <b>American</b> ancestry. But, in the PBS series led by {{historian}} Henry Louis Gates, Jr., called African American Lives, geneticists said DNA {{evidence shows that}} African-Native American admixture is relatively rare. Gates summarized the data:Only 5 percent of African <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> at least one-eighth Native American ancestry (equivalent to one great-grandparent). On the other hand, nearly 78 percent of African <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> at least one-eighth European ancestry (the equivalent to a great-grandparent), and nearly 20 percent have at least one-quarter European ancestry (the equivalent to a grandparent.)Historian Sherrel Wheeler Stewart says that most African <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> Native <b>American</b> ancestry.|$|R
5|$|Following graduation, Brown {{sought to}} enroll in a college outside of the South. His principal, Nathaniel Burger, advised he attend an all-black college, as his brother Marvin Brown had done, however, he ended up enrolling at Ohio State University as his {{childhood}} role model, Jesse Owens, had done. Burger told Brown only seven African <b>Americans</b> <b>had</b> graduated from the school that year, but Brown nonetheless was determined to enroll, feeling he would compete well with white students.|$|E
5|$|For twenty years, <b>Americans</b> <b>had</b> been bitterly {{divided over}} the nation's {{monetary}} standard. The gold standard, which the United States had effectively been on since 1873, limited {{the money supply}} but eased trade with other nations, such as the United Kingdom, whose currency was also based on gold. Many Americans, however, believed that bimetallism (making both gold and silver legal tender) was necessary for the nation's economic health. The financial Panic of 1893 intensified the debates, and when Democratic President Grover Cleveland continued to support the gold standard against the will of much of his party, activists became determined {{to take over the}} Democratic Party organization and nominate a silver-supporting candidate in 1896.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s, {{tensions}} {{were growing}} between the North and South over various issues including slavery. The Wilmot Proviso, introduced in 1846, contributed to these tensions; if passed, {{it would have}} banned slavery in any land acquired from Mexico. The Compromise of 1850 brought a temporary respite, but the Dred Scott case, decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1857, spurred public debate. Chief Justice Roger Taney ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional and that African <b>Americans</b> <b>had</b> no standing as citizens under the constitution. Northerners were outraged and there was increasing talk in the South of secession from the Union.|$|E
