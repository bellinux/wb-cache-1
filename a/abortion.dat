5|$|A 2004 {{analysis}} of data from 53 studies involving 83,000 women with breast cancer reported no increased risk among women who had had either an induced or spontaneous <b>abortion.</b> The relative {{risk of breast cancer}} for women who had a spontaneous <b>abortion</b> in this analysis was 0.98, and that for induced <b>abortion</b> was 0.93.|$|E
5|$|<b>Abortion</b> is the {{intentional}} termination of pregnancy, {{as compared to}} spontaneous termination (miscarriage). <b>Abortion</b> is closely allied to contraception in terms of women's control and regulation of their reproduction, and is often subject to similar cultural, religious, legislative and economic constraints. Where access to contraception is limited, women turn to <b>abortion.</b> Consequently, <b>abortion</b> rates {{may be used to}} estimate unmet needs for contraception. However the available procedures have carried great risk for women throughout most of history, and still do in the developing world, or where legal restrictions force women to seek clandestine facilities. Access to safe legal <b>abortion</b> places undue burdens on lower socioeconomic groups and in jurisdictions that create significant barriers. These issues have frequently been the subject of political and feminist campaigns where differing viewpoints pit health against moral values.|$|E

The tape claims that <b>abortion</b> prevented Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's would-be assassin, a fourth Stooge brother, of The Three Stooges, and Islamic extremist Osama bin Laden's America-loving brother from being born.|$|E

5|$|Globally, {{there were}} 87 million {{unwanted}} pregnancies in 2005, of those 46 million resorted to <b>abortion,</b> of which 18 million were considered unsafe, resulting in 68,000 deaths. The {{majority of these}} deaths occurred in the developing world. The United Nations considers these avoidable with access to safe <b>abortion</b> and post-abortion care. While <b>abortion</b> rates have fallen in developed countries, but not in developing countries. Between 2010–2014 there were 35 abortions per 1000 women aged 15–44, a total of 56 million abortions per year. The United nations has prepared recommendations for health care workers to provide more accessible and safe <b>abortion</b> and post-abortion care. An inherent part of post-abortion care involves provision of adequate contraception.|$|E
5|$|In {{her work}} How Kantian Ethics Should Treat Pregnancy and <b>Abortion,</b> Susan Feldman argues that <b>abortion</b> should be defended {{according}} to Kantian ethics. She proposed {{that a woman}} {{should be treated as}} a dignified autonomous person, with control over their body, as Kant suggested. She believes that the free choice of women would be paramount in Kantian ethics, requiring <b>abortion</b> to be the mother's decision. Dean Harris has noted that, if Kantian ethics is {{to be used in the}} discussion of <b>abortion,</b> it must be decided whether a fetus is an autonomous person. Kantian ethicist Carl Cohen argues that the potential to be rational or participation in a generally rational species is the relevant distinction between humans and inanimate objects or irrational animals. Cohen believes that even when humans are not rational because of age (such as babies or fetuses) or mental disability, agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves, equivalent to a rational adult such as a mother seeking an <b>abortion.</b>|$|E

50|$|MacPherson {{estimates}} that 100,000 sex-selective <b>abortions</b> every year {{continue to be}} performed in India. For a contrasting perspective, in the United States with a population th of India, over 1.2 million <b>abortions</b> every year were performed between 1990 and 2007. In England and Wales with a population th of India, over 189,000 <b>abortions</b> were performed in 2011, or a yearly rate of 17.5 <b>abortions</b> per 1,000 women aged 15-44. The average for the European Union was 30 <b>abortions</b> per year per 1,000 women.|$|R
5|$|Some anti-abortion {{activists have}} {{continued}} to advance a discredited causal link between <b>abortion</b> and breast cancer. In the United States, they have advanced state legislation that in several states requires health care providers to present <b>abortion</b> {{as a cause of}} breast cancer when counseling women who are seeking <b>abortion.</b> This political intervention culminated when the George W. Bush administration altered the National Cancer Institute website to suggest that <b>abortion</b> might cause breast cancer. In response to public concern over this intervention, the NCI convened a 2003 workshop bringing together over 100 experts on the issue. This workshop concluded that while some studies reported a statistical correlation between breast cancer and <b>abortion,</b> the strongest scientific evidence from large prospective cohort studies demonstrates that <b>abortion</b> is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk, and that the positive findings were likely due to response bias.|$|E

In 2013, the highest teenage birth rate was in Alabama, {{and the lowest}} in Wyoming. <b>Abortion</b> is legal throughout the U.S., owing to Roe v. Wade, a 1973 landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. While the <b>abortion</b> rate is falling, the <b>abortion</b> ratio of 241 per 1,000 live births and <b>abortion</b> rate of 15 per 1,000 women aged 15–44 remain {{higher than those of}} most Western nations.
