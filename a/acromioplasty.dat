50|$|Subacromial {{impingement}} is {{not free}} of criticism. First, the identification of acromion type shows poor intra- and inter-observer reliability. Second, a computerized three-dimensional study failed to support impingement by any portion of the acromion on the rotator cuff tendons in different shoulder positions. Third, most partial-thickness cuff tears do not occur on bursal surface fibers, where mechanical abrasion from the acromion does occur. Fourth, {{it has been suggested}} that bursal surface cuff tears could be responsible for subacromial spurs and not the opposite. And finally, there is growing evidence that routine <b>acromioplasty</b> may not be required for successful rotator cuff repair, which would be an unexpected finding if acromial shape had a major role in generating tendon lesions. In summary, despite being a popular theory, the bulk of evidence suggest that subacromial impingement probably does not play a dominant role in many cases of rotator cuff disease.|$|E

40|$|AIM: The role <b>acromioplasty</b> with rotator cu repair remains unclear. This study aims to {{test the}} null hypothesis—that <b>acromioplasty</b> in {{conjunction}} with rotator cuff repair {{has no effect on}} improvement in pain or shoulder function at two years follow up. METHODS: Data was obtained from a collaborative nationwide project between March 2009 and December 2010, and consisted of a total of 2, 441 patients undergoing primary repair of superior rotator cuff tears. Multivariate analysis was performed to assess the effect of the inclusion of <b>acromioplasty</b> at the time of rotator cuff repair on visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores and Flex Shoulder Function (Flex SF) scores at 24 -month follow up. RESULTS: On univariate analysis there was a significantly higher Flex SF score in the <b>acromioplasty</b> group (40. 5) compared to the no <b>acromioplasty</b> group (38. 7) and a lower mean pain score at 24 months in the <b>acromioplasty</b> group (1. 44 vs 1. 74). There was a significant difference in tear area and surgical repair technique between the two groups. On multivariate analysis there was no statistically significant difference in Flex SF or VAS pain scores between the two groups. CONCLUSION: There was no difference in pain or function scores at two years following rotator cuff repair {{regardless of whether or not}} <b>acromioplasty</b> was performed. This paper represents the largest study to date comparing <b>acromioplasty</b> to no <b>acromioplasty</b> in the setting of cuff repair. It supports previous literature in showing no significant difference in pain or shoulder function between the two groups...|$|E
30|$|Four studies {{fulfilled}} the inclusion criteria. They reported on 354 patients (mean age, 59  years; range 3 – 81  years) {{with a mean}} follow-up of 22  months (range 12 – 24  months). There were two level-I and two level-II studies. Two studies compared rotator cuff repair with versus without <b>acromioplasty,</b> and two studies compared rotator cuff repair with versus without subacromial decompression (<b>acromioplasty,</b> CA ligament resection, and bursectomy). The procedures were performed arthroscopically, and the CA ligament was released in all four studies. There were {{no statistically significant differences}} in clinical outcomes between patients treated with <b>acromioplasty</b> compared with those treated without <b>acromioplasty.</b>|$|E
30|$|Since {{initially}} presented its successful utilization {{in treating}} chronic impingement syndrome by Neer (1972), open anterior <b>acromioplasty</b> had brought numerous preferable clinical outcomes (McShane et al. 1987; Hawkins et al. 1988; Bigliani et al. 1989). Furthermore, Ellman made arthroscopic <b>acromioplasty</b> popular in 1987 (Ellman 1987). Therefore, <b>acromioplasty</b> has gradually {{become one of}} the most frequently performed orthopaedic procedures over the last few decades (Vitale et al. 2010; Yu et al. 2010). More recently, Paloneva et al. (2015) stated that <b>acromioplasty</b> was the most common concomitant procedure in Finland, performed in nearly 40  % of rotator cuff repairs in 2011. Technically speaking, <b>Acromioplasty</b> is simple and it is often served as a component part of subacromial decompression (SAD), which also contains release of the coracoacromial ligament (CAL) and subacromial bursectomy as well (Ellman 1987).|$|E
30|$|Although Neer [8, 9] {{remarked that}} <b>acromioplasty</b> should be {{reserved}} for “carefully selected patients with mechanical impingement” and proposed that this procedure should be performed only for patients with reasonable life expectancy and persistent disability despite at least 1  year of nonoperative treatment, Vitale et al. [38] showed {{that the incidence of}} <b>acromioplasty</b> has increased dramatically in recent decades. They analyzed the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System ambulatory surgery database from 1996 to 2006 and the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery database from 1999 to 2008 to identify patients who had undergone <b>acromioplasty.</b> They reported a 254  % increase in the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System group versus a 142  % increase in the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery group for the number of acromioplasties over their respective time periods. Yu et al. [39] also evaluated the rising incidence of anterior <b>acromioplasty</b> using medical records of residents in Olmsted County, Minnesota, who underwent isolated <b>acromioplasty</b> between 1980 and 2005. They found a 576  % increase over this time period, further showing the widespread popularity of this procedure. It is likely that because <b>acromioplasty</b> is no longer reimbursed by some insurers in the United States, the incidence of <b>acromioplasty</b> will begin to decrease.|$|E
30|$|The {{benefits}} of <b>acromioplasty</b> in treating rotator cuff disease have been debated. We systematically reviewed the literature regarding whether <b>acromioplasty</b> with concomitant coracoacromial(CA) release {{is necessary for}} the successful treatment of full-thickness rotator cuff tears.|$|E
40|$|<b>Acromioplasty</b> is a well-described {{surgical}} step {{used for}} a variety of rotator cuff pathologies. Although its incidence has increased greatly in last years, its role in rotator cuff surgery has been debated. In this review the recent evidence available at this respect is exposed. There is increasing number of published reports examining the role of <b>acromioplasty</b> in the treatment of rotator cuff disease. Evidence does not support the routine use of <b>acromioplasty</b> in the treatment of the impignement syndrome and rotator cuff repairs, on the basis of multiple well-designed studies suggesting <b>acromioplasty</b> providing no benefits in terms of pain relief, function or quality of life...|$|E
30|$|The {{theory of}} {{extrinsic}} subacromial impingement (Neer 1972), which indirectly suggested that acromial morphology {{was a key}} initiator in rotator cuff tears, shaped {{the rationale for the}} application of concomitant <b>acromioplasty</b> in arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears. Despite the prevalence of this procedure rising substantially {{over the past several decades}} (Vitale et al. 2010; Yu et al. 2010; Paloneva et al. 2015), there is always a controversy surrounding the indeed benefits of <b>acromioplasty</b> in conjunction with rotator cuff repairs. Opponents back up the intrinsic theory that rotator cuff tendons undergo degeneration through aging and overuse (Ozaki et al. 1988; Milgrom et al. 1995; Budoff et al. 1998). Grounding on two RCTs (Gartsman and O’connor 2004; Milano et al. 2007), which were also included in our meta-analysis, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons gave <b>acromioplasty</b> a “moderate” recommendation (Pedowitz et al. 2011), proposing that “routine <b>acromioplasty</b> is not required at the time of rotator cuff repair”. Besides, acromion which was done <b>acromioplasty</b> could be thicker again after several years postoperatively and the effect of subacromial decompression might be gone with the time. Despite the recent evidence that <b>acromioplasty</b> does not improve rotator cuff healing, surgeons still perform <b>acromioplasty,</b> although less aggressively, because it improves visualization during rotator cuff repair in patients with big spurs and stenotic subacromial space.|$|E
30|$|There is an {{increasing}} number of published reports examining the role of <b>acromioplasty</b> with concomitant CA ligament release in the treatment of rotator cuff disease. The current literature suggests that patients have similar outcomes at short-term and intermediate follow-up independent of whether <b>acromioplasty</b> was performed, regardless of acromion morphology. These findings do not support the routine use of <b>acromioplasty</b> as an adjunct to arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. However, current knowledge is limited by the unknown pathophysiology of rotator cuff disease and the inability to know exactly what produces a satisfactory result with rotator cuff surgery. Further study is needed to evaluate the role of <b>acromioplasty</b> and bursectomy alone in the treatment of rotator cuff disease.|$|E
40|$|Anterior <b>acromioplasty</b> as {{described}} by Neer has been an effective procedure for shoulder impingement syn-drome. Recent presentations by Ellman suggest that an effective <b>acromioplasty</b> may be performed arthros-copically. These clinical reports have not been sup-ported by any laboratory experience. The purpose of our {{study was to examine}} the feasibility and attempt to quantitate the results of arthroscopic subacromial de-compressions. Six acromioplasties were performed according to the recommended technique of Dr. Neer to create a stand-ard for comparison. Fourteen fresh postmortem speci-mens were studied. In seven shoulders a standard <b>acromioplasty</b> was performed with an osteotome. In seven shoulders an <b>acromioplasty</b> was performed using standard arthroscopic approaches and motorized in-struments. In five shoulders an isolated division of the coracoacromial ligament was performed arthroscopi-cally. The coracoacromial ligament was completely di-vided in all five cases. In the osteotome group adequate bone was resected in 75 % (21 / 28) measured locations. In the arthroscopic group adequate bone was removed at 86 % (24 / 28) location. This difference is not statisti-cally significant. In the cadaver, anterior <b>acromioplasty</b> was performed effectively and predictably with arthroscopic instru-ments. This compared favorably to a conventional os-teotome <b>acromioplasty.</b> It was concluded that coraco-acromial ligament division can be accomplished...|$|E
30|$|In 2001, Goldberg et al. [20] {{reported}} the first clinical study {{to suggest that}} <b>acromioplasty</b> for full-thickness rotator cuff tears was not necessary for a successful surgical result; this was subsequently confirmed by McAllister et al. [21]. Both studies reported on full-thickness rotator cuff repairs performed without <b>acromioplasty,</b> thus preserving {{the integrity of the}} coracoacromial (CA) arch and the deltoid insertion. They found statistically significant improvements in all clinical outcomes evaluated and advocated abandonment of partial <b>acromioplasty</b> and CA ligament release for the treatment of rotator cuff disease [20, 21].|$|E
30|$|Our {{systematic}} {{review of the}} literature showed no difference in short-term clinical results between patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears who are treated with versus without <b>acromioplasty</b> and CA ligament release. Our results support the findings of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons [36], which gave <b>acromioplasty</b> a “moderate” recommendation for the treatment of rotator cuff disease. On the basis of two studies [30, 32] they suggested that “routine <b>acromioplasty</b> is not required at the time of rotator cuff repair,” and that despite theoretic benefits of <b>acromioplasty</b> in the setting of rotator cuff repair, it has little or no effect on postoperative clinical outcomes. Furthermore, one published {{systematic review}} and meta-analysis of three studies of patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair treated with subacromial decompression found no difference from those treated without subacromial decompression [18].|$|E
30|$|The role of subacromial {{decompression}} {{is still}} controversial. A study by Mole et al. (1992) reported {{a cohort of}} 112 patients with calcifying tendinitis of the rotator cuff treated arthroscopically. They classified their patients into three types according to their radiological appearance, and then treated the patients by excision of the calcium deposit or <b>acromioplasty,</b> or both. They had a satisfactory clinical outcome in 82  % of their patients, yet they found that <b>acromioplasty</b> {{did not have a}} positive effect on the final clinical outcome. Nevertheless, they believed that <b>acromioplasty</b> might be indicated in only type C calcification, without giving any explanation of the reasons behind this belief.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>acromioplasty</b> in long standing rotator cuff deficiency with intractable pain was retrospectively evaluated in a consecutive series of 13 {{patients who were}} followed for a mean period of 19 months (range, 12 to 42 months) after arthroscopic <b>acromioplasty.</b> The Constant score improved from 59. 3 (range, 39. 9 to 90. 3) preoperatively to 98. 7 (69. 1 to 122. 7) postoperatively. Pain and motion improved significantly whereas strength did not improve. Arthroscopic <b>acromioplasty</b> in painful chronic rotator cuff avulsion {{was found to be}} an effective means to control pain and improve motion; it can be recommended when conservative treatment has failed...|$|E
30|$|This {{systematic}} {{review of the}} literature does not support the routine use of partial <b>acromioplasty</b> or CA ligament release in the surgical treatment of rotator cuff disease. In some instances, partial <b>acromioplasty</b> and release of the CA ligament can result in anterior escape and worsening symptoms. Further {{research is needed to determine}} the optimum method for the operative treatment of full-thickness rotator cuff tears.|$|E
30|$|The {{procedure}} of reshaping the acromion with a partial <b>acromioplasty</b> to relieve mechanical {{pressure on the}} rotator cuff was widely adopted in open rotator cuff repair. The ability to perform an arthroscopic partial <b>acromioplasty</b> was first described by Ellman [13] in 1987. The {{risks and benefits of}} open <b>acromioplasty</b> compared with the arthroscopic approach have been identified in a series of studies, as summarized by Spangehl et al. [14]. The major advantage of the open procedure was that it was technically easier to perform and required less surgeon expertise [14]. The advantages of the arthroscopic approach theoretically included improved cosmetic appearance of the surgical scar, preservation of the deltoid muscle, and faster recovery [14].|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The Purpose of this Study was to {{evaluate}} long-term outcomes of arthroscopic <b>acromioplasty</b> for shoulder impingement syndrome. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of 31 shoulders (24 men) that underwent arthroscopic <b>acromioplasty</b> for shoulder impingement syndrome during 1992 and 1993. The mean age at surgery was 49 years (range, 33 to 68 years). A group of 29 shoulders (22 men) operated on consecutively with open <b>acromioplasty</b> from 1985 through 1991 served as controls. The patients were evaluated with the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) score (range, 0 to 35 points) at baseline and at 2 follow-up times performed at {{a mean of}} I and 13 years after surgery, respectively. At the second follow-up, the Disabilities of the Arm. Shoulder and Hand score, the Short Form- 36 bodily pain score, and the EQ- 5 D health utility index also were obtained. Results: After arthroscopic <b>acromioplasty,</b> the mean improvement in UCLA score from baseline to long-term follow-up was 13 points (95 % confidence interval, 11 to 15 points), and the scores indicated an excellent or good result in 77 % of shoulders. The mean UCLA score was 32 points (SD, 5 points) for the patients treated with arthroscopic <b>acromioplasty</b> and 28 points (SD, 8 points) for those treated with open acromioplasty; the mean difference was 4. 3 points (95 % confidence interval, 0. 4 to 8. 2 points P =. 03). In a mixed-model analysis adjusting for age. sex, duration of symptoms, preoperative UCLA score, dominance of operated side. rotator Cuff status at surgery, and time since surgery, {{the rate of change}} from baseline in UCLA score over time was significantly better after arthroscopic surgery than after open Surgery. Conclusions: Good results of arthroscopic <b>acromioplasty</b> were maintained at 12 to 14 years after surgery with excellent or good results shown in 77 % of shoulders, and the long-term outcomes were superior to those after open <b>acromioplasty.</b> Level of Evidence: Level III, therapeutic case-control study...|$|E
30|$|Subsequent studies {{questioned}} {{the role of}} the acromion in the production of rotator cuff disease [15, 16]. Tibone et al. [17] found that partial <b>acromioplasty</b> did not result in improvement of pain in athletic individuals with “impingement.” Published reviews of the efficacy of partial <b>acromioplasty</b> for rotator cuff symptoms found that the results were not as good as expected, with failure rates of 15 – 20  % [18, 19].|$|E
30|$|To {{determine}} {{the benefits of}} concomitant <b>acromioplasty</b> {{in the treatment of}} full-thickness rotator cuff tears, postoperative functional outcome scores are important elements. As different scoring systems might result in variations in the objective assessment, we counted all the available scoring systems. The pooled results found no significant difference in Constant score, UCLA score, VAS in the comparisons. Nevertheless, the correlation between the increased ASES score and concomitant <b>acromioplasty</b> was also observed, and a further TSA result of ASES score suggested insufficient evidence. So, the correlation between the increased ASES score and concomitant <b>acromioplasty</b> could not be absolutely confirmed and more evidence was needed with regard to the result of TSA. In terms of the above inconsistence of various score, we could not draw a definite conclusion on this topic.|$|E

30|$|Nevertheless, the {{benefits}} of <b>acromioplasty</b> in repair of rotator cuff tears remain controversial regarding to its therapeutic value. Several studies presented the association between rotator cuff problem and acromial shape (Bigliani et al. 1991; Balke et al. 2013), and a type- 3 hooked acromion was found vulnerable to rotator cuff disease. Additionally, acromial spurs at the anterior and lateral edges are associated with full-thickness rotator cuff tears (Nyffeler et al. 2006; Ames et al. 2012; Fujisawa et al. 2014). Under Neer’s extrinsic theory, <b>acromioplasty</b> was advocated to modify acromial morphology, reducing extrinsic compression on the rotator cuff (Neer 1972), improving arthroscopic visualization during rotator cuff repair (Shi and Edwards 2012; Frank et al. 2014), and inducing a healing response through bleeding bone in the subacromial space (Neer 1972; Randelli et al. 2009; Shi and Edwards 2012). However, proponents of the intrinsic theory argued against <b>acromioplasty</b> for preservation of the CAL and deltoid attachment, the economics of saved operative time and equipment, and the neurobiology of subacromial space (Shi and Edwards 2012).Two studies (Goldberg et al. 2001; Matsen 2009) consecutively substantiated that <b>acromioplasty</b> was not necessary for successful repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears. Thus, the debate was more urgent to be settled.|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} meta-analysis, we {{conducted}} a thorough quantitative analysis of the available level I and level II evidence to identify the additional value of performing an <b>acromioplasty</b> during arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs. In general, our findings {{were in accordance with}} the aforementioned recommendation. There {{was no significant difference in}} Constant score, UCLA score, VAS and the re-tear rate in individuals treated with or without concomitant <b>acromioplasty.</b> With regards to functional score, Constant score weigh much on muscle power, and UCLA score is well known as not reliable functional evaluation tool in many reports. Subgroup analysis also found no significant effect of acromial type on ASES score. But notably, a statistically significant difference was found in data synthesis of ASES score (P =  0.03), indicating concomitant <b>acromioplasty</b> was associated with a higher score in this domain. Nevertheless, the TSA result of ASES score suggested insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion.|$|E
