5000|$|I teach {{an adult}} Sunday school class, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> is {{that half of}} the people in my class are still {{struggling}} to understand the Bible well enough to apply its wisdom to [...] "every decision" [...] they make. The point is that some of these [...] "Bible-believing" [...] standards are ridiculous when you consider how they're applied to kids.|$|E
5000|$|On January 12, 1975, Agee {{testified before}} the second Bertrand Russell Tribunal in Brussels that in 1960 he had {{conducted}} personal name-checks of Venezuelan employees for a Venezuelan subsidiary {{of what is now}} Exxon. Exxon was [...] "letting the CIA assist in employment decisions, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> is that those name checks...are continuing to this day". Agee stated that the CIA customarily performed this service for subsidiaries of large U.S. corporations throughout Latin America. An Exxon spokesman denied Agee's accusations.|$|E

60|$|Guess again. Perhaps it {{was there}} always, from the {{beginning}} of the world? My dear child, you have no proof of that either. Everything round you is changing in shape daily and hourly, as you will find out the longer you live; and therefore it is most reasonable to suppose that this glen has changed its shape, as everything else on earth has done. Besides, I told you not that Madam How had made the glen, but that she was making it, and as yet has only half finished. That is <b>my</b> first guess; <b>and</b> <b>my</b> next <b>guess</b> is that water is making the glen--water, and nothing else.|$|R
40|$|PHYSICAL THERAPY. This was an excel-lent article {{describing}} a common prob-lem that {{has rarely been}} evaluated closely. Like the author, I am a former ballet dancer and teacher. Everything in ballet is done with the feet plantar flexed, which promotes stretching of the tibialis anterior muscle. There are no dance moves or warm-up exercises, however, routinely given to strengthen the mus-cle. The tibialis anterior muscle {{may in fact be}} weak. This factor needs further investigation <b>and</b> study, but <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> would be that this combination of fac-tors causes the many cases of shin splints in ballet dancers...|$|R

The working relationship between the two is extraordinary <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> is there aren’t many in the world that are like that. We don’t have the sorts of conflicts you see between leagues and federations - that’s a plus.” ...|$|E
40|$|Opinions {{about the}} {{importance}} of social learning of information or inno- vations among animals in nature vary dramatically. Dugatkin (2000, p. 200) sees culture everywhere: “The vast array of animal behaviors that are touched by the long fingers of culture continues to grow, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> is that we have seen only the tip of the iceberg,” and “cultural transmission and gene/culture interactions are serious, underestimated forces in evolu- tionary biology” (ibid., p. 28). De Waal (2001, p. 363) agrees: “The world is chock-full of feathered and furry animals that learn their life’s lessons, habits, and songs from one another. ” Others are not convinced, arguing that social learning is invoked spuriously to explain patterns in nature, in particular among great apes and cetaceans, that are explained more parsi- moniously by using developmental models that assume individual acquisi- tion of behavior patterns often attributed to culture (Galef 1992, 2003 a Heyes 1993; Tomasello 1994; Laland and Hoppitt 2003; Laland and Janik 2006) ...|$|E
40|$|We are at one {{of those}} moments in the course of human events when a number of {{bounding}} technologies are coming together – computers and computing, including mobile computing, neuroscience, biometrics and sensors. When I say computers and computing, I mean the com-putational capabilities of the machines, the computations that make the machines useful as well as advances in networking such as increasing available bandwidth and decreasing bandwidth requirements. In addition, {{since the end of the}} Cold War, there have been heartening develop-ments in analysis of the concept of deterrence. Deterrence, I suspect, is at least a million years old. When, for the first time, a primitive human raised a club toward another but did not use it, he made a deterrent calcula-tion that was at once simple and complex: “I would not want my skull bashed in with this thing <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> is that you would not want that either. ” He could see in his opponent’s reaction whether deterrence was working. There was no effete analysis. He had the capability and demonstrated will and he was thoroughly prepared for deterrence to fail. If, for whatever reason, his opponent persisted, he would use the club to bash his brains out. And anyone within earshot would take heed. Modern ana-lysts take notice. It probably went something quite like that, although we have no evidence of it. However, we do begin to have written records of deterrence, successful and unsuccess-ful, with Thucydides, 2, 400 years ago. By the time of th...|$|E
60|$|I {{was once}} Adam Strang, an Englishman. The period of my living, {{as near as}} I can guess it, was somewhere between 1550 and 1650, and I lived to a ripe old age, as you shall see. It {{has been a great}} regret to me, ever since Ed Morrell taught me the way of the little death, that I had not been a more {{thorough}} student of history.

50|$|The first France Test at Ballymore held special {{significance}} {{for me because}} I was playing alongside Loaney for the first time. In my eyes he {{was something of a}} god, <b>and</b> I <b>guess</b> <b>my</b> feeling was the same as a young actor getting a bit part in a movie with Dustin Hoffman. Loaney was a huge inspiration, and I tailed him around the field hoping to feed off him whenever he made one of those titanic bursts where he’d split the defence wide open with his unbelievable strength and speed.|$|R

He has written a network television theme song, a Presidential campaign song, a national sports anthem, show tunes, gospel songs, comic numbers and a Billboard Country Single of the Year.

In 1991 {{he was diagnosed with}} AIDS and reluctantly returned to London for treatment. He went blind the following year. With equipment supplied by the RNIB, he was able to carry on writing, and in June 1992, he wrote an article on his condition for Gay Times, 'Descent Into Darkness'; becoming {{one of the first people}} with AIDS to come out publicly. [...] "As long as I have my friends, my family, my fags, my coffee, <b>my</b> opera tapes <b>and</b> <b>my</b> writing I <b>guess</b> I shall tootle along, even though I may not have all my coat buttons done up properly.

60|$|By and by, {{in the bed}} of {{a shallow}} rivulet, I found a deposit of shining yellow scales, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> breath almost forsook me! A gold mine, <b>and</b> in <b>my</b> {{simplicity}} I had been content with vulgar silver! I was so excited that I half believed my overwrought imagination was deceiving me. Then a fear came upon me that people might be observing me <b>and</b> would <b>guess</b> <b>my</b> secret. Moved by this thought, I made a circuit of the place, and ascended a knoll to reconnoiter. Solitude. No creature was near. Then I returned to my mine, fortifying myself against possible disappointment, but my fears were groundless--the shining scales were still there. I set about scooping them out, and for an hour I toiled down the windings of the stream and robbed its bed. But at last the descending sun warned me to give up the quest, and I turned homeward laden with wealth. As I walked along I could not help smiling at the thought of my being so excited over my fragment of silver when a nobler metal was almost under my nose. In this little time the former had so fallen in my estimation that once or twice I was on the point of throwing it away.|$|R
