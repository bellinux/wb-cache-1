30|$|An {{entrepreneur}} is {{an individual}} who establishes and manages a business enterprise. Dhenak (2010) defined an entrepreneur {{as a person who}} starts an enterprise. Chasserio et al. (2014) stated that an entrepreneur takes on different social roles and is constituted by several social identities. Torre (2015 a) defined entrepreneur in three ways; a starter, a driver, <b>and</b> being <b>accountable</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsible.</b> As a starter, an entrepreneur is an initiator, a challenger and a driver. An entrepreneur is someone that creates something new, an initiative, a business or a company. As a driver, an entrepreneur is the person in charge, the leader and the person to look to for leadership. In terms of being <b>accountable</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsible,</b> the entrepreneur is responsible for the destiny of the business venture, which can be a company, a project, or any other endeavour Torre (2015 b). The forces which drive an individual to become an entrepreneur may be the desire to acquire wealth, create job opportunities, and earn a living, among others, which can be regarded as an individual’s Entrepreneurial Outcome Expectation (EOE). An entrepreneur is a person who takes risks and bears responsibility for every action. The propensity to take risks by an entrepreneur is referred to in this study as Risk Taking Propensity Factor (RTPF). Risk Taking Propensity Factor (RTPF) is the willingness to take calculated risks associated with a business enterprise (Boyd & Vozikis, 1994). Therefore, an entrepreneur {{is an individual}} who has the desire to establish a business venture in order to be financially independent. The entrepreneurship intention of an individual motivates the individual in establishing an enterprise.|$|R

40|$|People are {{different}} {{because of their}} genetic make-up. These differences {{are made up of}} variations in proteins inherited from their parental genes or developed through mutations. If these differences occur in the enzymes (cytochromes P 450) associated with drug absorption, metabolism and elimination, the person may eliminate the drug very quickly from the body, reducing its potency and requiring larger doses for therapeutic effect. Conversely, the drug may become more potent, requiring smaller doses to avoid side-effects. Presently, many drugs are prescribed first and their levels adjusted later following assessment of their blood levels—which may take several days. Pharmacogenomics, a science which explores people’s drug response based on their genetic make-up and lifestyle, offers clinical tests, some which may be performed in the surgery, to identify many of the differences in a person’s cytochrome P 450 enzymes, so that the correct drug, amount and frequency may be prescribed from the start for maximum beneficial effects with minimum side-effects. Pharmacodynamics offers nurses an advanced theoretical and clinical understanding of these variations, the effect these may have on drug absorption, therapeutic effects and elimination process. Such knowledge empowers nurses and midwives to become more <b>accountable</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsible,</b> <b>and</b> ensure their patients/clients receive the correct drug, amount and frequency, as prescribed by the NMC...|$|R

40|$|The systems {{engineering}} of space missions to study planet Earth {{has been an}} important focus of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) since its inception. But all space missions are becoming increasingly complex and this fact, reinforced by some major mishaps, has caused NASA to reevaluate their approach to achieving safety and mission success. A new approach ensures that there are adequate checks and balances in place to maximize the probability of safety and mission success. To this end the agency created the concept of Technical Authority which identifies a key individual <b>accountable</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsible</b> for the technical integrity of a flight mission as well as a project-independent reporting path. At the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) this responsibility ultimately begins with the Mission Systems Engineer (MSE) for each satellite mission.

The resulting ‘social licence’ established by company and financial law and regulation aimed {{to balance the}} granted privileges of limited liability and share transferability with the corporate social contribution to economic development and employment. Recent transformations driven by shareholder value and financialisation have been challenging this balance of interests between stakeholders (including employees and shareholders) and society.

40|$|This paper extends {{research}} on the giving and inheriting of digital artifacts by examining social network site accounts post-mortem. Given the important role that social network sites play in online bereavement practices, we {{conducted a series of}} in-depth qualitative interviews to explore issues around inheritance and post-mortem data management of Facebook accounts. We found that participants focused less on ownership of the data, and instead on the duties and potential conflicts associated with maintaining an account post-mortem. Subsequently, we argue for “stewardship ” as an alternative to inheritance for framing post-mortem data management practices. Analysis of post-mortem data management activities highlights how stewards are <b>accountable</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsible</b> to the deceased and various survivors. However, weighing competing responsibilities is complicated by varied relationships with disparate survivors, as well as the inability to consult with the deceased. Based on our findings, we claim that post-mortem solutions need to account for the needs of stewards in addition to those of the deceased and survivors. We suggest that a model of stewardship better accounts for the interpersonal responsibilities that accompany online data than inheritance alone.

40|$|The Right to Information Act {{was enacted}} in 2005 in India in {{response}} to citizens’ demand for access to information and keenness to stem corruption in the public sphere. Freedom of information is a recognised fundamental human right. There is a strong relationship between access to relevant information and people’s realisation of socio-economic rights. Despite the emphasis of a rights-based approach to development, often the poor and marginalised have little say in the development process. India, which has been heavily dependent on foreign aid for development since independence in 1947, is now an aid-giver while also being an aid recipient.

40|$|Conventional {{rehabilitation}} {{for people}} with physical difficulties is based on mostly a biomedical approach to health focusing on isolated {{parts of the body}} without recognizing the patients’ other needs. While more holistic and bio-psycho-social rehabilitation models have been developed, these are generally not recognized and as a result multiple needs are unlikely to be addressed. This qualitative investigation of a rehabilitation in group setting explored the experience and impact of Conductive Education and draws on a complex, person centered, bio-psycho-social rehabilitation method. The research explores physically disabled adult patients’, family members’ and CE professionals’ constructs on group setting in CE with the aim of finding out more about the approach itself and its delivery. Results suggest that CE does not decrease the exceptional result of physical rehabilitation of adult patients but conducts new motivational and developmental factors and broadens elements of rehabilitation in a complex way - holistically providing a life-changing concept. The study concludes with the recommendation for health care providers, rehabilitation institutions, <b>accountable</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsible</b> bodies to introduce and use group setting method in the rehabilitation of adult physical disabled. Furthermore, it is stated that considerably more and adequate investigation need to be done on CE to better understand its complex offer...|$|R

Organizations tend to underutilize their employees during times of change.

As a manager and an instructor of management, I believe that is the employee that essentially controls {{the success of any}} change in an organization. Employees should be charged with the ability to foster positive change by management, but more so, by themselves. It is the employees responsibility to make the change work in the organization, along with making changes in themselves to help improve not only the organization, but to improve their own working behaviors. All employers should be creating a learning organization by asking their employees to become responsible members of the organization. Allow your staff to be present at the table.

The issues which are confronted under the concept of relevance in anthropology would be perhaps more correctly labeled 2 ̆ 2 responsibility in anthropology 2 ̆ 2. Relevance is defined as pertinence and, social applicability, in other words, the ability, to satisfy a need. The concept of responsibility encompasses this social applicability but also includes moral and rational accountability for one 2 ̆ 7 s conduct and obligations. Not only is it the ability to satisfy a need but the accountability for the actions taken to satisfy the need and the repercussions which follow. Just as {{it is true that}} each anthropologist must reinvent anthropology for himself or herself, each anthropologist must be held <b>accountable</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsible</b> for his or her research.
