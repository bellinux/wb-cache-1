5|$|His writing {{style is}} best {{described}} as equal parts anger, confidence, and pageantry. Scalia has <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> for garish analogies and offbeat allusions—often very funny ones—and he speaks in no uncertain terms. He is highly accessible and tries not to get bogged down in abstruse legal jargon. But most of all, Scalia's opinions read like they're about to catch fire for pure outrage. He does not, in short, write like a happy man.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, Billy Butlin {{was living}} in Toronto {{with his mother and}} stepfather, when he left school and went to work for Eatons {{department}} store.

5|$|In 2006, Tecmo and Sony {{announced}} {{the development of}} Ninja Gaiden Sigma for the PS3. Eidos obtained the European publishing rights for this game. Itagaki had no direct role in Sigma and judged it a flawed game, although he acknowledged that Sigma gave PlayStation owners <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> of Ninja Gaiden. A version for PlayStation Vita, titled Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus, was released in North America and Europe on February 22, 2012.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1920, Guinness {{export sales}} were mostly to ethnic Anglo Saxons and Celts. From the 1920s onwards this changed, {{and among the}} first natives to develop <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> for the drink were the ethnic Chinese of the Malay Peninsula. In 1924, a global Guinness {{salesman}} was appointed by the company, and sales began to be pursued among native populations.|$|E
5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>tasting</b> menu is <b>a</b> {{collection}} of small portions of several dishes {{served by a}} restaurant as a single meal. The French name for <b>a</b> <b>tasting</b> menu is menu dégustation. Some restaurants and chefs specialize in tasting menus, while in other cases, it is a special or a menu option. Tasting menus may be offered to provide a sample of a type of cuisine, or house specialties, or {{to take advantage of}} fresh seasonal ingredients.|$|R
5|$|Trollope {{expected}} his {{depiction of}} a fallen woman to be controversial, and unusually for him wrote a preface defending it. But the anticipated controversy never materialised, and contemporary reviewers tended to ignore that subplot, focussing instead on the courtship in the novel. Reviews were generally less than positive; many reviewers and readers who had acquired <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> for Trollope from the 1850s60s Barchester novels were unhappy about the darker tone of later novels such as this one.|$|E
5|$|When the {{day comes}} for Homer to take Bart and Lisa to Duff Gardens, he falls ill from food {{poisoning}} after eating a hoagie that became spoiled days, if not {{weeks after he}} took it home from a company picnic.

5|$|Another failed product, {{this time}} under Grand Metropolitan's {{successor}} Diageo, was the BK Back Porch Grillers line of burgers that featured a spiced and flavored patty {{served on a}} bakery-style roll. There were two varieties: The Regular served with mayonnaise, whole leaf iceberg lettuce, tomato and grilled onions, and the Bacon Cheddar, with bacon and smoked cheddar cheese. There was one LTO variety, the Black Stack Griller, made with Black Strap Barbecue sauce (a strong molasses-flavored sauce), Swiss cheese, bacon, and onions, to promote Men in Black II. The Griller patty was flavored so that it had <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> similar to a hamburger that had been grilled over a charcoal-fired grill.|$|E
5000|$|For the 2007 vintage, about 20% of {{the grapes}} {{used by the}} winery were estate-grown, {{including}} all the fruit for The Spaniard and Torcido label wines, with the rest purchased from other vineyards. <b>A</b> <b>tasting</b> room at the winery {{is open to the}} public daily, and <b>a</b> <b>tasting</b> room on Main Street in downtown Murphys is open year round.

5|$|Another {{similarly}} colored Russula is R.nigricans, {{which can}} be distinguished from R.densifolia by its darker cap and widely spaced gills. Another lookalike, R.dissimulans, has a dry cap surface, and a mild taste. R.albonigra stains directly to black when injured, and has <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> reminiscent of menthol. R.densifolia is often confused with R.acrifolia, but the latter's gills do not change color when bruised. R.adusta, found with conifers, has a less acrid taste, and its cut flesh changes to light pink rather than red.|$|E
5|$|As a self-taught {{composer}} and performer, Zappa's diverse musical influences {{led him to}} create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize. While in his teens, he acquired <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> for 20th-century classical composers such as Edgard Varèse, Igor Stravinsky, and Anton Webern, along with 1950s rhythm and blues and doo-wop music. He began writing classical music in high school, {{while at the same}} time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands; later switching to electric guitar. His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention, Freak Out!, combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages. He continued this eclectic and experimental approach, irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz or classical.|$|E
5|$|As {{the colonists}} fenced off more land, the Noongar were {{increasingly}} {{denied access to}} their traditional hunting grounds and sacred sites. In search of food, the Noongar raided the settlers' crops and killed their cattle. They also developed <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> for the settlers' supplies, and began to take flour and other food, which became a serious problem for the colony. In addition, the Noongar practice of firestick farming: firing the bush to flush out game and encourage germination of undergrowth for sustainability, threatened the settlers' crops and houses.|$|E

5|$|Both {{families}} were largely Unitarian, though the Wedgwoods were adopting Anglicanism. Robert Darwin, himself quietly a freethinker, had baby Charles baptised in November 1809 in the Anglican St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury, but Charles and his siblings attended the Unitarian chapel with their mother. The eight-year-old Charles already had <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> for {{natural history and}} collecting {{when he joined the}} day school run by its preacher in 1817. That July, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother Erasmus attending the nearby Anglican Shrewsbury School as a boarder.|$|E
5|$|Haleem {{originated}} as an Arabic {{dish with}} meat and pounded wheat {{as the chief}} ingredients. It was introduced to Hyderabad by the Arab diaspora during {{the rule of the}} sixth Nizam, Mahbub Ali Khan, and later became an integral part of Hyderabadi cuisine during the rule of the seventh Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan. Sultan Saif Nawaz Jung Bahadur, an Arab chief from Mukalla, Hadhramaut, Yemen, who was among the seventh Nizam's court nobility, popularised it in Hyderabad. Addition of local flavours to the original recipe resulted in <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> distinct from other types of haleem.|$|E
5|$|Jacobson's case {{attracted}} {{some national}} media attention. Civil liberties advocates supported him, worried {{over what they}} saw as dangerous growth in government police powers during the Reagan and Bush administrations, when law enforcement were alleged to have cracked down on drugs as well as pornography distribution {{at the behest of the}} Religious Right. Operation Looking Glass, the USPS claimed, had netted 147 convictions, but only 35 where evidence was found that the offenders had either been involved in producing child pornography or molested children. Critics claimed that the government was exaggerating the child-porn problem at best and contributing to it at worst, possibly by introducing some consumers to material they might never have developed <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> for otherwise.|$|E
