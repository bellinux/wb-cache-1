In each sub-experiment one of the constructs was replaced by several represented attributes. In this paper, results of {{a small sample of}} <b>commuters</b> <b>and</b> <b>students</b> are reported.

40|$|University <b>commuter</b> <b>and</b> {{resident}} <b>students</b> {{were compared}} {{in terms of}} level of academic engagement, social engagement, and satisfaction. The participants were 311 undergraduates at a large university in Ontario. The findings revealed that levels of academic engagement {{did not differ significantly}} between <b>commuters</b> <b>and</b> residents, but the two groups differed significantly in terms of social engagement and satisfaction, with residents exhibiting higher levels of both than commuters. The findings indicated that the family home environment is not an impediment to academic engagement, and that there is not one model of preference for students regarding housing. Investigating the characteristics of <b>commuter</b> <b>and</b> resident <b>students</b> is warranted, including expectations regarding academic and social activities. Having a better understanding of why students are making their choice regarding housing, combined with research on how the residence environment impacts these <b>and</b> other <b>student</b> outcomes, would empower the PSE sector to better serve both populations...|$|R

40|$|Similar to vehicle traffic, {{pedestrian}} flow {{can also}} be classified as heterogeneous. This paper introduces the concept of equivalent factors for converting mixed older <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> <b>commuter</b> pedestrian flow into equivalent commuter flow. The methodology employed was derived from vehicle passenger car equivalent (PCE) methodologies. Pedestrian micro-simulation models are utilized to generate data for the pedestrian time-space (TS) -flow relations where flow equivalency is derived. Data for the model input and calibration and validation were collected for commuter-only traffic <b>and</b> older <b>adult</b> <b>and</b> <b>commuter</b> combination. Results from the model were used to create the TS-flow relationship and pedestrian equivalent factors calculated. An application of the equivalent factor illustrates the importance of considering heterogeneity in pedestrian walkway design. This methodology can be adopted to compute other equivalent factors for other pedestrian types considering local pedestrian characteristics...|$|R

50|$|The Voice of Montclair State {{was founded}} with {{the vision of}} {{becoming}} another way for student outreach to Montclair State <b>students</b> <b>and</b> the communities surrounding the college. MSC was primarily a commuter college with on-campus housing for only about 25% of its 1966 student population. Most of the <b>commuters</b> <b>and</b> off-campus housing <b>students</b> left the campus {{at the end of}} their classes and seldom returned to participate in the wide variety of campus activities available. A commuter student from Clifton, New Jersey, Ed Helvey, felt that a college-based FM radio station could help better connect the <b>commuter</b> <b>and</b> off-campus <b>students</b> with their campus. Mr. Helvey's interest in broadcast communications began as a young teenager when he became a licensed amateur radio operator. In his freshman year, he founded the Montclair State Amateur Radio Society and then, during his sophomore year, began a campaign to build interest in creating a college broadcast radio station.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Regular cycling {{has been}} shown to improve health and has a role in {{tackling}} the threats posed by obesity and inactivity. Cycle collisions, particularly those involving motorised vehicles, can lead to significant mortality and morbidity and are currently a barrier to wider uptake of cycling. There is evidence that the conspicuity of cyclists is a factor in many injury collisions. Low-cost, easy to use retro-reflective and fluorescent clothing and accessories ('conspicuity aids') are available. Their effectiveness in reducing cycling collisions is unknown. The study is designed to investigate the relationship between the use of conspicuity aids and risk of collision or evasion crashes for utility <b>and</b> <b>commuter</b> cyclists in the UK. Methods/Design A matched case-control study is proposed. Cases are <b>adult</b> <b>commuter</b> <b>and</b> utility cyclists involved in a crash resulting from a collision or attempted evasion of a collision with another road user recruited at a UK emergency department. Controls are <b>commuter</b> <b>and</b> utility cyclists matched by journey purpose, time and day of travel and geographical area recruited at public and private cycle parking sites. Data on the use of conspicuity aids, crash circumstances, demographics, cycling experience, safety equipment use, journey characteristics and route will be collected using self-completed questionnaires and maps. Conditional logistic regression will be used to calculate adjusted odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals of the risk of a crash when using any item of fluorescent or reflective clothing or equipment. Discussion This study will provide information on the effectiveness of conspicuity aids in reducing the risk of injury to cyclists resulting from crashes involving other road users. </p...|$|R
50|$|Recent {{growth in}} the highway system and {{increased}} competition from bus companies and airlines {{has led to a}} decline in long-distance rail travel (except during major holidays such as Chinese New Year), though short and intermediate distance travel is still heavily utilized by <b>commuters</b> <b>and</b> <b>students.</b> The high-speed rail line is not run by TRA, and is also a major source of competition. To offset this TRA has begun placing an emphasis on tourism <b>and</b> short-distance <b>commuter</b> service. This has led to several special tourist trains running to scenic areas and hot springs, the addition of dining cars (originally deemed unnecessary due to Taiwan's relatively small size), and converting several smaller branch lines to attract tourists. Additionally, several new stations have been added in major metropolitan areas, <b>and</b> local <b>commuter</b> service increased.
