Objective: To quantify airborne and settled dust Mus m 1 levels in homes of inner-city patients with asthma and to identify risk factors for mouse allergen exposure. Methods: One hundred inner-city school-age children with asthma in Baltimore underwent skin testing to a panel of aeroallergens, and their homes were inspected by a trained technician. Air and settled dust were sampled in the child’s bedroom. Mus m 1, particulate matter smaller than 10 microns (PM 10), and particulate matter smaller than 2. 5 microns were quantified in air samples, and Mus m 1 was quantified in settled dust samples. Results: Mus m 1 was detected in settled dust samples from 100 % of bedrooms. <b>Airborne</b> mouse <b>allergen</b> was detected in 48 of 57 (84 %) bedrooms, and the median <b>airborne</b> mouse <b>allergen</b> concentration was 0. 03 ng/m 3.

Basophil activation was tested in an Fc 3 R 1 -humanized rat basophil cell line passively sensitized with serum of a birch pollen symptomatic patient. Compared to 10 previous years, 2009 was a representative birch pollen season for all stations. About 90 % of the allergen {{was found in the}} PM > 10 mm fraction at all stations. Bet v 1 isoforms pattern did not vary substantially neither during ripening of pollen nor between different geographical locations. The average European allergen release from birch pollen was 3. 2 pg Bet v 1 /pollen and did not vary much between the European countries. However, in all countries a > 10 -fold difference in daily allergen release per pollen was measured which could be explained by long-range transport of pollen with a deviating allergen release.

50|$|In 1952 basidiospores were {{described}} as being possible <b>airborne</b> <b>allergens</b> and were linked to asthma in 1969. Basidiospores are the dominant airborne fungal allergens. Fungal allergies are associated with seasonal asthma. They {{are considered to be}} a major source of <b>airborne</b> <b>allergens.</b> The basidospore family include mushrooms, rusts, smuts, brackets, and puffballs. The airborne spores from mushrooms reach levels comparable to those of mold and pollens. The levels of mushroom respiratory allergy are as high as 30 percent of those with allergic disorder, but it is believed to be less than 1 percent of food allergies. Heavy rainfall (which increases fungal spore release) is associated with increased hospital admissions of children with asthma. A study in New Zealand found that 22 percent of patients with respiratory allergic disorders tested positive for basidiospores allergies. Mushroom spore allergies can cause either immediate allergic symptomatology or delayed allergic reactions. Those with asthma {{are more likely to have}} immediate allergic reactions and those with allergic rhinitis are more likely to have delayed allergic responses. A study found that 27 percent of patients were allergic to basidiomycete mycelia extracts and 32 percent were allergic to basidiospore extracts, thus demonstrating the high incidence of fungal sensitisation in individuals with suspected allergies. It has been found that of basidiomycete cap, mycelia, and spore extracts that spore extracts are the most reliable extract for diagnosing basidiomycete allergy.|$|E

Recently, a new sampling medium, porous polyurethane foam, has been introduced for the size-selective sampling of airborne dust in various occupational settings. We investigated the applicability of these foams for size-selective wheat allergen measurements. Methods: Personal and stationary measurements were performed in a flour mill, using respirable and thoracic foams inserted into the conventional IOM inhalable sampler, together with PTFE (Teflon) filters. Foams and filters were eluted and wheat allergen levels determined by human IgG 4 inhibition EIA. Results: Wheat allergen levels could be determined in both filter and foam eluates. Inhalable dust levels from filters and foams ranged from 1. 4 to 53 mg m- 3, and wheat allergen levels from 15 to 580 μg m- 3. The allergen was mainly borne on particles with Dae (particle aerodynamic diameter) > 10 μm and particles with 4 μm > Dae ≤ 10 μm, accounting for 54. 5 - 77. 5 % and 18. 9 - 43. 2 % of the total allergen yield, respectively. Less than 4 % of <b>airborne</b> wheat <b>allergen</b> was carried by particles smaller than 4 μm (respirable fraction). Conclusions: Measurement of wheat allergen in dust fractions trapped in respirable and thoracic foams is technically feasible.

50|$|Persons with allergy are {{sensitized}} to make {{immune response}} to several or many proteins contained {{in one or}} more of the hundreds of harmless environmental substances, which they take in by inhalation (e.g., house dust mites, pollens, molds, pet animal dander, and other <b>airborne</b> <b>allergens)</b> and ingestion (e.g., wheat (gluten), peanuts, nuts, shellfish, and other food allergens), or through the skin (e.g., bee and fire ant stings, latex gloves). In these individuals, the IgE molecules, both allergen-specific and allergen-nonspecific ones, in their bodies bind to the high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) on the surface of mast cells and basophils. Under certain conditions, including but not limited to when the allergenic substances are taken in by a sensitized individual at substantial amounts, the allergenic proteins bind to the allergen-specific IgE bound by FcεRI on the surface of mast cells and basophils and trigger the activation of those inflammatory cells, which release a host of pharmacological mediators, such as histamine, leukotrienes, tryptase, inflammatory cytokines, and others, causing various allergic symptoms/diseases.|$|E
50|$|The {{inflammation}} {{is caused}} by viruses, bacteria, irritants or allergens. The most common kind of rhinitis is allergic rhinitis, which is usually triggered by <b>airborne</b> <b>allergens</b> such as pollen and dander. Allergic rhinitis may cause additional symptoms, such as sneezing and nasal itching, coughing, headache, fatigue, malaise, and cognitive impairment. The allergens may also affect the eyes, causing watery, reddened, or itchy eyes and puffiness around the eyes. The inflammation results in the generation of large amounts of mucus, commonly producing a runny nose, {{as well as a}} stuffy nose and post-nasal drip. In the case of allergic rhinitis, the inflammation {{is caused by}} the degranulation of mast cells in the nose. When mast cells degranulate, they release histamine and other chemicals, starting an inflammatory process that can cause symptoms outside the nose, such as fatigue and malaise. In the case of infectious rhinitis, it may occasionally lead to pneumonia, either viral or bacterial. Sneezing also occurs in infectious rhinitis to expel bacteria and viruses from the respiratory system.|$|E

40|$|Pollen grains only {{represent}} {{a small fraction}} of the total amount of the viable biological particles present in the air, but pollen are the most important aeroallergens in the outdoor environment. The analysis of pollen has traditionally been carried out by microscopy, which can be traced back to the 17 th century. Modern advances in molecular analysis could improve information for allergy sufferers and health care professionals. Pollen allergy (pollinosis) was first described in the 19 th century. The prevalence of respiratory diseases increased dramatically during the latter part of the 20 th century and millions of individuals are now affected. A number of scientists devised equipment to examine airborne biological particles during the 19 th century, but aerobiological monitoring only became standardized during the 20 th century. Airborne pollen are routinely monitored in many parts of the world, such as North America and Europe, and the first limited network has also been created for monitoring <b>airborne</b> <b>allergen</b> concentrations. Monitoring of the environment is often based on a combination of measurements and model results. Source-based models can increase our knowledge of airborne pollen because they can explain situations and processes that are almost impossible to understand using observations alone...|$|R
40|$|Allergic asthma is {{a chronic}} disease {{characterized}} by airway obstruction {{in response to}} allergen exposure. It results from an inappropriate T helper type 2 response to environmental airborne antigens and affects 300 million individuals. Its prevalence has increased markedly in recent decades, most probably {{as a result of}} changes in environmental factors. Exposure to environmental antigens during infancy is crucial to the development of asthma. Epidemiological studies on the relationship between breastfeeding and allergic diseases have reached conflicting results. Here, we have investigated whether the exposure of lactating mice to an <b>airborne</b> <b>allergen</b> affects asthma development in progeny. We found that airborne antigens were efficiently transferred from the mother to the neonate through milk and that tolerance induction did not require the transfer of immunoglobulins. Breastfeeding-induced tolerance relied on the presence of transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta during lactation, was mediated by regulatory CD 4 + T lymphocytes and depended on TGF-beta signaling in T cells. In conclusion, breast milk-mediated transfer of an antigen to the neonate resulted in oral tolerance induction leading to antigen-specific protection from allergic airway disease. This study may pave the way for the design of new strategies to prevent the development of allergic diseases...|$|R

The roles of B cells in allergic airway inflammation and asthma have been controversial. We examined the functional importance of B cells in a mouse model of asthma, in which mice were exposed repeatedly to common <b>airborne</b> <b>allergens.</b> Naïve wild-type BALB/c mice or B cell-deficient JH-/- mice were exposed intranasally to a cocktail of allergen extracts, including Alternaria, Aspergillus, and house dust mite, {{every other day}} for two weeks. Ovalbumin {{was included in the}} cocktail to monitor the T cell immune response. Airway inflammation, lung pathology, and airway reactivity were analyzed. The airway exposure of naïve wild type mice to <b>airborne</b> <b>allergens</b> induced robust eosinophilic airway inflammation, increased the levels of Th 2 cytokines and chemokines in the lung, and increased the reactivity to inhaled methacholine. These pathological changes and immune responses were attenuated in B cell-deficient JH-/- mice. The allergen-induced expansion of CD 4 + T cells was impaired in the lungs and draining lymph nodes of JH-/- mice. Furthermore, lymphocytes from JH-/- mice failed to produce Th 2 cytokines in response to ovalbumin re-stimulation in vitro.

40|$|Epithelial {{cells of}} both the {{respiratory}} tract and the skin form a tight barrier against environmental harm. They represent the site of first contact for <b>airborne</b> <b>allergen</b> carriers. Consequently, in this study, we analyzed the uptake of grass pollen allergens by epithelial cells: Phl p 1 was selected as a glycosylated allergen containing disulfide bridges whereas Phl p 6 lacks post-translational modifications. Allergen uptake by the respiratory epithelial cell line A 549 reached a plateau at 2 hours, and both allergens were localized intracellularly in non-acidic vesicles. In addition, in A 549 cells allergens were exocytosed, suggesting a transcytosis mechanism in the passage of allergens over the respiratory epithelial barrier. In contrast, allergens were predominately localized in lysosomes in keratinocytes, and allergen uptake did not reach a plateau up to 24 hours. Notably, keratinocytes from atopic patients showed a significantly increased uptake of Phl p 1 as compared with healthy donors. Preincubation of epithelial cells with IL- 4 and/or IFN-γ to simulate inflammatory status led to an increased allergen uptake only in keratinocytes. This higher engulfment of allergens by inflammatory-type keratinocytes suggests a higher susceptibility of inflamed skin for the uptake of allergens and consequently a potentially higher risk for sensitization under natural exposure conditions, such as chronic atopic eczema...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{bronchial}} asthma, {{a clinical}} complication of persistent {{inflammation of the}} airway and subsequent airway hyper-responsiveness, is {{a leading cause of}} morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Several studies have shown that oxidative stress {{plays a key role in}} initiation as well as amplification of inflammation in airways. However, still there are no good anti-oxidant strategies available for therapeutic intervention in asthma pathogenesis. Most recent studies suggest that polyol pathway enzyme, aldose reductase (AR), contributes to the pathogenesis of oxidative stress–induced inflammation by affecting the NF-kB-dependent expression of cytokines and chemokines and therefore inhibitors of AR could be antiinflammatory. Since inhibitors of AR have already gone through phase-III clinical studies for diabetic complications and found to be safe, our hypothesis is that AR inhibitors could be novel therapeutic drugs for the prevention and treatment of asthma. Hence, we investigated the efficacy of AR inhibition in the prevention of allergic responses to a common natural <b>airborne</b> <b>allergen,</b> ragweed pollen that leads to airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness in a murine model of asthma. Methods and Findings: Primary Human Small Airway Epithelial Cells (SAEC) were used to investigate the in vitro effects of AR inhibition on ragweed pollen extract (RWE) -induced cytotoxic and inflammatory signals.
