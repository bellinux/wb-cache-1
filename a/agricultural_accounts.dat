40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{estimates of}} agricultural productivity (net value added per full-time labour unit) for 21 German regions {{for the years}} 1880 / 4, 1893 / 7 and 1905 / 9. The estimates are derived from regional accounts for agricultural production and costs.

Productivity in southern Germany was not growing so fast. The reasons for this improvement east of the Elbe are examined using a Kreis-level data set. This shows that yield improvements were not limited to large farms and estates, but that smaller holdings also had access to new technology and improved husbandry methods. In short, East-Elbian agriculture should not be seen as backward or bound by tradition: it was a modern sector capable of rapid improvements in techniques and methods of production. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a coherent approach to describe the agri‐food and other bio‐based accounts in the European Union. The paper presents a case study of Spain based on a Social Accounting Matrix with a highly disaggregated <b>agricultural</b> <b>account</b> for the year 2000.

It employs a single country CGE (STAGE 2) model calibrated to an extended version of a recently constructed SAM for Egypt 2008 / 09. The SAM segments the <b>agricultural</b> <b>accounts</b> by season and by irrigation scheme, including Nile- and groundwater-dependent as well as rain-fed agricultural activities. The simulations show that Egypt should manage potential reductions in the supply of Nile water with more efficient irrigation practices which increase the productivity of Nile water, groundwater and irrigated land. The results suggest a more ambitious plan to boost irrigation efficiency for summer rice would be desirable in order to outweigh any potential shrinkage in output and exports. Furthermore, even doubling all non-conventional water resources {{is not sufficient to}} compensate the potential adverse impacts of Nile water losses.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to present the role and significance of financing with equity capital on individual farms in Poland.

The research was conducted in the Mazowsze. Limitation of financing of the operational and investment activity only to the equity capital, in the opinion of farmers, contributes to less dynamic development of agricultural production {{due to a lack of}} sufficient equity resources for the purchase of machines and devices. The farmers included no requirements concerning warranties and guarantees in the situation of financing with a loan as the most significant advantages of financing with equity capital. Most farmers allocated the saved financial surplus to current or planned investments, assessing such financial strategy as the average level of risk. Such approach to self-financing of the activity was assessed by farmers as average in the context of the effectiveness of using equity capital...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the methodological and conceptual {{aspects of a}} framework, which extends the conventional economic accounts for agriculture with environmental issues, valued in monetary terms. This leads to Economic and Environmental Accounts for Agriculture (EEAA). The EEAA {{are based on the}} conventional <b>agricultural</b> <b>accounts</b> and on existing tools for valuing non-market goods and services. The private costs and benefits of the sector are integrated with external “social ” ones, i. e. commodity goods and services with non- commodity ones. Emphasis is put on those external costs and benefits that are already internalised as taxes and subsidies. As both positive and negative externalities are accounted for, the EEAA allow a better monitoring and evaluation of agriculture’s multifunctionality. They enable simulating impacts of policy instruments, such as a subsidy increase, not only on agricultural income, but also on societal welfare. It also becomes possible to appreciate the shares of different stakeholders (producers, public authorities, water agency, consumers, etc.) in the costs or benefits of the environmental goods and services provided by agriculture.

40|$|Agricultural {{production}} and agricultural policy has many special dimensions. The production structure, income positions, and labour input have large regional disparities, the production intensity is not homogenous in space, and farms have different {{risk factors and}} market possibilities in the different regions of Hungary. Land use and production technology also varies largely, in many regions farming is competitive, highly specialized with big corporate farms, while other regions have small individual farms with mixed production structure and less concentration in land use. There are no direct data for spatial analysis less aggregated than NUTS 3 level. Only the data of agricultural census and administrative database for direct payments are available at settlement and microregional level, but these databases do not provide information of farm income. The income statistics either cannot be disaggregated to micro-regional level (<b>agricultural</b> <b>accounts)</b> or are not representative at this level (FADN).

40|$|In {{the process}} of the European Union enlargement, experts felt an {{increasing}} need for the harmonization of existing systems and the adoption of practices used in the EU countries. Hungary intended to meet the requirements stated by the European Union by introducing, among others, the EU directives, the FADN (Farm Accountancy Data Network) agricultural data network, and the System of <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Accounts</b> as well. Despite the efforts towards rapprochement between accountancy systems and the harmonization of information systems, a judgement of enterprise performance and the practice of income calculation and profitability analysis show great differences in many aspects between the member countries. Considering that financing and profitability problems of enterprises are very important questions in the economy, I regard a comparison of income calculation methods of agricultural enterprises used in some EU countries essential. Regarding the above mentioned situation, the general aim of the paper is to introduce and compare analysing methods used in some EU countries, such as Great-Britain, the Netherlands and Hungary. In the course of comparing income calculation practices and methods in the European Union, first I have briefly examined the reporting system of these countries, and next the formats of profit and loss accounts follow together with the patterns of profit and loss calculation and income categories used in the FADN system for the analysis of agricultural activities in the different countries. After all, in the purpose of getting extra information I have taken into consideration the opportunity cost as well. After reviewing the elements, methods and systems about income calculations, I try to find answers to the following questions: -Are there differences between practices of EU member states despite a seemingly unified European regulation system?-If there are differences, will the shown incomes be of different volume?

40|$|Two {{separate}} {{bills are}} advancing in the 111 th Congress {{that could provide}} nearly $ 4 billion of supplemental funds for agricultural programs in FY 2010. The agricultural provisions in these bills have a relatively small funding impact compared with the nonagricultural provisions in the bills. H. R. 4213 (commonly known as the “tax extenders” bill) would provide up to $ 3. 6 billion for agriculture-related programs. The House and Senate are trading amendments to reconcile differences between each chamber’s version of the bill. The most recent House-passed version from May 28, 2010, includes $ 1. 48 billion for agricultural disaster assistance, $ 1. 15 billion for a settlement of the Pigford lawsuit against the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and $ 1. 06 billion to extend tax provisions for biodiesel and conservation. The Senate-passed version from March 10, 2010, does not contain funding for the Pigford settlement, but does include the other provisions. Difficulty reaching agreement over the budget impact of the bill, {{and the need for}} offsets rather than emergency spending, may be jeopardizing the prospects that some of the agriculture provisions will remain in the bill. H. R. 4899 (a supplemental appropriations bill for war spending and disaster response) would provide relatively smaller appropriations for other agricultural programs, as well as rescind prior appropriations from various <b>agricultural</b> <b>accounts.</b> The House and Senate are trading amendments to reconcile difference between each chamber’s version of the bill. The most recent House-passed version from July 1, 2010, contains $ 1. 4 billion for agriculture before rescissions, including $ 1. 15 billion for the Pigford settlement (duplicated from H. R. 4213 because of procedural uncertainty), $ 150 million for international food aid (P. L. 480 Food for Peace), $ 50 million for food purchases in a domestic nutrition assistance program (The Emergency Food Assistance Program, TEFAP), $ 32 million for the farm loan program (to support an additional $ 950 million of loans), $ 18 million for emergency forest restoration, and additional authorities to raise fees for the Section 502 rural housing loan guarantee program. The Senate-passed version from May 27, 2010, contains $ 200 million for agriculture before rescissions, including identical provisions for the loan programs and forestry, but does not have the Pigford or TEFAP funding. Rescissions from agriculture programs are significant in the most recent House-passed version of H. R. 4899, totaling $ 1. 0 billion, and are much larger than in the Senate-passed bill. The House bill from July 1 would rescind $ 487 million from reserve funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), $ 422 million from rural development (including $ 300 million of rural broadband funding), and $ 70 million from unobligated balances from the Natural Resources Conservation Service.
