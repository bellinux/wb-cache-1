40|$|Alcoholism {{remains a}} {{controversial}} area, concerning both theoretical definitions and modalities of clinical intervention. In spite of this, and {{perhaps as a}} consequence, it stands as a huge public health problem, consuming {{a large amount of}} resources (and mental health services resources in particular). Some clinical issues in this area are reviewed, according to the authors' personal experience. Data related to clinical work in an <b>alcohology</b> centre (South Regional <b>Alcohology</b> Centre-CRAS) are presented. Based in a previous model of Sequential Combined Treatment of Heroin Addicted Patients with Naltrexone and Family Therapy, the authors outline some basic principles of a similar intervention designed for alcoholic patients and their families, which includes, when possible, a family integrated with an individual approach, an emphasis on normativity, on firmness and on self help groups. They revise, on the light of these concepts, the chain of medical care to these kind of patients, outpatient and inpatient, {{and the role of the}} medical doctor, which must not be confounded with the family system.

40|$|The authors {{describe}} {{the results of}} an alcohol education course given to 2166 high school students in the area of Padua, Italy. An evaluation was performed, utilizing a before and after technique: it was shown that baseline knowledge of relevant information on <b>alcohology</b> was similar among younger and older teenagers; also, baseline information and course gain varied according to question content...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this work}} is to promote the {{introduction}} of the <b>alcohology</b> and the “Clinical guidelines for the identification of hazardous and harmful consumption of alcohol and brief intervention” study in Medicine and Surgery degree course, to learn the execution of brief interventions on the population at risk. The authors report a summary of guidelines and the main tools used for the identification of hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption and for the execution of the brief intervention. Moreover, they reported the results of a survey on medical students’ knowledge and drinking habits. It highlighted the lack in the field of knowledge of <b>alcohology,</b> a high frequency of “occasional drinkers” (34. 7 %) and “regular drinkers” (25. 9 %) among the students of the fifth year of the Medicine and Surgery degree course of the Catania University. Intensified education concerning healthy lifestyle coping with consumption of alcohol during medical school could help improve these habits in healthcare professionals and their patients...|$|E
40|$|Alcohol {{has been}} {{considered}} {{a risk factor for}} over a century, but the pathogenesis and natural history of alcohol-related heart disease remains obscure. Numerous researches have demonstrated the beneficial effects of alcohol consumption {{as long as it is}} consumed in moderation. Advances have been made in our understanding of the effects of acute and chronic alcohol administration both at hemodynamic and cellular level, and recent studies have indicated that changes in heart dimensions and function are common in alcoholics. Depending on the amount consumed, alcohol increases blood pressure, which increases the risk of hypertension, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias etc. In terms of overall mortality, epidemiological investigations have shown that in case of young people, drinking any amount of alcohol increases the overall risk of death, the risk being greater as the amount of alcohol consumed increases. The success of the joint efforts of researchers, clinicians, psychologists and of all those whose activity is related to <b>alcohology</b> lies in the ability to convince the society of the importance of this health issue, and that the dependency syndrome that it creates attracts many biological, psychological, social problems...|$|E
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} {{the utility of}} capture-recapture methods to estimate prevalence of subjects with alcohol related disorders using multiple incomplete lists.  DESIGN—This was a cross sectional study of alcohol related disorders in a large community.  SETTING—During 1997  identified cases with known alcohol related disorders were independently flagged by four sources (self help volunteering groups; psychiatric ambulatory; public <b>alcohology</b> service; hospital discharges).  PATIENTS— 381 records were flagged, corresponding to 349  individual cases from a target population resident in a northern Italy area.  MAIN RESULTS—The two sample capture-recapture estimates were clearly biased because of dependencies among sources. Estimates based on log-linear models showed prevalent counts ranged from 2297  (95 % confidence intervals: 1524,  3794) to 2523  (95 % confidence intervals: 1623,  4627) after adjustment for dependence among sources only or also for heterogeneity in catchability among age categories (<  50  and ⩾  50  years), respectively.  CONCLUSIONS—The study suggests that capture-recapture is an appropriate approach for estimating prevalence of subjects with alcohol related problems who seek or need treatment and assistance when different lists of alcoholics {{can be obtained from}} different types of agencies involved with problematic use of alcohol. Critical factors are the complexity in case definition and the analysis of heterogeneity among people. Accurate estimates are needed to plan and evaluate public health interventions.    Keywords: alcohol related problems; capture-recapture; log-linear model...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Aim: To {{delineate}} {{the features of}} treatment compliance which predicted outcome during aftercare treatment {{in a series of}} patients that completed an inpatient program at the Lisbon Regional <b>Alcohology</b> Centre (CRAS). Methods: Seventy-four alcohol dependent patients, sequentially admitted to the inpatient treatment of CRAS, were followed over 6 months after discharge. This study focused on the predictive value of the aftercare therapies, which included: attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, attending aftercare groups (AG), attending outpatient consultations with the medical assistant. Disulfiram was prescribed to 83. 3 % of the patients. At the end of the 6 -months follow-up period, the patients and their ‘significant others ’ (co-responsible persons) were interviewed on the telephone by an independent interviewer. The data collected for analysis consists of information from the interviews, and also of data from the patient clinical files. Results: Survival analysis revealed that, after 6 months of follow-up, 39. 2 % of the patients had attained total abstinence of alcohol ingestion; 71 % of the relapses on alcohol consumption occurred within the first 3 months. The median number of days taking disulfiram was significantly related to the number of days of abstinence. Demographic variables, pre-treatment variables, attendance at AA meetings, AGs and outpatient appointments were not significant predictors of outcome. Conclusions: Consistently taking disulfiram is associated with good outcome, but this may reflect committment to abstinence as well as a treatment effect...|$|E
40|$|Alcohol {{abuse is}} one of the most {{important}} risk factors for health and is a major cause of death and morbidity. Despite this, only about one-tenth of individuals with alcohol abuse disorders receive therapeutic intervention and specific rehabilitation. Among the various dichotomies that limit an effective approach to the problem of alcohol use disorder treatment, one of the most prominent is integrated treatment versus harm reduction. For years, these two divergent strategies have been considered to be opposite poles of different philosophies of intervention. One is bound to the search for methods that aim to lead the subject to complete abstinence; the other prioritizes a progressive decline in substance use, with maximum reduction in the damage that is correlated with curtailing that use. Reduction of alcohol intake does not require any particular setting, but does require close collaboration between the general practitioner, specialized services for addiction, <b>alcohology</b> services and psychiatry. In patients who reach that target, significant savings in terms of health and social costs can be achieved. Harm reduction is a desirable target, even from an economic point of view. At the present state of neuroscientific knowledge, it is possible to go one step further in the logic that led to the integration of psychosocial and pharmacological approaches, by attempting to remove the shadows of social judgment that, at present, are aiming for a course of treatment that is directed towards absolute abstention...|$|E
