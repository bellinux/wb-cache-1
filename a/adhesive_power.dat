50|$|The group {{prepared}} flexible fibers of polyimide as {{the synthetic}} setae structures {{on the surface}} of a 5m thick film of the same material using electron beam lithography and dry etching in an oxygen plasma. The fibres were 2m long, with a diameter of around 500 nm and a periodicity of 1.6m, and covered an area of roughly 1 cm2 (see figure on the left). Initially, the team used a silicon wafer as a substrate but found that the tape’s <b>adhesive</b> <b>power</b> increased by almost 1,000 times if they used a soft bonding substrate such as Scotch tape - This is because the flexible substrate yields a much higher ratio of the number of setae in contact with the surface over the total number of setae.|$|E
40|$|In a {{multicolor}} {{offset press}} the process inks (kcmy) will be printed consecutively on the substrate from oneprinting unit to the other. The printing dots and elements in different process color will be printed either isolated, partly orcompletely overprinted {{depending on the}} halftoning. In a multicolor press the inks will be printed wet on wet. That meansthat {{in the area where}} process inks overlap each other one or more inks will be printed on another ink which is not dryenough. The <b>adhesive</b> <b>power</b> between the wet inks is different and less compared to the <b>adhesive</b> <b>power</b> between one inkprinted {{on the top of a}} less wet ink or even a completely dry ink. The <b>adhesive</b> <b>power</b> between the substrate and printed ink isalso different from the <b>adhesive</b> <b>power</b> of one ink on the top of another one. Depending on this <b>adhesive</b> <b>power</b> and the inks’inner cohesion power the thickness of the second printed ink varies. The thickness or amount of the second printed ink on thefirst one can be determined; its value is called trapping. The amount of the trapping will also be changed due to differentparameters such as ink temperature, dampening, printing speed etc. An important outcome is that the gray balance and thecolor appearance (secondary and tertiary colors) of the printed product also depend very much on the trapping’s amount. Thatshows how important it is to have an explicit value for the trapping. The amount of the second printed inks will bedetermined by trapping formulas. This value should be useful for the printer at the press. Unfortunately, the conventionaltrapping formulas are only useful for the “relative” comparison of trapping between two print products. All the conventionalformulas for trapping only deliver the amount of the second printed ink on the top of the first one in percent. This value for itsown (e. g. 63 %) is not really useful and meaningful for print machine operators. There are three different formulas fordetermining trapping. These are Preucil, Ritz, and Brunner. All of them are based on density only. The results of theseformulas are different to each other, especially the Brunner formula differs to the other ones. Here a method will beintroduced which is based on spectrometry and will complement the conventional formulas. Shahram Hauck is Printing process and quality manager at manroland, Germany</p...|$|E

40|$|Background: The use of {{surgical}} adhesive tapes after minor surgical and dermatologic operations is widespread. Their use reduces the wound tension and separation and they ultimately improve the postoperative scar. The {{most commonly used}} wound adhesives to enhance the adhesiveness of the surgical tapes, are tincture of benzoin and mastisol. Aim: The {{purpose of the present}} study is to demonstrate the role of <b>adhesive</b> <b>power</b> of dressing spray with the adhesive tape application on the skin, which is widely used in clinics after the skin closure. Methods: Fifteen volunteers who were chosen among the medical personnel of the hospital comprised the study group. The skin of the flexor aspect of the 1 / 3 middle forearm of the subjects was used as the procedure region. The data is collected in the first, second and eighth days of the study. At the first stage of the study, an adhesive wound closure tape was applied to the skin without any compound of adhesives (group A). In the second and third stages, a thin coat of transparent film dressing spray (group B) and an adhesive compound of tincture of benzoin (group C) were applied to the skin before the adhesive tape placement, respectively. Different values of weights ranging between 50 - 900 gm were hanged by hooking into the center of the adhesive tape. The weights that caused complete separations of the tape from the skin after exactly 20 seconds were recorded in all groups. The data was analyzed by using Friedman test in order to calculate statistical significance between groups A, B and C. Results: The difference in <b>adhesive</b> <b>power</b> between control and groups B and C was found to be highly significant (p < 0. 05). Compound tincture of benzoin was observed to have greatest adhesive strength. Transparent film dressing spray was not as efficient as tincture of benzoin, but when compared with the control group, it enhanced the tape adhesion by 2 -fold. Conclusion: The results indicated that dressing spray tested has an additional <b>adhesive</b> <b>power</b> besides its well known features and that it can be used as an efficient alternative material among other adhesive compounds...|$|E

The aim of the paper is to examine the gel hydration of accessible "prosthesis adhesives" in the function of the defined time intervals of the water supply upon the specific retention force F of the experimental small blocks EP of familiar surface, made of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). For experiments in vitro an apparatus composition was made to provide for continuous water supply through a semi-permeable membrane as well as for dilution of the viscous gel made of water and prosthetic <b>adhesive.</b> <b>Powered</b> and paste <b>adhesives</b> were used. The results show that F is the smallest under the circumstances when the interpolated fluid between the EP and the apparatus membrane is distilled water in all the defined supply intervals (after 0 - 5 minutes, after 6 - 11 minutes and after 60 minutes of the supply at the temperature of 37 ° C). At the water supply from 0 to 5 minutes the highest values of F are registered for the gel "Super Corega" powder as revealed in the statistic importance of the differences for the tested couple "Super Corega" powder distilled water. After 6 - 11 minutes of water supply, the highest values of F are registered for the gel "Kukident" cream though the values are very close in the remaining two adhesives as well as confirmed by the t-test results that are still the highest for the treated couple "Kukident" cream - distilled water.

The amplitudes of the pulses have been 5 and 10 A. Power supported by these pulses into the adhesive bonds has been chosen very low to cause very low increase of {{the temperature of the}} bond only. Therefore changes of examined electrical parameters have been dominantly caused with effects different from effects caused by thermal aging. The specimens have been prepared by mounting of resistors with "zero" value on a test board with Cu layout which has made 4 -point measurement of the bonds possible. Seven resistors have been mounted on one board. Two types of isotropic electrically conductive adhesives with Bisphenol A resin binder and Ag filler have been used. Resistance of the bonds has been measured. The pulses have been applied at the normal temperature and at the temperature of 90 °C, the time of application of the pulses has been 90 minutes.

40|$|Renewable {{energy is}} {{becoming}} {{an important source of}} energy due to the rise in crude oil prices and the increase in greenhouse effects due to burning of fossil fuels. With only finite source of fossil fuel and exponential increase in the demand of power because of increase in human population, power generation from renewable energy promises a sustainable future for the mankind. Currently, solar thermal technologies convert energy from the sun into useful thermal energy. Solar energy is intermittent in nature and most solar thermal technologies require separate collectors and storage systems. This makes them expensive to operate. Furthermore, power generation from low grade heat is currently restricted to vapour compression cycles with low reliability and high maintenance cost. There is a need to explore low cost integrated solar thermal collector and storage system and an alternative technology to convert this low grade heat into electricity. A salinity gradient solar pond is a low-cost solar collector with long term thermal storage capability. It utilizes a large body of saline water with increasing density gradient from top to bottom that absorb solar radiation and stores the thermal energy. Solar ponds have been simple and low cost solar energy system for a relatively longer period of time and very stable with the intermittent supply of solar energy. A thermoelectric generator (TEG) has the advantage that it can operate from a low grade heat source such as waste heat energy. Heat is supplied at hot side of the thermoelectric cell while the other end is maintained at a lower temperature by a heat sink. As a result of the temperature difference, Seebeck voltage is generated that result in current flow through an external load resistance. There are no moving components in the TEG and this will lead to a reliable, quiet and maintenance free operation for power generation. Although Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC) engine is currently used to generate electricity from solar pond using low grade heat, it still requires a certain threshold in the temperature difference of the system. The TEGs however works without any temperature difference threshold needed for its operation. The main aims of this project are to develop a system for conversion of low grade heat (&lt; 100 &ordm;C) to work and effective utilisation of low driving temperature differences from low grade heat for heat to work conversion. This thesis examines the potential of power generation from solar pond using TEGs with innovative new designs. Theoretical analysis was developed to investigate the performance of TEGs with low grade heat input. The thesis also explains the systematic procedure of design and manufacturing of TEG heat exchangers. Experimental test rigs and instrumentations used for testing the prototypes are explained in detail. The effect of thermal <b>adhesives</b> on <b>power</b> output from TEGs without any mechanical fixtures presented shows remarkable potential for large scale TEG heat exchangers. The effect of thermal variation on the performance of TEGs are also studied and highlighted in the thesis...|$|R

Long-standing {{problems of}} damaging contact surfaces of rail wheels demand {{an extension of}} research works which will aim {{at some of the}} new approaches towards the issue of limiting state of environment which is formed, by rolling of generally loaded wheel, in the area of surface layers of running surface. The presented research programme is mainly based on the proven fact that specific problems of a rail wheel life are based on degradation actions caused by a complicated loading in the area of contact which is specific for the wheels that are braked by disk brakes. Such system of braking is, at present, consistently applied mainly to the sets of passenger train carriages and tends to extend also to sets of goods trains. Specificity of the issue of such braked wheels was reliably proven by the occurrence of continuing damages of wheel surfaces when compared with the wheels that are braked by block brakes. The specificity is mainly caused by diametrically different thermal processes in the area of contact. The character of thermal effects of wheels, which are not in contact with brake blocks, requires the viewpoint of microscopic transmission of heat, which does not exclude its wave propagation in a thin surface layer with all possible effects owing to the limiting states. Lot of works, see herein cited literary sources, point out emerging microstructural changes combined with mechanical damaging of contact surfaces, and the thickness of affected layers was predicted by dimension to order 10 - 4 mm. It also corresponds with the results of analyses describing so far insufficiently explained hard structures termed as White Etching Layers. Another finding, arising from conclusions of performed researches, {{is the fact that the}} entire structural anomalies are localized right in the surface layer that is becoming a potential area from which the defects can be spread into a basic and unaffected material of the wheel. It can be started from the work hypothesis that the entire actions in the surface layer have a dynamic character and that they differ from the actions rising in the basic material. In other words, a distinct material discontinuity can be formed by contact effects. One of the essential problems is a detailed study of the process of surface layer plastization, therefore the main aim of the presented investigation is both theoretical and experimental study of that contact area. From the point of view of metallographic experiments, the research was focussed on the level of homogeneity of plastic deformations, its rise influenced by contact loading and the effects resulting from further exploitation arising from continuous generating of a loaded wheel. Insufficient attention has been drawn to vibratory motions of surface layer particles. It is obvious from some of the published works, that the character of motion of surface particles, which are evoked by slip processes, can be considered as self-excited oscillation of relaxation type, which can result in the rise of penetrative dynamic powers in tangential direction having impulse character. Adhesive wheel rolling leads to tribologic effects of dynamic character. Dynamic aspects of wheel contact with rail have not been studied from the viewpoint of wave effect spreading yet. Therefore, the aim of the presented research is to study contact as dynamic joining of two continua in which, besides compression wave motion, surface Rayleigh and Loevov waves are propagated with respect to a limited environment. The answer to the problem of how much above mentioned wave effects could affect the limiting states of surface layers has been sought by a theoretical solution. The issue of plastization is emphasised also on the basis of theoretical studies which are based on numerical modelling. Important studies which arise from bilinear material characteristics are stated in the above mentioned literature. The authors of the paper intend to form an essential orientation in energy balance of plastic deformations by the study of energy balance of contact on the base of phenomenological plasticity. These processes, whose results is a higher hardness level, can be comprehensivelly experimentally studied on the current testing equipment that has been assembled in laboratories of the Jan Perner Transport Faculty, University of Pardubice, for experimental observing of oscillation of surface layer particles on the railway wheel running surface interrelating to wear processes and processes clarifying <b>adhesive</b> transfer of <b>power.</b> Within the realised research, a required modification of current testing equipment with a view to generating plastic deformations and consequent hardness of surface layers of inserted material samples was realised. The way of history mapping of running surface loading could be searched by this way. The way was necessary for the stating of new ideas about limiting state in the area of contact. Original know-how, on which bases it will be possible to contribute to improvement of the knowledge of adhesive transfer in contact, has been expected as secondary results of these investigations. From the point of view of material, the knowledge of optimization process of choice for suitable construction wheel material can be expected in near future, with regard to constant standard of rail as well as railway wheel applied material...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{light transmission}} and preference for six eye patches for occlusion therapy. Methods: Six patches were examined, including; Ortopad Fun Pack, Ortopad Flesh, Kawamoto A- 1, Kawamoto A- 2, 3 M Opticlude, and Everade Eye Guard. The {{size and the}} presence of a light blocking pad of patches were investigated. The amount of light transmitted through the patches was evaluated, using a digital light meter and a model eye, in three different environments; indoors with fluorescent light, outdoors on a sunny day, and strong light from illuminator. After patching the normal eye, the flash visual evoked potential (VEP) was measured. Thirty patients with amblyopia or horizontal strabismus, who received occlusion therapy as initial treatment, were included. After using all six patches, patients completed a 7 -item questionnaire regarding the patch preference for size, color and shape, <b>adhesive</b> <b>power,</b> pain with removal, skin irritation after removing patch, parent’s preference and overall opinion. Results: All patches had a light-blocking pad, except the 3 M Nexcare. Ortopad had the strongest light blocking power in the three environments, and the 3 M Nexcare had the weakest power. In flash VEP, Ortopad and Kawamoto patches showed flat, but 3 M Nexcare and Everade Eye Guard showed normal response.

40|$|Background. Anastomosis of {{the nerve}} {{especially}} at narrow surgical field and presence of surgical tension {{is not easily}} accessible. DuraSeal demonstrates strong <b>adhesive</b> <b>power</b> without producing neurotoxicity. Herein, we evaluate the possibility of DuraSeal as a substitute in the repair of sciatic nerve gap injury. Materials and Methods. The nerve gap model was constructed by excising the sciatic nerve (5 mm in length) in Sprague Dawley rats leaving a 5 mm nerve defect between nerve stumps. Animals were categorized into four groups: Group I: no treatment; Group II: 4 stitches suture; Group III: nerve approximation fixed by tissue glue; Group IV: nerve approximation fixed by DuraSeal. The motor function assessment included the CatWalk and SFI as well as electrophysiological studies. Nerve continuity and regeneration was examined at 1 and 8 wk after injury. The inflammatory cells, Schwann cell apoptosis, and Schwann cell proliferation were also investigated 1 wk after injury. Results. The achievement of nerve continuity and myelination by DuraSeal approached that of suture demonstrated by crystal violet and Luxol Fast Blue staining at 1 and 8 wk, respectively. Motor function and electrophysiological parameters were restored in DuraSeal and suture group. Early expression of neurofilament and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was also observed in these two groups. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in deposits of macrophages and neutrophil cells or cell apoptosis among these four groups. Conclusions. DuraSeal achieved the same nerve regeneration compared with that of suture and produced better regeneration than that of the tissue glue or without any treatment. The accomplishment of nerve regeneration and continuity without causing neurotoxicity justifies using DuraSeal as a ligature in the anastomosis of nerve gap injury. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|In this thesis, {{detailed}} comparative {{investigations into}} the effect of different storage conditions and durations onto the stability and resistance of metal-plastics compounds derived from surface conditionings have been presented. Shear-off-techniques were utilized to test the firmness of the compounds. Clogged Wirobond ® C and Wiron ® NT metal plates of different sizes were employed as test specimen. The clogging was accomplished by Compolute ® or PANAVIA F ® adhesives. An intermediate silicate layer was spreaded using either the Rocatec technology or a blow torch (pyrolysis conditions). In order to scrutinize {{the effect of the}} oral environment on the compound firmness, samples were exposed to an artificial aging process. The quality of the fracture was determined by visual evaluation of the fractured surfaces, with the presence of plastics on the sheared surfaces being the decisive criterion. In the following, a summary {{of the results of the}} underlying studies is given. All compound combinations exhibited the required minimal firmness of 5 MPa according to the ISO supplement 10477. Compolute ® adhesive in combination with the Rocatec technology assured the highest values. However, pyrolytic conditionings gave varying results depending on the adhesive employed. Generally, Compolute ® was shown to afford higher firmness values than PANAVIA F ®. The lowest values were obtained for the alloy primer compound using PANAVIA F ®. Furthermore, it was unambiguously proven that the spreading of an additional silicate-based intermediate layer allows the preparation of a highly stable metal-plastics compound that exhibits excellent resistance to hydrolysis conditions. Upon artificial aging, the <b>adhesive</b> <b>power</b> of the investigated metal-plastics compounds decreased dramatically. Consistently, the fractured surfaces did not show any remaining plastics residues. The other fractures featured varying fracture qualities leaving behind crescent-shaped notches in the plastics surfaces. The deformation of the adhesive geometry prior to fracture might account for this observed demolition of the plastics. The application of pyrolytic conditioning with a modified blow torch constitutes a convenient means for the onsite manipulation by the dentist, since the observed adhesion values are coequal to those derived from coventional adhesion methodologies...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the effect of temperature and time depolymerization of natural latex rubber using NaNO 2, H 2 O 2 and Ascorbic Acid (0. 4 : 0. 2 : 0. 1) mol at pH about 5 towards its molecular weight reduction, then studied the effect on the quality of adhesives produced. The stages of this research include making concentrated natural rubber latex, its depolymerization, rubber crepe making, rubber compounding and followed by rubber adhesives manufacturing. Depolymerization is conducted by varying the temperature (50, 70 and 90 oC) with the duration (4, 6, 8, and 10 hours). The indication of molecular weight reduction is determined by the mooney viscosity test, while the quality of the rubber adhesives is evaluated from the Brookfield viscosity test and its peel strength. Concentrated Natural Rubber was successfully prepared using 2 % (v / v) ammonium laurate 20 % and 0. 2 % (v / v) 2 % sodium alginate resulted in dry rubber content 49. 36 %, mechanical stability 91 seconds, ammonia 0. 58 % and Viscosity Mooney 193. 80 cp. Chemical depolymerization is able to reduce the viscosity mooney of natural rubber approximately 95 %. The results showed that the greatest molecular weight reduction was depolymerization at 70 ° C for 8 hours indicated by decreasing the mooney viscosity from 193. 80 to 10. 05 cp.

40|$|Most textile mills use sizes {{based on}} {{synthetic}} agents. In practice {{these products are}} not or only partly biodegradable. Therefore they should not run into municipal treatment plants. Nevertheless the market share of these sizes has been increasing continuously {{during the last few}} years. The main reason is: synthetic sizes meet best the requirements of modern weaving technology, while starch based biogradable sizes don't do this satisfactory. Therefore the aim of the research project is to develop size agents based on modified starch which are high-efficient and well biogradable and/or to modifiy synthetic sizes to improve their biogradability and elimination rate in purification processes. These new products will be tested at sizing and desizing processes under practical conditions in weaving and finishing mills. Furthermore the disposability of the resulting effluent in municipal waste water treatment respectively its degradability in aerobic biological purification processes will be examined. The new products will also be tested for their recovery in the ultrafiltration processes as well as for biodegradability in anaerobic processes. The project is being realizes by the ITV Denkendorf together with industrial partners, such as leading manufactorers of size agents and weaving and finishing mills. The Kolb and Schuele AG, Kirchheim/Teck, performed broken end analysis on their normally sized warps. The results can b e a standard of comparison for forthcoming tests of new products. The standard warps showed good performance in weaving. Due to being oversized a compared test warp did not perform as well. Another test warp was sized with a product of a project partner and was woven and desized under practical conditions in the mill. At the beginning of the project the ITV Denkendorf did <b>adhesive</b> <b>power</b> measurements of three types of cotton fibre of Kolb and Schuele AG to find out the best suitable fibres for this testing method. In cooperation with the ITV the weaving and sizing departments were analyzed to get a good base for the tests of the new sizing agents. (orig.)

40|$|Der Sprossen-assoziierte EHEC-Ausbruch von 2011 wurde von einem neuartigen und hochgradig virulenten E. coli-Stamm verursacht, der Virulenzeigenschaften von STEC und EAEC kombinierte. Klassische STEC-Stämme sind an das Rind adaptiert und modulieren die bovine Immunantwort für eine dauerhafte und asymptomatische Kolonisation. Hingegen wird als natürliches Reservoir von EAEC-Stämmen der Mensch vermutet, da die Isolation typischer EAEC-Stämme bisher hauptsächlich aus dem Menschen erfolgte. Vergleichbar schwere EHEC-Ausbrüche könnten jederzeit auftreten. Allerdings ist aufgrund der Hybridvirulenz des Ausbruchstammes die Herkunft und das natürliche Reservoir nach wie vor unbekannt. Wir wollten die {{relative}} Wirtsadaption des Hybridstammes an Mensch und Rind klären, um die Fähigkeit des Hybridstammes zur Persistenz im bovinen Reservoir abzuschätzen. Im natürlichen Reservoir bildet sich ein Gleichgewicht zwischen den Virulenzfaktoren des Erregers und der Immunantwort des Wirts aus. Ist der Hybridstamm nicht ans Rind adaptiert, erwarten wir im Vergleich zu bovin assoziierten Stämmen eine weniger effektive Immunmodulation und mehr proinflammatorische Aktivität im bovinen Wirtszellsystem sowie eine erhöhte Expression von Virulenzgenen bei Wirtszellkontakt. In-vitro untersuchten wir vergleichend die Interaktion des Hybridstammes mit intestinalen Epithelzellen von Mensch und Rind. Dabei wurden das Adhäsions- und Invasionsvermögen sowie das Potential des Hybridstammes zur Modulation der Wirtszellantwort von Mensch und Rind bestimmt, sowie die Expression von Virulenzfaktoren. Das Reaktionsprofil des Hybridstammes wurde vergleichend zu human und bovin assoziierten E. coli-Stämmen klassischer Pathovare oder avirulenten Stämmen bewertet. Als Modell für die lokale Immunmodulation im Rind wurden primäre Makrophagen mit konditionierten, steril filtrierten Überständen aus der Koinkubation von E. coli mit Epithelzellen stimuliert. Das Potential zur systemischen Immunmodulation im Rind wurde ex-vivo untersucht. Der Hybridstamm war fähig, die intestinalen Epithelzellen von Mensch und Rind jeweils aus Dünn- und Dickdarm zu kolonisieren. Elektronenmikroskopisch zeigte der Hybridstamm jedoch eine starke Affinität zu humanen Dünndarmzellen, im Gegensatz zu wenig direktem Zellkontakt mit bovinen Dünndarmzellen. Der Hybridstamm zeigte ein hochgradiges Adhäsionsvermögen, vergleichbar mit human assoziierten Stämmen. Im Gegensatz zum Hybridstamm adhärierten die bovin assoziierten STEC-Stämme geringer an die Wirtszellen. Weiterhin war der Hybridstamm im Unterschied zum invasiven Phänotyp einiger bovin assoziierter STEC-Stämme nicht invasiv. Ähnlich wie kommensale und human assoziierte E. coli-Stämme induzierte der Hybridstamm in humanen Wirtszellen nur wenig proinflam-matorische Aktivität. Erst verzögert nach 6 h zeigte der Hybridstamm proinflammatorische Aktivität im humanen Wirtszellsystem, aber in geringerem Ausmaß als andere Pathovare. Hingegen induzierte der Hybridstamm im bovinen Wirtszellsystem starke proinflammatorische Effekte, zunächst vergleichbar mit dem human assoziierten EAEC-Stamm 55989. Verzögert nach 6 h verursachte der Hybridstamm die stärkste proinflammatorische Aktivität von allen untersuchten E. coli-Stämmen. Auch in den bovinen Makrophagen induzierte der Hybridstamm indirekt einen stark proinflammatorischen Zellzustand. Bovin assoziierte STEC-Stämme verhinderten eher die Entstehung einer proinflammatorischen Reaktionslage in bovinen Epithelzellen und Makrophagen. Der Hybridstamm exprimierte die Virulenzfaktoren verstärkt bei Wirtszellkontakt mit Dünndarmzellen, unabhängig der Wirtspezies und trotz seiner Hybridvirulenz vergleichbar zu anderen Pathovaren. Unter den Stx 2 -positiven Stämmen war die Stx-Sekretion des Hybridstammes vergleichbar zum EHEC-Stamm 86 - 24 und stärker als beim bovin assoziierten STEC-Stamm. Absolut sekretierte der Hybridstamm weniger oder ähnlich viel Stx wie die klassischen human assoziierten EHEC-Stämme, aber die Stx-Induzierbarkeit bei direktem Wirtszellkontakt war am stärksten ausgeprägt beim Hybridstamm. Die Zytotoxizität des Hybridstammes war vergleichbar zu anderen Pathovaren und stärker als die avirulenter E. coli-Stämme. Wie human assoziierte Stämme beeinträchtigte die Infektion mit dem Hybridstamm nicht die Permeabilitätsbarriere bei humanen, polarisierten Darmepithelzellen. Die beobachteten Reaktionsmuster aller in dieser Arbeit getesteten Stämme waren sehr heterogen. Trotz der Fähigkeit zur Stx-Produktion und Kolonisation der bovinen Zellen in-vitro und in-vivo scheint der Hybridstamm eher an den Menschen als an das Rind adaptiert zu sein. In Übereinstimmung damit eliminierten experimentell infizierte Kälbern den Hybridstamm effizienter als den EHEC-Stamm 86 - 24. Insgesamt ergaben sich aber weniger deutliche Unterschiede im Reaktionsmuster des Hybridstammes zu dem von Stämmen, die andere Pathovare repräsentierten, oder auch zu denen avirulenter E. coli-Stämme als vermutet. Bei zukünftigen Ausbrüchen mit seltenen EHEC-Stämmen und neuartigen Virulenzprofilen sollten deshalb auch mögliche tierische Infektionsquellen in Betracht gezogen werden, um eine frühzeitige Eindämmung der Epidemie zu ermöglichen. In 2011, Germany {{was struck}} by the largest outbreak of hemolytic uremic syndrome caused by a novel and highly virulent E. coli O 104 :H 4 strain, combining virulence factors from both enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) and Shiga toxin (Stx) -producing E. coli (STEC). Cattle are the primary reservoir for STEC, which are capable of modulating the bovine immune system to promote a persistent and asymptomatic lifestyle. EAEC are considered highly adapted to humans, since they have rarely been detected in animals before. Due to the hybrid virulence profile, the natural reservoir of the outbreak strains remains obscure; however, outbreaks of comparable severity may occur again. This study aimed at appraising the relative level of host adaption of E. coli O 104 :H 4 outbreak strain to possible reservoir hosts. Virulence factors of bacterial pathogens counteract elements of the immune control in the natural reservoir, generating a balance between pathogen and host. If cattle are not the reservoir of E. coli O 104 :H 4 outbreak strain, we expect a less effective modulation of the bovine immune response as compared to bovine-associated E. coli strains. If the E. coli O 104 :H 4 outbreak strain is not adapted to cattle, its interaction with bovine host cells might lead to a high-level of pro-inflammatory activity and overwhelming expression of virulence factors. Therefore, we investigated the interaction of the E. coli O 104 :H 4 outbreak strain with intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) of human and bovine origin. We assessed the outbreak strains potential to adhere to and invade into host-specific IEC, as well as its capacity to modulate the host gene expression of selected cytokines. Furthermore, expression of bacterial virulence genes after host cell contact was quantified. The outbreaks strain reaction profile was compared to both bovine- und human-associated E. coli strains; the latter were representative of different pathovars or non-pathogenic E. coli. In addition, we evaluated the outbreak strains immunomodulatory capability by stimulating primary, bovine macrophages with conditioned supernatants from previous infection studies with E. coli and intestinal epithelial cells. Finally, we assessed the outbreak strains potential to suppress the development of an adaptive, antigen-specific cellular immune response in cattle in comparison to bovine-associated STEC. The outbreak strain was able to adhere to intestinal (jejunal and colonic) epithelial cells (IEC) of human and bovine origin. Electron microscopy of infected cells revealed the strains great affinity to human small intestinal cells, in contrast to few direct interactions with bovine small intestinal cells. The outbreak strain possessed a high-level of <b>adhesive</b> <b>power,</b> similar to human-associated E. coli strains and in contrast to bovine-associated STEC strains. The bovine-associated STEC strains exerted low levels of adhesion to host-specific IECs. The outbreak strain displayed a non-invasive phenotype, in contrast to some bovine-associated E. coli strains which invaded into the host cells. During the initial interaction with human host cells, the outbreak strain induced only little inflammatory cell response, comparable to the extent of commensal bacteria and human-associated E. coli strains. After a prolonged incubation period (6 h), the outbreak strain provoked some pro-inflammatory activity in human cells, but to a lower extent as compared to other pathogenic E. coli strains. The outbreak strain induced marked pro-inflammatory activity interacting with bovine host cells. During the interaction with bovine cells, the outbreak strain initially induced an inflammatory cell response comparable to EAEC strain 55989. The outbreak strain induced the strongest delayed inflammatory response of all strains tested (i. e. after 6 h of co-incubation). In addition, the outbreak strain was capable of indirectly inducing a strong pro-inflammatory activity in bovine macrophages (by transfer of conditioned epithelial cell culture supernatants), which served as model for the innate immunity of the bovine gut. In contrast, bovine-associated E. coli strains limited the pro-inflammatory activity in bovine IEC and macrophages. The outbreak strain, like other pathogenic E. coli strains, enhanced the expression of virulence-associated factors after adhesion, especially after adhesion to small intestinal cells and fairly independent of the host species of the cells. Among Stx 2 -positive strains, the outbreak strain and EHEC strain 86 - 24 released comparable levels of Stx and both human-pathogenic strains released higher amounts of Stx compared to bovine-associated STEC. In total, the Stx secretion of the outbreak strain resembled that of other human-associated E. coli strains. However, the outbreak strain displayed the highest inducibility of Stx 2 production upon host cell contact. The outbreak strain was capable of eliciting cytotoxic effects in host cells, comparable to other pathogenic E. coli, but in contrast to avirulent E. coli strains. Nevertheless, the outbreak strain was unable to disrupt the polarized monolayer of CaCo- 2 -cells as well as other human-associated E. coli strains. The reaction patterns observed after interaction of the several strains included in this study with intestinal epithelial cells were strikingly heterogeneous. The E. coli O 104 :H 4 outbreak strain seems to be more likely adapted to humans than to cattle, despite its capacity to produce Stx and transiently colonize bovine IEC in-vitro and in-vivo. This is in accordance with the reduced and shortened fecal excretion of the outbreak strain after experimental infection of calves in comparison to strain 86 - 24. Nevertheless, overall patterns induced by the outbreak strain were less different from those induced by other pathogenic and even avirulent E. coli strains than anticipated. Health authorities should not prematurely exclude animals as an infection source when taking appropriate early intervention measures during future outbreaks with rare EHEC strains or strains with novel virulence profiles...|$|E
