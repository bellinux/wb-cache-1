Seventy eight per cent of the sample participated in sports <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> spent an average of £ 27 per month and an average of 20  min travelling per occasion of sports <b>and</b> <b>exercise.</b> The demand for sport <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> was negatively associated with time (travel or access time) and ‘variable’ price and positively correlated with ‘fixed’ price. Demand was price inelastic, except in the case of meeting the UK government’s recommended level of participation, which is time price elastic (elasticity = − 2. 2).

40|$|Among the {{negative}} consequences of video gaming disorder, decreased participation in sport <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> has received little attention. This study aimed to assess the longitudinal association between video gaming disorder and the level of sport <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> in emerging adult men.

The seven items of the Game Addiction Scale were used to construct a latent variable representing video gaming disorder. Level of sport <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> was also self-reported. Cross-lagged path modeling indicated a reciprocal causality between video gaming disorder and the level of sport <b>and</b> <b>exercise,</b> even after adjusting for a large set of confounders. These findings support the need for better promotion of sport <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> among emerging adults in order to contribute to the prevention of video gaming disorder, and to raise the level of sport <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> activity in addicted gamers...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study aims {{to measure}} the {{associations}} of physical activity {{and one of its}} components, sport <b>and</b> <b>exercise,</b> with at-risk substance use in a population of young men. METHOD: Baseline (2010 - 2012) and follow-up (2012 - 2013) data of 4748 young Swiss men from the Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors (C-SURF) were used. Cross-sectional and prospective associations between at-risk substance use and both sport <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> physical activities were measured using Chi-squared tests and logistic regression models adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: At baseline, logistic regression indicated that sport <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> is negatively associated with at-risk use of cigarettes and cannabis. A positive association was obtained between physical activity and at-risk alcohol use. At baseline, sport <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> was negatively associated with at-risk use of cigarettes and cannabis at follow-up. Adjusted for sport <b>and</b> <b>exercise,</b> physical activity was positively associated with at-risk use of cigarettes and cannabis. CONCLUSION: Sport <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> is cross-sectionally <b>and</b> longitudinally associated with a low prevalence of at-risk use of cigarettes and cannabis. This protective effect was not observed for physical activity broadly defined. Taking a substance use prevention perspective, the promotion of sport <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> among young adults should be encouraged...|$|R

40|$|Trade-offs between {{current and}} future {{consequences}} are characteristic for the domain of health behavior. Therefore, both eating <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior could be determined by time orientation, which refers to an individual’s general orientation toward the present or the future. The main aim of this dissertation is to {{provide insight into the}} relations between time orientation and both eating <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior. The results of this dissertation confirm that time orientation is a shared determinant of eating <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior. Nevertheless, time orientation for food <b>and</b> for <b>exercise</b> are different constructs that, in turn, have differential relations with eating <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior. Specifically, eating behavior is mainly predicted by consideration of immediate consequences, whereas exercising behavior is mainly predicted by consideration of future consequences. In addition, these relations can be partly explained by construal level. Theoretically, the results of this dissertation contribute in various ways {{to a better understanding of}} the construct of time orientation and its relations with eating <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior. Methodologically, the results of this dissertation have several implications for the measurement of time orientation as well as the measurement of eating <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior. Practically, the results of this dissertation can be used in the development of campaigns to stimulate healthy eating <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior. Overall, the insights that have been gained in this dissertation contribute to a better understanding of individuals’ intertemporal decision making in the health domain and can ultimately be used in order to promote and stimulate healthy eating <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hypobaric hypoxia {{results in}} weight loss in obese individuals, <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> {{training}} is advocated {{for the treatment}} of obesity and its related metabolic dysfunctions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effects of hypoxic living <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> training on obesity and adipose tissue leptin/leptin receptor in dietary-induced obese rats. Methods: One hundred and thirty high-fat diet fed Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned into one of the following groups (n= 10 each) : control, sedentary hypoxic living for 1 to 4 weeks (SH 1, SH 2, SH 3, and SH 4), living <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> training in normoxic conditions for 1 to 4 weeks (TN 1, TN 2, TN 3, and TN 4), <b>and</b> living <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> training in hypoxic conditions for 1 to 4 weeks (TN 1, TN 2, TN 3, and TN 4). Epididymal adipose tissue expression levels of leptin and leptin receptor were determined. Results: Compared to hypoxic living <b>and</b> living <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> training in normoxic conditions, living <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> training in hypoxic conditions for 3 - 4 weeks resulted in lower Lee index (P< 0. 05 to P< 0. 01), and higher expression of leptin and leptin receptor (P< 0. 05 to P< 0. 01) in adipose tissue. Conclusion: In a rodent model of altitude training, living <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> training in hypoxic conditions resulted in greater alterations in obesity and adipose tissue leptin/leptin receptor than hypoxic living alone <b>and</b> living <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> training in normoxic conditions...|$|R
