40|$|AC Analog {{voltmeters}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular electronic measuring instruments in use today. They are used to measure the RMS voltage of the many waveforms commonly found in electronics. This article will provide you with the basics of AC analog voltmeters. It will give you a better understanding of their operation, allowing you to select the right one for your particular measurement. The RMS or root-mean-square voltage is measured because this value gives us the most information about the waveform. The RMS voltage is equivalent to a DC voltage which produces the same heating effect as the AC signal being measured. For example, 1 volt of DC across a 1 ohm resistor will dissipate 1 watt. If we substitute any periodic waveform in place of the DC source and adjust its amplitude so that we again have 1 watt of power dissipated in the load, then our AC signal has an RMS or effective value of 1 volt. In addition to its RMS value, a waveform also has a peak and average voltage value. See Figure 1. ov This sine wave has an RMS value of 1 volt. Its peak value is 1. 4 times its RMS value, or 1. 4 volts. Its rectified average or DC value is. 636 times the peak or. 9 volts in the above example. AC voltmeters are designed to respond to one of these three values. This classifies the meters into true RMS responding, <b>average</b> <b>responding</b> and peak responding. The average and peak responding voltmeters are designed to measure only sine waves. <b>Average</b> <b>Responding</b> With an <b>average</b> <b>responding</b> voltmeter, a sine wave being measured is fed through a DC blocking capacitor, amplified or attenuated, rectified by the diode bridge and fed to the meter. The meter then responds to this rectified average or DC value. The average value of a sine wave is zero, so when we say <b>average</b> <b>responding</b> we mean the rectified average or DC component after rectification. This DC component deflects a d’Arsonval (moving coil) meter to indicate the RMS value of a sine wave...|$|E

These typically include economic rationalism, political competition or power struggles, and policy {{imitation of the}} kind that diffuses across spatially proximate neighbors. In this paper, we examine the factors that have influenced a recent local policy trend in California: inclusionary zoning (IZ). IZ programs require developers to make a certain percentage of the units within their market-rate residential developments affordable to low- or moderate-income households. By 2007, 68 percent of jurisdictions in the San Francisco Bay Area had adopted some type of IZ policy. We test the relative importance of economic, political, and spatial factors in explaining the rapid diffusion of IZ, across 100 cities and towns in the Bay Area. Consistent with an economic efficiency argument, results of hazard models provide some evidence that IZ is adopted in places with less affordable housing. However, political factors, such as partisan affiliation and the strength of affordable housing nonprofits, are even more robust predictors of whether or not a local government adopts IZ. There is no evidence of spatial diffusion in the case of IZ adoption; jurisdictions are not, on <b>average,</b> <b>responding</b> to the behavior of their neighbors. © 2010 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management. ...|$|E

The purposes of the Guidelines are to protect students and other stakeholders from low-quality provision and disreputable providers (that is, degree and accreditation mills) as well as to encourage the development of quality cross-border higher education that meets human, social, economic and cultural needs. The Guidelines are not legally binding and member countries are expected to implement them as appropriate in their national context. Based on a survey about the main recommendations of the Guidelines, this report monitors the extent to which OECD countries and a few non-member countries comply with its recommendations. The Survey was sent out in June 2010 to all OECD countries. The Secretariat has also collaborated with the UNESCO Secretariat to have the questionnaire sent to all UNESCO non-OECD country delegations. Twenty-three responses were obtained from 22 Members: Australia, Austria, Belgium (Flemish and French communities), Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Netherlands, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States; and 9 non-Members: Bulgaria, Colombia, Fiji, Indonesia, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Oman, Rwanda. Government representatives were asked to co-ordinate with the other stakeholders covered to answer the survey.

On <b>average,</b> <b>responding</b> OECD countries conform to 72 % of the main recommendations made to governments, tertiary education institutions, and quality assurance and accreditation agencies.

On an item by item basis, there are statistically differences between the averages of the groups on many items. For example, on average, the university students demonstrated less expert-like attitudes about the role of equations and formulas in problem solving, in solving difficult problems, and in knowing when the solution is not correct, whereas they displayed more expert-like attitudes and approaches on items related to meta-cognition in physics problem solving.

This implies that it is optimal for firms to adjust to temporary and relatively short-lived shocks by adjusting average hours and to more persistent shocks by adjusting employment.

The heterogeneous-market model yields highly volatile countercyclical unemployment, and is simultaneously consistent with procyclical reallocation, countercyclical separations and a negatively-sloped Beveridge curve. Moreover, the model exhibits unemployment duration dependence, which (when calibrated to long-term <b>averages)</b> <b>responds</b> realistically to the business cycle, creating substantial longer-term unemployment in downturns.

On average, tactile stimuli were responded to faster as compared to auditory stimuli, and stimuli in the imagery condition were on <b>average</b> <b>responded</b> to slower as compared to baseline performance (left/right discrimination without imagery assignment). The former is probably due to the spatial and somatotopic proximity of the fingers receiving the taps and the thumbs performing the response (button press), the latter to a dual task cost.

When rotation axis and object axis are not aligned, variability is much higher, reaching a maximum at 45 ° misalignment.
