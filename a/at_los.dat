40|$|In {{patients}} with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and acute respiratory failure, acute hyperinflation is likely to induce foreshortening of inspiratory muscles. Since no data are available on the effects of inotropic agents at lengths below the optimal length (Lo), we compared the effects of theophylline on forty rat diaphragm bundles placed <b>at</b> <b>Lo</b> and <b>at</b> 70 % <b>Lo.</b> Twitches and tetanic stimulations were recorded before and after addition of theophylline, in concentrations of 20, 100, 200 or 400 mg. l- 1. Compared with values obtained before theophylline, twitch tension (Pt) and maximal tetanic tension (Po) of the bundles placed <b>at</b> <b>Lo</b> slightly decreased <b>at</b> 20 and 100 mg. l- 1 whereas a clear increase in Pt was obtained at 400 mg. l- 1 (15 +/- 21 % (mean +/- SD)). In contrast, Pt of the bundles placed <b>at</b> 70 % <b>Lo</b> increased with all theophylline concentrations, and vastly more than <b>at</b> <b>Lo</b> (e. g. <b>at</b> 400 mg. l- 1 : 74 +/- 34 %, p < 0. 05); whereas Po slightly decreased, except at 400 mg. l- 1. Moreover, the difference between the effects <b>at</b> <b>Lo</b> and <b>at</b> 70 % <b>Lo</b> increased with increasing theophylline concentrations. We conclude that even at low, in vivo attainable serum levels, theophylline exerted greater positive inotropic effects on twitch tension (Pt) of rat diaphragm when foreshortened than when at optimal length. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Sumo and {{conventional}} deadlifts and {{high and low}} skilled lifters were compared during the 1999 Special Olympics World Games. Two video cameras collected 60 Hz data from 40 subjects, and parameters were quantified <b>at</b> barbell liftoff (<b>LO)</b> and barbell knee passing (KP). The sumo group had a more vertical trunk and horizontal thigh <b>at</b> <b>LO,</b> a less vertical shank at KP, and greater forefoot abduction. The sumo group generated ankle dorsiflexor, knee extensor, and hip extensor moments, while the conventional group produced ankle plantar flexor, knee flexor & extensor, and hip extensor moments. High skilled lifters had a 40 % greater barbell load, greater knee flexion <b>at</b> <b>LO</b> and greater knee extension at KP, 15 % less vertical bar distance, smaller plantar flexor and hip extensor moment arms <b>at</b> <b>LO</b> and KP, and greater knee extensor moment arms <b>at</b> <b>LO.</b> KEY WORDS: powerlifting, moments, angles, kinematics, kinetics, work INTRODUCTION: The deadlift, one of three lifts in powerlifting competition, is performed using either a conventional style (narrow stance with arms outside knees) or sumo style (wide stance with arms inside knees).

40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} theophylline exerted greater inotropic effects on foreshortened canine diaphragm than on diaphragm placed at resting length in vivo (1). To ensure that these effects result from {{an effect on}} the muscle itself, they were examined in vitro. Thus, the effects of increasing doses of theophylline (20, 100, 200, and 400 mg/L) or addition of Krebs solution on twitch tension (Pt) of bundles placed <b>at</b> optimal length (<b>Lo)</b> and 70 % <b>Lo</b> were compared. <b>At</b> <b>Lo,</b> compared with time-matched control, Pt significantly increased after theophylline (e. g., 37 +/- 32 versus - 8 +/- 12 % after 400 mg/L) except with 20 mg/L. <b>At</b> 70 % <b>Lo,</b> Pt increased with all theophylline concentrations in a dose-related manner (e. g., 14 +/- 15 versus - 6 +/- 7 % and 114 +/- 57 versus - 8 +/- 11 % after 20 and 400 mg/L, respectively). Time to peak tension and half-relaxation time remained unchanged after theophylline both <b>at</b> <b>Lo</b> and 70 % Lo. In addition, for a given concentration, twitch potentiation was significantly greater <b>at</b> 70 % <b>Lo</b> than <b>at</b> <b>Lo,</b> the difference increasing with increasing concentration (e. g., 3 times greater with 400 mg/L). We conclude that theophylline-induced inotropic effects on Pt were more pronounced on foreshortened canine diaphragm bundles than on bundles placed <b>at</b> <b>Lo.</b> These observations confirm that theophylline-induced inotropic effects on foreshortened muscle previously observed in vivo are likely to result from a direct effect on muscle contractility. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Graves and Elizabeth {{moved to}} work <b>at</b> <b>Los</b> Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico {{when it opened}} in 1943.

This was probably unnecessary, as someone with her skills—she {{was one of the few}} physicists who had experience with a Cockcroft-Walton accelerator—would have been quickly snapped up <b>at</b> <b>Los</b> Alamos. At the time of the Trinity nuclear test in 1945, Elizabeth was seven months pregnant with her first child. Graves therefore requested that they be assigned to a post far from the blast. They listened to Samuel K. Allison's countdown to the explosion on the radio, and monitored the radioactive fallout from the test, which took until the afternoon to reach them, with Geiger counters. The child was a healthy daughter, Marilyn Edith.|$|E
