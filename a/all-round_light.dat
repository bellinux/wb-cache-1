40|$|This book {{discusses}} {{in detail}} the CMOS implementation of energy harvesting.   The authors describe an integrated, indoor light energy harvesting system, based on a controller circuit that dynamically and automatically adjusts its operation to meet the actual light circumstances of the environment where the system is placed.   The system is intended to power a sensor node, enabling an autonomous wireless sensor network (WSN). Although designed to cope with indoor light levels, the system is also {{able to work with}} higher levels, making it an <b>all-round</b> <b>light</b> energy harvesting system.   The discussion includes experimental data obtained from an integrated manufactured prototype, which in conjunction with a photovoltaic (PV) cell, serves as a proof of concept of the desired energy harvesting system.  ·         Discusses several energy sources which can be used to power energy harvesting systems and includes an overview of PV cell technologies  ·         Includes an introduction to voltage step-up circuits, with a special emphasis on switched-capacitors (SC) DC-DC voltage converters, energy storing devices and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques  ·         Presents a complete design flow of an indoor light energy harvesting system designed and implemented in a CMOS technology...|$|E

5000|$|... (h) The {{repositioning}} of <b>all-round</b> <b>lights</b> {{resulting from}} the prescription of Section 9(b) of Annex I to these Regulations, permanent exemption.|$|R
2500|$|... three <b>all-round</b> <b>lights</b> in a {{vertical}} line {{where they can}} best be seen. The highest and lowest of these lights shall be red and the middle light shall be white; ...|$|R
5000|$|... two <b>all-round</b> <b>lights</b> in a {{vertical}} line, the upper being red {{and the lower}} white, or a shape consisting of two cones with apexes together in {{a vertical}} line one above the other; ...|$|R
5000|$|A vessel {{at anchor}} must display an <b>all-round</b> white <b>light</b> or one black {{ball in the}} fore part and another <b>all-round</b> white <b>light</b> {{at or near the}} stern at a lower level than the light in the fore part. BUT if the vessel is less than 50 meters in length it may exhibit an <b>all-round</b> white <b>light</b> where it can best be seen instead of the lights foresaid.|$|R
5000|$|... 1. two <b>all-round</b> red <b>lights</b> in a {{vertical}} line {{where they can}} best be seen; ...|$|R
5000|$|... (c) A {{sailing vessel}} {{underway}} may, {{in addition to}} the lights prescribed in paragraph (a) of this Rule, exhibit at or {{near the top of the}} mast, where they can best be seen, two <b>all-round</b> <b>lights</b> in a vertical line, the upper being red and the lower green, but these lights shall not be exhibited in conjunction with the combined lantern permitted by paragraph (b) of this Rule.|$|R
2500|$|... two <b>all-round</b> red <b>lights</b> or two {{balls in}} a {{vertical}} line {{to indicate the}} side on which the obstruction exists; ...|$|R
2500|$|... two <b>all-round</b> green <b>lights</b> or two {{diamonds}} in a vertical line {{to indicate the}} side on which another vessel may pass; ...|$|R
5000|$|... {{if it is}} {{narrower}} than 25 m, one <b>all-round</b> white <b>light</b> {{near the}} forward end (except {{if it is a}} dracone) and one near the after end; ...|$|R
5000|$|... {{when there}} is {{outlying}} gear extending more than 150 metres horizontally from the vessel, an <b>all-round</b> white <b>light</b> or a cone apex upwards {{in the direction of}} the gear; ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{hovercraft}} {{must also}} display an <b>all-round</b> flashing yellow <b>light.</b>|$|R
50|$|A vessel {{constrained}} by her draft may, {{in addition to}} the lights prescribed for power-driven vessels in Rule 23, exhibit where they can best be seen three <b>all-round</b> red <b>lights</b> in a vertical line, or a cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|A {{power-driven}} vessel of {{less than}} 12 m may display only an <b>all-round</b> white <b>light</b> and sidelights. However, {{in the case of}} a skiff a wooden clinker rowing boat which falls into this category only needs to be capable of showing a white light.|$|R
5000|$|A {{wing-in-ground craft}} must also display a bright <b>all-round</b> {{flashing}} red <b>light</b> when taking off, landing, or flying near the surface.|$|R
5000|$|... (f) A vessel {{engaged in}} mine {{clearance}} operations shall {{in addition to}} the lights prescribed for a power-driven vessel in Rule 23 or to the lights or shape prescribed for a vessel at anchor in Rule 30 as appropriate, exhibit three <b>all-round</b> green <b>lights</b> or three balls. One of these lights or shapes shall be exhibited near the foremast head and one {{at each end of the}} fore yard. These lights or shapes indicate that it is dangerous for another vessel to approach within 1000 m of the mine clearance vessel.|$|R
