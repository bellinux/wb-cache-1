50|$|Bonne is {{sometimes}} confused with Philip's biological aunt, also named Bonne (sister of John the Fearless, lived 1379-1399), {{in part due}} to the Papal Dispensation required for the marriage which made no distinction between <b>a</b> marital <b>aunt</b> and <b>a</b> biological <b>aunt.</b>|$|R

5|$|She {{was born}} in New York City. After her parents separated, she lived in Maryland with <b>an</b> <b>aunt</b> and uncle for several years.

5|$|As a boy, Jinnah {{lived for}} a time in Bombay with <b>an</b> <b>aunt</b> and may have {{attended}} the Gokal Das Tej Primary School there, later on studying at the Cathedral and John Connon School. In Karachi, he attended the Sindh-Madrasa-tul-Islam and the Christian Missionary Society High School. He gained his matriculation from Bombay University at the high school. In his later years and especially after his death, a large number of stories about the boyhood of Pakistan's founder were circulated: that he spent all his spare time at the police court, listening to the proceedings, and that he studied his books by the glow of street lights for lack of other illumination. His official biographer, Hector Bolitho, writing in 1954, interviewed surviving boyhood associates, and obtained a tale that the young Jinnah discouraged other children from playing marbles in the dust, urging them to rise up, keep their hands and clothes clean, and play cricket instead.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a family}} of African royalty, Massaquoi {{grew up in the}} care of <b>an</b> <b>aunt</b> in Njagbacca, in the Garwula District of Grand Cape Mount County of {{southern}} Liberia. After seven years, she returned to the northwestern part of the country in Montserrado County, where she began her schooling.

In 1937 she moved to the United States for further education, studying sociology and anthropology at Lane College, Fisk University and Boston University. While in the US, she collaborated on a dictionary of the Vai language and wrote her autobiography, though a legal battle ensued over the rights to her story. She won an injunction barring others from publishing and returned to Liberia in 1946, immediately beginning collaboration to establish a university there, which would become the University of Liberia.|$|E
50|$|David Wiffen {{was born}} in Redhill, Surrey, in 1942. He spent his early {{childhood}} with his mother,living on <b>an</b> <b>aunt's</b> farm in Chipstead, while his father, an engineer, contributed to the war effort.

50|$|His {{parents were}} Jose Moreno y Caloy (Pepe), a Spanish Filipino Mestizo, and Aurora Molina. He had one sister, Pilar Moreno Nite.

Apart from a nephew's natural {{interest}} in <b>an</b> <b>aunt's</b> refined weekly paper, I {{had always had}} a soft spot in my heart for Milady's Boudoir ever since I contributed that article to it on What the Well-Dressed Man is Wearing. Sentimental, possibly, but we old journalists do have these feelings.|$|R
5|$|Harrison and his wife, Caroline, {{returned}} {{to live at}} The Point, his father's farm in southeastern Ohio, while he finished his law studies. Harrison {{was admitted to the}} Ohio bar in early 1854, the same year he sold property that he had inherited after the death of <b>an</b> <b>aunt</b> for $800 and used the funds to move with Caroline to Indianapolis, Indiana. Harrison began practicing law in the office of John H. Ray in 1854 and became a crier for the federal court in Indianapolis, for which he was paid $2.50 per day. He also served as a Commissioner for the U.S. Court of Claims. Harrison became a founding member and first president of both the University Club, a private gentlemen's club in Indianapolis, and the Phi Delta Theta Alumni Club. Harrison and his wife became members and assumed leadership positions at Indianapolis's First Presbyterian Church.|$|E
5|$|His {{introduction}} to films was unusual. When visiting <b>an</b> <b>aunt</b> {{who lived in}} Brooklyn opposite Vitagraph Studios, Cagney would climb over the fence to watch the filming of John Bunny movies. He became involved in amateur dramatics, starting as a scenery boy for a Chinese pantomime at Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, {{one of the first}} settlement houses in the nation, where his brother Harry performed and his soon-to-be friend, Florence James, directed. He was initially content working behind the scenes and had no interest in performing. One night, however, Harry became ill, and although Cagney was not an understudy, his photographic memory of rehearsals enabled him to stand in for his brother without making a single mistake. Therefore, Florence James has the unique distinction of being the first director to put him on a stage. Afterward, he joined a number of companies as a performer in a variety of roles.|$|E
5|$|In January 1956 Hope {{recorded}} with another rising star, Jackie McLean, for the saxophonist's Lights Out! In April {{of the same}} year Hope should have appeared on saxophonist Gene Ammons' The Happy Blues, but he left the record company's building before the session began and did not return. Hope claimed that he had gone to visit <b>an</b> <b>aunt</b> in hospital, but his absence was attributed by others to his heroin addiction. This had existed on and off for several years, and had led to at least one spell in prison. His drug problem and associated criminal record led to the withdrawal of Hope's New York City Cabaret Card around 1956, so he was no longer permitted to play in clubs in the city.|$|E
