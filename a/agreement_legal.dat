40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} behavioural patterns of international partnerships {{differ from those}} of domestic partnerships. For this purpose, we use a sample of partnerships established between 1990 and 2002 in which any Spanish company listed on the Spanish continuous market has participated. We find that the number of international partnerships has grown over this period. Spanish companies enter into agreements primarily to expand their activities abroad, although on occasion they serve as a bridge for foreign companies to penetrate the Spanish market. We contrast a set of exploratory hypotheses regarding the relationship between the types of partnerships and their main characteristics: number of partners, functional area, nature of the <b>agreement,</b> <b>legal</b> form, nature of the partners, sector to which they belong, etc. Our results indicate that, in most cases, there is a relationship between the type of partnership and these variables, which points to a differential behaviour of international partnerships...|$|E

This research was an empirical study based on primary data. Analysis {{used in the}} study was qualitative analysis and methods used to infer this study were inductive and deductive methods. Based on the findings, soccer players who signed the working agreement with PSS Sleman, their rights had been protected jurisdictionally as mentioned in the <b>agreement.</b> <b>Legal</b> protection for injured player was already stated in the agreement and its addendums which could not be alienated from the agreement between PSS Sleman and its players. However, as employees, the players were not signed up in workers social security (Jaminan Sosial Tenaga Kerja - Jamsostek) program since all accidents that were put the players at risk had been assured by PSS Sleman. In this case, PSS Sleman does not act in accordance with the law on workers social security. Even so, PSS Sleman provides a protection for its players as stated in the working agreement. This situation did not affect to the players' performance since the assurance provided by PSS as stated in the agreement made the players tended to feel secured from anything that could risk their safety in doing their work. To assure legal protection for the players, they should be registered in Jamsostek program, even though, practically, their safety rights were insured in the working agreement.

40|$|Code River or Kali Code {{is one of}} {{the great}} rivers that divide the city of Yogyakarta. We found that the {{community}} in the Code riverside needs something that can improve their welfare significantly. We try to figure out something that combines some potential resources like fish conservation, waste-free area of Kali Code, unique architecture, and English speaking people. We come up with the suggestion of a Service-Learning (S-L) program to create a fishing river. The aim of this S-L program is to have a multidisciplinary and multicultural approach to improve the Kali Code community’s welfare through environmental natural resources utilization. Internal coordination is important to organize all S-L participants while we begin to survey Kali Code. There will be a step-by-step method that involves participants that are expert in their field, so the participants (community, local government, university students, foundation, and NGO) can focus and be responsible for each section but still support the others. In this S-L program, the involvement of the community is the main priority and the sustainability of this program is important. There are nine steps to make this fishing river into reality: survey, licensing <b>agreement,</b> <b>legal</b> establishment, fishing river construction, fingerlings and material provision, infrastructure development, branding and promotion, guide service coordination, and sustainable development. The main problems of this S-L program are how to consolidate and share the profit wisely. Basically, the community should realize that this S-L program aims for everyone’s prosperity, not just for individual benefit. That is why creating a legal establishment is very important. We believe that this fishing river will impact the community’s welfare. Moreover, the Kali Code community must keep their environment clean. In the future, this S-L program can carry on to other communities and involve local and overseas university students and lecturers. Hopefully, by creating a fishing river, Kali Code can be better known nationally and even internationally, and the community can improve their quality of life...|$|E

I argue that the application of Chapter 19 imposes a number of unwarranted limitations on several of the constitutional rights of the parties to a surrogacy agreement. In addition, I propose that Chapter 19 is not {{in accordance with the}} principal of {{the best interests of the}} child. I examine the history of surrogate motherhood in South Africa and establish that, prior to the enactment of Chapter 19, no legislation expressly afforded surrogate motherhood <b>agreements</b> <b>legal</b> recognition. Hence, prior to the enactment of Chapter 19, parties who entered surrogacy agreements could, first, not rely on the agreement to enforce contractual obligations, and secondly, the legal positions of the parties to the agreement were uncertain. Thirdly, a child born of a surrogacy agreement was seen as the child of the surrogate mother and not of the commissioning parents. South Afric...|$|R
