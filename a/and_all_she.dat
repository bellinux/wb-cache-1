Before Sultan Mahmud can kill his own son, Gusti Putri stops him, declaring that the conditions were a rejection <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> wants is to live on Gunung Ledang in peace.

500|$|The {{focus of}} most reviews {{was in the}} climactic final scene, whose {{directing}} and acting is universally acclaimed by critics. Writing for Cultural Learnings, Myles McNutt stated: [...] "the final shot, with Arya looking to the sky as everything goes to silence <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> sees is the birds flying was just wonderfully haunting. Alan Taylor's direction sold both the chaos and the resignation of that moment." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall felt that [...] "that final scene was so gorgeously shot, and the weariness of Bean's performance and the horror of Maisie Williams' so perfectly conveyed the emotions of it, even as things seemed so chaotic." ...|$|E

500|$|As a final {{tribute to}} Pauline and Wendy Richard, the BBC aired a special {{television}} programme, EastEnders Revealed: Goodbye Pauline, which provided an emotional {{look back at}} Pauline's pivotal storylines during her time in Walford. It also reunited Wendy Richard with prior cast-mates Todd Carty and James Alexandrou (Mark and Martin respectively), and featured character commentary and tributes from television critics and EastEnders actors such as Anna Wing and Pam St. Clement (Lou and Pat). During the programme—which aired on New Year's Day, 2007—Wendy Richard reflected upon how [...] "proud" [...] she was of her character, commenting: [...] "Pauline had everything in life thrown at her and I think she coped with it very well. It showed how people deal with their problems... She wasn't always grumpy... she did have lots of laughs, but sadly people don't seem to remember that, which is a shame... they still harp on about her wearing her cardigans and Pauline stopped wearing cardigans three years after EastEnders started. She is a good woman, she's a kind woman, a loving woman <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> ever thought about was her family. That {{was the most important}} thing in her life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nancy {{does not}} tell Darren that she is helping Mitzeee, which Fox told a {{reporter}} from What's on TV is because [...] "Darren is so focused on the baby that if she told him he'd be really angry. Nancy feels he doesn't understand the relationship she has with Mitzeee and he hasn't been terribly supportive". When questioned if Nancy feels her involvement with Mitzeee may place strain on the baby, Fox answered: [...] "At the moment she feels incredibly tired, but she's sure that everything's fine <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> {{needs to do is}} focus on her friend". Darren discovers Nancy is helping Mitzeee, making him [...] "absolutely furious" [...] as he can not believe Nancy is [...] "going against the law, is running around and getting stressed - especially while she's heavily pregnant". When urged to put their child first by Darren, Nancy dismisses him as she believes he is [...] "just being silly". Fox said that [...] "Nancy thinks she knows best, as Nancy always does", adding that Nancy is [...] "a bit like a dog with a bone. If she's decided that she's going to do something, it's very difficult to change her mind".|$|E
2500|$|By her own admission, {{she was not}} {{a success}} at first. [...] She only made about $25 during her first month, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> could afford for her office was two chairs and a {{borrowed}} typewriter. [...] As she told a reporter in a 1934 interview, [...] "I had no clients. And I had no money. [...] But I had great hopes." [...] However, in order to become successful, what she needed was some experience, so she did volunteer work with the local Legal Aid Society, where she not only got that experience but got involved with an important case about suffrage. [...] As a child, her mother had taken her to see famous suffragists Susan B. Anthony and Anna Howard Shaw giving talks about women's rights. [...] And the belief that women should be treated as equals under the law undoubtedly resonated with her even more {{as a result of her}} struggles to be taken seriously as an attorney. [...] She became even more interested in politics, and more committed to the cause of women's suffrage. [...] She was active in the Women's Suffrage Party and began challenging local laws that limited women's participation in the political process. And she argued one particular case that went all the way to the Ohio Supreme Court: thanks to her efforts, she won the women of East Cleveland the right to vote in municipal elections. [...] During this time, she also became involved in another cause, one that would be important to her all of her life: [...] disarmament and the quest for world peace. [...] For Allen, this was personal: [...] both of her brothers died while serving their country during the First World War.|$|E
