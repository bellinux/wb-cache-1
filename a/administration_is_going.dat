A neutral, independent, not for profit association called Global Off-Grid Lighting Association (GOGLA) was conceived out of a joint World Bank/IFC Lighting Africa and private sector effort in 2012. India is the first Asian lighting programs for IFC. Lighting Asia/India program was planned to enable access of two million rural Indians to off-grid lighting solutions by 2015. The program is designed with a series of interventions to alter market behavior by removing specific barriers, for example, the market spoilage created by poor products, lack of information on quality products and on distribution channels, lack of financing for companies and consumers, lack of awareness that quality solar appliances are affordable and viableIndia's first smart village has been developed by Eco Needs Foundation http://www.econeeds.org/ at Dhanora village of Rajasthan. The concept is prepared by Prof. Priyanand Agale, Dr. Satyapal Singh Meena an officer of Indian Revenue Service(IRS) http://epaper.bhaskar.com/detail/1202310/52621824785/0/map/tabs-1/05-26-2017/14/6/image/ and Mr. Attdeep Agale. This concept consists of five elements Retrofitting, Redevelopment, Greenfield, e-Pan and Livelihood. Under the project of smart village the Foundation is adopting villages and putting efforts for sustainable development by providing basic amenities like sanitation, safe drinking water, internal road, tree plantation, water conservation. The Foundation is also working for inculcating moral values in the society and for improving the standard of living of the villagers. The Foundation has developed Village Dhanora, Teh. Bari, District Dholpur, one of the remotely situated village of Rajasthan as India’s First Smart Village. The village is situated 30 km away from Dholpur district head quarter and 248 Km from Jaipur city, Capital of Rajasthan State of India. The population of the village was nearly about 2000 having no sanitation facility, potable water facility, which were adversely causing the health of the villagers. The internal roads are also not there and it causes great hardship to the people especially in rainy season. Owing to unawareness and non-availability of sanitation facility and toilets the people of the village use to go open for defecation. There are other problems also which villagers were facing such as Fluoride concentration in drinking water, No water conservation System, Encroachment on the roads, Electrical power fluctuation No outcome base education, Unemployment and poverty. ProF. Priyanand Agale Founder, president of Foundation and Dr. Satyapal Singh Meena officer of the Indian Revenue service has converted this village as India's first Smart Village and now Dhanora has become a role model of Rural Development. Following are the major success achieved within a short span of two years of the project and project is still underway:1. Construction of 822 toilets in the Panchayat area with the help of district administration and public participation accordingly, the Dhanora Gram Panchayat has been declared as the first “Open Defecation Free” (ODF) Panchayat by District Administration.2. Village Dhanora become India’s first village having sewerage line with treatment plant. The Foundation has laid down nearly 2 Km long sewerage line of diameter 450 mm in the village. Each of the toilets of Dhanora village have been connected to sewerage line with inspection chambers.3. Construction of nearly 2 Km long cement concrete internal roads constructed with 3.5 m to 4.5 m width with high quality.4. Construction of eight Percolation tank connecting with nearly 2.5 Km artificial channel of 10 feet in width and 10 feet in depth for water conservation and ground water recharge with public participation {{and with the help of}} government having groundwater recharge capacity of 97.49 Million liters in one time recharge, which will provide irrigation facility to farms of the village and nearby villages resulting into economic growth of farmers.5. The work of the removal of encroachments and road widening has been completed without using any police force. Now the whole village is having motorable road in the village.6. Construction of nearly 2 km approach road at Dhodekapura village of the Dhanora Panchayat, which was not done in last 65 years.7. The police <b>Administration</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to declare the village as “APRADH MUKKTA GAON” (Crime Free Village), no case or FIR in Police Station.8. village Dhanora has been converted into an Art gallery. The paintings in the village are spreading social awareness among villagers 9. The foundation stone for community centre and information centre has been laid down, work under progress.

The analysis of these inconsistencies and discontinuities makes possible to reconstruct the peculiar relationship among statistical methods, administrative procedures and the behaviour of surveyed individuals, which emerged in a specific urban context.

40|$|The {{mixed economy}} {{of the welfare state}} armed with the new science of public <b>administration</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to {{eradicate}} poverty. But it hasn't and the policy influence of the idea of poverty has fallen away. I explain this by looking at the conditions under which good ideas are likely to make it to policy status. Good ideas tend to be simple to understand; resonate with people's experiences of life; have leadership and a policy community around them; fit into program and resource structures of governments and seem capable of solving immediate problems. The idea of eradicating poverty has lost these features. For example, for the past 20 years poverty ideas have been knocked off their perch by economic reform ideas. Not only are there these competing economic ideas (which are claimed to be a solution to poverty), there is also a raft of new social capital ideas making claims on policy resources. The idea of poverty has been obfuscated such that we can't agree what it means any more or how to measure it or who is responsible for tackling it. Which, of course, means no one can be held accountable. Out of the muddle I suggest a way forward to make the idea influential again. For example, having some national goals and agreeing some basic language and targets would be a good start...|$|R

Further, at least at Iowa State University, each incoming president 2 ̆ 7 s in-augural address has involved an explanation of the land-grant idea. In the past three decades, that explanation has devolved from the broad view, held for a century, that land-grant colleges should prepare their students to be productive economically and politically, that they should educate them to be competent engineers and agriculturists as well as civic-minded people capable of acting not just in someone 2 ̆ 7 s private interest, but in their commu-nity 2 ̆ 7 s - their polity 2 ̆ 7 s - public interest. The latest presidents of Iowa State have, since the 1980 s, put forward an explanation of the land-grant idea that places economic values, rather than politi-cal values, at the center of the university 2 ̆ 7 s existence. The work of historians of agriculture and the land-grant colleges has not been much better, the former paying little attention to the land-grant colleges and the latter more often than not failing to see the larger context in which the col-leges were created and have existed. This thesis investigates the ideology that played a role in Iowa State University 2 ̆ 7 s creation in the late 1850 s and early 1860 s as the Iowa State Agricultural College and Model Farm. In the mid- to late 1850 s, acting out of a concern for declining soil fertility (or the potential for it), the Iowa State Agricultural Society formulated an ideology of sustainable land use, scientific inves-tigation of farming techniques, and the equal dignity of labor (agricultural and mechanical work) with the more esteemed professions. The Society turned to a number of educational institutions, including annual fairs, agricultural periodicals, seed distribution programs by the federal govern-ment, township-level farmers 2 ̆ 7 clubs, the state geological survey, and the state agricultural college, chartered in 1858, before the Morrill Act 2 ̆ 7 s passage. The author undertook this thesis because he believes that, if Iowa State 2 ̆ 7 s <b>administration</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to invoke the history of the Morrill Act to rationalize their actions, they ought to know what that history is...|$|R
