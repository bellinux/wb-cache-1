40|$|Abstract: The {{seasonal}} {{variations in the}} physico-chemical parameters of Pindavani pond of central India, located near Bhadrawati town of Chandrapur district of Maharashtra state was studied from October 2005 to September 2007. The parameters that were determined included temperature, pH, transparency, conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), free carbon dioxide, alkalinity, hardness (calcium, magnesium), chloride, biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and phosphate, sulphate and nitrate concentrations. In the present investigation, the atmospheric temperature {{was found to be}} higher than the water temperature and as expected, the maximum water temperature was recorded <b>during</b> <b>the</b> summer <b>and</b> minimum <b>during</b> <b>the</b> winter season. Maximum transparency was recorded <b>during</b> winter <b>and</b> minimum <b>during</b> <b>the</b> monsoon season, while maximum conductivity, pH and BOD were recorded <b>during</b> summer <b>and</b> minimum <b>during</b> <b>the</b> monsoon season. Free carbon dioxide, total hardness, calcium and magnesium hardness, chemical oxygen demand and phosphate and sulphate concentration were maximum <b>during</b> summers <b>and</b> minimum <b>during</b> <b>the</b> winter season while DO and chloride showed <b>the</b> maximum levels <b>during</b> <b>the</b> summer <b>and</b> minimum <b>during</b> <b>the</b> monsoon season. Alkalinity and nitrate showed maximum level <b>during</b> <b>the</b> monsoon <b>and</b> minimum <b>during</b> <b>the</b> winter season. The comparative higher value of conductivity, total alkalinity, chloride, phosphate and nitrate in Pindavani pond indicates its contaminated status...|$|R
