Also, Blu and Jewel's old nemesis, Nigel the cockatoo, has survived the plane crash from the first film, but he is now unable to fly and is working as a fortune teller/con artist. When he sees Blu and his family flying overhead, he immediately decides to seek revenge on them. He enlists two minions to help him in his plans; a silent anteater named Charlie and a poison dart frog named Gabi, who is in love with Nigel. Blu and his family use a boat to get to the jungle (with Nigel's first plan of revenge being inadvertently foiled by Charlie); and, when they arrive, they find nothing. However, they are eventually taken to a flock of blue macaws that are hiding in a secret paradise land. There, they meet Jewel's stern long-lost father, Eduardo, his older sister Mimi, and Jewel's childhood friend, Roberto. Eduardo seems unimpressed with Blu's domesticated human behavior.|$|E

The music shop was designed in the Victorian architecture style, while the warehouse was constructed at AVM Productions with the fight sequence being filmed there as well. Filming of another action sequence in an open-air theatre, which was also designed by Tharani, took place for approximately 15-20 days. K. V.

40|$|Learning {{directly}} from natural human move-ments provides {{an alternative to}} inefficient and sometimes infeasible kinesthetic teach-ing. In particular, {{in the field of}} robotic co-workers, flexible approaches to obtain collab-orative trajectories becomes important, not only to <b>avoid</b> <b>disruptions</b> in the production cycle, but also because of the repetitive and abundant number of human movements that occur, for example, during an assembly task. This project aims to find such collaborative trajectories by using an inverse kinematics based approach. The solution must be op-timal with respect to accuracy at which the original demonstration can be reproduced, joint limits and efficiency in human robot collaboration. Furthermore, the flexibility of the algorithm with respect to different workspaces is evaluated. The results indicate that the algorithm is capable to adapt natu-ral human demonstrations that take place in arbitrary locations, to the embodiment of a 7 -DoF robotic arm in different types of tasks. ...|$|E

A number of organizational dynamics can derail this project, however, especially at the transnational level. In the author’s case studies of a U.

In the United States, the discourse of gender is more legitimate, whereas in India, it is eth-nicity/race. These discourses of diversity have both positive and negative implications. They are used by managers to divert attention from overt forms of stratification and <b>avoid</b> <b>disruptions</b> in employee relations, yet they also generate a mutual critique between the two firms that can help to overcome the filtering process and achieve a more integrated understanding of discrimination...|$|E

40|$|Rerouting for a {{circuit-switched}} wavelength-division-multiplexed {{all-optical network}} is considered in this paper. Due to the wavelength continuity constraint, a new connection may be blocked even if bandwidth is available between {{the origin and}} the destination. Rerouting can make the available bandwidth wavelength-continuous by changing the routes of certain existing connections to accommodate the new connection. To <b>avoid</b> <b>disruptions</b> of existing connections, Move-To-Vacant Wavelength-Retuning (MTV_WR) is proposed as the basic operation of circuit migration, in which a circuit is moved to a vacant wavelength on the same path, and the Parallel MTV_WR rerouting scheme is considered to reroute multiple circuits on disjoint sets of links. We design the optimal algorithm which minimizes the weighted number of rerouted circuits with the Parallel MTV_WR rerouting scheme. Numerical results using simulation show that rerouting can effectively reduce the blocking probability due to the wavelength continuity constraint while minimizing the incurred disruptions. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

We show how to improve significantly the decision-making process in a Brazilian petroleum company using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to represent COSP. Comparison tests with a current ship-scheduling method adopted in the company indicated that the use of the MILP model increased the transportation efficiency and reduced costs by 20 % on average. In addition to the quantitative gains, the use of a MILP model to solve COSP has succeeded when encountering real-life events, such as variation in production or consumption rates, berth unavailability, and changes in the storage capacities at ports...|$|E
