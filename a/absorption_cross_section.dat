Analysis in this work addresses discrepancies in ozone gas <b>absorption</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> in relation to the temperature in the visible spectrum; thus, the results can be applied to get optimal configuration of high accuracy ozone gas sensors...|$|R

Therefore, in D2O with natural oxygen, 21% of neutron captures are on oxygen, rising higher as 17O builds up from neutron capture on 16O. Also, 17O may emit an alpha particle on neutron capture, producing radioactive carbon-14.|$|E
25|$|Casting {{and then}} {{machining}} plutonium is difficult {{not only because}} of its toxicity, but also because plutonium has many different metallic phases. As plutonium cools, changes in phase result in distortion and cracking. This distortion is normally overcome by alloying it with 30-35 mMol (0.9–1.0% by weight) gallium, forming a plutonium-gallium alloy, which causes it to take up its delta phase over a wide temperature range. When cooling from molten it then has only a single phase change, from epsilon to delta, instead of the four changes it would otherwise pass through. Other trivalent metals would also work, but gallium has a small neutron <b>absorption</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> and helps protect the plutonium against corrosion. A drawback is that gallium compounds are corrosive and so if the plutonium is recovered from dismantled weapons for conversion to plutonium dioxide for power reactors, there is the difficulty of removing the gallium.|$|E

500|$|Instead, Goeppert became {{interested}} in physics, and chose to pursue a Ph.D. In her 1930 doctoral thesis she worked out the theory of possible two-photon absorption by atoms.

500|$|Liquid sodium {{is used as}} a heat {{transfer}} fluid in some types of nuclear reactors because it has the high thermal conductivity and low neutron <b>absorption</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> required to achieve a high neutron flux in the reactor. The high boiling point of sodium allows the reactor to operate at ambient (normal) pressure, but the drawbacks include its opacity, which hinders visual maintenance, and its explosive properties. Radioactive sodium-24 may be produced by neutron bombardment during operation, posing a slight radiation hazard; the radioactivity stops within a few days after removal from the reactor. If a reactor needs to be shut down frequently, NaK is used; because NaK is a liquid at room temperature, the coolant does not solidify in the pipes. In this case, the pyrophoricity of potassium requires extra precautions to prevent and detect leaks. [...] Another {{heat transfer}} application is poppet valves in high-performance internal combustion engines; the valve stems are partially filled with sodium and work as a heat pipe to cool the valves.|$|E

We present a rigorous method to determine these <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> using transient <b>absorption</b> (TA) measurements. We apply the method to CdSe quantum dots (QDs) and core–shell (CdSe) ZnS QDs. The method involves measuring TA dynamics for various excitation intensities over a broad time range and analyzing the experiments in terms of a kinetic multiexciton model taking into account all contributions to the signal. In this way, we were able to quantify exciton and multiexciton <b>absorption</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> at different spectral positions. The <b>absorption</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> decrease with increasing number of excitations, qualitatively in agreement with the state-filling effective mass model but showing a slower decrease.

40|$|In {{the deep}} burn {{research}} of Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR), it is desired {{to make an}} accurate estimation of <b>absorption</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> and <b>absorption</b> rates in burnable poison (BP) pins. However, in traditional methods, multi-group <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> are generated from single bundle calculations with specular reflection boundary condition, in which the energy spectral effect in the core environment is not taken into account. This approximation introduces errors to the <b>absorption</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> especially for BPs neighboring reflectors and control rods. In order to correct the BP <b>absorption</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> in whole core diffusion calculations, energy spectrum reconstruction (ESR) methods {{have been developed to}} reconstruct the fine group spectrum (and in-core continuous energy spectrum). Then, using the reconstructed spectrum as boundary condition, a BP pin cell local transport calculation serves an imbedded module within the whole core diffusion code to iteratively correct the BP <b>absorption</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> for improved results. The ESR methods were tested in a 2 D prismatic High Temperature Reactor (HTR) problem. The reconstructed fine-group spectra have shown good agreement with the reference spectra. Comparing with the <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> calculated by single block calculation with specular reflection boundary conditions, the BP <b>absorption</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> are effectively improved by ESR methods. A preliminary study was also performed to extend the ESR methods to a 2 D Pebble Bed Reactor (PBR) problem. The results demonstrate that the ESR can reproduce the energy spectra on the fuel-outer reflector interface accurately. M. S.
