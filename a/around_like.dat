In the family Philopotamidae, the nets are sac-like, with intricate structure and tiny mesh. The larvae have specialised mouthparts to scrape off the microflora that get trapped in the net as water flows through.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Duncan Wood, the BBC's Head of Comedy, {{watched a}} comedy on {{television}} called The Misfit. Impressed by writer Roy Clarke's ability to inject both comedy and drama into the sitcom, Wood offered Clarke {{the opportunity to}} write a sitcom. Clarke nearly turned the job down as {{he felt that the}} BBC's idea for a programme about three old men was a dull concept for a half-hour sitcom. Instead, Clarke proposed that the men should all be unmarried, widowed, or divorced and either unemployed or retired, leaving them free to roam <b>around</b> <b>like</b> adolescents in the prime of their lives, unfettered and uninhibited.|$|E

25|$|Jim Crawford, a {{policeman}} then aged 23, and Herb Jones, a contractor, were credited with saving {{as many as}} 50 lives between {{the start of the}} heavy flooding during the late evening until daybreak. Crawford supplied gas for Jones' boat, and they set out into the river, which flooded as high as the telephone wires.

She shouts for Kohta {{to make it so}} that she will not become a zombie and cause pain to others around her. Kohta kills her and later finds himself in shock, but he is set straight by Shizuka, who uses a psychology trick of ordering him <b>around</b> <b>like</b> a sergeant.|$|E
25|$|As {{the number}} of prisoners at the camp {{increased}} {{in the summer of}} 1864, the War Department again reduced rations, in retaliation for the Confederates reducing rations for Union prisoners. Rations reportedly no longer lasted quite as long as the period for which they were allotted. A few prisoners reported that prisoners resorted to eating rats. Guards punished anyone caught taking bones from the garbage by tying the bone in the prisoner's mouth and making him crawl <b>around</b> <b>like</b> a dog. As the length of confinements increased {{due to the lack of}} prisoner exchanges, more fights between prisoners arose. Other prisoners usually broke them up before guards intervened.

25|$|The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Regiments {{participated in}} the Battle of Prairie Grove under their state designations. It is {{asserted}} that Col. Charles W. Adams treated his regiment of conscripts more like prisoners than soldiers, with the men being held under guard and herded <b>around</b> <b>like</b> cattle, for example. The regiment spent the morning of December 7 near Prairie Grove church facing south. At about {{three o'clock in the}} afternoon it was ordered into the fight. Upon reaching Battle Ridge, the regiment was placed in a gap between Fagan's Brigade and Shelby's Brigade behind the south fence of the Borden orchard. The regiment fired a volley from behind the fence toward {{the right wing of the}} Twenty-sixth Indiana. When the Hoosiers fell back the regiment climbed over the fence and advanced north through the orchard (which was filled with fearfully mangled Union and Confederate corpses from an earlier clash) directly toward the Borden house. At approximately the place where the modern tour road crosses the orchard the regiment ran into a storm of fire from the left wing of the Thirty-seventh Illinois, including the left flank company which was armed with Colt revolving rifles. That is when the regiment broke. As both Adams and Hindman noted in their reports, many of the company officers went with the men.|$|E

The film received predominantly negative reviews from critics, but with a total collection of , it proved to be a commercial success.

[...] Tom Ewing from The Guardian noted the song bears similarities to Rihanna's [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] (2010). Genevieve Koski from The A.V. Club wrote that on the song, [...] "Jennifer Hudson manage to keep [...] head above the waves of synths...by amping up [...] vocals to match the outsized beats."

In May 1820, his mother described Ernest as [...] "very big for his age, as well as intelligent. His big black eyes are full of spirit and vivacity". Biographer Richard Hough writes that [...] "even from their infancy, it was plainly evident that the elder son took after his father, in character and appearance, while Albert strongly resembled his mother in most respects". Ernest and his brother often lived with their grandmother the Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld until her death in 1831.|$|E
