40|$|Concentrations of {{dimethylsulphide}} (DMS) and dissolved and particulate {{pools of}} its precursor, dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP), were surveyed {{at the time}} of the summer bloom of coccolithophores in the Northeast Atlantic. The average DMS concentration was 12 nmol dm- 3 (n = 158, range 1. 06 - 93. 8 nmol dm- 3, sn - 1 = 12. 4). Statistically significant positive correlations between particulate DMSP and chlorophyll were found for samples from areas where coccolithophores accounted for 50 % or more of the total carbon biomass. In these areas correlations between DMS and chlorophyll were not as strong but still significant. An estimate of the flux of DMS from the Northeast Atlantic in June–July (721 nmol m- 2 h- 1) is of the same order as estimates for the southern North Sea at the same time of year (646 nmol m- 2 h- 1). The data provide strong evidence for the importance of coccolithophores in the emission of DMS to the atmosphere. Comparison of flux data with budgets for <b>airborne</b> <b>sulphur</b> in Europe, reported by the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP), suggests that in summer the Northeast Atlantic may be a source of the sulphur deposited on adjacent land areas not strongly affected by anthropogenic sulphur sources. The overall results are discussed in relation to present knowledge of the global distribution of coccolithophores...|$|E
50|$|The State Line Power Plant's age {{meant that}} it was not fitted with many of the {{pollution}} control equipment that is mandated on more modern generating plants. Instead, State Line's operations were grandfathered, giving the plant the right to vent nitrogen oxides, <b>airborne</b> mercury, and <b>sulphur</b> dioxide into the air. According to a September 2010 article in the Chicago Tribune, the State Line Power Plant was described {{as one of the greatest}} single point-source contributors to the Chicago area's ongoing noncompliant status under the Clean Air Act.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Deposition and {{concentrations}} of nitrogen and sulphur compounds, calculated with the model Hilatar over the resent years, are presented. The model structure, performance {{and development of}} its parameterization schemes are shortly reviewed. Model applications in estimating background area pollutant concentrations and depositions since 2000 and with simultaneous development of emissions, as well as trends in the airborne NOX load to the Baltic Sea {{and the effect of}} the specific AIS ship emission and North-West Russian emission inventories in comparison with use of EMEP emissions are discussed. Key words: <b>airborne</b> deposition, nitrogen, <b>sulphur,</b> regional modelling...|$|R
40|$|The Swedish Government has {{commissioned}} the Swedish Maritime Administration {{to assess the}} consequences of the new rules for <b>airborne</b> emissions of <b>sulphur</b> dioxide and nitrogen oxides from maritime transport, adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in October 2008. On behalf of the Swedish Maritime Administration, the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI) has shed light on whether the IMO's more stringent emission requirements in the SOx Emission Control Area (SECA - covering the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, and the English Channel), will lead to transfer of freight transport from maritime to other modes of transport. Model calculations have been made with the aid of the new national Samgods logistics model Version 2. 0 for three of the alternatives examined by the Swedish Maritime Administration...|$|R
40|$|Air {{pollutants}} {{have been}} associated {{with a wide variety of}} adverse health effects in children. A description of the impact of air pollutants on children's health is complicated by the presence of many types of air pollution and by the variety of indicators of adverse health effects. Over the period April-September 1994, the frequency of emergency room visits for asthma, bronchitis, laryngitis and bronchiolitis in the Paediatrics Department in Padua (Italy) has been documented and compared to outdoor concentrations of <b>airborne</b> particulate, <b>sulphur</b> dioxide (SO 2), nitrogen oxides (NO(x)) and ozone in a case-control study. Two control groups of children affected by air pollution not related diseases (acute gastro-enteritis or cranial trauma) have been considered. Atmospheric airborne particulate, SO 2, NO(x) and ozone concentrations were obtained from the Air Quality Monitoring Network of Padua. Statistical analysis was performed by multiple logistic step-wise regression. A total of 468 emergency room visits were noted; 139 children suffering from respiratory symptoms and 339 controls. The highest pollution levels were observed for ozone, with average 24 hr - concentrations, ranging from 30 to 160 mcg per cubic meter, still lower than permitted limits. No significant relationships could be found between any of the pollution indices and the incidence of emergency room visits for respiratory symptoms. No difference related to air pollutants was found between daily frequency of visits between cases and controls. Only bronchiolitis in the age < 2 years was related to the concentrations of NO 2 (p < 0. 05). In conclusion, short-term exposure to moderately high levels of photochemical air pollution did not result in clear acute respiratory adverse effects in children...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn 2008 the International Maritime Organization (IMO) {{decided on}} more {{stringent}} requirements from 2015 for <b>airborne</b> emissions of <b>sulphur</b> dioxide from sea transports in the sulphur emission control areas (SECA). The European SECA comprises the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel. The paper contains {{an overview of}} the European studies that have been carried out to investigate the impacts of IMO's more stringent sulphur requirements. All studies were carried out after IMO's decision in 2008 (which means that the decision was taken based on other reasons). The studies focus on different aspects but all of them estimate how IMO's stricter requirements will affect the sea transport costs. The Swedish impact studies are described in particular: in the 2009 study the national transport model Samgods was used and in 2013 both the Samgods model and the agent-based simulation model Tapas. Impacts on the choice of transport chains, routes and ports are calculated. The results indicate that shippers to some extent can reduce the increase in transport cost by transferring flows from the Swedish east coast to the Swedish south and west coast, the Norwegian coast and the land-based route via Denmark. Modal back shifts from sea to rail and road occur. These shifts are modest, especially if higher prices for diesel and higher rail track fees are assumed on top of more stringent sulphur requirements in the SECA. One important question is to what extent the increases in costs that are due to more stringent requirements can be compensated for by improved efficiency of the transports, such as the exploitation of economies of scale...|$|R
40|$|Studies are {{reported}} on two small lakes at Sudbury, Ontario located {{close to a}} nickel-copper smelter which closed in 1972. At that stage, Baby Lake had a pH of 4. 0 - 4. 2 while the adjacent Alice Lake had a pH 5. 9 - 6. 3. Both lakes were almost entirely devoid of algae and had neither Zooplankton nor fish. Soon after {{the closure of the}} smelter, with its large <b>airborne</b> volume of <b>sulphur</b> dioxide and of copper and nickel containing particulates, the chemistry of the lakes began to change. By 1985, Baby Lake had changed from pH 4. 0 to 6. 8 and is now at pH 7. 2. The pH of Alice Lake increased from a low of 5. 9 in the early 1970 s to 6. 9 - 7. 4 in the mid 1980 s and is now at 7. 3. Copper and nickel concentrations also decreased in both lakes during this period. The first biota found in the lakes in the post-smelter stage in the early 1980 s were benthic red chironomids, planktonic rotifers, and a limited number of phytoplankton species, of which Rhizosolenia was the most common. By the 1990 s, 13 phytoplankton species were present in each lake, with a substantial Zooplankton fauna (14 species) of rotifers, copepods, and cladocerans. There are now numerous insect larvae in the sediment and some small fish in both lakes. The biological recovery, which followed substantial reductions in acidity and in soluble nickel and copper concentrations in the waters, is a slower process than chemical recovery and is initially characterized by the dominance of a few species. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers...|$|R
