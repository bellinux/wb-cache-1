The study drew on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Maryland statistical reports. The gain is attributable to savings in expenditures on means-tested public benefit programs {{and an increase in}} sales and lodging tax revenue from weddings and wedding-related tourism.|$|E

5|$|The 2011 census {{revealed}} that the borough of Ashford saw the largest population growth in Kent, with records showing a 14.6% rise to 118,000 inhabitants. In 2012, Ashford Borough Council predicted there would be <b>a</b> <b>net</b> <b>gain</b> <b>of</b> 620 jobs per year. The increase in the town's commercial importance, {{as well as its}} strategic location, is witnessed by the number of industry, business and retail parks in the town.

5|$|St. Louis Cardinals Pro Bowl rookie Vai Sikahema tied an NFL {{record by}} {{returning}} two punts for touchdowns as the Buccaneers clinched the NFL's worst {{record for the}} second consecutive year. Frank Garcia, playing with a back injury, had a third punt blocked for <b>a</b> <b>net</b> <b>gain</b> <b>of</b> 1 yard. The Buccaneers scored first, on a 1-yard Bobby Howard run, but the Cardinals' 21 unanswered points gave them the lead for good before halftime. A 33-yard touchdown pass from Steve Young to Phil Freeman brought the Buccaneers to within 4 points in the third quarter. The game not only ended a futile season for the Buccaneers, but also concluded the Cardinals' worst season since moving to St. Louis 27 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|The Ohio Department of Development {{estimates}} {{that there are}} 555 motor vehicle production establishments in Ohio, and that by employing around 138,000 people, Ohio motor vehicle production employees account for 12.7% of the United States' motor vehicle production employees.
