The study drew on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Maryland statistical reports. The gain is attributable to savings in expenditures on means-tested public benefit programs {{and an increase in}} sales and lodging tax revenue from weddings and wedding-related tourism.|$|E

5|$|The 2011 census {{revealed}} that the borough of Ashford saw the largest population growth in Kent, with records showing a 14.6% rise to 118,000 inhabitants. In 2012, Ashford Borough Council predicted there would be <b>a</b> <b>net</b> <b>gain</b> <b>of</b> 620 jobs per year. The increase in the town's commercial importance, {{as well as its}} strategic location, is witnessed by the number of industry, business and retail parks in the town. These include Waterbrook Park, where there is dedicated space for HGV parking, Eureka Science and Business Park, including manufacturing sites and office complexes; and Orbital Park, the market's current location, which has a regular boot fair.|$|E

5|$|St. Louis Cardinals Pro Bowl rookie Vai Sikahema tied an NFL {{record by}} {{returning}} two punts for touchdowns as the Buccaneers clinched the NFL's worst {{record for the}} second consecutive year. Frank Garcia, playing with a back injury, had a third punt blocked for <b>a</b> <b>net</b> <b>gain</b> <b>of</b> 1 yard. The Buccaneers scored first, on a 1-yard Bobby Howard run, but the Cardinals' 21 unanswered points gave them the lead for good before halftime. A 33-yard touchdown pass from Steve Young to Phil Freeman brought the Buccaneers to within 4 points in the third quarter. The game not only ended a futile season for the Buccaneers, but also concluded the Cardinals' worst season since moving to St. Louis 27 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|The Ohio Department of Development {{estimates}} {{that there are}} 555 motor vehicle production establishments in Ohio, and that by employing around 138,000 people, Ohio motor vehicle production employees account for 12.7% of the United States' motor vehicle production employees.
