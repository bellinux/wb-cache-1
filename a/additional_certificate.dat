30|$|The BestLog [5] project {{warned that}} the {{research}} in the field of certification programmes is far more complex than they initially expected. Hence the detection of <b>additional</b> <b>certificates</b> with a logistics focus is very difficult. Although certificates are created by organisations such as the International Organization for Standardisation (ISO), the certificates themselves are mostly granted by licensed companies or associations, which make the collection of logistics certificates very difficult. These companies often also alter official certificates to customise them to special sectors or fields. Furthermore, many national certificates have been adapted to European certificates, making differentiation complicated. Additionally, many certificates affect logistics indirectly, making clear classification even more complicated. All in all, the project found a high diversity of certifications in the market, with an ambiguous degree of focus.|$|R
40|$|Education in Nondestructive Evaluation {{is managed}} in {{different}} countries and different industrial sectors in various ways. The options vary from special courses for technicians with theoretical and practical knowledge, special courses focused on requirements in dedicated fields as aerospace and learning theoretical and practical issues from Level- 3 -Experts in the company during work. These systems, {{the knowledge of the}} practical aspects of the different methods for technicians who handle day by day with these techniques is splendidly constructed with top-quality. But for engineers, scientists and academics, who work on optimizing and enlarging methods, developing new methods and who use theoretical simulation models, it is important to get a broader scientific background. In this contribution we present a Master Course for Nondestructive Testing developed by the “Dresden International University” in close cooperation with the Technical University Dresden and the Fraunhofer IZFP. The students get an extensive background knowledge of a plurality of Nondestructive methods. The teachers comes from University as well as the Fraunhofer Institute, so it is secured that both the theoretical basics and novel research and developments are included. This is assisted by practical trainig at the Fraunhofer Institute. The requirement for participation is a successful finished study in engineering or science. The special feature on this Master course is its character as correspondence course. The main content is taught at distance learning courses using digital scripts and video conferences, questions are answered using E-mail and phone, too. For four weeks in the year the students have to show presence on campus in Dresden for practical courses and exams. The course of studies finishes with the international accredited certificate as Master of Science for Nondestructive Testing. This master degree can be compared the NDE Minor program that is offered at the Iowa State University. This is an <b>additional</b> <b>certificate</b> that graduate students in engineering can earn by taking a certain number of NDE related courses. In the paper we will briefly compare both Programs for NDE education for graduate students at both Universities...|$|E

40|$|The {{last decade}} has seen {{significant}} innovation {{and change in}} regulatory incentives to support photovoltaic deployment globally. With high fossil fuel dependency and abundant solar resource availability in Australia, grid connected photovoltaics are a viable low carbon technology option in existing electricity grids. Drawing on international examples, the potential to increase grid PV deployment through government response and regulation is explored. For each renewable energy certificate (REC) earned by small scale photovoltaics until 2012, the market provides four <b>additional</b> <b>certificates</b> under the current banded renewable targets. Our analysis indicates that REC eligibility is not accurately estimated currently, and an energy model is developed to calculate the variance. The energy model estimates as much as 26 % additional REC&# 039;s to be obtained by a 3 kWp PV system, {{when compared to the}} currently used regulatory method. Moreover, the provision of REC&# 039;s increases benefits to PV technologies, in the process distorting CO 2 abatement (0. 21 tonne/REC) by 68 %, when PV displaces peaking natural gas plants. Consideration of the secondary effects of a banded structure on emissions trading market is important in the context of designing a range of initiatives intended to support a transition to a low carbon electricity sector...|$|R

30|$|In occupationally {{segmented}} labour markets, young IVET {{graduates who}} cannot find a skilled {{job in the}} occupation for {{which they have been}} trained are not provided with an institutionalised pathway to skilled employment in other occupational sub-segments. Access to occupational segments that do not match the certificate obtained is constrained because occupational mobility would require the acquisition of an <b>additional</b> occupational <b>certificate.</b> Therefore, occupational changes at labour market entrance will direct young IVET graduates into the peripheral segment where no specific certificate is required to take up employment. Following this argument, we can expect occupational changes after IVET to be accompanied by engagement in unskilled employment.|$|R

40|$|The Airplane Flying Handbook is {{designed}} as a technical manual to introduce basic pilot skills and knowledge that are essential for piloting airplanes. It provides information on transition to other airplanes and the operation of various airplane systems. It is developed by the Flight Standards Service, Airman Testing Standards Branch, in cooperation with various aviation educators and industry. This handbook is developed to assist student pilots learning to fly airplanes. It is also beneficial to pilots who wish to improve their flying proficiency and aeronautical knowledge, those pilots preparing for <b>additional</b> <b>certificates</b> or ratings, and flight instructors engaged in the instruction of both student and certificated pilots. It introduces the future pilot {{to the realm of}} flight and provides information and guidance in the performance of procedures and maneuvers required for pilot certification. Topics such as navigation and communication, meteorology, use of flight information publications, regulations, and aeronautical decision making are available in other Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) publications. This handbook conforms to pilot training and certification concepts established by the FAA. There are different ways of teaching, as well as performing flight procedures and maneuvers, and many variations in the explanations of aerodynamic theories and principles. This handbook adopts a selective method and concept of flying airplanes. The discussion and explanations reflect the most commonly used practices and principles. Occasionally the word “must” or similar language is used where the desired action is deemed critical. The use of such language is not intended to add to, interpret, or relieve a duty imposed by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR). It is essential for persons using this handbook to also become familiar with and apply the pertinent parts of 14 CFR and the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM).
