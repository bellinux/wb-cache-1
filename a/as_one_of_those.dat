5|$|Negus {{served in}} the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) with the British Expeditionary Force for the first 18 months of the war. He {{initially}} deployed with the 1st General Hospital, then saw action in the trenches {{on the front line}} with a machine-gun battalion at the First Battle of Ypres. The effects of explosives during this period left him with tinnitus. This was followed by a period serving on hospital barges. In 1916, Negus, still with the RAMC, was posted to the 3rd (Lahore) Division (part of the British Indian Army) and took part in the Mesopotamia Campaign. <b>As</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who had deployed to the Western Front in the opening months of the war, he was later awarded the Mons Star. His service in the RAMC ended in 1919.|$|E

The parliament was to prove entirely fruitless, dismissed on 22 January 1655, with no legislation enacted, and with a final harangue from an exasperated Protector.

25|$|Simon Walker's {{study of}} the Lancastrian {{affinity}} lists Cornwall as plain John, beneath Sir John Cornwall, also a long-serving member of Gaunt's retinue who received the £20 appropriate to a knight. Cornwall of Kinlet is recorded as receiving his 20 marks up to 1399. On 9 June 1397 John Cornewale, knight, was listed <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> granted royal protection for the expedition to Ireland, commanded by Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, the king's Lieutenant. Mortimer was overlord at Kinlet and Ashton, and medieval records are fairly imprecise about knightly status, which makes it quite probable this Cornwall {{was the subject of}} this article. However, there is a strong possibility that it was actually his namesake, who later became Baron Fanhope.|$|E
25|$|Sangiovese's high acidity and {{moderate}} alcohol {{makes it a}} very food-friendly wine {{when it comes to}} food and wine pairings. One of the classic pairings in Italian cuisine is tomato-based pasta and pizza sauces with a Sangiovese-based Chianti. Varietal Sangiovese or those with a smaller proportion of the powerful, full-bodied Cabernet blended in, can accentuate the flavours of relatively bland dishes like meatloaf and roast chicken. Herb seasoning such as basil, thyme and sage play off the herbal notes of the grapes. Sangiovese that has been subject to more aggressive oak treatment pairs well with grilled and smoked food. If Cabernet, Merlot or Syrah plays a dominant role, the food pairing option should treat the Sangiovese blend <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> fuller-bodied reds and pair with heavier dishes such as steak and thick soups like ribollita and puréed bean soup.|$|E

25|$|A {{particular}} controversy involves {{allegations against}} the young Baconsky {{for the way}} in which he treated his colleagues. Many voices in the literary community have come to suspect that he was an informant for the Securitate secret police, and that his reports helped in the arrest of other writers. Crina Bud proposes that, if such accounts are true, Baconsky may have used the Securitate in order to silence those who competed with him for the approval of his teacher, philosopher Lucian Blaga. The accusations are traced by Cernat to two separate sources: Baconsky's adversaries in the Sibiu Literary Circle and Securitate general Nicolae Pleşiţă. During his early activities in Cluj, Baconsky is also alleged to have partaken in the marginalization of a less enthusiastic writer, Ion Dezideriu Sîrbu, who was later to become a political prisoner (in Sîrbu's memoirs, Baconsky is singled out <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who betrayed his confidence).|$|E
25|$|Some of N. D. Cocea's {{writings}} {{enjoyed a}} good standing throughout Romania's communist period. During the early 1960s, official textbooks described him <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> {{who covered the}} gap between 19th-century Realism and Romanian Socialist Realism. In particular, the communist regime overplayed Cocea's criticism of the Romanian monarchy, glorifying him as someone who had undermined the credibility of Michael I and his predecessors. In one instance, communist historiography even claimed that Cocea and Arghezi had served time for their 1912 anti-monarchy campaign, taking Facla lampoons at face value. Cocea's World War II diaries were passed on to his relatives in Switzerland, and have not been published except for the short fragments hosted in the 1960s by two Romanian reviews: Magazin Istoric and Secolul XX. In 1970, an edition of his Jurnal ("Diary") was issued by the PCR's Editura Politică. A previously unknown novel by Cocea was signaled in the late 1970s, and noted for its virulent attacks on Pamfil Șeicaru.|$|E
25|$|Peucestas (in Greek Πευκέστας; lived 4th century BC) was {{a native}} of the town of Mieza, in Macedonia, and a {{distinguished}} officer in the service of Alexander the Great. His name is first mentioned <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> appointed to command a trireme on the Hydaspes. Previous to this we do not find him holding any command of importance; but it is evident that he must have distinguished himself for his personal valour and prowess, as he was the person selected by Alexander to carry before him in battle the sacred shield, which he had taken down from the temple of Athena at Troy. In this capacity he was in close attendance upon the king's person in the assault on the capital city of the Malavas (325 BC); and all authors agreed in attributing the chief share in saving the life of Alexander upon that occasion to Peucestas, while they differed as to almost all the other circumstances and persons concerned.|$|E

He failed, and joined Prime's team of Autobots on Earth (picking up a slight English accent in the process), where he battled Megatron's Decepticons on numerous occasions. Prime sent him to the Speed Planet Velocitron to locate the planet's Cyber Planet Key. Much to Red Alert's displeasure, Hot Shot got increasingly involved in the planet's affairs, rescuing Brakedown from Ransack and Crumplezone. Red Alert eventually called in Prime when {{the two of them were}} nearly destroyed in a sneak attack by Ransack, Crumplezone and Dirt Boss. However, despite Prime's initial displeasure, Hot Shot went on to win the Key in a race.|$|E
25|$|Though {{dictatorship}} {{was initially}} welcomed by the Carlists as {{a stepping stone}} towards a Traditionalist monarchy, in 1925 the claimant Don Jaime switched to opposition. Bau decided not to follow suit and went on contributing to the regime; in literature he is usually listed along Victor Pradera and Esteban Bilbao <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> Carlists who abandoned their king and joined the primoderiverista version of the Alfonsine monarchy. In 1927 he {{was appointed to the}} quasi-parliament, , standing as representative of Organizaciones provinciales de Unión Patriótica and representative of the Ayuntamientos; in the chamber {{he became one of the}} youngest members. He kept supporting the dictator by staging welcome celebrations in Tortosa and organizing manifestations of tortosinos in Madrid in 1928. In 1929 Bau was re-elected jefe of the local Union Patriotica, engaged in , animated the youth branch named Juventud Patriotica and until 1930s financed a local Tortosa periodical, Union Patriotica.
