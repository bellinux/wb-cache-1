5|$|Within C.pepo, the pumpkins, the scallops, and {{possibly}} the crooknecks are ancient and were domesticated at different times and places. The domesticated forms of C.pepo have larger fruits than non-domesticated forms and seeds that <b>are</b> <b>bigger</b> but fewer in number. In a 1989 study on the origins and development of C.pepo, botanist Harry Paris suggested that the original wild specimen had a small round fruit and that the modern pumpkin is its direct descendant. He suggested that the crookneck, ornamental gourd, and scallop are early variants and that the acorn is a cross between the scallop and the pumpkin.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, {{we study}} the partial and generic {{uniqueness}} of block term tensor decompositions in signal processing. We present several conditions for generic uniqueness of tensor decompositions of multilinear rank (1, L 1, L 1), [...] ., (1, LR, LR) terms. Our proof {{is based on}} algebraic geometric methods. Mathematical preliminaries for this dissertation are multilinear algebra, and classical algebraic geometry. In geometric language, we prove that the joins of relevant subspace varieties are not tangentially weakly defective. We also give conditions for partial uniqueness of block term tensor decompositions by proving that the joins of relevant subspace varieties are not defective. The main result is the following. For a tensor Y belong to the tensor product of three complex vector spaces of dimensions I, J, K, we assume that L 1, L 2, [...] ., LR is from small to large, K <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to J, and J <b>is</b> strictly <b>bigger</b> than LR. If the dimension of ambient space is strictly less than IJK, then for general tensors among those admitting block term tensor decomposition, the block term tensor decomposition is partially unique {{under the condition that}} the binomial coefficient indexed by J and LR <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to R, and I <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to 2; it has infinitely many expressions under the condition IJK is strictly less than the sum from L_ 1 ^ 2 to L_R^ 2; it is essentially unique under any of the following there conditions: (i) I <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to 2, J, K <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to the sum from L 1 to LR (ii) R is 2, I <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to 2 (iii) I <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to R, K <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to the sum from L 1 to LR, J <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to 2 LR, the binomial coefficient indexed by J and LR <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to R...|$|R
25|$|The {{males have}} {{feathery}} antennae versus the thin antennae of females. Size differences are also noted, with the forewing {{of the male}} moth being 20–24mm long, {{and that of the}} female 31–35mm. Obviously, from this it is noticeable that the females <b>are</b> <b>bigger</b> than the males. Another important difference between the sexes is that females possess fully formed wings, but do not fly. Female flight is common in Eurasia and Asia, but these moths may be of a different species. The other species is called the Asian gypsy moth.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the types}} of prey Vespula vulgaris and Vespula germanica forage are almost the same, that of Vespula germanica are {{generally}} 2–3.5 times bigger and heavier than that of Vespula vulgaris. This is mainly due to the size difference of the two species. Because the Vespula germanica foragers <b>are</b> <b>bigger</b> in morphology than those of Vespula vulgaris, and they both transport the prey by carrying on them, it would be advantageous for the wasp to be bigger {{to be able to}} hold larger prey.|$|E

25|$|Cuttlefish are {{indeterminate}} growers, so smaller cuttlefish {{always have}} a chance at finding a mate the next year, when they <b>are</b> <b>bigger.</b> Additionally, cuttlefish unable to win in a direct confrontation with a guard male have been observed employing several other tactics to acquire a mate. The most successful of these methods is camouflage; smaller cuttlefish will use their camouflage abilities to disguise themselves as a female cuttlefish. Changing their body color, concealing their extra arms (males have four pairs, females only have three), and even pretending to be holding an egg sack, disguised males are able to swim past the larger guard male and mate with the female.|$|E
25|$|The SD70ACe-T4 is the Tier 4 {{emissions}} standards-compliant {{version of}} the SD70ACe. The first locomotive was built in summer 2015, and made its debut at the Railway Interchange Expo in Minneapolis, Minnesota during the weekend of October 3–4, 2015. It features a new 4-stroke engine called the EMD 12-1010 - a V12 with 1010 cu.in displacement for each cylinder. This new prime mover has a two-stage turbocharger system consisting of three turbos; one turbo (the primary/high pressure turbo) for low-mid RPM and two turbos (the secondary/low pressure turbos) for mid-high RPM. The results of this setup <b>are</b> <b>bigger</b> power throughout the broader RPM range, better fuel efficiency, and lower emission. An EGR system is applied as well, allowing the engine to achieve Tier 4 {{without the use of}} urea after treatment. Another new feature of this engine is the Double-Walled Fuel Injection System that increases safety and provides simplified maintenance works.|$|E
25|$|The Binou sect uses totems: common {{ones for}} the entire village and {{individual}} ones for totem priests. A totem animal is worshiped on a Binou altar. Totems are, for example, the buffalo for Ogol-du-Haut and the panther for Ogol-du-Bas. Normally, no one is harmed by their totem animal, even {{if this is a}} crocodile, as it is for the village of Amani (where there is a large pool of crocodiles that do not harm villagers). However, a totem animal might exceptionally harm if one has done something wrong. A worshiper is not allowed to eat his totem. For example, an individual with a buffalo as totem is not allowed to eat buffalo meat, allowed to use leather from its skin, nor even to see a buffalo die. If this happens by accident, he has to organise a purification sacrifice at the Binou altar. Boiled millet is offered, and goats and chickens are sacrificed on a Binou altar. This colours the altar white and red. Binou altars look like little houses with a door. They <b>are</b> <b>bigger</b> when the altar is for an entire village. A village altar has also the 'cloud hook', that will catch clouds and make it rain.|$|E

25|$|Bradypodion pumilum have a {{much higher}} {{survival}} rate in a metropolitan area if they <b>are</b> <b>bigger</b> in size. Their survival rate was dependent on body size, and the larger the size, the greater the chance that the individual would survive a ten-day period. Larger, older chameleons {{tend to be more}} sedentary compared to the smaller younger ones which means that the larger ones likely have smaller home ranges. Smaller chameleons inhabit grasses while larger chameleons are found mainly in bushes and trees. This is territorial, because it is believed that larger males would cannibalize smaller ones intruding on their territory. An alternative thought is that the smaller chameleons simply do not have big enough limbs to grasp larger branches correctly. When fighting contests occur, the outcome is influenced by the height of the ornamental casque, the relative size of the pink patch {{in the center of the}} flank, and previous experience. The ornamental casque is the protruding head piece of the chameleon, usually with a rounded end. The height of this piece is an honest signal to other male chameleons representing its total size. Similarly with the pink patch in the center of the flank, this is an honest signal showing that the chameleon has a healthy diet correlating to the strength of the individual. The turnover rate in males is thought to be higher than females.|$|E
25|$|Meat, {{as already}} described, is an {{important}} part of a grizzly's diet. Grizzly bears occasionally prey on small mammals, such as marmots, ground squirrels, lemmings, and voles. The most famous example of such predation is in Denali National Park and Preserve, where grizzlies chase, pounce on, and dig up Arctic ground squirrels to eat. In some areas, grizzly bears prey on hoary marmots, overturning rocks to reach them, and in some cases preying on them when they are in hibernation. Larger prey includes bison and moose, which are sometimes taken by bears in Yellowstone National Park. Because bison and moose are dangerous prey, grizzlies usually use cover to stalk them and/or pick off weak individuals or calves. Grizzlies in Alaska also regularly prey on moose calves, which in Denali National Park may be their main source of meat. In fact, grizzly bears are such important predators of moose and elk calves in Alaska and in Yellowstone, that they may kill as many as 51 percent of elk or moose calves born that year. Grizzly bears have also been blamed in the decline of elk in Yellowstone National Park when the actual predators were thought to be gray wolves. In northern Alaska, grizzlies are a significant predator of caribou, mostly taking sick or old individuals or calves. Several studies show that grizzly bears may follow the caribou herds year-round in order to maintain their food supply. In northern Alaska, grizzly bears often encounter muskox. Despite the fact that muskox do not usually occur in grizzly habitat and that they <b>are</b> <b>bigger</b> and more powerful than caribou, predation on muskox by grizzlies has been recorded.|$|E
