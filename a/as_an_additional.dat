5|$|A {{sequel to}} Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving, was {{announced}} {{as a reward}} for contributing to the Idle Thumbs podcast revival Kickstarter. The game was released to Kickstarter backers in July 2012, and later offered as a purchasable title on Steam, which included Gravity Bone <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>additional</b> feature. The game, though not a direct sequel in story to Gravity Bone, follows the main character in a heist with two other characters that goes very wrong. The title was critically acclaimed by reviewers, who called the very short but non-linear storytelling of Thirty Flights a novel use of the video game medium.|$|E
5|$|Although {{called an}} offstream storage {{reservoir}} by USBR, the reservoir floods {{part of the}} San Luis Creek valley. San Luis Creek, however, is not the primary water source for the reservoir. Downstream of San Luis Reservoir is O'Neill Forebay, which is intersected by the Delta-Mendota Canal, a separate CVP facility. Water is pumped from the canal into the Forebay and uphill into San Luis Reservoir, which functions <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>additional</b> water source during dry periods.|$|E

5|$|Arghezi's texts for Seara {{were largely}} unknown to later generations. They again saw print in 2003, in a {{critical}} edition co-edited by daughter Mitzura Arghezi (Domnica Theodorescu) and Traian Radu. According to philogist Gheorghe Pienescu, who collected and reedited the texts for printing in the 1960s, the copies were taken from him under false pretense by Mitzura Arghezi, and never returned. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>additional</b> contribution to Romanian literature, Searas popularization of the expression craii de Curtea-Veche may have inspired Mateiu Caragiale in writing his celebrated 1929 novel.|$|E

The latter plays host to the annual Ribble Valley International Piano Week. Several former pupils have gone on to achieve success upon the stage, including OSCAR-winning actor and director Charles Laughton and BAFTA-winning director and producer Peter Glenville.|$|E

SR 125 serves <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>additional</b> north–south route in the San Diego {{metropolitan}} area, also connecting SR 54, SR 94, and Interstate 8 (I-8).

Saint-Marc-des-Carrières limestone is a pearly grey, and becomes a pale beige with age, while Queenston limestone has pink calcite streaks from crinoid fossils and takes a chamois tint as it ages.|$|E

5|$|The next year, Luo {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{a more thorough}} analysis confirming their previous conclusion and adding the Cretaceous Australian Bishops to Australosphenida.

In the same year, Asfaltomylos was described from the Jurassic of Argentina as another australosphenidan. In contrast to Ambondro, this animal lacked a distal metacristid and did not have as well-developed a lingual cingulum.|$|E

5|$|Besides K. langenbergensis, other {{crocodilians}} {{from the}} Langenberg Quarry include the marine Machimosaurus hugii and Steneosaurus aff. brevirostris, {{which would have}} lived offshore and fed on turtles and fish; and the amphibious generalist Goniopholis simus, which subsisted on a diet of both shelly and soft prey like modern alligators. The quarry is best-known as the type locality of the brachiosaurid sauropod dinosaur Europasaurus holgeri, which was an insular dwarf. Isolated teeth show that {{there were at least}} four different types of theropods present at the locality, including the megalosaurid Torvosaurus sp. as well <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>additional</b> megalosaurid and indeterminate members of the Allosauridae and Ceratosauria; theropod tracks from two different species (not identifiable to the family level) are also known.

5|$|Carre's is a state-run {{selective}} grammar school. It {{converted to}} an Academy and reopened on 1 August 2011; it {{is governed by}} Carre's Grammar School Academy Trust and converted without sponsorship. As of 2015, the student body {{is made up of}} 815 pupils aged 11–18. The school admits boys on a selective basis for years 7–11 and has a co-educational Sixth Form; there are 60 girls on roll as of 2015. The majority of pupils come from White British backgrounds and very few pupils speak English <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>additional</b> language. The number of pupils supported through allowances, including those eligible for free school meals (2.3%), is below average, as is the number of students with learning disabilities. Pupils are allocated into houses based on their forms. The first house system at Carre's consisted of four sets: scarlet, maroon, green and blue. They became houses in 1933 as Carre, Bristol, Lafford and Welby, named respectively after its founder, the Earls of Bristol, an old name for Sleaford, and Richard Welby, who owned the Gedney lands purchased by Carre.|$|E

5|$|In Saint Lucia, downpours {{triggered}} torrential flooding {{along the}} island's easternmost coast from October5 through October6. In Dennery Quarter, flash floods affected about 500 households; among them, 400 had their houses flooded or severely damaged. Several residences {{had to be}} evacuated, and some people were trapped in their homes. Residents also suffered from the absence of drinking water, lack of electricity, and the inability to prepare meals due {{to the loss of}} kitchen equipment and other utensils. In response, the area was declared a disaster zone; a total of EC$500,000 ($185,185USD) was approved to assist flood victims, as well <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>additional</b> US$44,194 allocated from the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the Merrie England bar and an {{amusement}} arcade were constructed {{at the end}} of the pier nearest to the shore. The 1939 theatre, which is still in use, narrowly escaped damage in 1985 when the early stages of a fire were noticed by performer Vince Hill. In the 1980s, a Victorian-styled entrance was built. In 1991 the pier gained the Carousel bar <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>additional</b> attraction, and a small tramway to ease access to the pier-head. By this point, the pier had ceased to have any nautical use, but the jetty section was adapted for use as a helicopter pad in the late 1980s. The Christmas Eve storm of 1997 destroyed the landing jetty, including the helipad.|$|E
5|$|In the 1979–80 European Cup, Linfield {{were drawn}} to face Dundalk from the Republic of Ireland. In the first leg, which was played in Dundalk and ended in a 1–1 draw, crowd {{disturbance}} prompted UEFA to switch the second leg to the Haarlem Stadion, Netherlands. Linfield were held almost entirely accountable for the events, and were forced to pay Dundalk's costs {{to travel to the}} Netherlands as well <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>additional</b> £5,000 for damage sustained to Oriel Park. Dundalk were fined £870 for providing insufficient security at the match. Dundalk eventually won the match 2–0 to progress 3–1 on aggregate. In the 1987–88 campaign, Linfield's home game against Lillestrøm was marred by missile throwing, resulting in UEFA sanctions which meant that the club had to play their next two home games in European competitions at Welsh club Wrexham in 1988–89 and 1989–90.|$|E
