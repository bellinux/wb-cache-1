25|$|Upon {{his release}} from prison in December 1984, Chikatilo found new work at a {{locomotive}} factory in Novocherkassk and kept a low profile. He did not kill again until 1 August 1985 when, {{on a business trip}} to Moscow, he encountered an 18-year-old woman, named Natalia Pokhlistova, at a railway platform near Domodedovo Airport. Pokhlistova was lured into <b>a</b> <b>thicket</b> <b>of</b> woods where she was bound, stabbed 38 times, then strangled to death. Based upon the hypothesis that the killer had travelled from the Rostov Oblast to Moscow via air, investigators checked all Aeroflot flight records of passengers who had commuted between Moscow and the Rostov Oblast between late July and early August. On this occasion, however, Chikatilo had travelled to Moscow by train and, accordingly, no documentation existed for investigators to research. Four weeks later, on 27 August, Chikatilo killed another young woman, Irina Gulyaeva, in Shakhty. As had been the case with Natalia Pokhlistova, the wounds inflicted upon the victim linked her murder to the hunt for the serial killer.|$|E
25|$|As {{the larger}} temple {{dedicated}} to the king, the hypostyle hall or pronaos is supported by six pillars; in this case, however, they are not Osiris pillars depicting the king, but are decorated with scenes with the queen playing the sistrum (an instrument sacred to the goddess Hathor), together with the gods Horus, Khnum, Khonsu, and Thoth, and the goddesses Hathor, Isis, Maat, Mut of Asher, Satis and Taweret; in one scene Ramesses is presenting flowers or burning incense. The capitals of the pillars bear {{the face of the}} goddess Hathor; this type of column is known as Hathoric. The bas-reliefs in the pillared hall illustrate the deification of the king, the destruction of his enemies in the north and south (in this scenes the king is accompanied by his wife), and the queen making offerings to the goddess Hathor and Mut. The hypostyle hall is followed by a vestibule, access to which is given by three large doors. On the south and the north walls of this chamber there are two graceful and poetic bas-reliefs of the king and his consort presenting papyrus plants to Hathor, who is depicted as a cow on a boat sailing in <b>a</b> <b>thicket</b> <b>of</b> papyri. On the west wall, RamessesII and Nefertari are depicted making offerings to god Horus and the divinities of the Cataracts — Satis, Anubis and Khnum.|$|E

500|$|William Chamberlayne {{inherited}} the castle in 1826 {{and built a}} crenellated tower on the south-east end of the property the following year, inspired by a proposal by the antiquarian Horace Walpole that the castle be made habitable. A description of the castle around this time suggested it stood [...] "in the midst of <b>a</b> <b>thicket</b> <b>of</b> trees, on a little hill close to the beach" [...] and formed [...] "a striking object seen from the water". It became popular with artists, and J. M. W. Turner visited and sketched the castle and its new tower, probably in 1832.|$|E
500|$|In Egyptian accounts, the {{pregnant}} Isis hides from Set, {{to whom the}} unborn child is a threat, in <b>a</b> <b>thicket</b> <b>of</b> papyrus in the Nile Delta. This place is called Akh-bity, meaning [...] "papyrus thicket of the king of Lower Egypt" [...] in Egyptian. Greek writers call this place Khemmis and indicate that it is {{near the city of}} Buto, but in the myth, the physical location is less important than its nature as an iconic place of seclusion and safety. The thicket's special status is indicated by its frequent depiction in Egyptian art; for most events in Egyptian mythology, the backdrop is minimally described or illustrated. In this thicket, Isis gives birth to Horus and raises him, and hence it is also called the [...] "nest of Horus". The image of Isis nursing her child is a very common motif in Egyptian art.|$|E

Deidre Donahue, writing in USA Today, also stated that the book had [...] "sometimes excessive detail" [...] but praised its [...] "marvelous perspective". Ernest W. Lefever wrote in The Washington Times that [...] "Applegate's fact-studded and fast-paced portrait of one of America's most famous preachers from one of America's most famous 19th-century families is a remarkably authentic mirror of the times", criticizing only the [...] "minor flaw" [...] {{of a lack of}} nuance in her description of Calvinism. Heather Cox Richardson praised the book in The Chicago Tribune, calling it [...] "one of those rare books that delivers a great deal more than it promises"; though critical of what she saw as some factual errors and [...] "unsubstantiated claims" [...] by Applegate, such as Lyman Beecher's role in creating mass media, Richardson concluded that these flaws [...] "do not cripple her story".|$|E
500|$|The ancient epic of the Indian subcontinent, the Mahabharata of Vyasa, {{contains}} two pivotal moments of conscience. The first {{occurs when the}} warrior Arjuna being overcome with compassion against killing his opposing relatives in war, receives counsel (see Bhagavad-Gita) from Krishna about his spiritual duty ("work as though you are performing a sacrifice for the general good"). The second, {{at the end of}} the saga, is when king Yudhishthira having alone survived the moral tests of life, is offered eternal bliss, only to refuse it because a faithful dog is prevented from coming with him by purported divine rules and laws. The French author Montaigne (1533–1592) in one of the most celebrated of his essays ("On experience") expressed the benefits of living with a clear conscience: [...] "Our duty is to compose our character, not to compose books, to win not battles and provinces, but order and tranquillity in our conduct. Our great and glorious masterpiece is to live properly". In his famous Japanese travel journal Oku no Hosomichi (Narrow Road to the Deep North) composed of mixed haiku poetry and prose, Matsuo Basho (1644–94) in attempting to describe the eternal in this perishable world is often moved in conscience; for example by <b>a</b> <b>thicket</b> <b>of</b> summer grass being all that remains of the dreams and ambitions of ancient warriors. Chaucer's [...] "Franklin's Tale" [...] in The Canterbury Tales recounts how a young suitor releases a wife from a rash promise because of the respect in his conscience for the freedom to be truthful, gentle and generous.|$|E

[...] It seemed he had scarcely a chance to escape, for the enemy was near. [...] He yelled frantically at the ponies to start them toward home, while he dropped off into <b>a</b> <b>thicket</b> <b>of</b> willows and hid there. [...] A part of the herd was caught in sight of the camp and there was a counter chase, but the Crows got away with the ponies. [...] Of course, his mother was frantic, believing her boy had been killed or captured. But after the excitement was over, he appeared in camp unhurt. [...] When questioned about his escape, he remarked: [...] "I knew they would not take the time to hunt for small game when there was so much bigger close by." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Kazimiroff Nature Trail, a {{wildlife}} observation trail, opened in 1986. It traverses [...] of Hunter Island. Much of the island’s natural features are found along the trail. [...] It was opened in 1986 and comprises two overlapping lasso-shaped paths, one slightly {{longer than the}} other. Along the shared [...] "lasso spur" [...] is a canal for mosquito control {{as well as an}} intersection with the old Hunter Island causeway's cobblestone approach path. Going counterclockwise from the intersection with the two [...] "loops", the trail passes through a grove of 100 Norway Spruces planted in 1918; a black locust forest from the 1970s; and <b>a</b> <b>thicket</b> <b>of</b> shrubs and vines. At this point, the longer [...] "blue" [...] trail diverges to the northwest and then northeast, passing the former Hunter Mansion's knoll; a forest of white pines; some mugwort and Ailanthus weeds; the Hunter Mansion's main driveway; a less dense patch of trees and burnt tree stumps, part of a forest burned by the Siwanoy; white oaks and black locusts; and lichen in the boulders, a rare occurrence in New York City parks. The shorter [...] "red" [...] trail goes directly north through a white poplar forest; a grove scorched by an uncontrolled fire; and remnants of the former estates' stone walls. Both trails merge and loop back to the east and south, passing through glacial-erratic boulders, New England bedrock, and the island's salt marsh.|$|E
2500|$|Henry Warren was {{contracted}} to haul supplies to forts {{in the west}} of Texas, including Fort Richardson, Fort Griffin, and Fort Concho. On May 18, 1871, travelling down the Jacksboro-Belknap road heading towards Salt Creek Crossing, the supplies wagon train encountered Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, but, {{less than an hour}} later, the teamsters spotted a rather large group of riders ahead. Hidden in <b>a</b> <b>thicket</b> <b>of</b> scrub in the Salt Creek Prairie, the Kiowa had observed, without attacking, the slow approach of General Sherman's inspection retinue. [...] The previous night, Mamanti ("He Walking-above"), the powerful shaman rival of Tene-angopte's friend Napawat ("No Mocassins"), had prophesied that this small party would be followed by a larger one with more plunder for the taking. [...] Three hours later the 10 mule-drawn wagons filled with army corn and fodder came to the spot: in front of the charging warriors, the corn train [...] quickly shifted into a ring formation, and all the mules were put {{into the center of the}} ring, but the defenders were overwhelmed and the warriors destroyed the corn supplies, killing and mutilating seven of the wagoneer's bodies. [...] The Kiowa warriors lost three of their own, but left with 40 mules heavily laden with supplies. Five white men managed to escape, one of which was Thomas Brazeale who reached Fort Richardson on foot, some 20 miles away. As soon as Col. Ranald S. Mackenzie learned of the incident, he informed Sherman. Sherman and Mackenzie searched for the warriors responsible for the raid. The ambush had been planned by a large band of Kiowa warriors under the leadership of Satanta, Ado-ete ("Big Tree"), Satank, and Mamanti ("He Walking-above"), and several other chiefs took part in it, as did Zepko-ete ("Big Bow"), Tsen-tainte ("White Horse"), Guatotente ("Eagle Heart"), Gui-guako ("Yellow Wolf"), Set-maunte ("Fast Bear"), and, perhaps, Guipago himself.|$|E
