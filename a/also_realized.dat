5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1967, Cristaldi joined her in the United States. While the two were staying in Atlanta, he surprised her by taking her to their wedding ceremony which he had arranged without her knowledge. She went ahead with the ceremony, but was concerned about sacrificing the rights she had to her child Patrick. She <b>also</b> <b>realized</b> she was increasingly unable {{to make decisions about}} her own life. The marriage was never made official in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Germany <b>also</b> <b>realized</b> the {{national}} importance of design during World War II. Between 1933 and 1945 Adolf Hitler used design, architecture and propaganda {{to increase his}} power; shown through the annual Reichsparteitage in Nürnberg on September 5. Heinrich Himmler coordinated several design activities for Hitler, including: the all-black SS-uniform designed by Professor Karl Diebitsch and Walter Heck in 1933; the Dachau concentration camp, designed by Theodor Eicke, and prototypes for other Nazi concentration camps; and the Wewelsburg redesign commissioned by Heinrich Himmler in 1944.|$|E
5|$|It was <b>also</b> <b>realized</b> {{that the}} beta decay of 239Np must produce an isotope of element 94 (now called plutonium), but the {{quantities}} involved in McMillan and Abelson's original experiment were too small to isolate and identify plutonium along with neptunium. The discovery of plutonium {{had to wait until}} the end of 1940, when Glenn T. Seaborg and his team identified the isotope plutonium-238.|$|E

5|$|On 9 July {{a meeting}} between Kluge, Model, Joachim Lemelsen and Josef Harpe {{was held at the}} {{headquarters}} of the XLVII Panzer Corps. It had become clear to the German commanders that the 9th Army lacked the strength to obtain a breakthrough, and their Soviet counterparts had <b>also</b> <b>realized</b> this, but Kluge wished to maintain the pressure on the Soviets in order to aid the southern offensive.|$|E
5|$|Tucker {{continued}} {{his work in}} literature along with that in the law, and in 1814–1815 the Philadelphia Port Folio published a series of his essays entitled Thoughts of a Hermit. Financial success was for once his {{as a result of}} these endeavors; he <b>also</b> <b>realized</b> profits from land sales near the Dan River, and the sale of Woodbridge when the family moved again, to Lynchburg, Virginia in 1818.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Hobbits’ fears, Faramir {{was wise}} {{enough to realize that}} such a weapon was not to be used and if desired, should be resisted. With this knowledge, he <b>also</b> <b>realized</b> what his brother had to face, and wished that he had gone on the quest himself — knowing that Boromir {{would not have been able}} to resist the temptation to seize the Ring for himself. Giving the Hobbits provisions, he sent them on their way to {{continue}} their quest, but warned Frodo that their guide, Gollum, was a treacherous creature, and that an unknown terror lived in Cirith Ungol, where Gollum was leading them.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{gameplay}} {{elements were}} directly taken from Far Cry 3. Exotic locations, hunting, {{and the freedom}} for players to complete missions through different approaches were maintained in Far Cry 4. The team hoped that by incorporating and expanding upon on these ideas, while introducing new features, they could make Far Cry 4 an evolution for the series. As a result, {{the size of the}} game's outposts became larger and players were given more options to customize their weapons. The team <b>also</b> <b>realized</b> that players {{spent a lot of time}} interacting with the open world of Far Cry 3, and decided to put more effort and resources into the world's design and add more quests to the game.|$|E
5|$|Campaigning on a {{platform}} of progressive reforms, McCreary defeated Republican Edward C. O'Rear in the general election. During this second term, he became the first inhabitant of the state's second (and current) governor's mansion; he is also the only governor to have inhabited both the old and new mansions. During his second term, he succeeded in convincing the legislature to make women eligible to vote in school board elections, to mandate direct primary elections, to create a state public utilities commission, and to allow the state's counties to hold local option elections {{to decide whether or not}} to adopt prohibition. He <b>also</b> <b>realized</b> substantial increases in education spending and won passage of reforms such as a mandatory school attendance law, but was unable to secure passage of laws restricting lobbying in the legislative chambers and providing for a workers' compensation program. McCreary was one of five commissioners charged with overseeing construction of the new governor's mansion and exerted considerable influence on the construction plans. His term expired in 1915, and he died three years later. McCreary County was formed during McCreary's second term in office and was named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Fraser {{returned}} to Toronto {{and took up}} her research post, simultaneously working as a demonstrator with the Department of Hygiene and Preventative Medicine. She {{was one of the}} founding faculty of the School of Hygiene at U of T. She made her home with her brother Donald; Williams, who had also returned from England, moved in with her own mother. Though the two women wanted to live together, raise children and continue their careers, they were unwilling to displease or fail in their obligations to their mothers. They <b>also</b> <b>realized</b> that though they were middle-class, working women, economic inequalities in their pay compromised their ability to support themselves and their need to remain in the good graces of their families for support. When Williams was bequeathed a farm near Aurora, Ontario, the couple believed it might become their haven, but when Williams applied for courses at the Ontario School of Agriculture, she was advised the courses were full. For the next several years, they lived apart but within a 30-minute walk from each other at various residences.|$|E

5|$|The Armeeoberkommando (AOK) {{acknowledged}} that an undefeated Serbia severed Austria-Hungary's {{connection to the}} Ottoman Empire and prevented {{the completion of the}} Berlin–Baghdad railway. The AOK <b>also</b> <b>realized</b> that the Austro-Hungarian Army's inability to defeat Serbia would discourage neutral countries—such as Bulgaria, Romania and Greece—from joining the Central Powers and would tempt Italy to open up a third front against Austria-Hungary. Nevertheless, the AOK was hesitant to authorize a third invasion of Serbia. This changed in September 1914, when Austro-Hungarian troops discovered a map in an abandoned Semlin bookshop, titled The New Division of Europe. Originally printed in a Russian newspaper, the map was widely sold in Serbia and depicted the borders of Europe as they would appear following the war. Germany was to be divided into northern and southern confederations and Austria-Hungary was to be abolished, its eastern provinces given to Russia, Romania, the Czechs and the Hungarians, and its southern provinces divided between Serbia and Italy. Alarmed by the prospect of Austria-Hungary's disintegration, Emperor Franz Joseph personally authorized a third invasion of Serbia in early October 1914.|$|E
25|$|Euler <b>also</b> <b>realized</b> {{that the}} {{composition}} of two rotations is equivalent to a single rotation about a different fixed axis (Euler's rotation theorem). Therefore, {{the composition of}} the former three angles has to be equal to only one rotation, whose axis was complicated to calculate until matrices were developed.|$|E
25|$|Tritium {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1934 from deuterium, another isotope of hydrogen, by Ernest Rutherford, Mark Oliphant, and Paul Harteck. However, their experiment could not isolate tritium, which was later accomplished by Luis Alvarez and Robert Cornog, who <b>also</b> <b>realized</b> tritium's radioactivity. Willard F. Libby recognized that tritium {{could be used}} for radiometric dating of water and wine.|$|E

25|$|The {{next decade}} saw studies based on more {{rigorous}} mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision. These include {{the concept of}} scale-space, the inference of shape from various cues such as shading, texture and focus, and contour models known as snakes. Researchers <b>also</b> <b>realized</b> {{that many of these}} mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields.|$|E
25|$|The {{collapse}} of the AA in the steel industry was due {{not only to the}} shock of the loss at Homestead, but by changing conditions in the steel industry. So long as steel, like iron smelting, remained a craft-like endeavor, the AA—with the allegiance of each plant's skilled workers—could control the industry. But as the steel industry mechanized, the skills needed to manufacture steel shrank. Inexperienced workers could learn the unskilled work quickly. Steel manufacturers <b>also</b> <b>realized</b> that having multi-plant operations meant that production could continue if the union struck a particular facility.|$|E
25|$|At Fort Necessity, the {{provision}} hut was depleted, {{and there was}} little shelter from the heavy rain that started to fall on the 2nd. With the rain, the trenches that Washington had ordered to be dug had turned into streams. Washington realized {{that he would have}} to defend against a frontal assault and <b>also</b> <b>realized</b> that it would be difficult because the woods were less than 100 yards away, within musket range, making it possible for a besieging attacker to pick off the defenders. To improve the defense, Washington ordered his men to cut trees down and to make them into makeshift breastworks.|$|E

25|$|Suddenly, {{it was her}} {{regime that}} was in trouble. She could not {{comprehend}} how Nwe's small band of men could have defeated the Pegu army. But she <b>also</b> <b>realized</b> from the open bickering between Zeik-Bye and Maru {{that she was in}} no position to organize another attack. She ordered an immediate upgrade of Pegu's moats and fortified walls. Zeik-Bye meanwhile kept Nwe apprised of the developments. By then, her authority was too weak. When Nwe and his small army appeared outside Pegu's walls on 10 December 1383, she could do nothing other than hunker down inside the city walls.|$|E

Xwechtáal received wives from all the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh until he finally returned home to Stá7mes. Just as before, the village came forward and watched as he used his magical powers. This time was different. Xwechtáal had noticed that his first wife, from before he left on his journey, had remarried. He <b>also</b> <b>realized</b> he was not gone four days like he expected, but 10 years had passed. Instead of reviving the entire village, he left his ex-wife and her husband dead.|$|E
