They can share an access network with standard communication technology, such as IEEE 802. 11 ah. However, an authentication and key management (AKM) mechanism for resource constrained IoT devices using IEEE 802. 11 ah {{has not been}} proposed as yet. We therefore propose a new AKM mechanism for an IoT access network, {{which is based on}} IEEE 802. 11 key management with the IEEE 802. 1 X authentication mechanism. The proposed AKM mechanism does not require any pre-configured security information between the <b>access</b> <b>network</b> <b>domain</b> and the IoT service domain. It considers the resource constraints of IoT devices, allowing IoT devices to delegate the burden of AKM processes to a powerful agent. The agent has sufficient power to support various authentication methods for the access point, and it performs cryptographic functions for the IoT devices. Performance analysis shows that the proposed mechanism greatly reduces computation costs, network costs, and memory usage of the resource-constrained IoT device as compared to the existing IEEE 802. 11 Key Management with the IEEE 802. 1 X authentication mechanism...|$|E

Integrated services technologies based on IPv 6 have been developed and implemented in a pan-European field trial where students are eval-uating distance learning applications with QoS control. An overview of the architecture is given, followed by a description of the features of the basic technologies. The background for selecting the technologies is described.

The work of extending user applications for distance learning with QoS is described. The technical performance and user perception of QoS control were tested and evaluated in the trials. The main conclusions and recommendations are discussed. The inte-grated services concept is recommended for use in the access network.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} role and {{importance}} {{of some of the}} key aspects of QoS planning, provisioning, monitoring and optimisation (QoS Management) for UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA) FDD networks {{within the framework of the}} 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP). Firstly, the differences between Quality of end user Experience (QoE) and Quality of Service (QoS) are explained. This is followed by a review of 3 GPP requirements for QoS concept and architecture. Then all models and the main assumptions in this dissertation are presented. Based on these, original QoS mechanisms in the radio <b>access</b> <b>network</b> <b>domain,</b> means and methods for QoS provisioning, planning, monitoring and "optimisation" are discussed. Simulation results showed substantial spectral efficiency gains provided by service (or user) differentiation in UTRAN by means of priorities and differentiated parameter settings. When appropriately configured, the proposed QoS mechanisms can greatly reduce the need for bandwidth. Performance results proved also the proposed virtual time simulator to be an appropriate tool for service driven WCDMA radio interface dimensioning and detailed radio network planning. It is also shown that measuring QoS performance by a proper classification of counters (and or gauges), based on a particular subset of radio access bearer attributes, is a promising technique for assessing performances of service applications through WCDMA networks. With this new method there is no need to trace upper layer protocols at different interfaces or dumping data in mobile terminals. The proposed metrics allow operators to measure the bandwidth required for robust statistical reliability, to assess and exploit statistical sharing of resources, to configure QoS functions effectively, and to monitor QoE. The application of the proposed technique is not limited to the WCDMA Radio Network Subsystem (RNS), yet it can be deployed in any radio access and packet core network supporting mapping of performance indicators onto a particular subset of QoS attributes. Finally, in order to maximise the performance of the available services in UTRAN, at a given QoE, simulation results showed clear needs for the network administrator to adapt the parameter settings to diverse input application traffic conditions and the proposed genetic approach to be an appropriate solution space search algorithm for this purpose. reviewe...|$|E

40|$|IP {{multimedia}} subsystem (IMS) is over IP network architecture, but mobile IP cannot directly support session mobility {{controlled by}} session initiation protocol-based signaling. The long signaling delay for session reestablishment in application layer always results in session interruptions during the handoff. Therefore, handoff poses {{a challenge for}} quality of service (QoS) maintenance in IMS that targets to offer real-time multimedia applications over wireless mobile networks. The existing approaches {{to solve this problem}} depend on the advance resource reservation and the optimization of handoff control. Unfortunately, big cost of the advance resource reservation in neighboring domains is a major problem that leads to a serious signaling load and a waste of wireless bandwidth. To solve this issue, we present an enhanced IMS handoff mechanism (EHM) based on user mobility prediction to save network resources by avoiding multiple useless advance reservations. In addition, to support the heterogeneous <b>access</b> <b>networks</b> in IMS <b>domain,</b> EHM evolves a network selective scheme to utilize the network resources more efficiently. The architecture of EHM and the advance QoS negotiation signaling are also presented. We model the cost, the handoff delay and the session blocking probability for EHM and the previous work.

40|$|Abstract. The Internet {{architecture}} {{is based on}} design principles such as end-to-end addressing and global routeability. It suits relatively static, well-managed and flat network hierarchies. Recent years have shown, however, that the Internet is evolving beyond what the current architecture can support. The Internet architecture struggles to support increasingly conflicting requirements from groups with competing interests, such as network, content and application service providers, or end-users of fixed, mobile and ad hoc <b>access</b> <b>networks.</b> This paper describes a new internetworking architecture, called TurfNet. It pro-vides autonomy for individual <b>network</b> <b>domains,</b> or Turfs, through a novel in-ter-domain communication mechanism that does not require global network addressing or a common network protocol. By minimizing inter-domain de-pendencies, TurfNet provides {{a high degree of}} independence, which in turn fa-cilitates autonomic communications. Allowing <b>network</b> <b>domains</b> to fully oper-ate in isolation maximizes the scope of autonomic management functions. To accomplish this, TurfNet integrates the emerging concept of dynamic network composition with other recent architectural concepts such as decoupling loca-tors from identifiers and establishing end-to-end communication across hetero-geneous domains. ...|$|R
