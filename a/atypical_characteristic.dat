40|$|Metaphor {{comprehension}} {{involves the}} generation of novel se-mantic attributes, especially when a metaphor emphasizes a shared but <b>atypical</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the relevant concepts. The present {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) study explores neural activation during the process of attribute gen-eration known as feature emergence. The participants judged whether a presented semantic feature was an appropriate inter-pretation of a primed metaphor sentence. Two types of features were evaluated: emergent features that are not applicable to the respective concepts and only become salient in a metaphori-cal context and non-emergent features which are typical char-acteristics. In contrast to non-emergent features, processing of emergent features mainly involved prefrontal regions of the right hemisphere, including the precentral gyrus. The present results suggest that feature emergence necessitates a shift of semantic attention that drives a novel metaphor interpretation beyond the semantic elaboration implicated within the left pre-frontal cortex...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Is it {{possible}} {{a correlation between}} some periprosthetic femoral fractures and atypical fractures? CASE: We present {{a case of a}} 77 -year-old woman with atypical periprosthetic femoral fracture. The patient had a history of long-term bisphosphonate use. We performed an open reduction, a synthesis of the fracture and a histological exam. The patient stopped the bisphosphonate (BF) therapy. Three months later, before starting the teriparatide treatment, the patient had a re-fracture so we did a second osteosynthesis and began a teriparatide therapy. After six months, the radiography showed a bone healing at the fracture site. RESULT: The histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of atypical femoral fracture. CONCLUSION: At first, the fracture showed a delayed union which led to a new surgery, as often happens in BF-related atypical fractures. Appropriate treatment (BF suspension and teriparatide beginning) permitted fracture healing. The <b>atypical</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the fracture was confirmed by histological exam. Some periprosthetic femoral fractures in patients treated with BF, especially in long time therapies, should be suspected as atypical fractures and a specific medical treatment should be performed, as well as a correct surgical treatment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{structure}} of 4 -chloro- 3 -fluorobenzaldehyde (CFB, C 7 H 4 ClFO) {{has been characterized}} by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, FT-IR and Raman techniques. The conformational isomers, optimized geometrical parameters, normal mode frequencies and corresponding vibrational assignments of CFB have been examined using the density functional theory method, with the Becke- 3 -Lee–Yang–Parr functional and the 6 - 311 +G(3 df,p) basis set. Reliable vibrational assignments and molecular orbitals have been investigated by the potential energy distribution. CFB crystallizes in monoclinic space group P 21 /c with the O-cis conformation. In order to {{examine the effect of}} fluorine on the conformational preference, the chloro- and bromo-analogs of CFB have also been studied theoretically. It is observed that CFB prefers the O-cis conformation while the chloro- and bromo-analogs prefer the O-trans conformation. Although the free energy difference between the O-cis and O-trans conformers is less than 0. 2 kcal/mol, the free energy rotational barrier is at least 8. 4 kcal/mol [B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 +G(3 df,p) ]. MP 2 /aug-cc-pVDZ computations reveal that these free energies remain almost unaffected. The <b>atypical</b> <b>characteristic</b> of fluorine affecting conformational isomerism is observed. In addition, there is a good agreement between the experimentally determined structural parameters and vibrational frequencies of CFB and those predicted theoretically...|$|E
40|$|The Swedish National Innovation Council (NIC) {{was created}} by the Prime Minister (Stefan Löfven) in February 2015, and it has now been {{operating}} for 18 months. It is personally chaired by the Prime Minister, which is unusual for such councils in other countries. Another <b>atypical</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the Swedish NIC is its dominant and wide focus on innovation rather than on research (for which there is another council in Sweden). The existence of NIC has given innovation policy issues a much higher status and degree of importance both within the government itself and within government agencies, i. e. in the entire state apparatus. NIC has become a major governance instrument in order to transform Swedish innovation policy from being linear towards becoming holistic. The continued separation between innovation policy and research policy is also very important if the linear view shall lose its dominance in the field of innovation policy. The Swedish NIC will be described and analyzed in this paper and its operation will be exemplified by four types of NIC activity. I will show that two of these activities have already been directly successful in influencing innovation policy in practice (state risk capital provision and innovationrelatedpublic procurement) and that an interesting development has been takingplace in the other two (holistic innovation policy and additionality). These examples will be placed within a framework of the relevant innovation theory and of the development of innovation policy in a larger context...|$|E
40|$|Background The case {{presented}} here {{took place in}} the deep south of Italy where, even today in some areas, people continue to hold on to beliefs in magic and superstition. Such ways of thinking have deep roots and hold important cultural significance {{in this part of the}} country. What makes this case so unusual and interesting however, is the way in which the perpetrator went about sexually abusing his daughter: •	Seeking the help of sorcerers. •	Sadistic practices such as injecting sperm into the victim, as well as providing her with food and drink laced with sperm. •	Psychological violence. •	Isolation of the victim. Method We examined the features of the violence perpetrated. An unusual web of ritualistic, mythical, subcultural, and “magical” elements were involved that went far beyond those normally associated with cases of sexual abuse. Another <b>atypical</b> <b>characteristic</b> of this case was the duration of the sexual relations between the father and daughter: 4 years. Results In cases of incest, the adult transforms a child’s dreams of seducing the parent into a nightmare in which the child is actually able to realize his or her goal. The parent should remain impassive in such situations. Whereas the child may only fantasize about sexual or incestuous behavior, adults must understand the difference between infantile phantasms by deciphering the meaning of these fantasies and not permitting them to be acted upon. 	Conclusions 	Unlike a “classic” rape, where the victim feels a sense of separateness from the rapist, the victim of sexual abuse within the family environment finds him or herself in a highly complicated relationship with the perpetrator. Even when these victims have feelings of hate toward the relative, they are unable to experience conflicting tensions and ambiguous emotions: This is particularly damaging to a child as we can see from this case...|$|E

40|$|Activated {{receptor}} tyrosine kinases recruit many signalling proteins {{to initiate}} downstream cell proliferation and survival pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K), a heterodimer {{consisting of a}} p 85 regulatory protein and a p 110 catalytic protein. Our laboratory has previously shown the p 85 α protein also has in vitro GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity towards Rab 5 and Rab 4, small GTPases that regulate vesicle trafficking events for activated receptors. Expression of a p 85 α protein containing an arginine to alanine substitution at position 274 (p 85 R 274 A) that affects its GAP activity, caused sustained levels of activated platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs), enhanced downstream signalling, and resulted in cellular transformation. Together with other data, this suggested that in p 85 R 274 A-expressing cells, PDGFRs are more rapidly trafficked through the endocytic pathway, which reduces opportunities for sorting events necessary for receptor degradation. Our laboratory has observed previously that p 85 was capable of binding to both Rab 5 -GDP, as well as Rab 5 -GTP, which is an <b>atypical</b> <b>characteristic</b> of GAP proteins, whereas p 110 β had previously been reported to bind Rab 5 -GTP selectively. Based on these observations, this thesis project was designed {{to test the hypothesis}} that both proteins contributed GAP activity towards Rab 5, with p 85 providing a catalytic arginine residue (R 274) and p 110 β providing switch stabilization functions specific to the GTP-bound state. To accomplish the thesis objective, cells expressing individual p 85 defects (lacking GAP activity, R 274 A; or lacking p 110 -binding ability through deletion of residues 478 - 513, Δ 110) were compared to cells expressing a double mutant missing both functions. Stable clonal NIH 3 T 3 cell lines were generated and selected in G 418 and clones expressing similar levels of FLAG-tagged p 85 wild type or mutants compared to the control cell lines (NIH 3 T 3, FLAG-vector control, p 85 wild type, and p 85 R 274 A) were chosen for analysis. A time-course of PDGF stimulation showed that cells expressing p 85 R 274 A or p 85 Δ 110 +R 274 A have sustained phosphorylation levels of the PDGFR, reduced rates of PDGFR degradation and sustained MAPK/Erk signalling. Contrary to the cellular transformation previously reported for p 85 R 274 A-expressing cells, expression of p 85 Δ 110 +R 274 A did not lead to cellular transformation. These divergent results suggest that p 85 -associated p 110 serves two functions. As the catalytic subunit of PI 3 K, one function is the localized generation of PI 3, 4, 5 P 3 lipids at the plasma membrane for Akt activation, and possibly during receptor endocytosis where it could impact MAPK/Erk activation/deactivation kinetics and cell transformation. These results support a second function for p 110 in the regulation of PDGFR activation/deactivation kinetics and PDGFR half-life, both strongly influenced by alterations in PDGFR trafficking. This suggests that p 110 β may regulate PDGFR trafficking by providing Rab 5 -GTP switch stabilization that complements the catalytic arginine residue (R 274) within p 85, and that p 85 α and p 110 β work together as a Rab 5 GAP. The role of PDGFR in the localization of the RabGAP function of p 85 to specific subcellular compartments was also examined. It was hypothesized that PDGFR may help localize the RabGAP function of p 85 to vesicles containing Rab 5 or Rab 4 through the binding of p 85 to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on activated PDGFR. Stable cell lines expressing individual p 85 defects (lacking GAP activity, R 274 A; or lacking PDGFR-binding ability through site-directed mutation of residues 358 and 649 from arginine to alanine, ΔR; or a double mutant missing both functions) demonstrated that p 85 R 274 A or p 85 ΔR+R 274 A expression leads to sustained PDGFR activation and signalling, and to delayed PDGFR degradation in response to PDGF stimulation. The sustained signalling observed resulted in cellular transformation in cells expressing p 85 R 274 A or p 85 ΔR+R 274 A. The data suggests that PDGFR does not {{play a role in the}} localization of the RabGAP activity of p 85. The findings of this study elucidates important non-canonical functions of the PI 3 K heterodimer and contributes to our understanding of how specific mutations in both p 85 and p 110 β within regions implicated in the regulation of RabGAP activity can alter signalling events and lead to enhancement of tumour-associated phenotypes...|$|E
