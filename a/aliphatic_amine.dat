40|$|Aliphatic amines {{can form}} {{secondary}} aerosol via oxidation with atmospheric radicals (e. g., hydroxyl radical and nitrate radical). The particle can contain both secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and inorganic salts. The ratio of organic to inorganic {{materials in the}} particulate phase influences aerosol hygroscopicity and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity. SOA formed from trimethylamine (TMA) and butylamine (BA) reactions with hydroxyl radical (OH) is composed of organic material of low hygroscopicity (single hygroscopicity parameter, κ, ≤ 0. 25). Secondary aerosol formed from the tertiary <b>aliphatic</b> <b>amine</b> (TMA) with N 2 O 5 (source of nitrate radical, NO 3) contains less volatile compounds than the primary <b>aliphatic</b> <b>amine</b> (BA) aerosol. As relative humidity (RH) increases, inorganic amine salts are formed {{as a result of}} acid–base reactions. The CCN activity of the humid TMA–N 2 O 5 aerosol obeys Zdanovskii, Stokes, and Robinson (ZSR) ideal mixing rules. The humid BA + N 2 O 5 aerosol products were found to be very sensitive to the temperature at which the measurements were made within the streamwise continuous-flow thermal gradient CCN counter; κ ranges from 0. 4 to 0. 7 dependent on the instrument supersaturation (ss) settings. The variance of the measured aerosol κ values indicates that simple ZSR rules cannot be applied to the CCN results from the primary <b>aliphatic</b> <b>amine</b> system. Overall, <b>aliphatic</b> <b>amine</b> aerosol systems' κ ranges within 0. 2 < κ < 0. 7. This work indicates that aerosols formed via nighttime reactions with amines are likely to produce hygroscopic and volatile aerosol, whereas photochemical reactions with OH produce secondary organic aerosol of lower CCN activity. The contributions of semivolatile secondary organic and inorganic material from aliphatic amines must be considered for accurate hygroscopicity and CCN predictions from <b>aliphatic</b> <b>amine</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|A {{study on}} {{secondary}} organic aerosol (SOA) {{was conducted with}} a focus on correlating the chemical and physical characteristics with aerosol's ability acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). The work focuses on three types of aerosol: beta-caryophyllene ozonolysis SOA, <b>aliphatic</b> <b>amine</b> SOA, and cigarette environmental tobacco smoke. The work on beta-caryophyllene ozonolysis SOA enhances our understanding of the CCN activity of SOA formed with and without the presence of isoprene, by probing the effects of a series of environmental parameters on the formation and properties of SOA with more ambient-relevant precursor concentrations. This study demonstrates that aerosol formed from ozonolysis of a mixture of low and high molecular weight terpenes can be hygroscopic and can contribute to the global biogenic SOA CCN budget. The <b>aliphatic</b> <b>amine</b> work explores the atmospheric behaviors of amines with typical atmospheric oxidants, e. g. nitrate radical, hydroxyl radical and ozone. This study shows that night time chemistry of aliphatic amines can produce secondary organic and inorganic aerosol mixtures, and the relative contribution of each component depends on the environment relative humidity. Thus, modelers need to include as much ambient data as possible in order to mimic the amine behavior in the real atmosphere. The hygroscopicity of <b>aliphatic</b> <b>amine</b> secondary aerosol is also investigated, focusing on the correlation between complex composition and aerosol CCN activity. Despite of measurement artifacts, primary <b>aliphatic</b> <b>amine</b> aerosol is composed of highly volatile components with high hygroscopicity. The third part of the work characterizes the environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) from research cigarettes, with an emphasis on enhanced condensational growth (ECG), represented by CCN activity and droplet formation properties.
