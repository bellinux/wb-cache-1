500|$|The Archbishop of Ohrid, Atanasije, {{after his}} {{movement}} had largely failed in Albania, {{was now in}} Rome. [...] The Serb uprising had no better luck; the Herzegovinian tribes, Drobnjaci, Nikšić and Piva began fighting, but were defeated at the field of Gacko (Gatačko Polje) by Dervish Bey sometime in 1597. According to the Venetian Lazzaro Soranzo (1599), the Piperi, Kuči, Klimenti, Bjelopavlići and others tried to liberate themselves from Ottoman tyranny, and upon hearing the false claim that Sultan Mehmed III lost the battle and his life at the Siege of Eger, [...] "they all rose up {{under the command of}} vojvoda Grdan and there was a great slaughter of Turks who were on their land. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> find out more, I heard the contrary, that they unhappily withdrew into their mountains"; Montenegrin historian Gligor Stanojević, based on Soranzo's account, which he described as [...] "the most interesting and most contradicting note on the movement of the Brda and Herzegovina tribes in this time", believed that the rebellion did not have the scale of a national uprising.|$|E
500|$|Jumpers was {{scheduled}} to appear at the National Theatre {{at the start of}} 1972, but encountered problems when the theatre's director, Laurence Olivier, called the play [...] "unintelligible" [...] before walking out during the first read-through in disgust. Despite this, rehearsals went ahead, which the cast found difficult; the play featured many scenes, a complicated script, and relied heavily on the opening scene, a sceptical speech about the existence of God which lasted 13 minutes. In his autobiography, Hordern commented: [...] "Each day my fists would sink into my cardigan pockets <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> make sense of it all." [...] In a meeting shortly before the opening night, Olivier complained to Stoppard that the play was overlong and, in some parts, laborious. Stoppard agreed to reduce the epilogue by half. The decision angered Hordern as it meant the extra stress of learning a new script at short notice. [...] He vented his frustrations on Wood who agreed to leave his character alone and instead to cut many of the other scenes. The final dress rehearsal also experienced disruption when the revolving stage broke down and had to be fixed half-way through. The problems had ceased by the opening performance the following evening; it was a night which Hordern called [...] "unbelievable, {{one of the highlights of}} my career". [...] The actress Maureen Lipman, who was in the audience on the opening night, said that her husband, the playwright Jack Rosenthal, had [...] "laughed so hard he thought he was going to be seriously ill".|$|E

2500|$|John Grieve {{said the}} {{avalanche}} was initiated by a climber who dislodged a huge sheet of snow, sending {{it down on}} the nine other climbers who were swept [...] downhill. The climber avoided being swept away by digging into the mountain with his ice axe before he composed himself to alert the emergency services. The surviving climbers had begun to unearth their friends' bodies from the snow with their ice axes by the time the rescue team had arrived. Fifty-year-old Jim Coyne from Lindsayfield, East Kilbride, said he and 53-year-old David Barr from Paisley, were on the mountain when a slab of snow came away from the peak. Barr sustained the shoulder injury. Coyne told of how they were just below the summit when the avalanche occurred, describing it as [...] "massive" [...] and saying they were ... engulfed and I managed to dig my way out. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> get my bearings I saw an arm sticking out of the snow. It was Davie. I dug for 10 minutes using just my hands to get him free. 54-year-old Tom Richardson, an experienced climber from Sheffield in England, also had a narrow escape and subsequently alerted the emergency services.|$|E
