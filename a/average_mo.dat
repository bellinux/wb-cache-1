40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the development of methods for stable isotope metabolic tracer studies in living systems using inductively coupled plasma single and dual quadrupole mass spectrometers. Sub-nanogram per gram levels of molybdenum (Mo) from human blood plasma are isolated by the use of anion exchange alumina microcolumns. Million-fold more concentrated spectral and matrix interferences such as sodium, chloride, sulfate, phosphate, etc. in the blood constituents are removed from the analyte. The recovery of Mo from the alumina column is 82 {+-} 5 % (n = 5). Isotope dilution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ID-ICP-MS) is utilized for the quantitative ultra-trace concentration determination of Mo in bovine and human blood samples. The <b>average</b> <b>Mo</b> concentration in reference bovine serum determined by this method is 10. 2 {+-} 0. 4 ng/g, while the certified value is 11. 5 {+-} 1. 1 ng/g (95 % confidence interval). The Mo concentration of one pool of human blood plasma from two healthy male donors is 0. 5 {+-} 0. 1 ng/g. The inductively coupled plasma twin quadrupole mass spectrometer (ICP-TQMS) is used to measure the carbon isotope ratio from non-volatile organic compounds and bio-organic molecules to assess the ability as an alternative analytical method to gas chromatography combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-combustion-IRMS).

Trytophan, myoglobin, and beta-cyclodextrin are chosen for the study, initial observation of spectral interference of 13 C+ with 12 C 1 H+ comes from the incomplete dissociation of myoglobin and/or beta-cyclodextrin. The interference species is most sensitive to the aerosol gas flow rate. Carefully decreasing this parameter can eliminate 12 C 1 H+ interference. 13 C/ 12 C ratios in myoglobin and beta-cyclodextrin can be determined precisely and quantitatively. The best relative standard deviation (RSD%) obtained in the 13 C/ 12 C study is 0. 91 %, which is close to the limiting precision predicted by counting statistics (1. 16 %);Many improvements have been made to the current ICP-TQMS device. A new skimmer interface together with the new ion optics arrangement improves the ion collection efficiency 19 -fold. A second-generation ion beam splitter has been designed to reduce the background count rate and improve the ion transmission. A modified ion beam splitter transmits 5 times more ions while maintaining the performance characteristics of the ICP-TQMS system. The precision is further improved by measuring each data point for a longer dwell time (9 s instead of 1. 5 s) and keeping the total ion collection time low (≤ 50 s instead of 150 s) ...|$|E

We conducted a sequential fractionation study {{to provide an}} insight into solubility of Sulfur (S) and Molybdenum (Mo) in flooded alluvial paddy soils. The samples (0 – 15 and 15 – 30  cm) were taken from marine and riverine alluvial soils in Kedah and Kelantan areas, respectively, and were sequentially extracted with NaHCO 3, NaOH, HCl, and HClO 4 –HNO 3. Total S in upper and lower layers of Kedah and Kelantan ranged between 273 and 1121  mg kg− 1, and 177 to 1509  mg kg− 1, respectively. In upper layers and subsoil of Kedah, <b>average</b> total <b>Mo</b> were 0. 34 and 0. 27  mg kg− 1, respectively. <b>Average</b> total <b>Mo</b> in Kelantan were 0. 25  mg kg− 1 (surface layer) and 0. 28  mg kg− 1 (subsoil).

40|$|Squamous cell {{carcinoma}} of the bladder comprises less than 5 % of all bladder cancers in the United States and its long-term prognosis has remained controversial. We examined a large series of patients who underwent radical and partial cystectomies for squamous {{cell carcinoma}} to identify associated histopathologic findings and clinical outcomes associated with these tumors. Patient age ranged from 46 to 83 years (average 68. 5 y) with a male:female ratio of 3 : 2. Forty-three patients were white and 2 patients were African-American. No patient {{had a history of}} schistosomal infection and only 1 patient had a history of condyloma acuminatum. The majority of patients with reported signs and symptoms presented with hematuria (n= 3 D 29 / 34), with the remainder presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms. Tumor size ranged from 0. 8 to 6. 4 cm (average 3. 8 cm). Invasion was identified into the lamina propria (pT 1, n= 3 D 1 / 45), muscularis propria (pT 2, n= 3 D 14 / 45), perivesical fat (pT 3, n= 3 D 27 / 45), and adjacent structures (pT 4, n= 3 D 3 / 45). Concurrent metastases were identified in 11 of 45 patients (24 %) to pelvic lymph nodes (n= 3 D 9), perivesical lymph nodes (n= 3 D 3), obturator lymph nodes (n= 3 D 1), and bowel wall (n= 3 D 1). Most tumors were moderately (n= 3 D 29 / 45) or poorly (n= 3 D 13 / 45) differentiated, whereas only 3 tumors were well differentiated (n= 3 D 3 / 45). Keratinization was present in all cases within the invasive component and ranged from 5 % to 95 % of tumor bulk. Necrosis ranged from 0 % to 60 % and inversely correlated with tumor differentiation. Eighteen cases demonstrated a prominent giant cell reaction to keratin, and 30 tumors were associated with a desmoplastic reaction. Extensive perineural (n= 3 D 11 / 45) and angiolymphatic invasion (n= 3 D 7 / 45) were identified in a subset of tumors. The majority of cases demonstrated associated superficial lesions including keratinizing squamous metaplasia (n= 3 D 28 / 45), nonkeratinizing squamous metaplasia (n= 3 D 20 / 45), squamous cell carcinoma in situ (n= 3 D 16 / 45), squamous metaplasia with dysplasia (n= 3 D 4 / 45), verrucous squamous hyperplasia (n= 3 D 3 / 45), and extensive condyloma acuminatum (n= 3 D 1 / 45). Seven cases additionally demonstrated separate small foci of focal flat urothelial carcinoma in situ. Three cases demonstrated a markedly atypical squamous lining of the prostatic ducts at the prostatic urethra. Clinical follow-up was available on 35 patients (78 %) and ranged from 1 to 175 months (<b>average</b> 33 <b>mo,</b> median 15 mo). Two patients developed recurrent local disease (n= 3 D 2 / 35, 6 %) and 13 patients developed subsequent metastatic disease (n= 3 D 13 / 35, 37 %). Ten patients were dead of disease (29 %), with a time to death for most patients of less than 2 years (range 2 to 21 <b>mo,</b> <b>average</b> 10. 5 <b>mo).</b> Thirty-seven percent of patients (n= 3 D 13 / 35) were alive without disease.

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} the efficacy {{and success of}} percutaneous aspiration irrigation and reaspiration (PAIR) {{in the management of}} hepatic hydatidosis. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with 32 hepatic hydatid cysts had PAIR. Twenty-two patients received at least 2 wk of drug therapy before the procedure was carried out {{to reduce the risk of}} recurrence from spillage during the procedure. The procedure was performed under local anesthesia with a 19 -gauge 20 cm long needle, the cyst was punctured, cystic content (approximately 30 mL) was aspirated by a 12 - 14 F pigtail catheter and aspirated fluids were sent for analysis. Once the cyst was almost empty, two-thirds of the net amount of material aspirated was replaced by hypertonic saline and left in the cavity for about 30 min, with the catheter left in place for reaspiration of most of the fluid. When the amount of fluid drained was less than 10 mL per 24 h, the drainage catheter was removed. RESULTS: All 32 cysts showed evidence of immediate collapse after completion of the procedure, and before discharge from hospital, ultrasound examination showed fluid reaccumulation in all cysts. Serial follow-up showed a progressive decrease in the size and change in the appearance of cysts. To confirm the sterility of these cystic cavities, seven cysts were reaspirated on <b>average</b> 3 <b>mo</b> after the procedure. Investigations revealed no viable scolices.

RESULTS: There were 23 patients(35 eyes) with orbit IgG 4 -RD(8 male patients, 9 eyes; 15 female patients, 26 eyes), {{with an average age}} of 52. 1 year-old(from age 28 to 72). 19 patients(30 eyes) occured in lacrimal gland and 4 cases(5 eyes) in other places, and they went to hospital for lacrimal gland cyst or exophthalmos. There were 11 cases in one side and 12 cases in both sides. The disease lasted from 1 mo to 10 a, <b>averaging</b> 27 <b>mo.</b> It recureded in one patient(1 eye) after 1 mo. In general inspection: Gray nodular goiter, thin fibrous coat wrapping around the lacrimal gland could be observed. Histologic characteristics: lacrimal gland bubble and catheter group shrinked or even disappeared, substituted by lymphocyte, plasma cells and lymphoid follicle and accompanied with fibrosis. Immunohistochemical staining: IgG 4 positive plasma cells of 23 cases(35 eyes) was > 50 /HPF, and IgG 4 /IgG ratio of positive plasma cells was > 40 %. CONCLUSION: Orbit IgG 4 -RD mainly occures in lacrimal gland tissue, and expression of IgG 4 can be detected through histologic characteristics and immunohistochemical staining.

In the absence of a universally accepted zero-delta reference material, different groups report their data relative to their adopted in-house standards. Rigorous comparison of results generated in different laboratories using different analytical approaches is only possible if the in-house standards are of identical Mo isotope composition. To determine potential isotopic differences among various standards, the ? 98 Mo (98 Mo/ 95 Mo) values of ten Mo standard solutions were measured as part of this study. For six of these solutions, four laboratories carried out an intercalibration. In contrast to previous results, ? 98 Mo of various in-house standards were found to differ by up to 0. 37 ‰. Renormalisation of our new and published Mo-isotope data available for seawater taken from various sites and the USGS rock reference material SDO- 1 relative to NIST-SRM- 3134, provides a much better agreement among reported ? 98 Mo values for these samples.

These cattle comprised Australia's "Southern Crossbreeding Project. " Heifers were slaughtered at an <b>average</b> of 16 <b>mo</b> with hot standard carcass weight of 219 kg and 9 mm fat over the rump. Steers were slaughtered at an <b>average</b> of 23 <b>mo</b> with carcass weight of 319 kg and 13 mm fat over the rump. Meat and fat samples {{were taken from}} the carcass on the day after slaughter for subsequent laboratory analysis of i. m. fat content and fatty acid composition. Data were analyzed using uni- and bivariate animal models containing fixed effects of cohort, management group, birth month, and sire breed. March-born calves had fat with a 0. 5 °C lower melting point, 0. 6 % higher total monounsaturated fatty acids, and 0. 7 % higher fatty acid desaturation index than calves born in April. Steers born in 1997 were the only cohort finished on pasture, and they had much more yellow fat than the other cohorts. Four heavy breed crosses (Angus, South Devon, Limousin, and Belgian Blue) averaged 284 kg carcass weight, followed by purebred Hereford (268 kg), Wagyu (244 kg) and Jersey (236 kg). Angus had the greatest fat depth (14. 3 mm), ahead of Hereford and Wagyu (11. 9 mm), Jersey (10. 7 mm), South Devon and Limousin (9. 9 mm) and Belgian Blue (8. 0 mm). Jersey, Wagyu, and Angus had the most i. m. fat (4. 6 %), followed by Hereford and South Devon (3. 8 %), and Limousin and Belgian Blue (3. 1 %). The highly marbled Jersey and Wagyu had softer fat (6 % lower fat melting point) than the other breeds. Angus were more highly marbled, similar to Jersey and Wagyu, but had harder fat similar to the leaner breeds. Heritabilities for all traits were low to moderate (16 to 36 %). Genetic correlations between fatty acid composition and carcass traits were not significant, indicating little evidence of antagonisms between traits that would prevent genetic progress in both production and quality...|$|R
40|$|Background: Plasma {{fatty acids}} (FAs) and micronutrients have been {{associated}} with central obesity in adults; however, previous studies of these associations in adults have yielded mixed results. In addition, no comparable research has been conducted among youth with type 1 diabetes (T 1 D). Objective: We investigated the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between plasma nutrient biomarkers and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) in youth with T 1 D. Methods: These analyses included 1324 youth aged 3 – 20 y at T 1 D diagnosis with a baseline visit in the SEARCH (Search for Diabetes in Youth) Study and a subset of 1178 of these youth with a follow-up visit an <b>average</b> of 23 <b>mo</b> (range: 16 – 40 mo) after their baseline visit. Plasma phospholipid FAs and vitamins were measured, and estimated desaturase activities were calculated at baseline. Anthropometric measurements and diabetes-related assessments were collected at each visit. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the association between plasma nutrient biomarkers and WHtR. Results: In cross-sectional analysis, plasma palmitic acid (P = 0. 004), dihomo-g-linolenic acid (DGLA; P = 0. 017) and D...|$|R

40|$|When {{measuring}} breath-by-breath (BbB) {{oxygen uptake}} {{at the mouth}} (V MO 2) as {{the difference between the}} amount of inspired and expired oxygen, BbB variation in lung oxygen stores due to BbB variation in end-expiratory lung volume (VLET) introduces an error leading to a decreased signal-to-noise ratio when compared to oxygen uptake at the alveolo-capillary interface (V AO 2). Conventional BbB measurement of oxygen uptake does not measure BbB changes in lung oxygen stores. Opto-electronic plethysmography(OEP) allows accurate monitoring of absolute lung volume changes and BbB quantification of change in pulmonary oxygen stores. To quantify BbB variation of lung oxygen stores and to assess variability in V MO 2 due to BbB variation of lung oxygen stores, we measured, V MO 2 and V AO 2 in parallel, at rest,during transients and during steady state cycling exercise at 60, 90 and 120 W in 7 healthy male subjects. <b>Average</b> V <b>MO</b> 2 and V AO 2 at steady state were not different (p = 0. 328). Direct measurement of V AO 2 reduced overall BbB variability by 24 % (p < 0. 0001) and variance of the difference between V MO 2 and V AO 2 could be explained for 55 % by BbB changes in VLET and expiratory oxygen fraction. V AO 2 was higher than V MO 215 and 30 s after exercise onset (p < 0. 01). We conclude that (1) by taking into account changes in lung oxygen stores BbB variability of oxygen uptake is reduced, (2) alveolar oxygen stores change rapidly during transients to exercise, and (3) changes in alveolar oxygen stores affect BbB oxygen uptake measured at the mouth during the cardio-dynamic phase I...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} {{long-term}} benefits of shortened constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) in the subacute phase poststroke. DESIGN: A 1 -year follow-up after shortened CIMT (3 h training/d for 2 wk) where {{the participants had}} been randomized to a mitt group or a nonmitt group. SETTING: A university hospital rehabilitation department. PARTICIPANTS: Poststroke patients (N= 20, 15 men, 5 women; mean age 58. 8 y; on <b>average</b> 14. 8 <b>mo</b> poststroke) with mild to moderate impairments of hand function. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Sollerman hand function test, the modified Motor Assessment Scale, and the Motor Activity Log test. Assessments were made by blinded observers. RESULTS: One year after shortened CIMT, participants within both the mitt group and the nonmitt group showed statistically significant improvements in arm and hand motor performance and on self-reported motor ability compared with before and after treatment. No {{significant differences between the}} groups were found in any measure at any time. CONCLUSIONS: Shortened CIMT seems to be beneficial up to 1 year after training, but the restraint may not enhance upper motor function. To determine which components of CIMT are most effective, larger randomized studies are needed...|$|R

At the Long Island Jewish-Hillside Medical Center, 42 patients 70 to 79 years old underwent 43 open heart procedures in the past 7 years. Their average age was 73 years and 62 % were male. Eighteen underwent aortic valve replacement; 7 had mitral valve replacement; 18 had coronary bypasses (3 with valve replacement); exploration for pul-monary embolism was done in 1; 1 patient had tricuspid replacement with mitral commissurotomy; 17 % (7 / 42) died during hospitalization or within 30 days of surgery.

40|$|Kadcyla is a {{drug that}} extends the life of breast cancer {{patients}} by an <b>average</b> of 6 <b>mo.</b> It {{also happens to be}} incredibly expensive. The United Kingdom’s National Health Service sparked controversy when it refused to provide this drug to patients, citing its low cost effectiveness. Cases like this raise the question of how societies should make distributive decisions. Should we maximize utility or should we aim {{to improve the lives of}} the least fortunate, even if doing so is costly for everyone else? The influential philosopher John Rawls tackled this dilemma by framing fair distributive decisions as a kind of gamble (1). Rawls famously argued that we should choose the kind of society we would all prefer if our choice was made from behind a “veil of ignorance” — that is, under conditions of complete uncertainty about where we would end up. He held that people should make such choices by following a risk-averse “maximin” strategy of maximizing the minimum possible outcome for themselves and others. Echoing Rawls’s theory, new research by Kameda et al. (2) links risk and fairness by showing that preferences about risk and about distribution may arise from common psychological and neural substrates...|$|R
40|$|Films of Al, Al 2 O 3, Mo and MoSix {{were formed}} by ion beam {{assisted}} deposition (IBAD) at R ratios between 0. 004 and 0. 1 and film thicknesses between 150 and 1100 nm. Al films were crystalline {{with a strong}} (111) fiber texture becoming more pronounced and azimuthally oriented with increasing R ratio. Mo films were crystalline with strong (110) texture and a distinct azimuthal texture indicative of planar channeling of the ion beam along (110) _planes. The microstructure of Al films is characterized by large columnar grains at R = 0 with breakup starting at R = 0 04, while that of Mo films showed little change with increasing R ratio. Al 2 O 3 and MoSix films are amorphous under all deposition conditions. The average stress in oxide and silicide films is tensile at R = 0 and becomes compressive with increased values of the normalized energy, saturating at ~ 15 eV/atom.

40|$|A {{critical}} link {{missing from}} {{our understanding of}} the nursery role of specific marine habitats is the evidence of connectivity between juvenile and adult habitats. This paper reviews and evaluates evidence of, and spatial scales for, movements from juvenile to adult habitats and it summarises the methods used to study movements. Examples include many fish families but few invertebrate taxa, and most are species of economic importance for USA and Australia. The types of juvenile habitat range from the entire estuary or shallow open coastal waters to specific habitats within estuaries or coastal waters; in some cases juvenile habitats include habitats not traditionally regarded as nursery areas (e. g. the surf zone). The duration of time spent in juvenile habitats <b>averages</b> 13 <b>mo</b> (range 8 d to 5 yr). The majority of organisms move distances of kilometres to hundreds of kilometres from juvenile to adult habitats, although the scale of movements ranged from metres to thousands of kilometres. Changes in abundance among separate habitats and the progression of size classes among separate habitats are the main methods used to infer movement and habitat connectivity. Spatial partitioning of stages of maturity, natural parasites, and a variety of artificial tagging methods have also been used. The latter will become more useful with continued developments in the miniaturisation of artificial tags. More recent studies have used natural tags (e. g. trace elements and stable isotopes) and these methods show great promise for determining movements from juvenile to adult habitats. Few studies provide good evidence for movement from specific juvenile habitats to adult habitats. Future studies need to focus on this movement to supplement data on density, growth and survival of organisms in putative nursery habitats. Such information will allow management and conservation efforts to focus on those habitats that make the greatest contribution to adult populations. Bronwyn M. Gillanders, Kenneth W.

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} {{and safety of}} imaging-guided percutaneous cecostomy {{in the management of}} pediatric patients with organic fecal incontinence. METHODS: Twenty three cecostomies were performed on 21 children with organic fecal incontinence (13 males, 8 females), aged from 5 to 16 years (mean 9. 5 years). Thirteen patients had neurogenic fecal incontinence and 8 patients had anorectal anomalies. Procedures were performed under general anesthesia and fluoroscopic guidance. Effectiveness and complication data were obtained for at least 1 year after the procedure. RESULTS: Cecostomy was successful in 20 patients (primary technical success rate 95 %). Cecostomy failed in one patient due to tube breakage (secondary technical success rate 100 %). The tubes were in situ for an <b>average</b> of 18 <b>mo</b> (range 12 - 23 mo). Eighteen patients (87 %) expressed satisfaction with the procedures. Resolution of soiling was achieved in all patients with neurogenic fecal incontinence (100 %) and in 5 of 8 patients with anorectal anomalies (62. 5 %). Eleven patients (52 %) experienced minor problems. No major complications were noted. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous cecostomy improves {{the quality of life in}} children with organic fecal incontinence.
