By early 1918, 50,000 Turks in the theatre were tying down a British Empire ration strength of over 400,000 (of whom almost half were non-combatants, and 117,471 were British troops).|$|E
25|$|Sheriff McCleary {{resisted}} {{attempts to}} call for state intervention until 10 a.m. on July 7. In a telegram to Gov. Pattison, he described how his deputies and the Carnegie men had been driven off, and noted that the workers and their supporters actively resisting the landing numbered nearly 5,000. Pattison responded by requiring McCleary to exhaust every effort to restore the peace. McCleary <b>asked</b> <b>again</b> for help at noon, and Pattison responded by asking how many deputies the sheriff had. A third telegram, sent at 3:00p.m., again elicited a response from the governor exhorting McCleary to raise his own troops.|$|E

25|$|England {{travelled}} to Sri Lanka for a seven match ODI series. They {{lost the}} first two matches to go 2-0 down in the series, but won the third match. After losing the next match, England again won to keep the series alive at 3-2. However, they were comprehensively beaten {{in the final two}} matches of the series which led to questions being <b>asked</b> <b>again</b> of Alistair Cook. Throughout the tour Moores had remained loyal to Cook, but after the final game he hinted that there may be changes. Cook was later removed as ODI captain, with Eoin Morgan taking over.|$|E
25|$|Joshua B. Bolten, upon {{becoming}} President Bush's {{chief of}} staff in April 2006, pressed for Miers' resignation, but Bush rejected the idea. After the 2006 elections, when Democrats won a majority of both chambers of Congress, Bolten <b>asked</b> <b>again</b> for her departure, arguing that the president needed an aggressive lawyer and increased staff for the Office of Legal Counsel to fend off congressional inquiries and subpoenas. The second effort succeeded; Miers announced her resignation January 4, 2007 and left January 31, 2007. In April 2007, Miers rejoined her previous firm, Locke Liddell & Sapp, and became a partner in its litigation and public policy group. She maintains offices in Austin, Dallas, and Washington, D.C. The firm is now known as Locke Lord.|$|E

Lord wanted to know if they were company signals, that is, coloured flares used for identification. Stone said {{that he did not know}} and that the rockets were all white. Captain Lord instructed the crew to continue to signal the other vessel with the Morse lamp, and went back to sleep. Three more rockets were observed at 1:50a.m. and Stone noted that the ship looked strange in the water, as if she were listing. At 2:15a.m., Lord was notified that the ship could no longer be seen. Lord <b>asked</b> <b>again</b> if the lights had had any colours in them, and he was informed that they were all white.|$|E

The French accepted some wine and preserves; {{but would not}} take more, knowing the fate of their companions. Then Ribault, pointing to the bodies of his comrades, which were visible from where he stood, said {{that they might have}} been tricked into the belief that Fort Caroline was taken, referring to a story he had heard from a barber who had survived the first massacre by feigning death when he was struck down, and had then escaped. But Ribault was soon convinced of his mistake, for he was allowed to converse privately with two Frenchmen captured at Fort Caroline. Then he turned to Menéndez and <b>asked</b> <b>again</b> for ships with which to return to France. The Spaniard was unyielding, and Ribault returned to his companions to acquaint them with the results of the interview.|$|E
500|$|Impossible Princess {{has been}} widely {{considered}} as Minogue's most personal and experimental work to date, and is thus far her only release where she plays the role as a co-producer and composer. Despite this, she identified the album's release period as her most disappointing moment in her career. Minogue has commented {{that if she had}} written another album again, she would consider it as Impossible Princess part two, but vowed never to do such thing again, as she feels it would [...] "get equally critiqued on". When <b>asked</b> <b>again</b> in 2015, she confirmed she would never created another album like Impossible Princess.|$|E

500|$|Michael <b>asked</b> <b>again</b> for {{assistance}} from Emperor Rudolf {{during a visit}} in Prague between 23 February and 5 March 1601, which was granted when the emperor heard that General Giorgio Basta had lost control of Transylvania to the Hungarian nobility led by Sigismund Báthory, who accepted Ottoman protection. Meanwhile, forces loyal to Michael in Wallachia led by his son, Nicolae Pătraşcu, drove Simion Movilă out of Moldavia and prepared to reenter Transylvania. Michael, allied with Basta, defeated the Hungarian army in Battle of Guruslău. A few days later Basta, who sought to control Transylvania himself, executed the assassination of Michael by {{the order of the}} Habsburgian Emperor; it took place near Câmpia Turzii on 9 August 1601.

500|$|Liddell {{also claimed}} that the {{prominent}} occultist Aleister Crowley had been initiated {{into one of these}} nine covens as a young man. According to this account, Crowley had been introduced to the coven in 1899 or 1900 by his magical mentor, Allan Bennett. Liddell asserted that Crowley was subsequently ejected from the coven for his misbehaviour. As evidence for these claims, he stated that his own grandfather had been present on three occasions at which Bennett and Crowley met with Pickingill, and that he had seen a photograph in which the three figures are together. When asked to present this photograph for public scrutiny in 1977, Liddell claimed that it was [...] "not available"; when independently <b>asked</b> <b>again</b> in 1983, he asserted that it had been stolen by [...] "interested parties".|$|E

500|$|When {{the trades}} {{indicated}} production on Antz, Lasseter, feeling betrayed, called Katzenberg {{and asked him}} bluntly if it were true, who in turn asked him where {{he had heard the}} rumor. Lasseter <b>asked</b> <b>again,</b> and Katzenberg admitted it was true. Lasseter raised his voice and would not believe Katzenberg's story that a development director had pitched him the idea long ago. Katzenberg claimed Antz came from a 1991 story pitch by Tim Johnson that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994. Another source gives Nina Jacobson, one of Katzenberg's executives, as the person responsible for the Antz pitch. Lasseter, who normally did not use profane language, cursed at Katzenberg and hung up the phone. Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was [...] "out to get him" [...] and that he realized that he was just cannon fodder in Katzenberg's fight with Disney. In truth, Katzenberg was the victim of a conspiracy: Eisner had decided not to pay him his contract-required bonus, convincing Disney's board not to give him anything. Katzenberg was further angered by the fact that Eisner scheduled Bugs to open the same week as The Prince of Egypt, which was then intended to be DreamWorks' first animated release. Lasseter grimly relayed the news to Pixar employees but kept morale high. Privately, Lasseter told other Pixar executives that he and Stanton felt terribly let down by Katzenberg.|$|E
500|$|Mahendra Kumar, one of {{the leaders}} of the Hindu militant youth organisation, denied that any Catholic churches were {{attacked}} by his group but reportedly accepted responsibility for the attacks on prayer halls belonging to the New Life Fellowship Trust. He stated that the Bajrang Dal were not against Christianity in the region, but were offended by the alleged forced conversions. Kumar had initially denied any involvement in the attacks before being arrested on 20 September. When <b>asked</b> <b>again</b> at a later date however if he had accepted responsibility for the attacks, he denied it. Kumar resigned from Bajrang Dal on 1 October 2008 after witnessing a Hindu woman who had decided to commit suicide with her three children but was saved by Christian missionaries. He stated [...] "That was the time I realised that life is more important than dharma (religion). A lot needs to be done for the betterment of life. My dream is to build a society that values life more than religion. In jail I read several literary works. I joined Bajrang Dal so that we could mobilise the youth for a good cause, but at the end of the day all our concepts were politically motivated." [...] In February 2011, after the commission reports into the attacks were published, Kumar formally apologised to the public for the attacks and accused the BJP Government of corruption. On 21 February 2011 he joined the JDS, declaring, [...] "I am today shedding the shackles of communalism to strive for communal harmony, for which the JDS is working." [...] His successor Suryanarayana also denied any involvement in the attacks. Some pro-Hindu elements believed that the attacks were politically motivated by the main opposition parties in the state rather than being purely based upon religious indifference, especially the Milagres Church attack.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in England in June 1858, Morphy promptly challenged Staunton to a match. At first, Staunton declined Morphy's offer {{saying that the}} challenge came too late. Morphy did not give up negotiations and urging Staunton to play. In early July Staunton agreed provided he was given {{time to get back}} into practice on openings and endgames, and provided that he could manage all this without breaking the publication contract for his Shakespearean work. In early August, Morphy wrote asking Staunton when the match could occur, and Staunton <b>asked</b> <b>again</b> for a delay of some weeks. Staunton competed in a tournament that started in on 22 August in Birmingham, but this was a knock-out tournament and he was eliminated in the second round by Johann Löwenthal, after playing a total of four games. This was to be Staunton's last public chess competition. H. J. R. Murray wrote that Staunton had overexerted himself and damaged his health by trying both to get ahead of schedule on the Shakespeare project and to play some competitive chess. Just before Staunton left London for Birmingham, his old enemy George Walker published an article accusing him of trying to delay the match indefinitely, and Staunton received another letter from Morphy pressing him to name a date for the match. Staunton and Morphy met socially in Birmingham and, after a tense discussion, Staunton agreed to play in early November. Just after the tournament a letter signed by [...] "Anti-book" [...] appeared in Staunton's column in The Illustrated London News, alleging that Morphy did not actually have the money for his share of the stakes. This letter is widely thought to have been written by Staunton himself; if so, he must have written it immediately after reading Walker's article and Morphy's letter and immediately before leaving for Birmingham. Around this time Morphy wrote to friends in the US asking them to obtain the stake money for the Staunton match. Morphy's family refused to contribute as they [...] "should not allow him to play a money match either with his own money or anyone else's", but the New Orleans Chess Club sent £500. Meanwhile, Morphy went to Paris to play against continental masters. In September The Illustrated London News printed both a complimentary full-page article about Morphy and a complimentary mention of him in its chess column. On 6 October 1858, while in Paris Morphy wrote Staunton an open letter which was also circulated to several publications, in which Morphy complained about Staunton's conduct. Staunton replied on 9 October, re-stating the difficulties he faced, but now giving them as reasons to cancel the match. On 23 October, Staunton published his entire reply along with a partial copy of Morphy's open letter, omitting the reference to the [...] "Anti-book" [...] letter. Various chess columns then printed anonymous and acrimonious letters. Morphy took no part in any of this, but wrote to Lord Lyttelton, the president of the British Chess Association, explaining his own efforts to bring about the match, accusing Staunton of avoiding the match by all means short of admitting he did not wish to play, complaining about Staunton's representation of the facts in The Illustrated London News, and demanding [...] "that you shall declare to the world it is through no fault of mine that this match has not taken place." [...] Lyttelton replied that it was reasonable for Staunton to decline the match, but that in his opinion Staunton should have done so plainly in his first letter to America, but had instead often given the impression that he would soon be ready to start the match.|$|E
