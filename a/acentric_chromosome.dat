50|$|<b>Acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> {{fragments}} {{may arise}} {{in a variety}} of ways. One way is that disrepair of DNA double-strand breaks can lead to symmetrical or asymmetrical chromatid and chromosome exchanges as well as chromatid and chromosome fragments. If DNA damage exceeds the repair capacity of the cell, unrepaired double-stranded DNA breaks may also result in <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> fragments. Another way eccentric chromosome fragments may arise is when defects in genes related to homologous recombinational repair (ex: ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51) result in a dysfunctional error-free homologous recombinational DNA repair pathway and causes the cell to resort to the error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathway, increasing the likelihood of incorrect repair of DNA breaks, formation of dicentric chromosomes, and <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> fragments. If enzymes in the NHEJ repair pathway are defective as well, DNA breaks may not be repaired at all. Additionally, simultaneous excision repair of damaged or inappropriate bases incorporated in DNA that are in proximity and on opposite complementary DNA strands may lead to DNA double-stranded breaks and micronucleus formation, especially if the gap-filling step of the repair pathway is not completed.|$|E
50|$|For Class I, the {{proposed}} mechanism is that chromatid breakage occurs during mitosis, {{resulting in a}} chromosome fragment. That <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> fragment may segregate with the intact chromatid and result in partial tetrasomy; or, it may segregate with the complementary broken chromatid and result in partial trisomy because the broken chromatid may be saved by telomere restitution. In both cases, the inverted duplicated marker forms only after cell division and replication by rejoining the broken, replicated ends of the fragment. It is also suggested that U-type exchange during meiosis I may lead to partial tetrasomy.|$|E
50|$|Micronuclei {{primarily}} {{result from}} <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> fragments or lagging whole chromosomes {{that are not}} included in the daughter nuclei produced by mitosis because they fail to correctly attach to the spindle during the segregation of chromosomes in anaphase. These full chromosomes or chromatid fragments are eventually enclosed by a nuclear membranes and are structurally similar to conventional nuclei, albeit smaller in size. This small nucleus is referred to as a micronucleus. The formation of micronuclei can only be observed in cells undergoing nuclear division and can be clearly seen using cytochalasin B to block cytokinesis to produce a binucleated cells.|$|E
5000|$|To {{suppress}} crossing over, balancer chromosomes are {{the products}} of multiple, nested chromosomal inversions so that synapsis between homologous chromosomes is disrupted. This construct is called a crossover suppressor. [...] If crossing over between a balancer chromosome and the balancer's homolog does occur during meiosis each chromatid ends up lacking some genes and carrying two copies of other genes. Recombination in inverted regions leads to dicentric or <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (chromosomes with two centromeres or no centromere). Progeny carrying chromosomes that are {{the products of}} recombination between balancer and normal chromosomes are not viable (they die).|$|R
40|$|Because of {{multiple}} abnormalities in her children, {{a young mother}} was investigated and shown to have a 47,XXX chromosome constitution. Additional C group chromosomes without visible centromeric constrictions were found {{in a number of}} cells from the peripheral blood, and using C and Q banding techniques these chromosomes were identified as X chromosomes. Analysis of the banding karyotypes of 300 cells revealed that the <b>acentric</b> X <b>chromosomes</b> had the ability to replicate and that this replication was associated with non-disjunction leading to aneuploid cells. Even though cultured skin cells did not have <b>acentric</b> or extra <b>chromosomes</b> in addition to the triple-X, examination of buccal mucosa cells for the presence of X-bodies suggested that the phenomenon of non-disjunction was present in the epithelial cells of the patient. In addition to the X without a visible centromeric constriction, either acentric D or E chromosomes were found. The data suggest that a functional defect in the cells per se is responsible for the appearance of the <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosomes...</b>|$|R
40|$|PurposeTo combine {{telomere}} and centromere (TC) staining {{of premature}} chromosome condensation (PCC) fusions to identify dicentrics, centric rings, and <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> making possible {{the realization of}} a dose–response curve and automation of the process. Methods and MaterialsBlood samples from healthy donors were exposed to 60 Co irradiation at varying doses up to 8 Gy, followed by a repair period of 8 hours. Premature chromosome condensation fusions were carried out, and TC staining using peptide nucleic acid probes was performed. Chromosomal aberration (CA) scoring was carried out manually and automatically using PCC-TCScore software, developed in our laboratory. ResultsWe successfully optimized the hybridization conditions and image capture parameters, to increase the sensitivity and effectiveness of CA scoring. Dicentrics, centric rings, and <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosomes</b> were rapidly and accurately detected, leading to a linear-quadratic dose–response curve by manual scoring at up to 8 Gy. Using PCC-TCScore software for automatic scoring, {{we were able to}} detect 95 % of dicentrics and centric rings. ConclusionThe introduction of TC staining to the PCC fusion technique has made possible the rapid scoring of unstable CAs, including dicentrics, with a level of accuracy and ease not previously possible. This new approach can be used for biological dosimetry in radiation emergency medicine, where the rapid and accurate detection of dicentrics is a high priority using automated scoring. Because there is no culture time, this new approach can also be used for the follow-up of patients treated by genotoxic therapy, creating the possibility to perform the estimation of induced chromosomal aberrations immediately after the blood draw...|$|R
50|$|Micronucleus is {{the name}} given to the small nucleus that forms {{whenever}} a chromosome or a fragment of a chromosome is not incorporated {{into one of the}} daughter nuclei during cell division. It usually is a sign of genotoxic events and chromosomal instability. Micronuclei are commonly seen in cancerous cells and may indicate genomic damage events that can increase the risk of developmental or degenerative diseases. Micronuclei form during anaphase from lagging <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> or chromatid fragments caused by incorrectly repaired or unrepaired DNA breaks or by nondisjunction of chromosomes. This incorrect segregation of chromosomes may result from hypomethylation of repeat sequences present in pericentromeric DNA, irregularities in kinetochore proteins or their assembly, dysfunctional spindle apparatus, or flawed anaphase checkpoint genes. Many micronucleus assays have been developed to test for the presence of these structures and determine their frequency in cells exposed to certain chemicals or subjected to stressful conditions.|$|E
5000|$|A {{more common}} {{mechanism}} {{in the formation}} of isochromosomes is through the breakage and fusion of sister chromatids, most likely occurring in early anaphase of mitosis or meiosis. A double-stranded break in the pericentric region of the chromosome is repaired when the sister chromatids, each containing a centromere, are fused together. [...] This U-type exchange of genetic material creates an isodicentric chromosome. Misdivision of the centromere and U-type exchange can occur in sister chromatids, thus creating an isochromosome with genetically identical arms. However, U-type exchange can also occur for homologous chromosomes which creates an isochromosome with homologous arms. This exchange between homologues is most likely due to homologous sequences containing low copy repeats. Regardless of the chromosome involved in U-type exchange, the acentric fragment of the chromosome is lost, thus creating a partial monosomy of genes located in that portion of the <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{micronucleus}} is the erratic (third) nucleus that {{is formed}} during the anaphase of mitosis or meiosis. Micronuclei (the name means 'small nucleus') are cytoplasmic bodies having {{a portion of}} <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> or whole chromosome which was not carried to the opposite poles during the anaphase. Their formation results in the daughter cell lacking a part or all of a chromosome. These chromosome fragments or whole chromosomes normally develop nuclear membranes and form as micronuclei as a third nucleus. After cytokinesis, one daughter cell ends up with one nucleus and the other ends up with one large and one small nucleus, i.e., micronuclei. There is a chance {{of more than one}} micronucleus forming when more genetic damage has happened.The micronucleus test is used as a tool for genotoxicity assessment of various chemicals. It is easier to conduct than the chromosomal aberration test in terms of procedures and evaluation. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes targeted to the centromere region, it can be determined if a whole chromosome, or only a fragment is lost.|$|E
40|$|Genome rearrangements {{are often}} {{associated}} with genome instability observed in cancer and other pathological disorders. Different types of repeat elements are common in genomes and are prone to instability. S-phase checkpoints, recombination, and telomere maintenance pathways have been implicated in suppressing chromosome rearrangements, but {{little is known about}} the molecular mechanisms and the chromosome intermediates generating such genome-wide instability. In the December 15, 2009, issue of Genes & Development, two studies by Paek and colleagues (2861 – 2875) and Mizuno and colleagues (pp. 2876 – 2886), demonstrate that nearby inverted repeats in budding and fission yeasts recombine spontaneously and frequently to form dicentric and <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> The recombination mechanism underlying this phenomenon does not appear to require double-strand break formation, and is likely caused by a replication mechanism involving template switching...|$|R
40|$|Neuroblastoma, {{the most}} common extracranial tumor of childhood, arises from the {{developing}} neurons of the sympathetic nervous system (neural cress stem cells) and has various biological and clinical characteristics. The mean age at disease onset is 18 months. Neuroblastoma {{has a number of}} unique characteristics: a capacity for spontaneous regression in babies younger than 12 months even in the presence of distant metastases, for differentiation (maturation into ganglioneuroma) in infants after the first year of life, and for swift aggressive development and rapid metastasis. There are 2 clinical classifications of neuroblastoma: the International neuroblastoma staging system that is based on surgical results and the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System. One of the fundamentally important problems for the clinical picture of neuroblastoma is difficulties making its prognosis. Along with clinical parameters (a patient’s age, tumor extent and site), some histological, molecular biochemical (ploidy) and genetic (chromosomal aberrations, MYCN gene status, deletion of the locus 1 p 36 and 11 q, the longer arm of chromosome 17, etc.) characteristics of tumor cells are of considerable promise. MYCN gene amplification is observed in 20 – 30 % of primary neuroblastomas and {{it is one of the}} major indicators of disease aggressiveness, early chemotherapy resistance, and a poor prognosis. There are 2 types of MYCN gene amplification: extrachromosomal (double <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosomes)</b> and intrachromosomal (homogenically painted regions). Examination of double <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosomes</b> revealed an interesting fact that it may be eliminated (removed) from the nucleus through the formation of micronuclei. MYCN oncogene amplification is accompanied frequently by 1 p 36 locus deletion and longer 17 q arm and less frequently by 11 q 23 deletion; these are poor prognostic factors for the disease. The paper considers in detail the specific, unique characteristics of the biological behavior of neuroblastoma, which are untypical of other tumors; histological structure; determinants of the prognosis of the disease, including MYCN gene status; and mechanisms for formation of the amplification and elimination of amplified sequences from the nucleus...|$|R
40|$|A {{centromere}} {{is considered}} to be an essential chromosomal component where microtubule-kinetochore interaction occurs to segregate sister chromatids faithfully and <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are unstable and lost through cell divisions. We report a novel marker <b>chromosome</b> that was <b>acentric</b> but stable through cell divisions. The patient was a 2 -year-old girl with mental retardation, patent ductus arteriosus, and mild dysmorphic features. G-banded chromosome analysis revealed that an additional small marker chromosome was observed in all 100 cells examined. By the reverse-chromosome-painting method, the marker was found to originate from the distal region of 8 p, and a subsequent two-color FISH analysis with cosmid probes around the region revealed that the marker was an inverted duplication interpreted as 8 pter [...] >p 23. 1 ::p 23. 1 [...] > 8 pter. No centromeric region was involved in the marker. By FISH, no alpha-satellite sequence was detected on the marker, while a telomere sequence was detected at each end. Anti-kinetochore immunostaining, using a serum from a patient with CREST (calcinosis, Raynaud syndrome, esophageal dismotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) syndrome, showed a pair of signals on the marker, which indicated that a functional kinetochore was present on the marker. The analysis of this patient might suggest the possibility that an ancient centromere sequence exists at distal 8 p (8 p 23. 1 -pter) and was activated through the chromosome rearrangement in the patient...|$|R
50|$|Micronuclei {{formation}} {{may also}} result from chromosome malsegregation during anaphase. Hypomethylation of cytosine in centromeric and pericentromeric areas and higher-order repeats of satellite DNA in centromeric DNA {{can result in}} such chromosomal loss events. Classical satellite DNA is normally heavily methylated at cytosine residues but may become almost fully unmethylated due to ICF syndrome (Immunodeficiency, centromere instability, and facial anomalies syndrome) or after treatment by DNA methyl transferase inhibitors. Since assembly of kinetochore proteins at centromeres {{is affected by the}} methylation of cytosine and histone proteins, a reduction in heterochromatin integrity as a result of hypomethylation can interfere with microtubule attachment to chromosomes and with the sensing of tension from correct microtubule-kinetochore connections. Other possible causes of chromosome loss that could lead to micronuclei formation are defects in kinetochore and microtubule interactions, defects in mitotic spindle assembly, mitosis check point defects, abnormal centrosome amplification, and telomeric end fusions that result in dicentric chromosomes that detach from the spindle during anaphase. Micronuclei originating from chromosome loss events and <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> fragments can be distinguished using pancentromeric DNA probes.|$|E
40|$|The 15 q 11 -q 13 {{region is}} {{characterized}} by high instability, caused {{by the presence of}} several paralogous segmental duplications. Although most mechanisms dealing with cryptic deletions and amplifications have been at least partly characterized, {{little is known about the}} rare translocations involving this region. We characterized at the molecular level five unbalanced translocations, including a jumping one, having most of 15 q transposed to the end of another chromosome, whereas the der(15) (pter-. q 11 -q 13) was missing. Imbalances were associated either with Prader-Willi or Angelman syndrome. Array-CGH demonstrated the absence of any copy number changes in the recipient chromosome in three cases, while one carried a cryptic terminal deletion and another a large terminal deletion, already diagnosed by classical cytogenetics. We cloned the breakpoint junctions in two cases, whereas cloning was impaired by complex regional genomic architecture and mosaicism in the others. Our results strongly indicate that some of our translocations originated through a prezygotic/postzygotic two-hit mechanism starting with the formation of an acentric 15 qter-. q 1 ::q 1 -. qter representing the reciprocal product of the inv dup(15) supernumerary marker chromosome. An embryo with such an <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> plus a normal chromosome 15 inherited from the other parent could survive only if partial trisomy 15 rescue would occur through elimination of part of the <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome,</b> stabilization of the remaining portion with telomere capture, and formation of a derivative chromosome. All these events likely do not happen concurrently in a single cell but are rather the result of successive stabilization attempts occurring in different cells of which only the fittest will finally survive. Accordingly, jumping translocations might represent successful rescue attempts in different cells rather than transfer of the same 15 q portion to different chromosomes. We also hypothesize that neocentromerization of the original <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> during early embryogenesis may be required to avoid its loss before cell survival is finally assured...|$|E
40|$|Chromosomal rearrangements {{occur in}} all organisms and are {{important}} {{both in the}} evolution of species and in pathology. In this dissertation I show that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or budding yeast, one type of chromosomal rearrangement occurs when inverted repeats fuse, likely during DNA replication by a novel mechanism termed "faulty template switching". This fusion can lead to the formation of either a dicentric or <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome,</b> depending on the direction of the replication fork. Dicentric chromosomes are inherently unstable due to their abnormal number of centromeres, and thus undergo additional chromosomal rearrangements and chromosome loss...|$|E
40|$|Gross {{chromosomal}} rearrangements (GCRs) {{are large}} scale changes to chromosome structure {{and can lead}} to human disease. We previously showed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that nearby inverted repeat sequences (∼ 20 – 200 bp of homology, separated by ∼ 1 – 5 kb) frequently fuse to form unstable dicentric and <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> Here we analyzed inverted repeat fusion in mutants of three sets of genes. First, we show that genes in the error-free postreplication repair (PRR) pathway prevent fusion of inverted repeats, while genes in the translesion branch have no detectable role. Second, we found that siz 1 mutants, which are defective for Srs 2 recruitment to replication forks, and srs 2 mutants had opposite effects on instability. This may reflect separate roles for Srs 2 in different phases of the cell cycle. Third, we provide evidence for a faulty template switch model by studying mutants of DNA polymerases; defects in DNA pol delta (lagging strand polymerase) and Mgs 1 (a pol delta interacting protein) lead to a defect in fusion events as well as allelic recombination. Pol delta and Mgs 1 may collaborate either in strand annealing and/or DNA replication involved in fusion and allelic recombination events. Fourth, by studying genes implicated in suppression of GCRs in other studies, we found that inverted repeat fusion has a profile of genetic regulation distinct from these other major forms of GCR formation...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that {{mammalian}} cells that carry unstably amplified genes for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gradually lose the amplified DHFR genes when grown {{in the absence of}} the DHFR inhibitor methotrexate (MTX). Unstably amplified genes occur on small <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosomes</b> called double minutes (DMs) or even smaller chromatin fragments, in contrast to stably amplified genes, which reside in centromere-containing chromosomes. We have found that the rate of loss of the unstably amplified DHFR genes can be greatly increased by growing the cells in the presence of a nonlethal concentration of hydroxyurea. For example, in one MTX-resistant subline studied, approximate to 90 % of the original DHFR gene dosage is lost in 25 - 30 cell doublings in the absence of MTX. The same degree of loss is achieved, however, in < 4 doublings if cells are grown in the presence of 50 μM hydroxyurea. This new effect of hydroxyurea does not appear to be due to changes in plating efficiency or selective cytotoxicity. In particular, no increase in cell death occurs at 50 μM hydroxyurea, and cells continue to multiply, albeit 1 / 2 to 2 / 3 as fast as in the absence of hydroxyurea. The ability to selectively accelerate the loss of amplified genes from mammalian cells as shown in the present work may have important implications both for the problem of drug resistance in cancer chemotherapy and for curing mammalian cells of extrachromosomally maintained DNA genomes of pathogenic viruses...|$|R
40|$|We have {{performed}} experiments using the WIL 2 -NS human B lymphoblastoid cell line and primary human lymphocytes to: (i) determine {{the importance of}} including measurements of nucleoplasmic bridges (NPB) in the cyto-kinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay; (ii) provide evidence that NPB originate from dicentric chromosomes and centric ring chromosomes. In addition, we describe theoretical models that explain how dicentric chromosomes and centric ring chromosomes may result {{in the formation of}} NPB at anaphase. The results with WIL 2 -NS showed {{that it was possible to}} distinguish genotoxic effects induced by different oxidizing agents in terms of the NPB/micro-nucleus frequency ratio. The results with lymphocytes indicated a strong correlation: (i) between NPB, centric ring chromosomes and dicentric chromosomes in metaphases (r> 0. 93, P 0. 93, P < 0. 0001). The dose–response curves with γ-rays were very similar for NPB, ring chromosomes and dicentric chromosomes, as were the dose–response curves for MNi, acentric rings and fragments. However, not all <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosomes</b> and dicentric chromosomes/ centric rings were converted to MNi and NPB respectively, depending on the dose of radiation. Preliminary data, using FISH, suggest that NPB often represent DNA from a structural rearrangement involving only one or two homo-logous chromosomes. The results from this study validate the inclusion of NPB in the CBMN assay which provides a valuable measure of chromosome breakage/rearrangement that was otherwise not available in the micronucleus assay. The CBMN assay allows NPB measurement to be achieved reliably because inhibition of cytokinesis prevents the loss of NPB that would otherwise occur if cells were allowed to divide...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanisms}} that safeguard cells against chromosomal instability (CIN) are of great interest, as CIN contributes to tumorigenesis. To {{gain insight into}} these mechanisms, we studied the behavior of cells entering mitosis with damaged chromosomes. We used the endonuclease I-CreI to generate acentric chromosomes in Drosophila larvae. While I-CreI expression produces acentric chromosomes {{in the majority of}} neuronal stem cells, remarkably, it has no effect on adult survival. Our live studies reveal that acentric chromatids segregate efficiently to opposite poles. The acentric chromatid poleward movement is mediated through DNA tethers decorated with BubR 1, Polo, INCENP, and Aurora-B. Reduced BubR 1 or Polo function results in abnormal segregation of acentric chromatids, a decrease in <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> tethering, and a great reduction in adult survival. We propose that BubR 1 and Polo facilitate the accurate segregation of acentric chromatids by maintaining the integrity of the tethers that connect acentric chromosomes to their centric partners...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe cytokinesis-blocked {{micronucleus}} (CBMN) assay, {{in combination}} with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) of human pan-centromeric DNA probes, or with CREST antibodies that specifically stain kinetochore proteins, is widely used on several cell types. It distinguishes micronuclei containing one or several whole chromosomes, which are positively labeled (centromere positive micronucleus, C+MN, due to aneugenic effect), or <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> fragments, which are unlabeled due {{to the absence of}} centromere (centromere negative micronucleus. C-MN, due to clastogenic effect). However, the very slight level of the centromeric signals obtained with the FISH technique on primary human fibroblasts, a cell type commonly used in environmental genetic toxicology, leads to great difficulties in distinguishing C+MN and C-MN. Furthermore, the CREST technique may lead to inappropriate results particularly with regards to variations in antibody composition between patient sera. Our results show that the in vitro CBMN, {{in combination with}} immunofluorescence staining of CENP-A (centromere protein A), efficiently screens genotoxicants for their ability to induce clastogenic and/or aneugenic effects. We propose the in vitro CBMN assay in combination with immunofluorescence staining of CENP-A as a suitable tool in environmental genotoxicity testing of primary human fibroblasts.

40|$|Checkpoint {{mechanisms}} that respond to DNA {{damage in the}} mitotic cell cycle are necessary to maintain the fidelity of chromosome transmission. These mechanisms {{must be able to}} distinguish the normal telomeres of linear chromosomes from double-strand break damage. However, on several occasions, Drosophila chromosomes that lack their normal telomeric DNA have been recovered, raising the issue of whether Drosophila is able to distinguish telomeric termini from nontelomeric breaks. We used site-specific recombination on a dispensable chromosome to induce the formation of a dicentric <b>chromosome</b> and an <b>acentric,</b> telomere-bearing, <b>chromosome</b> fragment in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster. The acentric fragment is lost when cells divide and the dicentric breaks, transmitting a chromosome that has lost a telomere to each daughter cell. In the eye imaginal disc, cells with a newly broken chromosome initially experience mitotic arrest and then undergo apoptosis when cells are induced to divide as the eye differentiates. Therefore, Drosophila cells can detect and respond to a single broken chromosome. It follows that transmissible chromosomes lacking normal telomeric DNA nonetheless must possess functional telomeres. We conclude that Drosophila telomeres can be established and maintained by a mechanism that does not rely on the terminal DNA sequence...|$|R
40|$|SummaryChromosomal {{instability}} (CIN) is {{a common}} feature of most human neoplasms and was defined, in a seminal study by Vogelstein and colleagues [1], as persistently elevated rates of whole chromosome mis-segregation. Since then, it was shown that certain errors in mitosis, including defects in the spindle assembly checkpoint [2], sister chromatid cohesion [3], kinetochore-microtubule (kMT) attachments [4, 5], and centrosome number [6] can cause chromosome mis-segregation {{in the form of}} merotelically attached anaphase lagging chromosomes — chromosomes that lag behind at the spindle equator while all the other chromosomes move toward the spindle poles [7] (Figure 1 A). A recent study has suggested that pre-mitotic replication stress generates partially replicated chromosomes during mitosis, and that this results in both numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities through the formation of chromosome bridges and <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> fragments during anaphase [8]. To determine whether whole chromosome instability in cancer cells is caused by defects originating in mitosis (lagging chromosomes) or from ones originating pre-mitotically (chromatin bridges and acentric fragments), we compared a variety of CIN+ to CIN- cells to determine the types of segregation defects that phenotypically distinguish CIN+ from CIN- cells and whose abrogation can rescue whole chromosomal instability...|$|E
40|$|To whom {{correspondence}} {{should be}} addressed Using human lymphocytes and the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay we have recently shown that excision-repairable DNA lesions induced by methylnhrosourea (MNU) and ultraviolet (UV) light (254 nm) {{can be converted to}} micronuclei (MNi) within one cell cycle if cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C) is added during the G, phase of the cell cycle after mitogen stimulation. We have proposed that this conversion resulted from the inhibition by ARA-C of the gap-filling step during excision repair which results in the formation of single-stranded breaks at repair sites; these breaks are then converted to chromatid or chromosome breaks and subsequently to MNi on completion of nuclear division. To confirm this hypothesis we have examined the origin of MNi induced by ARA-C by using anti-kinetochore antibodies and found that between 77 and 86 % of these MNi are kinetochore-negative which supports the idea that they originate mainly from <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> fragments. We have also demonstrated that combining ARA-C treatment with hydroxyurea (HU) during G! provides a synergistic improvement in the conversion of spontaneous (4 -fold increment) or MNU-induced (2 -fold increment) excision-repairable DNA lesions to MNi when compared to the effects with ARA-C alone.

We {{have used this}} methodology in several human cell strains to reduce expression of the Prkdc (DNA-PKcs) gene coding for the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) that {{is involved in the}} nonhomologous end joining of DNA double-strand breaks.

Cytogenetic GTL banding analysis and the absence of detectable fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) signals using telomeric probes indicate the marker to be a ring chromosome. The chromosome is negative for CBG banding and is devoid of detectable centromeric α satellite and its associated centromere protein CENP-B, suggesting activation of a neocentromere within the 1 p 32 - 36. 1 region.

40|$|Abstract: A "micronucleus " {{is a small}} nucleus. The nucleus is the {{organelle}} in {{the cell}} that contains the genetic material (DNA) that directs normal cellular function and cellular reproduction. In cells of eukaryotic organisms, the nucleus contains DNA packaged into chromosomes. In vivo mutagencity and carcinogenicity studies are posing a high demand for test related resources. The in vitro micronucleus assay is a mutagenic test system {{for the detection of}} chemicals which induce the formation of small membrane bound DNA fragments i. e. micronuclei in the cytoplasm of interphase cells. These micronuclei may originate from <b>acentric</b> fragments (<b>chromosome</b> fragments lacking a centromere) or whole chromosomes which are unable to migrate {{with the rest of the}} chromosomes during the anaphase of cell division. The micronucleus assay is an important component of genetic toxicology screening programs. There is substantial evidence that chromosome mutations and related events in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes of somatic cells are involved in induction and/or progression of some cancers in humans and experimental animals. The study of DNA damage at the chromosome level is an essential part of genetic toxicology because chromosomal mutation is an important event in carcinogenesis. The micronucleus assays have emerged as one of the preferred methods for assessing chromosome damage because they enable both chromosome loss and chromosome breakage to be measured reliably...|$|R
40|$|Replication fork {{inactivation}} can {{be overcome}} by homologous recombination, but this can cause gross chromosomal rearrangements that subsequently missegregate at mitosis, driving further chromosome instability. It is unclear when the chromosome rearrangements are generated and whether individual replication problems or the resulting recombination intermediates delay the cell cycle. Here we have investigated checkpoint activation during HR-dependent replication restart using a site-specific replication fork-arrest system. Analysis during a single cell cycle shows that HR-dependent replication intermediates arise in S phase, shortly after replication arrest, and are resolved into <b>acentric</b> and dicentric <b>chromosomes</b> in G 2. Despite this, cells progress into mitosis without delay. Neither the DNA damage nor the intra-S phase checkpoints are activated in the first cell cycle, demonstrating that these checkpoints are blind to replication and recombination intermediates {{as well as to}} rearranged chromosomes. The dicentrics form anaphase bridges that subsequently break, inducing checkpoint activation in the second cell cycle...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} DNA {{substitution}} by the thymidine analogue 5 -bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) on cell cycle progression and mkronucleus induction were studied in different mammalian cell cultures. Simultaneous flow cytometric measurements of DNA content and side scatter of nuclei in Chinese hamster embryo (CHE) cells revealed a concentration-dependent temporary {{block in the}} G 2 /M phase of the first cell cycle. NTH 3 T 3 cells and human amniotic fluid fibroblast-like cells, on the contrary, did not show any cell cycle disturbances {{in the presence of}} BrdU. Micronucleus frequency increased as soon as CHE cells started to divide and reached a plateau when all cells have divided. The height of this plateau was almost equal for 60 and 100 /tM BrdU. This saturation of micronucleus induction was due to a saturation of BrdU incorporation into DNA already at a dosis of 60 /tM as shown by the BrdU/Hoechst quenching technique. Indirect immuno-fluorescent staining of kinetochores with CREST antibodies revealed that nearly all BrdU-induced micronuclei were kinetochore-negative suggesting the presence of <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> fragments in these micronuclei. DNA distri-butions of micronuclei measured by flow cytometry showed several peaks representing micronuclei which contain DNA fragments of defined sizes induced by non-random breakage of chromosomes 1 and X as verified by flow karyotyping and C-banding...|$|E
40|$|Aberrant {{chromosome}} structures {{can promote}} tumors {{in the early}} stages of carcinogenesis and lead to tumor cells becoming resistant to chemotherapy, for example by changing in drug metabolism. Dicentric (containing two centromeres) and acentric (containing no centromeres) chromosomes are two abnormal chromosome structures that consider as precursors of a variety of gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) generated by subsequent recombination events [1 - 7]. However, the mechanism of the dicentric and acentric palindromic chromosome formation and their subsequent metabolism is difficult to directly visualise. The previous results from our lab shows that replication forks stalled at a specific replication termination sequence (RTS 1) can result in the formation of the dicentric and acentric palindromic chromosomes in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe [48 - 52]. However, the formation of acentric and dicentric chromosomes results in a significant visability loss, due to instability and miss-segregation of the chromosomes in the yeast cells. Thus, their fate is difficult or impossible to follow. To resolve this problem, a non-essential mini-chromosome (Ch 16) was developed as a novel model system in this project. The behaviour of rearranged chromosome in vivo and their subsequent fate have been visualised by integrating the lac operator (lacO) and tetracycline operator (tetO) arrays with auxotropic makers, adjacent to the RTSI locus on Ch 16. The results reveal imbalanced segregation of a dicentric chromosome and subsequently undergoes a breakage event. An <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> appears to be decoupled or lost rapidly from the nucleus...|$|E
40|$|Centromeres are {{critically}} important for chromosome stability and integrity. Most eukaryotes have regional centromeres that include long tracts of repetitive DNA packaged into pericentric heterochromatin. Neocentromeres, new sites of functional kinetochore assembly, can form at ectopic loci because no DNA sequence is strictly required for assembly of a functional kinetochore. In humans, neocentromeres often arise in cells with gross chromosome rearrangements that rescue an <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome.</b> Here, we studied {{the properties of}} centromeres in Candida albicans, the most prevalent fungal pathogen of humans, which has small regional centromeres that lack pericentric heterochromatin. We functionally delimited centromere DNA on Chromosome 5 (CEN 5) and then replaced the entire region with the counter-selectable URA 3 gene or other marker genes. All of the resulting cen 5 D::URA 3 transformants stably retained both copies of Chr 5, indicating that a functional neocentromere had assembled efficiently on the homolog lacking CEN 5 DNA. Strains selected to maintain only the cen 5 D::URA 3 homolog and no wild-type Chr 5 homolog also grew well, indicating that neocentromere function is independent {{of the presence of}} any wild-type CEN 5 DNA. Two classes of neocentromere (neoCEN) strains were distinguishable: ‘‘proximal neoCEN’ ’ and ‘‘distal neoCEN’ ’ strains. Neocentromeres in the distal neoCEN strains formed at loci about 200 – 450 kb from cen 5 D::URA 3 on either chromosome arm, as detected by massively parallel sequencing of DNA isolated by CENP-ACse 4 p chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). In the proximal neoCEN strains, the neocentromeres forme...|$|E
5000|$|Lepidoptera also do {{not show}} the {{classical}} breakage-fusion-bridge cycle that is a characteristic of dominant lethals induced in Diptera. It appears that lepidopteran chromosomes can tolerate telomere loss without the drastic effects that this has on chromosomes in other orders. [...] Lepidopteran chromosomes possess a localized kinetochore plate to which the spindle microtubules attach during cell division. [...] The kinetochore plates are large and cover {{a significant portion of}} the chromosome length, ensuring that more radiation-induced breaks will not lead to the loss of chromosome fragments as is typical in species with monocentric chromosomes. In species with large kinetochore plates, the fragments may persist for a number of mitotic cell divisions, and can even be transmitted through germ cells to the next generation. [...] The plates also reduce the risk of lethality caused by the formation of dicentric <b>chromosomes,</b> <b>acentric</b> fragments, and other unstable aberrations.|$|R
40|$|Radiations and {{chemical}} carcinogens induce the amplification of viral DNA inserts {{and of their}} cellular flanking sequences in SV 40 -transformed Chinese hamster embyro cells. In the cell line CO 60, the phenomenon is easily measured by in situ hybridization using SV 40 -DNA as a probe. We found that the appearance of microchromosomes (MC) in CO 60 metaphases correlated well with the induction of SV 40 -DNA amplification (SDA) mediated in the same cells by chemical carcinogens. SDA and MC formation had the same inducers and were essentially transient phenomena whose occurrence and disappearance were simultaneous. The banding properties of MC and the respective time courses of induction of chromosome aberrations and MC formation/disappearance indicated that MC were not chromosome or chromatid breaks but rather <b>acentric</b> double minute-like <b>chromosomes.</b> Double minute chromosomes (DM) {{have been shown to}} contain amplified genes. They specifically occur in established cell lines and in vivo tumor cells. Therefore, the reported correlations between SDA and MC formation and the homologies between MC and DM in CO 60 cells further support the existence of specific relationships between mutagenesis, gene amplification, in vivo selective pressures and tumor cytogenetics. © 1986 IRL Press Ltd.

40|$|The study {{included}} 75 subjects exposed to low doses of external ionizing radiation and 25 subjects {{from the control}} group, all male. The first group (A) consisted of 25 subjects employed {{in the production of}} technetium, with an average job experience of 15 years. The second group (B) consisted of 25 subjects exposed to ionizing radiation from enclosed sources, working in jobs involving the control of X-ray devices and americium smoke detectors, their average work experience being 18. 5 years. The third group (C) consisted of 25 subjects involved in the decontamination of the terrain at Borovac from radioactive rounds with depleted uranium left over after the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999, their average job experience being 18. 5 years. The control group (K) consisted of 25 subjects who have not been in contact with sources of ionizing radiation and who hold administrative positions. Frequencies of chromosome aberrations were determined in lymphocytes of peripheral blood and compared to the control group. The average annual absorbed dose determined by thermoluminescent dosimeters for all three groups did not exceed 2 mSv. In the present study, the largest number of observed changes are <b>acentric</b> fragments and <b>chromosome</b> breaks. The highest occupational risk appears to involve subjects working in manufacturing of the radio-isotope technetium...|$|R
