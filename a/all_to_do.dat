5|$|Some {{critics have}} noted {{similarities}} between names in Septimus Heap {{and those in}} Harry Potter, such as Petroc Trelawney (Jenna's pet rock) and Sybill Trelawney (a professor in Harry Potter); also both series feature Boggarts (which are intelligent Marsh creatures in Septimus Heap and shape-shifters in Harry Potter). In response, British author Phil Knight has commented: The Petroc Trelawney in the Septimus Heap books is nothing at <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Professor Trelawney. He is a Radio 3 presenter who may well be known to Angie Sage personally, but otherwise will be known over the air. Think: why would Jenna call a pet rock 'Trelawney'? To a Radio 3 listener like me, it's perfectly logical... And as for Boggarts, they've been around here in the North of England for a long time. Manchester has Boggart Hole Clough, for example. They're not really like either Sage's or Rowling's creatures, but pre-exist either of them.|$|E

500|$|Further delays on the Creek Turnpike project {{appeared}} {{inevitable in}} October 1990, {{as a new}} area meeting the federal definition of a wetland was discovered {{in the path of}} the turnpike. OTA officials did not bring the area to USACE's attention because they did not believe it met the criteria to be considered a wetland. Frustration mounted after the find; rumors surfaced that OTA was considering canceling the Creek Turnpike and shifting the remaining funds to turnpike projects in the Oklahoma City area. In an interview after an OTA meeting, chairman John Kilpatrick was quoted as saying [...] "God only knows when [...] be completed," [...] describing the project as a [...] "total disaster" [...] and commenting [...] "If we had it <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> over again, we wouldn't do that project." [...] OTA was concerned about the financial impact of USACE's delay in issuing the required permits; each day after the planned opening date that the project ran late added $20,000 (approximately $ in [...] dollars) to the total cost of the project. USACE finally issued the permit on November 15, over a year after OTA applied for it.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal beat Charlton Athletic {{in early}} October {{to extend their}} unbeaten run to 48 league matches. Charlton manager Alan Curbishley said of his opponents: [...] "The gulf between Arsenal {{and the rest of}} the Premier League means that the rest have got it <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to try and stop them, and I'm {{including}} the big three or four." [...] Two goals from Pirès and one from Henry ensured a 3–1 win against Aston Villa, who had led the game early on. Attention soon turned to Arsenal's trip to face Manchester United. The champions were looking to go half a century of league games unbeaten, whereas the home team – in transition, attempted to push on for a title challenge. In the match, a challenge by Sol Campbell on Wayne Rooney earned Manchester United a penalty, converted by Ruud van Nistelrooy in the 73rd minute. Rooney then scored United's second goal of the match to end Arsenal's unbeaten run on 49 games. Tempers boiled over in the players' tunnel, where pizza was thrown at Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson. When speaking to the media, a distraught Wenger told reporters that Rooney dived to win the penalty and criticised the refereeing performance of Mike Riley. He was later found guilty of insinuating that Van Nistelrooy was a cheat, and fined £15,000 by the FA.|$|E
500|$|Mwng was {{eventually}} released on 15 May 2000 in the United Kingdom on CD, cassette, and vinyl, and reached number 11 in the UK Albums Chart. In the United States, Mwng {{was released on}} 20 June 2000 by Flydaddy, with a bonus CD entitled Mwng Bach ( [...] ; English: Little Mane) featuring five Welsh language tracks: [...] "Sali Mali", from the 1995 EP Moog Droog, and four songs which had originally been released in the UK as B-sides. [...] This two-disc version of Mwng was reissued in the US in 2005 by XL Recordings/Beggars Banquet US. [...] "Ysbeidiau Heulog" [...] was released as the only single from the album, and failed to chart inside the UK Singles Top 75. Although the Super Furry Animals had [...] "no commercial expectations" [...] for the album, Mwng became the first Welsh-language record to reach the Top 20 of the UK album charts, and has frequently been called the biggest-selling Welsh language album of all time. As {{a result of the}} record's success, Mwng was mentioned in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom by Plaid Cymru's Elfyn Llwyd, who called on his fellow politicians to congratulate the band on their [...] "chart topping new album" [...] and recognise Mwng as a celebration of a [...] "new wave of confidence in the Welsh nation". Rhys dismissed Llwyd's statement, saying that the record is very personal and has [...] "bugger <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with a celebration".|$|E

Primor noted: [...] "One explanation for [...] strange behavior might be found in the fact that Grass (who despite his poem is probably not the bitter enemy of Israel that one would imagine) had certain personal difficulties with Israel." [...] Primor said that during Grass's earlier visit to Israel, he [...] "was confronted with the anger of an Israeli public that booed him in successive public appearances. To be sure, the Israeli protestors were not targeting Grass personally and their anger had nothing at <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with his literature. It was the German effort to establish cultural relations with Israel to which they objected. Grass, however, did not see it that way and may well have felt personally slighted." ...|$|E

At this meeting Richard Martin contradicted the impression held in public circles that he had founded the Society: [...] "I have nothing at <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it," [...] he said [...] "it is quite a child of Mr Broome's and he has acted the part of a good father to it."

2500|$|After the Reactionaries disbanded, Boon and Watt formed Minutemen in January 1980. Watt {{has said}} their name had nothing at <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the brevity of their songs; rather, it was derived partly from the fabled minutemen militia of colonial times and partly to lampoon a right-wing reactionary {{group of the}} 1960s that went by that name. In the {{documentary}} We Jam Econo, Watt also states that the name was a play on [...] "minute" [...] ( [...] ). After a month with no drummer, during which Boon and Watt wrote their first songs, the band rehearsed and played a couple of early gigs with local welder Frank Tonche on drums. The group had originally wanted George Hurley to join, but he had joined a hardcore punk band called Hey Taxi! with Michael Ely and Spider Taylor after the Reactionaries disbanded. Tonche quit the group, citing a dislike of the audience the band initially drew, and Hurley took over as drummer in June 1980. (Early rehearsal recordings with Tonche on drums later became the georgeless EP.) Their first live gig was as an opening band for Black Flag.|$|E

Kittil Kittilsen, who left Mayhem in 1988 after becoming a born-again Christian, expressed his concern for the unblack metal musicians: [...] "I think they're completely off the mark. I cannot seriously understand how they even manage to do it. They have missed the target completely. I mean, {{if you want to be}} a Christian, be it with all you've got, and if you want to be metal, be it with all you've got. If those people really took their faith seriously, and followed the instructions of the One they profess to believe in, they would never be found in a context like that. They are on collision course with Christian life and teaching. I say this because of my own experience, and because of what is written in the Bible; rock music, metal music has nothing at <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in a Christian setting!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{inside the}} house suddenly turned ugly when Dillon asked the teenagers what they felt about the LVF killing of UVF Mid-Ulster brigadier Richard Jameson, {{who had been a}} successful businessman and was extremely popular in the Portadown area. McIlwaine remained silent, however Robb had replied [...] "so fucking what, it's got fuck <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with me" [...] which Dillon had taken exception to. When he informed Robb that Jameson had been his good friend, Robb had made further disparaging comments which also angered Brown. Brown, out of earshot of the teenagers, had decided to assault Robb in retaliation, saying he would [...] "punch the head off Andrew". Neither Robb nor McIlwaine {{had been a member of}} any loyalist paramilitary organisation, although Robb had tenuous links to the LVF having been an associate of Billy Wright, and even photographed in 1996 at a march led by Wright. Writers Henry McDonald and Ian S. Wood alleged that, unknown to the teenagers, a UVF unit had gone to [...] "The Spot" [...] to seek out two known LVF individuals rumoured to have been involved in Jameson's killing; however, they had already left the nightclub by the time the UVF arrived. The UVF men encountered Robb and McIlwaine instead, and targeted them as LVF members implicated in Jameson's death.|$|E
2500|$|Manchester United {{were unable}} to defend their FA Cup title the {{following}} season, having instead been invited {{to compete in the}} inaugural FIFA Club World Championship in Brazil. The Football Association (FA) encouraged the club {{to take part in the}} new tournament as they believed it would help their bid to host the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Alex Ferguson initially suggested that The FA could allow his team a bye to a later round of the competition to help alleviate the fixture congestion that would arise from entering both competitions, but the FA suggested that Manchester United simply pull out of the FA Cup altogether, putting the club in what chairman Martin Edwards called a [...] "no-win" [...] situation. Edwards said: [...] "We're going to get criticised whatever we do. If we don't go people will say that we are selfish and only looking after ourselves and not prepared to help the 2006 World Cup bid. But we will also be criticised if we say we're not going to compete in the FA Cup." [...] The offer was also criticised by Manchester United fans, with Andy Walsh of the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association saying: [...] "They've shown very little offer of help in the past when United have looked to ease their fixture congestion.
