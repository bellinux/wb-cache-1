5000|$|... 2006: Volvo's [...] "Collision Warning with Auto Brake", {{developed}} {{in cooperation with}} Mobileye, was introduced on the 2007 S80. This system {{is powered by a}} radar/camera sensor fusion and provides a warning through a head up display that visually resembles brake lamps. If the driver does not react, the system pre-charges the brakes and increases the brake assist sensitivity to maximize driver braking performance. Later versions will automatically apply the brakes to minimize pedestrian impacts. In some models of Volvos, the <b>automatic</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> can be manually turned off. The V40 also included the first pedestrian airbag, when it was introduced in 2012.|$|E

50|$|The pilots {{rushed to}} land {{as soon as}} possible, leading to errors in {{judgment}} that included the crew's failure to complete the airline's pre-landing checklist before landing. This was a crucial event in the accident chain, as the crew overlooked multiple critical landing systems on the checklist. The flight crew failed to arm the automatic spoiler system, which automatically moves the spoiler control lever and deploys the spoilers upon landing. The pilots also failed to set the plane's <b>automatic</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system.</b> Autospoilers and autobrakes are essential to ensure the plane's ability to stop {{within the confines of}} a wet runway, especially one that is being subjected to strong and gusting winds. The flight crew also failed to set landing flaps, another item on the pre-flight checklist, but as the plane descended past 1000 feet m, the first officer realized the flaps were not set and the flight crew set a 40-degree flap setting for landing.|$|E

50|$|A 2012 {{study by}} the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety {{examined}} how particular features of crash-avoidance systems affected the number of claims under various forms of insurance coverage. The findings indicate that two crash-avoidance features provide the biggest benefits: (a) autonomous braking that would brake on its own, if the driver does not, to avoid a forward collision, and (b) adaptive headlights that would shift the headlights in the direction the driver steers. They found lane departure systems to be not helpful, and perhaps harmful, at the circa 2012 stage of development. A 2015 Insurance Institute for Highway Safety study found forward collision warning and <b>automatic</b> <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> reduced rear collisions.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>automatic</b> vacuum <b>brake.</b> This <b>system</b> {{was similar}} to the simple vacuum system, except that the {{creation}} of vacuum in the train pipe exhausted vacuum reservoirs on every vehicle and released the brakes. If the driver applied the brake, his driver's brake valve admitted atmospheric air to the train pipe, and this atmospheric pressure applied the brakes against the vacuum in the vacuum reservoirs. Being an <b>automatic</b> <b>brake,</b> this <b>system</b> applies <b>braking</b> effort if the train becomes divided or if the train pipe is ruptured. Its disadvantage is that the large vacuum reservoirs were required on every vehicle, and their bulk and the rather complex mechanisms were seen as objectionable.|$|R
5000|$|Despite its {{protruding}} engine cover, {{the modified}} engine compartment provided {{room for a}} second passenger within the cabin and is listed as [...] "conditional triple" [...] for short and long distances.

50|$|The MAK's {{preliminary}} report, {{issued the}} week of 25 September 2006, attributed the accident to pilot error, while finding {{that there was no}} problem with the engines or the aircraft.The autopilot and thrust controller were switched off by the crew at a height of 100m and could not have any effect on the landing and landing run. The couplings linking the thrust controller to the engine control linkage were uncoupled and were not connected to the linkage any more. No steering commands given by the thrust controller computer were recorded. The results of the investigation of the electronic guidance and engine control system (FADEС) testify to the efficiency of the system right up to when the airplane collided with the barriers. The airplane landed in the touchdown zone at Irkutsk airport at 22:43:40 in wheel control mode with engines running at idle. After landing, the spoilers were automatically deployed and the <b>automatic</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> (ABS) was automatically switched on in LOW mode. 1.5 seconds after touchdown, the airplane captain set the reverse thrust lever for the right engine to the reverse mode. The right engine correctly went into reverse thrust mode. The reverse thrust lever for the left engine was not applied.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made to}} determine the feasibility of an <b>automatic</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> for arresting the motion of an airplane by sensing and controlling braked wheel decelerations. The system was tested on a rotating drum dynamometer by using an automotive tire, wheel, and disk-brake assembly under conditions which included two tire loadings, wet and dry surfaces, {{and a range of}} ground speeds up to 70 knots. The controlling parameters were the rates at which brake pressure was applied and released and the Command Deceleration Level which governed the wheel deceleration by controlling the brake operation. Limited tests were also made with the <b>automatic</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> installed on a ground vehicle in an effort to provide a more realistic proof of its feasibility. The results of this investigation indicate that a braking system which utilizes wheel decelerations as the control variable to restrict tire slip is feasible and capable of adapting to rapidly changing surface conditions...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{introduction}} of active and passive safety systems into modern cars has contributed to a high standard of safety for the passengers. However, vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists still face a considerably higher risk of severe injuries, especially in urban traffic situations. In this way, the number of total fatalities in traffic crashes in the USA decreased from 42836 to 32719 between the years 2004 and 2013, {{but the number of}} pedestrian fatalities remained constant around 4500. But fortunately, due to new technologies such as vehicle-to-infrastructure (V 2 I) and vehicleto- vehicle communication (V 2 V), networked vehicles can be provided with additional sensor information about their environment, which offers a great potential for advanced driver assistance systems. That is the motivation of this thesis, which is about developing a functional system for pedestrian collision avoidance in urban intersections, assuming that precise information about the position and speed of the pedestrian is available. So the main objective of the work is to detect the possible future collisions from this information. Moreover, as it is necessary for validating the detection methods, an <b>automatic</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> is also considered. The major output of this thesis is the implementation of one system which, in the simulation, really detects impending collisions, alerts the driver about them and truly avoids them by activating an <b>automatic</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E
