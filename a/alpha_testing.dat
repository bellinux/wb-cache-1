5|$|PokerTracker 4 is poker {{tracking}} {{software that}} designed for {{several types of}} online poker: No-Limit, Limit, or Pot-Limit cash games, Sit N’ Go’s and Multi-Table Tournaments for both Texas Holdem and Omaha players. It is compatible with almost all online poker websites' software and interfaces. PokerTracker 4 began public beta testing in March 2012. In August 2012, the company commercially launched a Microsoft Windows version of PokerTracker 4. In January 2013 as PokerTracker version 4.05.10 was rolled out, the company began <b>alpha</b> <b>testing</b> an Apple OS X version of the software. PokerTracker 4 was produced from scratch rather than by refining PokerTracker 3 and other earlier versions.|$|E
5|$|Prior to release, {{the game}} had been playtested {{multiple}} {{times by the}} general public. An alpha version of Evolve, called the 'Big Alpha' was released for Xbox One on October 31, 2014, The alpha version of Evolve was originally set to be released for the PlayStation 4 a day later on October 31, 2014, but was delayed to November 3, 2014 due to technical issues related to PS4's firmware update. As compensation, {{the duration of the}} demo was extended by a day, and ended on November 4, 2014 for all platforms. Players can play as the four classes of Hunters as well as the Goliath and Kraken in the alpha version. Turtle Rock expected 100,000 people to participate in the alpha. The team hoped that through the <b>alpha</b> <b>testing,</b> they could test the functionality of the game's servers, and make adjustments to the game's balance. Open beta trials of Evolve on Xbox One were held January 14–19, 2015. A limited test for the PlayStation 4 and PC was held January 16–19, 2015. Players could play as the first eight Hunters as well as the Goliath and Kraken in the beta. The Evacuation mode was also added to the beta on January 17, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to earlier}} {{recurring}} issues with mistranslations related to news updates, the team {{decided not to}} implement forums in the original release, instead hearing player feedback through fan sites and unofficial forums. Also because of mistranslation fears, dedicated teams {{in each of the}} game's release regions would gather feedback and transmit it to the development team. The game's first closed Alpha test began on March 11, 2010. It was available only to veteran players from XI. During <b>alpha</b> <b>testing,</b> the team used player feedback to find out key problems with the game, such as limitations on graphical adjustments making the game run at a slow frame rate. The open Beta test was originally scheduled to begin on August 31, but was indefinitely postponed due to the discovery of critical bugs in the game. The Beta test eventually went live on September 2, running until the game's release later that month. It was later stated that more time should have been given to fixing bugs during the Beta period. The game released on September 30, 2010, six months prior to the PS3 version's projected release date of March 2011. A Collector's Edition was released on September 22, allowing owners to log into the game from that date. The Collector's Edition, which was decorated by artwork from Amano and Yoshida, came with bonus items including a DVD featuring a behind-the-scenes documentary, a security token, a case for the game's box, and a decorated tumbler. The game was released with text in Japanese, English, French and German, while the spoken dialogue in cutscenes was English in all versions.|$|E
40|$|Regular {{practice}} of an <b>alpha</b> <b>test</b> in system acceptance test is to involve users, who are internal to the organization, {{which takes place}} at the developers' site. The aim of an <b>alpha</b> <b>test</b> is to get early feedbacks from users and to identify bugs in order for improvements to be made. Instead of carrying out regular <b>alpha</b> <b>test</b> activities, System Usability Scale (SUS) method is used in the <b>alpha</b> <b>test.</b> The main aim {{of this paper is to}} report on how the SUS is applied as a part of an acceptance test for a newly built multi-platforms application, known as Dengue-Entomological Surveillance (DES) system. The DES system is built both as an interactive mobile application and a hybrid web application that allows its end-users; Entomology and Pest Unit (EPU) team from State Health Office of Ministry of Health of Malaysia, to collect real-time data encompassing data from ovitraps installation, automatized data analysis, as well as, entomological surveillance operations' reports concerning dengue outbreaks. Experimental design and procedures of the <b>alpha</b> <b>test</b> were carefully planned and successfully implemented. Participants' (EPU team) demographic data, execution and completion time for given tasks, and user experience on DES system comprising usability, as well as, general comments and feedbacks from users were collected and analysed. The findings of the <b>alpha</b> <b>test</b> reveal a higher percentage total of SUS score usability of the web-based application with 72. 75 %, as compared to 68. 75 % for mobile-based application...|$|R

On July 18, 2013, it was announced that the game will be changed from a MMORTS to a MOBA. <b>Alpha</b> <b>test</b> begun once again on August 8, 2013 as a reworked game.|$|R
25|$|Although X10 offered {{interesting}} and powerful functionality, {{it had become}} obvious that the X protocol could use a more hardware-neutral redesign before it became too widely deployed, but MIT alone {{would not have the}} resources available for such a complete redesign. As it happened, DEC's Western Software Laboratory found itself between projects with an experienced team. Smokey Wallace of DEC WSL and Jim Gettys proposed that DEC WSL build X11 and make it freely available under the same terms as X9 and X10. This process started in May 1986, with the protocol finalized in August. <b>Alpha</b> <b>testing</b> of the software started in February 1987, beta-testing in May; the release of X11 finally occurred on 15 September 1987.|$|E
25|$|In March 2006, CCP made a {{deal with}} Optic Communications to start working on {{bringing}} Eve Online to the Chinese gaming audience. Closed <b>alpha</b> <b>testing</b> was held on a small cluster for some time, with about 3,000 players chosen from an initial pool of 50,000. The Chinese open beta test began on June 13, 2006, and proved to be very popular, gaining numbers comparable to Eve Onlines main server cluster. In order to avoid the shock of quickly adding thousands of new players to the current server (Tranquility), CCP Games decided to launch Eve in China on its own server (Serenity). In 2011, CCP allowed its licensing agreement with CDC Games, which had acquired Optic in July 2007, to expire. CCP created a new partnership with TianCity to relaunch Serenity on December 11, 2012.|$|E

500|$|Ultima Underworld uses {{two-dimensional}} sprites for characters, {{but also}} features 3D objects, {{as the team}} believed that it [...] "had to do 3D objects {{in order to have}} reasonable visuals". The game uses physics to calculate the motion of thrown objects. During the game's <b>alpha</b> <b>testing</b> phase, part of the programming team worked to create a smooth lighting model. The game's advanced technology caused the engine to run slowly, and its system requirements were extremely high. Doug Church later downplayed the importance of the game's technology, stating that technological advancement [...] "is somewhat inevitable in our field ... sadly, as an industry we seem to know much less about design, and how to continue to extend and grow design capabilities". Instead, he claimed that Ultima Underworlds most important achievement was its incorporation of simulation elements into a role-playing game.|$|E

40|$|Sequential {{tests for}} a stepped-up {{reliability}} esti-mator and coefficient alpha are developed. In {{a series of}} monte carlo experiments, {{the efficiency of the}} tests relative {{to each other and to}} fixed-sample tests is established, as well as the robustness of the <b>alpha</b> <b>test.</b> Both tests proved to be efficient, and the <b>alpha</b> <b>test</b> proved to be reasonably robust to deviations from normality and deviations from equal item error variances. On average, 47 % of the sample size can be saved if a sequential test is ap-plied instead of a fixed-sample test. Index terms: monte carlo simulation, reliability hypothesis tests, sampling theory for reliability estimators, sequential probability ratio test. Making an acceptable decision about a reliability estimator is an important psychometric problem...|$|R
