25|$|The {{most famous}} {{aspect of the}} {{production}} is Craig's use of a single, plain set that varied from scene to scene by means of large, abstract screens that altered {{the size and shape}} of the <b>acting</b> <b>area.</b> There is a persistent theatrical myth that these screens were impractical and fell over during the first performance. This myth may be traced to a passage in Stanislavski's My Life in Art (1924); Craig demanded that Stanislavski delete the story and Stanislavski admitted that the incident occurred only during a rehearsal. He eventually provided Craig with a sworn statement that the mishap was due to an error by the stage-hands and not the design of Craig's screens. The screens had been built ten feet taller than Craig's designs specified, which may have also contributed to the mishap. Craig had envisaged specially costumed, visible stage-hands to move the screens, but Stanislavski had rejected the idea. This forced a curtain close and delay between scenes, which disrupted the sense of fluidity and movement inherent to Craig's conception. The different arrangements of the screens for each scene were used to provide a spatial representation of Hamlet's state of mind or to underline a dramaturgical progression across a sequence of scenes, as visual elements were retained or transformed. In terms of costume design there were also differences between the two artists. For example, in the scene containing the dumb show Craig wished for the Actors to wear oversized masks, but Stanislavski despised this idea as it did not ring true to a realistic style of acting. Eventually there was a compromise which allowed the actors to wear makeup along with extravagant beards and wigs (Innes 158).|$|E
500|$|Konstantin Stanislavski and Edward Gordon Craig—two of the 20th century's most {{influential}} theatre practitioners—collaborated on the Moscow Art Theatre's seminal production of 1911–12. While Craig favoured stylised abstraction, Stanislavski, armed with his 'system,' explored psychological motivation. Craig conceived {{of the play}} as a symbolist monodrama, offering a dream-like vision as seen through Hamlet's eyes alone. This was most evident in the staging of the first court scene. The most famous aspect of the production is Craig's use of large, abstract screens that altered {{the size and shape}} of the <b>acting</b> <b>area</b> for each scene, representing the character's state of mind spatially or visualising a dramaturgical progression. The production attracted enthusiastic and unprecedented worldwide attention for the theatre and placed it [...] "on the cultural map for Western Europe".|$|E

2500|$|It was {{not until}} the 1970s that Glynne Wickham, first in an essay and then in his edition of the play, {{challenged}} this conception, arguing that the three stations had taken the form either of mobile [...] "pageants" [...] or fixed [...] "mansions" [...] grouped together on a single <b>acting</b> <b>area,</b> or [...] "platea". As William Tydeman points out, much hinges on how one interprets [...] "processyon" [...] in line 157 – as referring to a physical procession, or to the procession of the stage action. As this line is part of a passage marked [...] "si placet" [...] (i.e. optional) in the text, Wickham believes it hardly likely to have been a direction to the audience, and that it should be interpreted, along with [...] "proces" [...] in line 9 and 14, as signifying the thrust of an argument, and not physical movement. In his edition of 1993, Coldewey takes up a revisionist stance, believing that the play was processional in nature and clearly unconvinced by Wickham's argument.|$|E
50|$|There are as {{many types}} of theaters as there are types of performance.

Some theaters may have a fixed <b>acting</b> <b>area</b> (in most theaters this is known as the stage), while some theaters, such as black box theaters, may not, allowing the director and designers to construct an <b>acting</b> <b>area</b> suitable for the production.|$|E

5000|$|Cycloramas {{are often}} used to create the {{illusion}} of a sky onstage. By varying the equipment, intensity, color and patterns used, a lighting designer can achieve many varied looks. A cyclorama can be front lit or, if it is constructed of translucent and seamless material, backlit directly or indirectly {{with the addition of a}} white [...] "bounce" [...] drop. To achieve the illusion of extra depth, often desirable if one is re-creating a sky, the cyclorama can be paired with a [...] "sharkstooth scrim" [...] backdrop. A dark or black scrim, by absorbing the extraneous light which is commonly reflected off the floor of the stage from the <b>acting</b> <b>areas,</b> can help the lighting designer achieve deeper colors on the cyclorama.

40|$|This article {{provides}} a contribution towards the mechanistic understanding of surface phenomena observed during the corrosion of Mg-based substrates {{particularly in the}} low anodic polarization range. The concept considers the recent literature explaining cathodic hydrogen evolution from noble <b>acting</b> <b>areas</b> even during global anodic polarization. Heavy metal impurities in the ppm range or intermetallics are always present even in highly pure magnesium. Their potential effect was investigated here in more detail. The experimental results contribute to understanding the role of iron impurities in dark area formation and suggest a way for linking the observed phenomena to the recent literature. The shown enhanced cathodic activity of dark areas especially at the corrosion front and the superfluous hydrogen are linked to an iron re-deposition mechanism due to iron reduction. The proposed mechanism {{is based on the}} results obtained from innovative characterisation techniques using magnetic fields, diffraction experiments and transmission electron microscopy, which show the formation of iron rich zones, especially at the corrosion front offering ïn statu nascendi" metallic Fe films acting as active cathodes for hydrogen reduction...|$|R
