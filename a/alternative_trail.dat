40|$|This work {{introduces}} and {{explores the}} potential of using intelligent agent based modeling and simulation {{as a tool for}} examining the complex interactions between recreators and the environment, and interactions between recreators as a means to improving the our understanding of the recreational use of wildland settings. In this research the concept of rule driven autonomous agents as surrogates for human visitors is introduced. Agents are designed to represent the actions of the individual recreators (hiking, mountain bike riding, and pink jeep tour outfitters). Behavioural rules are derived from visitor surveys and interviews conducted in Broken Arrow Canyon, Arizona. The autonomous agents can be seen to dynamically move over a GIS based model of the Broken Arrow landscape. Line-of-sight calculations determine whether an individual agent is able to 'see' other agents and are used as method to record 'actual' and 'perceived' encounters with other agents. Using agent location maps combined with the underlying GIS data the agents can be observed moving across the landscape, pausing, changing pace, lingering at a view-point etc. A discussion focuses on analysing the resulting behaviours found in these simulations and additionally to explore the influence of <b>alternative</b> <b>trail</b> alignments on recreator movement, congestion and crowding. Some potential future directions for this research are discussed. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E

The Bay to Bay Trail is named such because it would extend from Good Harbor Bay south to Platte Bay. The project {{was sponsored by the}} Rivers, Trails, and Conservation Assistance Michigan Office of the National Park Service and The Friends of Sleeping Bear Dunes. The team’s process included research into similar trails, field investigations and analyses, and development of a conceptual design for the trail that includes <b>alternative</b> <b>trail</b> routes, campgrounds, and kayak launch sites. The team gauged interest in the trail and gathered input through interviews with local outfitters and user groups. In addition, perspectives on paddlers’ and hikers’ preferences on trail qualities and amenities were gathered through a set of surveys. Finally, a campground matrix was created to assess and evaluate potential campground sites along the trail. The team’s survey and interview findings, maps of trail, campground, and launch site alternatives will be used in the Environmental Assessment of the trail. The water trail and kayak launch site data and analysis will directly benefit Michigan’s contribution to the Lake Michigan Water Trail: a four-state effort to create a contiguous water trail around the perimeter of Lake Michigan. Conceptual designs of the campgrounds, launch sites, and trail signage will be used in public meetings. Additionally, the team created mock-ups for a website and brochure to be used by Friends of Sleeping Bear Dunes and the Park. In sum, the project will aid in the actualization of a dual water/hiking trail: an unprecedented recreational feature in Michigan...|$|E

40|$|In October and November of 2007, The Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) of The University of Texas at San Antonio {{conducted}} an intensive pedestrian archaeological {{survey of the}} South Salado Creek located in San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas. The work was conducted in advance of construction of a multi-use greenway trail between Rigsby Avenue to Southside Lion’s Park East along the Salado Creek proposed by the Parks and Recreation Department of the City of San Antonio and to fulfill contract requirements with Rehler, Vaughn 2 ̆ 6 Koone, Inc. (RVK) of San Antonio. RVK, in turn, {{was hired by the}} City of San Antonio. The survey was conducted under the requirements of the City of San Antonio Unified Development Code Chapter 35, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, and the Texas Antiquities Code. The survey was performed under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4702, with Dr. Steve Tomka, CAR Director, serving as Principal Investigator and Leonard Kemp serving as the Project Archaeologist. This report summarizes the results of the archaeological investigation, and provides recommendations regarding the management of cultural resources located in the project area. Pedestrian reconnaissance, and shovel tests were used to search for cultural resources within the project right of way (ROW). One archaeological site, 41 BX 1756 was found and recorded within the project area. It is a site with both prehistoric and historic components. The historic component consists of the remains of a house and an agricultural processing structure. In addition, two shovel tests adjacent to the facility were positive for prehistoric artifacts including debitage and burned rock. Field, laboratory and archival investigations suggest that neither the prehistoric nor historic components have significant research value. CAR recommends that because this site falls within the <b>alternative</b> <b>trail</b> designation the primary trail be utilized to avoid any impact to the site. In summary, because no significant deposits were found within the depth of impact along the proposed alignment, CAR recommends that the development of the South Salado Creek Greenway project proceed as planned. Artifacts collected and records generated during this project were prepared for curation according to Texas Historical Commission guidelines and are permanently curated at the Center for Archaeological Research at the University of Texas at San Antonio...|$|E

40|$|We used a {{recently}} proposed graph index to investigate connectivity redundancy in resting state MEG recordings. Usually, brain network analyses consider indexes {{linked to the}} shortest paths between cerebral regions. However, important information might be lost about <b>alternative</b> <b>trails</b> by neglecting longer pathways. We measured the redundancy of the connectivity by considering the multiple paths {{at the global level}} (i. e., scalar redundancy), across different path lengths (i. e., vector redundancy), and between node pairs (i. e., matrix redundancy). We applied this approach to a robust frequency domain functional connectivity measure, the corrected imaginary part of coherence. The redundancy in the MEG networks, for each frequency band, was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher than in the random graphs, thus, confirming a natural tendency of the brain to present multiple interaction pathways between different specialized areas. Notably, this difference was more evident and localized among the channels covering the parietooccipital areas in the alpha range of MEG oscillations (7. 5 – 13 [*]Hz), as expected in the resting state conditions. Interestingly enough, the results obtained with the redundancy indexes were poorly correlated with those obtained using shortest paths only, and more sensitive with respect to those obtained by considering walk-based indexes...|$|R

40|$|FM's failure {{management}} to capture its cherished {{place in the}} business support pantheon has been subject of much recent comment. This paper presents an overview of how that contribution might be expressed drawing on research-based evidence from offices, universities, hospitals and retail facilities. Only in a business that conceives itself as running a facility will FM approach a core competence, that is to carry both strategic and operational risks of failure. Business critical aspects of FM in a given context are those where the operational risk of failure is high yet the service is not a strategic competence of the organisation concerned. Operational risk is conceived along two dimensions: impact on the “customer” and impact on licence to operate: the legal, social and employee respect a business needs. While some correspondence with Nutt's four <b>alternative</b> <b>trails</b> {{can be seen as}} applying more strongly in separate fields of the resulting impact matrix there is no conclusive fit. The financial trail is arguably important in any sector but requires providers armed with skills and knowledge relevant to the critical impacts on the sector served and “clients” skilled at managing relationships. Otherwise different alignments are suggested of FM with, respectively, HR/KM, sales and marketing, operations/engineering or strategy in the four quadrants of the model presented. Rather than seeking one coherent future the argument is therefore, offered that business critical FM concerns itself more with different competencies in different sectors. </p...|$|R

It is found that covering slurry tanks with either straw or a floating lid is profitable.

When applying animal manure, injection is a profitable <b>alternative</b> to <b>trailing</b> hoses in spring crops before sowing and in many forage crops, as it gives higher yields and sometimes also higher protein content.

40|$|The Greenway Master Plan is a {{guide for}} {{developing}} a multi-user trail {{in the town of}} Portsmouth, Rhode Island. This report provides a comprehensive approach to implementing a trail from Melville to The Glen, called The Watershed Trail. While it focuses on integrating important aspects of the natural and human environment for one segment of trail, the report could be used to direct the community in developing an island-wide system of various types of publicly accessible trails. The goal of developing the trail is multi-purposed. First, islanders have expressed a desire to develop off-road pathways that link their homes, shopping, employment and recreation destinations by bicycle or walking. Still others want more bridle paths and in-line skating trails. Secondly, islanders want to manage development by directing growth in appropriate areas and have considered greenway development to be a partial solution. Several forms of data collection were used and analyzed to identify <b>alternatives</b> for <b>trail</b> development. First, Geographical Information Systems (GIS) mapping was analyzed to identify the most appropriate corridor. Considerations were given to existing conservation lands, unconserved environmental resources, and important sites and destinations. Next, the entire trail corridor was walked and field notes were recorded of the existing conditions. Photography and orthophotography provided additional information about the resources on the landscape. Finally, a Greenway Master Plan map was produced using land use information from GIS and other graphics to illustrate the opportunities and constraints to trail development. After analyzing this information, alternatives were chosen and final conclusions were made...|$|R
40|$|Different {{forms of}} outdoor {{recreation}} have different spatiotemporal activity patterns {{that may have}} interactive or cumulative effects on wildlife through human disturbance, physical habitat change, or both. In western North America, shrub-steppe habitats near urban areas are popular sites for motorized recreation and nonmotorized recreation and can provide important habitat for protected species, including golden eagles. Our objective {{was to determine whether}} recreation use (i. e., number of recreationists) or recreation features (e. g., trails or campsites) predicted golden eagle territory occupancy, egg-laying, or the probability a breeding attempt resulted in ≥ 1 offspring (nest survival). We monitored egg-laying, hatching and fledging success, eagle behavior, and recreation activity within 23 eagle territories near Boise, Idaho, USA. Territories with more off-road vehicle (ORV) use {{were less likely to be}} occupied than territories with less ORV use (β = − 1. 6, 85 % CI: − 2. 8 to − 0. 8). At occupied territories, early season pedestrian use (β = − 1. 6, 85 % CI: − 3. 8 to − 0. 2) and other nonmotorized use (β = − 3. 6, 85 % CI: − 10. 7 to − 0. 3) reduced the probability of egg-laying. At territories where eagles laid eggs, short, interval-specific peaks in ORV use were associated with decreased nest survival (β = − 0. 5, 85 % CI: − 0. 8 to − 0. 2). Pedestrians, who often arrived near eagle nests via motorized vehicles, were associated with reduced nest attendance (β = − 11. 9, 85 % CI: − 19. 2 to − 4. 5), an important predictor of nest survival. Multiple forms of recreation may have cumulative effects on local populations by reducing occupancy at otherwise suitable territories, decreasing breeding attempts, and causing nesting failure. Seasonal no-stopping zones for motorized vehicles may be an <b>alternative</b> to <b>trail</b> closures for managing disturbance.

Yet for a truly global event we would expect a contemporaneous change in Africa absolute plate motion (APM) reflected by physical evidence distributed on the Africa Plate. This evidence has been postulated to {{take the form of}} the Réunion-Mascarene bend which exhibits many HEB-like features, such as a large angular change close to∼chron 21.

40|$|PURPOSE: Environmental {{initiatives}} to support walking are keys to non-communicable disease prevention, but the relevant evidence comes mainly from cross-sectional studies. We examined neighborhood environmental attributes associated cross-sectionally with walking and those associated prospectively with walking maintenance. METHODS: Data {{were from the}} Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle study collected in 2004 - 05 (baseline) and in 2011 - 12 (follow-up). Participants who did not move residence {{during the study period}} (n= 2684, age range: 30 - 77 at baseline) were categorized as regular walkers (walked 5 times/week or more) or not at baseline. Regular walkers were divided into those who stopped and those who maintained regular walking at follow-up. Regression analyses examined relationships of regular walking and walking maintenance with perceived attributes of neighborhood destinations and pedestrian environments. RESULTS: Regular walking at baseline was significantly associated with availability of shops (OR: 1. 13, 95 %CI: 1. 04, 1. 22), many alternative routes (OR: 1. 12, 95 %CI: 1. 01, 1. 23), park or nature reserve (OR: 1. 13, 95 %CI: 1. 02, 1. 26), bicycle or walking tracks (OR: 1. 08, 95 %CI: 1. 00, 1. 17), and feeling safe to walk (OR: 1. 18, 95 %CI: 1. 01, 1. 38). The maintenance of regular walking was associated with availability of multiple alternative routes (OR: 1. 19, 95 %CI: 1. 03, 1. 38). Having many alternative routes and walking tracks were associated with walking maintenance among those who were not or had stopped working. CONCLUSION: Neighborhood destinations (shops, parks) and pedestrian environments (<b>alternative</b> routes, walking <b>trails,</b> safety from crime) were found to be associated with regular walking, but only pedestrian environment attributes were found {{to be related to the}} maintenance of regular walking. Further evidence from prospective studies is required to identify other neighborhood environmental attributes that might support walking maintenance...|$|R
