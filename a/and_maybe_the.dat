5|$|The {{due process}} clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments apply {{generally}} to {{all stages of}} criminal proceedings.

Due process is also the catchall vehicle for the enforcement of fundamental fairness, even if the infirmities of a given prosecution do not neatly sound in another enumerated provision.|$|E
5|$|Remarkably, though {{hundreds}} {{of homes and}} other structures were leveled, no one was killed by tornadoes that day. Tornado damage caused about 140 injuries, mostly minor, and one death and 11 injuries were caused by wind damage. In just five hours, the storms produced more than 12,500 lightning strikes. The airport in Oxford, Connecticut recorded 4.4inches (112mm) of rain in just 30 minutes. While the northeastern United States experiences occasional tornadoes, an event of this scale is especially rare. Typical tornadoes {{in this area are}} short-lived and not particularly damaging. This outbreak featured several long-lived tornadoes, produced by storms which also produced destructive non-tornadic winds over a large area. Since 1950, only six violent tornadoes have occurred in the Northeastern US, two of which were part of this outbreak. It was by far the worst tornado event in the area since May 2, 1983, when six significant tornadoes tore through New York, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> worst since the Worcester Tornado.|$|E

In another documented version, This family could have come originally from Benta‘el in the Jbeil region.

25|$|In a {{three-way}} conversation, Tafoya talked and translated between Parker and Nolan. The goals {{of all parties}} were different. Tafoya's and Parker's goal {{were the most important}} to them. And despite a history of hostility between them, Tafoya apparently agreed to mislead the soldiers for the return of his stock plus interest. He deliberately translated parts of the conversation wrong to Nolan. Somehow through the three-way conversation and translations, Nolan quickly realized that some type of deal was made between Parker and the half-breed Tafoya. At that point Nolan began to lose critical trust in his primary trail guide.

Had the Rockets made the deal, Olajuwon states the Rockets could have selected Michael Jordan with the number two pick to play alongside Olajuwon and Drexler, who had established chemistry playing together during their Phi Slama Jama days in college. Sportswriter Sam Smith speculates that such a trade [...] "would have changed league history <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> entire Michael Jordan legend".

500|$|The second album, Barrett, was {{recorded}} more sporadically than the first, with sessions taking place between February and July 1970. The album {{was produced by}} David Gilmour, and featured Gilmour on bass guitar, Richard Wright on keyboard and Humble Pie drummer Jerry Shirley. The first two songs attempted were for Barrett to play and/or sing to an existing backing track. However, Gilmour thought they were losing the [...] "Barrett-ness". One track ("Rats") was originally recorded with Barrett on his own. That would later be overdubbed by musicians, despite the changing tempos. Shirley said of Barrett's playing: [...] "He would never play the same tune twice. Sometimes Syd couldn't play anything that made sense; other times what he'd play was absolute magic."

500|$|Tom {{establishes}} {{that the}} island has {{some control over}} whether characters can die, as demonstrated when Michael unsuccessfully attempts to commit suicide three times. Kitsis thought that [...] "It was interesting what [...] said to Michael … that really carries through Michael's arc." [...] Later in the season, Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) tries to shoot Michael in the head, but the gun jams and the next day, {{a manifestation of the}} island in the form of Christian Shephard (John Terry) appears before Michael. Damon Lindelof confirmed that the island's [...] "cosmic intervention of fate" [...] also played a part in the car crash that foiled Jack's suicide attempt in the third-season finale. Following the broadcast of the fourth midseason premiere, Lindelof further confirmed that this island force prevents Ben and Widmore from dying. Cuse has said that [...] "There is a raging debate on the show about what constitutes free will and what constitutes destiny and Michael's story was sort of a argument on the destiny side of that equation. He had more destiny to fulfil with that island than he anticipated <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> audience anticipated." [...] Elizabeth Sarnoff stated that [...] "the island doesn't let you go until it's done with you and I think that the rest of our characters are going to feel the reverberations of that, as well." ...|$|E

500|$|Jack Shepherd of The Independent was {{slightly}} {{more critical of}} the early episodes of the season, saying the ideological battle between Murdock and Castle [...] "is the crux of these first few episodes and also highlights the main problem with Daredevil" [...] pointing out that [...] "there is no real bad guy here" [...] and there [...] "is only so many times you can watch an episode end with Daredevil and Punisher beating each other up before you start thinking there is a glitch in the Matrix." [...] He also agreed with Fitzpatick regarding Curtis-Hall's presence as Ben Urich not being filled in the season. Despite this, Shepherd added that the season began to pick up by the fourth episode, {{with the introduction of}} Elektra, capping with episodes six and seven, which he called [...] "by far the season’s best, laying the foundation for an exciting story ahead", while also praising Cox, Henson, Woll, Bernthal and Yung for their performances. Daniel Fienberg, reviewing the first seven episodes for The Hollywood Reporter, expressed similar sentiments as Shepherd, feeling the episodes missed what Vincent D'Onofrio brought as Wilson Fisk in the first season, or at least [...] "the through-line threat that he presented...Fortunately, the [...] are vividly realized and the action is still visceral and brutal <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> big picture will emerge in the season's second half. Because of the portrayals of those two characters, he felt [...] "that there's a challenge to remain wholly invested in plotlines that don't involve them". Despite being [...] "right on the edge of desensitization" [...] regarding the fight scenes, Fienberg still praised them, highlighting the different styles Elektra and the Punisher used [...] "vary the dynamic enough".|$|E
500|$|New York Dolls {{nonetheless}} received widespread acclaim {{from contemporary}} critics. In a rave review for NME, Nick Kent said the band's raunchy style {{of rock and}} roll was vividly recorded by Rundgren on an album that, besides Iggy and the Stooges' Raw Power (1973), served as the only one [...] "so far to fully define just exactly where 1970s rock should be coming from". Trouser Press founder and editor Ira Robbins viewed New York Dolls as an innovative record and found the band's music brilliantly chaotic and well produced by Rundgren. Ellen Willis, writing for The New Yorker, said it was by far the year's most compelling hard rock album and that at least half of its songs were immediate classics, particularly [...] "Personality Crisis" [...] and [...] "Trash", which she called [...] "transcendent". In Newsday, Christgau hailed the New York Dolls as [...] "the best hard rock band in the country <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> world right now", writing that their [...] "special genius" [...] was combining the shrewd songwriting savvy of early-1960s popular music with the anarchic sound of late-1960s heavy metal. He believed the record's frenzied approach, various emotions, and wild noise conveyed Manhattan's harsh, deviant thrill better than the Velvet Underground. In a less enthusiastic review, Rolling Stone critic Tony Glover believed the band's impressive live sound was mostly preserved on the album, but he was slightly critical of production flourishes and overdubs, feeling they made some lyrics incomprehensible and some choruses too sonorous. Although he was surprised Rundgren's production worked well with the group's raunchy sound on most of the songs, Glover ultimately asked whether or not [...] "the record alone will impress as much as seeing them live (they're a highly watchable group)." ...|$|E
500|$|The Ninja Gaiden games {{gained a}} {{reputation}} throughout the gaming community for their difficulty and attention to detail. Although they appealed to gamers who, like Pro-G's Struan Robertson, wanted a [...] "bloody hard, but also bloody good" [...] challenge, it was feared that casual gamers would find the learning curve daunting. IGN warned that gamers with lesser skills might not [...] "get as much out of this game as others due to [...] incredible difficulty", and Edge commented that [...] "Tecmo’s refusal to extend any kind of handhold to less dedicated players is simply a failure of design, not a badge of hardcore honour" [...] and [...] "it’s impossible to believe they couldn’t {{have found a way}} to increase the accessibility of the game without undermining the gloriously intractable nature of the challenges it contains." [...] EGM found the challenge to be [...] "rewarding" [...] as it [...] "motivates you to actually get better at the game." [...] Clive Thompson focused on Ninja Gaiden in his Slate article examining the motivation for playing difficult games. He contends that extreme levels of challenge can be initially very frustrating and may cause a game to be abandoned in disgust. However, where a game also rewards a player's perseverance by teaching the skills required to overcome its challenges, that player will have the motivation to finish the game. Ninja Gaiden, in his opinion, strikes the correct balance between challenge and reward; completion brings [...] "a sort of exhausted exhilaration, like finally reaching the end of War and Peace." [...] In 2012, CraveOnline included it on their list of five [...] "badass ninja games", calling it [...] "the pinnacle of action gaming at the time, holding onto that crown for an entire year until God of War released in 2005" [...] and [...] "a true video game classic, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> best ninja game of all time."
