40|$|<b>Ammonia</b> <b>stripping</b> is {{a simple}} {{desorption}} process used to lower the ammonia content of a wastewater stream. Some wastewaters contain large amounts of ammonia and/or nitrogen-containing compounds that may readily form ammonia. It is often easier and less expensive to remove nitrogen from wastewater {{in the form of}} ammonia than to convert it to nitrate-nitrogen before removing it (Culp et al., 1978). Ammonia (a weak base) reacts with water (a weak acid) to form ammonium hydroxide. In <b>ammonia</b> <b>stripping,</b> lime or caustic is added to the wastewater until the pH reaches 10. 8 to 11. 5 standard units which converts ammonium hydroxide ions to ammonia gas according to the following reaction(s) : NH 4 + OH 6 H 2 O + NH 38 Figure 1 illustrates two variations of <b>ammonia</b> <b>stripping</b> towers, cross-flow and countercurrent. In a cross-flow tower, the solvent gas (air) enters along the entire depth of fill and flows through the packing, as the alkaline wastewater flows downward.

40|$|During this master thesis, the {{possibility}} of ammonia removal from digestate in combination with after hygienization has been investigated. The aim of the work was {{to see how much}} ammonia that could be removed but also the properties of other process parameters such as TS/VS content, pH and alkalinity of the digestate. It was also of interest to study the energy balances for a process that combines <b>ammonia</b> <b>stripping</b> with after hygienization. The purpose of hygienization in a biogas plant is to kill pathogens. To study <b>ammonia</b> <b>stripping</b> combined with after hygienization, a prototype of an ammonia stripper was built in a laboratory. The digestate was heated to the hygienization temperature of 70 °C and air was led through {{with the help of a}} peristaltic pump by the end of the system. Condensate was trapped in a bottle by cooling the tube and the gases were brought to another bottle containing 1 M sulfuric acid. Ammonia and sulfuric acid reacted and formed ammonium sulfate. The process was also tested with closed system using vacuum to decrease the boiling point and thereby create more condensate. The results from the experiments showed that with an air stripping process most of the ammonium was trapped in the sulfuric acid while with a vacuum process more ammonium was trapped in the condensate. The most important parameters to achieve a good ammonia removal were air flow and time. With the vacuum system, more condensate was removed. The removal of condensate could make it possible to recirculate process fluid from the stripping process and thereby save energy in the centrifugation part which is used to create a solid part of the bio digestate. It was concluded from the experiments that air stripping is more effective when it comes to ammonium recovery. The process could be improved by using higher air flow which could decrease the time to less than one hour, which is the desired hygienization time. However, it is desired to keep the pump flow as low as possible since it is energy consuming. A chemical increase of the pH would also be of interest to try since previous tests showed a strong correlation between high pH-value and good <b>ammonia</b> <b>stripping.</b> More tests overall are of interest to ensure a reliable result.

30|$|From {{this point}} of view, {{it would be very}} {{interesting}} to reduce the TAN content of the digestate. This TAN reduction can be achieved through biological, chemical or physical processes [12]. Biological processes, in which classical nitrification–denitrification is most often applied, are in fact removal techniques since they convert the ammonium present into nitrogen gas. Furthermore, the conditions for nitrification will also result in oxidation of the available organic carbon and thus will result in loss of biogas potential. Chemical and chemical-physical processes for ammonia removal can be rather classified as recovery techniques because they give rise to the precipitation of, e.g. struvite (MgNH 4 PO 4 · 6 H 2 O) from raw digestate or its supernatant [13]. However, such recovery techniques have their drawbacks, such as high cost of chemicals and the need to strictly control the pH [14]. Another technique for ammonium recovery can be performed via a stripping and scrubbing process. Since the digestate of an anaerobic digestion has both a high temperature and a high TAN content, it is very suitable for <b>ammonia</b> <b>stripping</b> [15]. <b>Ammonia</b> <b>stripping</b> can be realized by using air, steam or biogas to separate the gaseous NH 3 from the liquid phase.

When sulphuric acid is used to capture ammonia, an (NH 4) 2 SO 4 solution is formed [16].

In contrast to biogas with its high CO 2 content, the efficiency reduction observed for flue gas was significantly less pronounced. The later provides the additional benefit that its high thermal energy can be re-utilized in the stripping unit and it is therefore considered a viable alternative for air...|$|E
40|$|If {{nutrient}} removal {{is to be}} obtained in ponds treating sewage, the pH must be raised so that ammonia can desorb and phosphates can precipitate. In this paper it is shown that the pH increase in ponds can be predicted quantitatively from simple stoichiometry, taking into consideration physical and biological carbon dioxide removal, <b>ammonia</b> <b>stripping</b> and calcium carbonate precipitation. Biological CO 2 removal by photosynthesis is identified as the main process to effect pH increase in ponds. The rate of pH increase and consequently the required retention time depend on the net rate of CO 2 consumption, the extent of ammonium stripping, {{the characteristics of the}} influent (alkalinity and pH) as well as factors concerning the environment (temperature) and dimensions (depth) of the pond. A high pH (range 9 to 10) can be obtained in about 5 days if digested sewage is used (low organic material concentration), climate conditions are favourable and the pond is shallow (< 0. 5 m deep) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{thermophilic}} strain (D 2) {{identified as}} a Bacillus sp. was isolated from an aerobic digestor of swine waste after several months of operation at 55 degrees C. Aerobic thermophilic batch treatment of swine waste inoculated with strain D 2 was studied in a 4 -liter fixed-bed reactor. Stabilization of the waste was achieved in less than 30 h when the original chemical oxygen demand (COD) was between 15 and 20 g/liter or in less than 48 h when the COD was around 35 g/liter. When the COD was higher than 30 g/liter, the pH of the waste reached 9. 2 to 9. 5 during the treatment, and periodic adjustment of the pH to 8. 5 was necessary to maintain {{the activity of the}} biofilm. In this reactor, ammoniacal nitrogen was completely eliminated by desorption in less than 72 h of incubation. The different packing materials used resulted in similar rates of degradation of organic matter. The thermophilic treatment was also efficient in the 75 -liter digestor, and stabilization was achieved in approximately 50 h. A bank of 22 thermophilic bacterial strains originating from different environments and adapted to the thermophilic treatment of swine waste was established. This thermophilic treatment allows, in one step, rapid stabilization of the waste, elimination of the bad smell, and complete elimination of <b>ammonia</b> nitrogen by <b>stripping...</b>|$|R
30|$|Figure  2 b shows a {{schematic}} {{drawing of the}} stripping and scrubbing process. In the stripping part, the supernatant (thin fraction) of the digestate is continuously stirred using a magnetic stir bar and is continuously pumped over a Vigreux column at a flow rate of 7 L h− 1 using a peristaltic pump (Watson–Marlow 520 S, Belgium). The 2000  mL of supernatant used was obtained by centrifugation of 2450  mL digestate at 4000  rpm (Jouan C 412, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The ammonium present in the supernatant is volatized as ammonia through the combination of temperature increase and pH increase. As {{we did not want}} to deactivate the microorganisms present in this supernatant—as this could negatively influence further digestion—we were limited in both the temperature and pH increase that could be applied. We used a temperature of 323.15  K (50  °C), which was the temperature of the thermophilic reactor from which the original digestate was taken, and the pH was only increased from 7.8 to 8.5 using 4  M NaOH. The heating happened with a glass hot water bath and NaOH was added dropwise with an addition funnel of 0.25 L. During the stripping process, we aimed for a significant ammonium removal of 90 %; the monitoring was done through regular sampling. The air that is drawn through the system takes the <b>ammonia</b> from the <b>stripping</b> part to the scrubbing part, which initially contains 1 L H 2 SO 4 1  M. The sulphuric acid is also continuously stirred and pumped over a Vigreux column at a flow rate of 7 L.h− 1 resulting in the formation of (NH 4) 2 SO 4. The stirring (in both the stripping and scrubbing part) and heating (only in the stripping part) was accomplished by a Heating Magnetic Stirrer FB 15001 from Thermo Fisher Scientific (USA).|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to design (i) a {{stripper}} system where heat is used to <b>strip</b> <b>ammonia</b> (NH{sub 3 }) and carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) from a diluted draw solution; and (ii) a condensation or absorption system where the stripped NH{sub 3 } and CO{sub 2 } are captured in condensed water to form a re-concentrated draw solution. This study supports the Industrial Technologies Program of the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and their Industrial Energy Efficiency Grand Challenge award solicitation. Results from this study show that stimulated Oasys draw solutions composed of a complex electrolyte solution associated with the dissolution of NH{sub 3 } and CO{sub 2 } gas in water can successfully be stripped and fully condensed under standard atmospheric pressure. Stripper bottoms NH{sub 3 } concentration can reliably be reduced to < 1 mg/L, even when starting with liquids that have an NH{sub 3 } mass fraction exceeding 6 % to stimulate diluted draw solution from the forward osmosis membrane component of the process. Concentrated draw solution produced by fully condensing the stripper tops was show to exceed 6 M-C with nitrogen-to-carbon (N:C) molar ratios on the order of two. Reducing the operating pressure of the stripper column serves to reduce the partial vapor pressure of both NH{sub 3 } and CO{sub 2 } in solution and enables lower temperature operation towards integration of industrial low-grade of waste heat. Effective stripping of solutes was observed with operating pressures as low as 100 mbar (3 -inHg). Systems operating at reduced pressure and temperature require additional design considerations to fully condense and absorb these constituents for reuse within the Oasys EO system context. Comparing empirical data with process stimulation models confirmed that several key parameters related to vapor-liquid equilibrium and intrinsic material properties were not accurate. Additional experiments and refinement of material property databases within the chosen process stimulation software was required to improve the reliability of process simulations for engineering design support. Data from experiments was also employed to calculate critical mass transfer and system design parameters (such as the height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP)) to aid in process design. When measured in a less than optimal design state for the stripping of NH{sub 3 } and CO{sub 2 } from a simulated dilute draw solution the HETP for one type of commercial stripper packing material was 1. 88 ft/stage. During this study it was observed that the heat duty required to vaporize the draw solution solutes is substantially affected by the amount of water boilup also produced to achieve a low NH{sub 3 } stripper bottoms concentration specification. Additionally, fluid loading of the stripper packing media is a critical performance parameter that affects all facets of optimum stripper column performance. Condensation of the draw solution tops vapor requires additional process considerations if being conducted in sub-atmospheric conditions and low temperature. Future work will focus on the commercialization of the Oasys EO technology platform for numerous applications in water and wastewater treatment as well as harvesting low enthalpy energy with our proprietary osmotic heat engine. Engineering design related to thermal integration of Oasys EO technology for both low and hig-grade heat applications is underway. Novel thermal recovery processes are also being investigated in addition to the conventional approaches described in this report. Oasys Water plans to deploy commercial scale systems into the energy and zero liquid discharge markets in 2013. Additional process refinement will lead to integration of low enthalpy renewable heat sources for municipal desalination applications...|$|R
