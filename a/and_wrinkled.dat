ACA {{begins as a}} reddish-blue patch of discolored skin, often {{on the backs of}} the hands or feet.

50|$|The {{presence}} of both graben <b>and</b> <b>wrinkle</b> ridges within ghost craters is a feature unique to Mercury. This combination {{is because of}} the tectonic processes that formed the graben <b>and</b> <b>wrinkle</b> ridges. The graben <b>and</b> <b>wrinkle</b> ridges came from rapidly accumulating lava flows that cooled within impact craters while the planet was experiencing global contraction from interior cooling. Other planetary bodies such as the Moon and Mars do not have both tectonic features within their ghost craters, possibly due to the accumulation rates of volcanic material on the Moon and Mars being slower than the rates on Mercury.|$|R
50|$|Ghost craters on {{the planet}} Mercury have tectonic {{features}} such as graben <b>and</b> <b>wrinkle</b> ridges. These features were formed by extensional and contractional forces originating in tectonic processes such as uplift and global contraction.

25|$|While {{carrying}} out breeding experiments {{to clarify the}} mechanism of inheritance in 1900, Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns independently rediscovered Gregor Mendel's work. News of this reached William Bateson in England, who reported on the paper during a presentation to the Royal Horticultural Society in May 1900. In Mendelian inheritance, the contributions of each parent retain their integrity rather than blending with {{the contribution of the}} other parent. In the case of a cross between two true-breeding varieties such as Mendel's round <b>and</b> <b>wrinkled</b> peas, the first-generation offspring are all alike, in this case all round. Allowing these to cross, the original characteristics reappear (segregation): about 3/4 of their offspring are round, 1/4 wrinkled. There is a discontinuity between the appearance of the offspring; de Vries coined the term allele for a variant form of an inherited characteristic. This reinforced a major division of thought, already present in the 1890s, between gradualists who followed Darwin, and saltationists such as Bateson.|$|E
25|$|Samizdat distinguishes itself {{not only}} by the ideas and debates which it helped spread to a wider audience, but also by its {{physical}} form. The hand-typed, often blurry <b>and</b> <b>wrinkled</b> pages with numerous typographical errors and nondescript covers helped to separate and elevate Russian samizdat from Western literature. The physical form of samizdat arose from a simple lack of resources and the necessity to be inconspicuous. In time dissidents in the USSR began to admire these qualities for their own sake, the ragged appearance of samizdat contrasting sharply with the smooth, well-produced appearance of texts passed by the censor's office for publication by the State. The form samizdat took gained precedence over the ideas it expressed, and became a potent symbol of the resourcefulness and rebellious spirit of the inhabitants of the Soviet Union. In effect, the physical form of samizdat itself elevated the reading of samizdat to a prized clandestine act.|$|E

The cap of the Indo-Pacific species P.merulinus appears smooth when covered with gleba, and is pale <b>and</b> <b>wrinkled</b> once the gleba has worn off. In contrast, the cap surface of P.indusiatus tends to have conspicuous reticulations that remain clearly visible under the gleba. Also, the indusium of P.merulinus is more delicate and shorter than that of P.indusiatus, and is thus less likely to collapse under its own weight. Common in eastern North America and Japan, and widely recorded in Europe, the species P.duplicatus has a smaller indusium that hangs [...] {{from the bottom of the}} cap, and sometimes collapses against the stalk.|$|E

The lacrimal bone in front of the eye had a prominent, rugose crest (or horn) that pointed up at a backwards angle. The crest was ridge-like, and had deep grooves. The postorbital bone behind the eye had a down and backwards directed jugal process that projected into the orbit (eye opening), as seen in Tyrannosaurus, Abelisaurus, and Carnotaurus. The supraorbital bone above the eye that contacted between the lacrimal and postorbital bones was eave-like, and similar to that of Abelisaurus.

500|$|Nests are {{generally}} large and untidy, {{consisting of a}} bowl or platform of sticks lined with grasses, barks, and feathers that can be up to [...] thick. As they are relatively heavy, they are built on larger forks in trees rather than out in the canopy. Building the nest is often time-consuming initially as the birds try (and often fail) to wedge sticks, which are [...] long and [...] thick, into the tree fork to make a platform. Thinner sticks and rootlets are {{used to make the}} bowl before the bowl is lined with feathers. Both birds build the nest, with the female taking over the lining of the nest while the male brings her material. New nests are built each year generally, as the re-use of old ones might spread disease or parasites—nests become caked with faeces as the nestlings grow and the parents cannot keep up with its removal. Furthermore, old nests often disintegrate within twelve months due to their exposed locations. The female develops a brood patch—a patch of bare skin on the bird's underparts that reddens and becomes much more extensive from around three weeks before the first egg is laid. The skin itself is oedematous <b>and</b> <b>wrinkled,</b> and does not get re-feathered until December after the breeding season has finished.|$|E
