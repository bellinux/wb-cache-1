5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{encounter}} with Turbine, Radetzky managed to destroy a railroad bridge {{near the town of}} Fermo, severely hampering the movement of troops and supplies in the region. Sixty-three Italian civilians and military personnel were killed in the bombardment.

5|$|During the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in November 1917, Derfflinger sailed from port {{to assist}} the German light cruisers of the II Scouting Group, {{but by the time}} she and the other battlecruisers <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scene, the British raiders had fled northward.|$|E
5|$|Gen. Lee <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{battlefield}} {{at about}} 2:30 p.m., as Rodes's {{men were in}} mid-attack. Seeing that a major assault was underway, he lifted his restriction on a general engagement and gave permission to Hill to resume his attacks from the morning. First in line was Heth's division again, with two fresh brigades: Pettigrew's North Carolinians and Col. John M. Brockenbrough's Virginians.|$|E

5|$|In the afternoon, Sheaffe <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{battlefield}} with reinforcements {{and took}} {{command of the}} British forces. In sharp contrast to his predecessors' direct attacks, Sheaffe took a more cautious approach. This ultimately proved successful, leading to a total victory over the Americans.|$|E
5|$|Marking the Apollo 11 Moon {{landings}} in 1969, Hergé {{produced an}} illustration in which NASA astronaut Neil Armstrong has just <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> moon, {{only to be}} greeted by Tintin, Snowy, Haddock, and Calculus carrying roses and a sign welcoming him. That same year, the French magazine Paris Match commissioned him to produce a short comic documenting the Apollo 12 landings.|$|E
5|$|The Schwere Heeres Panzer Abteilung 501 (s.H.Pz.Abt. 501) <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Front {{with only}} {{eight out of}} 45 tanks operational; these faults were mostly due to {{drive-train}} failures.

5|$|When {{the line}} reopened in 1907 just one {{locomotive}} was used. This was a Beyer Peacock 4-4-0T built in 1879 for the Metropolitan Railway in London, it was number 37 of their A Class condensing locomotives.

5|$|After {{the battle}} ended, while Stark's militiamen were busy disarming the prisoners and looting their supplies, Breymann arrived with his reinforcements. Seeing the Americans in disarray, they {{immediately}} pressed their attack. After hastily regrouping, Stark's forces {{tried to hold}} their ground against the new German onslaught, but began to fall back. Before their lines collapsed, Warner's men <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scene to reinforce Stark's troops. Pitched battle continued until dark, when both sides disengaged. Breymann began a hasty retreat; he had lost one quarter of his force {{and all of his}} artillery pieces.|$|E

5|$|Although not well-studied, {{there is}} growing {{acceptance}} of three species of Malagasy hippopotamus. It is not known when or exactly how these hippos <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island of Madagascar. As hippos are semi-aquatic, {{it is possible that}} they survived the 400km (248mi) trek across the channel, although presumably when the water was shallower and there were perhaps small islands along the way. It is possible that the three species of hippopotamus represent three distinct and successful colonizations of the island. Hippos are the only endemic ungulates ever to have lived on Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Around noon, Wallace {{began the}} journey along the Shunpike, a route {{familiar}} to his men. A member of Grant's staff, William R. Rowley, found Wallace between 2 and 2:30p.m. on the Shunpike, after Grant wondered where Wallace was {{and why he}} had not <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> battlefield, while the main Union force was being slowly pressed backward. Rowley told Wallace that the Union army had retreated, Sherman was no longer fighting at Shiloh Church, and the battle line had moved northeast toward Pittsburg Landing. If Wallace continued in the same direction, he would have {{found himself in the}} rear of the advancing Confederate troops.|$|E

5|$|As {{luck would}} have it, the local king <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scene, and proved to be Olaf's alleged {{grandfather}} Myrkjartan. Olaf remained with Myrkjartan for a time, and the king, according to Laxdaela Saga, even offered to make Olaf his heir. Olaf, however, ultimately returned to Norway, afraid of provoking Myrkjartan's sons. Olaf returned {{to the court of}} King Harald, where he was greatly honored by both the king and his mother Gunnhild.|$|E
5|$|At 9:00pm three Guards regiments <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scene. Although {{the troops}} {{assisted}} in crowd control, their arrival {{was also a}} reaction of the authorities to fears of a possible insurrection, for which the destruction of parliament could have signalled the first step. The three European revolutions of 1830—the French, Belgian and Polish actions—were still of concern, as were the unrest from the Captain Swing riots, and the recent passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which altered the relief provided by the workhouse system.|$|E
5|$|Born in Castlemaine, Victoria, Peeler {{worked at}} various jobs {{in his home}} town and in the Melbourne area before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in February 1916.

In June 1917, his {{battalion}} participated in the assault on Messines ridge, where he was lightly wounded. Eight days after his Victoria Cross action, Peeler was severely wounded in his right arm {{and spent the next}} seven months recuperating in the United Kingdom. Following the armistice with Germany, he was discharged from service with the rank of sergeant in December 1918.|$|E
