50|$|Due to the {{involvement}} by the financier with a factored customer, the <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> on such invoices {{is higher than}} with a confidential facility.

50|$|The {{water can}} take a {{considerable}} {{period of time to}} reach the other end, meaning water has been infiltrating {{for a longer period of}} time at the top end of the field. This results in poor uniformity with high application at the top end with lower application at the bottom end. In most cases the performance of furrow irrigation can be improved through increasing the speed at which water moves along the field (the <b>advance</b> <b>rate).</b> This can be achieved through increasing flow rates or through the practice of surge irrigation. Increasing the <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> not only improves the uniformity but also reduces the total volume of water required to complete the irrigation.|$|E

The maximum <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> was realized at marine sediment zone with 18.0 m/day. Spent direct time for excavation and ringbuild were around 3,500 and 1,700 hours, respectively. In Trakya formation, 28 dyke zones were excavated with an average frequency of 90 m and thicknesses were varying between 1 and 120 m. Furthermore, 440 disc cutters, 85 scrapers and 475 brushes were replaced by TBM crew and four times hyperbaric maintenance operations (total of 45 days) with specially trained divers (max. under 10.8 bar {{first time in the}} world) were successfully performed.|$|E

50|$|The <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> is the {{percentage}} of an invoice that is paid out by the factoring company upfront. The difference between the face value of the invoice and the advance rates serves to protect factors against any losses and to ensure coverage for their fees.

50|$|If the {{operating}} parameter {{is higher than}} the optimum range, the user can reduce the knife <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> and use a tighter grade of filter aid. This will result in less filter aid used (lower capital cost) and less filter aid being removed (lower disposal cost). However, if {{the operating}} parameter is lower than the optimum range, the user can increase the knife advanced rate (more production) and decrease the drum speed for less filter air usage (reduced operating cost)5.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, twin tunnels (each has {{approximately}} 950 m length) were completed in 445 calendar {{days with a}} cross section of 85 m2 each by classical mining method. These tunnels were excavated in Trakya Formation from four faces with a 1.4 m/day/face <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> under a densely populated district with minimum and maximum overburden of 8 m and 41 m, respectively. Both tunnels met up each other within ±2 mm tolerance. The largest converge measured at the tunnel crown was 33 mm (design tolerance is 50 mm) with a maximum 10 mm surface settlement.|$|E

The game followed all official TCG rules. It was possible to play in <b>Advanced</b> (<b>Rated),</b> <b>Advanced</b> (Unrated), Traditional (Unrated), and Unlimited (Unrated). To play in these sections, players were able to access the Duel Room and choose the section they want to play in with a Deck that met the standards of that section.|$|R
50|$|Security {{requirements}} vary, but traditionally {{focus on}} the value of the debtors ledger, supported by a pledge of specific assets as collateral and a charge or mortgage over the business, along with the personal guarantees of directors. Apart from some specialised lenders, real estate security is not taken. By focusing on the value and collectability of the accounts receivable ledger, most debtor finance credit lines will automatically increase in response to increases in sales, and provide ongoing working capital to fund the growth of the business. Typically the <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> ranges from 70% of accounts receivable ledger value up to 90%. The remaining 30% to 10%, known as the 'retention' is released following receipt of payment of each invoice by the customer/debtor/buyer.|$|E
50|$|Major {{accessories}} for the F2 {{included the}} Nikon MD-1 (introduced in 1971) and MD-2 (1973) motor drives, providing automatic film advance up to 5 frames per second, 6 if the mirror was locked up, plus power rewind. They both required a Nikon MB-1 battery pack holding 10 AA or LR6 batteries in two Nikon MS-1 battery clips. Note that the 5 frame/s rate {{required that the}} F2 have its mirror locked up and the MD-1 or -2 be loaded with two Nikon MN-1 nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries. (These batteries are long since dead.) With the mirror operating, the maximum <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> is 4.3 frame/s; with AAs, the rate is 4 frame/s. The addition of the MD-1 or MD-2 greatly increased the overall weight of the camera. With a fully loaded MD-2/MB-1 and 50mm lens, the F2 would weigh in at just over six pounds.|$|E
50|$|In soft ground, {{there are}} three main types of TBMs: Earth Pressure Balance Machines (EPB), Slurry Shield (SS) and {{open-face}} type. Both types of closed machines operate like Single Shield TBMs, using thrust cylinders to advance forward by pushing off against concrete segments. Earth Pressure Balance Machines are used in soft ground with less than 7 bar of pressure. The cutter head does not use disc cutters only, but instead an combination of tungsten carbide cutting bits, carbide disc cutters, drag picks and/or hard rock disc cutters. The EPB gets its name because it uses the excavated material to balance the pressure at the tunnel face. Pressure is maintained in the cutterhead by controlling the rate of extraction of spoil through the Archimedes screw and the <b>advance</b> <b>rate.</b> Additives such as bentonite, polymers and foam can be injected ahead of the face to increase {{the stability of the}} ground. Additives can also be injected in the cutterhead/extraction screw to ensure that the spoil remains sufficiently cohesive to form a plug in the Archimedes screw to maintain pressure in the cutterhead and restrict water flowing through.|$|E

It was {{yet another}} {{titanium}} armored F2 but {{this time with a}} fixed (not reflex), semi-silvered, pellicle mirror, manual lens diaphragm control and a mechanically matched titanium-armored Nikon MD-100 high speed motor drive. The maximum shutter speed is 1/1000 (vs. 1/2000 for other F2 models). The self-timer and shutter settings 'B' and 'T' were omitted. The depth-of-field preview button was replaced with a 'Full-Aperture Viewing Button'. The Nikon MD-100 motor drive was {{a modified version of the}} MD-2 motor drive and was powered by the Nikon MB-100. The MB-100 consists of two MB-1 battery packs (20 AA or LR6 batteries, or four Nikon MN-1 nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries, providing 30 volts), weighing a massive 960 g empty and reaching 10 frames-per-second film <b>advance</b> <b>rate.</b> The F2H set included the Nikon MH-100 battery charger. All components (body, motor and batterypack) may be detached from each other.

Body serial numbers began with 7850001, e.g. 'F2 7850001'. Approximately 400 units were produced making the F2H extremely rare, the rarest of any 'production model' F2, and valuable.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{investigate}} numerically {{the evolution}} of surface settlement during continuous tunnel excavation by formulating and solving the poro-elasticity equations in a frame of reference, which is fixed to the moving face. In tunnelling through low-permeability soils, consolidation processes take place in general simultaneously with the spatial stress redistribution {{in the vicinity of}} the advancing face. Apart from the borderline case of highly permeable ground or very slow excavation, the excavation <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> must be taken into consideration. One can readily verify by a dimensional analysis that the time-development of settlement is governed by the ratio of <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> to ground permeability.
