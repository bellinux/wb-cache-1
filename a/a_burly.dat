25|$|To {{move the}} script along, Mailer {{presented}} {{the beginnings of}} Strawhead for critique to the Actors Studio Playwright And Directors Unit, an exclusive group to which Mailer belonged. The early draft had a clichéd Monroe giving a blowjob to the Mailer-interviewer character. In response to former Marilyn Monroe roommate and Academy Award winning actress Shelley Winters blasting Mailer's effort, Mailer rewrote the part to be <b>a</b> <b>burly</b> Maileresque feminist who burst into the play from the audience.|$|E

500|$|No {{authentic}} {{portrait of}} William has been found; the contemporary depictions {{of him on}} the Bayeux Tapestry and on his seals and coins are conventional representations designed to assert his authority. There are some written descriptions of <b>a</b> <b>burly</b> and robust appearance, with a guttural voice. He enjoyed excellent health until old age, although he became quite fat in later life. He {{was strong enough to}} draw bows that others were unable to pull and had great stamina. Geoffrey Martel described him as without equal as a fighter and as a horseman. Examination of William's femur, the only bone to survive when the rest of his remains were destroyed, showed he was approximately [...] in height.|$|E

Another man of the escort asks him, [...] "Was it good for us?" [...] to which Mićun answers affirmatively.

Disagreeing with Jerry on a philosophical issue, especially one dear to his heart can be a chastening experience....

500|$|Dan Adams of IGN {{rated the}} game 9.4 out of 10 and praised its {{improved}} visuals and expansive environments, but cited the short six-hour length as a drawback. He said: [...] "Any {{way you look}} at it, Episode Two stands out, even among the Half-Life series, as something special ... <b>a</b> <b>burly</b> experience packed into roughly six hours or so that offers up all the diversity, level design, and thoughtful gameplay we've known while making sure to propel the story forward and leave us wanting more." [...] Bit-tech.net awarded the game a 10 out of 10 score, citing approval of how the story turns and the introduction of side stories and new characters. 1UP.com praised the game, noting that the game's [...] "entire five-hour experience" [...] was [...] "vivid, emotionally engaging, and virtually unsurpassed." [...] PC Gamer UK also applauded Episode Two, noting it [...] "is the most sumptuous chapter of the Half-Life saga, and by a country mile." [...] The New York Times enjoyed the gameplay, saying, [...] "The battles in Episode 2 of Half-Life 2 often require as much ingenuity as they do fast reflexes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hughes' {{physical}} presence (<b>a</b> <b>burly</b> 6'4"), handlebar moustache, {{a penchant for}} exuberant displays of affection for his fellow players, and a tendency {{to talk to the}} opposition in inventively colourful language (his nickname was [...] "Fruitfly" [...] – a somewhat incongruous nickname until Allan Border explained it was a reference to [...] "Australia's greatest national pest"), and a (some would say) [...] "mincing" [...] run-up (that at times stretched to 45 paces), made him a firm favorite amongst supporters, who would often imitate his warm-up stretches behind him en masse.

He employs the Takeover magic [...] to steal the powers of any monster he encounters and assume its form.

2500|$|The {{staff at}} Variety {{magazine}} lauded the {{acting in the}} film, writing, [...] "Matewan is a heartfelt, straight-ahead tale of labor organizing in the coal mines of West Virginia in 1920 that runs its course like a train coming down the track. Among the memorable characters is Joe Kenehan (Chris Cooper), a young union organizer who comes to Matewan to buck the bosses. With his strong face and Harrison Ford good-looks, Cooper gives the film its heartbeat...Most notable of the black workers is 'Few Clothes' Johnson (James Earl Jones), <b>a</b> <b>burly</b> good-natured man with a powerful presence and a quick smile. Jones' performance practically glows in the dark. Also a standout is Sayles veteran David Strathairn as the sheriff with quiet integrity who puts {{his life on the}} line." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cooper was <b>a</b> <b>burly,</b> hard-hitting {{right-handed}} middle-order batsman and {{an irregular}} right-arm medium-pace bowler whose physique and style brought comparisons with Colin Milburn. He played for Wiltshire from 1967 and in 1970 made two centuries in the match against Somerset's Second Eleven in the Minor Counties Championship. He was then recruited to the first-class game by Somerset for the 1972 season. Business commitments restricted his first-class appearances for Somerset to just one, {{in which he}} scored only four runs, but he played fairly regularly in List A cricket and an innings of 95 in his first Benson and Hedges Cup game, against the Minor Counties, won him the Gold Award for the match. Wisden noted that he showed [...] "flair and temperament" [...] and that he [...] "proved to be a composed, powerful straight hitter in the one-day games". However, in 1973 he remained in Somerset's second team, making no first-team appearances, and following a further unproductive year in 1974 he returned to Wiltshire.|$|E

2500|$|A {{different}} {{tradition is}} first found in Josephus, who was read by Poussin and influenced {{his treatment of}} this and other biblical scenes. [...] His account of the finding has the princess [...] "playing by the river bank" [...] and spotting Moses being [...] "borne down the stream". She [...] "sent off some swimmers" [...] to fetch him. [...] Thus in Poussin's 1638 Finding in the Louvre <b>a</b> <b>burly</b> male emerges from the water with the child and basket, a detail sometimes copied by other painters. [...] This is followed in Sebastian Bourdon's painting of 1650, with two male swimmers. [...] Italian paintings more often show female swimmers, or at least females who have landed and are drying themselves after handing the baby to the princess, as in Sebastiano Ricci, Salvator Rosa, Giovanni Francesco Romanelli, {{as well as a}} painting in the Rijksmuseum by Paulus Bor and Cornelis Hendriksz Vroom from the 1630s, and Poussin's 1651 composition. [...] The only painting of the subject from Rembrandt's studio shows several naked women who have apparently just come out of the water, bringing the basket.|$|E
2500|$|During this time, Martín Fox, <b>a</b> <b>burly,</b> gregarious and well-connected gambler, began renting table {{space in}} the casino. Eventually, by 1950, he would amass enough profits {{to take over the}} lease of what would become The Tropicana. Martin Fox, born of English parents, came to Havana from the countryside. Nicknamed the [...] "Guajiro Fox," [...] for being a country bumpkin peasant, he became big in the numbers rackets. Raised in the country and uneducated, he was {{nonetheless}} bold and had close relations with more solvent groups. [...] Martin Fox is known to have a close friendship with Che Guevara and provided office {{space in the}} club and provided gifts including his own Rolex watch and a gold Parker pen, both bought in England whilst on a funding/resource visit. He was able to topple Victor de Correa within a few years and together with Alberto Ardura and Oscar Echemendia, form an entrepreneurial trilogy that made the Tropicana {{one of the most famous}} nightclubs on the continent. Hanging on through tough times, including a period with a temporary ban on casino gambling, Fox bought out de Correa's interest in 1951 and tapped Alberto Ardura Oscar Echemendia to replace him.|$|E
2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>burly</b> six-footer from South Africa, Hodgson had a {{reputation}} {{early in his career}} as an unselfish forward who excelled in link-up play but that didn't stop him going on to become one of Liverpool [...] and indeed the Football League's greatest-ever goalscorers. [...] Not averse to charging through defenders if other avenues to goal were barred, although he was capable of subtlety when the situation demanded it, Hodgson was exceptionally strong on the ball and possessed a terrific shot with either foot, which allied to his height, heading ability, pace, close-control, enthusiasm and a noted talent for shooting when going at top-speed made him a real force in attack. [...] Only Roger Hunt (244) has scored more league goals for Liverpool but all of Hodgson's 233 league strikes came in the top-flight from 358 appearances, a fantastic goals-per-game ratio. [...] In total Hodgson scored 295 goals in 467 games in the Football League, 288 of which came in the top-flight from 454 appearances, leaving him fourth in the all-time list of top-flight goalscorers in English football with only Jimmy Greaves (357), Steve Bloomer (317) and Dixie Dean (310) having scored more. [...] Hodgson first came to Liverpool's attention in 1924 as one of the youngest members of the touring South African national team, who on 1 October beat Liverpool 5–2 at Anfield. He joined Liverpool a year later on 14 December 1925, making his debut in a 1–1 draw against Manchester City at Maine Road on 27 February 1926. [...] He opened his goal scoring account eleven days later when he scored twice in a 3–3 draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford on 10 March 1926. [...] He scored the first of a still club record 17 hat-tricks for Liverpool in a 5–1 win against Sheffield United at Anfield on 11 September 1926 in his seventeenth game.|$|E
