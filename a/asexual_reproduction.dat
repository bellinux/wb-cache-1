5|$|Scientists {{say that}} <b>asexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> {{in the wild}} is rare, and {{probably}} a last-ditch effort to reproduce when a mate is not present. <b>Asexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> diminishes genetic diversity, which helps build defenses against threats to the species. Species that rely solely on it risk extinction. <b>Asexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> {{may have contributed to}} the blue shark's decline off the Irish coast.|$|E
5|$|<b>Asexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> {{offers the}} {{benefits}} of high reproductive rate, delaying senescence, and replacement of dead modules, as well as geographical distribution.|$|E
5|$|Methods of {{propagation}} {{include both}} sexual and <b>asexual</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Commercial cultivars are usually sterile.|$|E
50|$|Molecular {{evidence}} {{strongly suggest}} that several species of the stick insect genus Timema have used only <b>asexual</b> (parthenogenetic) <b>reproduction</b> for millions of years, the longest period known for any insect.|$|R
50|$|The {{vegetative}} {{organs are}} essential for maintaining {{the life of a}} plant. While there can be 11 organ systems in animals, there are far fewer in plants, where some perform the vital functions, such as photosynthesis, while the reproductive organs are essential in reproduction. However, if there is <b>asexual</b> vegetative <b>reproduction,</b> the vegetative organs are those that create the new generation of plants (see clonal colony).|$|R
50|$|The {{reproductive}} {{behaviors of}} polykrikoids are mostly not well understood, although P. kofoidii {{has been studied}} and {{found to have a}} complex life cycle of both vegetative (<b>asexual)</b> and sexual <b>reproduction</b> complicated by its pseudocolonial structure.|$|R
5|$|The lack of {{evidence}} of <b>asexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> suggests that the organisms reproduced sexually. Budding or fission has never been observed.|$|E
5|$|For example, in Obelia {{there are}} feeding {{individuals}}, the gastrozooids; the individuals capable of <b>asexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> only, the gonozooids, blastostyles and free-living or sexually reproducing individuals, the medusae.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a 9-year-old female blacktip shark at the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center {{was found}} to be {{pregnant}} with a single near-term female pup, despite having never mated with a male. Genetic analysis confirmed that her offspring was the product of automictic parthenogenesis, a form of <b>asexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> in which an ovum merges with a polar body to form a zygote without fertilization. Along with an earlier case of parthenogenesis in the bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo), this event suggests that <b>asexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> may be more widespread in sharks than previously thought.|$|E
5000|$|Dracs are hermaphrodites and {{reproduce}} {{by way of}} parthenogenesis, an <b>asexual</b> form of <b>reproduction</b> found in females where growth and development of an embryo occurs without fertilization by a male. They {{have no control over}} timing of conception.|$|R
50|$|Piroplasms (order Piroplasmida) are {{eukaryotic}} parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa. They divide by {{binary fission}} and as sporozoan parasites they possess sexual and <b>asexual</b> phases (sexual <b>reproduction</b> {{occurs in the}} tick gut). They include the tick parasites Babesia and Theileria.|$|R
50|$|These ants get the {{benefits}} of both <b>asexual</b> and sexual <b>reproduction</b> - the daughters who can reproduce (the queens) {{have all of the}} mother's genes, while the sterile workers whose physical strength and disease resistance are important are produced sexually.|$|R
5|$|The parasite/host {{relationship}} probably {{drove the}} prevalence of sexual reproduction over the more efficient <b>asexual</b> <b>reproduction.</b> It seems that when a parasite infects a host, sexual reproduction affords {{a better chance of}} developing resistance (through variation in the next generation), giving sexual reproduction variability for fitness not seen in the <b>asexual</b> <b>reproduction,</b> which produces another generation of the organism susceptible to infection by the same parasite. Coevolution between host and parasite may accordingly be responsible for much of the genetic diversity seen in normal populations, including blood-plasma polymorphism, protein polymorphism, and histocompatibility systems.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{in higher}} animals, where {{parthenogenesis}} is rare, <b>asexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> may occur in plants by several different mechanisms. The formation of stem tubers in potato is one example. Particularly in arctic or alpine habitats, where opportunities for fertilisation of flowers by animals are rare, plantlets or bulbs, may develop instead of flowers, replacing sexual reproduction with <b>asexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> and {{giving rise to}} clonal populations genetically identical to the parent. This {{is one of several}} types of apomixis that occur in plants. Apomixis can also happen in a seed, producing a seed that contains an embryo genetically identical to the parent.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other cnidarians, anemones (and other anthozoans) entirely {{lack the}} free-swimming medusal stage of their lifecycle; the polyp {{produces}} eggs and sperm, and the fertilized egg develops into a planula larva which develops directly into another polyp. Both sexual and <b>asexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> can occur.|$|E
5|$|There is no unique {{generally}} accepted {{system at the}} higher taxonomic levels and there are frequent name changes at every level, from species upwards. Efforts among researchers are now underway to establish and encourage usage of a unified and more consistent nomenclature. Fungal species can also have multiple scientific names depending on their life cycle and mode (sexual or <b>asexual)</b> of <b>reproduction.</b> Web sites such as Index Fungorum and ITIS list current names of fungal species (with cross-references to older synonyms).|$|R
50|$|Viviparous plants produce seeds or embryos {{that begin}} to develop before they detach from the parent. Plants such as some Iridaceae and Agavoideae grow cormlets in the axils of their inflorescences, These fall and in {{favourable}} circumstances they have effectively a whole season's start over fallen seeds. Similarly, some Crassulaceae, such as Bryophyllum, develop and drop plantlets from notches in their leaves, ready to grow. Such production of embryos from somatic issues is <b>asexual</b> vegetative <b>reproduction</b> that amounts to cloning.|$|R

5|$|Pygmy sundews: A {{group of}} roughly 40 Australian species, they are {{distinguished}} by miniature growth, {{the formation of}} gemmae for <b>asexual</b> <b>reproduction,</b> and dense formation of hairs in the crown center. These hairs serve to protect the plants from Australia's intense summer sun. Pygmy sundews form the subgenus Bryastrum.|$|E
5|$|Though coral {{have large}} sexually-reproducing populations, their {{evolution}} can be slowed by abundant <b>asexual</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Gene flow is variable among coral species. According to the biogeography of coral species gene flow cannot {{be counted on}} as a dependable source of adaptation as they are very stationary organisms. Also, coral longevity might factor into their adaptivity.|$|E
5|$|All known {{cnidaria}} can reproduce asexually {{by various}} means, {{in addition to}} regenerating after being fragmented. Hydrozoan polyps only bud, while the medusae of some hydrozoans can divide down the middle. Scyphozoan polyps can both bud and split down the middle. In addition to both of these methods, Anthozoa can split horizontally just above the base. <b>Asexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> makes the daughter cnidarian a clone of the adult.|$|E
50|$|As most of {{the other}} species of the genus Daphnia, D. magna reproduces by {{cyclical}} parthenogenesis. This form of reproduction is characterised by the alternating production of <b>asexual</b> offspring (clonal <b>reproduction)</b> and at certain time sexual reproduction through haploid eggs that need to be fertilised.|$|R
50|$|Many {{species can}} use both <b>asexual</b> and sexual <b>reproduction.</b> Most of the triclads are hermaphrodites, the same {{individual}} has {{both male and}} female sexual organs at the same time. In most of the cases the sexual reproduction involve two individuals, autofecundation has been rarely reported (e.g. in Cura foremanii).|$|R
25|$|Conidia are <b>asexual</b> {{reproductive}} (<b>reproduction</b> {{without the}} fusing of gametes) spores of fungi which germinate under specific conditions. A variety of cells can be formed from the germinating conidia. The most common are germ tubes which grow and develop into hyphae. Another type of cell is a conidial anastomosis tube (CAT); these differ from germ tubes {{in that they}} are thinner, shorter, lack branches, exhibit determinate growth and home toward each other. Each cell is of a tubular shape, but the conidial anastomosis tube forms a bridge that allows fusion between conidia.|$|R
5|$|The larvae {{of several}} species of starfish can {{reproduce}} asexually before they reach maturity. They do this by autotomising some parts of their bodies or by budding. When such a larva senses that food is plentiful, it takes the path of <b>asexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> rather than normal development. Though this costs it time and energy and delays maturity, it allows a single larva to give rise to multiple adults when the conditions are appropriate.|$|E
5|$|During evolution, some {{structures}} {{may lose}} their original function and become vestigial structures. Such structures {{may have little}} or no function in a current species, yet have a clear function in ancestral species, or other closely related species. Examples include pseudogenes, the non-functional remains of eyes in blind cave-dwelling fish, wings in flightless birds, the presence of hip bones in whales and snakes, and sexual traits in organisms that reproduce via <b>asexual</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Examples of vestigial structures in humans include wisdom teeth, the coccyx, the vermiform appendix, and other behavioural vestiges such as goose bumps and primitive reflexes.|$|E
5|$|Fungal {{reproduction}} is complex, reflecting {{the differences in}} lifestyles and genetic makeup within this diverse kingdom of organisms. It is estimated {{that a third of}} all fungi reproduce using more than one method of propagation; for example, reproduction may occur in two well-differentiated stages within the life cycle of a species, the teleomorph and the anamorph. Environmental conditions trigger genetically determined developmental states that lead to the creation of specialized structures for sexual or <b>asexual</b> <b>reproduction.</b> These structures aid reproduction by efficiently dispersing spores or spore-containing propagules.|$|E
50|$|B. kewense {{have rarely}} been {{observed}} using egg capsules {{as a primary}} method of <b>reproduction.</b> <b>Asexual</b> fragmentation is its main reproductive strategy in temperate regions and most individuals never develop sexual organs. Juveniles of this species, unlike B. adventitium, do not appear the same coloration as parents in their early days.|$|R
40|$|The pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, has {{a complex}} life cycle that {{alternates}} seasonally between <b>asexual</b> and sexual <b>reproduction.</b> During {{the spring and}} summer months, A. pisum reproduces parthenogenetically, producing clonal daughters for 10 to 20 generations. Fall temperatures and photoperiods induce the production of sexual females and males, which mate to produce overwintering eggs that hatch into asexual females...|$|R
50|$|The {{fruit of}} L. camara is a berry-like drupe which turns from green to dark purple when mature. Both {{vegetative}} (<b>asexual)</b> and seed <b>reproduction</b> occur. Up to 12,000 fruits {{can be produced}} by each plant which are then eaten by birds and other animals which can spread the seeds over large distances, facilitating the spread of L. camara.|$|R
5|$|The {{space between}} the skin and gut is filled with mesenchyme, a {{connective}} tissue made of cells and reinforced by collagen fibers that act {{as a type of}} skeleton, providing attachment points for muscles. The mesenchyme contains all the internal organs and allows the passage of oxygen, nutrients and waste products. It consists of two main types of cell: fixed cells, some of which have fluid-filled vacuoles; and stem cells, which can transform into any other type of cell, and are used in regenerating tissues after injury or <b>asexual</b> <b>reproduction.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{documented}} cases in which a female shark who has not been in contact with a male has conceived a sharklet on her own through parthenogenesis. The details of this process are not well understood, but genetic fingerprinting showed that the sharklets had no paternal genetic contribution, ruling out sperm storage. The extent of this behavior in the wild is unknown, as is whether other species have this capability. Mammals are now the only major vertebrate group in which <b>asexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> has not been observed.|$|E
5|$|Termites {{going through}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis {{on the path}} to becoming alates form a subcaste in certain species of termite, functioning as potential supplementary reproductives. These supplementary reproductives only mature into primary reproductives upon the death of a king or queen, or when the primary reproductives are separated from the colony. Supplementaries have the ability to replace a dead primary reproductive, and there may also be more than a single supplementary within a colony. Some queens have the ability to switch from sexual reproduction to <b>asexual</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Studies show that while termite queens mate with the king to produce colony workers, the queens reproduce their replacements (neotenic queens) parthenogenetically.|$|E
40|$|The embryological features, mode of {{reproduction}} and reproductive capacity (pollen and seed viability) on two naturalized populations of Arnica montana in Bulgaria were studied. The embryological {{study shows that}} A. montana is a facultative apomictic species in which sexual reproduction predominates. In this species, it was established {{that there is a}} comparatively high viability of the mature pollen and embryos, which enables the successful realization of its reproductive capacity. The results of the study on A. montana reveal that both sexual and <b>asexual</b> vegetative <b>reproduction</b> with rhizomes undoubtedly play more important roles than the apomixis (namely diplospory) for support and preservation of the populations...|$|R
2500|$|Koinophilia {{provides}} simple {{explanations for}} the almost universal canalization of sexual creatures into species, the rarity of transitional forms between species (between both extant and fossil species), evolutionary stasis, punctuated equilibria, {{and the evolution of}} cooperation. [...] Koinophilia might also contribute to the maintenance of sexual reproduction, preventing its reversion to the much simpler and inherently more advantageous <b>asexual</b> form of <b>reproduction.</b>|$|R
50|$|Both <b>asexual</b> {{and sexual}} <b>reproduction</b> occur. In the former, cells divide until they form new colonies, {{which are then}} released. In the smaller forms, {{typically}} all cells are involved, but larger forms have anterior vegetative and posterior reproductive cells. Sexual reproduction varies from isogamy (both genders produce flagellated gametes of equal size) to oogamy (one gender produces a much larger, nonmotile gamete).|$|R
