40|$|Extreme rain-storms {{are known}} for {{triggering}} devastating flash floods in various regions of Europe and particularly along the Mediterranean coasts. Despite recent notable advances in weather forecasting, most operational early warning systems for extreme rainstorms and flash floods are based on rainfall estimation, rather than on forecasts. As a result, warning lead times are bounded to few hours and warnings are usually issued when the event is already taking place. This work proposes a novel early warning system for heavy precipitation events in Europe, aimed at detecting extreme rainfall accumulations over short durations and within small-size catchments prone to flash flooding. The system {{is based on the}} recently developed European Precipitation Index based on simulated Climatology (EPIC), which is calculated using COSMO-LEPS ensemble weather forecasts and subsequently fitted with gamma distributions at each time step of the forecast horizon. Probabilistic exceedance of warning thresholds is calculated and <b>alert</b> <b>points</b> are generated whereas potentially extreme events are detected. Comparison of daily runs over 22 months with observed rain-storm events and flash floods in Europe denotes a probability of detection up to 90 %, corresponding to 45 events correctly predicted, with average lead time of 32 hours.

40|$|Cyanobacteria {{in fresh}} water can cause serious threats to {{drinking}} water supplies. Managing cyanobacterial blooms particularly at small drinking water treatment plants is challenging. Because {{large amount of}} cyanobacteria may cause clogging in the treatment process and various cyanotoxins are hard to remove, while they may cause severe health problems. There is lack of instructions of what cyanobacteria/toxin amount should trigger what kind of actions for drinking water management except for Microcystins. This demands a Cyanobacteria Management Tool (CMT) to help regulators/operators to improve cyanobacteria/cyanotoxin monitoring in surface waters for drinking water supply. This project proposes a CMT tool, including selecting proper indicators for quick cyanobacteria monitoring and verifying quick analysis methods for cyanobacteria and cyanotoxin. This tool is suggested for raw water management regarding cyanobacteria monitoring in lakes, especially in boreal forest climate. In addition, it applies to regions that apply international WHO standards for water management. In Swedish context, drinking water producers which use raw water from lakes that experience cyanobacterial blooms, {{need to create a}} monitoring routine for cyanobacteria/cyanotoxin and to monitor beyond such as Anatoxins, Cylindrospermopsins and Saxitoxins. Using the proposed CMT tool will increase water safety at surface water treatment plants substantially by introducing three <b>alerting</b> <b>points</b> for actions.

40|$|Report {{generation}} from coverages around {{points of}} interest (POIs) or in areas of interest (AOIs) is a common need in thematic research projects. The extracted information adds value to the POIs or AOIs dataset by enriching its information content. In a common scenario, POIs or AOIs are usually vector data whereas background thematic datasets are often raster data. The paper investigates different approaches for zonal statistic computation about both raster and vector data with particular focus on server-side free and open source software (FOSS) -based solutions. Extensive performance tests are based on PostGIS (the spatial extension of popular PostgreSQL ([URL] FOSS DBMS) 2. 0. This version {{is the first to}} offer raster support. Previously, vector-raster analysis was not supported by any FOSS DBMS environment and such analyses were possible in a FOSS server-side environment using geographical information system(GIS) tools (e. g., Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) GIS) and Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Processing Server. PostGIS performance data from the tests are compared to an almost standard ESRI ArcGIS desktop approach. A project aimed at monitoring fire alerts in African protected areas provides the benchmarking application. The computation of people living in the surroundings of POIs (<b>alert</b> <b>points</b> from Global Fire Information Management System) based on a world population density dataset (LandScan) is the benchmarking query.

40|$|In this study, we {{experimentally}} {{investigated the}} process leading to fracture in tofu grasping by deformable fingertips {{filled with a}} fluid. In our previous papers [1, 2], we developed deformable fingertips using a rubber bag filled with a viscoelastic fluid, and presented a strategy for delicate tofu grasping without any advance knowledge about fracture. However, the predication point was close to fracture, and the prediction was then still a gamble. In order to realize fracture prediction at an earlier stage, we examined the process leading to fracture when pushing tofu by the deformable fingertips. The stiffness of the fingertips can be controlled with {{the pressure of the}} fluid inside the fingertips. The pushing force and fluid pressure were examined for different levels of stiffness of the fingertips. The main findings and contributions are as follows. 1) The convergence of the ratio of the contact force to fluid pressure gives an indication of dent occurrence. This convergence could be seen when fingertip rubber bag was not filled (low stiffness). 2) It was easier for a dent to occur when the fingertip rubber bag was not filled than when it was filled (high stiffness). 3) Changes in the rate of increase of the fluid pressure as the tofu was pushed were repeatedly observed. We defined this as a phase change and present a method for detecting such changes. The phase change points were detected by comparing the fitting accuracies of different approximation models. 4) The last and second to the last phase changes before fracture were detected by detecting the first phase change (after the convergence of the rate of the contact force to fluid pressure if the fingertip bag was not completely filled).

40|$|Background: Electronic Patient Medication Record (ePMR) {{systems have}} {{important}} safety features embedded to alert users about potential clinical hazards and errors. To date, {{there is no}} synthesis of evidence {{about the effectiveness of}} these safety features and <b>alerts</b> at the <b>point</b> of pharmacy order entry. This review aims to systematically explore the literature and synthesise published evidence about the effectiveness of safety features and alerts in ePMR systems at the point of pharmacy order entry, in primary and secondary care. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Inspec, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, CINHAL (earliest entry to March 2012) and reference lists of articles. Two reviewers examined the titles and abstracts, and used a hierarchical template to identify comparative design studies evaluating the effectiveness of safety features and <b>alerts</b> at the <b>point</b> of pharmacy order entry. The two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the included studies using Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool. Results: Three randomised trials and two before-after studies met our criteria. Four studies involved integrated care facilities and one was hospital-based. The studies were all from the United States (US). The five studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction in medication errors in patients with renal insufficiency, pregnant women dispensed US Food Drug and Administration (FDA) risk category D (evidence of fetal risk but therapeutic benefits can outweigh the risk) or X (evidence suggests that risk to the fetus outweighs therapeutic benefits) medication, first dispensing of inappropriate medications in patients aged 65 and above, co-dispensing of interacting drugs, and adverse drug events related to hyperkalaemia. Conclusions: This systematic review shows that the safety features of ePMR systems are effective in alerting users about potential clinical hazards and errors during pharmacy order entry. There are however, problems such as false alerts and inconsistencies in alert management. More studies are needed from other countries and pharmacy practice settings to assess the effectiveness of electronic safety features and alerts in preventing error and reducing harm to patients...|$|R

Relative contribution of each component of our approach. From the results, the tracking system, originally designed for outdoors scenes, appears to be the weak component in our system. We need to improve the background/foreground segmentation in order to produce less fragmented objects. Also, we don’t have a pedestrian or upper-body detector available this year (it is planned for next year however) so we are tracking many foreground objects that are not pertinent.

Results were not up to our expectations mainly because our object tracker is not performing well enough. For the ObjectPut task, we were looking for a fast and low level approach that could detect static objects appearing in the image foreground. It produced results beyond our expectations. The approach, however, is not able to separate static persons versus real static objects leading to a high number of false alarms.

A misplaced phone call <b>alerts</b> Front <b>Point</b> hedge fund manager Mark Baum (Steve Carell) to his plans, and he is convinced to buy credit default swaps from Vennett due to his own personal distaste with the banks. Vennett explains that the market collapse is being further perpetuated by the packaging of subprime loans into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) large enough to be considered AAA ratings. Baum sends staff to investigate the Miami housing market and they discover that mortgage brokers are making money by selling risky mortgages to the Wall Street banks, which created the bubble. In early 2007, these loans begin to default, but the prices of the CDOs somehow rise. Meanwhile, ratings agencies refuse to downgrade the ratings of these failing bonds. When Baum questions an acquaintance at Standard & Poor's, he discovers conflicts of interest and dishonesty amongst the credit rating agencies. When Baum's employees question Vennett's motives, he maintains his position and invites Baum and his team to the American Securitization Forum in Las Vegas. Baum interviews CDO manager Wing Chau, who creates CDOs on behalf of an investment bank, claiming to represent the interests of investors. Chau describes how synthetic CDOs make a chain of increasingly large bets on the faulty loans, involving up to 20 times as much money as the loans themselves. Baum horrifyingly realizes that the fraud will completely collapse the global economy and decides to purchase as many swaps as possible, profiting from the situation at the banks' expense. Waiting until the last minute to sell their position, Baum's fund makes a profit of $1 billion, but he laments that the banks won't accept blame for the crisis.|$|R
