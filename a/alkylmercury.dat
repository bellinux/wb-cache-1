However, it is not necessarily the treatment of choice for toxicity to these metals. Dimercaprol has been used as an adjunct in the treatment of the acute encephalopathy of lead toxicity. It is a potentially toxic drug, and its use may be accompanied by multiple side effects. Although treatment with dimercaprol will increase the excretion of cadmium, there is a concomitant increase in renal cadmium concentration, so that its use in case of cadmium toxicity is to be avoided.

40|$|A new {{free radical}} chain process of alkyl radical {{additions}} to olefins has been discovered. The alkyl radical addition is {{initiated by the}} reaction of <b>alkylmercury</b> halides with silyl hydrides such as triethylsilane or phenylsilane. The process occurs at room temperature and gives satisfactory results only with dimethyl sulfoxide as solvent. This procedure produces regioselectively the reductive alkylation products in good yield {{for a wide variety}} of substituted olefins. The mechanism of this new process has been established through kinetic studies and product analysis. Experimental results have suggested that the reaction is a free radical chain process with the <b>alkylmercury</b> hydride as an intermediate. The <b>alkylmercury</b> hydride is formed slowly by the reaction of <b>alkylmercury</b> halide with a silyl hydride compound in dimethyl sulfoxide. The reaction of the silyl halide, which is formed from the atom exchange, with dimethyl sulfoxide is the driving force for the <b>alkylmercury</b> hydride formation. The <b>alkylmercury</b> hydride acts as the chain carrier as well as initiator for the reaction by providing alkyl radicals from decomposition;By using this new reaction procedure, the relative reactivities of a wide variety of substituted olefins have been measured by competition studies. The relative reactivity study suggests that the free radical alkylation of olefins is nucleophilic in character with an early transition state in a kinetically controlled process;A mechanistic study has also been carried out for the demercuration of 3, 3 -diacetylpropylmercuric chloride. 3, 3 -Diacetylpropylmercuric chloride showed unusual reactivity towards base to form 1, 1 -diacetylcyclopropane. The cyclization reaction is completely inhibited by the presence of diphenyl disulfide. Evidence is presented that the cyclization reaction proceeds by a nucleophilic substitution mechanism.

40|$|New {{free radical}} chain alklations of [alpha],[beta]-unsaturated {{carbonyl}} compounds with <b>alkylmercury</b> halides have been discovered. Although educt radicals of the enolyl type are unreactive towards <b>alkylmercury</b> halides, chain propagating reactions invovling electron transfer can be {{promoted by the}} presence of bases or iodide ion to yield respectively the oxidative (substitutive) and reductive (additive) alkylation products. In the presence of 1, 4 -diazabicyclo(2. 2. 2) octane the intermediate enolyl radical formed by the addition of a free radical to a 1, 4 -enedione can be deprotonated to a radical anion which yields the oxidative alkylation product upon electron transfer to <b>alkylmercury</b> halide. The electron transfer process regenerates the chain propagating alkyl radical. For the reductive alkylation, I[superscript]- or I[superscript]-/S[subscript] 2 O[subscript] 8 [superscript] 2 - promotes the photostimulated reductive alkylation of [alpha],[beta]-unsaturated carbonyls or 1, 4 -enediones. The effectiveness of alkylmercurials in the enolyl to enolate conversion decreases in the sequence of t-BuHgI/I[superscript]- ≥ BuHgCl/I[superscript]- 3 ̆e t-BuHgI 3 ̆e t-BuHgCl. The measured initial kinetic chain length for the reaction of t-BuHgI with N-methylmaleimide to give 3 -(1, 1 -dimethylethyl) - 1 -methyl- 2, 5 -pyrrolidinedione is 200. The relative reactivities of [alpha],[beta]-unsaturated carbonyls, 1, 4 -enediones, [alpha],[beta]-unsaturated nitriles, imines, N-but- 3 -enyl-N-methylaminobenzene, and the benzene ring of the benzoyl group towards tert-butyl radical addition have been determined in competitive reactions. In the presence of para-toluenesulfonic acid or trimethylsilyl iodide the reactivity of imines is enhanced towards tert-butyl radical addition. Substitution reaction of aromatic compounds which have an electron-withdrawing group, such as benzaldehyde, produces exclusively the para-alkylation product via addition of the tert-butyl free radical. Radical cyclization is observed with 1 -phenyl- 4 -penten- 1 -one and N-but- 3 -enyl-N-methylaminobenzene which is initiated by radical addition to the terminal alkene position followed by cyclization with the aromatic ring...|$|E

The method involves eluting mercury species from the soil/sediment samples using 5 M HCl containing 5 mM Pd 2 + and 0. 1 M Cu 2 + and then extracting MeHg+ and EtHg+ into toluene as chlorides. These <b>alkylmercury</b> chlorides are then back-extracted into an aqueous EDTA solution, creating EDTA complexes. Finally, an emetine-dithiocarbamate (emetineCS 2) solution {{is added to}} the EDTA solution to form emetineCS 2 –alkylmercury complexes.

The MeHg+ and EtHg+ calibration curves, using the peak height, were linear from 0. 5 to 20 ng (as Hg). The detection limit was 0. 16 ng/g (analyzing 1 g soil or sediment). The procedure was validated by analyzing a certified reference material (ERM CC 580, estuarine sediment). The MeHg+ concentration determined using the proposed method was in good agreement with the certified value, and EtHg+ was detected in the reference material.

The results were compared with those obtained from a similar rural area from which few cases had been reported. A questionnaire was used to determine the amount of contaminated bread eaten and the frequency of symptoms; a simple clinical examination was performed and blood and hair samples were collected for estimation of total mercury concentration. Of 700 people over the age of 5 years in the high-exposure area, 66 % admitted to having eaten contaminated bread, while none of the 864 persons in the low exposure area had done so.

40|$|Free radical chain {{reactions}} of imines and iminium salts with tert-butylmercury halides give reductive alkylation products.

40|$|This report {{reviews the}} recent {{literature}} on the adverse effects of occupational factors on fertility and related reproductive outcomes. Few studies fulfill the criteria of good study design because of small sample size, insensitive measures of effect, selection, recall, and observation bias, weak if any control of confounding factors, bad definition of exposure, inability to analyze a dose-response relationship, and inadequate statistical analysis. The high prevalence of unsuccessful reproductive outcomes {{in the general population}} makes the design of human fertility studies difficult. Although a number of publications indicate that certain occupational factors and settings adversely affect both male and female fertility, {{it is virtually impossible to}} estimate the proportion of infertility due to occupational factors in the general population. The collected data suggest that the exposure to the following substances or occupational settings may affect a function of male genital system, leading to sperm abnormalities, hyperestrogenism, impotence, infertility, and/or increased spontaneous abortion rate in wives of exposed workers: <b>alkylmercury,</b> antimonide, anesthetic gases, boron, carbon disulfide, chlorodecone, chloroprene, some carbamates (carbaryl), diaminostilbene, 1, 2 -dibromo- 3 -chloropropane, ethylene glycol ethers, ethylene dibromide, inorganic lead, manganese, methyl chloride, organic solvents, synthetic estrogens and progestins, tetraethyllead, combined exposure to styrene and acetone, welding operations, and heat.
