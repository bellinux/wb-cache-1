60|$|She turned <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> band of courtiers {{who stood}} silently around her throne.|$|E
60|$|He {{breathed a}} deep breath <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room before his gaze fixed again on Duane.|$|E
60|$|Ithobal seated himself <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> hall. Presently {{his glance}} fell upon Aziel, and he scowled.|$|E
60|$|She laughed softly, {{leaning back}} amongst the {{cushions}} of <b>the</b> chair <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room, her kindly {{eyes filled with}} interest.|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way," [...] cried Peterkin, {{starting}} up <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> spot on which his interesting tete-a-tete had taken place, [...] "where is the frog? It was just here that--Ah!--oh!--oh! poor, poor frog! ...|$|R
60|$|Kim {{cleared his}} throat <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> at <b>the</b> village greybeards.|$|R
60|$|Jim {{breathed a}} deep breath <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room before his gaze fixed again on mine.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{drew back}} <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room, {{and the sight}} of the {{assembled}} company quite amazed him.|$|E
60|$|I {{turned the}} lamp {{a little higher}} <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around.</b> <b>The</b> room was quite a small one and plainly {{furnished}} as a waiting-room.|$|E
5000|$|Apparently {{marriage}} did {{not change}} Antoine's womanizing ways. Rebecca West (with whom he had a short affair in 1927) called him [...] "a boudoir athlete". While attending {{a party at the}} French embassy in London <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room, West realized that every woman in attendance had been his mistress at one time or another.|$|R
60|$|She shrugged her {{shoulders}} <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> disparagingly <b>around</b> <b>the</b> plainly furnished man's sitting room.|$|R
60|$|The Countess {{turned her}} eyes to the King as she spoke, with a look which was {{probably}} intended as a reproach, but the breast of Louis was armed against all such artillery. On the contrary, waving slowly his expanded hands, <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> circle, he seemed to make a triumphant appeal to all present, upon the testimony borne to his innocence in the Countess's reply.|$|R
6000|$|... "A merry maiden went to sea-- [...] Sing too-ral-oo-ral-i-do! [...] She sat {{upon the}} Captain's knee [...] <b>And</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> sea to see [...] What she could see, but she couldn't see me-- [...] Sing too-ral-oo-ral-i-do! ...|$|E
60|$|There was no especial {{anxiety in}} his tones, which were slow and {{distinct}} and a trifle sharp. He seemed {{ill at ease}} <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> foyer again, as if fearing he had entered the wrong place.|$|E
60|$|He reeled {{out of the}} room. Anna was {{afterwards}} {{astonished at}} her own self-possession. She bound a scarf tightly round {{the place where the}} blood seemed to be coming from. Then she stood up <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room.|$|E
60|$|Wampole had not {{yet seen}} him, but he heard the youthâ€™s voice <b>and</b> now <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> edge of the paper.|$|R
60|$|Again {{the waiter}} {{paused for a}} moment before he answered--paused <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> nervously <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room. His voice shook.|$|R
60|$|Lord Arranmore {{lifted a}} glass of {{champagne}} to the level of his head <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> thoughtfully <b>around</b> <b>the</b> table.|$|R
60|$|The birds came {{sweeping}} {{into the}} Valley at daybreak, and their songs, so seldom {{heard in the}} deep wood, aroused the stranger. He rubbed the web of sleep from his eyelids <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around.</b> <b>The</b> house met his gaze.|$|E
60|$|He {{helped me}} to stagger to my feet, and pushed me gently into the easy chair. The match burnt out, and he quietly struck another <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room for a candle or lamp. It was a vain search, for I had neither.|$|E
60|$|The fellow sat up <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around.</b> <b>The</b> {{blood was}} {{streaming}} {{from his nose}} and from a wound in his head. He had a savage and hunted look. He was unsubdued, but was too much dazed {{to be able to}} do anything more than swear at them all.|$|E

50|$|Some days later, {{the late}} Mahaswami Sri Chandrashekarendra Saraswati {{happened}} to visit. Aanjaneya Ammal shared her dream with the Swamigal. The Swamigal immediately asked <b>the</b> people <b>around</b> {{him to go}} <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> area of the current temple. The men went as advised and to their surprise found the idols lying there on the ground. Later with Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams funding, the temple was constructed as per standard specifications.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} begins with Rain {{in a room}} with a light {{representing}} the sun rising. Then he is shown coming down a helicopter with wings <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>around.</b> <b>The</b> atmosphere suggests a war has just happened so he has a very pained face. The scene changes and he is walking to a clearing in the wreckage without wings and soldiers are coming out of the rubble. The rest is a dance interlude.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew it was}} the doctor," [...] she said, [...] "for I {{went out}} <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> corner of the house, and saw his horse. But I do not see why we should give up our trick. Let us play it on the doctor as well as on your brother." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{pedestrian}} stood up, apparently with revived determination, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around.</b> <b>The</b> road {{appeared to}} be familiar to her, and she carefully scanned the fence as she slowly walked along. Presently there became visible a dim white shape; it was another milestone. She drew her fingers across its face to feel the marks.|$|E
60|$|When {{the boys}} awoke, {{the sun was}} shining brightly. Shep was the first to rouse up and he slipped outside <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{clearing}} and on to the lake. Not a person or a creature was in sight. He stirred up the fire and piled on some wood and then began to wash up.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{figure out}} this thing," [...] he mused. [...] "It {{seems to me}} that whoever those strangers were they haven't been near the house, and it's a quiet country, anyway." [...] He glanced down at his bare feet. [...] "I'd go along <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> barn <b>and</b> stables only that I'd {{certainly}} stub my toes, and it wouldn't be any use. Nobody steals horses around here. They couldn't get rid of them if they did." ...|$|R
60|$|An old {{shepherd}} presently {{entered the}} hut {{from the direction}} of <b>the</b> ewes, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> in <b>the</b> gloom. 'Be ye sleepy?' he asked in cross accents of the boy.|$|R
6000|$|I stood {{upon the}} {{platform}} {{of the little}} deserted railway station of <b>the</b> frontier <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> at <b>the</b> wide prospect. [...] "So this," [...] I said to myself, [...] "is Mexico!" ...|$|R
60|$|A mob of excited people marked {{its site}} by {{loitering}} about the door. Two policemen held off the angrier spirits among the shareholders. But, nothing daunted by the press, Guy forced {{his way in}} <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room trembling, for Montague Nevitt. Too late! Too late! Nevitt wasn't there. The unhappy dupe turned to the clerk in charge.|$|E
60|$|He {{followed}} her to a tiny round table, and sat down by her side upon the cushioned seat. As he gave his order <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> little room, he smiled gravely to himself. It {{was the first time}} in his life,--at any rate since his boyhood,--that he had taken a woman into a public room. Decidedly it was a new era for him.|$|E
60|$|Newman {{assured her}} that he suspected, {{if he had not}} measured, his {{domestic}} abuses, and that to reform them was a mission worthy of her powers. She held her candlestick aloft again <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> salon with compassionate glances; then she intimated that she accepted the mission, and that its sacred character would sustain her in her rupture with Madame de Bellegarde. With this she curtsied herself away.|$|E
60|$|While they waited, the Tin Woodman went to {{the door}} of the {{workshop}} and, finding it unlocked, entered <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> curiously <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room where he had been made.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I've {{just laid}} an egg, that's all," [...] replied a small, but sharp and {{distinct}} voice, <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> her <b>the</b> little girl discovered a yellow hen squatting {{in the opposite}} corner of the coop.|$|R
60|$|Joe saw the Indian guard {{leaning against}} a tree, asleep. Silvertip was gone. The captive raised his head <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> for <b>the</b> chief. There were only four Indians left, three {{on the ground and}} one against the tree.|$|R
