40|$|How is it {{possible}} that we can tell whether someone is from New York City or Texas or Minnesota simply by listening to their speech? The fact that ordinary people have no trouble with this task is a minor miracle! Sociolinguists and dialectologists have ignored the ability of naïve listeners to distinguish one dialect from another and to attach them to a specific geographical region. Recent work done by Clopper (2004), Preston (1999), and Thomas (2002), has begun to address the role of perception in dialect recognition, synthesizing techniques from phonetics, psychology, and even forensics. The New Integrated Perceptual Sociolinguistics (IPS) research indicates that naïve listeners accumulate knowledge <b>about</b> <b>language</b> <b>variation</b> and are able to apply this knowledge to wide variety of tasks relating to dialect perception. This paper reviews these studies and other previous research in perceptual dialectology and sociophonetic work, and discusses their experimental methodologies. Using this information as background, I designed a pilot experiment involving dialect perception by naïve listeners. The goal {{of this paper is to}} investigate naïve intuitive knowledge of dialects from a perceptual perspective in the hopes of scrutinizing our instinctive knowledge <b>about</b> <b>language</b> <b>variation...</b>|$|E

Variously termed ‘hedges’, ‘fumbles’ and ‘conversational greasers’ in earlier academic studies, this book explores the meaning, function and role of well, I mean, just, sort of, like and you know in British English. Adopting a sociolinguistic and historical perspective, Beeching investigates how these six commonly occurring pragmatic markers are used {{and the ways in}} which their current meanings and functions have evolved.

By focusing on how local and global participants both individuals and institutions imagine language variation through disparate framings of neutral and standard, it highlights how processes of globalization and localization are interconnected, dialogic, and symbiotic. Compared are (i) sociolinguistic constructions of Indian cartoon characters, (ii) American accent training institutes, (iii) Indian call center and language improvement books, (iv) American speakers interpretations of merged IE speech, and, (v) IE speakers attitudes about IE, neutral, and standard language.

40|$|For {{a couple}} of decades now, in Flanders, the {{functional}} elaboration of what is generally called tussentaal, i. e. mesolectal language use situated in between (‘tussen’) acrolectal Standard Dutch and basilectal Flemish dialects, has caused increasing concern about the position of Standard Dutch relative to other recognized ways of speaking. This has provoked intense debate about the proper characterization of this evolution. This paper focuses on the daily language practices and overt attitudes of six girls at a Flemish secondary school to illustrate that it is relatively easy to find evidence that suggests this evolution is properly characterized as a type of destandardization. Yet by zooming in on the covert SLI-influenced language attitudes of the girls, I will argue that a close ethnographic study of daily language use is able to go beyond the surface appearances of larger-scale ideologies and can demonstrate the continuing influence of standardization. Sociolinguistic ethnography may therefore have a vital role to play in the ongoing debate <b>about</b> <b>language</b> <b>variation</b> in Flanders...|$|E

Computational modeling of neural networks appears to be a good match for analysis of language data, and can offer clues about neural function.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an exhaustive research about ongoing language variation {{and change in}} the Japanese voice system. Through the analysis I identify the roles of internal and external factors in human linguistic competence that govern the language variation and change, and I construct a model of grammar that inherently includes the language variation and change. This work aims at the formal theoretical analysis primarily built upon the empirical evidence: {{a huge amount of}} spontaneous speech data. Until now, a number of researches on language variation and change have been done from various perspectives: The sociolinguistic research, specifically {{from the perspective of the}} variationist approach (Labov 1963 et seq., Weinreich et al. 1968), has revealed much <b>about</b> <b>language</b> <b>variation</b> and change, particularly with respect to phonological aspects, focusing on various internal and external factors that govern the phenomena by the quantitative method. However, the formalization of the mechanism of language variation and change is insufficient; the generative grammatical approach (Chomsky 1957) can give a formal account of the phenomena based on the grammatica...|$|E
40|$|To {{the extent}} that {{syntactic}} theory {{is concerned with the}} search for a suitably restrictive grammar formalism — one whose generative capacity is the class of natural languages, and where the grammars of languages belonging to statistically common types are less ’marked’ than those of languages belonging to statistically uncommon types — the combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) formalism of Steedman (2000) represents a promising starting point for investigations. CCG is powerful enough to capture what formal linguists agree are the most complex syntactic phenomena found in natural languages (e. g. the cross-serial dependencies in Dutch subordinate clauses), but not so powerful that formally conceivable but empirically unattested dependencies can be generated (e. g. unbounded long distance scrambling). In addition, CCG predicts certain correlations among distinct parameters of language variation which are supported by data from typological studies (e. g. the observation of Ross (1970) that VSO languages are generally right-gapping languages whilst SOV languages are generally left-gapping). However, there are some well-known generalisations <b>about</b> <b>language</b> <b>variation</b> which CCG gets wrong. One example concerns the Greenbergian universals which state that: (a) V...|$|E

However, it is possible to conclude that, despite similarities, there are deviations restricted to written production by students from rural areas, due to the transposition of marks stigmatized by rural dialect.

Through variability studies, answers can be found to questions about how to delimit styles, how to effect acceptability in school writing and talking, how to appreciate the dynamics of variation in the language of others, how to sequence language materials, how people set themselves off from each other through language, or how subtle variation between spoken and written language forms can cause problems in composition and reading. Information <b>about</b> <b>language</b> <b>variation</b> may be used to help rethink the education of teachers, the development of instructional materials and techniques, and the building of educational programs of various sorts. Linguists must try to gain influence within the field of education if they want to participate in effective educational planning. Three plans are suggested by which linguists can work for change from within the existing education system; (1) infiltration, (2) the jealousy motif, and (3) management control. The study of variation will also help to broaden the training programs of linguistics students, thereby providing them with more versatility as they approach the job market.

The research subject of this study is the broadcaster who uses code mixing during his/her broadcasting in Indonesia Request and Request Time in EBS FM Surabaya. In this study, the data collections are recording the broadcaster’s language during request programs from beginning until the end of these programs for five times recording and interviewing the broadcaster of request programs. Data analysis of this study is identifying and classifying the form of code mixings. There are three forms of code mixing used by the broadcasters of request programs in EBS FM radio station. They are code mixing in word, code mixing in phrase and code mixing in sentence. The broadcaster uses code mixing in saying the jargon of radio station, in saying the leave-taking greeting to the listener, in making interaction with the listener and in reading the short messages services (sms) from the participant. The purposes of using code mixing are to get comfort feeling, especially, the broadcaster who broadcast Request Time, the request program for west music only, to attract the listener, to emphasize the knowledge and to describe an object for which there is no obvious word available in one language...|$|E

This study concerns many aspects of social and language variation such as address term, code switching, kinship system. The study under report deals with the connection of two aspects namely : address term and kinship system. In details, {{the topic of the}} study is the Balinese and Javanese address terms in addressing uncle and aunt. This topic was chosen based on the reason {{that there is a need}} for further investigation <b>about</b> <b>language</b> <b>variation</b> between different cultures to avoid misunderstanding. Based on the background, the study was done to answer the major question : "what are the differences and similarities that Balinese and Javanese use in addressing their uncle and aunt ?". This major problem was answered by answering the minor questions : (a) what address terms do the Balinese and Javanese use to address their uncle and aunt, and (b) what are the underlying reasons and social factors the Balinese and Javanese have. In line with the research questions, the objectives of the study are to : (a) find out the address term used by Balinese and Javanese, (b) find out the underlying reasons and social factors and (c) find out the differences and similarities of Balinese and Javanese address terms. The study is a qualitative study since it deals with the subjective description of the researcher, it has natural setting, and it involves the researcher in the observation. Also the data were analyzed inductively. The participants of the study are Balinese, from each caste and Javanese living around Bali and Surabaya. The data of the study were obtained from the recorded interview between the participants and the researcher. The findings of the study showed that there are many various terms used by Balinese to address their uncle. The terms are : Pak, Wo, Aji (for Brahmin), Aji, Ajung, Ji, Jung (for Kshatriya), Bapa, Aji (for Vaisya) and Bapa, Pak, Om (for Shudra). Whereas the terms used to address aunt are Wo, Biyang, Biyang Klu (for Brahmin), Wo, Wo Agung, Gung Wo, Wo Ratu, Ajung, Ibu, Bujung (for Kshatriya), Wo (for Brahmin) and Bibi, bi, Wo, Tante (for Shudra). The terms that are used by Javanese are Pakde, Pakpuh, Wak Gus, Paklik, Om, Paman to address uncle and Bupuh, Bude, Wakyu, Mbok De, Bulik, Tante to address their aunt. The reasons of using the terms also vary. The Balinese said that they want to show their social caste, familiarity, respect. While Javanese said that they are not influenced by social caste but they also want to show respect and familiarity. From the data analyzed, it is known that there are some similarities and differences. The similarities are : the Balinese and Javanese address terms have neutral terms, i. e om and tante; differentiate the addressee's position and are used to show respect and familiarity. The differences are Balinese address terms are followed by name, show social status, and can be used by both gender. These things cannot be found on Javanese. The findings show that the actually the Balinese and Javanese address terms are almost the same in the form and reason to use although there are still some differences.
