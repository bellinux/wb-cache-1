40|$|Although many {{patients}} with epilepsy achieve {{control of their}} seizures with medication, a substantial number ultimately develop intractable epilepsy. Patients with intractable epilepsy form the group for whom surgical procedures may be beneficial. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical profile and outcome of 141 patients operated for intractable epilepsy at Vellore between 1949 and 1990. The operative procedures done for suprasylvian epilepsy were topectomy (24 cases) and lobectomy (2 cases). For temporal lobe epilepsy the surgical procedures done were topectomy (28 cases), temporal lobectomy with <b>amygdalectomy</b> (25 cases), temporal lobectomy with <b>amygdalectomy</b> and hippocampectomy (10 cases), <b>amygdalectomy</b> (15 cases) and topectomy with <b>amygdalectomy</b> in one case. Hemispherectomy was done for 12 cases with multilobe epilepsy. For multifocal epilepsy, four patients underwent stereotactic ansotomy. Post operative complications included infections (10 cases) and acute post operative haematoma in one patient. There was transient neurological deterioration in ten patients. Three patients operated prior to 1960 died due to peri operative complications. Follow up data of 80 patients, ranging from 1 to 42 years (mean 10 years) was analysed. Total or near total seizure control was obtained in 53 &#x 0025; patients and a worthwhile outcome in 20 &#x 0025; patients. Mental retardation, pre operative scalp electroencephalography and post excision electrocorticography {{has been shown to}} be predictors of outcome with respect to seizures...|$|E
40|$|The {{reinforcing}} {{strengths of}} foods were assessed in rhesus monkeys {{before and after}} bilateral radio-frequency lesions of the lateral amygdala (n = 4), basolateral amygdala (n = 4), and total amygdala (n = 3). None of these lesions altered preoperative preferences between three highly palatable foods. Moreover, the lesions had no discernible effect on the animals' responses to different food rewards as measured by a progressive ratio schedule, although performance on this schedule proved sensitive to the size and type of food reward and {{to the degree of}} deprivation. The results suggest that <b>amygdalectomy</b> leaves a normal appreciation of at least this one class of rewards, foods. The dietary changes typically seen after <b>amygdalectomy,</b> such as meat eating, which were also observed in the same animals, probably reflect a loss of neophobia...|$|E
40|$|Performance on {{a visual}} {{recognition}} task was assessed in cynomolgus monkeys with ablations of rhinal (i. e., ento-, pro-, and perirhinal) cortex {{in combination with}} either <b>amygdalectomy</b> or hippocampectomy, {{as well as in}} unoperated controls. Removal of the hippocampal formation plus rhinal cortex resulted in a mild recognition deficit, whereas removal of the amygdaloid complex plus rhinal cortex resulted in a severe deficit. Comparison of the results with those of an earlier study (Mishkin, 1978) indicates that adding a rhinal cortical removal to hippocampectomy yields little, if any, additional impairment in recognition. By confrasf, adding a rhinal cortical removal to an <b>amygdalectomy</b> has a profound effect; indeed, the recognition impairment in monkeys with amygdaloid plus rhinal removals was at least as severe as that seen in monkeys with combined amygdaloid and hippocampal removals. Taken together, these results suppor...|$|E
40|$|Four emotionally arousing stimuli {{were used}} to probe the {{behavior}} of monkeys with bilateral ablations of the entorhinal and perirhinal cortex. The animals' behavioral changes were then contrasted with those observed earlier (Meunier et al., 1999) in monkeys with either neurotoxic or aspiration lesions of the neighboring amygdala. Rhinal cortex ablations yielded several subtle behavioral changes, {{but none of them}} resembled any of the disorders typically seen after <b>amygdalectomies.</b> The changes produced by rhinal damage took mainly the form of heightened defensiveness, and attenuated submission and approach responses, that is, just the opposite {{of some of the most}} distinctive symptoms following amygdala damage. These findings raise the possibility that the rhinal cortex and amygdala have distinct, interactive, functions in normal behavioral adaptation to affective stimuli...|$|R
40|$|The amygdala, {{which plays}} a {{critical}} role in emotional learning and social cognition, is structurally and functionally sexually dimorphic in humans. We used magnetic neuroimaging and molecular genetic analyses with healthy subjects and patients possessing X-chromosome anomalies to find dosage-sensitive genes that might influence amygdala development. If such X-linked genes lacked a homologue on the Y-chromosome they would be expressed in one copy in normal 46,XY males and two copies in normal 46,XX females. We showed by means of magnetic neuroimaging that 46,XY males possess significantly increased amygdala volumes relative to normal 46,XX females. However, females with Turner syndrome (45,X) have even larger amygdalae than 46,XY males. This finding implies that haploinsufficiency for one or more X-linked genes influences amygdala development irrespective of a direct or indirect (endocrinological) mechanism involving the Y-chromosome. 45,X females also have increased grey matter volume in the orbitofrontal cortex bilaterally, close to a region implicated in emotional learning. They are as poor as patients with bilateral <b>amygdalectomies</b> in the recognition of fear from facial expressions. We attempted to localize the gene(s) responsible for these deficits in X-monosomy by means of a deletion mapping strategy. We studied female patients possessing structural X-anomalies of the short arm. A genetic locus (no greater than 4. 96 Mb in size) at Xp 11. 3 appears to {{play a key role in}} amygdala and orbitofrontal structural and (by implication) functional development. Females with partial X-chromosome deletions, in whom this critical locus is deleted, have normal intelligence. Their fear recognition is as poor as that of 45,X females and their amygdalae are correspondingly enlarged. This 4. 96 Mb region contains, among others, the genes for monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and B (MAOB), which are involved in the oxidative deamination of several neurotransmitters, including dopamine and serotonin. Abnormal activity of these neurotransmitters has been implicated in the aetiology of several neurodevelopmental disorders in which social cognitive deficits are prominent. These associated deficits include a specific lack of fear recognition from facial expressions. We show that the thrombocytic activity of MAOB is proportionate to the number of X-chromosomes, and hypothesize that haploinsufficiency of this enzyme in 45,X females predisposes to their deficits in social cognition...|$|R
40|$|Three Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) {{took part}} in an {{experiment}} on visual learning set in an automatic apparatus. Each new visual discrimination problem was solved using a visual secondary reinforcer consisting of a white line. If the monkey chose the correct stimulus (by touching it), the white line appeared over the correct stimulus. Primary food reward was delivered only after a new problem was solved to a criterion, and the problem was then replaced by a new one. Thus, within-problem learning did not rely on primary reinforcement but on the visual secondary reinforcer. The animals were trained preoperatively in visual learning set with this procedure and were assessed postoperatively {{for their ability to}} learn new visual discriminations with the same procedure. Bilateral <b>amygdalectomy</b> did not significantly impair the animals' learning ability in this task. Learning remained unimpaired when transection of the uncinate fascicle and of the fornix was added to <b>amygdalectomy.</b> The effect of bilateral <b>amygdalectomy</b> in this task was much less severe than in a similar task we previously studied, with auditory secondary reinforcers. The results show that the involvement of the amygdala in processes of secondary reinforcement depends on the sensory properties of the secondary reinforcer. From these and other recent results, we conclude that the sensory attributes of a reinforcer are easily associated with a discriminative stimulus when they are in the same modality and same spatial location as the discriminative stimulus and that this sensory-sensory association is independent of the amygdala...|$|E
40|$|Behavioral {{effects of}} {{subtotal}} amygdaloid lesions were investigated {{in an attempt}} to dissociate some of the abnormalities seen after total <b>amygdalectomy.</b> Twelve monkeys received bilateral stereotaxic lesions centered in the basolateral amygdala, lateral amygdala, dorsal amygdala, or the temporal white matter lying adjacent to the lateral amygdala. These monkeys were compared with others with control operations. The control monkeys then received total amygdaloid lesions (AMX). The AMX monkeys exhibited the typical amygdaloid syndrome of hypoemotionality, meat eating, coprophagia, and excessive exploration. In contrast, the monkeys with subtotal amygdaloid lesions would not eat meat or feces, though they were more willing than control monkeys to investigate inanimate objects. Although minor changes in affect were observed, the extreme emotional changes seen after total <b>amygdalectomy</b> were found only in the monkey with the largest subtotal lesion. Only those animals that were hypoemotional showed a deficit in learning successive reversals of an object discrimination. This close association suggests that both the hypoemotionality and the successive reversal deficit arise from the same underlying dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|Nine monkeys in 3 groups {{took part}} in an {{experiment}} on visual discrimination learning set in an automatic apparatus. Each new visual discrimination problem was solved using auditory secondary reinforcers. Primary food reinforcement was delivered only after a new problem had been solved to a criterion, and the problem was then replaced by a new one; thus, within-problem learning relied purely on secondary and not on primary reinforcement, but the secondary reinforcers were associated with primary reinforcement. Bilateral <b>amygdalectomy</b> severely retarded within-problem learning. Disconnection of the amygdala from auditory input, by crossed unilateral lesions of amygdala and of auditory cortex combined with forebrain commissurotomy, had a similar effect to that of bilateral <b>amygdalectomy.</b> Disconnection of the amygdala from visual association cortex left learning unimpaired. Thus, for normal performance in this task, interaction of the amygdala with the sensory modality of the secondary reinforcer was essential, but interaction of the amygdala with the sensory modality of the discriminative stimuli was not necessary. It was concluded that the amygdala is involved in associating stimuli with the primary reinforcing attributes of food reward, and not with its other attributes...|$|E
40|$|Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) {{with either}} {{bilateral}} <b>amygdalectomy</b> or bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortical ablations showed abnormal choices between apple, lemon, olive, and meat. Not {{only did they}} choose meat or olive more often than normal animals, but also their choices were less consistent from trial to trial than the normal animals' choices were. The same animals were subsequently tested {{for their ability to}} learn 2 -choice simultaneous visual discriminations between objects which they could suck. The positive object yielded fruit juice, which entered the mouth directly without being seen. Both groups of animals with lesions were severely impaired in this discrimination learning task. The reason why <b>amygdalectomy</b> has little effect on simple object discrimination learning in the Wisconsin General Test Apparatus, we suggest, is that the animal can there associate the visual discriminanda with the visual properties of the food reward, a mechanism which is not available when the reward is unseen. These results add to existing evidence of a close functional relationship between the amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and they support the proposal, derived from previous work, that the amygdala is important for associating visual stimuli with the incentive value of reinforcers...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} whether medial temporal limbic structures {{are essential for}} memory {{in more than one}} modality, we trained monkeys preoperatively on both visual and tactual versions of a sensory memory task and then retested them after they had been given bilateral ablations of either the amygdaloid complex, the hippocampal formation, or both. Monkeys with the combined ablations were severely impaired in both modalities. By contrast, the amygdalectomized monkeys were only moderately impaired in the two modalities, while the hippocampectomized monkeys were impaired in neither. Further examination revealed that the source of the impairment in the monkeys with <b>amygdalectomy</b> alone, unlike that in the animals with combined lesions, was the small size of the pool from which the test objects were drawn. The latter result suggests that, whereas the sensory memory impairment following the combined lesions is basically a recognition loss, the more selective impairment following <b>amygdalectomy</b> alone reflects special difficulty in determiing whether a recognized object was presented recently. By demonstrating that the profound sensory memory impairment that follows combined ablation of the amygdala and hippocampus extends beyond a single modality, the present results strengthen the proposals that (i) these two structures are important for sensory memory in all modalities and (ii) the multimodal or global amnesia observed in patients with medial temporal lobe damage is likewise due t...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Pulmonary {{arteriovenous}} fistula {{is a rare}} vascular abnormality {{in children}} that is usually treated by lobectomy. This report describes a case that was improved by coil embolization. CASE REPORT [...] A thoracic X-ray was routinely taken before <b>amygdalectomy</b> in a 6 year-old girl. It showed a consolidation area in the left superior lobe that persisted despite treatment with erythromycin for 3 weeks. Bronchoscopy was normal, but study of blood gases showed a refractory hypoxemia with moderate cyanosis and hemoglobin at 16. 2 g/dl. Right-heart catheterization and angiography showed a pulmonary arteriovenous fistula that was treated by coil embolization. A control investigation 3 months later showed normal arterial oxygen saturation, hemoglobin at 14. 5 g/dl and reduced pulmonary condensation. CONCLUSION [...] Pulmonary arteriovenous fistula may show few symptoms. Coil embolization {{appears to be a}} useful initial non-aggressive treatment...|$|E
40|$|Six monkeys (Macaca mulatta) {{learned to}} {{discriminate}} visually between pictures of objects. Each pair of pictures was presented only once per day (24 -h intervals between successive trials {{with the same}} pair). Choice of the correct picture of a pair produced immediate food reward. One set of 20 pairs was learned before operation and {{a second set of}} 20 different pairs was learned after the amygdala had been removed bilaterally in three of the monkeys. The amygdalectomized animals were severely retarded in learning the second set. These results confirm earlier results indicating that <b>amygdalectomy</b> impairs visual discrimination learning in tasks where the discriminanda are directly associated with the incentive value of a primary reward, and they show that, contrary to the indication of some previous results, this impairment extends to the case where each picture is seen only once per day...|$|E
40|$|Four {{experiments}} were performed with macaque monkeys (rhesus, Macaca mulatta, and cynomolgus, M. fascicularis). In experiment 1 six rhesus monkeys learned pre-operatively to perform delayed matching-to-sample, with complex naturalistic scenes as the stimulus material. Three of these monkeys then received bilateral ablations of the perirhinal cortex, {{while the other}} three received fornix transection. Both groups showed an impairment postoperatively, but the effect of perirhinal cortex ablation was significantly more severe than the effect of fornix transection. In experiment 2 the same animals, together with three normal, control rhesus monkeys, which had a similar training history, performed simple, spatial discrimination learning in a Wisconsin General Test Apparatus. The animals with fornix transection were impaired, but the animals with ablations of perirhinal cortex were not. In experiment 3 the nine animals from experiment 2 were tested for the acquisition of systematic preferences among four novel foods (apple, lemon, olive, meat). Their results were compared with those from a previously published experiment with normal and amygdalectomized cynomolgus monkeys which {{had been given the}} same food preference test. <b>Amygdalectomy</b> produced a significant disruption of food preference learning but the other two lesions (fornix transection and perirhinal cortex ablation) did not. In experiment 4, 16 rhesus monkeys (9 normal controls, 4 with perirhinal cortex ablation, and 3 with fornix transection) learned to discriminate among complex naturalistic scenes, in a task in which each scene was presented only once per day in {{the main part of the}} experiment. The two operated groups were impaired, and there was no significant difference between the severity of the impairments. Thus, the effects of perirhinal cortex ablation can be doubly dissociated from the effects of fornix transection (experiments 1 and 2) and both can be dissociated from the effects of <b>amygdalectomy</b> (experiment 3). Furthermore, the results of experiment 4 show that the effects of perirhinal cortex ablation are not limited to tasks of memory over short retention intervals. On the basis of the presently reported data and other known effects of perirhinal cortex ablation, it is suggested that this ablation produces an impairment in knowledge (semantic memory) about objects...|$|E
40|$|Monkeys {{were trained}} preoperatively in visual object {{recognition}} memory. The task was delayed matching-to-sample with lists of trial-unique randomly generated visual stimuli in an automated apparatus, and the stimuli were 2 D visual objects made from randomly generated coloured shapes. We then examined {{the effect of}} either: (i) disconnecting the frontal cortex in one hemisphere from the perirhinal cortex in the contralateral hemisphere by crossed unilateral ablations; (ii) disconnecting the magnocellular portion of the mediodorsal (MDmc) thalamic nucleus in one hemisphere from the perirhinal cortex in the contralateral hemisphere; or (iii) bilaterally ablating first the amygdala, then adding fornix transection, then finally perirhinal cortex ablation. We found that both frontal/perirhinal and MDmc/perirhinal disconnection had a large effect on visual object recognition memory, whereas both <b>amygdalectomy</b> {{and the addition of}} fornix transection had only a mild effect. We conclude that the frontal lobe needs to interact with the perirhinal cortex within the same hemisphere for visual object recognition memory, but that routes through the amygdala and hippocampus are not of primary importance...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{amygdala}} lesions {{in the adult}} and infant rat, cat, and monkey were studied and correlated {{with the effects of}} electrical stimulation of subcortical struc-tures in the infant cat. If the amygdala is removed early in life, behavioral development remains rela-tively uninfluenced. After specific functional maturational stages have been reached, the lesion necessitates a reorganization of existing cerebral systems, which manifests as behavioral disturbances, transient or relatively permanent, de-pending upon the plasticity of the systems involved. Phylogenetically, there appears for some functions to be a shift from a physio-logical dependence to an inappropriateness of response. While similar categories of behavior may be affected, the specific syndrome will depend on the degree of encephalization and behavioral specialization. i n] AMYGDALOID NUCLEI and related temporal lobe structures have been im-plicated in influencing a wide variety of behavioral, autonomic, endocrine, and sensory-motor functions. Since the pioneering report of Kluver and Bucy in 1937, 14 it has been well es-tablished that <b>amygdalectomy</b> in the monkey will result in profound altera-tions in affective, sexual, and oral be-havior. Stimulation of the amygdala is capable of producing widespread auto-nomic responses affecting almost every organ system, cortical and behaviora...|$|E
40|$|All {{previous}} reports describing {{alterations in}} emotional reactivity after amygdala damage in monkeys {{were based on}} aspiration or radiofrequency lesions which likely disrupted fibers of passage coursing to and from adjacent ventral and medial temporal cortical areas. To determine whether this associated indirect damage was responsible for {{some or all of}} the changes described earlier, we compared the changes induced by aspiration of the amygdala to those induced by fiber-sparing neurotoxic lesions. Four different stimuli, two with and two without a social component, were used to evaluate the expression of Defense, Aggression, Submission, and Approach responses. In unoperated controls, Defense and Approach behaviors were elicited by all four stimuli, "social" and inanimate alike, whereas Aggression and Submission responses occurred only in the presence of the two "social" stimuli. Furthermore, all Defense reactions were reduced with an attractive inanimate item, while Freezing was selectively increased with an aversive one. Relative to controls, monkeys with neurotoxic amygdala lesions showed the same array of behavioral changes as those with aspiration lesions, namely reduced fear and aggression, increased submission, and excessive manual and oral exploration. Even partial neurotoxic lesions involving less than two-thirds of the amygdala significantly altered fear and manual exploration. These findings convincingly demonstrate that the amygdala is crucial for the normal regulation of emotions in monkeys. Nevertheless, since some of the symptoms observed after neurotoxic lesions were less marked than those seen after aspiration lesions, the emotional disorders described earlier after <b>amygdalectomy</b> in monkeys were likely exacerbated by the attendant fiber damage...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOperative {{treatment}} of epileptogenic cavernous malformations (CM) continues under debate. Most studies focus on surgery for supratentorial CM in general. For temporal lobe CM, surgical decision-making concerns in particular whether to perform lesionectomy alone or the additional excision of mesial temporal structures. The {{purpose of this}} case series was to evaluate operative strategies used to treat epileptogenic temporal CM and to report resultant postoperative seizure outcomes. Twelve consecutive cases of patients with medically intractable epilepsy who underwent operation for temporal CM between 1996 and 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. When the temporal CM directly invaded the hippocampus or amygdala, the affected structures were resected {{in addition to the}} lesion; when the CM was located in the superficial temporal cortex, and there was no radiographic evidence of hippocampal sclerosis, lesionectomy alone was done; with CM located between the superficial temporal cortex and the mesial temporal region, other factors were considered in decision-making, such as lesion proximity to the deep mesiotemporal structures and preoperative epilepsy duration. For six of the twelve patients, extended lesionectomy (EL) alone was done; for the other six, tailored anteromedial temporal resection with hippocampectomy and/or <b>amygdalectomy</b> was performed in addition to EL. Postoperatively, 11 patients – all with preoperative VEM demonstrating electroclinical seizure patterns concordant with lesion location – were seizure-free. We conclude that epileptogenic temporal CM are surgically remediable, when approached with the above operative strategies and presurgical VEM. On the basis of these postoperative seizure control results, we recommend consideration of concurrent resection of mesial temporal structures with EL for certain temporal CM...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeMultiple hippocampal transection (MHT) {{is a new}} {{surgical}} procedure which disrupts seizure propagation within the hippocampus without impairing verbal memory or the loss of stem cells. Since {{there are very few}} papers on this procedure, the authors are presenting their long term results to increase the database on this procedure. MethodLong term outcome in 15 consecutive patients who had MHT for unlilateral temporal lobe epilepsy, had intra-operative electro-corticography (ECoG) and have a minimum follow-up of at least 2 years is presented. The male/female ratio is 2 / 1; follow-up is 24 – 60 months (median of 41 months); and ages between 25 and 60 years. All patients had multiple subpial transection (MST) on the neocortex and MHT on the hippocampus. <b>Amygdalectomy</b> was done if seizure focus was present in the amygdala (10 patients). Temporal tip (1. 5 – 2. 5 cm in length) was resected (11 patients) when it was resistant to MST, based on intraoperative EEG recordings. ResultsThere was no permanent neurological complication. Fourteen patients (94. 7 %) are seizure free (Engel's Class I) and 1 (5. 3 %) has rare seizures (Class II). Neuropsychological studies showed that verbal memory was preserved. ConclusionThe results show that the seizure outcome with MHT is equal or better than those reported with standard temporal lobectomy. Furthermore verbal memory is preserved. The study also shows that intraoperative ECoG is important in order to conclude adequacy of the procedure. Based on the result of this study the authors feel that this procedure needs to be persued as an alternate to hippocampectomy...|$|E
40|$|Five cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were {{assessed}} {{for their ability}} to associate visual stimuli with food reward. They learned a series of new two-choice visual discriminations between coloured patterns displayed on a touch-sensitive monitor screen; the feedback for correct choice was delivery of food. Normal learning in this task is known to be dependent on the amygdala. The monkeys received brain lesions which were designed to disconnect the amygdala from interaction with other brain structures thought to be involved in this memory task. All the monkeys received an <b>amygdalectomy</b> in one hemisphere and lesions in the other hemisphere of some of the projection targets of the amygdala, namely the ventral striatum, the mediodorsal thalamus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The rate of learning new problems was assessed before and after each operation. Disconnection of the amygdala from the ventral striatum was without effect on learning rate. An earlier study had shown that disconnection of the amygdala from either the mediodorsal thalamus or the ventromedial prefrontal cortex produced only a mild impairment, significantly less severe than that produced by bilateral lesions of any of these three structures. The present results show, however, that disconnection of the amygdala from both the mediodorsal thalamus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the same animal, by crossed unilateral lesions of the amygdala in one hemisphere and of both the mediodorsal thalamus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the other hemisphere, produces an impairment as severe as that which follows bilateral lesions of any of these three structures.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{explanation of}} dense amnesia after medial temporal lesions {{is that the}} amnesia is caused by damage to the hippocampus and related structures. An alternative view is that dense amnesia after medial temporal lesions {{is caused by the}} interruption of afferents to the temporal cortex from the basal forebrain. These afferents travel to the temporal cortex through three pathways, namely the anterior temporal stem, the amygdala and the fornix-fimbria, and all these three pathways are damaged in dense medial temporal amnesia. In four experiments using different memory tasks, we tested the effects on memory of sectioning some or all of these three pathways in macaque monkeys. In a test of scene-specific memory for objects, which is analogous in some ways to human episodic memory, section of fornix alone, or section of amygdala and anterior temporal stem sparing the fornix, each produced a significant but mild impairment. When fornix section was added to the section of anterior temporal stem and amygdala in this task, however, a very severe impairment resulted. In an object recognition memory task (delayed matching-to-sample) a severe impairment was seen after section of anterior temporal stem and amygdala alone, with or without the addition of fornix section; this impairment was significantly more severe than that which was seen in the same task after <b>amygdalectomy</b> leaving the temporal stem intact, with or without fornix section. Animals with combined section of anterior temporal stem, amygdala and fornix were also impaired in object-reward association learning. However, the retention of pre-operatively acquired object-reward associations was at a high level. These results show that the pattern of impairments after section of anterior temporal stem, amygdala and fornix in the monkey, leaving hippocampus intact, resembles human dense amnesia and is different from the effects of hippocampal lesions in the monkey...|$|E
