5|$|From Thunderball {{through to}} Die Another Day, the gun barrel {{sequence}} segues into the pre-title sequence {{by having the}} opening shot be sighted through the barrel. Beginning with The Spy Who Loved Me, the teasers emphasised not only action sequences but stunts, <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> <b>that</b> prevailed until Casino Royale. The sequence for The World Is Not Enough is unusually long: at over fourteen minutes it is {{two to three times}} the length of most others.|$|E
5|$|Many procellariids have {{breeding}} {{populations of}} over several million pairs; others number fewer than 200 birds. Humans have traditionally exploited {{several species of}} fulmar and shearwater (known as muttonbirds) for food, fuel, and bait, <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> <b>that</b> continues in a controlled fashion today. Several species are threatened by introduced species attacking adults and chicks in breeding colonies and by long-line fisheries.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises are {{commonly}} used in traditional medicine across their geographic range, <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> <b>that</b> has been reported since at least 1900. Thousands of slow lorises are captured each year for such use. Many human factors drive the trade in slow loris parts, including social customs, economic factors, and traditional belief systems.|$|E

5|$|The term {{metalloid}} originally {{referred to}} nonmetals. Its more recent meaning, {{as a category}} of elements with intermediate or hybrid properties, became widespread in 1940–1960. Metalloids are sometimes called semimetals, <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> <b>that</b> has been discouraged, as the term semimetal has a different meaning in physics than in chemistry. In physics it more specifically refers to the electronic band structure of a substance.|$|E
5|$|This {{suggestion}} was acted upon and in 1889 the first non-native fish were stocked into Yellowstone waters, <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> <b>that</b> continued until 1955 and {{helped create the}} angling experience Yellowstone National Park is renowned for.|$|E
5|$|To {{supplement}} their incomes, the rangers trapped predators such as coyote, fox, lynx, mountain lion, and wolverine for their furs, <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> <b>that</b> survived until 1925.

5|$|After Eleanor's marriage, {{many of her}} Savoyard {{relatives}} {{joined her}} in England. At least 170 Savoyards arrived in England after 1236, coming from Savoy, Burgundy and Flanders, including Eleanor's uncles: Boniface became the Archbishop of Canterbury, and William became Henry's chief adviser for a short period. Henry arranged marriages {{for many of them}} into the English nobility, <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> <b>that</b> initially caused friction with the English barons, who resisted landed estates passing into the hands of foreigners. The Savoyards were careful not to exacerbate the situation and became increasingly integrated into English baronial society, forming an important power base for Eleanor in England.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of issue 6 in August 2012, Vaughan announced that the series would take a two-month hiatus, after which the first six-issue story arc was published in trade paperback form in October for $9.99 before the series' return in November, <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> <b>that</b> Vaughan and Staples would continue after each successive story arc and trade paperback publication. That same month, Vaughan and Staples promoted the series by appearing together at the 2012 New York Comic Con, their first appearance together since the series' debut. Some retailers refused to display the trade paperback because its cover (a reuse of the first issue's cover) depicts Alana breastfeeding Hazel.|$|E
5|$|As {{indicated}} in the temple records, the priests of the temple were Shiva ascetics called Dandi Sanyasis, who belonged to Nambudiri community, a religious group common in modern Kerala. When {{the last of the}} ascetics died without an heir in 1776 AD, the king invited non-ascetic Nambudiris from Kerala for priesthood, <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> <b>that</b> continues in modern times. Till 1939, all the offerings made by the devotees to the temple went to the Rawal (chief priest), but after 1939, his jurisdiction was restricted to religious affairs. The administrative structure of the temple consists of a chief executive officer who executes the orders from the state government, a deputy chief executive officer, two OSDs, an executive officer, an account officer, a temple officer and a publicity officer to assist the chief executive officer.|$|E

5|$|Birds {{have been}} domesticated by humans both as pets and for {{practical}} purposes. Colourful birds, such as parrots and mynas, are bred in captivity or kept as pets, <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> <b>that</b> {{has led to}} the illegal trafficking of some endangered species. Falcons and cormorants have long been used for hunting and fishing, respectively. Messenger pigeons, used since at least 1 AD, remained important as recently as World War II. Today, such activities are more common either as hobbies, for entertainment and tourism, or for sports such as pigeon racing.|$|E
5|$|Colors {{accepted}} by the breed registry include chestnut, bay and seal brown (the latter called black pangaré by the breed registry, although these horses are genetically brown, not black with pangaré markings). Bays with white markings are the most popular. Norman Cobs are known as calm, willing horses with strong personalities. The breed's Thoroughbred ancestry gives them energy and athleticism, and makes them mature faster than other draft breeds. They show great endurance when ridden, and are relatively hardy, accepting outdoor living and changes in climate. Traditionally the Norman Cob had its tail docked, <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> <b>that</b> continued until January 1996, when the practice became illegal in France.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, the regiment, {{in common}} with other Yeomanry and Militia units, sported a range of uniforms. Jackets were always dark blue. Between 1812 and 1873, a leather shako was worn, {{replaced}} in 1873 by a fur Busby with a red cloth bag. Service dress during the First World War was a khaki tunic and breeches, with a red stripe down the seam and a red lanyard worn by all ranks round the left armpit. The chevrons of sergeants and corporals were surmounted by a regimental badge on a red baize backing, <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> <b>that</b> continued through the inter-war years and beyond.|$|E

5|$|Having earlier {{been led}} by Wing Commander Blake Pelly, by June 1943 No.73 Wing {{was under the}} command of Group Captain Ian McLachlan. That month, McLachlan {{established}} his headquarters at Goodenough Island, where the wing was reorganised as a fighter formation consisting of No.76 Squadron (flying P-40 Kittyhawks), No.77 Squadron (Kittyhawks) and No.79 Squadron (Supermarine Spitfires). As well as providing local air defence, and fighter escort for Australian bombers, the Kittyhawks were themselves armed with incendiary and general-purpose bombs so that they could engage in ground-attack missions, <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> <b>that</b> had already been employed by Commonwealth forces in the Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, Fisher {{was elected}} {{as the first}} {{president}} of the Gympie branch of the Labour Party. In 1893, {{he was elected to the}} Legislative Assembly of Queensland as Labour member for Gympie and by the following year had become Labour's deputy leader in the Legislative Assembly. In his maiden speech, he pushed for a 50% decrease in military spending and declared support for a federation. Another policy area that captured his attention during this term, was the employment of workers from the Pacific Islands in sugar plantations, <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> <b>that</b> Fisher and Labour both strongly opposed. He lost his seat in 1896 following a campaign in which he was charged by his opponent Jacob Stumm with being a dangerous revolutionary and an anti-Catholic, accusations that were propagated by the newspaper Gympie Times.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, the German Army invaded Yugoslavia and Greece. The LSSAH and Das Reich were {{attached}} to separate army Panzer corps. Fritz Klingenberg, a company commander in the Das Reich, led his men across Yugoslavia to the capital, Belgrade, where a small group in the vanguard accepted the surrender of the city on 13 April. A few days later Yugoslavia surrendered. SS police units immediately began taking hostages and carrying out reprisals, <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> <b>that</b> became common. In some cases, {{they were joined by}} the Wehrmacht. Similar to Poland, the war policies of the Nazis in the Balkans resulted in brutal occupation and racist mass murder.

5|$|In Han's wake, other {{cultural}} figures, like Ch'oe Sŭnghŭi and Sim Yŏng, were purged also. The regime faced {{a problem in}} Han's work being politically useful in nature but his name tarnished. His name began to be disconnected from his work, which was still widely disseminated. For the future, North Korean publishing authorities would employ a policy of publishing collective works of creative teams and withhold names of individual authors, <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> <b>that</b> was observed particularly in the 1970s and started to wane only in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{operating}} as {{an association of}} independently owned teams, MLS is a single entity in which each team is owned and controlled by the league's investors. The investor-operators control their teams as owners control teams in other leagues, and are commonly (but inaccurately) {{referred to as the}} team's owners. The league has a fixed membership, like most sports leagues in the United States and Canada, which makes it one of the world's few soccer leagues that does not use promotion and relegation, <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> <b>that</b> is uncommon in the two countries. MLS headquarters is located in New York City.|$|E
