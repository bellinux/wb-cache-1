It was {{released}} the following year and featured mostly songs written from 1995 to 2002. 2003 also saw the release of Hollywood Potato Chip, which strayed <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> the pop-punk formula of their 1990s work.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} {{was the first of}} three {{consecutive}} summit finishes that preceded the second rest day. Contador, alongside José Rujano, took the opportunity to further stamp his authority on the race, taking another minute and a half out of the race's other top riders. Sivtsov lost two minutes and 42 seconds to Contador, and more significantly a little over a minute to the race's other leading riders. This dropped him to sixth place overall. He lost more time on the Zoncolan the next day, though his overall position remained unchanged. Stage 15 was the first time no HTC-Highroad rider occupied a position in the top ten, as Sivtsov dropped to 12th overall by losing close to seven minutes in the Giro's queen stage. Pinotti rebounded <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> a disappointing second half of the Giro to ride to eighth place in the stage 16 individual time trial.|$|E

25|$|The stage version {{differed}} quite <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> the book, and {{was aimed}} primarily at adults. Toto {{was replaced with}} Imogene the Cow, and Tryxie Tryfle (a waitress) and Pastoria (a streetcar operator) were added as fellow cyclone victims. The Wicked Witch of the West was eliminated entirely in the script, and the plot became about how the four friends were allied with the usurping Wizard and were hunted as traitors to Pastoria II, the rightful King of Oz. It is unclear how much control or influence Baum had on the script; it appears {{that many of the}} changes were written by Baum against his wishes due to contractual requirements with Hamlin. Jokes in the script, mostly written by Glen MacDonough, called for explicit references to President Theodore Roosevelt, Senator Mark Hanna, Rev. Andrew Danquer, and oil magnate John D. Rockefeller. Although use of the script was rather free-form, the line about Hanna was ordered dropped as soon as Hamlin got word of his death in 1904.|$|E
25|$|Achieving city {{status in}} 1484, Galway celebrated its quincentenary in 1984. Galway {{in itself is}} not {{particularly}} known for its attractions, but rather for its lively atmosphere and entertainment scene. This is partly because 25% {{of the population of}} Galway (75,529 in 2011) is made up of students primarily from NUI Galway and GMIT, two third level institutes in the city. Galway is particularly popular with American tourists as Galway {{is said to be the}} most 'Irish' of Ireland's cities, and is one of the few urban areas where you are likely to hear Irish spoken, due to the fact the Gaeltacht area of Connemara is only a few kilometres away. The biggest lake in the country, Lough Corrib, is situated north of the city. The ferry to the Aran Islands is located about 40 minutes away and departs from the village of Rossaveal regularly. The Aran Islands are located in Galway Bay, and the Irish Language is by far the most used language on the islands, with the vast majority using the language regularly. As the islands are quite <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> the mainland, cars are quite rare and the main form of transport is the bicycle.|$|E
500|$|Kelly {{described}} his songwriting as [...] "a scavenging art, a desperate act. For me it's <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> here, <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> there, fumbling around, never quite knowing what you're doing ... Song writing {{is like a}} way of feeling connected to mystery." [...] He has resisted the label of 'storyteller' and insists that his songs are not strictly autobiographical; [...] "they come from imagining someone in a particular situation. Sometimes a sequence of events happens which makes it more a story, but other times it's just that situation". Sometimes the same character is found in different songs, such as in [...] "To Her Door", [...] "Love Never Runs on Time", and [...] "How to Make Gravy".|$|E

Shakespeare seems to have diverted quite <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> this image, making the witches (as Banquo says) [...] "withered, and so wild in their attire, / That look not like th' inhabitants o' th' earth[...] [...] each at once her choppy fingers laying / Upon her skinny lips.

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido of Tor.com said it was [...] "A mostly {{harmless}} episode that lifts quite <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> The Cliché Handbook". He thought the performances were fairly solid and that the overall message about the ozone layer was [...] "unsubtle but not too sledgehammery". DeCandido praised Patrick Stewart's performance of Captain Picard, noting that his [...] "anger and outrage and justified self-righteousness at the kidnapping of children modulates nicely into diplomacy when negotiating with the Aldeans and amusingly into total discomfort when he has to actually deal directly with the children". He gave the episode a score of six out of ten. James Hunt, writing for Den of Geek, said that it was [...] "a decent enough story, but not in a way that makes you want to watch it". He also felt that it was [...] "a complete throwaway episode and contains almost nothing unique to the franchise".|$|E
500|$|Roper {{said that}} {{there were a couple of}} puzzles [...] "that seemed a little rough around the edges and whose {{otherwise}} straightforward solution suffered <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> imperfect implementation." [...] He also criticized the difficulty of unlocking some of the bonus content, as some requirements are [...] "punishingly hard for most everyone." [...] Reed, however, said if players can find any flaws, they are based on [...] "personal taste", but also stated that regardless of refinement, [...] "you can never quite replicate the wow factor of the original—even if it ends up being a better game." [...] Navarro said that at times, the combat is [...] "overly straightforward ... and still prone to button mashing," [...] and said that it was [...] "a bit disappointing" [...] that more was not done to the combat system. He criticized the cliffhanger ending and said a few of the bonus challenges [...] "aren't all that great." [...] GameTrailers criticized the invisible walls, stating that [...] "There are places you should be able to go that you simply can't." [...] They also cited inconsistency issues in regards to navigation. Leone said his [...] "only real" [...] disappointment is that he did not feel the game was evolving the series.|$|E

500|$|Street Fighter X Mega Man {{has been}} met with mostly mixed to {{positive}} reviews. [...] Cheat Code Central gave the game a 4.1 out of 5, praising the nostalgic feel the game has, but criticized {{the lack of}} a save feature. Game Informer gave the game an 8 out of 10, summarizing that [...] "Street Fighter X Mega Man pales in comparison {{to the rest of the}} classic entries, but it’s still a wonderful test of the waters for newcomers and a charming experiment for lifelong fans." [...] Inside Gaming Daily gave the game an 8 out of 10, stating, [...] "Though it’s short and strays away <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> traditional Mega Man games, Street Fighter X Mega Man is a great play that you honestly have little reason not to experience." [...] IGN gave the game a 7 out of 10, noting that [...] "The end result is a fine game that Mega Man fans will enjoy once or twice, but one without that special something that would allow it to rise to the greatness Mega Man so regularly reached in its heyday." [...] Destructoid echoed similar opinions stating, [...] "Street Fighter X Mega Man is not the best or most polished Mega Man game around, but it's a solid effort by a very dedicated fan." [...] Game Industry News gave it a 3.5 out of 5 with mixed review stating, [...] "It combines two of Capcom's greatest games in history into one nostalgic mash up that is sure to take fans on a trip down memory lane while still feeling fresh. Unfortunately though, the lack of challenge or the ability to continue progress after shutting down the game only hinders Street Fighter X Mega Man from being the perfect jewel it could have been." [...] Edge however gave the game a 5 out of 10, noting [...] "inconsistent level design and limited functionality" [...] as the game's biggest flaws.|$|E

2500|$|The early Zionist {{settlers}} originated this eclectic style.

Elements were borrowed <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> Arabic music and, to a lesser extent, traditional Yemenite and eastern Jewish music.
