This applies even more for economies emerging from the transformation process from a state {{to a market economy}} with a small export sector and a continuous {{decline in the number of}} residents. The federal state Thuringia presents such an example. There is still a large gap in exports compared to Germany as a whole. The paper deals with the role of exports in economic development and economic measures to increase the export activities of small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) in Thuringia. The study is based on a survey among SMEs in Thuringia on the performance of exporters and non-exporters. One of the main findings shows that export promotion was important only for one among three exporting companies during the last three years. That speaks for the confidence of the firms in their own power. The most measures used to implement or <b>advance</b> <b>export</b> activities are participation in a fair, information sessions on foreign markets and two general instruments to support companies: investment and innovation stimulation.

40|$|AbstractMany {{construction}} and technological firms grew beyond borders of their countries since their market size couldn’t absorb their growing production capacities. Similarly, orientation to certain market segments forced these firms to go abroad {{in order to}} sustain their revenues, further improve their specialization and expand shareholder value. Due to increasing competition in the world market, traditional prerequisites do not necessarily have to lead to success in international bids. In addition to technological excellence, long-lasting experience, quality and cost leadership, securing project financing can {{play a crucial role}} in project bids. International Joint Venture (IJV), led by Siemens, gained an order with an international bid for delivery of two power plants with combined cycle to Oman, due to securing project financing for multinational investor. Project financing, arranged by German state-owned KfW IPEX-Bank, proved to be the turning point in this international tender. Siemens and its Korean partner successfully delivered both power plants in full conformance to investor's requirements. Despite uneasy market conditions and financial markets recovering from financial crises, German and Korean government export credit agencies (ECAs) opened new export opportunity, in order to support their home economies. Whereas jobs in Germany were secured, Siemens as a leading contractor improved its market position within the region of Middle East. At the same time, Sultanate of Oman gained access to highly efficient power sources with low impact on environment. This reference study demonstrates increasing and necessary role of government export-oriented agencies and banks for reaching exporters’ success in international business. The main objective of this paper is to contribute to identification of exporter's key success factors, when delivering project on export financing principles.

40|$|The rapid {{globalization}} {{in recent}} years has created a radically new competitive situation for the rich industrialized countries. Newly industrialized countries and not least China have become more and more successful in penetrating the markets in the rich industrialized countries with increasingly more <b>advanced</b> <b>export</b> products. This has generated a discussion in the rich industrialized countries on how to meet this increased international competition. In some countries demands for various protective measures have been raised while in others the discussion has mainly focused on how to develop a competitive strategy mainly concentrating on making the own products more sophisticated by increasing their knowledge content. This is by no means since the direct product development is controlled to a high extent by multinational firms, which to an increasing degree are foreign owned. Governments mainly have to rely on indirect measures, such as increasing the volume of higher education and public, mainly university R&D. This raises the question: how responsive is private industry to these kinds of indirect measures. Against this background, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to analyze to what extent that the location and the extent of higher education and university R&D, respectively, influence the location and the extent of industry R&D in Sweden using an accessibility approach. After an extensive literature survey, we develop a simple theoretical model for the location of R&D from the perspective of a multinational enterprise. From this theoretical model, we then deduce our empirical model, which we then estimate in the form of a Tobit model using data from Swedish labour market regions and municipalities. We show that the location of industry R&D in Sweden can be partly explained by the intra-municipal accessibility to students in higher education, while the accessibility to university R&D turned out to be insignificantindustry R&D; university R&D; higher education; region; municipality; location; accessibility; Tobit model; Sweden...|$|R

To overcome these problems and {{to take advantage of}} international studies on the needs of small economies, this report makes an argument for substantial government involvement in the areas of industry, innovation, research and associated policies. Manufacturing is a vital and significant contributor to the Australian economy with well understood multiplier effects {{on the rest of the}} economy that are larger than for any other sector. Manufacturing, like all sectors, is continuously changing. This can be seen through the increasing presence of services and solutions in the business offerings of manufacturing firms. This growing servitisation is blurring traditional boundaries of industry and causes reliability issues in public statistics. One consequence of this is an underestimation of the growth, size and importance of the manufacturing industry in modern economies. In spite of Australia's long record of achievement in manufacturing, our performance compared to leading manufacturing nations like Sweden, Finland, Germany and Switzerland is relatively poor. This is cause for concern, as manufacturing is the primary source of technological innovation across the Australian business sector. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the success of countries like Sweden has been widely ascribed to their technologically <b>advanced</b> <b>export</b> oriented manufacturing. Now, more than ever, it is important to be a country that makes things.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the detrimental consequences of financial market imperfections for international trade. I develop a heterogeneous-firm model with countries {{at different levels}} of financial development and sectors of varying financial vulnerability. Applying this model to aggregate trade data, I study the mechanisms through which credit constraints operate. First, financial development increases countries' exports above and beyond its impact on overall production. Firm selection into exporting accounts for a third of the trade-specific effect, while two thirds are due to reductions in firm-level <b>exports.</b> Second, financially <b>advanced</b> economies <b>export</b> a wider range of products and their exports experience less product turnover. Finally, while all countries service large destinations, exporters with superior financial institutions have more trading partners and also enter smaller markets. All of these effects are magnified in financially vulnerable sectors. These results have important policy implications for less developed economies that rely on exports for economic growth but suffer from poor financial contractibility. ...|$|R

In this method, the competitiveness of Turkish products is examined vis-à-vis her competitors in the EU market.

40|$|Purpose – Based on {{integrating}} learning, resource-based {{and social}} network theories, {{the purpose of}} this paper is to shed fresh light on the association between export experience and export performance by seeking to better understand the links between them, and assessing the boundary conditions, moderators, mediators, and non-linear relationships in greater depth. Design/methodology/approach – This paper mobilizes a quantitative research design using a survey of Brazil-based exporters. The authors test the hypotheses proposed in this study by employing moderated mediation regression models. Findings – The authors find support for a J-shape relationship between export experience and export market performance. In particular, the authors find that innovation and international marketing resources mediate the effect of export experience on export market performance, and the authors unveil that this mediation effect is contingent on the strength of international business network ties. Originality/value – This study <b>advances</b> the <b>export</b> marketing literature by explaining how export experience drives export success in two ways: first, by clarifying the ambiguity in extant theoretical explanations and previous empirical findings regarding the shape of the relationship between export experience and export performance. Second, this study reconciles the disagreement as to whether superior export performance results from exporters’ existing resources or from their learning by exporting. Thus, the paper is valuable for scholars and export managers or policymakers alike by providing recommendations on how less experienced firms can overcome the initial period of weak export performance.

Background Accelerating the nation’s current sluggish pace of recovery from the Great Recession is ultimately going to require increased investment in the things that spur lasting growth: research and development (R&D), <b>advanced</b> industry <b>exports,</b> infrastructure, education, and skills-building. However, given the current fiscal climate—with federal debt held by the public expected to reach over 90 percent of GDP in 2020 under current policies and spending as a percentage of GDP already at historically high levels—the prospect of identifying new, dedicated sources of revenue for public investment appears wholly unrealistic, both politically and from a budget perspective. Where, then, can policymakers find the funds needed for public investment at a moment of fiscal constraint? One approach is to identify redundant, wasteful, and ineffective programs and reduce or eliminate (cut) them; and then redirect some of the savings (invest) to priority areas with the potential for significant public benefits. Building on work in the 1990 s by Robert Shapiro, then of the Progressive Policy Institute and Bill Clinton’s principal economic advisor in the 1991 - 92 campaign, such an approach holds out real promise for squaring the goals of fiscal discipline and institutional reform with the need to expand support for the specific public investments that make people and firms more productive.

The German economy participates in the worldwide upswing. Here the recovery is ahead of those in most other <b>advanced</b> economies. Both <b>exports</b> and domestic demand are strongly expanding. One reason for the high growth dynamics is that key interest rates are particularly low for Germany, as the ECB has {{to take into account}} that many euro area economies are much more fragile. In addition, Germany still benefits from the wage moderation and the labour market reforms in the past decade: employment is expanding strongly, and firms find many profitable investment projects. Major risks for this forecast are structural problems of some advanced economies that had become visible during the Great Recession and are still unresolved (concerning the US housing market and the crisis of confidence in the fiscal sustainability of some euro area countries in particular).

Initially it had quarter elliptic leaf spring rear suspension, but with an axle locating trailing arm, that was upgraded to stronger semi-elliptic to cope with overloading by customers. The front suspension was independent and was used as the basis of the suspension of the first English Cooper racing cars in the 1940s that became successful in the 1950s. It had a four speed gearbox (when three was common) and all hydraulic brakes. It was a similar size to the Austin Seven but much more <b>advanced.</b> It was <b>exported</b> all over the world and produced at the NSU factory in Germany, Steyr-Puch in Austria and Simca in France. It was facelifted with American influenced 'full width styling' of the frontal panels after the war, with headlights integrated into the wings/fenders.|$|R
