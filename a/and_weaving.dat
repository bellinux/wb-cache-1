50|$|Corded <b>and</b> <b>woven</b> {{strapping}} {{are available}} in several constructions, primarily involving polyester and rayon. Some types are reusable. Because this system uses a buckle for a joint, corded <b>and</b> <b>woven</b> strapping can have a larger system strength than steel banding. Corded polyester strapping also has a higher elongation than other strapping systems, which gives it an ideal memory for sea and rail shipments. Because corded <b>and</b> <b>woven</b> polyester straps are light and soft, they are also a safer alternative to steel banding.|$|R

5|$|Apart {{from the}} dignitaries {{who lived in}} Chadderton's manor houses, Chadderton's {{population}} during the Middle Ages comprised a small community of retainers, {{most of whom were}} occupied in farming, either growing and milling of grain and cereal or raising cattle, sheep, pigs and domestic fowl. Workers supplemented their incomes by hand-loom spinning <b>and</b> <b>weaving</b> of wool at home. The community was ravaged by an outbreak of the Black Death in 1646.|$|E

Bakreshwar Thermal Power Station is the only heavy industry in the district.|$|E

Among these are mostly anthropomorphic earthenware jars dating from c. 5BC to 225AD. Weaving was mostly done by women, using fibers from abaca, pineapple, cotton, and bark to make clothes, rugs and hats. Baskets were mostly utilized to carry grain and other foods.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{resurgence}} of Māori culture, the traditional crafts of carving <b>and</b> <b>weaving</b> are now more widely practised and Māori artists are increasing in number and influence. Most Māori carvings feature human figures, generally with three fingers and either a natural-looking, detailed head or a grotesque head. Surface patterns consisting of spirals, ridges, notches and fish scales decorate most carvings. The pre-eminent Māori architecture consisted of carved meeting houses (wharenui) decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations. These buildings were originally designed to be constantly rebuilt, changing and adapting to different whims or needs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 16th century, {{although}} {{agriculture and}} the dairy industry, particularly the production of Leigh cheese, sometimes known as Leigh Toaster, were important, spinning <b>and</b> <b>weaving</b> began to develop as a cottage industry. Work was supplied from Manchester by agents who brought work weekly often to an inn, and where they collected the finished cloth. At first the work was done to supplement the income of local farmers and their families. The cloth woven in Leigh was fustian, a sort of rough corduroy, and by {{the end of the}} 17th century middlemen, fustian masters, were dealing directly with weavers and selling the finished cloth in Manchester.|$|E

5|$|From about 1790 {{textiles}} {{became the}} most important industry in the west of Scotland, especially the spinning <b>and</b> <b>weaving</b> of cotton, which flourished until in 1861 the American Civil War cut off the supplies of raw cotton. The industry never recovered, {{but by that time}} Scotland had developed heavy industries based on its coal and iron resources. The invention of the hot blast for smelting iron (1828) revolutionised the Scottish iron industry. As a result, Scotland became a centre for engineering, shipbuilding and the production of locomotives. Toward the end of the 19th century, steel production largely replaced iron production.|$|E
5|$|Mannargudi {{was founded}} as an agraharam village by the Medieval Cholas during the 11th century. The town was {{subsequently}} ruled by various dynasties including the Medieval Chola king Rajadhiraja Chola (1018–1054 CE),Vijayanagar Empire, Delhi Sultanate, Thanjavur Nayaks, Thanjavur Marathas and the British Empire. Mannargudi {{was a part}} of the erstwhile Tanjore district until India's independence in 1947 and Thanjavur district until 1991 and subsequently a part of the newly formed Tiruvarur district. The town is known for agriculture, metal working <b>and</b> <b>weaving.</b> The region around Mannargudi has considerable mineral deposits.|$|E
5|$|Originally an {{agricultural}} area noted for dairy farming, domestic spinning <b>and</b> <b>weaving</b> {{led to a}} considerable silk and, in the 20th century, cotton industry. Leigh also exploited the underlying coal measures particularly after the town {{was connected to the}} canals and railways. Leigh had an important engineering base. The legacy of Leigh's industrial past {{can be seen in the}} remaining red brick mills– some of which are listed buildings– although it is now a mainly residential town, with Edwardian and Victorian terraced housing packed around the town centre. Leigh's present-day economy is based largely on the retail sector.|$|E
