5|$|Pokémon Channel is {{difficult}} to categorize into a genre, as it incorporates elements of adventure, simulation, and digital pet games. The graphics are in 3D, the perspective is first-person, and the player navigates and selects things with a cursor. The game centers on watching television programs with a Pikachu, a mouse-like Pokémon. The player, {{who lives in a}} house, can channel-surf freely among the various channels of a television network created by the pokémon professor, Professor Oak, as well as explore one room of the house and several outdoor areas. Pikachu sometimes displays emotional reactions while watching, such as happiness or anger. The game takes place over a few days, with unique plot events on each. The GameCube's inner clock tracks time such that every in-game day lasts at least <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> real-time day.|$|E
5|$|To {{serve as}} governor, {{one must be}} at least 30 years old, be a citizen of the United States, and have been a {{resident}} of the state {{for at least two years}} prior to election. The state constitution of 1876 originally called for election of the governor every two years, with their term beginning on the second Tuesday of the January following the election. An amendment passed in 1956, taking effect in 1959, increased terms to four years. Originally, there was no term limit applied to the governor; a 1990 amendment allowed governors to succeed themselves only once. There is however no limit on the total number of terms one may serve <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> who has served the two term limit is out of office for four years.|$|E

25|$|The {{range was}} {{available}} with 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0L petrol engines, with the 1.8-litre four available with an optional turbocharger. The VG20ET V6 was offered {{for the first}} time in Japan in 1984, in a model with an extended front end, called the Bluebird Maxima. This 2-litre V6 was available naturally aspirated or as an intercooled turbo. The U11 Maxima featured a larger 3.0L VG30E. There were also naturally aspirated or turbocharged 2-litre diesels. Counterintuitively, the turbodiesel had better gas mileage in standardized test cycles, presumably due to it being less stressed – <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> did not take full advantage of its better performance.|$|E

25|$|One {{classical}} algorithm, {{which is}} both simple and flexible, is based on finding the next permutation in lexicographic ordering, if it exists. It can handle repeated values, for which case it generates the distinct multiset permutations each once. Even for ordinary permutations it is significantly more efficient than generating values for the Lehmer code in lexicographic order (possibly using the factorial number system) and converting those to permutations. To use it, one starts by sorting the sequence in (weakly) increasing order (which gives its lexicographically minimal permutation), and then repeats advancing to the next permutation <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> is found. The method goes back to Narayana Pandita in 14th century India, and has been frequently rediscovered ever since.|$|E
25|$|Fannia scalaris, {{also known}} as the latrine fly, is a fly species in the Fanniidae family. This species is smaller and more slender than the house fly, Musca domestica, and is similar in {{appearance}} to the lesser house fly, Fannia canicularis. The life cycle of this species can be <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> month. These flies are globally distributed in urban areas as they are drawn to unsanitary environments. F. scalaris is a major cause of myiasis, the infestation of a body cavity by fly maggots. The adults infest bodies that have decomposed, making the species an important part of forensic entomology. The larvae of this fly have adapted protuberances, or feathered appendages, that allow them to survive in such a moist environment. Entomologists continue to research the effects that F. scalaris may have medically, forensically, and on the environment around them.|$|E
25|$|At Roadblock: End of the Line, Charlotte Flair {{defeated}} Sasha Banks to win {{her record}} fourth Raw Women's Championship, ending their long feud and, as per a post-event stipulation, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> of them were champion, the other could not challenge for the title. Charlotte then began a feud with Bayley, {{which resulted in a}} championship match at the Royal Rumble, where Charlotte retained. Also during this time, Sasha entered into a feud with Nia Jax, who defeated Sasha on the Royal Rumble pre-show. The next night on Raw, Bayley pinned Charlotte in a six-person mixed tag team match, thus granting her a rematch for the title on the February 13 episode of Raw, where she defeated Charlotte to become the new Raw Women's Champion, thanks to help from Sasha. The following week, Raw Commissioner Stephanie McMahon asked Bayley to relinquish her title due to Sasha's interference, but Bayley refused and Charlotte invoked her championship rematch for Fastlane, which saw Bayley retain after Sasha, who had just defeated Jax, again interfered, which subsequently ended Charlotte's undefeated streak in singles matches at pay-per-view events. The following night on Raw, Sasha said that she and Bayley should face off for the title at WrestleMania 33 as it was a dream of theirs to face each other at the event. Charlotte came out and demanded that she should have a rematch due to Sasha's interference and said that Sasha interfered due to the Roadblock stipulation. Raw General Manager Mick Foley then scheduled Charlotte to face Sasha in which the winner would challenge Bayley for the title at WrestleMania. However, Stephanie decided to keep Charlotte in the championship match at WrestleMania, but allowed Sasha the opportunity {{to be added to the}} match if she could defeat Bayley that night, which she did. The following week, Sasha defeated Charlotte's ally Dana Brooke, whom Charlotte had ordered to take out Sasha. Charlotte then fired and insulted Dana, who attacked Charlotte in retaliation. Nia Jax was also given the opportunity to challenge for the championship at WrestleMania if she could defeat Bayley. However, Nia lost the match by disqualification as she kept attacking Bayley beyond the referee's five count, but the following week, Nia defeated Bayley in a rematch that was no disqualification, earning her a spot in the championship match at WrestleMania. The following week prior to Raw, the match was turned into a fatal four-way elimination match. On Raw, Bayley and Sasha teamed up and defeated Charlotte and Nia. After the match, Nia laid out her three WrestleMania opponents.|$|E

500|$|..... a basic {{principle}} of triage {{is to treat}} victims having the most life-threatening injuries first with available medical resources and to utilize limited medical personnel {{in a manner that}} will provide maximum effectiveness.

They survived after periods of underwater, including sea water, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> hour or more. In view of these facts, the Safety Board believes that all emergency response organizations should review their emergency plans to include contingencies for applying cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) techniques as soon as a sufficient number of trained personnel arrive to perform CPR, even during mass casualty/triage incidents, regardless of whether vital signs are present, especially if cold-water immersion/near drowning is involved and where traumatic injuries do not indicate death.|$|E
