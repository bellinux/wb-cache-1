5|$|Archaeological {{findings}} in the fields between West and East Worldham reveal that the <b>area</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> visited and inhabited {{since at least the}} Palaeolithic era. An Iron Age Hillfort, dated to around 100 BC, lay on the summit of King John's Hill, to the east of East Worldham. The Romans built a road from Chichester to Silchester which passed below the hill over what is now Green Street and Pookles Lane.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the wetland nature of the Levels, the area {{contains}} a rich biodiversity of national and international importance. It supports a vast variety of plant and bird species and is an important feeding ground for birds and includes 32Sites of Special Scientific Interest, of which 12 are also Special Protection Areas. The <b>area</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> extensively studied for its biodiversity and heritage, and has a growing tourism industry.|$|E
5|$|Covent Garden {{falls within}} the London boroughs of Westminster and Camden and the {{parliamentary}} constituencies of Cities of London and Westminster and Holborn and St Pancras.

5|$|The <b>area</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a {{major focus}} of modern Egyptological {{exploration}} for the last two centuries. Prior to this time it was a site for tourism in antiquity (especially during Roman times). This area illustrates the changes in the study of ancient Egypt, starting as antiquity hunting, and ending as scientific excavation of the whole Theban Necropolis. Despite the exploration and investigation noted below, only eleven of the tombs have actually been completely recorded.|$|E
5|$|The <b>area</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{inhabited}} {{since the}} Stone Age, {{and was a}} centre of ironworking in Roman times. Crawley developed slowly as a market town from the 13th century, serving the surrounding villages in the Weald. Its location {{on the main road}} from London to Brighton brought passing trade, which encouraged the development of coaching inns. A rail link to London opened in 1841.|$|E
5|$|The {{biological}} {{interest is}} focused on the species-rich mesotrophic grassland found across the site, which is actively maintained by grazing. The species present are predominantly grasses, although herbs and orchids are also found. The <b>area</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> classified as MG5 under the British National Vegetation Classification because of the species composition. The site is small and isolated, and therefore requires careful management to avoid damage caused by activity on neighbouring land.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{was built}} {{to the east of}} the fourteenth-century town on a {{slightly}} raised location. The area enclosed within the castle's outer walls was about 2.8ha (7acres), but with outbuildings, other ancillary constructions and orchards, the total <b>area</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> estimated to be at least 8ha (20acres). The walls were constructed with rubble faced with ashlar, and even without their former polished facings the walls are about 3m (10ft) thick.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of the G-spot is typically reported as being about 50 to 80mm (2 to 3in) inside the vagina, on the front wall. For some women, stimulating this area creates a more intense orgasm than clitoral stimulation. The G-spot <b>area</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> described as needing direct stimulation, such as two fingers pressed deeply into it. Attempting to stimulate the area through sexual penetration, especially in the missionary position, is difficult because of the particular angle of penetration required.|$|E
5|$|The recent strong {{economic}} growth and lower unemployment in the Telford <b>area</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> attributed {{to the construction of}} the motorway: unemployment in the 1980s was over 20%, but by 2004 this figure had fallen to 3.3%. The motorway enabled the development of distribution centres in Telford, and industrial estates such as Hortonwood and Stafford Park have provided employment in the area.|$|E

5|$|The site spans 185 {{million years}} of {{geological}} history, coastal erosion having exposed an almost continuous sequence of rock formation covering the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. At different times, this <b>area</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> desert, shallow tropical sea and marsh, and the fossilised {{remains of the}} various creatures that lived here have been preserved in the rocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{surrounding}} <b>area</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> extensively landscaped {{to create}} outdoor learning areas and a wildlife garden. Energy-saving features include photovoltaic panels for electricity and {{ground source heat pump}} for heating. A green roof (a living roof that is partially or completely covered with vegetation {{and a growing}} medium), is used to absorb rainfall and provide insulation. The centre is constructed using timber-frame walls insulated with straw bales.|$|E
5|$|Themes {{from these}} social {{investigations}} {{have been drawn}} out in fiction. Crime, poverty, vice, sexual transgression, drugs, class-conflict and multi-cultural encounters and fantasies involving Jewish, Chinese and Indian immigrants are major themes. Though the <b>area</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> productive of local writing talent, {{from the time of}} Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891) the idea of 'slumming it' in the 'forbidden' East End has held a fascination for a coterie of the literati.|$|E
