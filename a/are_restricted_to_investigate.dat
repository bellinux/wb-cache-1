Restricting caloric and protein intake {{are the two most}} common methods. A pregnant rodent may have their caloric intake reduced up to 30-50% of normal intake. Protein <b>restricted</b> rodents <b>are</b> given 8-9% casein, as opposed to control rats that are fed 20% casein. Micronutrients, such as zinc and iron, may also <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> <b>investigate</b> the effects on offspring. Additionally, rats fed diets lacking or including methyl donors are often used to study the effects of diet on epigenomics, as variations within the methylation of DNA are common means of silencing or expressing genes. [...] Supplementing maternal mice with folic acid, vitamin B12, choline and betaine leads to increased levels of DNA methylation at CpG sites and causes a coat color change. [...] This is an example of epigenetically modifiable loci called a “metastable epiallele”, of which only a few have been identified. The above {{is an example of the}} “agouti” gene locus, whereby the insertion of a transposable element upstream to the Agouti gene is hypermethylated from the supplementation and causes a change in the mice's coat color. Diets containing higher carbohydrate and fat content attempt to mimic typical Western-style diets may also be used in nutriepigenetic studies. [...] Another method used is “catch-up”, where offspring of rats born to mothers subjected to various diets are subsequently cross-fostered to mothers fed normal diets.|$|R

Recent research acknowledges {{the fact that}} brands, despite the differences between B 2 C and business-to-business (B 2 B) contexts, may carry valuable features in B 2 B contexts as well. B 2 B purchasing {{is a combination of}} decisions made by individuals and their decision could many times be influenced by personal- as well as affective- and cognitive factors, although in an organizational setting. This study intended to examine the influence of brands in a B 2 B purchasing context and is delimitated to the definitions made by the European Union (2013) for micro and small-sized enterprises (MSEs). The study <b>was</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> <b>investigate</b> products that <b>were</b> used for certain organizational purposes, e. g. products that are consumed in the daily activities of organizational functions. A distinction was made between highand low involvement purchases. For this study, a research model was based on recognized brand concepts and organizational buying behavior models. The model illustrates the underlying hypothesis that organizational buying behavior is differently affected by brands depending on product involvement. This research used a qualitative approach, using in-depth interviews to retrieve a deeper understanding of human behavior and the underlying reasons behind such behavior. The result implies that substantial organizational buying behavior had ties to purchasers’ individual buying behavior and further implies emotions being a strong factor when the buyer lacks knowledge, motivation or interest in the product. Brand was initially stated to have limited influence on organizational decisions, which at further elaboration turned out to contradict the actual purchasing behavior...|$|R

40|$|A {{review of}} extant {{literature}} reveals various theories on innovation, including technology push, market pull, and an organizational approach. All of these theories {{have been criticized}} for their lack of integration and inapplicability to today’s competitive environment. An integrated view of innovation has emerged that synthesizes the variables in previous approaches. However, the application of this view has <b>been</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> <b>investigating</b> the innovation processes within the computer and manufacturing industries, whereas the biotechnology industry has been ignored. This is despite biotech managers’ well-acknowledged thirst for innovation and the ability of biotech to shape the way we live. The present article contributes to the literature by applying an integrated approach to the biotech industry, thereby extending understanding of innovation management beyond the traditional field of inquiry. An integrated approach is of particular relevance to biotech companies, given the complexities of managing the industry’s long development cycle and intense collaborative activities. In-depth interviews with eight organizations in Maryland formed the basis for an investigation into the challenges of managing the innovation process in biotechnology firms. The findings revealed that biotech entrepreneurs are ill prepared to lead their organizations through several transformations necessary along the product life cycle because of their fixation on a technology-push approach and lack of an understanding of integrated innovation. These leaders also lack the commercialization knowledge necessary to push products to markets, resulting in avoidable delays and loss of productivity. The existing research has dispelled myths associated with biotech. Specifically, it suggests biotech entrepreneurs cannot rely solely on inventions but must invest in a timely application of knowledge to organizational and market forces {{to take full advantage of}} the innovation potential associated with the industry. This article presents a conceptual framework for applying the integrated innovation model to biotech firms and makes the case for incorporating market-oriented mechanisms, building and using appropriate organizational capabilities, developing effective collaborations, and creating parallel interactions as major elements in a general strategy toward the success and improved efficiency of biotech companies. The limitations of current research are discussed, and avenues are highlighted for much-needed future research into the biotech industry...|$|R

It was determined through {{the results of}} the simulation, that by effectively using the bandwidth and incorporating WiMAX on various ships throughout the fleet that the disadvantaged users' ability to obtain the most current situational awareness data in a timely manner would be greatly enhanced. The Defense (DoD) utilizes the Global Information Grid (GIG) to provide the capability for deployed forces to obtain and share information with users dispersed worldwide. In the current US Naval communications architecture, ships within a strike group access services on the GIG predominantly through Satellite Communication (SATCOM) links. Typical SATCOM bandwidths found on small ships range from 256 [...] 512 kbps, while large ships have the capacity for 4 [...] 8 Mbps. While high bandwidth communications are available on large ships, small ships do not have the ability to leverage this bandwidth by dynamically selecting the most capable link available. Consequently, ships do not efficiently utilize the available bandwidth within the strike group limiting the ability for smaller ships to effectively gain access to services on the GIG. There is a need for a US Naval communications architecture that will create the ability for smaller ships to access the high bandwidth communications available on the large decks in order to obtain the most current information that the strike group may possess. Using this new architecture will allow all ships, resident in the strike group, to effectively access services on the GIG such as those provided by the Consolidated Afloat Network Enterprise System (CANES). In providing these services, platforms within the strike group will have the ability to share Service Based Architecture (SBA) information, leverage the most current data that is stored within the strike group and communicate with the external world through the most efficient and capable link. This research document proposes a system that will allow users on small and medium sized US Navy ships to gain access and utilize the much greater communications bandwidth that is available on the large Navy ships. The scope <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> <b>investigating</b> a means <b>to</b> provide disadvantaged users in a naval strike group to share the bandwidth from the larger ships by using technologies that are currently available.

The few methods that take biological pathways or networks into account <b>are</b> either <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> <b>investigating</b> a limited number of predetermined sets of loci, or do not scale to genome-wide settings.

SConES outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in terms of runtime, scales to hundreds of thousands of genetic loci, and exhibits higher power in detecting causal SNPs in simulation studies than existing methods. On flowering time phenotypes and genotypes from Arabidopsis thaliana, SConES detects loci that enable accurate phenotype prediction and that are supported by the literature.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy ofthe University of LutonThe 1909 - 1918 era {{can be regarded as}} the formative years of MIS, as it developed from a small counter-espionage bureau into an established security intelligence agency. MIS had two main roles during this period; counter-espionage, and advising the War Office {{on how to deal with}} the police and the civilian population, particularly aliens. Most of the existing literature tends to focus on the development of MIS as a whole and pays little attention to the six individual branches that constituted MIS by the armistice. Recently released MIS documents in The National Archives (rnA) make it possible to examine MIS at the micro level and set out the intimate workings of its six branches. The study examines the evolution of MIS from its formation in October 1909 to the end of the First World War in November 1918, paying particular attention to three questions. First, what did a map of the structure of the MIS organisation look like and "how" did it develop during these years? Secondly, "why" did it develop as it did? Thirdly, "how effective" was MI 5 throughout this period? MIS began as a one-man affair in 1909, tasked with the limited remit of ascertaining the extent of Gemlan espionage in Britain and an uncertain future. By the armistice MIS's role had expanded considerably and it had begun to develop into an established security intelligence agency, with 844 personnel spread over six branches covering the investigation of espionage, prevention, records, ports and travellers, overseas, and alien workers. This study suggests that the main driver of these developments, if one key factor can be singled out, was the changing perception of the nature of the threat posed by German espionage. However, because some within official circles equated all forms of opposition to Government policy with support for Germany, increasing attention also began to be paid to the possibility that industrial umest, pacifists and others who opposed the Government might actually be being directed by a German "hidden hand". From 1917 onwards MIS's development was driven by a conviction that it had defeated German espionage, such that Germany had switched its efforts to promoting Bolshevism and other forms of umest in order to undermine British society. However, MIS's activities <b>were</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> <b>investigating</b> if there <b>was</b> really any enemy influence behind such things, while Special Branch was to focus on labour unrest generally. This study makes an original and useful contribution to knowledge in three noteworthy respects. First, it sets out probably the most detailed description of MI 5 's organisational structure available. Secondly, it poses the stimulating question of "how to measure" the effectiveness of a counter-espionage agency? Thirdly, it suggests that, contrary to claims that Vemon Kell was an "empire builder" who wanted a greater role in labour intelligence, Kell felt it appropriate that MIS's activities should <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> the investigation of cases of peace propaganda and sedition that arose from enemy activities and did not actually want MIS to assume a broader role in labour intelligence at that time...|$|R
40|$|Briefly: Using a novel (1, 1) superspace {{formulation}} of semichiral sigma models with 4 D target space, we investigate if an extended supersymmetry {{in terms of}} semichirals is compatible with having a 4 D target space with torsion. In more detail: Semichiral sigma models have (2, 2) supersymmetry and Generalized Kähler target space geometry by construction. They can also support (4, 4) supersymmetry and Generalized Hyperkähler geometry, but when the target space is four dimensional indications are that the geometry <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> Hyperkähler. <b>To</b> <b>investigate</b> this further, we reduce the model to (1, 1) superspace and construct the extra (on-shell) supersymmetries there.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{management}} of rural road landscapes using information derived from visual assessments of these landscapes. Visual assessments of landscapes have previously <b>been</b> mainly <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> <b>investigating</b> scenic/aesthetic matters. However the methods used in these assessments seem to be appropriate for assessing other matters and have potential for application in {{the management of}} multi-use resources in rural roadsides. In this thesis, the responses to rood landscapes of three expert groups and a public user group are considered. The expert groups responded to the rural road landscapes with reference to their areas of expertise - landscape architects evaluated for scenic beauty, ecologists for ecological significance and fire experts for fire hazard potential. The public group responded to the landscape scenes for their preference (for a Sunday afternoon recreational drive). Based on these responses, estimation values, which are numerical representations of the importance of landscape scenes relative to each other, are derived. Policies - multiple linear and non-linear regression equations which statistically represent the average responses of each of the groups to various roadside features - are also developed. Policies make explicit the relationship between changes in selected landscape features and groups' responses to those landscapes. As this study has a management focus, only measurable and manageable landscape features of rural road reserves are considered in developing policies. In exploring the application of estimation values and policies {{in the management of}} rural road reserves, the relationship between the responses of individuals and those of the groups to which the individuals belong is examined, using a technique called policy capturing. The results {{of this study indicate that}} for the four main groups, within group differences exist in the way in which group policies can be used to describe people's responses. The results of this study indicate that the average response of the experts accounts for the majority of their group's members' response but this is not the case for the public group. It is also found that, given the same landscape features, the amount of variance (multiple R 2 value) associated with a group's policy was generally larger than that associated with those policies for its individual members. The findings in the present research complement those in non-landscape research, but contrast with the only other landscape research application of policy capturing. Finally, this study shows ways in which information based on the group policies can be used in the management of rural roads. Five theoretical courses of action are <b>investigated</b> with respect <b>to</b> two landscapes - annual burning, annual slashing, tree planting, road widening, and do-nothing. These five courses of action are referred to as management options, and are theoretically applied over ten- and fifty-year planning periods.

40|$|Cells {{react to}} diverse stimuli by expressing {{specific}} receptors that recognize these stimuli and initiate specific signaling pathways that enable a cell {{to change with}} the environment. Downregulation of these signaling receptors represents the most direct method for limiting the magnitude and duration of downstream signal transduction. For cell surface transmembrane receptors, ligand-stimulated endocytosis is a major mechanism by which {{the ability of a}} cell to react <b>to</b> a ligand <b>is</b> <b>restricted.</b> In order <b>to</b> <b>investigate</b> the downregulation of the prolactin receptor (PRLr), we investigated the mechanism and key determinants in the endocytosis and downregulation of PRLr. In Chapter 2, we show that the endocytosis of PRLr is a ligand-induced process which requires the catalytic activity of the constitutively bound Janus kinase Jak 2. In Chapter 3, we show that PRLr is internalized by a clathrin-dependent mechanism which requires phosphorylation of the conserved phosphodegron motif (DS 349 GRGS) at Ser 349 and an active SCFβ-TrCP E 3 ligase complex. Optimal PRLr endocytosis is shown to be achieved via K 63 -linked polyubiquitination of the receptor. In Chapter 4, we show that PRL signaling promotes cell growth in 2 -D and 3 -D culture systems where PRLr levels are increased/stabilized. In Chapter 5, we identify pyruvate kinase M 2 (PKM 2), a glycolytic enzyme whose role in tumorigenesis has been described, to be a novel interactor of PRLr. We show that prolactin (PRL) signaling works to inhibit PKM 2 activity by the propagation of tyrosinephosphorylated proteins. This inhibition of PKM 2 prevents progression through glycolysis and allows PKM 2 to take a pro-tumorigenic role. We show that the interaction between PRL signaling and PKM 2 is required for optimal prolactin-dependent cell growth. In this thesis (model shown in Model 1), we show that there is a defined mechanism of PRLr downregulation which works to limit PRL signaling. If this mode of receptor downregulation is not properly executed, it can result in aberrant signaling whereby prolactin-mediated inhibition of pyruvate kinase M 2 mediates the pro-tumorigenic effect of prolactin. ...|$|R
