Unpolarized light fluxes are sampled at high spectral and directional resolution to provide biconical reflectance and transmittance factors, every nanometer from 500 nm to 880 nm and at 800 source-sensor configurations (four illumination directions by 200 viewing directions covering the whole sphere). From these calibrated measurements we derive the leaf Bidirectional Reflectance and Transmittance Distribution Functions (BRDF and BTDF). The angular-integrated quantities defined as the Directional Hemispherical Reflectance and Transmittance Function (DHRF and DHTF) are also calculated.

40|$|International audienceThe {{eruption}} of calciocarbonatites at Earth’s surface {{is at odds}} with them being equilibrated with the mantle at depth because high-pressure experimental studies predict that significant magnesium contents should be expected. Here we report on new high-pressure experiments that demonstrate extreme calcium enrichment of carbonatites en route to the surface. We have monitored the decompression of partially molten carbonated peridotite using <b>a</b> multianvil <b>apparatus</b> <b>coupled</b> to synchrotron radiation. The experimental charge was molten at high pressure and high temperature, before being decompressed along a path that avoided the so-called “carbonate ledge” (a boundary that prevents carbonatitic melts from reaching the surface). Reaction with clinopyroxene yields calcium enrichment and magnesium depletion. The resulting Ca/(Ca + Mg) of the quenched melt reaches 0. 95, which compares well with the composition of erupted calcic carbonatites [Ca/(Ca + Mg) ∼ 0. 96 – 0. 99] and of calcic melts trapped in mantle xenoliths from ocean islands [Ca/(Ca + Mg) ∼ 0. 84 – 0. 97]. Our results demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} bring carbonatites very close to the surface, without breakdown, and therefore without catastrophic CO 2 release. Such occurrence appears to be favored by hot geotherms, meaning that higher temperatures tend to stabilize carbonatitic melts at shallow mantle pressure. Carbonatitic magmas are usually associated with low temperatures, because of the assumed low melting degree or low eruption temperature of the only active carbonatite volcano (i. e., Oldoinyo Lengai, Tanzania). Here we show that emplacement of carbonatites at or near the surface necessitates a hot environment...|$|R

To accomplish picks up here, we have tested the traditional speculation connected with powertrain capacities and plans. Ordinary powertrain arrangements comprise of an inner burning motor working over an extensive variety of torque and pace conditions and a transmission that has, by examination, just <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of discrete <b>apparatus</b> proportions.

Utilizing a CVT-arranged powertrain, the motor works at greatest burden conditions. This permits the motor to work at or close to its best brake particular fuel utilization rate, which implies that the motor is working at its most elevated normal adiabatic efficiencies. For inner ignition motors this would be 36 %, while for diesel motors it is 45 %.

For this purpose, we compared the establishment of the excitation-contraction coupling mechanism in myotubes differentiated in four different experimental paradigms: 1) aneurally cultured, 2) cocultured with fetal rat spinal cord explants, 3) aneurally cultured in medium conditioned by cocultures, and 4) aneurally cultured in medium supplemented with purified recombinant chick neural agrin. Ca 2 + imaging indicated that coculturing human muscle cells with rat spinal cord explants increased the fraction of cells showing <b>a</b> functional excitation-contraction <b>coupling</b> mechanism. The effect of spinal cord explants was mimicked by treatment with medium conditioned by cocultures or by addition of 1 nM of recombinant neural agrin to the medium. The treatment with neural agrin increased the number of human muscle cells in which functional ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type Ca 2 + channels were detectable. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that agrin, released from neurons, controls the maturation of the excitation-contraction coupling mechanism and that this effect is due to modulation of both RyRs and L-type Ca 2 + channels. Thus, a novel role for neural agrin in skeletal muscle maturation is proposed...|$|R
