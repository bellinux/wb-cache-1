50|$|Most {{aviation}} piston <b>engines</b> are air-cooled. <b>Air</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> are {{lighter than}} their major alternative - water <b>cooled</b> <b>engines,</b> because the lower weight of <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> in aircraft design being {{a more important}} factor than the lower drag of water <b>cooled</b> <b>engines.</b> While water <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> were widely used {{from the early days}} of flight, <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> were the dominant choice in aircraft.

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>Cooled</b> <b>Engines</b> {{have been}} used in a variety of applications, ranging from {{airplanes}} to motorbikes and even stationary or portable engines. Since modern automobiles and airplanes use engines delivering more power, they have to be cooled more efficiently due to which a more complex water cooling system is used for <b>cooling</b> <b>engines</b> with large displacements.

40|$|Thermal {{energy flow}} within the piston of an <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>engine</b> was {{investigated}} {{by measuring the}} heat flux in the engine cylinder liner {{in the region of}} travel of the piston rings. Engine sump oil temperature and oil viscosity were varied to change the piston ring heat flow by altering the oil film between the cylinder wall and piston ring. Engine load was varied to change heat flow into the piston. Also, the crankcase oil splash cooling of the piston was varied to change heat flow leaving the piston. When sump oil temperature was reduced, more heat flowed to the cooler sump. Changes in oil viscosity had little effect on the cylinder wall heat flow but increased cylinder wall temperature due to an increase in frictional heating with lower oil viscosity. It was thus determined that this change in heat flow was due to the change in sump oil temperature and was not due to a change in oil film characteristics. A decrease in engine load decreased the average temperature and heat flux in the cylinder wall. The largest decrease in heat flux was on the exhaust side of the engine where the largest fraction of cylinder heat is convected to the external airflow. It was found that the change in heat flux caused by the decrease in engine load was likely due to a change in the piston ring pack heat flow. For changes in the crankcase oil splash cooling of the piston, there were only small changes in average temperature and no changes in the heat flux. Although the piston was still believed to lose heat to the crankcase oil splash, its percentage of piston heat loss was too small to affect piston ring pack heat flow. Superposition was evaluated for sump oil temperature and engine load as well as sump oil temperature and oil viscosity. In both cases, significant error was found with the linear superposition assumption. Linear superposition was assumed not to hold for these complex heat flows...|$|E

40|$|Presently, the {{research}} on the homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines has gained importance {{in the field of}} automotive power applications due to its superior efficiency and low emissions compared to the conventional internal combustion (IC) engines. In principle, the HCCI uses premixed lean homogeneous charge that auto-ignites volumetrically throughout the cylinder. The homogeneous mixture preparation is the main key to achieve high fuel economy and low exhaust emissions from the HCCI engines. In the recent past, different techniques to prepare homogeneous mixture have been explored. The major problem associated with the HCCI is to control the auto-ignition over wide range of engine operating conditions. The control strategies for the HCCI engines were also explored. This dissertation investigates the utilization of ethanol, a potential major contributor to the fuel economy of the future. Port fuel injection (PFI) strategy was used to prepare the homogeneous mixture external to the engine cylinder in a constant speed, single cylinder, four stroke <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>engine</b> which was operated on HCCI mode. Seven modules of work have been proposed and carried out in this research work to establish the results of using ethanol as a potential fuel in the HCCI engine. Ethanol has a low Cetane number and thus it cannot be auto-ignited easily. Therefore, intake air preheating was used to achieve auto-ignition temperatures. In the first module of work, the ethanol fueled HCCI engine was thermodynamically analysed to determine the operating domain. The minimum intake air temperature requirement to achieve auto-ignition and stable HCCI combustion was found to be 130 °C. Whereas, the knock limit of the engine limited the maximum intake air temperature of 170 °C. Therefore, the intake air temperature range was fixed between 130 - 170 °C for the ethanol fueled HCCI operation. In the second module of work, experiments were conducted with the variation of intake air temperature from 130 - 170 °C at a regular interval of 10 °C. It was found that, the increase in the intake air temperature advanced the combustion phase and decreased the exhaust gas temperature. At 170 °C, the maximum combustion efficiency and thermal efficiency were found to be 98. 2...|$|E
40|$|Biomass syngas {{needs to}} be cooled before being usable in a {{conventional}} spark- ignition engine, {{in order to avoid}} knock. The tar impurities of raw biomass syngas condense due to this cooling process, which leads to the clogging and subsequent damage of critical process parts. Thus, in addition to cooling, the syngas {{needs to be}} purified of the tars, which adds to the cost and complexity of the gasification power plant. A novel technique is being investigated where the syngas temperature is kept above the tar dew point (about 250 ◦C) throughout the process, and thus, tar condensation and its related problems can potentially be avoided. A Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine is suitable for such an application. The objective of this thesis is to experimentally study HCCI combustion with biomass syngas at intake temperatures above the tar dew point. Chapter 1, reviews the broad context of gasification and the associated tar impurities, where it argues that the SI engine, due to its limited intake temperature flexibility, significantly contributes in the making of tars into problematic compounds. The novel method of using the HCCI engine at intake temperatures above the tar dew point is introduced, along with listing the multiple challenges foreseen with such an approach. Of these challenges, two are identified which forms the main experimental works described in this thesis. The test bench, which includes a 435 cc single-cylinder <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>engine,</b> and the associated instruments are discussed in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 discusses the various post processing methods used during this work which computes the rate of heat release from the raw in-cylinder pressure data, along with a host of other parameters. Thereafter, the main experimental works are described in Chapters 4, 5 and 6. In a real-world scenario, the syngas composition varies with time. To understand the HCCI combustion in response to such variations, studies with artificial syngas compositions were carried out, as described in Chapter 4. In these experiments, the time component was omitted and the focus was on determining the impacts of various possible syngas compositions as well as operating conditions on the HCCI combustion. It was found that increasing H 2 content of syngas advanced the combustion which lead to the undesirable pressure ringing (equivalent to knock in SI engines). At an intake temperature of 250 ◦C and intake pressure of 1. 2 bar, a maximum IMEP of 2. 8 bar and an Indicated Efficiency (IE) of 35 % could be attained with dry and pure syngas compositions. Since the raw syngas would also contain water and tars, the effects of these components were studied. Syngas moisture dampened the HCCI combustion, thus improving the IMEP potential. Two representative tar com- pounds (naphthalene and toluene) were used and it was observed that tars, due to their high heating values and higher heat capacities, had positive effects on HCCI combustion. Additionally, the effects of intake pressure and temperature were also studied with the conclusion that high intake pressures and low intake temperatures improved the engine performance. Since the HCCI engine lacks a direct control method, studies were carried out to explore the use of Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) as a control method, as discussed in Chapter 5. EGR was found to successfully delay the combustion initiation and thus, in combination with the equivalence ratio which advanced the combustion, an effective HCCI control method for this context was demonstrated. An improvement in the maximum IMEP from 2. 8 bar at EGR= 0, to 3. 3 bar at EGR= 25 % was achieved, a significant gain of about 25 %. Studies with real syngas were carried out to investigate the effect of time variations in the syngas composition, as discussed in Chapter 6. Syngas from a two-stage downdraft gasifier was used in its cooled and purified form so as to reduce the complexity of the process and form a basis for future hot syngas experiments. Two experiments were carried out with time durations of 3 hours and 24 hours. For the 3 hours experiments, the gasifier was in a transient stage (warming up) and thus supplied syngas with a lower heating value. Decent HCCI combustion stability was observed which is interesting {{in the light of the}} highly sensitive nature of the HCCI combustion. For the 24 hours test, the gasifier was operating at its designed conditions, resulting in a higher heating value syngas. During the 24 hours test, the engine combustion was not stable and wide variations were observed. Additionally, high amounts of NOx emissions were recorded. The reasons for both the cyclic instabilities and high NOx could not be confirmed, however, some hypotheses are proposed. Finally, Chapter 7 concludes the findings of this thesis and reflects on the advantages and limitations of the concept as well as on the limitations of this thesis. Planned works following this thesis in the near and distant future are listed. (FSA - Sciences de l'ingénieur) [...] UCL, 201...|$|E
