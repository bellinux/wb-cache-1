While neither catecholamine nor protein secretion from secretory granules were altered, the depolarization-induced acetylcholine release from SLMVs was no longer calcium-dependent. We propose that within the exocytotic process of SLMVs, there exist two depolarization-induced steps. One is calcium-dependent and no longer present in synaptotagmin <b>I-</b> <b>and</b> II-deficient cells. The other is induced by depolarization, does not require calcium, and suffices to trigger neurotransmitter release from SLMVs in synaptotagmin <b>I-</b> <b>and</b> II-deficient PC 12 cells...|$|R
40|$|Several {{subsurface}} water plumes are {{found at the}} Hanford U. S. DOE site. These plumes contain {{many different types of}} hazardous components including radioactive iodate (IO 3 -) and iodide (I-), which may have deleterious health effects. To selectively uptake IO 3 - <b>and</b> <b>I-,</b> inorganic layered double hydroxide (LDH) compounds were synthesized and tested. LDHs are mixed transition metal hydroxides that contain positively charged layers that undergo anion exchange. When LDHs are submerged in the plume water, they can selectively uptake IO 3 - <b>and</b> <b>I-</b> and remove them from the plume. Raman spectroscopy was used to monitor the uptake of IO 3 - <b>and</b> <b>I-.</b> The thermodynamic properties of the LDHs were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), where a phase transition was observed in the thermogram of each LDH compound. The thermodynamic properties describe the temperature range where the LDH compounds are stable and uptake the highest concentration of IO 3 - <b>and</b> <b>I-.</b> Raman spectroscopy indicated which LDH compounds were the most selective for IO 3 -. Further experiments will be performed to determine IO­ 3 - <b>and</b> <b>I-</b> sorption of LDH compounds in groundwater. Similar technology can then be applied to radioactive waste where interferences from other compounds are present...|$|E

This is advantageous for using a simple scatter and crosstalk correction method like our five energy window method (FiveEW method).
