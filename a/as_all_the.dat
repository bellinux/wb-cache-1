5|$|<b>As</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{stars of}} a {{globular}} cluster are at {{approximately the same}} distance from us, their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about the same amount. The main-sequence stars in the globular cluster will fall along a line that {{is believed to be}} comparable to similar stars in the solar neighborhood. The accuracy of this assumption is confirmed by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, such as RR Lyrae stars and cepheid variables, with those in the cluster.|$|E
5|$|As may be {{observed}} in the table below, the main limiting factor in the precision of the Avogadro constant is the uncertainty {{in the value of}} the Planck constant, <b>as</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other constants that contribute to the calculation are known more precisely.|$|E
5|$|Georgia's jury {{votes in}} the Grand Final were all {{declared}} invalid, <b>as</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> jury members had voted exactly the same from 3 points up to 12 points. According to EBU, this constitutes a statistical impossibility. Therefore, only Georgia's televoting result {{was used for the}} distribution of the Georgian points in the Grand Final.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1016 Basil II led his armies along the Struma valley and besieged the strong {{fortress}} of Pernik. The fort's defence was headed by the capable commander Krakra, who remained loyal to the Bulgarian cause. <b>As</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> previous attempts against Pernik, the 88-day siege was a failure, costing the Byzantines many casualties before {{they were forced to}} retreat south and regroup at Mosynopolis.|$|E

The music for Lightning Bolt has a harder rock sound with longer songs to contrast predecessor Backspacer (2009), and the lyrics convey singer Eddie Vedder's feelings on aging and mortality.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{features}} Frank Welker <b>as</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{animals in}} Africa.

Following its broadcast, the episode received mixed reviews from critics. The episode was also nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series in 2001, which it ultimately lost.|$|E

5|$|The region {{continued}} to be contested throughout the High Middle Ages as the Republic of Venice started to expand its influence and territory, gradually pushing back Croatia, which {{had been in a}} personal union of Croatia and Hungary since 1102. By 1420, Venice controlled Istria and Dalmatia, as well <b>as</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Kvarner Gulf islands except Krk. The island became a part of the realm in 1481, but Venice never captured the region's mainland, which would have entirely linked Venetian possessions in the eastern Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|The {{town has}} had a council since 1292, when it was granted a {{constitution}} under the Holy Roman Empire.

Its council currently comprises 33 councillors, whose number is defined by law according {{to the size of}} the population. The town also has a mayor elected by the councillors.|$|E

5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} {{close to the}} giant planets, comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations. Short-period comets have a tendency for their aphelia to coincide with a giant planet's semi-major axis, with the JFCs being the largest group. It is clear that comets {{coming in from the}} Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets {{as a result of a}} close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being more than twice as massive <b>as</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other planets combined. These perturbations can deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.|$|E
5|$|Cave Story {{has been}} ported to Linux, AROS, MorphOS, AmigaOS 4 and Mac OS X {{operating}} systems, PlayStation Portable, Xbox, Dreamcast, Sega Genesis, GP2X, GP2X Wiz, and the TI graphing calculator. An enhanced port, featuring updated character designs, remixed music and extra game modes, {{was developed by}} Nicalis and released on WiiWare on 22 March 2010 in North America and 10 December 2010 in Europe. Nicalis also ported the game to DSiWare on 29 November 2010 in North America and 22 November 2011 in Japan. Although it does not feature the enhanced graphics and sound {{or some of the}} extra modes from the Wii version, it does include the Sanctuary Attack mode. There is also a free/libre SDL-based recreation of the original game engine, titled NXEngine, made by programmer Caitlin Shaw, which allows for extended modification of the game, and the creation of ports for additional devices. The game was released for the Nintendo 3DS's Nintendo eShop service (separate from the retail 3DS game) in the United States on 4 October 2012 and in Europe on 1 May 2014. This version includes the DSiWare version's Jukebox mode, as well <b>as</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> additional modes included in Cave Story+.|$|E
5|$|Filming resumed on August 3, 2006 at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah for 70 {{days off}} the California coast, <b>as</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{shooting}} {{required in the}} Caribbean had been conducted in 2005. Davy Jones's Locker was shot at Utah, and it was shot in a monochromatic way to represent its different feeling from the usual colorful environment of a pirate. The climactic battle was shot in a former air hangar at Palmdale, California, where the cast had to wear wetsuits underneath their costumes on angle-tipped ships. The water-drenched set was kept in freezing temperatures, to make sure bacteria did not come inside and infect the crew. A second unit shot at Niagara Falls. Industrial Light & Magic did 750 effects shots, while Digital Domain also took on 300. They spent just five months finishing the special effects. The film posed numerous challenges in creating water-based effects.|$|E

5|$|Finnair {{terminated}} {{their services}} to Kirkenes in 1975. At {{the same time}} the ministry and SAS started looking at the airport structure in Finnmark, <b>as</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> services in the county were in need of subsidies. The proposals were either for a hike in the ticket prices or a reduction of Kirkenes to a regional-only airport. SAS was flying a 90-seat aircraft two to three times per day between Kirkenes and Alta with only ten to fifteen passengers. The airport structure was kept, but ticket prices continued to rise. The airport served 110,000 passengers in 1983. Norving continued Varangfly's air ambulance contract until 1987, when the service was taken over by Air Express. Later the contract was awarded to Lufttransport, who operated the Beechcraft Super King Air. Norving filed for bankruptcy in 1992 and their routes were taken over by Widerøe.|$|E
5|$|Firefighters were {{confident}} that the remaining fires could be extinguished during the dayTuesday 13 December. The smoke plume had been considerably reduced and was more grey, indicating the amount of vapourised water now combining with the smoke. It was reported at 16:45 that all tank fires had been extinguished, although some smaller fires persisted. 75% of firefighters for Hertfordshire were involved in fighting the fire, supported by 16other brigades. The entire gold command operation, involving many agencies as well <b>as</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> emergency services, was run from Hertfordshire Constabulary's headquarters in Welwyn Garden City, {{some distance from the}} fire.|$|E
5|$|Giampaolo Caruso led {{the group}} into Ans and towards the {{climb to the}} finish.

He opened his sprint from a long way out, with Joaquim Rodríguez (Katusha) right behind him. Rodríguez slowed as they approached the line, however, and Valverde took the victory. Julian Alaphilippe came around Rodríguez in the final metres to take second place.|$|E
