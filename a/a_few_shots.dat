5|$|In 2012, Panthulu's son Ravishankar {{revealed}} that <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>shots</b> involving Ganesan and Rama Rao took {{as many as}} four days to shoot, because of the large number of personnel involved. After the release of Karnan, all the chariots specially made for the war sequences in Kurukshetra, were donated to the Brihadeeswarar Temple in Thanjavur.|$|E
5|$|The {{center of}} both lines was engaged, but {{the level of}} damage and {{casualties}} suffered was noticeably less. Ships in the rear squadrons were almost entirely uninvolved; Admiral Hood reported that three of his ships fired <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>shots.</b> The ongoing conflicting signals left by Graves, and discrepancies between his and Hood's records of what signals had been given and when, led to immediate recriminations, written debate, and an eventual formal inquiry.|$|E
5|$|Biehn was hastily cast a {{week after}} filming had commenced, and thus was not present for the {{military}} training that the other actors playing marines went through James Remar was originally cast as Hicks but left the project over creative differences with Cameron. In an interview on episode #128 of the Sidebar podcast, Remar stated that he was replaced due to being fired after {{he was arrested for}} drug possession. Only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>shots</b> of him remain in the film, which is where the team first enters the alien hive, only his back is seen. This was because those sequences were too expensive to re-shoot.|$|E

5|$|Signs of {{a strong}} Viet Cong and North Vietnamese {{presence}} were detected {{almost as soon as}} 3 RAR began its sweep, while the blocking elements also had a number of sightings, and a few contacts with small parties moving north. Possibly alerted by allied air and road movements, the communists seemed to be avoiding open combat. Late on the afternoon of 6 June 5 Platoon, B Company located what was thought to be the main communist position, however with nightfall approaching, it was decided not to press the attack that night. During the evening <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>shots</b> were exchanged between the Australians and Viet Cong, and the Australian platoon subsequently withdrew into a night harbour.|$|E
5|$|The boat chase {{was another}} scene that {{required}} very little CGI. Machine FX worked on replacing <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>shots</b> of visible stuntmen {{with a digital}} version of Craig's head, and recreated the boats Bond jumps over on his motorcycle {{to make it look}} more dangerous. Crowd creation was done for the Tosca scene by Machine FX, to make the performance look like it had sold out. Forster edited the opera scene to resemble The Man Who Knew Too Much. In total, there are 900+ visual effects shots in Quantum of Solace.|$|E
5|$|The {{visual effects}} supervisor, John Sullivan, hired Arc Productions to create just under 500 shots with {{computer}} generated imagery, between a quarter {{and a third}} of what a blockbuster film would feature. The Covenant that appear are all completely computer generated, as is the academy's space elevator, weapons' muzzle flashes and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>shots</b> of Master Chief. Hendler felt that the visual effects were the area that needed particular focus and spent a much larger percentage of the budget on the Master Chief costume and computer generated imagery than is normal for a production.|$|E

5|$|On June 28, Washington {{learned that}} the British fleet had set sail from Halifax on June 9 and were heading toward New York. On June 29, signals were sent from men {{stationed}} on Staten Island, indicating that the British fleet had appeared. Within a few hours, 45 British ships dropped anchor in Lower New York Bay. Less than a week later, there were 130 ships off Staten Island {{under the command of}} Richard Howe, the brother of the general. The population of New York went into panic {{at the sight of the}} British ships; alarms went off and troops immediately rushed to their posts. On July 2, British troops began to land on Staten Island. The continental regulars on the island took <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>shots</b> at them before fleeing, and the citizens' militia switched over to the British side.|$|E
5|$|Braham and Walsh {{scrambled}} {{free of the}} Mosquito and {{hid behind}} a sand dune. As they did so the aircraft's fuel tanks exploded. The Fw 190 pilot flew over at 20 feet {{and for a moment}} they believed he was going to fire upon them. To their relief he waved and flew by. They contemplated escape but instantly German soldiers were running towards them. They had crash-landed near to a radar station and the enemy soldiers were at the crash site very quickly. The Germans fired <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>shots</b> in their direction but none hit them. They were captured and searched. The Germans found a Mauser pistol which Braham had taken from a crashed German bomber. It was not well received by his captors. Braham believed they might attack him and he had thought about grabbing the gun, fighting it out with the German guards, finding a friendly Dane and making it to Sweden somehow. The tension eased when he was taken to a barracks and offered some synthetic German coffee. Soon a pair of Luftwaffe officers arrived and escorted him to a cell on an airfield near Esjberg.|$|E
5|$|For the live-action {{portion of}} the production, Bakshi and his cast and crew went to Spain, where the {{rotoscope}} models acted out their parts in costume. During {{the middle of a}} large shoot, union bosses called for a lunch break, and Bakshi secretly shot footage of actors in Orc costumes moving toward the craft service table, and used the footage in the film. Many of the actors who contributed voices to this production also acted out their parts for rotoscoped scenes. The actions of Bilbo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee were performed by Billy Barty, while Sharon Baird served as the performance model for Frodo Baggins. Other performers used on the rotoscoping session included John A. Neris as Gandalf, Walt Robles as Aragorn, Felix Silla as Gollum, Jeri Lea Ray as Galadriel and Aesop Aquarian as Gimli. Although some cel animation was produced and shot for the film, very little of it appears in the final film. Most of the film's crowd and battle scenes use a different technique, in which live-action footage is solarized (per an interview with the film's cinematographer, Timothy Galfas, in the documentary Forging Through the Darkness: the Ralph Bakshi Vision for The Lord of the Rings) to produce a more three-dimensional look. In <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>shots</b> the two techniques are combined.|$|E

60|$|The two crabs {{were now}} {{placed in the}} most {{extraordinary}} position. The overhang of their roofs prevented an attack on their hulls by the Llangaron, but their unmailed hulls were so greatly exposed that <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>shot</b> from another ship could easily have destroyed them. But as any ship firing at them would be very likely to hit the Llangaron, their directors felt safe on this point.|$|R
5|$|On 10 January 1913, Asar-i Tevfik {{supported}} another sortie by the fleet, {{this time}} patrolling off the Dardanelles {{while the rest}} of the fleet raided Imbros. While protecting the fleet's flank, she encountered Greek destroyers and forced them to withdraw after firing <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>shots.</b> Neither side scored any hits in the engagement. The ship was lost while operating in the Black Sea against Bulgarian forces. On 7 February, the ship was ordered to proceed to Yalıköy to support a raid by the Army. The following day, the raid was launched on the town, but was quickly forced to withdraw from heavy Bulgarian resistance; Asar-i Tevfik was ordered to move in and shell the town, but ran aground on an uncharted sandbank at 12:45. On 10 February, salvage work began, beginning with the removal of equipment. By the 12th, all armament and coal had been removed, but the ship could not be freed. Heavy seas and Bulgarian artillery damaged the wreck, which rendered her a total loss.|$|E
5|$|Reso {{made his}} {{debut in the}} Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) {{promotion}} on November 13, 2005 at TNA's Genesis PPV event under his old ring name Christian Cage. Cage then made his way the ring, where he grabbed a microphone and announced his intentions to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship held by Jeff Jarrett, after taking <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>shots</b> at his former employer. Coach Scott D'Amore and Bobby Roode of the villainous Team Canada alliance then {{made their way to}} the ring. D'Amore then offered Cage a position in Team Canada (since Reso is Canadian) and even giving him a Team Canada T-shirt and telling Cage to take his time on making a decision. Later in the night after the main event, a six-man tag team match pitting the team of Jarrett and America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) (AMW) against Rhino and Team 3D (Brother Ray and Brother Devon), Cage ran down to the ring while Team Canada (D'Amore, Roode, Eric Young, and A-1), AMW, and Jarrett were assaulting Rhino and Team 3D. After Cage entered the ring, he removed the jacket he was wearing to reveal the Team Canada T-shirt he was given earlier by D'Amore. D'Amore immediately rejoiced that Cage was seemingly a member of Team Canada until Cage turned on D'Amore and performed his Unprettier maneuver; Cage's act also solidified his character as a face. Cage, Rhino, and Team 3D attacked AMW and Team Canada and threw them out of the ring; they then forced the remaining Jarrett through a wooden table after Cage removed his Team Canada shirt to reveal a hidden TNA T-shirt.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} mainly shot on Kodak Vision3 250D film stock. Scenes where Oscar is alive were {{shot in the}} super 35 format with Arricam LT cameras, and the rest in super 16 with an Aaton XTR Prod. The cinematographer was Benoît Debie, who also shot Irréversible. As in Irréversible, Noé was {{reluctant}} to use artificial lighting that would destroy the illusion if the camera was turned around. Thanks to Tokyo's many neon signs, very little additional lighting was required for the exterior scenes, {{despite the fact that}} many were shot late at night. For the interior scenes Debie mainly used practical, in-frame light sources. Some exceptions were made. One was that the moods of the characters were meant to be indicated by different colours, ranging from orange to purple with occasional greens. For this, Debie used a set of red, green, and blue programmable disco lights, which allowed for all different hues. The disco lights were easy to hide. They were also used for simulation of neon flashes, and to add a tint of red to the dressing-room scenes. Another exception was the use of strobe lights, which were programmed together with the coloured lights. Blue colour was avoided throughout, since the filmmakers did not associate it with dreams. Noé was the film's camera operator, except for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>shots</b> of Oscar running in the streets, as they required a taller cameraman. In those scenes, the camera was held by Debie.|$|E

5|$|The team {{tries to}} call for further assistance, but find the radio is no longer working. Randall heads outside to check the power transformers, and is {{attacked}} by a large creature (Ross Sturlin) hiding in the underbrush around the station. Randall fires <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>shots</b> at the creature with his pistol and escapes unscathed. Although {{he did not get}} a good look at the creature, he describes it to the rest of the team as similar in size to a bear. Later, the team finds the infirmary has been trashed and Corcoran's body is gone. They initially believe the creature has broken in and stole the corpse, but are shocked to instead find Corcoran has mysteriously regained consciousness. Upon checking his blood again, there is no trace of the mysterious cells from before, but after investigating Corcoran's body, they find the cells have changed into lizard-like fetuses and entered into his abdominal cavity. The creature later breaks into the lab again, this time beheading Dr. Wyman. Randall and Dunlap are initially suspicious that Corcoran was involved in the death, which he denies, but it appears he has some sort of telepathic connection with the creature. Despite Wyman's death, Corcoran does not believe the creature is evil, but rather simply misunderstood. He implores the others to give the creature a chance to explain its actions, and asks that they not condemn it as a monster simply because it is different.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} on June 8, Frémont's men {{encountered}} the Confederate advanced guard near Cross Keys Tavern. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>shots</b> were fired and the Union cavalry fell back onto their main body, which was approaching. Darkness prevented further developments.|$|E
25|$|After {{about half}} an hour, at 11:30 p.m., Thapa and three of his colleagues {{returned}} to the temple grounds. He fired <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>shots</b> in the air, before shooting indiscriminately {{at the people who}} were trying to seek refuge within the temple from the gunman.|$|E

25|$|The Pinkertons {{attempted}} to land {{under cover of}} darkness about 4 a.m. A large crowd of families had kept pace with the boats as they were towed by a tug into the town. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>shots</b> were fired at the tug and barges, but no one was injured. The crowd tore down the barbed-wire fence and strikers and their families surged onto the Homestead plant grounds. Some in the crowd threw stones at the barges, but strike leaders shouted for restraint.|$|E
25|$|Scenes shot {{afterwards}} included various live-action {{shots of}} Riders for the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and a reaction shot of Serkis as Gollum finally realises Frodo intends {{to destroy the}} Ring, shot in Jackson's house. For the Extended DVD, in March 2004 Jackson created <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>shots</b> of skulls rolling over for the avalanche scene; this was the final piece of footage ever shot for the trilogy, and Jackson noted {{that it must be}} the first time a director had shot scenes for a film after it had already won the Oscar.|$|E
25|$|By now, {{the water}} under Entreprenantes keel {{was less than}} three fathoms (5 m) and Williams was obliged to tack.

She was the Spanish brig St. Joseph (San Jose), out of Cadiz and Gibraltar, and had been captured whilst sailing to Tarragona. Williams took her in tow and sailed her out of the harbour. Hundreds of spectators on the mole head at Málaga watched the action. Entreprenante accomplished the entire engagement without taking any casualties. This was to be Entreprenantes last action.|$|E
