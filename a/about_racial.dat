25|$|In 1946, Lee {{played a}} {{principal}} role in On Whitman Avenue, a drama <b>about</b> <b>racial</b> prejudice directed by Margo Jones. Lee produced the play, {{making him the}} first African-American producer on Broadway.

25|$|A social thriller is {{a motion}} picture genre using {{elements}} of suspense to augment attention to abuses {{of power and}} instances of oppression in society. The genre gained notoriety in 2017 {{with the release of}} Jordan Peele's Get Out, a film <b>about</b> <b>racial</b> microaggressions that veil a plot to abduct young African-Americans. Prior to Peele, other film actors, directors and critics had used the term to describe an emerging genre of cinema with examples from all over the globe.|$|E
25|$|Senators management, {{seemingly}} uneasy <b>about</b> <b>racial</b> matters, were latecomers to integrating their team, hiring {{their first}} black player {{in late summer}} of 1954. The segregationist policy of the Redskins was more overt and controversial. In October 1957, a group of blacks picketed multiple times in front of Griffith Stadium, protesting the lack of black players on the Redskins. It would be five more years before the Redskins finally began employing black players, the last NFL team to erase the color line.|$|E
25|$|In {{the post}} Apartheid South Africa, Afrikaners {{were not as}} worried <b>about</b> <b>racial</b> {{integration}} for netball and rugby as they were about the integration of their schools. In Afrikaner schools, teachers are expected to coach rugby or netball, or another sport on offer by the school. Soccer became the de facto sport of choice in South Africa. This was made possible because of the participation {{of women in the}} game, which enabled greater community support. Netball became more of a sport for working class women.|$|E

25|$|The {{depiction}} of Dana’s white husband, Kevin, also serves {{to examine the}} concept of racial and gender privilege. In the present, Kevin seems unconscious of the benefits he derives from his skin pigmentation {{as well as of}} the way his actions serve to disenfranchise Dana. Once he goes to the past, however, he must not just resist accepting slavery as the normal state of affairs, but dissociate himself from the unrestricted power white males enjoy as their privilege.His prolonged stay in the past transforms him from a naive white man oblivious <b>about</b> <b>racial</b> issues into an anti-slave activist fighting racial oppression.|$|E
25|$|Historian Horst Drechsler {{states that}} there was {{discussion}} {{of the possibility of}} establishing and placing the Herero in native reserves and that this was further proof of the German colonists' sense of ownership over the land. Drechsler illustrates the gap between the rights of a European and an African; the German Colonial League held that, in regards to legal matters, the testimony of seven Africans was equivalent to that of a colonist. Bridgman writes <b>about</b> <b>racial</b> tensions underlying these developments; the average German colonist viewed native Africans as a lowly source of cheap labour, and others welcomed their extermination.|$|E
25|$|In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court {{struck down}} the {{impositions}} {{of the death penalty}} in each of the consolidated cases as unconstitutional in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court has never ruled the death penalty to be per se unconstitutional. The five justices in the majority did not produce a common opinion or rationale for their decision, however, and agreed only on a short statement announcing the result. The narrowest opinions, those of Byron White and Potter Stewart, expressed generalized concerns about the inconsistent application of the death penalty across a variety of cases, but did not exclude the possibility of a constitutional death penalty law. Stewart and William O. Douglas worried explicitly <b>about</b> <b>racial</b> discrimination in enforcement of the death penalty. Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan Jr. expressed the opinion that the death penalty was proscribed absolutely by the Eighth Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment.|$|E

He advocated against high tariffs and bounties, claiming that industries that could not withstand free trade were [...] "not entitled to much consideration at [...] hands". He was also a vigorous supporter of the White Australia policy, advocating the cessation of Kanaka immigration and the gradual deportation {{of those who had}} already arrived in Queensland; his opposition was based on a concern that [...] "inferior labour would ... tend to degrade labour throughout the Commonwealth", as well as concerns <b>about</b> <b>racial</b> purity.|$|E
500|$|Since 1992 Paul Kelly {{has had a}} solo career, fronted the Paul Kelly Band, {{and worked}} in {{occasional}} collaborations with other songwriters and performers.

Kelly took the role of a petrol attendant when the play premiered at the Adelaide Fringe Festival that year and was directed by his wife, Fairfax. Kelly co-wrote [...] "Hey Boys" [...] with Mark Seymour (Hunters & Collectors) for the soundtrack of the 1992 Australian film, Garbo; when released as a single it peaked at No.62. Kelly contributed songs and vocals to the soundtrack of the 1993 television series Seven Deadly Sins.|$|E
500|$|Born in 1926, Harper Lee {{grew up in}} the Southern town of Monroeville, Alabama, {{where she}} became close friends with soon-to-be famous writer [...] Truman Capote. She {{attended}} Huntingdon College in Montgomery (1944–45), and then studied law at the University of Alabama (1945–49). While attending college, she wrote for campus literary magazines: Huntress at Huntingdon and the humor magazine Rammer Jammer at the University of Alabama. At both colleges, she wrote short stories and other works <b>about</b> <b>racial</b> injustice, a rarely mentioned topic on such campuses at the time. In 1950, Lee moved to New York City, where she worked as a reservation clerk for British Overseas Airways Corporation; there, she began writing a collection of essays and short stories about people in Monroeville. Hoping to be published, Lee presented her writing in 1957 to a literary agent recommended by Capote. An editor at J. B. Lippincott, who bought the manuscript, advised her to quit the airline and concentrate on writing. Donations from friends allowed her to write uninterrupted for a year.|$|E

500|$|In {{his book}} Somebody Scream!: Rap Music's Rise to Prominence in the Aftershock of Black Power, Marcus Reeves said that Fear of a Black Planet [...] "was {{as much a}} musical assault on America's racism {{as it was a}} call to blacks to {{effectively}} react to it". According to Greg Kot, the album was [...] "hardly a black power manifesto for world domination, but a statement <b>about</b> <b>racial</b> paranoia. Though he spares virtually no one with his withering raps, Public Enemy's Chuck D is harshest of all on his fellow blacks, expounding on everything from history to fashion: Use your brain instead of a gun. Drugs are death. Know your past so you won't screw up the future. Gold chains worn around the neck demean the brotherhood in South Africa." [...] Kot wrote of Chuck D's perspective and the theme of fear, [...] "It's fear that divides us, he says; understand me better and you won't run. Fear of a Black Planet is about achieving that understanding, but on Public Enemy's terms. In presenting their view of life from an Afro-centric, as opposed to Euro-centric, perspective, P.E. challenges listeners to step into their world." ...|$|E
500|$|Lecrae {{has also}} contributed op-ed {{articles}} to Billboard dealing with {{race relations in}} the United States, including the 2014 Ferguson unrest, 2015 Charleston church shooting, and 2016 shootings of Alton Stirling, Philando Castile, and six Dallas police officers. In these articles, Lecrae has called for understanding and empathy across racial divides and willingness {{to listen to the}} oppressed, and also pointed out the need for spiritual healing through Jesus Christ. In mid 2016, Lecrae did a talk <b>about</b> <b>racial</b> reconciliation at Yale University, titled [...] "Knowledge through Narrative: Bridging the Racial Divide in America". He also spoke on hip hop culture at a Nashville TEDx conference, decrying the misogyny and violence rampant in much of hip hop's lyrics but advocating for hip hop to be used as an agent for social change. At the 2016 BET Hip Hop Awards, Lecrae performed an original composition addressing racial injustice in the United States, referencing the shooting of Philando Castile. On October 20, 2016, Lecrae wrote in The Huffington Post that he has been struggling with depression and doubt, which was partly caused by the backlash he received from many American evangelicals who are critical of his public stance on race-related issues.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone writer Rob Sheffield wrote [...] "nobody else {{is making}} music this daring and weird" [...] and {{described}} the song as [...] "spooky space funk". The Washington Posts Chris Richards stated [...] "West's moment of post-Beatles anxiety comes during 'Gorgeous,' a song that moans and groans with a dark urgency that permeates this album." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Simon Vozick-Levinson described the song as [...] "narcissistic" [...] and noted West's insults of his critics in the song. Alex Denney of NME praised West's sense of humor on the song and praised the guitar work. Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine called West's first verse on the song a [...] "bilious rant <b>about</b> <b>racial</b> inequality". AbsolutePunk's Drew Beringer stated that West sounded angry on the song, and viewed that it contained {{some of his best}} lyrics. Andrew Barber of Complex stated that the track had several quotable lines, and commented that West was a [...] "frontrunner" [...] for hip-hop's best producers and rappers combinations. Barber called Cudi's hook excellent, and mused that the [...] "guitar riff on the beat will stay stuck in your head for days." [...] The song charted at 23 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart as reported by Billboard, however it only spent one week on the chart. The song also appeared on the South Korean Gaon Chart at 86.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, the Civil Rights Movement was {{gathering}} {{momentum in the}} U.S. when Fordham students and school officials expressed ambivalence <b>about</b> <b>racial</b> justice. In the late 1960s, Fordham became a center of political activism and countercultural activity. At the Rose Hill Campus, the Fordham branch of Students for a Democratic Society organized opposition {{to the existence of}} the ROTC and military recruiters. During this period, students routinely organized protests and class boycotts and used psychoactive drugs on campus open spaces. In response to internal demands for a more [...] "liberalized" [...] curriculum, the university created Bensalem College in 1967. An experimental college with no set requirements and no grades, it was studied by a wide array of educators and reported on by such large-circulation publications of the day as Look, Esquire and the Saturday Review. The school closed in 1974. In 1969, students organized a sit-in on the main road leading to Rose Hill in response to an announcement President Richard Nixon would be speaking on campus. As a result of the sit-in, Nixon was forced to cancel his plans to speak. A year later, students stormed the main administration building, occupying it for several weeks, and set fire to the Rose Hill faculty lounge. It was during this period of activism the university's African and African American Studies Department, one of the first black studies departments in the nation, as well as the paper, the leftist student newspaper on campus, were founded.|$|E
500|$|The lead single [...] "Fight the Power" [...] {{features}} revolutionary rhetoric by Chuck D and {{was used}} by director Spike Lee as a leitmotif in his acclaimed 1989 film Do the Right Thing, a film <b>about</b> <b>racial</b> tension in a Brooklyn neighborhood. Lee approached the group in 1988 {{after the release of}} It Takes a Nation with the proposition of making a song for his movie. Chuck D wrote most of the song trying to adapt The Isley Brothers' [...] "Fight the Power" [...] to a modernist perspective. The song's third verse contains disparaging lyrics about popular American icons Elvis Presley and John Wayne, as Chuck D rhymes [...] "Elvis was a hero to most / But he never meant shit to me' / Straight up, racist the sucker was / Simple and plain", with Flavor Flav following, [...] "Muthafuck him and John Wayne!". The lyrics were shocking and offensive to many listeners upon the single's release. Chuck D's lyrics express the identification of Presley with racism—either personally or symbolically—and the largely held notion among Blacks that Presley, whose musical and visual performances owed much to African-American sources, unfairly achieved the cultural acknowledgment and commercial success largely denied his black peers in rock and roll. The line regarding John Wayne refers to his controversial personal views, including racist remarks made in his 1971 interview for Playboy. [...] "Fight the Power" [...] has since become the group's best-known song and has been named one of the best songs of all time by numerous publications.|$|E
500|$|Jeffrey Jerome Cohen {{proposes that}} the story is <b>about</b> <b>racial</b> difference, and [...] "allows William to write obliquely about the Welsh": the green {{children}} are a memory of England's past and the violent conquest of the indigenous Britons by the Anglo-Saxons followed by the Norman invasion. William of Newburgh reluctantly includes {{the story of the}} green children in his account of a largely unified England, which Cohen juxtaposes with Geoffrey of Monmouth's The History of the Kings of Britain, a book that according to William is full of [...] "gushing and untrammeled lying". Geoffrey's history offers accounts of previous kings and kingdoms of various racial identities, whereas William's England is one in which all peoples are either assimilated or pushed to the boundaries. According to Cohen, the green children represent a dual intrusion into William's unified vision of England. On one hand they are a reminder of the racial and cultural differences between Normans and Anglo-Saxons, given the children's claim to have come from St Martin's Land, named after Martin of Tours; the only other time William mentions that saint is in reference to [...] in Hastings, which commemorates the Norman victory in 1066. But the children also embody the earlier inhabitants of the British Isles, the [...] "Welsh (and Irish and Scots) who [...] forcibly anglicized... The Green Children resurface another story that William had been unable to tell, one in which English paninsular dominion becomes a troubled assumption rather than a foregone conclusion." [...] The boy in particular, who dies rather than become assimilated, represents [...] "an adjacent world that cannot be annexed... an otherness that will perish to endure".|$|E
