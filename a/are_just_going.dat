500|$|... "Greatest Hits" [...] {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} for married couple Rose and Bernard since the late second season and fans welcomed the recurring characters' return. [...] The writers cited the actors' other projects {{as a reason for}} their absence. [...] Additionally, it was feared that fans would complain if they appeared, when many actors with star billing had received limited screentime in the early third season. [...] The writers also commented that {{they do not want to}} have the couple on the show if they <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> to be standing in the background; they want to have Rose and Bernard in the show with interesting storylines.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the band's reunion, Lytle noted, [...] "The bargain I {{made myself}} {{regarding}} the 'brief reunion and couple of shows' situation was that I wasn't gonna {{talk too much}} about it. I was just gonna stew on it, and then do it. That's {{the good thing about}} festivals. No need for me to sell anything here. Get in, rock out, get paid, get out. There <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> to be a few shows. Festival-type thingies. Perhaps the odd 'warm up gig' in someone's hair salon or something. Money was a motivating factor (resurfacing my indoor tennis court, oil change for my 4×4 Ferrari) but the idea of playing and hanging out with each other is something all of the guys are pretty stoked about." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{announcing the}} change, Tiley said Plexicushion {{would have a}} [...] "lower rubber content than Rebound Ace, was firmer under foot and {{retained}} less heat through its thinner top layer." [...] Tiley later said that the change of colour, from green to blue, would also benefit players and officials, although this change was quite arbitrary. The manufacturers of Rebound Ace derided the new surface, with director Paul Bull saying that, [...] "We had an Australian icon event with a unique Australian product and now we <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> to become a clone of the U.S. Open." [...] Bull {{also said that the}} inconsistencies in pace were down to the organizers' imperative, who kept asking for the pace to be adjusted to pander for certain players, such as Hewitt. Bull, however, conceded that a change was needed; and said that the suggestion of a Rebound Ace court with a rubber mat thickness of around 5mm was made.|$|E

2500|$|Mattis {{believes}} that Iran {{is the principal}} threat to {{the stability of the}} Middle East, ahead of Al-Qaeda and ISIS. Mattis says: [...] "I consider ISIS nothing more than an excuse for Iran to continue its mischief. Iran is not an enemy of ISIS. They have a lot to gain from the turmoil in the region that ISIS creates." [...] On the Iran nuclear deal, although he sees it as a poor agreement, he believes there is now no way to tear it up, saying: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> to have to recognize that we have an imperfect arms control agreement. Second, that what we achieved is a nuclear pause, not a nuclear halt". Mattis argues that the nuclear inspections may fail to prevent Iran from seeking to develop nuclear weapons, but that [...] "f nothing else at least we will have better targeting data if it comes to a fight in the future." ...|$|E
