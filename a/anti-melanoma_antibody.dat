The presence and {{position of the}} acetyl group were estimated by one- and two-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance, and fast atom bombardmentmass spectrometries. In addition, the O-acetyl showed higher immunological activity toward <b>anti-melanoma</b> <b>antibody</b> {{in the presence of}} non-acetylated GM 3 in complement-dependent liposome lysis than did non-acetylated or acetylated GM 3 alone in the liposome, suggesting enhancement of immunological reactivity of the intact tumor cells by a small amount of O-acetyl GM 3...|$|E
40|$|Cell-surface localizing {{heterologous}} antibodies {{against the}} mouse EL 4 lymphoma and a human malignant melanoma could be bound to chlorambucil without causing {{the loss of}} the alkylating activity of chlorambucil or interfering with the reactivity of the antibodies with their respective tumour cells. When given to mice preinoculated with tumour cells 2, 24, 72, and 120 hours before the beginning of treatment the chlorambucil-bound antibody was a much more effective tumour inhibitor than chlorambucil or the antibody alone. In a patient with disseminated malignant melanoma injection of the chlorambucil-bound <b>anti-melanoma</b> <b>antibody</b> first locally into a few metastatic nodules and then by the intravenous route was followed by the regression of all the metastatic nodules...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} an {{anti-human}} transferrin receptor (anti-TFR) monoclonal antibody (MoAb), designated B 3 / 25, and an <b>anti-melanoma</b> <b>antibody,</b> designated 96. 5, on the uptake of gallium- 67 (67 Ga) by tumor was studied. Three groups of six athymic mice bearing a human melanoma were injected via tail vein with (a) 0. 55 mg human serum albumin (HSA) (control group), (b) 0. 5 mg MoAb B 3 / 25 + 0. 55 mg HSA, and (c) 0. 5 mg MoAb 96. 5 + 0. 55 mg HSA, respectively. Twenty-four hours later, each mouse {{was given an}} intravenous dose of 5 fid [67 Ga] citrate. Biodistribution of activity (percent injected dose per gram) determined 48 hr after injection of 67 Gashowed a 75 % decrease in tumor uptake {{in the group of}} mice that received B 3 / 25 (anti-TFR MoAb) compared with the control group. In contrast, MoAb 96. 5 did not show any effect on melanoma uptake of 67 Ga. Histologie findings suggest that the decreased uptake was not due to cellular damage resulting from binding of B 3 / 25 to TFR. The results of this study strongly suggest the involvement of TFR in the in vivo tumor uptake of 67 Ga. J NucÃ-Med 28 : 1303 - 1307, 1987 U/ptake of gallium- 67 (67 Ga) citrate by soft-tissu...|$|E
40|$|The {{reactivity}} {{spectrum of}} five different monoclonal <b>anti-melanoma</b> <b>antibodies</b> cross-reacting with gliomas and neuroblastomas and one monoclonal anti-glioma antibody cross-reacting with melanomas and neuroblastomas was investigated. Comparison of the binding activity of these monoclonal antibodies for 11 melanoma, seven glioma, and three neuroblastoma cell lines showed {{that each of}} these clones had a different pattern of cross-reactivity. The results indicated that the antigenic determinants detected by these antibodies were not associated with the same antigen and thus suggested the existence of at least six different antigens common to melanomas, gliomas, and neuroblastomas. Since all these tumors are known to derive from cells originating embryologically from the neural crest, it can be assumed that the antigens recognized by our monoclonal antibodies are neuroectodermal differentiation antigens. However, absorption with fetal brain homogenates abolished only the binding of monoclonal anti-glioma antibody, but did not modify the binding of monoclonal <b>anti-melanoma</b> <b>antibodies...</b>|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the structures of}} three distinct human melanoma surface antigens detected by monoclonal <b>anti-melanoma</b> <b>antibodies.</b> One antigen, expressed on all melanoma cells and on certain astrocytoma cells but not on {{any other kind of}} normal or tumor cell tested, has been shown to consist of our associated polypeptide chains. A second antigen expressed on many but not all melanomas has been identified as the antigenic product of the HLA-D locus, the DR antigen.

40|$|Fusion phage {{libraries}} expressing single-chain Fv antibodies {{were constructed}} from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of two melanoma {{patients who had}} been immunized with autologous melanoma cells transduced the gamma-interferon gene to enhance immunogenicity, in a trial conducted at another institution. <b>Anti-melanoma</b> <b>antibodies</b> were selected from each library by panning the phage against live cultures of the autologous tumor. After two or three rounds of panning, clones of the phage were tested by ELISA for binding to the autologous tumor cells; > 90 % of the clones tested showed a strong ELISA reaction, demonstrating {{the effectiveness of the}} panning procedure for selecting antimelanoma antibodies. The panned phage population was extensively absorbed against normal melanocytes to enrich for antibodies that react with melanoma cells but not with melanocytes. The unabsorbed phage were cloned, and the specificities of the expressed antibodies were individually tested by ELISA with a panel of cultured human cells. The first tests were done with normal endothelial and fibroblast cells to identify antibodies that do not react, or react weakly, with two normal cell types, indicating some degree of specificity for melanoma cells. The proportion of phage clones expressing such antibodies was approximately 1 %. Those phage were further tested by ELISA with melanocytes, several melanoma lines, and eight other tumor lines, including a glioma line derived from glial cells that share a common lineage with melanocytes. The ELISA tests identified three classes of <b>anti-melanoma</b> <b>antibodies,</b> as follows: (i) a melanoma-specific class that reacts almost exclusively with the melanoma lines; (ii) a tumor-specific class that reacts with melanoma and other tumor lines but does not react with the normal melanocyte, endothelial and fibroblast cells; and (iii) a lineage-specific class that reacts with the melanoma lines, melanocytes, and the glioma line but does not react with the other lines. These are rare classes from the immunized patients' repertoires of <b>anti-melanoma</b> <b>antibodies,</b> most of which are relatively nonspecific anti-self antibodies. The melanoma-specific class was isolated from one patient, and the lineage-specific class was isolated from the other patient, indicating that different patients can have markedly different responses to the same immunization protocol. The procedures described here can be used to screen the antibody repertoire of any person with cancer, providing access to an enormous untapped pool of human monoclonal anti-tumor antibodies with clinical and research potential...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} cell surface {{molecules}} with specificity to tumour cells {{have been identified}} and monoclonal antibodies (mAb) {{to some of these}} antigens have been used for targeting tumour cells in vivo. We have sought to link the powerful effector mechanisms of cytotoxic T-cells with the specificity of mAb, by targeting recombinant HLA class I molecules to tumour cells using an antibody delivery system. Soluble recombinant MHC class I/peptide complexes including HLA-A 2. 1 refolded around an immunodominant peptide from the HIV gag protein (HLA-A 2 /gag) were synthesized, and the stability of these complexes at 37 °C was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a conformation-specific antibody. MHC class I-negative lymphoma cells (Daudi) were labelled with a biotinylated mAb specific for a cell surface protein (anti-CD 20) then linked to soluble biotinylated HLA-A 2 /gag complexes using an avidin bridge. Flow cytometry revealed strong labelling of lymphoma cells with HLA-A 2 /gag complexes (80 -fold increase in mean channel fluorescence). CTL specific for HLA-A 2 /gag efficiently lysed complex-targeted cells, while control CTL (specific for an HLA-A 2. 1 -restricted epitope of melan-A) did not. Similarly, SK-mel- 29 melanoma cells were also efficiently lysed by HLA-A 2 /gag-specific CTL when HLA-A 2 /gag complexes were linked to their surface via the HMW-MAA specific <b>anti-melanoma</b> <b>antibody</b> 225. 28 s. With further consideration to the in vivo stability of the MHC class I/peptide complexes, this system could prove a new strategy for the immunological therapy of cancer. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|E
40|$|Evidence has {{accumulated}} since 1967 indicating {{the importance of}} the immune system in malignant melanoma. Morton et al. 's initial work described tumorassociated antigens in human malignant melanoma using immunofluorescent techniques (1). These were soon confirmed and extended by others. Further work showed that these tumor-specific antigens elicit the production of circulating humoral antibodies in 60 % of patients with malignant melanoma (Table 1). Only 20 % of normal patients had these antibodies, which may have been the result of their surveillance mechanism identifying and destroying these tumors. Surveillance is the mechanism by which the host immune system, either by the T-cell lymphocytes or by circulating antibodies, seeks out and destroys what it identifies as foreign to the host. Furthermore, there appeared to be a correlation between the clinical status of the melanoma patients and the incidence of <b>anti-melanoma</b> <b>antibodies</b> in their sera. Patients with localized melanoma {{were more likely to have}} antibody in their sera than those patients with disseminated disease (2). Some patients who were observed through their course had the antibody disappear from their ser...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of melanoma-associated antigens (MAA) being limited to normal melanocytes and melanomas, MAAs are ideal targets for immunotherapy and melanoma vaccines. As MAAs {{are derived from}} self, immune responses to these may be limited by thymic tolerance. The extent to which self-tolerance prevents efficient immune responses to MAAs remains unknown. The autoimmune regulator (AIRE) controls the {{expression of}} tissue-specific self-antigens in thymic epithelial cells (TECs). The level of antigens expressed in the TECs determines the fate of auto-reactive thymocytes. Deficiency in AIRE leads in both humans (APECED patients) and mice to enlarged autoreactive immune repertoires. Here we show increased IgG levels to melanoma cells in APECED patients correlating with autoimmune skin features. Similarly, the enlarged T cell repertoire in AIRE(-/-) mice enables them to mount anti-MAA and anti-melanoma responses as shown by increased <b>anti-melanoma</b> <b>antibodies,</b> and enhanced CD 4 (+) and MAA-specific CD 8 (+) T cell responses after melanoma challenge. We show that thymic expression of gp 100 is {{under the control of}} AIRE, leading to increased gp 100 -specific CD 8 (+) T cell frequencies in AIRE(-/-) mice. TRP- 2 (tyrosinase-related protein), on the other hand, is absent from TECs and consequently TRP- 2 specific CD 8 (+) T cells were found in both AIRE(-/-) and AIRE(+/+) mice. This study emphasizes the importance of investigating thymic expression of self-antigens prior to their inclusion in vaccination and immunotherapy strategies...|$|R
40|$|The low cost, high versatility, and {{reliable}} production of bacterially produced recombinant antibody fragments speeds up {{the development of}} tumor-targeting agents. High-quality recombinant <b>anti-melanoma</b> <b>antibodies</b> are much sought after in the scientific community. We cloned the murine antibody 225. 28 S, currently used in radioimmunoimaging of human melanoma lesions, in single-chain Fv configuration (scFv) for soluble expression in bacteria. The recombinant antibody fragment conserved the binding specificity of the parental antibody. In order to arm the scFv(225. 28 S) with biologically useful effector functions, we developed vectors for soluble expression of scFv(225. 28 S) in bacteria that allow both covalent and noncovalent chemical antibody modification at positions that do not interfere with antigen binding. An expression vector was developed that appends a cysteine residue at the C-terminal extremity of the recombinant antibody, thus allowing reaction with thiol-specific reagents, including 99 mTc labeling, at a position that does not interfere with antigen binding. The scFv(225. 28 S) was also successfully expressed with a casein kinase II substrate tag that enables efficient and stable 32 P labeling. For noncovalent antibody modification, we developed an expression vector that appends the human calmodulin gene at the C-terminal extremity of scFv(225. 28 S). The calmodulin domain is poorly immunogenic {{and can be targeted}} with chemically modified high-affinity calmodulin ligands. The recombinant anti-human melanoma antibodies described in this article should prove useful “building blocks” for the development of anti-melanoma diagnostic and therapeutic strategies...|$|R

The paired-label study {{was performed by}} injecting simultaneously 131 I-labelled control (F(ab') 2 -fragments. The patients were scanned by computerised tomoscintigraphy. After surgery, the activities of 125 I and 131 I were counted in tumour and normal tissues. The results indicate {{that there was a}} low but definite uptake of the antibody in the tumour due to its specificity.

40|$|Using a {{panel of}} seven cell markers, we studied the value of immunocytochemical {{labelling}} in the histological diagnosis of desmoplastic malignant melanoma. Sections from routine formalin-fixed tissue of 45 surgical specimens were obtained from 25 cases of malignant melanoma that showed well-marked desmoplastic or neurotropic features. Routinely stained sections (Haematoxylin-and -eosin and melanin stains) were compared with the following panel of seven antibodies: S- 100, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), vimentin, factor XIIIa (FXIIIa), desmin and the newer, supposedly more specific <b>anti-melanoma</b> <b>antibodies</b> HMB 45 and NKIC 3. S- 100 and NSE were the most sensitive antibodies for desmoplastic malignant melanoma with strong labelling of spindle cells in most cases. In contrast, results for NKIC 3 were more variable; results were negative in nearly half the tumours, but strong labelling was seen in six cases (27 %). Positive labelling for HMB 45 was noted in five tumours (22 %); it was mostly confined to small groups of cells in the superficial part of the lesions. Tumour spindle cells were negative for FXIIIa in all cases; there was no {{increase in the number}} of positive dermal dendritic cells compared to conventional and spindle cell melanoma. All tumours were desmin-negative, but most were vimentin-positive. Our findings indicate that immunocytochemistry is of less value in the diagnosis of desmoplastic malignant melanoma that it is with other types of malignant melanoma. However, positive or negative labelling for S- 100 protein and NSE is useful for suggesting or excluding a diagnosis of desmoplastic malignant melanoma; neither marker is specific and, in particular, positive labelling is also found in most neurofibromas and benign cellular naevi. NKIC 3 and HMB 45 label desmoplastic malignant melanoma much less consistently than other conventional malignant melanomas...|$|R
40|$|Autoradiography of nude mice bearing human {{malignant}} melanoma xenografts {{was performed to}} characterize the distribution pattern of radioiodinated <b>anti-melanoma</b> monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> (MoAb) and fragments in macroscopic tumor modules. Non-uniformity of radioactivity distribution was seen in all MoAb-xenograft combinations. The predominant patterns were marked deposition of radioactivity either in the periphery of nodules or in sharply delimited intra-tumoral foci. These patterns were generated by limitations in the accessibility of melanoma tissue rather than gross necrosis or heterogeneity of antigen expression. Computer-aided densitometry of autoradiograms was used to elaborate the difference of accumulation in intra-tumoral hot spots versus cold areas. It was found that increasing uniformity was achieved by increasing the dose of MoAb (i. e., intact IgG) injected, whereas {{a reduction in the}} size of MoAb (IgG> F(ab') 2 > Fab) showed no such effect...|$|R

The first group of IS {{was performed in}} 50 patients before surgery to assess optimal management: seven true positive and one true negative were obtained in ocular and visceral melanomas, while in cutaneous MM sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in assessing lymph node involvement were, respectively, 61. 5, 93. 3 and 83. 7 %. The second group of 128 IS is relative to 85 patients in follow-up: excluding 13 cases with known metastatic disease and 12 inconclusive tests, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were, respectively, 83. 3, 98. 8 and 96. 1 %.

40|$|Tenascin {{is a large}} {{glycoprotein}} of the extracellular matrix. It shows a site-restricted expression during embryogenesis and can {{be found}} in adult tissues during wound healing and tumorigenesis. Because of the potential involvement of tenascin in adhesion and invasion during metas tasis, the study of the interactions of tumor cells with tenascin is of considerable interest. Using five <b>anti-melanoma</b> monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> to four different epitopes of human tenascin, we found that most mela noma cells secrete tenascin in vitro constitutively. Transforming growth factor fi, in the medium increased secretion in tenascin-producing cells. Tenascin was present in sera of melanoma patients, with significantly elevated levels in patients with advanced melanomas as compared to patients with low tumor burden or to normal donors. Normal and malig nant melanocytes did not attach to tenascin as substrate within 1 to 2 h and tenascin could also inhibit fibronectin-dependent adhesion. These results indicate that tenascin may {{play a critical role in}} cell-substrate interactions of melanoma cells...|$|R
40|$|Our research, {{inspired}} by the pioneering works of Isaac Witz in the 1980 s, established that 40 % of human metastatic melanomas express ectopically inhibitory Fc gamma receptors (FcRIIB), while they are detected on less than 5 % of primary cutaneous melanoma and not on melanocytes. We demonstrated that these tumoral FcRIIB act as decoy receptors that bind the Fc portion of antimelanoma IgG, which may prevent Fc recognition by the effector cells {{of the immune system}} and allow the metastatic melanoma to escape the humoral/natural immune response. The FcRIIB is able to inhibit the ADCC (antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity) in vitro. Interestingly, the percentage of melanoma expressing the FcRIIB is high (70 %) in organs like the liver, which is rich in patrolling NK (natural killer) cells that exercise their antitumoral activity by ADCC. We found that this tumoral FcRIIB is fully functional and that its inhibitory potential can be triggered depending on the specificity of the anti-tumor antibody with which it interacts. Together these observations elucidate how metastatic melanomas interact with and potentially evade humoral immunity and provide direction for the improvement of <b>anti-melanoma</b> monoclonal <b>antibody</b> therapy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Metastatic and chemoresistant {{melanoma}} {{can be a}} good {{target of}} immunotherapy because it is an intractable cancer with a very poor prognosis. Previously, we tested a dendritic cell (DC) -based phase I vaccine, and confirmed that it was safe. In the present study, we performed a phase II trial of a DC vaccine for metastatic melanoma patients with mainly the HLA-A 24 genotype, and investigated the efficacy of the vaccine. Twenty-four patients with metastatic melanoma were enrolled into a phase II study of DC-based immunotherapy. The group included 19 HLA-A 24 -positive (A* 2402) patients and 3 HLA-A 2 -positive (A* 0201) patients. The protocol for DC production was similar to that in the phase I trial. Briefly, a cocktail of 5 melanoma-associated synthetic peptides (gp 100, tyrosinase, MAGE-A 2, MAGE-A 3 and MART- 1 or MAGE-A 1) restricted to HLA-A 2 or A 24 and KLH were used for DC pulsing. Finally, DCs were injected subcutaneously (s. c.) into the inguinal region in the dose range of 1 - 5 x 107 per shot. The DC ratio (lin-HLA-DR+) of the vaccine was 38. 1 ± 13. 3 % and the frequency of CD 83 + DCs was 25. 7 ± 20. 8 %. Other param-eters regarding DC processing were not different from phase I. Immune response-related parameters including the ELISPOT assay, DTH reaction to peptide or KLH, DC injection numbers were shown to be related to a good prognosis. The ELISPOT reaction was positive in 75 % of the patients vaccinated. The increase of <b>anti-melanoma</b> antigen <b>antibody</b> titer before vaccination was also shown to be a prognosis factor, but that post-vaccination was not. Based on immunohistochemical analysis, CD 8 and IL- 17 were not involved in the prognosis. Adverse effects of more than grade III were not seen. Overall survival analysis revealed a significant survival prolongation effect in DC-given melanoma patients. These results suggest that peptide cocktail-treated DC vaccines may be a safe and effective therapy against metastatic melanoma in terms of prolongation of overall survival time...|$|R
