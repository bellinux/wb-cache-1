5|$|Left without <b>any</b> <b>family,</b> Morales {{headed for}} Antofagasta, then a port town in Bolivia that was booming {{due to the}} nitrate mines in the area. She {{travelled}} there as a steerage passenger, with a ticket she bought by selling nearly all of her possessions. While working there, she met Santiago Pizarro, a Chilean in his 30s who made his living in a Bolivian military band, and married him in mid-1878, aged 13. He was tried and executed on 21 September of that year for killing a Bolivian soldier in a drunken brawl. She found his body dumped {{by the side of}} the railway tracks and took a gold ring from his finger, which she wore for the rest of her life. Pizarro's execution was widely protested by the mostly Chilean population of Antofagasta, which resented what was seen as an unjust Bolivian government.|$|E
5|$|William Thomas Stearn {{was born}} at 37 Springfield Road, Chesterton, Cambridge, England, on 16 April 1911, the eldest of four sons, to Thomas Stearn (1871/2–1922) and Ellen ("Nellie") Kiddy (1886–1986) of West Suffolk. His father worked as a coachman to a Cambridge doctor. Chesterton was then a village on the north bank of the River Cam, about two miles north of Cambridge's City Centre, where Springfield Road ran {{parallel}} to Milton Road to the west. William Stearn's early education was at the nearby Milton Road Junior Council School (see image). Despite not having <b>any</b> <b>family</b> background in science (though he recalled that his grandfather was the university rat-catcher) he developed {{a keen interest in}} natural history and books at an early age. He spent his school holidays on his uncle's Suffolk farm, tending cows grazing by the roadside where he would observe the wild flowers of the hedgerows and fields. Stearn's father died suddenly in 1922 when William was only eleven, leaving his working-class family in financial difficulties since his widow had no pension.|$|E

5|$|Chinese kinship {{relations}} {{during the}} Han {{were influenced by}} Confucian mores and involved both immediate nuclear family and extended family members. The Chinese family was patrilineal, since a father's sons did not consider a mother's kin {{to be part of}} their clan; instead, they were considered 'outside relatives'. The Han dynasty law code inherited the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE) law that <b>any</b> <b>family</b> with more than two sons had to pay extra taxes. This was not repealed until the Cao Wei period (220–265 CE). The average Han family under one household typically had about four or five immediate family members, which was unlike the large extended families under one household in later dynasties. It was common during Han to send adult married sons away with a portion of the family fortune and visit them occasionally, yet in all dynasties during and after the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE), a son who moved away and lived separately from his living parents would be considered a criminal. Larger families appeared during the Eastern Han when some married brothers chose to live with each other's families. However, a household with three generations living under its roof was incredibly rare. This is in contrast to the Jin dynasty (265–420), when having three or more generations under one roof was commonplace.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Chamberlain became {{deeply involved in the}} war effort. In addition to his duties as councillor, Chamberlain helped recruit men for the Royal Warwickshire Regiment and set up funds for injured soldiers. Late in 1914, he became an alderman of Birmingham, and the following year, became Lord Mayor. Chamberlain's biographer, Robert Self, suggested that as Joseph Chamberlain had died the previous year, the honour was due to Neville Chamberlain's hard work rather than to <b>any</b> <b>family</b> influence. As a Lord Mayor in wartime, Chamberlain had a tremendous burden of work, and he insisted that his councillors and officials work equally hard. He set up crèches for workers, stockpiled coal to be distributed to the poor at cost in time of shortage, and reinvigorated Birmingham's various committees, which were ineffective and engaged in wasteful rivalries. He also chaired the local committee evaluating exemptions from conscription, and stated that he was more lenient than were other members of the tribunal. He halved the Lord Mayor's expense allowance, and cut back on the number of civic functions expected of the incumbent.|$|E
