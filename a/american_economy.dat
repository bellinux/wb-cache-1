5|$|Educational {{attainment}} varied greatly {{depending on}} occupational field with 68% {{of those in}} the professional and professional support fields having a bachelor's degree or higher, compared to only 31.6% of those employed in sales and 11.6% {{of those in the}} service sector. Considering the fact that the average American does not have a bachelor's degree, he or she is most likely employed in the service, sales, and office support fields with many working in the professional support and business fields as well. All together the <b>American</b> <b>economy</b> and labor force have changed greatly since the middle of the 20th. century with most workers today being employed in office and service occupations.|$|E
5|$|Smuggling off American coasts was {{an issue}} before the Revolutionary War, and after the Revolution it was more problematic. Along with smuggling, lack of {{shipping}} control, pirating, and a revenue unbalance were also major problems. In response, Hamilton proposed to Congress to enact a naval police force called revenue cutters in order to patrol the waters and assist the custom collectors with confiscating contraband. This idea was also proposed to assist in tariff controlling, boosting the <b>American</b> <b>economy,</b> and promote the merchant marine. It is thought that his experience obtained during his apprenticeship with Nicholas Kruger was influential in his decision-making.|$|E

5|$|In September 2010, China {{temporarily}} blocked all {{exports of}} rare earths to Japan {{in the midst}} of a diplomatic dispute between the two countries. These minerals are used in hybrid cars and other products such wind turbines and guided missiles, thereby augmenting the worries about the dependence on Chinese rare-earth elements and the need for geographic diversity of supply. A December 2010 report published by the US DoE found that the <b>American</b> <b>economy</b> vulnerable to rare-earth shortages and estimates that it could take 15 years to overcome dependence on Chinese supplies. China raised export taxes for some rare earths from 15 to 25%, and also extended taxes to exports of some rare-earth alloys that were not taxed before. The Chinese government also announced further reductions on its export quotas for the first months of 2011, which represent a 35% reduction in tonnage as compared to exports during the first half of 2010.|$|E
5|$|Rapid {{economic}} development {{during the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists. Tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie led the nation's progress in railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became {{a major part of}} the economy, with J. P. Morgan playing a notable role. Edison and Tesla undertook the widespread distribution of electricity to industry, homes, and for street lighting. Henry Ford revolutionized the automotive industry. The <b>American</b> <b>economy</b> boomed, becoming the world's largest, and the United States achieved great power status. These dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements. This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms in many societal areas, including women's suffrage, alcohol prohibition, regulation of consumer goods, greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions.|$|E
5|$|The California Gold Rush (1848–1855) {{began on}} January 24, 1848, when gold {{was found by}} James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California.

The sudden influx of {{immigration}} and gold into the money supply reinvigorated the <b>American</b> <b>economy,</b> and California became one of the few American states to go directly to statehood without first being a territory, in the Compromise of 1850. The Gold Rush had severe effects on Native Californians and resulted in a precipitous population decline from disease, genocide and starvation. By the time it ended, California had gone from a thinly populated ex-Mexican territory to the home state of the first nominee for the Republican Party.|$|E

5|$|While {{economic}} policies were the original motivating {{factor in the}} growing partisan split, foreign policy also became a factor. Though most Americans supported the French Revolution prior to the Execution of Louis XVI, some of Hamilton's followers began to fear the radical egalitarianism of the revolution as it became increasingly violent. Washington particularly feared British entrance into the war, as he worried that sympathy for France and hatred for Britain would propel the United States into the French Revolutionary Wars, to the ruin of the <b>American</b> <b>economy.</b> In 1793, after Britain entered the French Revolutionary Wars, several Democratic-Republican Societies were formed. These societies, centered {{on the middle class}} of several eastern cities, opposed Hamilton's {{economic policies}} and supported France. Conservatives came to fear these societies as populist movements that sought to re-make the class order. That same year, the British began attacking American ships that were trading with France, fanning the flames of anti-British sentiment. As Washington continued to seek peace with Great Britain, critics finally began to attack the president himself.|$|E
5|$|With that said, honeybees perform {{some level}} of {{pollination}} of nearly 75% of all plant species directly used for human food worldwide. Catastrophic loss of honeybees could have significant impact, therefore; {{it is estimated that}} seven out of the 60 major agricultural crops in North <b>American</b> <b>economy</b> would be lost, and this is only for one region of the world. Farms that have intensive systems (high density of crops) will be impacted the most compared to non-intensive systems (small local gardens that depend on wild bees) because of dependence on honeybees. These types of farms have a high demand for honeybee pollination services, which in the U.S. alone costs $1.25 billion annually. This cost is offset, however, as honeybees as pollinators generate 22.8 to 57 billion Euros globally.|$|E
5|$|During 1928–1973, the Soviet Union {{was growing}} {{economically}} {{at a pace}} that would eventually catch up with the United States and Western Europe. This was true despite the advantage the United States had — the USSR was hampered by the effects of World War II, which had left most of Western USSR in ruins. In 1973, the process of catching up {{with the rest of the}} West came to an abrupt end, and 1973 was seen by some scholars as the start of the Era of Stagnation. The beginning of the stagnation coincided with a financial crisis in Western Europe and the U.S. By the early 1970s, the Soviet Union had the world's second largest industrial capacity, and produced more steel, oil, pig-iron, cement and tractors than any other country. Before 1973, the Soviet economy was expanding at faster rate than that of the <b>American</b> <b>economy</b> (albeit by a very small margin). The USSR also kept a steady pace with the economies of Western Europe. Between 1964 and 1973, the Soviet economy stood at roughly half the output per head of Western Europe and a little more than one third that of the U.S.|$|E
