5|$|Within the congregation, {{there are}} many {{organizations}} that specialize in various activities, all of which strive to better the church or community or both. These groups allow parishioners to work {{with each other in}} order to reach common goals and also allows them to become more involved in Mt. St. Peter Church. This way, the congregation can remain a close knit family, not just a church where parishioners spend an hour praying on Sunday mornings. The organizations listed <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> are currently active, there were in the past, many others, like the Committee of a hundred (mentioned in the history section), which are no longer in existence.|$|E

25|$|The eruptions {{considered}} to {{be large enough to}} affect the Earth's climate on a scale of more than 1 year <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> inject over 100,000 tons of SO2 into the stratosphere. This is due to the optical properties of SO2 and sulfate aerosols, which strongly absorb or scatter solar radiation, creating a global layer of sulfuric acid haze. On average, such eruptions occur several times per century, and cause cooling (by partially blocking the transmission of solar radiation to the Earth's surface) for a period of a few years.|$|E

This last problem was what the senator for Tucumán Benjamín Paz prepared to rectify, by means of a law project presented in 1878 that noticed 29 new errors. As this project passed through the commissions of the Chambers of Deputies and Senators, the number grew up as far as 285. This 285 errors <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> the Law No. 1196 corrects, sanctioned August 29, 1882, commonly known as the Law of Errata, though it was the second of its kind to be sanctioned.|$|E
25|$|Males that {{compete for}} more mating {{opportunities}} <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> have shown less cooperation in breeding. However, {{there are other}} males {{that in order to}} gain access to females and mating opportunities practice parental care. Such parental care is mostly seen in polyandrous mating systems; but they must go through the cost of sharing paternity and parental care. This has been observed in avians like acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus), and fishes as the cichlid fish (Julidochromis transcriptus). Observations that show male relatedness suggest the importance for male social relationships in taking care of offspring. These social relationships in males are seen in primates, Geoffroy's tamarins, Saguinus geoffroyi. High proportions of related males at the half sibling or higher were found.|$|E

500|$|A {{principal}} submatrix is {{a square}} submatrix obtained by removing certain rows and columns. [...] The definition varies from author to author. According to some authors, a principal submatrix is a submatrix {{in which the}} set of row indices that remain {{is the same as}} the set of column indices that remain. Other authors define a principal submatrix to be one in which the first k rows and columns, for some number k, <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> remain; this type of submatrix has also been called a leading principal submatrix.|$|E
500|$|In some places, {{this species}} feeds {{only on a}} few prey types and little else (e.g. innkeeper worms and cancrid crabs in Tomales Bay, jack {{silverside}} (Atherinopsis californiensis) eggs and the crabs Romaleon antennarium and Metacarcinus magister in Humboldt Bay). The predominant prey taken depends on location, time of year, and age. For example, in the Elkhorn Slough at Monterey Bay, cancrid crabs and innkeeper worms are mostly eaten in winter and spring, fish eggs from winter to early summer, bony fish in summer, and grapsid crabs and clams in fall. Young sharks feed mostly on crabs and transition to clam siphons, fish eggs, and innkeeper worms once they reach [...] long. The largest sharks <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> consume the most fish.|$|E

500|$|Steve Hochman of Los Angeles Times {{credited}} the album's catchy melodies {{for being}} smartly and effectively handled, commenting that [...] "it almost {{makes you wonder}} {{what would have happened}} if Television and Peter Frampton had worked together". Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly wrote that, although the band [...] "can still knock out a noisy punk stomper when the mood strikes" [...] like on the track [...] "Sleepin Around", the cleaner and quieter melodies <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> [...] "really rip up your emotions". Slants Jimmy Newlin stated similar pros, noting that [...] "quiet is the new loud", and felt that the band's shift towards romantic poignancy was [...] "a welcome growth as the band advances well into its second decade of existence".|$|E

Blundell, in Library Journal, finds Angelou's poetry {{lacking in}} {{comparison}} to her prose, and states, [...] "The reader is jarred by stilted, 'poetic' language and stilted, sing-song, school-girlish rhyme". [...] She finds the best poems in Shaker <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> are structured like blues music. [...] Mary S. Cosgrove, in Horn Book Magazine, calls the poems in Shaker [...] "a lyrical outpouring of seasoned feelings from the heart and mind", and calls Angelou [...] "musical, rhythmical, and enchanting". [...] J.T. Keefe, in World Literature Today, says about Shaker": [...] "Deceptively light and graceful, Maya Angelou's poems are lyrical, emotional, melancholy". [...] Keefe compares Angelou's poems to music, especially the music of French singer Édith Piaf, and also states, [...] "These poems are full of shining hurt as, like curving scimitars, they skillfully pierce the hearts of their readers".|$|E
500|$|Random Access Memories {{has been}} noted by music critics as a disco album. Regarding {{the style of the}} album, they sought a [...] "west coast vibe", {{referencing}} such acts as Fleetwood Mac, the Doobie Brothers and the Eagles. Daft Punk also acknowledged that the record pays homage to Michael Jackson, the Cars and Steely Dan. The recording of live synthesizer parts was done in a progressive rock fashion, with the pop sensibilities of Wizzard and the Move. Daft Punk specifically looked to the albums Rumours by Fleetwood Mac and The Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd as models. Bangalter felt that [...] "the most important records in music, whether it's Led Zeppelin [...] or The White Album or Sgt.

500|$|As the band's primary lyricist, McIlrath is {{wary of the}} {{political}} label. [...] "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us sort of an anomaly and I think that’s where we get the tag 'protest music' or 'political punk rock'". He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss social topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics. In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: [...] "I {{think that a lot}} of the problems we deal with today in the world <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> have been plaguing society for centuries and probably will be here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they're listening to [...] 10 years from now." [...] Principe noted the band does not try to preach their beliefs, but instead encourage listeners to become involved, and learn about pertinent issues affecting society.|$|E

The influence has been noted by critics, who have termed Soule [...] "the John Williams of video game music". Among video game music influences, he has cited Square for providing him [...] "with the education for what quality means to this business" [...] and Nobuo Uematsu in particular. His favorite style of music to listen to is British pop and rock music, while his favorite video games <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> he has written scores to, especially the ones made by Chris Taylor, though one of his all-time favorites is The Legend of Zelda.
