50|$|On {{the other}} hand, if a stock and its {{benchmark}} are poorly correlated, the respective returns will move independently. This {{could result in}} a relative performance index that is more volatile than the target. In such a case the <b>Alpha</b> <b>Index</b> option would be more expensive than a plain option on the target.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alpha</b> <b>Indexes</b> {{currently}} {{listed at}} NASDAQ are as given below.|$|R
5000|$|The Nasdaq OMX <b>Alpha</b> <b>Indexes</b> were {{developed}} by Jacob S. Sagi and Robert E. Whaley, both professors at the Owen Graduate School of Management, Vanderbilt University. They published a research paper “Trading Relative Performance with Alpha Indexes” [...] in the November/ December 2011 issue of Financial Analysts Journal detailing the concept behind <b>Alpha</b> <b>Indexes.</b>|$|R
50|$|For NASDAQ OMX <b>Alpha</b> <b>Indexes</b> {{that are}} {{currently}} trading, b=1, and the relative performance index {{can be viewed as}} an outperformance index. Moreover, in practice the updating takes place continuously rather than once a day.|$|R
50|$|<b>Alpha</b> <b>Index</b> options began {{trading on}} the NASDAQ OMX PHLX on April 18, 2011 with the launch of {{contracts}} on AVSPY. As of September 26, 2011 options on seven indexes trade. If an investor is long an AVSPY call option, he/ she would benefit if returns on APPL are better than returns on SPY. If the investor is long a put option on AVSPY, he/ she would gain if AAPL underperforms SPY.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability to}} {{estimate}} implied correlation also allows investors to trade correlation. As discussed earlier a higher (lower) correlation implies low (high) volatility of <b>alpha</b> <b>index</b> and hence low (high) option prices. Consequently, if an investor believes the correlation will increase (decrease), he/ she can sell (buy) index call options to gain profits. Thus estimating market expectations of correlation of stocks can help investors to hedge their {{risk in the}} long term.|$|E
50|$|This formula can in turn be used {{to compute}} the implied {{correlation}} of the target with the benchmark as follows. If the target and benchmark volatilities can be accurately estimated using volatilities implied by the prices of options on the securities, then the option prices on the <b>alpha</b> <b>index</b> would imply {{the correlation between the}} target and the benchmark. This gives researchers a tool to calculate forward looking implied estimate of the correlation between target and market and the beta of the target security.|$|E
5000|$|Nasdaq OMX <b>Alpha</b> <b>Indexes</b> {{measure the}} {{relative}} performance of an underlying stock or exchange-traded fund (ETF) against another benchmark [...] ETF using a proprietary calculation. The first {{component in the}} index is the “Target Component”, such as Apple (AAPL), and the second component is identified as a “Benchmark Component”, such as the S&P 500 ETF (SPY).|$|R
30|$|The {{data were}} {{described}} with 23 response {{variables related to}} species diversity, phylogenetic diversity, vegetation structure, dispersal syndrome, and distribution of abundant species. For species diversity, two measures of species richness were used, namely {{the number of species}} and the Fisher’s <b>alpha</b> diversity <b>index,</b> as well as Shannon’s diversity index and the corresponding Pielou’s evenness index (Magurran [1988]), calculated in Past 2.10. The Fisher’s <b>alpha</b> diversity <b>index</b> was used because species richness per se usually increases with increasing number of individuals, whereas the Fisher’s <b>alpha</b> diversity <b>index</b> is a robust species richness estimate that is not influenced by biases in the number of individuals (Maurer and McGill [2011]). To use Fisher’s <b>alpha</b> diversity <b>index,</b> the species abundance distribution should not be different from the log-series (Maurer and McGill [2011]), which was the case for our data (p[*]=[*] 1, as calculated using the Past 2.10 software).|$|R
50|$|Investors might view <b>Alpha</b> <b>Indexes</b> as {{a measure}} of {{numerical}} difference between the returns of the target and the benchmark component. It {{is important to note that}} the percentage increase in the index over a period, say a day, is only approximately equal to the difference between the returns of the target and its benchmark. The extent to which this approximation fails is called “slippage”.|$|R
5000|$|Nasdaq OMX {{launched}} the live calculation {{and dissemination of}} Alpha Indexes on October 11, 2010. The Alpha Indexes were set at 100.00 as of January 1, 2010. Thus each disseminated index depicts a target component’s return performance versus its benchmark since January 1, 2010. For example, the <b>Alpha</b> <b>Index</b> for AAPL with SPY as the benchmark, which trades under the symbol AVSPY, had a level of 199.91 on 11/09/12. This means that over the period between 1/1/2010 until 11/09/2012 an investment in AAPL outperformed an investment in SPY by +99.91% ...|$|E

40|$|The world’s {{biodiversity}} {{is declining}} {{with much of}} the decrease attributed to human activity. The paleotropical rainforests of Borneo contribute 10 % of the world biodiversity but are at risk of destruction due to logging and other human interests. Soundscape ecology, defi ned as the study of the composition of sounds in an environment, is a new fi eld that offers solutions for assessing biodiversity and disturbance. Spatial dynamics are an important component of an ecosystem, yet the link between spatial dynamics and soundscapes has not yet been studied. It should be possible to assess disturbance of an ecosystem by analyzing the spatial structure of the soundscape. Particularly, soundscapes in undisturbed ecosystems should exhibit more spatial autocorrelation than soundscapes in disturbed ecosystems. We took automated bihourly 10 -minute recordings at a disturbed (n = 4, 905) and an undisturbed (n = 8, 450) transect in Brunei, Borneo, for a month-long period. Sites had identical spatial configurations, with 13 recorders at each site. <b>Alpha</b> acoustic <b>indices</b> were computed from recorded sound files, and beta acoustic indices were calculated pairwise for each 13 recorder group at each unique recording time. Moran’s I statistics were calculated to compare the resultant <b>alpha</b> <b>indices</b> from the two transects. We compared beta indices by Mantel Tests. Spatial statistics on <b>alpha</b> and beta <b>indices</b> reveal more spatial autocorrelation and correlation at the undisturbed site. Of all <b>alpha</b> <b>indices,</b> Normalized Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI) detected spatial autocorrelation to the highest extent. Beta acoustic indices detected differences between the two sites more precisely, due to their comparative nature...|$|R
30|$|Exploratory factor {{analysis}} indicated adequate psychometric {{results for the}} instrument. The extracted factors, (1) focus on emotion, (2) focus on social support, (3) focus on religious coping, and (4) focus on the problem, maintained 26 original items of the scale, {{taking into account the}} criterion of validity in their factor loading. The factors of the scale achieved Cronbach’s <b>alpha</b> <b>indices</b> between reasonable and satisfactory, which means the instrument can be applied in coping studies with university students.|$|R
50|$|<b>Alpha</b> <b>indexes</b> were {{designed}} {{to reduce the amount}} of market risk in a stock. This will generally be true if the market beta of the target is greater than one half (which is true of the “typical stock”). If AAPL and SPY have a high degree of correlation, the relative performance index will not be as volatile as the underlying stock. Consequently, volatility for AVSPY would be lower than that for AAPL. This also implies that AVSPY options are cheaper than AAPL options.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the performance of}} the Sri Kehati Index (SKI) against the Jakarta Composite Index (JCI) as the market index, using respective daily index prices from the 1 st of January 2009 to the 31 st of December 2014. This study uses the risk-adjusted return of Sharpe’s Index, the Adjusted Sharpe’s Index (ASI), Treynor’s Index, Jensen’s <b>Alpha</b> <b>Index,</b> the Adjusted Jensen’s <b>Alpha</b> <b>Index</b> (AJI) and Sortino’s Ratio to examine {{the performance of the}} SKI and the JCI. Except for Sharpe’s Index and the Adjusted Sharpe’s Index, the risk-adjusted return performance of the SKI (Treynor, Jensen’s Alpha, Adjusted Jensen’s Alpha and Sortino) outperforms the JCI as the conventional benchmark. However, Jensen’s Alpha is the only performance measure that is significant and therefore supports that the SKI outperforms the JCI during the overall period from 2009 to 2014. As there is a contradiction between the adjusted returns of Sharpe’s Index/Adjusted Sharpe’s Index and Jensen’s <b>Alpha</b> <b>Index,</b> the hypothesis that the SKI presents a higher risk adjusted performance than the JCI does, it cannot be accepted. Even though the performance of SKI in this study is slightly lower over the whole period of the study, it is still generating competitive returns...|$|E
40|$|According to the {{classical}} measurement theory [2], {{the reliability of the}} relationship between a latent variable describing a true measure and its corresponding manifest proxies can be assessed through the Cronbach’s <b>Alpha</b> <b>index.</b> The Cronbach’s <b>Alpha</b> <b>index</b> can be used for parallel measures and represents a lower bound for the reliability value in presence of congeneric measures, for which the assessment can properly be made only ex post, once the loading coefficients have been estimated [3], e. g. by means of a structural equation model with latent variables (SEM-LV). Let us assume the existence of an a-priori segmentation, based upon a categorical variable Z. We want to test the reliability of the construct over all the groups. This corresponds to the null joint hypothesis that the loadings are equal within each group as well as they do not vary among groups. Otherwise different measurement models need to be defined over groups. A test for measuring group differences in reliability is presented in [5], basing on differences of loading estimates in a SEM-LV framework. We consider a formulation of the Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient according to the decomposition of pairwise covariances in a clustered framework...|$|E
40|$|The study {{attempted}} {{to know the}} reletionship between knowledge, skill and attitude (KSA) of Library and Media Teacher with School Source Center management aspects in seven primary schools in Zon Akademik A, Ulu Tiram, Johor. The study also explore the level of knowledge, skill and attitude of Library and Media Teacher, the most effective school source center management aspects {{and the relationship between}} knowledge, skill and attitude of Library and Media Teacher with School Source Center management aspects. A total of 170 teachers in seven primary schools were selected for this study. The survey instruments were constructed from “The Triangle of Success” by Van Hooser (1998) for knowledge, skill and attitude items. Other survey instruments used were contructed from POLC management model. All datas were analized by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). From the pilot test result, the <b>alpha</b> <b>index</b> for knowledge, skill and attitude aspects was 0. 9358 whereelse the <b>alpha</b> <b>index</b> for management aspects was 0. 9316. Knowledge was the highest level among the three element of Knowledge, Skill and Attitude. The most effective aspect in management was controlling. Overall, the study showed there was a significant relationship between knowledge, skill and attitude aspects of Library and Media Teacher with School Source Center management aspects. Relevant recommendations based on findings from this study were put forward...|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} feature of <b>Alpha</b> <b>Indexes</b> is the incorporation of dividends in its calculation. This gives a more accurate and factual relative performance of the target security {{with respect to the}} benchmark. It also puts all the securities on an equal footing, as a non dividend security has an unfair advantage in terms of price performance over a dividend paying security. This feature is not available for many other indices (e.g., the S&P 500 index does not factor in the reinvestment of dividends and thus only includes price appreciation or, in other words, capital gains).|$|R

30|$|First of all, EFA was {{conducted}} to determine what items {{should be included in}} the models and what items to discard when they did not load on the investigated dimension. The EFA was also performed to assess the number and the validity of the underlying multidimensional constructs. Finally, the Cronbach’s <b>alpha</b> <b>index</b> was used to assess the reliability of the emerging measurement scale. As a second step of the analysis, we framed and estimated a SEM per each set of hypotheses formulated. Specifying the model followed an iterative process based on theoretical and empirical analyses until the structural model fit was positively tested.|$|E
30|$|Decision-makers attach varying {{importance}} to the project evaluation criteria discussed above. To examine the consistency of project evaluation as calculated by different criteria, the following method was used: all of the analyzed projects were ranked by each of the relevant four criteria. Then the first three sequences of ranks (the performance criteria – ROI, PP, IRR) were examined for internal consistency using Cronbach's <b>alpha</b> <b>index.</b> This statistical index (Cronbach 1951) is widely used, in particular to examine project performance consistency (Khang and Moe 2008). In addition, for each sequence of rank pairs, {{the significance of the}} correlation coefficient was estimated.|$|E

We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of non-invasive cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) models. Methods Patients with COPD and suspected PH, who underwent CMR and right heart catheter (RHC) were identified. Three candidate models were assessed: 1, CMR-RV model, based on right ventricular (RV) mass and interventricular septal angle; 2, CMR PA/RV includes RV mass, septal angle and pulmonary artery (PA) measurements; 3, the <b>Alpha</b> <b>index,</b> based on RV ejection fraction and PA size.

40|$|International audienceA {{detailed}} analysis of electromagnetic fluctuations recorded during several magnetopause and boundary layer crossings by the ESA GEOS- 2 geostationary spacecraft is presented. A high level of electromagnetic fluctuations in the ULF (0 - 10 Hz) range is observed for each such crossing. The obtained frequency spectra are shown to fit with a power law f exp -alpha. The distribution of these <b>alpha</b> <b>indexes</b> {{is found to be}} narrow, with a peak value of about 2. 5 which does not depend on the direction with respect to the magnetic field.

40|$|This study {{sought to}} explore whether the {{so-called}} 'paradoxical' task-related increases in the alpha bandwidth of the human electroencephalogram result from increases in evoked (phase locked), as opposed to induced (non-phase locked), activity. The electroencephalograms of 18 participants were recorded while they engaged in both auditory sensory-intake tasks (listening to randomly generated 'tunes') and internally directed attention tasks (imagining the same randomly generated tunes) matched for auditory input. Measures of evoked (phase locked) and induced (non-phase locked) activity were compared between tasks. Increases in induced alpha power were found during internal attention. No experimental effects were observed for evoked activity. These results are not entirely consistent with proposals that 'paradoxical' <b>alpha</b> <b>indexes</b> the evoked inhibition of task irrelevant processing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{performance}} of road network {{depends on its}} topological characteristics which help to define its connectiv-ity. This paper analyses the topological characteristic of Jos city road network and its bearing on traffic flow situations. Simple graph theoretic measures offered the framework on which the problem was approached. The study requires the abstraction {{and analysis of the}} topological structure by selection of certain variables relating to the road connectivity. These include the Beta, Gamma and <b>Alpha</b> <b>index,</b> the PI, Cyclomatic number, and the spread and density of the network. Information on these variables was obtained through the use of vector data model to abstract the road network graph from the Quick-bird satellite imagery used for the study. Results of the findings reveal that, the road network of Jos City Centre as a whole have achieved an average level of connectivity, showing Beta index values of 1. 4049, Gamma index value of 47. 06 %, <b>Alpha</b> <b>index</b> Value of 20. 63 %; and a pi and cyclomatic number of 24. 74 and 165 respectively, the spread of the network is moderate exhibiting a value of 23, even though some areas have more concentration of roads than the others; and has a road density of 52 links per km 2. Based on these findings, the need for construction of new roads is imperative so as to improve the efficiency of connectivity and accessibility within the city.

In theta, high susceptibles had greater activity posthypnosis, otherwise there were no group differences. These findings common to low and high susceptibles suggest that theta is an index of relaxation that continues after hypnosis in highs. In alpha in high susceptibles, posterior power increased from the prehypnosis to hypnosis conditions and decreased posthypnosis. Exactly the converse effects were seen in lows. Furthermore, highs had greater alpha power than lows during both prehypnosis and hypnosis conditions, demonstrating an association of alpha with hypnotic susceptibility.
