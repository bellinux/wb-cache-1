5|$|Tang {{received}} a Singapore International Foundation art grant {{to participate in}} the International Art Symposium in Meiho, Japan, in October 1994. In March the following year, he {{received a}} trophy and S$20,000 from the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry Foundation. For his originality and influence in performance art in Southeast Asia, among other contributions, Tang won the Arts and Culture Prize in 1999 at the 10th Fukuoka <b>Asian</b> <b>Culture</b> Prizes which were established by Fukuoka and Yokatopia Foundation to honour outstanding work of individuals or organizations to preserve and create the unique and diverse culture of Asia.|$|E
5|$|In January 1994, the National Arts Council (NAC) stopped funding unscripted {{performance}} art following a controversial performance by Josef Ng that {{was regarded as}} obscene by {{many members of the}} public. From that time, Tang and other {{performance art}}ists mostly practised their art abroad, although some performances were presented in Singapore as dance or theatre. For his originality and influence in performance art in Southeast Asia, among other things, Tang won the Arts and Culture Prize in 1999 at the 10th Fukuoka <b>Asian</b> <b>Culture</b> Prizes. The NAC eventually reversed its no-funding rule on performance art in September 2003. Tang was one of four artists who represented Singapore at the 2007 Venice Biennale. Tang's work is part of the collection of the Singapore Art Museum, Queensland Art Gallery and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.|$|E
5|$|In 1916 the French Sinologist and {{historian}} Paul Pelliot used Tang Chinese manuscripts excavated from Dunhuang, Gansu to identify an ancient Sogdian colony south of Lop Nur in Xinjiang (Northwest China), which he argued was {{the base for}} the spread of Buddhism and Nestorian Christianity in China. In 1926 Japanese scholar Kuwabara compiled evidence for Sogdians in Chinese historical sources and by 1933 Chinese historian Xiang Da published his Tang Chang'an and Central <b>Asian</b> <b>Culture</b> detailing the Sogdian influence on Chinese social religious life in the Tang-era Chinese capital city. The Canadian Sinologist Edwin G. Pulleyblank published an article in 1952 demonstrating {{the presence of a}} Sogdian colony founded in Six Hu Prefectures of the Ordos Loop during the Chinese Tang period, composed of Sogdians and Turkic peoples who migrated from the Mongolian steppe. The Japanese historian Ikeda On wrote an article in 1965 outlining the history of the Sogdians inhabiting Dunhuang {{from the beginning of the}} 7th century, analyzing lists of their Sinicized names and the role of Zoroastrianism and Buddhism in their religious life. Yoshida Yutaka and Kageyama Etsuko, Japanese ethnographers and linguists of the Sogdian language, were able to reconstruct Sogdian names from forty-five different Chinese transliterations, noting that these were common in Turfan whereas Sogdians living closer to the center of Chinese civilization for generations adopted traditional Chinese names.|$|E

25|$|Christians {{regarded}} the emperor {{as a mere}} man who was as much under God's authority as were his subjects, and Christian values favored the social emancipation of women and children. The church permitted the remarriage of widows (as taught by the apostle Paul, not traditionally allowed in East Asian societies), prohibited concubinage and polygamy, and forbade cruelty to or desertion of wives. Christian parents were taught to regard their children as gifts from God, and were required to educate them. Arranged child marriages and the neglect of daughters (who were often regarded as less desirable than sons in <b>Asian</b> <b>culture)</b> were prohibited.|$|E
25|$|Bhangra dance {{began as}} a folk dance {{conducted}} by Punjabi farmers to celebrate {{the coming of the}} harvest season. The specific moves of Bhangra reflect the manner in which villagers farmed their land. This hybrid dance became Bhangra. The folk dance has been popularised in the western world by Punjabis in England, Canada and the USA where competitions are held. It is seen in the West as an expression of South <b>Asian</b> <b>culture</b> as a whole. Today, Bhangra dance survives in different forms and styles all over the globe – including pop music, film soundtracks, collegiate competitions and cultural shows.|$|E

25|$|One major {{convention}} held in {{the convention}} center was Otakon, a convention that focuses on anime and other facets of East <b>Asian</b> <b>culture.</b> The convention had resided in the Baltimore Convention Center between 1999 and 2016. In 2013, the convention attracted 34,211 people. However, organizers of that convention announced {{at the close of}} the 2013 event plans to move to the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, DC for at least five years starting in 2017. Convention officials cited space concerns, along with the uncertainty of construction plans for the convention center and a new arena. According to WBAL-TV, Baltimore's local NBC news affiliate, due to the pending departure of Otakon in 2017 to Washington D.C., concerns were mounting regarding Baltimore's economic future when it came to tourism. In 2016, Otakon's final year in Baltimore, 29,113 people attended, a decline from its peak attendance of 34,211 in 2013.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Croydon Council {{drew up a}} Public Art Strategy, with {{a vision}} {{intended}} to be accessible and to enhance people's enjoyment of their surroundings. The public art strategy delivered a new event called Croydon's Summer Festival hosted in Lloyd Park. The festival consists of two days of events. The first is called Croydon's World Party which is a free one-day event with three stages featuring world, jazz and dance music from the UK and internationally. The final days event is the Croydon Mela, a day of music {{with a mix of}} traditional <b>Asian</b> <b>culture</b> and east-meets-western club beats across four stages as well as dozens of food stalls and a funfair. It has attracted crowds of over 50,000 people. The strategy also created a creative industries hub in Old Town, ensured that public art is included in developments such as College Green and Ruskin Square and investigated the possibility of gallery space in the Cultural Quarter.|$|E

40|$|In an East and West {{debate on}} human rights, {{scholars}} from different cultures disagree on whether all {{civil and political}} rights are human rights. While they generally agree that basic civil rights such as rights against torture and slavery (i. e., physical security rights) are human rights, some of them argue that traditional political rights in the West such as freedom of speech and political participation (i. e., liberal rights) are not human rights. Some scholars, such as Daniel A. Bell, argue that liberal rights are not human rights because liberal rights conflict with some East <b>Asian</b> <b>cultures.</b> In this dissertation, I argue that both physical security rights and liberal rights are human rights, and explain the relationship between these rights and East <b>Asian</b> <b>cultures.</b> First, I argue that if liberal rights are not human rights because they conflict with some East <b>Asian</b> <b>cultures,</b> then physical security rights are also not human rights because physical security rights also conflict with some East <b>Asian</b> <b>cultures.</b> Next, I discuss the idea from Daniel Bell and Michael Walzer that physical security rights are human rights because they are minimal values. Based on their idea, I explain what minimal values are, and why it is possible to develop some maximal theories of physical security rights in East <b>Asian</b> <b>cultures.</b> I argue that since physical security rights are minimal values, they are still human rights even they conflict with some East <b>Asian</b> <b>cultures.</b> I then argue that liberal rights, similar to physical security rights, are also minimal values, and it is possible to develop some maximal theories of them in East <b>Asian</b> <b>cultures.</b> Therefore, similar to physical security rights, liberal rights are also human rights even they also conflict with some East <b>Asian</b> <b>cultures.</b> I also discuss other human rights debates, especially the debates between Daniel Bell and other philosophers. Charles Taylor argues for an overlapping consensus approach on human rights; Jack Donnelly argues for a Western liberalist approach on human rights. I explain the relationship between these approaches and my arguments, and how my arguments can help them to reply to the challenges from Daniel Bell...|$|R
