5|$|English ornithologist John Latham {{described}} the boobook owl as Strix boobook in 1801, taking its species epithet {{from a local}} Aboriginal word for the bird. John Gould described <b>Athene</b> marmorata in 1846 from a specimen in South Australia; this is now regarded as a synonym. German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup classified the two taxa into subgenus Spiloglaux of a new genus Ieraglaux in 1852, renaming S. boobook to Ieraglaux (Spiloglaux) bubuk. In his 1865 Handbook to the Birds of Australia, Gould recognised three species, all of which he placed in the genus Spiloglaux: S. marmoratus from South Australia, S. boobook, which is widespread across the continent and Tasmania, and S. maculatus from southeastern Australia and Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of starling predators are avian. The typical response of starling groups {{is to take}} flight, with a common sight being undulating flocks of starling flying high in quick and agile patterns. Their abilities in flight are seldom matched by birds of prey. Adult common starlings are hunted by hawks such as the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), and falcons including the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo) and common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus). Slower raptors like black and red kites (Milvus migrans & milvus), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and Australasian harrier (Circus approximans) tend to take the more easily caught fledglings or juveniles. While perched in groups by night, they can be vulnerable to owls, including the little owl (<b>Athene</b> noctua), long-eared owl (Asio otus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), barn owl (Tyto alba), tawny owl (Strix aluco) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo).|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} years, through loans and donations, <b>Athene</b> Lodge became a Hall Stone Lodge {{and then a}} Patron Lodge of the Royal Masonic Hospital in 1939. After World War II, information was received that the contract {{for the purchase of}} the Sutton Masonic Hall had been signed and exchanged, and the Lodge contributed 300 guineas to become a shareholder. At a meeting on 17 December 1949, it was reported that a petition had been signed for a Warrant of Constitution for a Royal Arch Chapter to be attached to the Lodge. At {{the following}} meeting in February 1950, it was reported that the petition had been approved by the Supreme Grand Chapter and the new <b>Athene</b> Chapter was consecrated on 9 May 1950.|$|E

Hera and Athena encouraged Diomedes to attack Ares (V.780–834). Diomedes thrust with his spear at Ares, with Athena driving it home, and Ares's cries made Achaeans and Trojans alike tremble (V.855–864). Ares fled to Mt. Olympus, forcing the Trojans to fall back.|$|E
25|$|The {{burrowing}} owl (<b>Athene</b> cunicularia hypugaea) is an endangered species. They inhabit holes created by other {{animals such as}} Richardson's ground squirrel (gopher), prairie dog, fox, coyote, and badger. Their decline is due to habitat loss due to agricultural, residential and highway lands, and pesticide spraying. Another endangered species, the swift fox (Vulpes velox), has been bred in captivity and re-introduced into protected habitat areas. Lake sturgeon is a Species at Risk in the prairie provinces.|$|E

25|$|Demetrius II issued only {{silver and}} mostly tetradrachms, another trait {{which he has}} {{in common with the}} last Bactrian kings. The obverse shows a diademed portrait, with a {{standing}} Pallas <b>Athene</b> holding a spear on the reverse. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he has no epithet. Demetrius II is depicted as a young man, though his features differ considerably among the different issues. Several coins are struck off-center and crudely; this suggests that Demetrius II used a number of temporary mints.|$|E
25|$|The gods fashion {{their home}} on Olympus, and Zeus seduces Hera by {{transforming}} {{himself into a}} cuckoo. Their child is hideous and misshapen, and Hera throws the child out into the sky. At the revelation of his parentage, Hephaestus breaks the brooch, and half is washed to sea. His desire for vengeance are tempered by the realization of Zeus' immense power. The narrative then shifts from Hephaestus and the goddesses to recount concurrent events amongst the Olympians, including the arrival at Olympus of Apollo, Artemis, <b>Athene</b> and Hermes.|$|E

25|$|Énée then rushes {{on to tell}} of the devouring of {{the priest}} Laocoön by a sea serpent, after he had warned the Trojans to burn the horse. Énée {{interpret}}s this {{as a sign of}} the goddess Athene's anger at the sacrilege. Against Cassandre's futile protests, Priam orders the horse to be brought within the city of Troy and placed next to the temple of Pallas <b>Athene.</b> There is a sound of what seems to be the clashing of arms from within the horse, but the Trojans, in their delusion, interpret it as a happy omen. Cassandre has watched the procession in despair, and as the act ends, resigns herself to death beneath the walls of Troy.|$|E
25|$|The {{burrowing}} owl (<b>Athene</b> cunicularia) is a small, long-legged owl found throughout open landscapes of North and South America. Burrowing owls {{can be found}} in grasslands, rangelands, agricultural areas, deserts, or any other open dry area with low vegetation. They nest and roost in burrows, such as those excavated by prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.). Unlike most owls, {{burrowing owl}}s are often active during the day, although they tend to avoid the midday heat. Like many other kinds of owls, though, burrowing owls do most of their hunting from dusk until dawn, when they can use their night vision and hearing to their advantage. Living in open grasslands as opposed to forests, the burrowing owl has developed longer legs that enable it to sprint, as well as fly, when hunting.|$|E
25|$|The food of this {{carnivore}} consists {{mainly of}} mid-sized mammals; the introduced European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) {{seems to have}} become a key prey item. The black-chested buzzard-eagle is helpful to farmers by keeping down the numbers of the rabbits, which can be serious agricultural pests. Among the native fauna degus (Octodon) and hog-nosed skunks (Conepatus) are important prey, but mammals as formidable as a gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) – two to over three times as heavy as the birds and certainly not defenceless – are occasionally hunted and killed by this hawk. Its diet is rounded off with an occasional bird – including carnivorous species like the burrowing owl (<b>Athene</b> cunicularia) and sizeable prey such as Penelope guans or the Chilean tinamou (Nothoprocta perdicaria) –, large squamates, and if need be also arthropods and carrion. While not aggressive under normal circumstances, the black-chested eagle-buzzard will fiercely attack humans if it considers itself or its offspring threatened. It is {{near the top of}} the avian food chain in its range, in part since it is the only Andean eagle found outside forest habitats. It may compete for carrion with the much larger Andean condor.|$|E
