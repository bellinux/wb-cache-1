5|$|Satti (Sunil), Addala household's dutiful servant {{wakes up}} Siddhu in the morning. In the background, Siddhu's mother, Lakshmi (Jayasudha), is seen singing a devotional Telugu song while cooking. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> table, Aravind, Managing Director of their {{construction}} company, asks if Siddhu will join their office.

He speaks with her only to realize that she is a daddy's girl (Tanikella Bharani being the father) and does not take a liking to her. However, with Aravind's final say, they eventually get engaged.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} opens with several shots of a dining table; it {{includes}} uneaten sweets, foods, and small pink bird ornaments. The first verse features close-ups {{of the girls}} singing and dancing to the song, {{in front of a}} beige backdrop. The chorus section has three scenes of each member; Kashiyuka is seen laying down with an electronics cable in her hand; Nocchi is seen <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> table; and A-Chan is seen under a table with a cable telephone. During the instrumental break, close-up shots (yet very blurry) features a fish bowl that have small fishing swimming around. The second verse repeats the first verses video shoots.|$|E

5|$|The second chorus has {{the girls}} {{dancing on the}} table, {{knocking}} several pieces of food and tuppleware onto the ground. A-Chan is seen lying down on a pillow, whilst Kashiyuka balances a book and an apple on her head. Both of these scenes have them throwing several pieces of food onto the table. Nocchi is seen <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> table, holding a fork and listen to music through her headphones. She witnesses a small door underneath a stool, opens it, and sees a small green room. In the room, a blurred image of a cup starts to become clear, and holds small candy. As the girls eat the pieces of candy, their cream-coloured dresses turn into the outfits from the cover sleeve from the single. The girls start dancing in the fish bowl, surrounded by glittery lights. The final scene has the girls looking through the small door again, only to witness {{the dining room table}} empty; the small cup with candy appears in beige colouring rather than full-on vibrancy.|$|E
25|$|Although major {{decisions}} {{about the future of}} the kibbutz were made by consensus or by voting, day-to-day decisions about where people would work were made by elected leaders. Typically, kibbutzniks would learn their assignments by consulting the duty sheet <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> hall.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{cultivated}} in Iran and the Mediterranean region, cumin is {{mentioned in the}} Bible in both the Old Testament (Isaiah 28:27) and the New Testament (Matthew 23:23). The ancient Greeks kept cumin <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> table in its own container (much as pepper is frequently kept today), and this practice continues in Morocco. Cumin was also used heavily in ancient Roman cuisine. In India, {{it has been used}} for millennia as a traditional ingredient in innumerable recipes, and forms the basis of many other spice blends.|$|E
25|$|A deep fluted {{bowl with}} two small swing handles (which were {{detached}} {{at the time}} of discovery, because solder tends to loosen during burial) is of a type found in several late Roman silver hoards, such as those in the Esquiline Treasure from Rome, and from Traprain Law in Scotland. The type is thought to have developed from earlier shell-shaped bowls, and to have been used to contain water <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> table, intended for rinsing diners' hands. The chased geometric design in the centre of the Mildenhall fluted bowl depicts a six-pointed star, a device that had no specific symbolic meaning in the Roman period, but was simply one of many popular geometric figures.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{stayed at}} the home of McCartney and his wife Linda during the {{recording}} sessions, and became friends with both. While <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> table one evening, Paul McCartney brought out a booklet that displayed all the songs to which he owned the publishing rights. [...] "This is the way to make big money", the musician informed Jackson. [...] "Every time someone records one of these songs, I get paid. Every time someone plays these songs on the radio, or in live performances, I get paid." [...] McCartney's words influenced Jackson's later purchase of ATV Music Publishing in 1985.|$|E
500|$|Once {{principal}} photography was finished, Forman {{found himself}} with miles of raw material, {{so he and}} his editor, Miroslav Hájek, spent many long hours organizing the footage {{into a series of}} situations, like the [...] "big dance" [...] situation and the [...] "meeting the parents" [...] situation. In turn, each of these situations are constructed out of sequences of gags in which the characters improvise, in the words of commentator Constantin Parvulescu, [...] "like various instruments of a band": [...] "Many of these situations can be broken down into gags. There are several such gags reminiscent of early comedy in Loves of a Blonde: the soldiers-getting-off-the-train gag; the wine-bottle gag; the wedding-ring gag; the palm-reading gag; the roll-up-blinds gag; and the three-guys-in-two-beds gag." [...] Interspersed with these gags are extended character improvisations, such as Milda's discussion of Picasso, his mother's rants <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> table, and the factory supervisor's appeal for the army's support.|$|E
500|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room, Diane orders them to {{wait for}} dinner until the turkey is ready. As suppertime is passing, the turkey is still very undercooked and the {{trimmings}} have gone cold. Carla and Norm start blaming {{each other for the}} turkey's slow cooking. Norm throws some of Carla's peas at her, and she then throws carrots back at him. Cliff throws mashed yams at Frasier, who accidentally throws gravy skin back at Woody, intended for Cliff. The whole gang is poised to start a food fight until Diane stands up and tells them loudly to stop. When she is close to scolding them, Sam throws cranberry sauce at her, so the food fight resumes. By the time the food fight ends, the turkey is finally cooked. The gang calms down and decides to eat what they can. Diane comes out of the kitchen and throws a pumpkin pie to spite Sam for throwing cranberry sauce at her. The pie misses Sam but accidentally hits Vera as she enters. Vera tells Norm to fetch his coat, and Norm says, [...] "Yes, dear." ...|$|E

500|$|By the mid-1980s, ATV Music Publishing and Pye Records {{were both}} up for sale. The {{companies}} were bought relatively cheaply by Australian businessman Robert Holmes à Court, who acquired Associated Communications Corporation (the parent company) in 1982, asset-stripped the subsidiaries, and sacked many long serving employees before selling the companies on again. During this time, American singer Michael Jackson was recording [...] "Say Say Say" [...] for Paul McCartney's Pipes of Peace album. Jackson {{stayed at the}} home of McCartney and his wife Linda during the recording sessions, becoming friendly with both. One evening whilst <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> table, McCartney brought out a thick, bound notebook displaying all the songs to which he owned the publishing rights. Jackson grew more excited as he examined the pages. He inquired about how to buy songs and what the songs were used for. McCartney explained that music publishing was a way to make big money. Jackson replied by telling McCartney that he would buy The Beatles' songs one day. McCartney laughed, saying [...] "Great. Good joke." ...|$|E

25|$|Dining cars first {{appeared}} in the late 1870s and into the 1880s. Until this time, the common practice was to stop for meals <b>at</b> restaurants along <b>the</b> way (which led to the rise of Fred Harvey's chain of Harvey House restaurants in America). <b>At</b> first, <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> car was simply a place to serve meals that were picked up en route, but they soon evolved to include galleys in which the meals were prepared.|$|R
