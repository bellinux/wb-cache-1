40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to {{elucidate}} the effects of soil properties on arsenate adsorption by modeling the relationships between adsorption capacity and the properties of 16 Chinese soils. The model produced was validated against three Australian and three <b>American</b> <b>soils.</b> The results showed that nearly 93. 8 % of the variability in arsenate adsorption on the low-energy surface could be described by citrate-dithionite extractable Fe (Fe-CD), clay content, organic matter content (OM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC); nearly 87. 6 % of the variability in arsenate adsorption on the high-energy surface could be described by Fe-CD, DOC and total arsenic in soils. Fe-CD exhibited the most important positive influence on arsenate adsorption. Oxalate extractable Al (Al-OX), citrate-dithionite extractable Al (Al-CD) extractable P and soil pH appeared relatively unimportant for adsorption of arsenate by soils. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|In 1681, King Charles II gave Penn a {{large piece}} of his newly {{acquired}} American land holdings to repay a debt the king owed to Admiral Sir William Penn, Penn's father. This land included present-day Pennsylvania and Delaware, though the claim as written would create a bloody conflict with Maryland (dubbed Cresap's War) over the land grant already owned by Lord Baltimore. Penn put together a colonial expedition and fleet, which set out for America {{in the middle of the}} following summer. Penn, sailing in the vanguard, first set foot on <b>American</b> <b>soil</b> at the colony at New Castle, Delaware.

30|$|After {{the end of}} the Cold War, the US {{has become}} the undisputed global hegemon. Fukuyama (1992) was able to declare the End of History with liberal {{democracy}} as the ultimate form of governance. Ideologically claiming the moral high ground, the West set the structure of the global financial system, which is also regulated by the West, to reinforce the doctrine of liberal democracy at the expense of creating dependency in the developing world. Consequently, aid from the US is made conditional upon the recipients introducing liberal democratic reforms under the doctrine of the Washington Consensus. Yet, following the 911 terrorist attack on <b>American</b> <b>soils</b> in 2001, former US President George Bush had to ask “Why do they hate us?” a The US sub-prime crisis ultimately triggered the question of whether liberal democracy should be the universal norm of governances.|$|R
40|$|Modern land {{surface model}} {{simulations}} capture soil profile water movement {{through the use}} of soil hydraulics sub-models, but good hydraulic parameterisations are often lacking, especially in the tropics. We present much-improved gridded data sets of hydraulic parameters for surface soil for the critical area of tropical South America, describing soil profile water movement across the region to 30 cm depth. Optimal hydraulic parameter values are given for the Brooks and Corey, Campbell, van Genuchten–Mualem and van Genuchten–Burdine soil hydraulic models, which are widely used hydraulic sub-models in land surface models. This has been possible through interpolating soil measurements from several sources through the SOTERLAC soil and terrain data base and using the most recent pedotransfer functions (PTFs) derived for South <b>American</b> <b>soils.</b> All soil parameter data layers are provided at 15 arcsec resolution and available for download, this being 20 x higher resolution than the best comparable parameter maps available to date. Specific examples are given of the use of PTFs and the importance highlighted of using PTFs that have been locally parameterised and that are not just based on soil texture. We discuss current developments in soil hydraulic modelling and how high-resolution parameter maps such as these can improve the simulation of vegetation development and productivity in land surface models...|$|R
40|$|The Arctic soil organic-carbon pool is a significant, but poorly constrained, carbon store. The most cited pool size {{estimates}} {{are based on}} a study that severely undersamples Arctic soils, with only five out of the 48 soils examined actually from the Arctic region. Furthermore, previous measurements have been confined to the top 40 cm of soil. Here, we present 1 -m-deep measurements of soil organic carbon obtained at 117 locations in the North American Arctic region. To this dataset we add previously published measurements to generate a total sample size of 139 North <b>American</b> Arctic <b>soils.</b> We show that soil organic-carbon stores are highly dependent on landscape type, being highest in lowland and hilly upland soils, where values average 55. 1 and 40. 6 kg soil organic carbon m− 2 respectively, and lowest in rubbleland and mountain soils, where values average 3. 4 and 3. 8 kg soil organic carbon m− 2 respectively. Extrapolating ourmeasurements using known distributions of landscape types we estimate that the total organic carbon pool in North <b>American</b> Arctic <b>soils,</b> together with the average amount of carbon per unit area, is considerably higher than previously thought. Our estimates of the depth distribution and total amount of organic carbon in North <b>American</b> Arctic <b>soils</b> will form an important basis for studies examining the impact of climate warming on CO 2 release in the region.

5|$|The Oklahoma City {{bombing was}} a {{domestic}} terrorist truck bombing on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States on April 19, 1995. Perpetrated by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, the bombing killed 168 people, injured more than 680 others, and destroyed {{one-third of the}} building. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings within a 16-block radius, shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings, and destroyed or burned 86 cars, causing an estimated $652million worth of damage. Extensive rescue efforts were undertaken by local, state, federal, and worldwide agencies {{in the wake of}} the bombing, and substantial donations were received from across the country. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated eleven of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations.

5|$|There {{had been}} a degree of cross-fertilization between Canadian and American leagues earlier in the 20th century. A number of CFL–NFL interleague games were held in Canada. As well, eleven neutral-site CFL games have been played on <b>American</b> <b>soil.</b> The {{earliest}} of these dates to 1909, while the bulk occurred between 1951 and 1967.

The next game, a 1951 match-up between the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and Toronto Argonauts in Buffalo, was billed as the first true all-Canadian game played in the United States and drew more than 18,000, a decent crowd for the era. In 1958, Hamilton defeated Ottawa in a regular-season contest in front about 15,000 in Philadelphia's cavernous Municipal Stadium, 24–18. It remains the only CFL game played outside Canada, involving two Canadian teams, that actually counted in the standings.|$|E
5|$|Deep Purple {{arrived in}} California on 15 October 1968 and their first public {{appearance}} on <b>American</b> <b>soil</b> was at The Dating Game TV show on ABC on 17 October.

The next two days the band played live in the US {{for the first time as}} supporting act of Cream in their Goodbye tour. The concerts were held at the Inglewood Forum near Los Angeles, California, in front of more than 16,000 people every night. Recordings of those live shows were issued in 2002 as Inglewood – Live in California. The next gig at San Diego was the last one supporting Cream, whose management apparently did not appreciate the cheerful reaction of the audience to Deep Purple and dropped them. After a week of forced stop, their American manager succeeded in setting up a tour which included the San Francisco International Pop Festival and venues on the West Coast. This opportunity was very useful for the young musicians, who as headliners could lengthen their live shows up to 90 minutes and gained much needed experience on the road. This was particularly true for Blackmore, who developed and extended his guitar solos, incorporating more improvisations.|$|E
