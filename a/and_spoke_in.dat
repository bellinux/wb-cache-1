5|$|Elected in 1901 to the Senate, Neild was a {{vigorous}} supporter of old-age pensions, {{free trade and}} several other causes, but his ambitions of promotion were never realised. Passionately loyal to the British Empire, he questioned aspects of the White Australia policy <b>and</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> support {{of the children of}} Kanaka labourers facing deportation. His continued disputes with the military, including an attempt to have the commander of the Australian military forces found in contempt of Parliament, saw him lose respect among his colleagues and his later career was spent in comparative isolation. He lost his seat in 1910 and died the following year.|$|E
25|$|In the beginning, {{the provincial}} {{leadership}} of the Indian National Congress under Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari was strongly opposed to India's forcible involvement in the Second World War but later, Rajagopalachari changed his mind <b>and</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> support of the British war effort even while his colleagues in New Delhi were still agitating against the war.|$|E

25|$|Tjalie Robinson {{has been}} {{attributed}} to having single-handedly preserved the historic hybrid Indo culture of the Dutch East Indies in literature....with the wisdom of hindsight we now know that Tjalie Robinson {{was one of the most}} original writers of post war Dutch literature, that in the nick of time he secured something that otherwise would have been lost to us: how people felt, thought <b>and</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> the now lost world of the Indo community on Java. Rudy Kousbroek, 1989.|$|E
25|$|His legal career {{continued}} {{parallel to}} his political one. In 1820 {{he was one}} of the counsel retained by Queen Caroline, <b>and</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> her defence during her trial before the House of Lords. In 1828 he was appointed judge of the Consistory Court of London. In 1838 he was made a Privy Counsellor and became judge of the High Court of Admiralty, in which post he continued until 1867. He was also Dean of Arches from 1858 to 1867, when he retired from all his posts due to ill health.|$|E
25|$|In 1873 {{he was one}} of {{the founders}} of Mea Shearim, whose name he coined. His modus operandi was to buy a house in each new {{neighborhood}} that he helped establish, live in it for a while, and then move to a new home in the next neighborhood that he founded. In each neighborhood he supervised the purchase and construction of homes and assisted home buyers in acquiring loans. He also helped establish community institutions <b>and</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> the local synagogue. One of his sermons inspired a wealthy philanthropist named David Reiss to underwrite the founding of another neighborhood, Beit David, in 1873.|$|E

25|$|He {{returned}} to Parliament as the MP for Ilchester in 1820, and subsequently also represented Tregony, Winchelsea and Tower Hamlets. He continued to support all measures attempting to suppress slavery or the slave trade, and also proposed or attempted to propose motions to recognise {{the independence of}} South America from Spain (1820) and to abolish capital punishment (1840). He championed the cause of Jamaican anti-slavery activist Louis Celeste Lecesne, supported Catholic Emancipation <b>and</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> favour of repealing the civil disabilities which applied to Jews; {{he was also a}} strong supporter of Parliamentary reform, and advocated triennial parliaments and the secret ballot. He retired from Parliament in 1841.|$|E
25|$|On March 12, 2011, Giffords's husband {{informed}} her that six {{other people had}} been killed in the attack on her, but he did not identify who they were until months later. In late April, Giffords's doctors reported that her physical, cognitive, and language production abilities had improved significantly, placing her in the top 5 percent of patients recovering from similar injuries. She was walking under supervision with perfect control of her left arm and leg, and able to write with her left hand. She was able to read and understand, <b>and</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> short phrases. With longer efforts, she was able to produce more complex sentences.|$|E
25|$|Leahy was a {{longtime}} {{critic of the}} Iraq War, <b>and</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> favor of timetables for troop withdrawal, stating that the country needs well-trained employees in both foreign service and private industry to help repair damage to its civilian structure. He has {{been critical of the}} PATRIOT Act, even though he has voted to reauthorize altered versions of it. In June 2013, following the disclosure of PRISM and other covert surveillance activities by the National Security Agency, Leahy introduced a bill that would tighten guidelines related to the acquisition of FISA warrants for domestic surveillance and shorten the current FISA authorization by two years.|$|E

25|$|Serving three {{different}} tenures as Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations enabled Byrd to steer {{a great deal}} of federal money toward projects in West Virginia. Critics derided his efforts as pork barrel spending, while Byrd argued that the many federal projects he worked to bring to West Virginia represented progress for the people of his state. He filibustered against the 1964 Civil Rights Act and supported the Vietnam War, but later renounced racism and segregation, <b>and</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> opposition to the Iraq War. Renowned for his knowledge of Senate precedent and parliamentary procedure, Byrd wrote a four-volume history of the Senate in later life.|$|E
25|$|Having {{done much}} to damage the popular image and {{authority}} of constitutional nationalism, Healy after the Easter Rising {{was convinced that the}} IPP and Redmond were doomed and slowly withdrew from the forefront of politics, making it clear in 1917 that he was in general sympathy with Arthur Griffith's Sinn Féin movement, but not with physical force methods. In September that year he acted as counsel for the family of the dead Sinn Féin hunger striker Thomas Ashe. He {{was one of the few}} King's Counsel to provide legal services to members of Sinn Féin in various legal proceedings in both Ireland and England post the 1916 Rising. This included acting for those interned in 1916 illegally in Frongoch in North Wales. During this time, Healy also represented Georgina Frost, in her attempts to be appointed a Petty Sessions clerk in her native County Clare. In 1920 the Bar Council of Ireland passed an initial resolution that any barrister appearing before the Dáil Courts would be guilty of professional misconduct. This was challenged by Tim Healy and no final decision was made on the matter. Before the December 1918 general election, he was the first of the AFIL members to resign his seat in favour of the Sinn Féin party's candidate, <b>and</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> support of P. J. Little, the Sinn Féin candidate for Rathmines in Dublin.|$|E

500|$|Wilberforce's {{views of}} women and {{religion}} were also conservative. He disapproved of women anti-slavery activists such as Elizabeth Heyrick, who organised women's abolitionist groups in the 1820s, protesting: [...] "or ladies to meet, to publish, to go {{from house to house}} stirring up petitions– these appear to me proceedings unsuited to the female character as delineated in Scripture." [...] Wilberforce initially strongly opposed bills for Catholic emancipation, which would have allowed Catholics to become MPs, hold public office and serve in the army, although by 1813, he had changed his views <b>and</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> favour of a similar bill.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{version of}} the legend is a Dutch print about an Amsterdam woman named Jacamijntjen Jacobs. In 1621 Jacobs, while pregnant, was approached one day by a female beggar accompanied by three children, who pleaded that her children were starving. Jacobs told the beggar [...] "Take away your filthy pigs, I will not give you anything". The woman replied [...] "Are these my children pigs? May God then give you such pigs as I have here!" [...] Jacobs' daughter was born with the head and face of a pig, {{and at the time}} of publication in 1638–39 the daughter, by then in her teens, supposedly ate from a trough <b>and</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> a grunting voice.|$|E

She further stated that any [...] "guilty" [...] Wall Street bankers {{should be forced to}} give up any income over $100 million, be sent to re-education camps, or be executed by beheading if they resisted. Barr filed with the Federal Election Commission as a Green Party presidential candidate in January 2012. She formally announced her candidacy for the party's 2012 presidential nomination on February 2, 2012.|$|E
500|$|Before the 1973 {{election}} Gjems-Onstad {{advocated a}} restrictive immigration policy {{in an interview}} with Morgenbladet. After being elected to parliament, he was the sole member of the Finance Committee to oppose agreements of raising fuel taxes in 1973. He proposed steep budget cuts in 1974, notably in press support and in the Office of the Prime Minister. He proposed to abolish the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and Administration, as well as 22 laws the same year. Gjems-Onstad also wanted to abolish conscription. In 1975 he criticised parliament for violating the Norwegian Constitution by regularly holding session with {{less than half of the}} representatives present. Prime Minister Trygve Bratteli in turn claimed that Gjems-Onstad [...] "undermined democracy" [...] because he was present <b>and</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> parliament too much.|$|E
500|$|As {{president}} of the League to Enforce Peace, Taft hoped to prevent war through an international association of nations. [...] With World War I raging in Europe, Taft sent Wilson a note of support for his foreign policy in 1915. [...] President Wilson accepted Taft's invitation to address the league, <b>and</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> May 1916 of a postwar international organization that could prevent a repetition. Taft supported the effort to get Justice Hughes to resign from the bench and accept the Republican presidential nomination. Once this was done, Hughes tried to get Roosevelt and Taft to reconcile, as a united effort was needed to defeat Wilson. This occurred on October 3 in New York, but Roosevelt allowed only a handshake, and no words were exchanged. This {{was one of many}} difficulties for the Republicans in the campaign, and Wilson narrowly won re-election.|$|E
