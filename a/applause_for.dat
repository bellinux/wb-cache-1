Given has also helped organise several successful fundraising events, in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support. His {{mother died of}} cancer when he was five, so he has continually tried to raise money as {{it is an issue}} close to him. On 27 November 2011, Given was brought to tears during a minute's <b>applause</b> <b>for</b> former teammate and personal friend Gary Speed, following Speed's suicide earlier that day, before Aston Villa met Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium.|$|E
5|$|The first {{performance}} of Falstaff was at La Scala in Milan on 9 February 1893, nearly {{six years after}} Verdi's previous premiere. For the first night, official ticket prices were thirty times greater than usual. Royalty, aristocracy, critics and leading figures from the arts all over Europe were present. The performance was a huge success under the baton of Edoardo Mascheroni; numbers were encored, {{and at the end}} the <b>applause</b> <b>for</b> Verdi and the cast lasted an hour. That was followed by a tumultuous welcome when the composer, his wife and Boito arrived at the Grand Hotel de Milan.|$|E

Even more hectic scenes ensued when he went to Rome in May for the opera's premiere at the Teatro Costanzi, when crowds of well-wishers at the railway station initially forced Verdi to take refuge in a tool-shed. He witnessed the performance from the Royal Box at the side of King Umberto and the Queen.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} years Minna was the main wage earner in the household, having a {{successful}} career as a dramatic heroine who drew both <b>applause</b> <b>for</b> her abilities on stage and admirers for her beauty. She shared {{in many of the}} escapades of Wagner's life, including a perilous sea voyage to London, poverty in Paris, and following him around Europe after his involvement in the Dresden uprising of 1849, which led to his banishment from Germany.|$|E
25|$|During {{that time}} he {{remained}} busy, spending some time with Turina (who was ill for part of it), visiting the conservatory and meeting {{with many of the}} students and his old teacher, Zingarelli (to whom he had dedicated Norma), and attending a performance of Capuleti at the San Carlo with Turina and Florimo on 5 February in the presence of King Ferdinand II. The King led the <b>applause</b> <b>for</b> the composer, resulting in his being called to the stage and thus enjoying a very warm welcome from the people of Naples.|$|E

25|$|The {{debate is}} famous {{due to the}} fact that Newt Gingrich spent three minutes yelling at the {{moderator}} at the beginning of the debate after Gingrich was asked a question about whether he had been asked to enter into an open marriage. Gingrich felt that the question was an extremely unfair way to begin a presidential debate and was an attempt to protect President Barack Obama. The incident resulted in a great amount of <b>applause</b> <b>for</b> Gingrich, and was widely broadcast on YouTube. It was also credited with raising Gingrich's support in South Carolina, leading to his win in that state's primary two days later.|$|E
25|$|In 1857 Santley {{returned}} to London, {{and made his}} first appearance (16 November) for John Hullah {{in the role of}} Adam in Haydn's Creation: it is related that he broke down in the duet Graceful Consort owing to nerves, but the audience burst into <b>applause</b> <b>for</b> him and bade him continue. Manuel García, who heard him, offered training which Santley accepted gratefully. There were a few concerts at the Crystal Palace and elsewhere, under Chorley's guidance, and at a Chorley party he met Gertrude Kemble, who became his wife a year later. Through her he was introduced to the salon of Henry Greville, at whose musical parties he joined company with Mario, Giulia Grisi, Italo Gardoni, Ciro Pinsuti and others.|$|E
25|$|After {{arriving}} in France, Monroe addressed the National Convention, receiving a standing <b>applause</b> <b>for</b> his speech celebrating republicanism. He experienced several early diplomatic successes, including {{the protection of}} U.S. trade from French attacks. He also used his influence to win the release of Thomas Paine and Adrienne de La Fayette, {{the wife of the}} Marquis de Lafayette. Months after Monroe arrived in France, the U.S. and Great Britain concluded the Jay Treaty, outraging both the French and Monroe—not fully informed about the treaty prior to its publication. Despite the undesirable effects of the Jay Treaty on Franco-American relations, Monroe won French support for U.S. navigational rights on the Mississippi River—the mouth of which was controlled by Spain—and in 1795 the U.S. and Spain signed Pinckney's Treaty. The treaty granted the U.S. limited rights to use the port of New Orleans.|$|E

50|$|At {{the judging}} panel, Marie was <b>applaused</b> <b>for</b> her best photo, Josephine and Nicole also excelled, {{securing}} {{the top three}} position. Katarina was praised as she was deemed finally improved by the judges. Natalie, Jodilly and Tia found themselves in bottom three; Natalie for looking lost in the photo, Jodilly for the disconnection between her face and body, and Tia for not listening at the photographer and mentor during the shoot. Natalie was later deemed safe, leaving the tearful Jodilly and Tia in bottom two. Even though she won the challenge this week, Tia was sent home, sparing Jodilly from the elimination.|$|R

500|$|His Irish Symphony of 1866 won {{similarly}} enthusiastic praise, but as Arthur Jacobs notes, [...] "The first rapturous {{outburst of}} enthusiasm for Sullivan as an orchestral composer did not last." [...] A comment typical {{of those that}} followed him throughout his career was that [...] "Sullivan's unquestionable talent should make him doubly careful not to mistake popular <b>applause</b> <b>for</b> artistic appreciation." ...|$|E
500|$|While Clinton was {{president}} in 1994, {{he received an}} honorary degree and a fellowship from the University of Oxford, specifically for being [...] "a doughty and tireless champion of the cause of world peace", having [...] "a powerful collaborator in his wife," [...] and for winning [...] "general <b>applause</b> <b>for</b> his achievement of resolving the gridlock that prevented an agreed budget".|$|E

5000|$|Salman Gambarov is a {{creative}} person without habitual frames. His jazz is colorful and fine. It is interesting for many, but not understandable for everybody, because Salman does not play with public <b>for</b> <b>applause.</b> His aspiration <b>for</b> folk jazz {{is revealed in}} a soundtrack written by film to a silent film [...] "Latif" [...] and also in a [...] "East or West?"

500|$|Although Illinois is {{a concept}} album about the U.S. state, Stevens also {{explored}} themes related to Christianity and the Bible. As a Christian, he has written and recorded music about spiritual themes throughout his career—particularly on the 2004 album Seven Swans—and prefers to talk about religious topics through song rather than directly in interviews or public statements. The song [...] "Decatur, or, Round of <b>Applause</b> <b>for</b> Your Stepmother!" [...] includes the line [...] "It's the great I Am"—taken from the response God gave when Moses asked for {{his name in the}} Book of Exodus (...) [...] [...] "Casimir Pulaski Day" [...] describes the death of a romantic partner due to bone cancer, and the narrator questions God in the process. More abstract allusions appear in [...] "The Man of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts", which utilizes Superman as a Christ figure and [...] "The Seer's Tower", which references the Book of Revelation and the Second Coming of Christ. Songs which were not written with an explicit theological focus—such as [...] "John Wayne Gacy, Jr."—also feature religious themes such as sin and redemption.|$|E
500|$|In {{his final}} decade, the most {{fruitful}} of his compositional career despite his deafness and increasing ill-health, Smetana belatedly received national recognition. Of his later operas, The Two Widows and The Secret were warmly received, while The Kiss {{was greeted by}} an [...] "overwhelming ovation". The ceremonial opera Libuše was received with thunderous <b>applause</b> <b>for</b> the composer; by this time (1881) the disputes around his music had declined, and the public was ready to honour him as the founder of Czech music. Nevertheless, the first few performances in October 1882 of an evidently under-rehearsed The Devil's Wall were chaotic, and the composer was left feeling [...] "dishonoured and dispirited." [...] This disappointment was swiftly mitigated by the acclaim that followed the first performance of the complete Má vlast cycle in November: [...] "Everyone {{rose to his feet}} and the same storm of unending applause was repeated after each of the six parts... At the end of Blaník [...] the audience was beside itself and the people could not bring themselves to take leave of the composer." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Casimir Pulaski Day" [...] interweaves a {{personal}} story {{with the state}} holiday Casimir Pulaski Day. [...] "The Man of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts" [...] makes references to Superman, whose fictional hometown of Metropolis was partially modeled after Chicago (the town of Metropolis, Illinois has also capitalized on this association). Jessica Hopper of the Chicago Reader noted that Ray Middleton—who was the first actor to play the comic book superhero—was also born in Chicago. [...] "They Are Night Zombies!! They Are Neighbors!! They Have Come Back from the Dead!! Ahhhh!" [...] makes references to ghost towns of Illinois. Stevens relates experiences from a summer camp he went to {{as a child in}} Michigan for [...] "The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades Is Out to Get Us!", but moved the locale to Illinois {{for the sake of the}} album. The track [...] "Decatur, or, Round of <b>Applause</b> <b>for</b> Your Stepmother!" [...] includes references to Decatur, Illinois, but Stevens stated the track also acted as [...] "an exercise in rhyme schemes". Some references to Decatur included in the song were alligator sightings in the area, the equipment manufacturer Caterpillar, and a flood that exhumed a graveyard of soldiers from the Civil War.|$|E
