40|$|Agriculture employs <b>about</b> <b>three-quarter</b> of Nigeria's {{workforce}} and yet food sufficiency {{is a challenge}} in the country. This {{is largely due to}} poor and outdated pre-harvest and post-harvest farming practices. The land fallow system is still been practised as fertiliser production in the country is grossly inadequate and expensive. The few available post-harvest processing facilities are faced with ageing and are inefficient. Also, use of modern processing equipment is limited by farmers' lack of fund, adequate capacity to operate and maintain modern farming equipment. This paper, therefore, examines key barriers to agricultural products processing equipment in the country. These barriers include over-dependence on foreign technologies and expertise; poor and inadequate manufacturing infrastructure; and lack of political will by political leaders; lack of funds; and lack of adequate technical skills. This paper, however, sees the increase in the domestic manufacturing of pre-harvest and post-harvest machinery and equipment through reverse engineering approach as a key to food production sufficiency in Nigeria...|$|R

5|$|The barbarisation theory, {{ultimately}} {{derived from}} Edward Gibbon's 18th-century magnum opus, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, contains two propositions. (1) That the late army recruited much {{greater numbers of}} barbarian-born troops than {{the army of the}} Principate; and (2) that the greater number of barbarian recruits resulted in a major decline of the army's effectiveness and was a leading factor in the collapse of the Western Roman empire. As discussed above, proposition (1) is probably correct, although it should be borne in mind that probably <b>about</b> <b>three-quarters</b> of the late army's recruits remained Roman-born.

5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, <b>about</b> <b>three-quarters</b> of the Oroville-Chico Highway {{was absorbed}} by other routes.

In the early 1960s, U.S. Route 40 Alternate (Legislative Route 21, now SR 70) was relocated due to the damming of Lake Oroville across its old alignment. The bridge over the West Branch Feather River northwest of the dam opened in August 1962, resulting in US 40 Alt. using the Oroville-Chico Highway (which was relocated to a new four-lane freeway alignment) south of Wicks Corner.

5|$|<b>About</b> <b>three-quarters</b> {{of dietary}} calcium is from dairy {{products}} and grains, the rest being {{accounted for by}} vegetables, protein-rich foods, fruits, sugar, fats, and oil. Calcium supplementation is controversial, as the bioavailability of calcium {{is strongly dependent on}} the solubility of the salt involved: calcium citrate, malate, and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is much less so. The intestine absorbs about one-third of calcium eaten as the free ion, and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys. Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition of calcium ions there, allowing rapid bone turnover without affecting bone mass or mineral content. When plasma calcium levels fall, cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of parathyroid hormone occurs; it then proceeds to stimulate the entry of calcium into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney, gut, and bone cells, with the bone-forming action of parathyroid hormone being antagonised by calcitonin, whose secretion increases with increasing plasma calcium levels.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of obesity is increasing in both developed and developing countries. Obesity is associated with increased risks of many diseases. Obesity significantly affects {{the quality of life}} and reduces the average life expectancy. Objective: Investigate effect of different environment urban and rural areas in El Bihera governorate on blood glucose level and obesity of children aged 6 - 12 years to know possible associated risk factors. Study design: This study of a representative sample of children 6 - 12 y of age performed during 1 July 2004 till 20 June 2005. Methods: Anthropometric data were taken using standard methods, from 188 children. Certain diet and physical activities as well as other socioeconomic family parameters were assessed {{with the aid of a}} questionnaire. Obesity and overweight were defined using both the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) I definition and the new International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) definition. Logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the influence of various parameters. Results: obesity was prevalent among girls 13. 8 and 11. 7 % than boys 12. 7 and 13. 8 % in urban and ruler areas respectively. The high percentage of boys and girls in both urban and rural (78. 0 % and 84. 2 % respectively and 83. 3 % and 89. 8 % respectively), who take snacks in between meals. Also the results show that <b>about</b> <b>three-quarter</b> of the urban boys (70. 7 %) and more than half of rural boys (65. 8 %) eating during T. V watching. The results show that about two-third (58. 3 %) of the urban girls and <b>about</b> <b>three-quarter</b> (67. 3 %) of the rural girls eating during T. V watching with significant differences only among the urban groups (P 0. 020). on the other hand, the plasma glucose values of all cases (normal and obese) in urban and rural areas were significantly different. In boys and girls subjects in rural and urban areas there were no significant differences between the mean values of plasma TSH. However, a significant difference between the plasma TC of urban areas than that of rural areas at the same age group was detected. There was a significant difference for the mean values of plasma TC level between normal and obese groups in the rural site. Conclusion: The good news is that schools can help students and staff adopts healthy eating and physical activity behaviors that are the keys to preventing obesity...|$|R

5|$|The {{uprising}} {{spread to}} Jerusalem, Hebron and other mountainous areas {{in what is}} today known as the West Bank. Although Nablus was {{the core of the}} rebels' strength, the first actual clash between the authorities and the rebels occurred in the vicinity of Hebron after a group of Egyptian soldiers were sent by the Egyptian governor of Hebron to enforce the draft orders. Local peasants from the nearby village of Sa'ir and Bedouin fighters from the Bethlehem-based Ta'amirah tribe joined forces and killed some 25 soldiers during the fighting, defeating Ibrahim Pasha's forces in the area. Prior to this clash, peasants and local Bedouin took up arms against the Egyptian army in al-Salt, the Transjordanian center of the Nablus-based Tuqan family. Following these confrontations, the Egyptian Army's Nineteenth Regiment under Mustafa Bey came under rebel assault in the Jezreel Valley en route to the Galilee. <b>About</b> <b>three-quarters</b> of the regiment's roughly 1,200 soldiers were killed or captured, and Mustafa Bey was wounded.

5|$|Because of {{the rugged}} terrain and rough waters {{on the two}} rivers, {{especially}} on the glacier-fed Kootenay, steamboat operation was extremely difficult and proved {{to be anything but}} cost effective. The roughest water was in Jennings Canyon, now mostly submerged in the Lake Koocanusa reservoir behind Libby Dam. Two of the first steamers, the Duchess and the Cline, both sank when transporting miners to the Wild Horse gold rush on the Kootenay. Both ships had not even reached Canal Flats when they hit rocks in the Columbia. The first steamboat to actually run the Kootenay was the Annerly in 1893. Later vessels, such as the Gwendoline, had mixed success. Captain Frank P. Armstrong, who had piloted several earlier steamboats on the Golden-Jennings run, was her builder and when she was <b>about</b> <b>three-quarters</b> completed, Armstrong decided to take her to Golden to complete the job. Gwendoline sailed up to the canal, which unfortunately was unusable because the gates of the lock had been dynamited due to a Kootenay flood. Armstrong was forced to portage the vessel and eventually made it to Golden. Gwendoline eventually sailed back south to Jennings to haul iron ore on the Kootenay. She was also the only ship to ever travel through the canal by proper means, and made two of the only three steamboat trips through the canal.|$|E
5|$|By October 1951, the {{estimated}} completion date for Victoriouss modernisation {{was already a}} year past the initial estimate of April 1954. Implacable was scheduled to begin her modernisation in April 1953 for completion in 1956, but the Director of Dockyards pointed out that existing schedules prevented her from beginning any earlier than April 1955 unless the modernisations of two cruisers and the guided missile test ship RFA Girdle Ness were delayed. The Controller of the Navy asked if the time and cost of the reconstruction could be reduced, but the minimum modifications were the most expensive as they involved structural alterations. The Controller ordered the Director of Dockyards to plan for rebuilding Implacable between June 1953 and December 1956 even after the latter protested that even a limited modernisation would require <b>about</b> <b>three-quarters</b> of the structural work of the original plan and that the shortage of skilled workers (already insufficient for Victorious by herself) would delay work on both ships. In {{order to reduce the}} amount of structural work, the requirement to replace the boilers was cancelled and the ship would receive existing radars instead of systems then still under development. In January 1952, the ship's new armament was finalized at six twin-gun 3"/70 mounts and three sextuple Bofors mounts. Five months later the Admiralty decided that Victorious would be the last fleet carrier modernised as experience showed that the process would take longer and cost more than was practicable.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{power of}} the modern mass media {{is not limited to}} its ability to {{communicate}} information and entertain but derives primarily from its ability to define situations, thereby enabling it to construct social reality. Stigma is related to negative stereotyping and prejudicial attitudes that in turn lead to discriminatory practices. Aims: The study sought to know the perceptions of and attitudes of mass communication students towards mental illness and the mentally ill. Settings and Design: The study population comprised of final year Diploma students of Mass Communication of a foremost tertiary institution in Nigeria. Methods and Material: The World Psychiatric Association questionnaire measuring attitudes towards Schizophrenia was modified and administered to the students. Results: Study also showed only one-fifth of all respondents had contact with either an advert or a promotion about mental illness. <b>About</b> <b>three-quarter</b> (74. 1 %) of those who had come in contact with information on mental illness had done so through audiovisuals including television and radio. More than half of the students ranked environmental factors foremost among causes of mental illness. Majority of the students (85. 9 %) would definitely not marry someone with mental illness. Conclusions: The enormous potential and influence the media has on mental health issues would require that mental health professionals provide great input into the enlightenment program for these young and mental health-naïve potential image makers...|$|R
