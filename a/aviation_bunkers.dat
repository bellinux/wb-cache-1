40|$|Co-feeding lignocellulosic-biomass-derived {{intermediates}} into conventional refineries is {{a promising}} option to decarbonise automotive, <b>aviation</b> and <b>bunker</b> fuels {{and to reduce}} import-dependence of mobility. Of course, this strictly requires compatibility of bio-based intermediates with the refining process and especially consistency of the intermediates’ properties. The ultimate goal {{of this approach is}} the production of fuels of high-quality abiding by the standards, with no intermediate-caused off-spec batches lowering the refineries’ yields...|$|R

Well camouflaged by pine trees, the inground, steel roofed {{cylindrical}} brick bunker was served by a hidden rail siding. The fuel capacity was estimated at 700,000 imperial gallons. The bunker also served the nearby and more visible RNZAF Norwood satellite airbase.|$|R

Due to low prices of diesel oil, nuclear {{propulsion}} is rare except in some Navy and specialist vessels such as icebreakers. In large aircraft carriers, the space formerly used for ship's bunkerage could be used instead to <b>bunker</b> <b>aviation</b> fuel. In submarines, the ability to run submerged at high speed and in relative quiet for long periods holds obvious advantages. A few cruisers have also employed nuclear power; as of 2006, the only ones remaining in service are the Russian [...] An example of a non-military ship with nuclear marine propulsion is the [...] with [...] Commercial experiments such as [...] have so far proved uneconomical compared with conventional propulsion.|$|R
