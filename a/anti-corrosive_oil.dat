It was known axle material was coated with <b>anti-corrosive</b> <b>oil.</b> Oils were examined through ICP-AES, and then compared to the composition found {{on the surface of}} the steel samples. Elements found in the oils vastly differed from one another. One of the oils contains large amounts of aluminium while the other contains high levels of calcium. When samples surfaces were analysed using EDS, phases consisting of aluminium and calcium were observed. These results indicate that the wrong anti-corrosive had been used for the axle material which gave substandard welds. The oil used contained elements with a low vaporisation temperature, such as calcium. This causes instabilities in the keyhole, leading to collapse. Collapse of the keyhole facilitates the formation of defects...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a master}} thesis project {{conducted}} for Scania CV AB in collaboration with Swerea Kimab. The purpose is to examine how oils and coatings on the surface aﬀect the adhesion of adhesives. Earlier work done by Scania indicate {{that the amount of}} oil applied may {{have an impact on the}} adhesion. Substrates tested are hot dipped galvanised steel, electro galvanised. AlSi and ZnMg. Oils used are Anticorit RP 3802 that is an <b>anti-corrosive</b> <b>oil</b> and Renoform 3802 that is a drawing oil. The two adhesives used are Betamate 1496 f and SikaPower 498. The performance of adhesive bonds is strongly dependent on the surface it adheres to and any contam-inates such as oil present on the surface. These factors may greatly decrease the performance of the bond. There are adhesives that have been designed to tolerate a speciﬁc amount of oil on the surfaces and should develop a satisfactory bond with oil present. This project has ﬁrstly developed a routine for easy application of oil with the result of a known amount of oil and a uniform oil distribution on the surface of the coated sample. Secondly lap-shear tests have been performed for various amounts and types of oil in combination with four diﬀerent coatings and two adhesives. For the evaluation of failure mode a program using k-mean factoring was written to provide an objective method to characterise the bond. Lap-shear tests show that there does not seem to be any apparent diﬀerence in bond strength for various amounts of oil and for the two diﬀerent adhesives except for one combination. Even thought the two adhesives develop the same strength the failure mode diﬀers between the two...|$|E
