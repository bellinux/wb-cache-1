5|$|If Mussorgsky's {{compositions}} <b>are</b> <b>destined</b> to live unfaded {{for fifty}} years after their author's death (when all his works will become the property of any and every publisher), such an archeologically accurate edition will always be possible, as the manuscripts went to the Public Library on leaving me. For the present, though, there was need of an edition for performances, for practical artistic purposes, for making his colossal talent known, {{and not for the}} mere studying of his personality and artistic sins.|$|E

5|$|Let us {{bring up}} women, not {{to aspire to}} {{advantages}} which the Constitution denies them, but to know and appreciate those which it guarantees them... Men <b>are</b> <b>destined</b> {{to live on the}} stage of the world. A public education suits them: it early places before their eyes all the scenes of life: only the proportions are different. The paternal home is better for the education of women; they have less need to learn to deal with the interests of others, than to accustom themselves to a calm and secluded life.|$|E
5|$|Embryos {{produced}} {{using in}} vitro fertilization may be genetically tested for HD using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then tested for the genetic abnormality, can then be used to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or exclusion testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring without revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves <b>are</b> <b>destined</b> to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryos' DNA is {{compared with that of}} the parents and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In non-disclosure testing, only disease-free embryos are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.|$|E
5|$|The rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia, {{which the}} Sumatran rhino inhabits, are also targets for {{legal and illegal}} logging because of the {{desirability}} of their hardwoods. Rare woods such as merbau, meranti and semaram are valuable on the international markets, fetching as much as $1,800perm3 ($1,375percuyd). Enforcement of illegal-logging laws is difficult because humans live within or near {{many of the same}} forests as the rhino. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake has been used to justify new logging. Although the hardwoods in the rainforests of the Sumatran rhino <b>are</b> <b>destined</b> for international markets and not widely used in domestic construction, the number of logging permits for these woods has increased dramatically because of the tsunami. However, while this species has been suggested to be highly sensitive to habitat disturbance, apparently it is of little importance compared to hunting, as it can withstand more or less any forest condition.|$|E

After he attacks Kendra and Cisco Ramon, Barry Allen takes Kendra to Star City and enlists {{the help of}} Oliver Queen and his team to protect her. The team is visited by Malcolm Merlyn who informs them that Savage is an immortal. Later, Kendra is kidnapped by Hawkman, but Barry and Oliver rescue her and capture him. He {{introduces}} himself as Carter Hall, and tells them he and Kendra are soulmates who have been connected for millennia. They <b>are</b> <b>destined</b> to die, be reborn, and find each other in each lifetime. Carter also reveals that Savage has killed the pair several times, each time growing stronger. Savage acquires the Staff of Horus, a deadly weapon. Kendra unlocks her abilities and becomes Hawkgirl and the team decides to regroup in Central City. Oliver witnesses his ex-girlfriend Samantha Clayton with her son William, and realizes the child is likely his. Meanwhile, Caitlin Snow and Harrison Wells create a serum that will temporarily increase Barry's speed {{so that he can}} defeat Zoom. Jay Garrick initially refuses to test the serum, but changes his mind to save Wells when he is shot by Patty Spivot unaware that he is an Earth-2 doppelgänger. Jay advises against using the serum on Barry.|$|E

25|$|The North American Free Trade Agreement {{has a great}} {{influence}} on transborder trade in the San Diego–Tijuana economy. Of all the goods exchanged to the north 20% transported <b>are</b> <b>destined</b> for San Diego, 60% <b>are</b> <b>destined</b> for other California counties, and the remaining 20% <b>are</b> <b>destined</b> to other American states. The metropolitan economy has become increasingly integrated as the NAFTA process has reduced trade and investment barriers which facilitates the trade and extensive sales services via cross-border exchange. San Diego–Tijuana is a critical commercial link to the United States. In Tijuana, companies that have established assembly plants in industrial parks referred to as maquiladoras include Sony, Toyota, Samsung, Kodak, Matsushita/Panasonic, Nabisco, Philips, Pioneer, Plantronics, Pall Corporation, Tara Labs, and Sanyo, while San Diego supports the expansion of its own industrial parks in Otay Mesa. Additionally some of these companies, such as Samsung, source the development of items locally.|$|E

25|$|In the Anguttara Nikaya (5:33), Buddha tells future wives {{that they}} should be obedient to their husbands, please them, and not make them angry through their own desires. Furthermore, the Buddha offers advice to married women in the Anguttara Nikaya (7:59; IV 91-94), from the Pali (Theravada) canon, where he tells of seven types of wives—the first three types <b>are</b> <b>destined</b> for unhappiness, while the last four, as they are imbued with long term self-control, <b>are</b> <b>destined</b> to be happy. These latter wives are characterised as caretakers (motherly-wife), companions (friend-wife) and submissives (sister-wife and slave-wife)—the Buddha thus {{endorsed}} a variety of types of wives within marriage.|$|E
