5|$|Rooted in the 1980s {{hardcore}} punk scene, Butthole Surfers {{quickly became}} {{known for their}} chaotic and disturbing live shows, black comedy, and <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> incorporated elements of psychedelia, noise rock, punk and, later, electronica, {{as well as their}} use of sound manipulation and tape editing.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{tour with}} Elliot Minor, {{the writing process}} for the new album began. Although all the music's writing was {{credited}} to the entire band, vocalist Josh Franceschi and guitarist Max Helyer were usually the biggest creative forces among the group, being responsible for the ideas behind the songs. The band's work resulted in the album having <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> most critics associated with pop punk, though this result was unintended. The album was recorded in two weeks at Outhouse Studios in Reading, Berkshire with producers Matt O'Grady and John Mitchell.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{music was}} {{performed}} by the then-unknown group Earth, Wind & Fire, who {{were living in a}} single apartment with hardly any food at the time. Van Peebles' secretary was dating one of the bandmembers, and convinced him to contact them about performing the music for the film. Van Peebles projected scenes from the film as the band performed the music. By alternating hymn-based vocalization and jazz rhythms, Van Peebles created <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> foreshadowed the use of sampling in hip hop music.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> vowel <b>sound</b> whose quality {{does not}} change over the {{duration}} of the vowel is called a monophthong. Monophthongs are sometimes called [...] "pure" [...] or [...] "stable" [...] vowels. <b>A</b> vowel <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> glides from one quality to another is called a diphthong, and <b>a</b> vowel <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> glides successively through three qualities is a triphthong.|$|R

5|$|Seattle in {{this period}} {{attracted}} widespread attention as home to these many companies, but also by hosting the 1990 Goodwill Games and the APEC leaders conference in 1993, {{as well as through}} the worldwide popularity of grunge, <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> had developed in Seattle's independent music scene. Another bid for worldwide attention—hosting the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999—garnered visibility, but not in the way its sponsors desired, as related protest activity and police reactions to those protests overshadowed the conference itself. The city was further shaken by the Mardi Gras Riots in 2001, and then literally shaken the following day by the Nisqually earthquake.|$|E
25|$|Brooklyn Series - The Gretsch drum {{design team}} molded the Brooklyn series by {{combining}} classic Gretsch elements while infusing it with new attributes. They expanded upon traditional drum designs to shape <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> retains fundamental Gretsch characteristics while projecting a fresh voice.|$|E
25|$|Players {{generally}} need {{to learn}} the basic sounds and traditional rhythm samples (4/4 and 12/8) {{to be able to}} follow classes.

25|$|East Coast thrash metal: Centered in New York City, the East Coast's thrash metal {{tended to}} display <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> {{incorporated}} a strong hardcore punk influence. An emphasis {{was placed on}} aggression and speed rather than technicality. Anthrax, Overkill, Nuclear Assault, Toxik, and Whiplash exemplified the style to emerge from this regional scene.|$|E
25|$|MRC Riddims is the DJ/production team of Alap Now and Merc Anthony. In 2009 Alap began {{collaborating with}} {{longtime}} friend Merc, {{who was a}} member of the shoegaze band All Natural Lemon and Lime Flavors. The two began exploring <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> sought to fuse Jamaican Dancehall and House music.|$|E
25|$|Charly, Moro, Lebón, and Aznar managed {{two major}} things with Serú Girán. The first {{was to create}} <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> was truly {{distinctive}} from anything in English-language rock. The second was their ability to massively achieve popularity in the lower and upper classes with their style of rock. Serú Girán could be 'brainy' yet unpretentious rockers simultaneously.|$|E

25|$|He {{was also}} (with Davis, Konitz and Barber) {{one of only}} four musicians who played on all the recordings. Despite the chilly {{reception}} by audiences of 1949, the Davis nonet has been judged by history {{as one of the}} most influential groups in jazz history, creating <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that,</b> despite its East Coast origins, became known as West Coast Jazz.|$|E
25|$|Wheels and knobs: Used to add {{effects to}} <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> are not present by default, such as vibrato, panning, tremolo, pitch bending, and so on. A common wheel on {{contemporary}} keyboards is the pitch bend, adjusting {{the pitch of}} a note usually {{in the range of}} ±1 tone. The pitch bend wheel is usually on the left of the keyboard and is a spring-loaded potentiometer.|$|E
25|$|Modern composers {{will often}} specify the beating spot {{to alter the}} sound of the drum. When the timpani are struck {{directly}} in the center, they have <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> is almost completely devoid of tone and resonance. George Gershwin uses this effect in An American in Paris. Struck close to the edge, timpani produce a very thin, hollow sound. This effect is used by composers such as Bartók, Bernstein, and Kodály.|$|E

2500|$|Best (1995) {{proposed}} a Perceptual Assimilation Model which describes possible cross-language category assimilation patterns and predicts their consequences. Flege (1995) formulated a Speech Learning Model which combines several hypotheses about second-language (L2) speech acquisition and which predicts, in simple words, <b>that</b> <b>an</b> L2 <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> {{is not too}} similar to <b>a</b> native-language (L1) <b>sound</b> {{will be easier to}} acquire than <b>an</b> L2 <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> is relatively similar to <b>an</b> L1 <b>sound</b> (because it will be perceived as more obviously [...] "different" [...] by the learner).|$|R

25|$|Plank {{was one of}} {{the first}} 'name' {{producers}} to favour a very 'live' production sound, especially on drums, <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> was strikingly opposed to the dense and heavily compressed drum sound that dominated rock recording in the 70s. Plank's open, sometimes clangorous drum and percussion sounds undoubtedly had a significant influence on producers and engineers like Steve Lillywhite, Hugh Padgham and Nick Launay. On a recording session in Hamburg in 1970 with Hartmut Kulka from the German Blue Flames & Philip Cantlay late of Casey Jones & the Governors/Gaslight Union, together known as Kulka & Cantlay, he set up and recorded conga drums with specially inserted microphones to provide an unusual percussion sound.|$|E
25|$|Pulsatile {{tinnitus}} can be {{a symptom}} of intracranial vascular abnormalities and should be evaluated for irregular noises of blood flow (bruits). Some people experience <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> beats in time with their pulse (pulsatile tinnitus, or vascular tinnitus). Pulsatile tinnitus is usually objective in nature, resulting from altered blood flow, increased blood turbulence near the ear (such as from atherosclerosis, venous hum, {{but it can also}} arise as a subjective phenomenon from an increased awareness of blood flow in the ear. Rarely, pulsatile tinnitus may be a symptom of potentially life-threatening conditions such as carotid artery aneurysm or carotid artery dissection. Pulsatile tinnitus may also indicate vasculitis, or more specifically, giant cell arteritis. Pulsatile tinnitus may also be an indication of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.|$|E
25|$|A Voice and Text Director is {{assigned}} to every play from pre-production through the opening performance. OSF employs two full-time voice and text directors {{and one or two}} guest artists each year to meet the demand for these specialists. They help the actors and directors craft vocal choices that will be theatrically effective and sustainable through the run of the show. This can involve work on posture, breath support, resonant placement, muscularity of articulation and screaming technique. They also work with the actors on the text of the play, often in one-on-one sessions. This can include examination of meter, rhythm, sound patterning such as alliteration and rhyme, imagery, and rhetorical structure and devices such as antithesis and repetition. When required, they coach the actors in accents and dialects based on samples of native speakers and work with each actor to find <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> is as authentic as possible to the character's background but also intelligible in a contemporary theatrical context and conducive to that individual's acting process.|$|E
