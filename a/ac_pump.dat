40|$|Controlling {{electrons}} at {{the level}} of elementary charge $e$ has been demonstrated experimentally already in the 1980 's. Ever since, producing an electrical current $ef$, or its integer multiple, at a drive frequency $f$ has been in a focus of research for metrological purposes. In this review we first discuss the generic physical phenomena and technical constraints that influence charge transport. We then present the broad variety of proposed realizations. Some of them have already proven experimentally to nearly fulfill the demanding needs, in terms of transfer errors and transfer rate, of quantum metrology of electrical quantities, whereas some others are currently "just" wild ideas, still often potentially competitive if technical constraints can be lifted. We also discuss the important issues of read-out of single-electron events and potential error correction schemes based on them. Finally, we give an account of the status of single-electron current sources in the bigger framework of electric quantum standards and of the future international SI system of units, and briefly discuss the applications and uses of single-electron devices outside the metrological context.

40|$|Excitations in disordered {{systems are}} {{typically}} categorized as localized or delocalized, {{depending on whether}} they entail disturbances extending throughout the system or are confined to small, generally nanometer scale, subsystems. Such categorization is impossible to achieve using traditional spectroscopy where the response to a weak oscillating (ac) electromagnetic probe is measured {{as a function of}} frequency. However, the localized excitations can be separated from each other as well as the delocalized continuum by measuring a spectral "hole" in the ordinary response while a large amplitude pump is imposed at a fixed frequency. Localized excitations will result in a very sharp "hole," and any residual couplings to other excitations, both localized and extended, will determine its detailed shape. This technique probes incoherent lifetime effects as well as coherent mixing or quantum interference phenomena, describable in terms of the Fano effect. Here we show that in a disordered Ising magnet, LiHo$_{ 0. 045 }$Y$_{ 0. 955 }$F$_ 4 $, the quality factor $Q$ for spectral holes, the ratio of the drive frequency to their width, can be as high as 100, 000. In addition, we can tune the dynamics of the quantum degrees of freedom by sweeping the quantum mixing parameter through zero via the amplitude of the <b>ac</b> <b>pump</b> as well as a static external transverse field. The zero-crossing is associated with a dissipationless response at the drive frequency. The identification of such a point where localized degrees of freedom are minimally mixed with their environment in a dense and disordered dipolar coupled spin system implies control over the bath coupling of qubits emerging from strongly interacting many-body systems.

40|$|Abstract The most {{important}} paradigms in quantum mechanics are probably a twolevel system, a harmonic oscillator and an ideal (infinite) periodic potential. The first two provide {{a starting point}} for understanding the phenomena in systems where the spectrum of energy levels is discrete, whereas the last one results in continuous energy bands. Here an attempt is made to study the dynamics of the electrons in a narrow miniband of a semiconductor superlattice under electric and magnetic fields. Semiconductor superlattices are artificial periodic structures, where certain properties like the period and the energy band structure, defined in standard crystals by the nature, can be controlled. Electron dynamics in a single superlattice miniband is interesting both from the viewpoint of fundamental and applied physics. From the fundamental perspective superlattices serve as a model system for a wealth of phenomena resulting from the wavenature of charge carriers. On the other hand, superlattices can potentially be utilized in oscillators and amplifiers operating at THz frequencies. They can, in principle, provide a reasonable THz Bloch gain under dc bias and parametric amplification in the presence of <b>ac</b> <b>pump</b> field. Because of numerous scientific and technological applications in different areas of science and technology, including astrophysics and atmospheric science, biological and medical sciences, and detection of concealed weapons and biosecurity, a construction of compact tunable THz amplifiers and generators that can operate at room temperature is an important – but so far unrealized – task. This thesis focuses on the influence of electric and magnetic fields on small-signal absorption and gain in semiconductor superlattices in the presence of dissipation (scattering). We present several new ideas how the effects arising due to the wave nature of the electrons can be utilized in an operation of THz oscillators and amplifiers. In Papers I–V, we discuss the properties of superlattice sub-THz and THz parametric amplifiers, whereas the Papers VI–IX are devoted to the problem of domain instability in the realization of cw THz Bloch oscillator. In Paper IX we also establish a feasibility of new type of superlattice THz amplifier based on nonlinear cyclotron-like oscillations of the miniband electrons. The ideas presented in the Papers I–IX are supplemented here with a detailed discussion of the physical origin of the effects and more rigorous mathematical derivations of the main equations...|$|E
40|$|An optical {{wireless}} transmission technique represents an attractive choice for many indoor and outdoors applications within fixed and mobile networks. It {{has the advantage}} of providing a wide bandwidth that is unregulated worldwide, with availability to use it in a very dense fashion, and potentially very low cost. Due to the high attenuation suffered by Infrared radiation through the air, operating low power transmission sources, and generally adverse signal to the noise environment found by ambient background light, where the optical signal is typically at it is minimum power level when detected. A high sensitivity and high selectivity receiver will be imperative for such applications as subcarrier multiplex systems, millimetre-wave radio over fibre and other wireless optical system applications. The thesis details the research, design, and optimisation of a novel, low-noise frontend optical receiver concept using a photoparametric amplifier (PPA) technique, in which the detected optical baseband signal is electrically amplified and up-converted to upperside frequency, based on the nonlinear characteristic of the pin photodiode junction; the desired signal passes through a further signal processing stage, and the original baseband signal is recovered again, using the concept of the superheterodyne principle. The designed DCHPPA receiver acts in a parallel manner to a conventional double superheterodyne detector system, but without the noise penalty normally incurred in the first stage. The PPA is used instead of a resistive/transistor based mixer at the first stage. DCHPPAs have the properties to provide very high gain, with high selectivity, combined with a very low noise operation. The research is conducted from three aspects: theoretical analysis, modelling and simulation, and practical implementation and result analysis. The three approaches followed the same trend shown, and the results correspond closely with each other. Theoretically, a new non-degenerate PPA mode of operation is discussed, in which the applied dc bias to the pin photodetector is replaced by the applied <b>ac</b> <b>pump</b> signal. This is shown to be advantageous in terms of the desirable characteristics for PPA operation, leading to improved conversion efficiency and the potential for low noise operation. PPA was shown to behave more optimally with load resistance which was much lower than normally used in the common optical wireless receiver-amplifiers. A new PPA gain theory was derived and optimised accordance with the original gain theory, PPA input/output admittance power was analysed for optimum power transfer. More accurate DCHPPA circuit configurations were modelled and simulated using nonlinear simulator tools (AWR) which help to understand and optimise system performance, particularly device parameters and characteristics. The full DCHPPA system was implemented practically, and tested in VHF and UHF as a sequel to the simulation configuration, which subsequently exhibited a 34. 9 dB baseband signal over the modulated optical signal; by employing a chain gain DCHPPA cascaded configuration, 56. 3 dB baseband signal gain was achieved.

40|$|To have non-zero net flow in <b>AC</b> electroosmotic <b>pumps,</b> the electroosmosis (EO) {{has to be}} {{non-linear}} and asymmetric. This can {{be achieved}} due to ionic concentration polarization. This is known to occur close to micro-/nano-interfaces provided that the sizes of the nanopores are not too large compared to the Debye screening length. However, operation of the corresponding EO pumps can be quite sensitive to the solution concentration and, thus, unstable in practical applications. Concentration polarization of ion-exchange membranes is much more robust. However, the hydraulic permeability of the membrane is very low, which makes EO flows through them extremely small. This communication shows theoretically how this problem can be resolved via making scarce microscopic perforations in an ion-exchange membrane and putting it in series with an EO-active nano-porous medium. The problem of coupled flow, concentration and electrostatic-potential distributions is solved numerically by using finite-element methods. This analysis reveals that even quite scarce perforations of micron-scale diameters are sufficient to observe practically-interesting EO flows in the system. If the average distance between the perforations is smaller than {{the thickness of the}} EO-active layer, there is an effective homogenization of the electrolyte concentration and hydrostatic pressure in the lateral direction at some distance from the interface. The simulations show this distance to be somewhat lower than the half-distance between the perforations. On the other hand, when the surface fraction of perforations is sufficiently small (below a fraction of a percent) this “homogeneous” concentration is considerably reduced (or increased, depending on the current direction), which makes the EO strongly non-linear and asymmetric.
