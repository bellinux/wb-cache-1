500|$|Furtado has {{characterized}} [...] "Maneater" [...] as [...] "a 'couture pop' song", explaining {{that it is}} [...] "in your face and very fashionable, stylistic and of-the-moment." [...] In an interview with MTV News, she compared it favorably to eating too much cheesecake: [...] "It's got a crazy loud beat, and the vocals are bitchy and loud. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> it sounds like Peaches, because of the delivery, the spooky vocals." [...] According to Furtado, the song is related to how people become [...] "hot on themselves" [...] when dancing in their underwear {{in front of a}} mirror.

500|$|Lauren London as New New/Erin Garnett, Rashad's love {{interest}} and John Garnett's daughter. The character of New-New was {{loosely based on}} R group TLC's [...] "T-Boz as a kid," [...] said London. [...] "I talked to her about my character... she explained to me how it was when she was young— the attitude and the flavor. And it’s funny, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> that I act like she used to act at the skating rink.” Director Robinson was impressed by London and [...] "everything from her look, {{to the fact that}} she's new.

500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} that accused the character's bodies of being lifeless, despite the game's use of motion capture, Brendan McNamara, the game's director and writer, stated {{in an interview}} with Eurogamer, [...] "People were saying people were dead from the neck down. That's because we had all this animation in the neck and all this animation in the face, but the clothes don't move. Once you get to the level that people can actually see that level of realism, then people expect to see clothes moving {{and the rest of the}} body moving in a way we can't replicate in video games." [...] In the same interview McNamara also responded to queries about why Phelps sometimes responds with particularly aggressive lines of dialogue during interrogation scenes. [...] "It's funny. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> Aaron turns into a psycho. When we originally wrote the game the questions you asked were coax, force and lie. It was actually force because it was a more aggressive answer. That's the way we recorded it. But when the game came out it was truth, doubt or lie. Everyone always says Aaron on the second question is a psycho. So that's not his fault." ...|$|E

In fact, Blacky the Crow does a whole lot of good in his own {{peculiar}} way, but people are always looking for him to do bad things, and you know you most always see what you expect to see. Thus the good Blacky does isn't seen, while the bad is, and so he has grown to have a reputation blacker than the coat he wears.|$|E

There's some in 'I Can't Live with You'; it's very personal, but I tried not to make it autobiographical because that narrows things too much.
