5|$|As Article 39A of the Constitution states, the GRC scheme entrenches the {{presence}} of minority MPs in Parliament, ensuring that interests of minority communities are represented in Parliament. Article 39A(1)(a) of the Constitution allows for a maximum number of six MPs for each GRC so as to provide flexibility in ensuring that a GRC with a rapidly expanding population is properly managed. As the population of a constituency grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for an MP to singlehandedly represent all his or her constituents' views. A team of MPs arguably has greater <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> constituents, {{and the fact that}} there are different MPs in the team suggests they can more effectively provide representation in Parliament of a wide range of constituents' views.|$|E
5|$|Before {{he worked}} for Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen in 1943, Bazna was hired to do some {{household}} and vehicle repairs for Douglas Busk, the first secretary of the British Embassy. Due to Bazna's poor English, he answered all interview questions in French. Although he supplied some written biographical information, excluding having been employed and fired by Albert Jenke, none of the biographical information was checked. Turkish secret service apparently warned the embassy at some point about Bazna. Over the few months that Bazna worked for Busk, he secretly photographed a few documents and, {{with the help of}} Mrs. Busk's nursemaid named Mara, he tried to gain <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> valuable forms of intelligence.|$|E

5|$|Dorset {{is served}} by 14 {{commercial}} bus operators. The Wilts & Dorset bus company has a county wide network with frequent services linking major towns and a limited service in rural locations. The First Group operate buses in the Weymouth and Bridport area, including: a regular route along the A35 from Weymouth to Axminster, which helps {{to compensate for the}} missing rail link west of Dorchester; and the Jurassic Coast service, one of the longest bus routes in the UK, which provides through travel from Poole to Exeter, exploiting a popular tourist route. Yellow Buses are the main providers of routes within the South East Dorset Conurbation. Damory Coaches is {{one of a number of}} operators that provide <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> rural communities.|$|E
5|$|Q*bert Rebooted {{contains}} a port {{of the classic}} arcade game alongside a new playing mode that uses hexagonal shapes, {{increasing the number of}} possible movement directions to six. Additionally, the 'Rebooted' mode features new enemy types, including a boxing glove that punches Q*bert off the levels and a treasure chest that tries to avoid him. The game has 5 different stage designs spread across 40 levels, which contain three rounds and a bonus round and have to be completed with 5 lives. Gems are collected to unlock different skins for the Q*bert character, and completing levels multiple times while reaching specific time and score goals is awarded with stars that enable <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> levels.|$|E

The Malkavians have separate dialog options, reflecting their inherent insanity. Upgrading some skills provides additional dialog options; attractive and charismatic characters seduce to get their way, aggressive characters threaten, and others persuade their targets to cooperate.|$|E
5|$|Æthelwulf's first Rochester coinage {{may have}} begun {{when he was still}} sub-king of Kent, under Egbert. A hoard of coins {{deposited}} at the beginning of Æthelwulf's reign in about 840, found in the Middle Temple in London, contained 22 coins from Rochester and two from Canterbury of the first issue of each mint. Some numismatists argue that the high proportion of Rochester coins means that the issue must have commenced before Egbert's death, but an alternative explanation is that whoever hoarded the coins simply happened to have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> Rochester coins. No coins were issued by Æthelwulf's sons during his reign.|$|E
5|$|Bánáthy later {{traded for}} milk to give two-year-old Béla and one-year-old László enough protein. As {{extremely}} little food {{was available in}} the camps, in early 1947 his wife's twin sister came from Hungary to take their older two sons back {{to live with the}} older sister. The Pallendal family, Bánáthy's in-laws, was well-educated and relatively wealthy, so they had <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> food than what was available in the camps. They intended to return the Banathy boys to their parents within a year. Beginning in early 1948, when the Cold War ensued, it became virtually impossible for refugees or displaced persons to cross from the border of one country into another, or even from one Occupation Zone to another. The Pallendal family could not return the two boys from behind the Iron Curtain.|$|E

5|$|The Florida State University Libraries {{house one}} of the largest {{collections}} of documents in the state of Florida. The Libraries' collections include over 3.2 million volumes, with a website offering <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> than 1,064 databases, 119,385 e-journals, and over 1.1 million e-books. In total, Florida State has thirteen libraries and millions of books and journals to choose from. The collection covers virtually all disciplines and includes a wide array of formats – from books and journals to manuscripts, maps, and recorded music. Increasingly collections are digital and are accessible on the Internet via the library web page or the library catalog. The FSU Library System also maintains subscriptions to a vast number of online databases which can be accessed from any student account on or off campus. The current dean of the Library System is Julia Zimmerman, who oversees a staff of over 268 employees and a $17.5million annual budget recorded in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The act of premastication is {{commonly}} found in all human societies and populations, although it is less prevalent in some than others. The evolution and selective advantage of premastication behaviours is that it supplements the infant diet of breast milk by providing <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> macro- and micro-nutrients. Although disease can be transmitted through saliva in the pre-chewed foods, the benefits conferred outweighed any risks of the practice during the evolution of human behaviour. Furthermore, discouraging premastication as prevention to disease transmittion may prove as disastrous an infant public health policy as when infants breastfeeding was discouraged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the end, the potential benefits and pitfalls of this practice greatly depend on the dietary and medical circumstances of the mother and child. The true scope {{of the benefits of}} premastication and its prevalences in differenct societies is still under active research, though there appears to be some consensus on the nutritional benefits of the practice.|$|E
5|$|What was {{ultimately}} {{included in the}} constitution was a modified form of this plan. In the Grand Committee, Benjamin Franklin successfully proposed the requirement that revenue bills originate in the house. But the final July 16 vote on the compromise still left the Senate looking like the Confederation Congress. In the preceding weeks of debate, Madison, King, and Gouverneur Morris each vigorously opposed the compromise for this reason. Then on July 23, just before most of the convention's work was referred to the Committee of Detail, Morris and King moved that state representatives in the Senate be given individual votes, rather than voting en bloc, as {{they had in the}} Confederation Congress. Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut, a leading proponent of the compromise, supported their motion, and the Convention adopted it. As the personally powerful senators were to receive terms much longer than the state legislators who appointed them, they became substantially independent. The compromise nonetheless continued to serve the self-interest of small-state political leaders, who were assured of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> seats in the Senate than they might otherwise have obtained.|$|E

5|$|While a grind, lip, or manual {{trick is}} underway, a balance meter appears: unless the player {{prevents}} this meter from {{falling to the}} left or right, the character will bail and need a few seconds to recover. Bailing can also be caused by falling without one's board facing downward. Completing tricks in succession without bailing is called a combo. Comboing raises the player's score and fills up the Special Meter; when it is full, the player is granted <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> elaborate tricks worth more points, such as the McTwist and 540 Flip. Underground introduces the ability to dismount one's skateboard, which allows the player to explore levels more carefully and reach new areas. Each level features at least one vehicle, usually a car, that the player can drive.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario 64 {{is set in}} Princess Peach's Castle, which {{consists}} of three floors, a basement, a moat, and a courtyard. The area outside the castle is an introductory {{area in which the}} player can experiment, testing his or her player skills. Scattered throughout the castle are entrances to courses via secret walls and paintings. Super Mario 64 begins with a letter from Princess Peach inviting Mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him. However, when he arrives, Mario discovers that Bowser has invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess and her servants within it using the power of the castle's 120 Power Stars. Many of the castle's paintings are portals to other worlds, in which Bowser's minions keep watch over the stars. Mario explores the castle for these portals to enter the worlds and recover the stars. He gains <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> rooms as he recovers more Power Stars, and eventually traverses three different obstacle courses, each leading to its own battle with Bowser. Defeating Bowser the first two times earns Mario a key for opening another level of the castle. After Mario defeats Bowser in the final battle, Peach is released from the stained-glass window above the castle's entrance. Peach rewards Mario by kissing him on the nose and baking the cake that she had promised him.|$|E
5|$|The battle system, {{called the}} Style-Change Active Time Battle system, uses {{elements}} from the Active Time Battle (ATB)-based Paradigm {{system from the}} first and second XIII games and bears similarities to the dressphere system featured in Final Fantasy X-2. Lightning has access to several customizable outfits (garb) with different power sets (plural: Schemata; singular: Schema). Each garb has its own separate ATB gauge, and actions for them are mapped onto the controller's face buttons, meaning that the usual menu-style ATB battle system is no longer needed: this enables Lightning to be moved around the battle field to a limited degree. The majority of the garbs and their accessories are either purchasable in the in-game shops or received upon completing quests. Stronger garbs, items, shields and weapons are unlocked in Hard Mode, along with <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> challenging areas and boss battles. Lightning can equip three Schemata directly, while having additional slots for backup costumes which can be equipped outside battle. She can be equipped with a close-combat weapon (sword, spear, etc.), a shield and a cosmetic accessory. The color scheme of each garb can be customized using both pre-set and custom color: there are options to alter both specific portions and all portions of the costume.|$|E
