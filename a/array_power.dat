50|$|The AN/SPY-3 {{consists}} of three active arrays and the Receiver/Exciter (REX) cabinets abovedecks and the Signal and Data Processor (SDP) subsystem below-decks. The VSR has a similar architecture, with the beamforming and narrowband down-conversion functionality occurring in two additional cabinets per array. A central controller (the resource manager) resides in the Data Processor (DP). The DBR is the first radar system that uses a central controller and two active-array radars operating at different frequencies. The DBR gets its power from the Common <b>Array</b> <b>Power</b> System (CAPS), which comprises Power Conversion Units (PCUs) and Power Distribution Units (PDUs). The DBR is cooled via a closed-loop cooling system called the Common Array Cooling System (CACS).|$|E

50|$|The {{spacecraft}} are cylindrical (2.9 x 1.3 m, see online 3D model) and are spinning at 15 rotations per minute. After launch, their {{solar cells}} provided 224 watts power for instruments and communications. Solar <b>array</b> <b>power</b> has gradually declined as the mission progressed, due to damage by energetic charged particles, {{but this was}} planned for and the power level remains sufficient for science operations. The four spacecraft maneuver into various tetrahedral formations to study the magnetospheric structure and boundaries. The inter-spacecraft distances can be altered and has varied from around 4 to 10,000 km.

50|$|The {{original}} SolarMagic {{device was}} a proprietary brand of power optimizer, a device which isolates the output from each PV-module {{from the rest}} of the system, preventing loss of performance by a single module from effecting the rest of the array. Because of the electronic characteristics of solar arrays, real-world conditions such as partial/temporary shading and irregular panel performance can lead to disproportionate and excessive losses of power output from the system. In one study, shading over a day of between 8% and 16% of the PV system surface area led to relative <b>array</b> <b>power</b> losses of between 35% and 40%. Despite National Semiconductor advertisement claims that their power optimizer could recoup up to 57% of the power lost as a result of these phenomena, real-world results typically ranged between 1% and 6% of overall system output improvement.|$|E
