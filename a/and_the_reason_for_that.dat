Telling a story isn't always a linear thing that involves going from point A to point B -- it's about putting myself back in a mind state to when I was struggling and when I had to really go out of my way to make ends meet when I was coming out of high school and really struggling.

40|$|Overconfidence {{has been}} {{identified}} as a source of suboptimal decision making in many real- life domains, and it often has far-reaching consequences. Here, we demonstrate a causal mechanism that leads to overconfidence and show a simple, effective remedy for it in an incentive-compatible experimental study. We show that joy induces overconfidence if the reason for joy (an unexpected gift) is unrelated to the judgment task and if participants were not made specifically aware of our mood manipulation. In contrast, we observed well- calibrated judgments among participants in a control group who were in their resting mood. Furthermore, we found well-calibrated judgments among participants who received the joyful mood induction together with questions that forced them to reflect on their current mood, its cause, and the (ir) relevance of its cause to our judgment tasks. Our findings suggest that being aware of one’s positive mood <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> mood can be an effective short- term remedy for overconfidence...|$|E

40|$|The use of biofuel {{has been}} {{increasing}} in Europe over the last years, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> is acceptable cost and the least {{negative impact on the}} environment. However, NOx and emissions of fine particulates are important, and biofuel is still a disadvantage compared to oil and natural gas fired systems. Usually, flue gas is filtered in multicyclones or fibre filters before discharge into the atmosphere. Yet, in the case of fine particulates, the filters of such type do not show high effectiveness, thus electrostatic precipitators are used. In this comparative study on biofuel (wood pellets), the collection efficiency of solid particles from a class 3 boiler (50 kW) and from a gasification unit (100 kW) was investigated. Although releases of solid particles from modern boilers are low, a combination of such a boiler with an electrostatic precipitator may reduce the releases of particles to the minimum, and the collection efficiency of the electrostatic precipitator obtained during the investigation was ~ 98 - 99 %. There is a big difference in particle concentrations comparing the systems with flue gas and producer gas. As the working conditions in the test section with producer gas were harder, it led to lower efficiency of the electrostatic precipitator (~ 75 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Fig. 6 The {{limit curve}} for the maximum {{velocity}} {{occurring in the}} diagonal space between the tubes for staggered tube banks Puchir based his criticism primarily on the assertion that the velocities given in my paper should be measured near the tube so that higher values would result than the average. This {{would lead to the}} false consideration of my paper according to his inter-pretation. As a matter of fact I must stress here that the veloci-ties for the minimum gap between two neighboring tubes of one row given in my paper are average values, calculated from the measurement far downstream in the section free of tubes. Thus, a further foundation of his criticism proved to be untrue. The final argument of Puchir is based on his assessment that the curious variation of Strouhal numbers for staggered tubes given in my paper should result from a shift of the point of maxi-mum velocity from the lateral space between tubes to the di-agonal space between tubes. He seems to explain tha t the quoted curious variation does not suit his concept <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> should lie in the choice of the parameter for the maxi-mum velocity in the Strouhal number.

Why do {{teenagers}} {{stop playing}} ice hockey? – A quantitative survey study about continued or ending ice hockey career after tryout to Team Västerbotten) Bachelor Essay in Swedish. Umeå: Umeå University, Department of education. Abstract This Bachelors thesis is a survey study on why talented teenagers {{in the county}} of Västerbotten, Sweden dropout of, or proceed the sport ice hockey. The study was made {{in collaboration with the}} ice hockey association of Västerbotten to find out how many of the boys born in 1993 and 1995 that has been on tryout for team Västerbotten that quits and continues <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> A survey was sent out to 138 of the teenagers that had been on these tryouts to examine the reasons and opinions on dropouts and what action that needs to be made to prevent this. The response rate was 57 % and a possible reason for that can be that they who didn’t respond are dropouts. It turned out that most of the respondents is still playing ice hockey, just a few had dropped out and the biggest reason is the fact that ice hockey is fun no matter if they made the team or not. Furthermore the study showed that the there isn’t just one reason to quit or continue, it’ a mix of reasons. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between culture and nationality {{and in that}} sense - national identity of a particular community - is a known thing for a long time. Nationality is usually strongly connected to culture. We will only mention few of their joint characteristics: language, religion, art, customs, tradition etc. In this article special attention will be paid to one of the features of national identity - language - and we will focus on the usage of Cyrillic alphabet of our target group (students of University of Priština, with temporary head office in Kosovska Mitrovica). The study consists of two smaller researches. In the first part we explored reactions of students at University of Priština and we assumed that they will have different reactions towards Cyrillic alphabet and Latin alphabet used as stimuli-words comparing to pupils of Belgrade and Zrenjanin high schools and students of University of Belgrade, Novi Sad and Niš presented in The associative dictionary of Serbian language (Asocjativni rečnik srpskog jezika, 2005). In the second part we tried to find out if our informants prefer the usage of Cyrillic or Latin alphabet, and which one they find better in the esthetic sense. We compared attitudes of students who enroll University of Priština to attitudes of students who enroll University of Belgrade and differences between their attitudes. With both researches we wanted {{to see if there are}} formed verbal stereotypes with positive or negative connotation, and what are the attitudes on using Cyrillic alphabet among students in the age of expansion of Latin alphabet. We concluded that Cyrillic alphabet is more used and valued at University of Priština than in the rest of Republic of Serbia <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> might be the stronger sense of national identity among these students...|$|E

A good example of such organization is Malmö University, where EFS can help in identifying the shortages of expertise in a specific field of study. Therefore, we have made a case study about the expert finding system at Malmö University, where we have made interviews and discussed the expert finding search process. Then we explored the role of ontologies and how the Semantic Web (SW) technologies can be utilized to search for meaning, rather than keywords, {{to improve the quality of}} the query results for expert finding, and thus minimizing unwanted search results. Furthermore, we study the several types of commonly used ontology design patterns (ODPs), which are predefined models to solve recurrent problems in designing ontologies, and then we suggest a suitable ODP to be used in designing an expert finding ontology (EFO) in a university setting.
