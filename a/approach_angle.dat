25|$|Drawing dies are {{typically}} made of tool steel, tungsten carbide, or diamond, with tungsten carbide and manufactured diamond {{being the most}} common. For drawing very fine wire a single crystal diamond die is used. For hot drawing, cast-steel dies are used. For steel wire drawing, a tungsten carbide die is used. The dies are placed in a steel casing, which backs the die and allow for easy die changes. Die angles usually range from 6–15°, and each die has at least 2 different angles: the entering angle and <b>approach</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractAs a {{preliminary}} study for estimating the measurement uncertainty and optimal design of bi-directional velocity probe used in fire testing application, {{the present study}} has been conducted to {{examine the effect of}} Reynolds number and flow <b>approaching</b> <b>angle</b> on the measurement uncertainty of bi-directional probe. Additionally, the CFD calculation has been performed to investigate the low field near the bi-directional probe and analyze the flow c aracteristics with the flow approaching an le. The experimental result shows that the measured probe constant for high Reynolds number is slightly higher than that of McCaffrey and Heskestad while it is in good accordance with Sette's previous result. For the case of Re= 3, 400, the angular sensitivity between - 45 ° and 45 ° well matched the previous work of McCaffrey and Heskestad and the maximum angular sensitivity reached 10 % comparing to t e case of the flow <b>approaching</b> <b>angle</b> of 0 °. The angular sensitivity increased with increasing Reynolds number and the maximum angular sensitivity was observed at flow <b>approaching</b> <b>angle</b> of 30 °. From the CFD analysis, asymmetric wake flow was observed at the rear side of bi-directional probe at flow <b>approaching</b> <b>angle</b> of 30 °, and the dynamics pressure variation inside the probe hole may affect the angular sensitivity of velocity measurement using bi-directional probe. The present study focuses on the measurement uncertainty and design optimization of bi- directional probe and can contribute to improving the reliability of fire measurement...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a flight test program to determine the effects on landings of wide variations in <b>approach</b> path <b>angle</b> and <b>approach</b> airspeed for different kinds of piloting technique. Over 400 landings were made at approach speeds from 60 to 120 mph and <b>approach</b> path <b>angles</b> from 3 to 18 deg. Several variations of pilot technique involving different operations of the throttle/spoiler control were investigated. It is shown that very large ranges of airspeed and <b>approach</b> path <b>angle</b> can be accommodated with rather moderate penalties in landing distance and difficulty. With the spoiler-equipped aircraft, the best approach speeds are considerably higher than would be usable without spoilers, and <b>approach</b> path <b>angles</b> can be used which are far beyond those normally possible without spoilers...|$|R

The 2014 Trail Teams Ultimate Edition FJ Cruiser comes in a Heritage Blue paint scheme (resembling an original FJ40 Land Cruiser factory paint color), and for the first time features a white grille bezel that again pays tribute to the iconic Land Cruiser FJ40. The remaining vehicle trim remains black, similar to previous versions of the Trail Teams Special Edition. [...] While all of the Trail Teams FJ Cruisers feature a race-inspired TRD/Trail Teams off-road suspension designed by Bilstein, the Ultimate Edition features a new rear remote reservoir suspension. The suspension also raises the vehicle slightly taller than stock as to achieve a leveled stance. The Ultimate Edition is also equipped with a special 1/4 inch thick aluminum TRD skid plate, designed to help with the <b>approach</b> <b>angle</b> for the front of the vehicle and provide better protection while off-roading. Significant interior differences that are unique to the 2014 Trails Team Ultimate Edition include; the interior panel inserts are black rather than color matched to the exterior color of the vehicle, the radio bezel is silver, and a special [...] "Ultimate Edition" [...] dash plaque is affixed to the dash on the passenger side indicating the special edition is only [...] "One of 2500." [...] Additionally, the seating fabric inserts are color matched to coordinate with the Ultimate Edition's unique silver/black interior, rather than the exterior color as in previous years.|$|E

40|$|A flight {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} effect of a fully controllable thrust reverser on the flight characteristics of a single-engine jet airplane. Tests were made using a cylindrical target-type reverser actuated by a hydraulic cylinder through a "beep-type" cockpit control mounted {{at the base of the}} throttle. The thrust reverser was evaluated as an in-flight decelerating device, as a flight path control and airspeed control in landing approach, and as a braking device during the ground roll. Full deflection of the reverser for one reverser configuration resulted in a reverse thrust ratio of as much as 85 percent, which at maximum engine power corresponded to a reversed thrust of 5100 pounds. Use of the reverser in landing approach made possible a wide selection of <b>approach</b> <b>angles,</b> a large reduction in approach speed at steep <b>approach</b> <b>angles,</b> improved control of flight path angle, and more accuracy in hitting a given touchdown point. The use of the reverser as a speed brake at lower airspeeds was compromised by a longitudinal trim change. At the lower airspeeds and higher engine powers there was insufficient elevator power to overcome the nose-down trim change at full reverser deflection...|$|R
