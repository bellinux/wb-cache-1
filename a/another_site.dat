Modern digs in Tahiti and the other Society Islands have uncovered few surviving remains of the Tahitian Dog. In 1960, a few canine teeth were uncovered at Ana Paia shelter, on Mo'orea. In 1962, a complete skull, limbs, and vertebrae were discovered at a marae site on Mo'orea along with a jawbone at <b>another</b> <b>site</b> on the same island.|$|E

5|$|After {{the deal}} in Marysville fell through, ISC courted <b>another</b> <b>site,</b> this time south of Bremerton National Airport in Bremerton, WA just across Puget Sound from Seattle. Although like the Marysville {{proposal}} the proposal in Bremerton {{was to be}} partially funded with public money, the money will not come directly from taxes but instead from bonds funded by taxes, in a scheme {{similar to the one}} used to fund Kansas Speedway. Also like the Marysville proposal, the Bremerton track would be publicly owned and leased to ISC for three races per year. ISC's current proposal was met with a lukewarm response from area lawmakers and citizens, but the company has promised to present an improved offer for early 2007.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} details are unknown, in April738 K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat {{captured}} Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil and burned two of Copán's patron deities. Six days later Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was decapitated in Quiriguá. This coup {{does not seem}} to have physically affected either Copán or Quiriguá; there is no evidence that either city was attacked at this time and the victor seems not to have received any detectable tribute. All of this seems to imply that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat managed to somehow ambush Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, rather than to have defeated him in outright battle. It has been suggested that Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was attempting to attack <b>another</b> <b>site</b> to secure captives for sacrifice in order to dedicate the new ballcourt when he was ambushed by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat and his Quiriguá warriors.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} finds in the Taynton Limestone Formation, in 1939 Sidney Hugh Reynolds {{referred}} remains to Megalosaurus {{that had been}} found in the older Chipping Norton Limestone Formation dating from the early Bathonian, about thirty single teeth and bones. Though the age disparity makes it problematic to assume an identity with Megalosaurus bucklandii, in 2009 Benson could not establish any relevant anatomical differences with M. bucklandii among the remains found at one site, the New Park Quarry, and therefore affirmed the reference to that species. However, in <b>another</b> <b>site,</b> the Oakham Quarry, the material contained one bone, an ilium, that was clearly dissimilar.|$|E

5|$|Archæological {{evidence}} from the Birrigai rock shelter in Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve indicates habitation dating back at least 21,000 years. It {{is possible that the}} area was inhabited for considerably longer, with evidence of an Aboriginal presence in south-western New South Wales dating back around 40,000–62,000 years. <b>Another</b> <b>site</b> of significance in the reserve is the Bogong Rocks shelter, which contains the oldest evidence of Aboriginal occupation at a bogong moth resting site. These insects were an important source of food for the Aboriginal peoples of the Southern Alps and would accumulate by the thousands in caves and rock crevices, where they were collected and later roasted in sand or ashes, and then eaten whole.|$|E
5|$|During {{the field}} season of 1987 (early July), {{volunteer}} Sidney M. Hostetter located another horned dinosaur skull near the Canyon Bone Bed, specimen MOR 485. By {{the end of}} August, it had been secured and was driven on a grain truck to the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman. On 23 June 1988, <b>another</b> <b>site</b> was discovered in the vicinity – the Blacktail Creek North. In the summer of 1989, graduate student Scott D. Sampson joined the team, wanting to study {{the function of the}} frill display structures in horned dinosaurs. At the end of June 1989, Horner, his son Jason and his head preparator Carrie Ancell discovered horned dinosaur specimen MOR 591 near the Blacktail Creek.|$|E
5|$|In August 1999, the {{architect}} informed the project group that the Parliament {{would need to}} be further increased in size by 4,000squaremetres (43,000sqft). A subsequent costing revealed that taking into account the increased floorspace net construction costs had risen to £115m by September 1999. Early in 2000, the SPCB commissioned an independent report by {{the architect}} John Spencely. The report concluded that savings of 20% could be made on the current project and that scrapping the project completely at that stage or moving to <b>another</b> <b>site</b> would entail additional costs of £30m. Spencely also cited poor communication between the SPCB and construction officials as increasingly costly. Given the outcomes of the Spencely report, MSPs voted to continue with the construction project on the Holyrood site in a debate in the Scottish Parliament on 5 April 2000.|$|E

Construction was due to start during spring 2015, for a completion date of July 2016. York City were given responsibility for operating and managing the stadium on an initial 13-year contract. A planning application for the GLL plan was submitted to the council in December 2014, which was passed in March 2015. The cost of the stadium and leisure complex, including a replacement athletics track at <b>another</b> <b>site,</b> stood at £37million.|$|E
5|$|The McClintock {{expedition}} {{also found}} a human skeleton on the southern coast of King William Island. Still clothed, it was searched, and some papers were found, including a seaman's certificate for Chief Petty Officer Henry Peglar (b. 1808), Captain of the Foretop, HMS Terror. However, since the uniform {{was that of a}} ship's steward, {{it is more likely that}} the body was that of Thomas Armitage, gun-room steward on Terror and a shipmate of Peglar, whose papers he carried. At <b>another</b> <b>site</b> on the western extreme of the island, Hobson discovered a lifeboat containing two skeletons and relics from the Franklin expedition. In the boat was a large amount of abandoned equipment, including boots, silk handkerchiefs, scented soap, sponges, slippers, hair combs, and many books, among them a copy of The Vicar of Wakefield. McClintock also took testimony from the Inuit about the expedition's disastrous end.|$|E
5|$|The {{worship of}} Shiva became popular in Central Asia through the Hephthalite Empire, and Kushan Empire. Shaivism was also popular in Sogdia and the Kingdom of Yutian as found {{from the wall}} {{painting}} from Penjikent on the river Zervashan. In this depiction, Shiva is portrayed with a sacred halo and a sacred thread ("Yajnopavita"). He is clad in tiger skin while his attendants are wearing Sogdian dress. A panel from Dandan Oilik shows Shiva in His Trimurti form with Shakti kneeling on her right thigh. <b>Another</b> <b>site</b> in the Taklamakan Desert depicts him with four legs, seated cross-legged on a cushioned seat supported by two bulls.

5|$|Work {{began on}} {{creating}} a landing ground at Folks Wood, Lympne, {{in the autumn}} of 1915. This site soon proved unsuitable and <b>another</b> <b>site</b> was sought. Lympne was established in March 1916 as an Emergency Landing Ground for the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) home defence fighters defending London against Zeppelins and Gothas. No.1 Advanced School of Air Gunnery operated from Lympne during January and February 1917. In January 1917 it was designated as No.8 Aircraft Acceptance Park for delivery of aircraft to, and reception from, France. On 25 May 1917 Lympne was bombed by Gotha G.IV bombers of Kagohl 3 who dropped 19 bombs on the airfield.|$|E
5|$|In 738 the {{interlinked}} {{fortunes of}} Quiriguá and Copán took a stunning change of direction when K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat, reigning lord of Quiriguá, captured the powerful, but elderly 13th king of Copán, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, who had installed {{him on his}} throne in 725. This coup {{does not seem to}} have affected either Copán or Quiriguá physically, there is no evidence that either city was attacked at this time and the victor seems not to have received any detectable tribute. Quiriguá seems rather to have gained its independence and the control of important trade routes. An inscription at Quiriguá, although difficult to interpret, suggests that the capture took place on 27 April 738, when Quiriguá seized and burned the wooden images of Copán's patron deities. All of this seems to imply that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat managed to somehow ambush Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, rather than to have defeated him in outright battle. In the Classic Period the statues of Maya deities often were carried into battle on palanquins, facilitating their capture in the event of defeat. It has been suggested that the king of Copán was attempting to attack <b>another</b> <b>site</b> in order to secure captives for sacrifice, and was ambushed by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat and his Quiriguá warriors.|$|E
5|$|The {{subject of}} a {{permanent}} capital for the United States was discussed numerous times during the years immediately following the Revolutionary War, however, the Continental Congress could never agree on a site due to regional loyalties and tensions. In September 1788, the Congress of the Confederation selected New York City as the nation's temporary capital under the incoming federal government. The framers of the Constitution granted the new U.S. Congress exclusive governing jurisdiction over a federal district, intentionally separate from not beholden to any state. The Constitution, however, said nothing about where it would be. Discussions during the 1st Congress about where to locate the permanent seat of government revolved around two locations: one site on the Potomac River near Georgetown; and <b>another</b> <b>site</b> on the Susquehanna River near Wrights Ferry (now Columbia, Pennsylvania). The Susquehanna River site {{was approved by the}} House in September 1789, while legislation under consideration in the Senate specified a site on the Delaware River near Germantown, Pennsylvania. No agreement was reached, and the subject was deferred until the second session.|$|E

5|$|The {{territory}} of the Maya covered a third of Mesoamerica, and the Maya {{were engaged in a}} dynamic relationship with neighbouring cultures that included the Olmecs, Mixtecs, Teotihuacan, the Aztecs, and others. During the Early Classic period, the Maya cities of Tikal and Kaminaljuyu were key Maya foci in a network that extended beyond the Maya area into the highlands of central Mexico. At around the same time, there was a strong Maya presence at the Tetitla compound of Teotihuacan. Centuries later, during the 9th century AD, murals at Cacaxtla, <b>another</b> <b>site</b> in the central Mexican highlands, were painted in a Maya style. This may have been either an effort to align itself with the still-powerful Maya area after the collapse of Teotihuacan and ensuing political fragmentation in the Mexican Highlands, or an attempt to express a distant Maya origin of the inhabitants. The Maya city of Chichen Itza and the distant Toltec capital of Tula had an especially close relationship.|$|E
