25|$|Schwartz has {{authored}} several books, {{most recently}} , a leading book on cutaneous oncology currently {{in its second}} edition. He has written or edited 10 monographs, {{and is the author}} of over 250 book chapters, 500 articles, and 200 other publications. Many of these are in the area of dermatologic oncology, where he has had a special interest in epidermal tumors, paraneoplastic syndromes, and Kaposi’s sarcoma. He has published more than 50 full articles on Kaposi’s sarcoma since 1978, including one of the first three reports of KS-AIDS in 1981. He was the first to describe many Kaposi's sarcoma morphologic variants. In 1978 he first described florid cutaneous papillomatosis. In 1981 he discovered and described acral <b>acanthosis</b> nigricans. In 1994 he devised the commonly-accepted classification for <b>acanthosis</b> nigricans.|$|E
25|$|In 1981 Schwartz led one of {{the three}} groups that first {{described}} AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma (KS-AIDS). In 1978 he first described florid cutaneous papillomatosis. Schwartz is credited with the clinical description of new subtypes of Kaposi's sarcoma: telangiectatic Kaposi's sarcoma, keloidal Kaposi's sarcoma and ecchymotic Kaposi’s sarcoma. In 1981 he first described acral acanthotic anomaly (acral <b>acanthosis</b> nigricans). In 1980 Edmund Klein, Schwartz and associates published in Cancer {{one of the}} first effective treatments of Kaposi’s sarcoma, a type of cancer that became more frequent as the AIDS epidemic unfolded.|$|E

2500|$|Other signs include {{increased}} urination (and accompanying increased thirst), persistent {{high blood}} pressure (due to cortisol's enhancement of epinephrine's vasoconstrictive effect) and insulin resistance (especially common with ACTH production outside the pituitary), leading to high blood sugar and insulin resistance {{which can lead to}} diabetes mellitus. [...] Insulin resistance is accompanied by skin changes such as <b>acanthosis</b> nigricans in the axilla and around the neck, as well as skin tags in the axilla. Untreated Cushing's syndrome can lead to heart disease and increased mortality. Cortisol can also exhibit mineralocorticoid activity in high concentrations, worsening the hypertension and leading to hypokalemia (common in ectopic ACTH secretion). Furthermore, excessive cortisol may lead to gastrointestinal disturbances, opportunistic infections, and impaired wound healing related to cortisol's suppression of the immune and inflammatory responses. Osteoporosis is also an issue in Cushing's syndrome since osteoblast activity is inhibited. Additionally, Cushing's syndrome may cause sore and aching joints, particularly in the hip, shoulders, and lower back. [...] Cushing’s syndrome includes all the causes of increased cortisol leading to the diseased state. [...] Cushing’s disease is a specific type of Cushing’s syndrome caused by a pituitary tumor leading to excessive production of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone). Excessive ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce high levels of cortisol, producing the disease state. Cushing's disease due to excess ACTH may also result in hyperpigmentation. This is due to Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone production as a byproduct of ACTH synthesis from Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). Alternatively, it is proposed that the high levels of ACTH, β-lipotropin, and γ-lipotropin, which contain weak MSH function, can act on the melanocortin 1 receptor. A variant of Cushing's disease can be caused by ectopic, i.e. extrapituitary, ACTH production from, for example, a small-cell lung cancer. When Cushing's syndrome is caused by an increase of cortisol {{at the level of the}} adrenal glands (via an adenoma or hyperplasia), negative feedback ultimately reduces ACTH production in the pituitary. In these cases, ACTH levels remain low and no hyperpigmentation develops. [...] While all Cushing’s disease gives Cushing’s syndrome, not all Cushing’s syndrome is due to Cushing’s disease.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternate}} {{classification system}} still {{used to describe}} <b>acanthosis</b> nigricans was proposed in 1994. It delineates <b>acanthosis</b> nigricans syndromes according to their associated syndromes, including benign and malignant forms, forms associated with obesity and drugs, acral <b>acanthosis</b> nigricans, unilateral <b>acanthosis</b> nigricans, and mixed and syndromic forms.|$|E
50|$|Malignant <b>acanthosis</b> nigricans {{refers to}} <b>acanthosis</b> nigricans {{occurring}} as a paraneoplastic syndrome {{associated with a}} cancer. Malignant <b>acanthosis</b> nigricans is most commonly associated with gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, as well as genitourinary cancers {{such as those of}} the prostate, breast, and ovary. Other cancers, such as those of the lung, stomach, and lymphoma, are occasionally associated with <b>acanthosis</b> nigricans.|$|E
50|$|This form of <b>acanthosis</b> nigricans is {{more likely}} to involve mucous {{membranes}} (25-50% of cases) Malignant <b>acanthosis</b> nigricans that may either precede (18%), accompany (60%), or follow (22%) the onset of an internal cancer.
