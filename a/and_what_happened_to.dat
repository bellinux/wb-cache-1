A building superintendent at the hotel, not on duty that night, had a vague memory of Solanas: [...] "Once, he had to enter her room, and he saw her typing at her desk.

In June 2008, Davis reiterated his hopes to return for a theatrically-released second installment of the film. On February 15, 2013 Val Kilmer posted a photo via Twitter implying that it was [...] "Right around the corner!". However, this coincided with a Life's Too Short mockumentary featuring Davis and Kilmer, {{and is likely to}} have been a hoax. In March 2013, Davis indicated an interest in seeing a sequel (perhaps as a TV series), but gave no indication that any development was ongoing. In September 2016, Warwick Davis went on record again in stating that he would not like to see a remake of Willow but {{he would like to see}} a sequel that explores if Willow became a sorcerer or not <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Elora Danan when she grew up.|$|E

[...] As Tywin repeatedly calls Tyrion's tragic first wife Tysha a [...] "whore," [...] Tyrion warns him to stop. Tywin has always taught his son that you must follow through on your threats if you are defied, so when he fails to heed Tyrion's warning, the dwarf kills him. [...] "And it will haunt him.

500|$|The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with an A-, {{explaining}} that {{though he did}} not want to give a full review until the season finale aired, he was [...] "enjoying how Fringe third season is wrapping up", such as [...] "the cross-cutting between Earth-1 and Earth-2, and the sense of imminent doom." [...] Murray continued that he [...] "especially liked... that in the midst of all this end-times rush, it pauses periodically to check in with the various characters in short one-on-one scenes, strengthening our sense of what these relationships mean. (It's something that Fringe has gotten good at in the past year-and-a-half, and something I wouldn't have predicted for the show back in season one.)" [...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, critic Andrew Hanson noted Fringe is preparing for the finale, calling [...] "6:02 AM EST" [...] a [...] "movement episode [...] give an opportunity to get everyone into place for the big climax" [...] in a vein similar to the television series Lost. Hanson enjoyed the two [...] "sleights of hand", explaining he was surprised by Fauxlivia's universe-crossing device failing <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Peter after touching the machine.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference.

[...] He said that he was [...] "glad" [...] to have taken part in the race and that the victory was special for him because his wife is from England. De Ferran earned US$100,000 (£68,600) for the victory. Bräck said that he had no complaint over the last-lap loss and that it was a [...] "tough" [...] and [...] "exciting" [...] race. He said the remaining four races of the season were [...] "crucial" [...] and that the [...] "very close" [...] battle for the championship was not over. He stated that he was looking forward to those events and hoped they would play into his favour. Castroneves congratulated de Ferran on securing the victory,saying that it was [...] "a quick and busy day" [...] for the people who were involved in the event. He was glad that the race was able to be held, and hoped to achieve a good result at the next race of the season.|$|E
500|$|An {{extended}} flashback reveals Finn's origin, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> {{the other}} humans. Roughly {{a thousand years}} prior to the main events of the series, a group of humansaided by Marcelinefled Ooo on a container ship (as seen in Stakes). They eventually settled on a secluded island chain far from the mainland. [...] Over the next thousand years, their community thrived and developed into an advanced technological society. While it was a veritable utopia, there were those few who occasionally grew dissatisfied with their rigidly structured lives and attempted to flee the island; these [...] "hiders" [...] were in turn hunted down and returned by specially trained [...] "seekers". It is revealed that Susan's real name is Kara, and that she was once a seeker in training. [...] Kara was friends with a fellow human, Frieda (voiced by Jasika Nicole), who began expressing a desire to flee the safe albeit authoritarian island. This revelation causes Kara some discomfort, so she approaches Dr. Gross (voiced by Lennon Parham), the cybernetic human in charge of training seekers, asking if the humans can live off the island. Dr. Gross convinces her that the outside is dangerous and, to prevent her from fleeing, she controls Kara with a remote control. Now fully under Dr. Gross's control, Kara stops Frieda from leaving and drags her away crying. Back in the present, Susan tells Finn her real name and decides to take Finn to Founders Island so that he can be reunited with his mother, Minerva Campbell (voiced by Sharon Horgan).|$|E

500|$|On 18 June 1999, Ackah {{anonymously}} telephoned Brent social services, expressing {{concern over}} Climbié's situation. Samantha Hunt, the customer-service officer {{who received the}} call at the One Stop Shop at Brent House, faxed the referral to the children's social work department on that same day. Nobody picked up the referral on that Friday afternoon, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> it was—according to Lord Laming, who headed the subsequent inquiry—the subject of [...] "some of the most bizarre and contradictory evidence" [...] the inquiry heard. A few days later, possibly on 21 June 1999, Ackah phoned Brent social services again to make sure her concerns were being addressed. Ackah {{said that she was}} told by the person {{on the other end of}} the telephone that [...] "probably they [...] had done something about it". This call, however, did not trigger a new, separate referral. The first referral was not seen until three weeks later on 6 July 1999, when Robert Smith, the group administrative officer, logged the details of the referral onto the computer, with details of Climbié's injuries. Laming said the delay constituted [...] "a significant missed opportunity" [...] to protect Climbié. Edward Armstrong, the team manager of the intake duty team, said that he completed a duty manager's action sheet not for the 18 June referral, which he said never arrived in his office, but for the 21 June referral, which was a less serious case than the first; Laming called this version of events [...] "wholly unbelievable". Laming said that Armstrong's evidence was out of line with that of the other Brent witnesses, that the quality of it [...] " [...] much to be desired", and that Armstrong's insistence that he dealt with the 21 June referral was an attempt to cover up his team's [...] "inept handling" [...] of a genuine child protection case.|$|E

2500|$|Issue #31 (May 1979) {{announced}} on its letters page {{that it would}} be the final issue of Howard the Duck as a color comic. Marvel then relaunched the series that year as a bimonthly magazine, with scripts by Mantlo, art by Colan and Michael Golden and unrelated backup features by others; this series was canceled after nine issues. [...] Articles in these issues claimed that Howard was Mayerik's idea, though this is contrary to statements by both Gerber and Mayerik. In issue #6, Mantlo introduced the concept of [...] "Duckworld", which Gerber loathed. [...] It depicted an all-duck parallel earth in which there were equivalents of all famous people, such as [...] "Ducktor Strange" [...] (a parody of Doctor Strange) who later appeared in The Sensational She-Hulk (#19) and Truman Capoultry (Truman Capote), who narrated the issue. [...] As Gerber told Mediascene: [...] "Howard's world, which would never be depicted visually, was inhabited by other anthropomorphized animals like himself. Like the cartoon worlds of Disney and Warner Brothers. Unlike the Disney and Warners worlds, however, Howard's reality was beset with the same plethora of social ills and personal vicissitudes which human beings confront daily. And the same, or similar, laws of nature applied there, too." [...] The first story of issue #9, written by Bill Mantlo, had Howard walk away from Beverly Switzler, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him next was documented in a story by Steve Skeates the same issue. [...] Steven Grant followed this with a story in Bizarre Adventures #34, in which the suicidal Howard is put through a parody of It's a Wonderful Life.|$|E
