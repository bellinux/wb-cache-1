5|$|As {{a result}} of the cyclone's slow movement, heavy rains {{impacted}} the same area for more than a week, resulting in severe flooding. Throughout Mangaia, nearly 90% of the islands' staple crop was lost and about 60% of the livestock perished. Following an <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> damage, it was determined that US$52,000 was needed to repair losses. Due to the severity of damage caused by Trina, its name was retired in May 2002 and replaced with Tino.|$|E
5|$|As {{the town}} became more prominent, it was {{repeatedly}} {{attacked by the}} Hanseatic League. As the fishing industry thrived in Copenhagen, particularly in the trade of herring, the city began expanding {{to the north of}} Slotsholmen. In 1254, it received a charter as a city under Bishop Jakob Erlandsen who garnered support from the local fishing merchants against the king by granting them special privileges. In the mid 1330s, the first land <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city was published.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{the outcome}} of the Holbrooke–Tuđman meeting and the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HV General Staff that the VRS 2nd Corps was {{completely}} destroyed, a decision was made to deploy the HV to the area with virtually no preparation and planning. The <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HV General Staff was based on ARBiH gains in western Bosnia and Herzegovina over the previous four days. The order to attack was drawn up on 17 September and signed by Major General Vinko Vrbanac on behalf of the Chief of the General Staff, General Zvonimir Červenko. The attack, codenamed Operation Una, was to commence with crossings of the Una River at Novi Grad and Bosanska Dubica, and the Sava River at Jasenovac, followed by the seizing of Mount Prosara to allow for further advances towards Prijedor. The operation was intended to be coordinated with the ARBiH 5th Corps, which would continue its rapid advance towards Prijedor and Novi Grad.|$|E
5|$|Denmark's Flexicurity model {{features}} {{some of the}} most flexible hiring and firing legislation in Europe, providing attractive conditions for foreign investment and international companies looking to locate in Copenhagen. In Dansk Industri's 2013 survey of employment factors in the ninety-six municipalities of Denmark, Copenhagen came in first place for educational qualifications and for the development of private companies in recent years, but fell to 86th place in local companies' <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> employment climate. The survey revealed considerable dissatisfaction in the level of dialogue companies enjoyed with the municipal authorities.|$|E
5|$|Further {{neurological}} examinations {{are crucial}} in {{the differential diagnosis}} of AD and other diseases.

Caregivers can supply important information on the daily living abilities, {{as well as on}} the decrease, over time, of the person's mental function. A caregiver's viewpoint is particularly important, since a person with AD is commonly unaware of his own deficits. Many times, families also have difficulties in the detection of initial dementia symptoms and may not communicate accurate information to a physician.|$|E

As of 2015, the castle is open to visitors through guided tours organised by the Rye Harbour Nature Reserve. The site is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building.|$|E

5|$|In March 2011 an <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greyfriars site {{began to}} {{identify}} where the monastery had stood, and which land {{might be available}} for excavation. A desk-based assessment was conducted to determine the archaeological viability of the site, followed by a survey in August 2011 using ground-penetrating radar (GPR). The GPR results were inconclusive; no clear building remains could be identified owing to a layer of disturbed ground and demolition debris just below the surface. The survey was useful in finding modern utilities crossing the site, such as pipes and cables.|$|E

5|$|No tornado watches or {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{before the storm}} struck.

Although a severe thunderstorm warning was issued at 2:57 pm, very few people received the warnings in time.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, {{a report}} {{on the quality of the}} walls around 1460 noted that on the north and east sides of Southampton, the walls were still too thin to block a cannon shot or for a man to stand on them; a wood and earth wall-walk had been built behind the walls, but this was proving very {{expensive}} to maintain. This contemporary <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weakness of the eastern walls has been confirmed by modern archaeological excavation – in places it was only 0.76 m (2.49 feet) thick, compared to a typical thickness in other English town walls of around 1 m (3.28 feet).|$|E
