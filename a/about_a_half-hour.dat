5|$|Friedman {{spent the}} 1954–1955 {{academic}} {{year as a}} Fulbright Visiting Fellow at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. At the time, the Cambridge economics faculty was divided into a Keynesian majority (including Joan Robinson and Richard Kahn) and an anti-Keynesian minority (headed by Dennis Robertson). Friedman speculated that {{he was invited to}} the fellowship, because his views were unacceptable to both of the Cambridge factions. Later his weekly columns for Newsweek magazine (1966–84) were well read and increasingly influential among political and business people.

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 22 July, she was {{flagship}} of Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt, commander of the Harwich Force, as he took Carysfort, her half-sister , and eight destroyers to sea to patrol the sea lanes between Felixstowe and the Dutch coast. He split his forces to cover the two routes involved and encountered three German torpedo boats en route to attack merchant shipping in that area around 01:15 of the following morning. Hampered by an inopportune rain squall and a German smoke screen, Tyrwhitt's ships were only able to engage the Germans {{for a short time}} before they disengaged. Tyrwhitt then ordered Canterbury and her escort to intercept the fleeing Germans; they spotted six torpedo boats <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>half-hour</b> later and opened fire at 02:02. Visibility was poor because of another smoke screen laid by the Germans and the British ships were forced to disengage without inflicting any damage at 02:25 as they were approaching a minefield.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate ironclad Tennessee {{attacked}} Farragut's wooden ships {{without much}} effect {{after they had}} passed the Confederate forts and she was engaged by Winnebago before she disengaged and briefly took shelter under Fort Morgan's guns. <b>About</b> <b>a</b> <b>half-hour</b> later, the ironclad attacked Farragut's ships again. The monitors were not initially engaged, but Chickasaw managed to assume a position by the Tennessees stern and fired repeatedly at point-blank range. Her shots failed to penetrate the Tennessees armor, but they did jam the armored shutter for the stern gun port and cut her exposed steering chains, rendering her unable to steer. When the crew attempted to unjam the shutter, one shell struck {{the edge of the}} shutter, creating fragments that killed the machinist attempting to knock out the shutter's retaining pin and broke Admiral Franklin Buchanan's leg. This damage, together with damage inflicted by the other Union ships, persuaded Commander James D. Johnston to surrender his ship. The two monitors remained in Mobile Bay and subsequently bombarded Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines until they surrendered less than three weeks later.|$|E

500|$|In October the {{advancing}} Third Army began to bombard the harbor with [...] siege howitzers, firing at random. They hit Poltava twice on 7 October, though the shells only started fires. On 5 December the Japanese captured 203 Meter Hill, a crucial position {{that overlooked the}} harbor and allowed them to direct their artillery at the Russian ships. Poltava was hit that same day by five shells, three of which penetrated the deck. One hit a torpedo room, and another burst in the aft 47mm magazine. That started a fire {{that could not be}} put out because the flooding system had been previously damaged and eventually ignited propellant charges in the adjacent 12-inch magazine. <b>About</b> <b>a</b> <b>half-hour</b> after the hit, the magazine exploded and blew a hole in the ship's bottom that caused her to sink 45 minutes later in the shallow water.|$|E
500|$|Almost a year later, {{the ship}} {{participated in the}} Battle of Jutland on 31 May–1 June 1916. The 2nd LCS {{screened}} the battlecruisers during the battle. Nottingham helped to repel an attack by German torpedo boats around 16:26 during {{the first phase of}} the battle, the [...] "Run to the South". After spotting the main German battlefleet at 16:30, the 2nd LCS followed the Beatty's ships in a turn to the north fifteen minutes later. During the turn and afterwards, they were fired upon by eleven German battleships at very long range without significant effect. Their late turn meant that they now trailed Beatty's battlecruisers and were now even with the battleships of the attached 5th Battle Squadron by about 18:50. About 10 minutes later, the 2nd LCS engaged the crippled light cruiser , but were forced to disengage by the German battleships and took up station at the rear of the Grand Fleet. <b>About</b> <b>a</b> <b>half-hour</b> later, they fired at the disabled torpedo boat [...]|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 18 August, the Grand Fleet put to sea in {{response}} to a message deciphered by Room 40 that indicated that the High Seas Fleet, minus II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard Sunderland the following day, based on extensive reconnaissance conducted by Zeppelins and submarines. Part of the German plan was to draw the British ships through a series of submarine ambushes and Nottingham fell victim to one of the awaiting U-boats, U-52, about 06:00 the following morning. The submarine was spotted <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>half-hour</b> prior despite the morning haze, but she was believed to be a small fishing boat and disregarded. U-52 initially hit the cruiser with two torpedoes that knocked out all power, but Nottingham was not in danger of sinking until she was hit with another torpedo 25 minutes later. Her half-sister [...] had reported the first attack; in response, Beatty dispatched two destroyers to render assistance and they arrived about 10 minutes before Nottingham sank at 07:10.

Davenport's personal impression of the Sultan was sympathetic, viewing him as a frail, elderly man burdened by the weight of his office but kind and fatherly to his children. Davenport compared his appearance as a melding of the late congressman from Maine, Nelson Dingley, with merchant and philanthropist Nathan Straus, commenting of the Sultan, [...] "I thought... that no matter what crimes had been charged to him, his expressionless soldiers, his army and its leaders were possibly more to blame than he."

Together with most of the Japanese battleships, the division opened fire at 14:10 on the Russian battleship [...] Shortly afterwards, Asama was damaged by a shell that knocked out her steering that forced her to fall out of formation. Around 15:35, the Russian battleship [...] suddenly appeared out of the mist at short range. Kamimura's ships engaged her for five minutes before she disappeared back into the mists. Asama rejoined the division at 15:50, but further hits caused serious flooding that again caused her to fall out of formation about 20 minutes later. She finally caught up to the division at 17:05. Shortly afterwards, Kamimura led his division in a fruitless pursuit of some of the Russian cruisers around 17:30.

He was successful, but she was badly damaged in the process. Observers noted that her bow was badly damaged and that there was a large hole in the forward hull on the port side. When the shooting resumed around 18:00, the Japanese concentrated their fire upon the ship and her sister, [...] Imperator Alexandr III sheered out of line to port around 18:30 and capsized, but did not sink until 19:07; there were no survivors.|$|E
