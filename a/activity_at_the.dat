5|$|A recent calm period, {{with almost}} no {{earthquake}} or magmatic activity at Hualālai, has seen the growth of homes, businesses, and resorts on the mountain's flanks. The most recent major <b>activity</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> volcano was in 1929, when an intense earthquake swarm rocked Hualālai, most likely caused by magmatic action near the volcano's peak. Although it has been relatively placid in the recent past, Hualālai is still potentially active, {{and is expected to}} erupt again within the next 100years.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} 1985 and 1987 {{agreements}} with the Parliament of Norway ahead of the 1994 Winter Olympics bid, Lillehammer Municipality was responsible for financing and building all Olympic venues and associated facilities. To fulfill their obligation, the municipality established Lillehammer Olympiske Anlegg (LOA) in 1989. Mr. Haavind was hired as the company's first managing director. At {{the same time the}} Post-Olympics Use Committee was established to ensure <b>activity</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> venues after the Olympics.

5|$|Burial 265 {{was found}} {{at the base of}} the {{stairway}} of Terrace 1 Structure 2 in the acropolis. Ceramics associated with the burial have been dated to the Middle Preclassic Period.

The burial was laid out upon a layer of large stones and was accompanied by a plate and other ceramics as a funerary offering. The child's skull was found underneath the plate itself. Burnt stones and earth were found next to the burial.|$|E

5|$|During December 1965, more {{submarine}} activity occurred 0.9km (0.56mi) {{southwest of}} Surtsey, and another island was formed. It was named Jólnir, {{and over the}} following eight months it appeared and disappeared several times, as wave erosion and volcanic activity alternated in dominance. Activity at Jólnir was much weaker than the <b>activity</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> main vent, and even weaker than that seen at Syrtlingur, but the island eventually grew to a maximum size of 70m (230ft) in height, covering an area of , during July and early August 1966. Like Syrtlingur, though, after activity ceased on 8 August 1966, it was rapidly eroded, and dropped below sea level during October 1966.|$|E
5|$|La Blanca is a Maya {{archaeological site}} in the {{municipality}} of Melchor de Mencos in the northern Petén Department of Guatemala.

5|$|Lava Fork volcano is {{associated}} {{with a small group of}} related volcanoes called the Iskut-Unuk River Cones. This forms part of the much larger Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, which extends from the Alaska–Yukon border to near the port city of Prince Rupert, British Columbia. Eruptive <b>activity</b> <b>at</b> <b>The</b> Volcano is relatively young compared to most other volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. Geologic studies have shown that The Volcano and its eruptive products were emplaced in the past 400years; this is well after the last glacial period, which ended about 10,000years ago.|$|E

5|$|Most of the <b>activity</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Marysvale {{volcanic}} field {{occurred during}} three separate intervals; ~3422mya, 2214mya and 95mya.

Crystal-rich ash from the 27-million-year-old (myo) Three Creeks caldera, 24myo Big John caldera and 23myo Monroe Peak caldera hardened into tuff. The second and third intervals saw eruptions of great quantities of rhyolites. Alkali-rich rhyolite erupted in the second interval from the 19myo Mount Belknap caldera.|$|E

The French government authorized a lottery; among the prizes were valuable silver plate and a terracotta model of the statue. By the end of 1879, about 250,000francs had been raised.|$|E

5|$|The {{most recent}} {{volcanic}} <b>activity</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Mount Edziza volcanic complex have been hot springs, several {{of which are}} found on the volcano's western flank, including Elwyn springs (36°C or 97°F), Taweh springs (46°C or 115°F), and inactive springs near Mess Lake. The springs are near the youngest lava fields of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex and are most likely associated with the most recent eruptive activity. These hot springs were highly important to the adjacent Tahltan people.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} Tibbers Castle is undocumented, {{and it may}} have been founded in the 12th or 13th century as a timber castle. It was first {{recorded}} in 1298 when Sir Richard Siward, either built the stone enclosure castle or enhanced one which had already been added to the timber structure. King Edward I of England visited the castle the same year. Siward was the Sheriff of Dumfries when the area was {{under the control of the}} English and documentation from this period gives some evidence for <b>activity</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> castle. In 1302, £100 was spent on the structured while it was manned by a 23-strong garrison.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} Neolithic causewayed {{enclosures}} is unclear, {{and they probably}} had a variety of functions. As well as burials, indicating the site at Maiden Castle was important for rituals related to death, pottery from the coast and areas {{to the east and}} west indicate it was used as a meeting place which attracted people over long distances. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the enclosure was abandoned around 3,400BC. Arrowheads discovered in the ditches may indicate that <b>activity</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> enclosure met a violent end.|$|E

5|$|At Aliso Beach, {{the mouth}} of Aliso Creek, lies a {{freshwater}} pond that changes frequently in elevation and extent. Tidal <b>activity</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> creek's mouth results in sediment building gradually up into a sandbar, impounding it in a small lake about 0.2 miles (0.3km) long at its fullest extent. Afterwards, the water level rises upstream of the sandbar until one of two factors causes it to breach: either waves at high tide wash away {{the top of the}} sandbar, or the lagoon rises enough to overtop the sandbar by itself. Once the water level rises above the sandbar, rapid erosion quickly cuts through the sand and drains the approximately 3–5-foot (0.9–1.5 m)-deep lake in a matter of minutes. Peak flows through the sandbar can reach , even if the incoming flow of the creek is nowhere near that size. Because of the raised flow of the creek and the construction of a parking lot in the lagoon area since the 1960s, the lagoon has never been able to fill to its much larger, historic extent without breaching. Species such as the tidewater goby have suffered because of loss of their habitat this way.|$|E
5|$|Eruptive {{activity}} in the Mount Cayley volcanic field is typical of past volcanism elsewhere in the Garibaldi Belt. Large earthquakes would occur under the volcanic field weeks to years in advance as molten rock intrudes through the Earth's rocky lithosphere. The extent of earthquakes and the local seismographs in this region would warn the Geological Survey of Canada and possibly cause an upgrade in monitoring. While molten rock breaks through the crust, {{the size of the}} volcano vulnerable to an eruption would probably swell and the area would rupture, creating much more hydrothermal <b>activity</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> regional hot springs and the formation of new springs or fumaroles. Small and probably significant rock avalanches may result and could dam the nearby Squamish River for a limited amount of time, such as those that occurred in the past without seismic activity and deformation related to magmatic activity. At some point the subsurface magma will produce phreatic eruptions and lahars. At this time Highway 99 would be out of service and the residents of Squamish would have to travel away from the eruptive zone.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{members of}} the Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit {{conducted}} a measured survey of the monument. In 2005, Ashbee noted {{that he had found}} evidence of recent metal detectoring <b>activity</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> site. On 15 May 2007, the Kentish archaeologist Brian Philp was conducting his regular inspection of the monument when the property owner, Mrs Bygrave, pointed out to him an area where the road was beginning to subside. He alerted Kent County Council, who organised for contractors to investigate the reason for the subsidence, which proved to be decades of rabbit burrowing beneath the tarmac. Archaeologists from Kent Archaeological Unit visited the site during the work, discovering a buried sarsen; comparison with older records revealed that this stone had once been upright but had been buried where it stood in the 19th century by workmen who were replacing the trackway with a paved road.|$|E
