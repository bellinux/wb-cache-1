5|$|The {{interior}} {{was to have}} been <b>a</b> <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> Burgesian excess but not a single room was completed to Burges's designs. Of the few interior features that were fully executed, much was altered or diluted by Heathcoat-Amory and his successors. However some of the interiors, such as the library, vaulted hall and the arched red drawing room, remain or have been re-instated.|$|E
5|$|From the exterior, the {{building}} appears austere, as was much of Mountfort's early work: a central tower dominates two flanking gabled wings in the Gothic revival style. However {{the interior was}} <b>a</b> <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> colour and medievalism as perceived through Victorian eyes; it included stained glass windows, and a large double-faced clock, thought {{to be one of}} only five around the globe. The chamber is decorated in a rich, almost Ruskinesque style, with carvings by a local sculptor William Brassington. Included in the carvings are representations of indigenous New Zealand species.|$|E
5|$|Between 1892 and 1895 the Agapemonites {{built the}} Church of the Good Shepherd in Upper Clapton, London. It was {{designed}} by Joseph Morris in a Gothic style. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, {{the outside of the}} church is <b>a</b> <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion. The same four figures, cast in bronze, look out over the four quarters of the Earth {{from the base of the}} steeple. The two flanking weather vanes show a certain symbolic debt to William Blake's Jerusalem depicting, as they do, a fiery chariot and a sheaf of arrows (presumably of desire), while the main steeple is clearly surmounted by a spear. The stained glass windows, designed by noted children's book illustrator Walter Crane, and made by J. S. Sparrow, betray the unconventional nature of the sect as they illustrate the 'true station of womankind'. The church was abandoned after 1956 and now is used by the Georgian Orthodox Church.|$|E

5|$|Buckingham Palace finally {{became the}} {{principal}} royal residence in 1837, on the accession of Queen Victoria, {{who was the}} first monarch to reside there; her predecessor WilliamIV had died before its completion. While the state rooms were <b>a</b> <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> gilt and colour, the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious. For one thing, it was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die down, and consequently the court shivered in icy magnificence. Ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled, and when it was decided to install gas lamps, there was a serious worry about the build-up of gas on the lower floors. It was also said that staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty. Following the Queen's marriage in 1840, her husband, Prince Albert, concerned himself with a reorganisation of the household offices and staff, and with the design faults of the palace. The problems were all rectified by the close of 1840. However, the builders were to return within the decade.|$|E

25|$|While this {{research}} takes place, tragedies occur on Lusitania. Father Estevão Ribeira, the priest attempting to sway a distant warmongering sect of the Pequeninos from their goal of attacking humanity, is {{killed by the}} Fathertree Warmaker, who took Quim hostage and denied him the food with the anti-descolada chemicals, so the descolada infected and killed him on the 7th day of being hostage. Grego Ribeira spurs <b>a</b> <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> humans to burn down the warmaker's forest, but the violent mob gets out of his control, and rampages through the neighboring Pequenino forest instead, massacring many of its inhabitants – the original friends and allies of humanity. Under {{the terms of the}} treaty with Pequeninos, the Hive Queen is brought in to hold the peace, setting a perimeter guard of hive drones around the human colony and preventing further escalation of violence between the two groups. Grego is locked in jail, despite eventually stepping between the surviving Pequeninos and his own riot. The town realizes their horrific rage, and constructs a chapel surrounding the fallen priest's grave, trying to find penance for their actions.|$|E
25|$|The Agapemonites, {{who held}} decidedly {{unconventional}} views on {{marriage and the}} role of women, relocated to Upper Clapton from their spiritual community in Spaxton, Somerset, and had clearly prospered by this time. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, the outside of the church is <b>a</b> <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion.

25|$|The {{issue of}} firmans of this nature, along with universally {{required}} bribes, {{was not unusual}} at this time: In 1801 for example, Edward Clarke and his assistant Cripps, obtained an authorisation from the governor of Athens {{for the removal of}} a statue of Demeter which was at Eleusis, with the intervention of Italian artist Giovanni Lusieri who was Lord Elgin's assistant at the time. Prior to Clarke, the statue had been discovered in 1676 by the traveller George Wheler and since then several ambassadors had submitted unsuccessful applications for its removal, but Clarke had been the one to remove the statue by force, after bribing the waiwode of Athens and obtaining a firman, despite the objections and <b>a</b> <b>riot,</b> <b>of</b> the local population who unofficially, and against the traditions of the iconoclastic Church, worshiped the statue as the uncanonised Saint Demetra (Greek: Αγία Δήμητρα). The people would adorn the statue with garlands, and believed that the goddess was able to bring fertility to their fields and that the removal of the statue would cause that benefit to disappear. Clarke also removed other marbles from Greece such as a statue of Pan, a figure of Eros, a comic mask, various reliefs and funerary stelæ, amongst others. Clarke donated these to the University of Cambridge and subsequently in 1803 the statue of Demeter was displayed at the library. The collection was later moved to the Fitzwilliam Museum where it formed one of the two main collections of the institution.|$|E

25|$|Hutchings & Co {{were awarded}} the {{contract}} {{and the first}} sod was cut at Bareflathills just outside Elgin near the River Lossie by the wife of James Grant on Saturday, 30 November 1851— a large cheering crowd amid the firing of cannons witnessed the ceremony. This point was chosen because it possessed the three most difficult engineering features to be overcome—the bridge over the River Lossie, the road bridge over the track and the very deep cutting. The contractor switched to two 12-hour shifts and had a work force of around 300 navvies. It was reported at the Board meeting held on 2 April 1852, that although the track was half-finished a strike within the workforce had provoked a serious disturbance. There were two stories in circulation regarding the incident. The first of these was that Irish navvies had come onto the job undercutting the locals’ wages {{and the other was}} that the contractor, who was from England, employed English labour and it was they who objected to the Irish. The outcome was that <b>a</b> <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> some sort had taken place and that four of the instigators were arrested and sentenced to various periods of hard labour—a fifth person was to be sent to the Court of Judiciary for trial after assaulting the Sheriff. The result of all this was that the Morayshire Railway was ordered to pay for ten additional police constables to regulate the workforce.|$|E
500|$|Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters {{described}} {{the story as}} [...] "the most surprising of Tintin's adventures", with Hergé having been [...] "determined to push his reexamination of the comic strip even further." [...] He noted that in the story, Castafiore's [...] "dramatic femininity" [...] disrupted the [...] "idea of sociability" [...] that pervaded Marlinspike, with its [...] "proper respect of space, a form of harmony in independence". [...] He added that [...] "this casually alluring tale {{is one of the}} most subtly handled of the adventures; <b>a</b> <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> clues, both real and false, give The Castafiore Emerald an unequaled density", elsewhere referring to it as [...] "a catalogue of mishaps with nothing or no one spared".|$|E
500|$|Façades {{of churches}} often came to {{resemble}} wedding cakes rather than {{places of worship}} as the architects grew in confidence, competence, and stature. Church interiors, which until this date had been slightly pedestrian, came especially in Palermo to be decorated in <b>a</b> <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> inlaid marbles {{of a wide variety}} of colours. Anthony Blunt has described this decoration as [...] "either fascinating or repulsive, but however the individual spectator may react to it, this style is a characteristic manifestation of Sicilian exuberance, and must be classed amongst the most important and original creations of Baroque art on the island". This is the key to Sicilian Baroque; it was ideally matched to the Sicilian personality, and this was the reason it evolved so dramatically on the island. Nowhere in Sicily is the development of the new Baroque style more evident than in Ragusa and Catania.|$|E

500|$|Gil Kaufman from MTV News {{called the}} video [...] "geektastic". Popjustice also gave the video a {{positive}} review, saying: [...] "The video's <b>a</b> <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> costume changes, makeovers, multiple 'scenarios' and Christina even seems {{to look like}} she's having fun. We'd sort of forgotten the single was even coming out, but the video makes it all seem quite exciting." [...] The Sun commented that [...] "has done the impossible – made the blue rinse sexy". Anna Pickard from The Guardian heavily compared Aguilera to Britney Spears in the video, saying: [...] "We're at a final count of four Christinas to five Britneys. [...] We can't be seen to have achieved a perfect Xtina/Britney balance. [...] We'd probably need a guest appearance from Madonna for that". She also felt that [...] "the 30-second Target advert {{is better than the}} whole video. But still: any release that makes it compulsory to type 'Christina Aguilera Keeps Getting Better' is surely a clever ploy".|$|E
500|$|A Trip to the Moon {{is highly}} satirical in tone, {{poking fun at}} nineteenth-century science by exaggerating it in the format of an {{adventure}} story. The film makes no pretense whatsoever to be scientifically plausible; the real waves in the splashdown scene are the only concession to realism. The film scholar Alison McMahan calls A Trip to the Moon {{one of the earliest}} examples of pataphysical film, saying it [...] "aims to show the illogicality of logical thinking" [...] with its satirically portrayed inept scientists, anthropomorphic moon face, and impossible transgressions of laws of physics. The film historian Richard Abel believes Méliès aimed in the film to [...] "invert the hierarchal values of modern French society and hold them up to ridicule in <b>a</b> <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> the carnivalesque". Similarly, the literary and film scholar Edward Wagenknecht described the film as a work [...] "satirizing the pretensions of professors and scientific societies while simultaneously appealing to man's sense of wonder {{in the face of an}} unexplored universe." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} verse, Aguilera {{appears in a}} red 1960's style outfit and listens to music with silver {{spangled}} headphones while a gramophone plays. While singing the second chorus, Aguilera {{is in front of}} photographers; she continues to sing in an inter-cut scene, wearing silver and gold outfits, one trimmed with fur. In the next sequence, Aguilera wears a white and black outfit with a black-sequined beret, and continues dancing through the chorus. At the bridge, she walks through the bar and finds her lover. She pushes him down on a chair and pushes him away across the polished dance-floor. She is then lifted onto the billiard table and continues to sing while the chandelier above her head begins to explode and spark fireworks. At the chorus she appears in a sparkling silver dress and makes the whole club come alive in <b>a</b> <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> dancing. There is a brief funk outro. As the video ends, with the club now empty, Aguilera gently sings [...] "I Got Trouble" [...] again, lying on the piano while the people in the club watch her.|$|E

500|$|Furst {{and the art}} {{department}} deliberately mixed clashing architectural {{styles to}} [...] "make Gotham City the ugliest and bleakest metropolis imaginable". Furst continued, [...] "e imagined what New York City might have become without a planning commission. A city run by crime, with <b>a</b> <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> architectural styles. An essay in ugliness. As if hell erupted through the pavement and kept on going". The 1985 film Brazil by Terry Gilliam was also a notable influence upon the film's production design, as both Burton and Furst studied it as a reference. Derek Meddings served as the visual effects supervisor, while Keith Short helped construct the newly created 1989 Batmobile, adding two Browning machine guns. On designing the Batmobile, Furst explained, [...] "We looked at jet aircraft components, we looked at war machines, we looked at all sorts of things. In the end, we went into pure expressionism, taking the Salt Flat Racers of the 30s and the Sting Ray macho machines of the 50s". The car was built upon a Chevrolet Impala when previous development with a Jaguar and Ford Mustang failed.|$|E
500|$|Remember Last Night? {{was cleared}} by the PCA on September 24, 1935 and {{following}} previews in October, opened on November 4. Financially {{the film was}} a failure that according to Laemmle lost money for the studio. Critical reception was mixed. The Hollywood Reporter called the film [...] "a murder mystery to kid all murder mysteries" [...] and [...] "a riot of comedy spots superimposed on <b>a</b> <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> crime detecting". Whale, the reviewer found, [...] "let himself go in a riotous directorial splurge". Although less effusive, The New York Times praised the film as [...] "good minor fun" [...] and noted the likeable pairing of Young and Cummings. Ed Brophy, Edward Arnold and Arthur Treacher were also singled out for praise. However, the Times concluded that Remember Last Night? should be enjoyed [...] "in moderation" [...] as the [...] "halfwit behavior of the roisterers in the film" [...] may make the viewer come away [...] "with the feeling that one or two additional murders among the madcap principals would have made Long Island a still better place to live in". Variety was strongly disapproving of the film. [...] "The women are more blotto than the men, {{and two of the}} wives are on the make. It's all faintly unwholesome." ...|$|E
