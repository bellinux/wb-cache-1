5|$|Walter married Emma or Emmelina {{and they}} had three sons– Roger, Hugh and Walter. Roger was the heir to Weobley and Walter became Abbot of Gloucester Abbey. Occasionally the elder Walter is claimed to have married twice– once to Emma and once to an Ermeline, but this is {{probably}} a confusion of the variations of Emma's name. Walter and Emma also had a daughter who became a nun at St Mary's Abbey, Winchester. A niece was married to Ansfrid de Cormeilles. Considerable confusion exists about Sybil, the wife of Pain fitzJohn. C. P. Lewis names her <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> Walter, but W. E. Wightman calls her the daughter of Hugh, Walter's son. Yet another pedigree has her <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> Agnes, the daughter of Walter. In this rendition, favoured by Bruce Coplestone-Crow, Agnes was married to Geoffrey Talbot.|$|E
5|$|According to the Ramayana, Surabhi is the {{daughter}} of sage Kashyapa and his wife Krodhavasha, {{the daughter}} of Daksha. Her daughters Rohini and Gandharvi are the mothers of cattle and horses respectively. Still, it is Surabhi who is described as the mother of all cows in the text. However, in the Puranas, such as Vishnu Purana and Bhagavata Purana, Surabhi is described <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> Daksha and the wife of Kashyapa, as well as the mother of cows and buffaloes.|$|E

She is betrothed to Kartikeya by Indra, when he becomes the commander-in-chief of the gods. In south-Indian accounts, Devasena is generally depicted as an antithesis of Valli, her co-wife; together they complete the god. Devasena is generally depicted with Kartikeya and often is also accompanied by Valli.|$|E
5|$|In the Ramayana, Tara is {{addressed}} by Vali <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> the vanara physician Sushena. Sometimes, verses are {{added in the}} Bala Kanda, the first book of the Ramayana, which describe principal monkeys created by various deities: Vali and Sugriva are described as sons of {{the king of the}} gods, Indra and the sun-god Surya respectively; while Tara is described <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> Brihaspati, the guru of the gods. The 12th century Tamil Ramavataram and the Telugu Ranganatha Ramayanam state that Tara and Ruma rose, along with other apsaras, from the ocean of milk during its churning by the gods and the demons, to acquire the elixir of life (amrita). In the Theyyam drama tradition of Kerala, the gods tire and request Vali to help in the churning. When Vali just starts churning, Tara rises from the ocean and thus is gifted to Vali.|$|E

5|$|The {{isotopes}} of nobelium {{are mostly}} produced by bombarding actinide targets (uranium, plutonium, curium, californium, or einsteinium), {{with the exception}} of nobelium-262, which is produced <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> lawrencium-262. The most commonly used isotope, 255No, can be produced from bombarding curium-248 or californium-249 with carbon-12: the latter method is more common. Irradiating a 350μgcm−2 target of californium-249 with threetrillion (3×1012) 73MeV carbon-12 ions per second for ten minutes can produce around 1200 nobelium-255 atoms.|$|E
5|$|Also in 941, the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters {{reports that}} a {{chieftain}} named Áed Albanach was slain amongst a vast host of Dublin Vikings by the invading forces of Amargein mac Cináeda, overking of Uí Failge. The fact that Áed bore a Gaelic personal name, died with the Dubliners, and bore an epithet referring to a Scotsman, could be evidence {{that he was a}} successor of Gebeachan. Further evidence of this may be the record of Mór, a woman attested by the twelfth-century pseudo-historical Caithréim Chellacháin Chaisil, which identifies her as a daughter of a certain Áed mac Echach, and describes her <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> a King of the Hebrides.|$|E

5|$|Harding {{first came}} to know Florence Kling, five years older than he, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> a local banker and developer. Amos Kling was a man {{accustomed}} to getting his way, but Harding attacked him relentlessly in the paper. Amos involved Florence in all his affairs, taking her to work {{from the time she}} could walk. As hard-headed as her father, Florence came into conflict with him after returning from music college. After she eloped with Pete deWolfe, and returned to Marion without deWolfe, but with an infant called Marshall, Amos agreed to raise the boy, but would not support Florence, who made a living as a piano teacher. One of her students was Harding's sister Charity. By 1886, Florence Kling had obtained a divorce, and she and Warren Harding were courting, though who was pursuing whom is uncertain, depending on who later told the story of their romance.|$|E

He {{also introduced}} the Jolly Follies into the story, a group who were based on three separate touring party groups that Hergé had encountered. He had initially considered a number of alternative names for the troupe, including the Turlupins, Turlurans, and Boutentrins.|$|E

While some narrate that she emerged from the churning of the cosmic ocean, others describe her <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> the creator god Daksha, and as the wife of the sage Kashyapa. Still other scriptures narrate that Kamadhenu was in the possession of either Jamadagni or Vashista (both ancient sages), and that kings who tried to steal her from the sage ultimately faced dire consequences for their actions. Kamadhenu plays the important role of providing milk and milk products to be used in her sage-master's oblations; she is also capable of producing fierce warriors to protect him. In addition to dwelling in the sage's hermitage, she is also described as dwelling in Goloka - the realm of the cows - and Patala, the netherworld.|$|E
