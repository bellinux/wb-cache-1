5000|$|A witness may <b>be</b> <b>unavailable</b> for {{a variety}} of reasons. A common reason for a witness to <b>be</b> <b>unavailable</b> <b>is</b> that the witness is {{claiming}} a Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination. Other privileges are also a source of unavailability. Witnesses may also <b>be</b> <b>unavailable</b> because they have died, had memory loss, or simply decided not to cooperate as a witness against the defendant.|$|R

5|$|Last Man Standing: Similar to Deathmatch, the player's {{objective}} is to remain alive longer than their opponents, putting an emphasis on number of deaths rather than kills. Players start with all weapons (except the Redeemer) available, fully loaded, and have a set number of lives. Power-ups, including health and ammunition packs, <b>are</b> <b>unavailable.</b> Once a player runs out of lives, they lose.|$|E

5|$|A Wii console {{running a}} GameCube disc is {{restricted}} to GameCube functionality, and GameCube controller is required to play GameCube titles. A Nintendo GameCube Memory Card is also necessary to save game progress and content, since the Wii internal flash memory will not save GameCube games. Also, backward compatibility is limited in some areas. For example, online and LAN-enabled features for Nintendo GameCube titles <b>are</b> <b>unavailable</b> on the Wii, since the console lacks serial ports for the Nintendo GameCube Broadband Adapter and Modem Adapter.|$|E

5|$|Australia, {{which has}} not progressed beyond {{the first round of}} competition, {{achieved}} its highest finish, 9th, in the 2017 tournament. Unusual for international competition in baseball, the squads selected in the World Baseball Classic tournaments featured players active in Major League Baseball in addition to Minor League, Nippon Professional Baseball and local players. Generally players in the Major Leagues <b>are</b> <b>unavailable</b> for international representative teams due to their contracts with the respective clubs.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} {{carnivorous}} {{nature and the}} beauty of their glistening traps, sundews have become favorite ornamental plants; however, the environmental requirements of most species are relatively stringent and can be difficult to meet in cultivation. As a result, most species <b>are</b> <b>unavailable</b> commercially. A few of the hardiest varieties, however, have made their way into the mainstream nursery business and can often be found for sale next to Venus flytraps. These most often include D. capensis, D. aliciae, and D. spatulata.|$|E
5|$|Exact {{publication}} figures <b>are</b> <b>unavailable</b> {{for this}} book, but a first printing {{of one of}} Heyer's novels in the British Commonwealth often consisted of 65,000–75,000 copies, and each of her books generally sold over 500,000copies in paperback. As with Heyer's other popular fiction, this book was largely ignored by contemporary critics; only after her death did they begin to take more interest in her work.|$|E

5|$|In {{what was}} the first ever game played by the University of Alabama, a team of Birmingham-area high school players lost to the Cadets 56–0 at Birmingham's Lakeview Park. Played on November 11, the game served as a {{practice}} game for Alabama's contest against the Birmingham Athletic Club scheduled for the next day. Although details of the second half <b>are</b> <b>unavailable,</b> touchdowns in the first half were scored by David Grayson, G. H. Kyser, Dan Smith (twice), William Little and T. S. Frazer. The play utilized most throughout the game was a rushing formation developed by Harvard earlier in the season called the flying wedge.|$|E
5|$|It was {{confirmed}} on June 8, 2015, at Apple's WWDC that the iPad 2 would support iOS 9. This makes the iPad 2 the first iPad and only iOS device to support six major versions of iOS. As with previous releases, though, many headline features <b>are</b> <b>unavailable</b> on the iPad 2, including predictive Siri, translucency effects, split-view, slide-over and picture-in-picture multitasking, Low Power Mode and the Health app. iOS 9 {{is said to}} feature performance improvements that may help the aging device function more smoothly, and initial tests suggest {{that it did not}} significantly impact available space. Other A5-based devices will also support iOS 9 including the iPhone 4S (five major iOS versions), the iPad Mini (four major iOS versions) and iPod Touch 5G (four major iOS versions).|$|E

5|$|Loetoeng Kasaroeng is a 1926 fantasy {{film from}} the Dutch East Indies (modern-day Indonesia) which was {{directed}} and produced by L. Heuveldorp. An {{adaptation of the}} Sundanese folktale Lutung Kasarung (The Lost Lutung), the film tells {{of a young girl}} who {{falls in love with a}} magical lutung and stars the children of noblemen. Details on its performance <b>are</b> <b>unavailable,</b> although it is known to have been of poor technical quality and thought to have performed poorly. It was the first film produced in the country and the first to feature a native-Indonesian cast. It is likely a lost film.|$|E
5|$|Each {{game has}} sold {{relatively}} well in its home market. The original game was a commercial success, selling over 120,000 {{units in the}} first week of release and eventually selling over 240,000 copies in Japan. Drakengard 2s first-week sales were similarly impressive, selling 100,000 units. It sold over 203,000 copies by the end of 2005. Drakengard 3 sold just over 15,000 units in its first week, and over 150,000 units by May 2014. The two versions of Nier—Gestalt and Replicant—sold roughly 12,500 and 60,000 copies in their first week respectively. Replicant eventually sold over 121,000 in Japan by the end of May 2010. The series has sold over 770,000 units in Japan as of May 2014. Sales figures for western regions <b>are</b> <b>unavailable.</b> The first two games in the main series have both been included in Square Enix's Ultimate Hits series, re-releases of popular titles developed or published by them.|$|E
5|$|Falling {{electricity}} production may be boosted through drilling additional supply boreholes, as at Poihipi and Ohaaki. The Wairakei power station {{has been running}} much longer, with its first unit commissioned in November 1958, and it attained its peak generation of 173MW in 1965, but already the supply of high-pressure steam was faltering, in 1982 being derated to intermediate pressure and the station managing 157MW. Around {{the start of the}} 21st century it was managing about 150MW, then in 2005 two 8MW isopentane systems were added, boosting the station's output by about 14MW. Detailed data <b>are</b> <b>unavailable,</b> being lost due to re-organisations. One such re-organisation in 1996 causes the absence of early data for Poihipi (started 1996), and the gap in 1996/7 for Wairakei and Ohaaki; half-hourly data for Ohaaki's first few months of operation are also missing, as well as for most of Wairakei's history.|$|E

5|$|Grand Prix {{motorcycle}} {{racing is}} the premier championship of motorcycle road racing, {{which has been}} divided into three classes since 1997: 125cc, 250cc and MotoGP. Former classes that have been discontinued include 350cc, 50cc/80cc and Sidecar. The premier class is MotoGP, which was {{formerly known as the}} 500cc class. The Grand Prix Road-Racing World Championship was established in 1949 by the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), and is the oldest motorsport World Championship in existence. The motorcycles used in MotoGP are purpose built for the sport, and <b>are</b> <b>unavailable</b> for purchase by the general public because they cannot be legally ridden on public roads. From the mid-1970s to 2002, the top class of GP racing allowed 500cc with a maximum of four cylinders, regardless of whether the engine was a two-stroke or four-stroke. Rule changes were introduced in 2002, to facilitate the phasing out of two-stroke engines.|$|E
5|$|In Little Busters! Ecstasy, adult {{elements}} {{were added to}} the gameplay in the form of sexual CGs depicting Riki and a given heroine having sex. Ecstasy extends the story for the scenarios of the heroines in Little Busters!, as well as increasing the number of heroine routes from six to nine. These three heroine routes include scenarios for Kanata Futaki and Sasami Sasasegawa—two supporting characters from Little Busters!—and a new heroine named Saya Tokido who is only featured in Ecstasy. The first time the game is played, these three heroine routes <b>are</b> <b>unavailable</b> to the player until after the Refrain scenario is completed, though the player is given the option to make them immediately available. Ecstasy has several minor additions and changes to the minigames as well, including the addition of weapons available for use in the battle sequences. Also, Ecstasy features the addition of two recurring minigames related to Saya: a shooting game with pistols and navigating a labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{gameplay}} mechanics which {{carried over}} from the previous iterations is V.A.T.S. (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System). While using V.A.T.S., real-time combat is slowed, allowing the player to choose where to shoot the enemy: shooting enemies in the head will typically result in death while shooting their legs can slow them. Weapons can also be shot at to disarm the enemy. Using V.A.T.S. lowers the player's stamina (Action Points, or AP). Some actions <b>are</b> <b>unavailable</b> to the player if their stamina is insufficient, {{in which case the}} player has to wait for their AP to regenerate. The use of Power Armor in combat increases {{the rate at which the}} player's AP are used. The Pip-Boy, a small computer strapped to the character's wrist, also plays a role in both Fallout 4 and Far Harbor. It contains a menu which the player can access to view maps, statistics, data, and items, and when the player is able to visit Far Harbor, the Pip-boy will receive a signal from Valentine's Detective Agency.|$|E
