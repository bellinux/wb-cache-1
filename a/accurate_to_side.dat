40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the accuracy achievable in the spatialization of digital sound using generic head related transfer functions (HRTFs) played back over commodity audio channels readily available in most personal computers (PCs) now in market, using off-the-shelf headphones. We believe that this study is of interest because these are the conditions in which the vast majority of computer users actually experience 3 D sound in consumer applications, such as games. Our analysis suggests that under these conditions localization is much less <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> the <b>sides</b> of the head, and that there is an average localization error of approximately 15 o in the azimuth range [- 75 o...|$|R

50|$|Methods for {{computing}} the {{geodesic distance}} {{are widely available}} ingeographical information systems, software libraries, standaloneutilities, and online tools. The most widely used algorithm is byVincenty,who uses a series which is <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> third order in the flattening ofthe ellipsoid, i.e., about 0.5 mm; however, the algorithm fails toconverge for points that are nearly anti-podal. (Fordetails, see Vincenty's formulae.) This defect is cured in thealgorithm given byKarney,who employs series which are <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> sixth order in the flattening.This results in an algorithm which is <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> full double precisionand which converges for arbitrary pairs of points on the earth. Thisalgorithm is implemented in GeographicLib.|$|R

50|$|The water {{pressure}} hydraulic grade level (HGL) {{corresponding to the}} maximum water surface elevation of the Wachusett Reservoir, feeding the proposed facility by gravity from an overflow elevation of 120.4 m (395 ft Boston City Base Datum, BCB), was selected by the MWRA for design criteria. HGL is used, instead of elevation, data because it is significantly more precise than elevation data. Because 2.31 ft of elevation translates into 1 psi of pressure (for water), calculating pressure to 1 psi precision requires elevation data that's <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> roughly 2 ft. Normal elevation data that is <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> the nearest 10 ft will result in pressure that is <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> roughly 4 psi.|$|R
