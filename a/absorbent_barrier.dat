A finite region {{in the vicinity of the}} edge has a soft (pressure release) boundary condition; the remaining part of the semi-infinite plane is rigid.

40|$|A {{solution}} is {{obtained for the}} problem of diffraction of a plane wave sound source by a semi-infinite plane. A finite region {{in the vicinity of}} the edge has an impedance boundary condition; the remaining part of the half plane is rigid. The problem which is solved is a mathematical model for a rigid barrier with an absorbing edge. It is found that the absorbing material that comprises the edge need only be of the order of a wavelength long to have approximately the same effect on the sound attenuation in the shadow region of the barrier as a semi-infinite <b>absorbent</b> <b>barrier.</b> Also the softer the absorbent lining the greater the attenuation in the shadow of the barrier. In the illuminated region a reduction in the sound intensity level can be achieved by a suitable choice of the absorptive material of the strip and its length. It is found that the effect of the absorptive strip is lost if its length is less than two wavelengths long. For a strip length of six wavelengths or more the system is equivalent to an absorbing half plane...|$|E
40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{of a study}} of a performance of various track-side railway noise barriers, determined by using a two- dimensional numerical boundary element model. The basic model uses monopole sources and has been adapted to allow the sources to exhibit dipole-type radiation characteristics. A comparison of boundary element predictions {{of the performance of}} simple barriers and vehicle shapes is made with results obtained by using the standard U. K. prediction method. The results obtained from the numerical model indicate that modifying the source to exhibit dipole characteristics becomes more significant as the height of the barrier increases, and suggest that for any particular shape, <b>absorbent</b> <b>barriers</b> provide much better screening efficiency than the rigid equivalent. The cross-section of the rolling stock significantly affects the performance of rigid barriers. If the position of the upper edge is fixed, the results suggest that simple absorptive barriers provide more effective screening than tilted barriers. The addition of multiple edges to a barrier provides additional insertion loss without any increase in barrier height...|$|R

A modified ray model has been developed to calculate the sound fields in these complex urban environments. The ray model has been validated by comparing with scale-model experiments and a wave-based computationally intensive numerical scheme. The barrier insertion loss is shown to be dependent on the source/receiver geometry, the acoustical property of the absorbent materials and the configuration of parallel noise barriers.

40|$|Background {{and aims}}   Traffic noise {{barriers}} {{are the most}} important measure to control the environmental noise pollution. Diffraction from top edge of noise barriers is the most important path of indirect sound wave moves towards receiver. Therefore, most studies are focused on  improvement of this kind.   Methods   T-shape profile barriers {{are one of the most}} successful barrier among many different profiles. In this investigation the theory of destructive effect of diffracted waves from real edge of barrier and the wave diffracted from image of the barrier with phase difference of radians is used. Firstly a simple mathematical representation of the zones behind rigid and <b>absorbent</b> T- shape <b>barriers</b> with the highest insertion loss using the destructive effect of indirect path via barrier  image is introduced and then two different profile reflective and absorption barrier is used for  verification of the introduced model   Results   The results are then compared with the results of a verified two dimensional boundary element method at 1 / 3 octave band frequencies and in a wide field behind those barriers. Avery good agreement between the results has been achieved. In this method effective height is used for any different profile barriers.   Conclusion   The introduced model is very simple, flexible and fast and could be used for choosing the best location of profile rigid and absorptive barriers to achieve the highest  performance. ...|$|R
40|$|International audience"A semi-analytical {{solution}} for the two-dimensional scattering of a line source by a cylinder with an arbitrary distribution of surface impedance and its image {{with respect to a}} vertical baffle is derived. This description is used to model the shadowing due to a low-height semi-cylindrical noise barrier close to a tramway. After validation against the boundary element method, this solution is used in a gradient-based optimization approach of the admittance distribution to maximize the broadband insertion loss in a given receiver zone. First, a hypothetical but passive distribution is found, showing an improvement of more than 20 dB(A) with respect to a purely rigid barrier. Second, a feasible optimized surface treatment made of a porous layer and a micro-perforated resonant panel is proposed, with an improvement of 14 dB(A) with respect to an entirely rigid barrier and 8 dB(A) with respect to a uniform <b>absorbent</b> <b>barrier.</b> The optimization provides an automatic way of tuning the resonant panel so that the attenuation is enhanced in the frequency band where the source has the most spectral content. The benefit of using a non-uniform admittance distribution is evaluated in this idealized context to be about 8 dB. ...|$|E
40|$|With the {{development}} of transgenic and specialized mouse strains, there is an increased need for inhalation exposure systems designed for smaller exposure groups. An inhalation exposure chamber, designed specifically for the exposure of up to 40 mice, was characterized. The chamber was fabricated from 0. 32 -cm-thick ((1) /(8) -in) aluminum sheets with outside dimensions of 61 cm long by 32 cm high by 34 cm deep, resulting in an internal volume of 65 L. Two stainless-steel open-mesh cages, separated by an <b>absorbent</b> <b>barrier,</b> can be stacked within the central portion of the chamber. Access is provided through a gasketed door with a safety-glass face. Tests were performed to determine the chamber leakage rate, degree of mixing, and spatial variation of two aerosols within the chamber. Results indicated that the fractional leakage rate was 0. 0003 min(- 1), well below a reported criterion for an operating chamber. Chamber operation gave similar mixing performance with, or without, use of an interior fan. For aerosols with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of 2. 56 micro m and 3. 14 micro m, the spatial variation of particulate matter concentration resulted in coefficients of variation (CVs) of 4. 8 % and 11. 0 %, respectively. These CV values are comparable to those obtained from similar studies involving other inhalation exposure chambers...|$|E
40|$|T-shape profile {{barriers}} {{are one of}} the most successful barriers among many different profiles. It has been shown that using welled diffusers on the top of T-shaped barriers makes a reactive barrier that shows better performance than that of any other used profile barriers compared with their equivalent <b>absorbent</b> <b>barrier.</b> The contribution of the top surface of reactive T-profile barriers to their efficiency in the shadow zone is discussed in this paper. The new multiple impedance discontinuity (NMID) method was used on a few multi-welled surfaces and the application of the findings on the diffuser T-profile barrier along with a descriptive theory of the welled surface effect was presented. An acceptable agreement between the result of the NMID model and BEM method for a few welled surfaces were found. The area-averaged impedance model was also used in the NMID model and it was found that this model can be a good performance indicator for a multi-welled surface. In order to explain the contribution of the top surface of a T-profile barrier, it is adequate to use the NMID model on a mixed ground equivalent to the top surface of the barrier where the source and receiver are located at near the ground where the separation of source and receiver is identical with the overall span of the cap. The effect of average admittance of top surface is dominant and the effect of the impedance discontinuity is overshadowed by this effect...|$|E
40|$|Reactive {{barriers}} {{are one of}} the most promising and novel environmental noise barriers. In this case using Schroeder diffusers (e. g. quadratic residue diffusers) on the top surface of the T-shape barrier was shown to significantly improve the performance of absorbent T-shape barriers. The reasons behind the high performance of diffuser {{barriers are}} considered in this investigation. A question about the diffusivity behavior of Schroeder diffusers when they are utilized on the top of barrier was raised. Diffusion coefficients of a diffuser in different conditions at some receiver locations were predicted by using a 2 D boundary element method. It was found that the diffusion coefficient of diffuser at the top of barrier is so small that the diffusivity of the structure is almost the same as rigid T-shape barrier. To find the barrier’s cap behavior, the total field above the top surface of profile barriers was also predicted. It was found that the lowest total energy is at the receiver side of the cap very close to the top surface,which could demonstrate the effect of top surface on absorbing the energy as wave transfers from source edge toward the receiver side of the cap. In this case the amount of minimum total energy depends on the frequency and the configuration of the top surface. A comparison between the reductions of total field at the source side of the cap with the improvements of barrier’s performance was also done. It was shown that the amount of decrease in total field compared to that of an <b>absorbent</b> <b>barrier</b> “Ref” is directly associated to the amount of improvement in the insertion loss made by the diffuser barrier compared to the “Ref” barrier in the wide area on the ground at the shadow zone. Finally it was concluded that the diffuser on the top of barrier does not act as a diffuser and a kind of similarity between the contribution of diffuser and absorbent material on the top of T-profile barrier is seen...|$|E
