She was buried at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. Her husband died just over a year later. She is the second longest-serving consort in British history (after the present Duke of Edinburgh), having served as such from her marriage (on 8 September 1761) to her death (17 November 1818), a total of 57 years and 70 days.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, it is {{generally}} {{believed to have been}} influenced by Beheiren's anti-Vietnam War activists in the late 1960s and Konica's advertisement in 1971. A more colorful account of this practice claims it was influenced by the American figure skater Janet Lynn during the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Hokkaidō. She fell during a free-skate period, but continued to smile even <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> on the ice. Though she placed third in the competition, her cheerful diligence and persistence resonated with many Japanese viewers. Lynn became an overnight foreign celebrity in Japan. A peace activist, Lynn frequently flashed the V sign when she was covered in Japanese media, and she is credited by some Japanese for having popularized its use since the 1970s in amateur photographs.|$|E
25|$|Manoah {{was told}} by his wife what happened, and Manoah entreated God to let the man of God come again and teach them what to do. God heeded Manoah and sent the angel to the woman <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> alone in the field. Manoah's wife ran and told Manoah, and he {{followed}} her to the angel, and asked him whether {{he was the one}} who had spoken to his wife, and he said that he was. Manoah asked the angel how they should raise the child, and the angel told him that they should do what he had told Manoah's wife: She was not to eat any product of the grapevine, drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing.|$|E

25|$|In 1952, Florence {{attempted}} to swim the 26 miles between Catalina Island and the California coastline. As she began, she was flanked by small boats that watched for sharks and {{were prepared to}} help her if she got hurt or grew tired. After about 15 hours a thick fog set in. Florence began to doubt her ability, and she told her mother, who {{was in one of}} the boats, that she did not think she could make it. She swam for another hour before asking to be pulled out, unable to see the coastline due to the fog. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> in the boat, she found out she had stopped swimming just one mile away from her destination. Two months later, she tried again. The same thick fog set in, but she succeeded in reaching Catalina. She said that she kept a mental image of the shoreline in her mind while she swam. She later swam the Catalina channel on two additional occasions.|$|E
25|$|Nine {{months after}} the downing of Iran Air Flight 655, {{on the morning of}} March 10, 1989, Rogers' wife Sharon escaped uninjured when a pipe bomb {{exploded}} and set fire to her minivan <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> stopped at a red light {{across the street from the}} University Towne Center shopping mall in San Diego. The van was registered in the name of Will Rogers III, and many people at the time of the bombing suspected that terrorism was involved. Five months later, the Associated Press reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had shifted focus away from terrorism towards the possibility of someone with a personal vendetta against Capt. Rogers. As of 2003, the bombing of Rogers' van remains an unsolved case, despite a major investigation involving at some time up to 300 police and FBI agents. On February 17, 1993, the case was featured on the TV show Unsolved Mysteries, but no additional information was uncovered.|$|E
25|$|Over the {{following}} days, Chikatilo confessed to a further 22 killings {{which had not}} been connected to the case, either because the murders had been committed outside the Rostov Oblast, because the bodies had not been found, or, {{in the case of}} Yelena Zakotnova, because an innocent man had been convicted and executed for the murder. (Aleksandr Kravchenko received a posthumous pardon for Yelena Zakotnova's murder.) As had been the case with the victims compiled upon the initial list of charges, Chikatilo was able to provide details of these additional killings only the perpetrator could have known: one of these additional victims, 14-year-old Lyubov Volobuyeva, had lived in south-western Siberia, and had been killed in a sorghum field near Krasnodar Airport on 25 July 1982. Chikatilo recalled that he had killed Volobuyeva in a millet field, and that he had approached the girl <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> in the waiting rooms at Krasnodar Airport. Volobuyeva, Chikatilo stated, had informed him she lived in the Siberian city of Novokuznetsk, and was awaiting a connecting flight at the airport to visit relatives.|$|E

500|$|Before his Courier-Mail {{newspaper}} {{interview was}} delivered {{to the public and}} in response to Wotton's actions during the riot, police entered Wotton's home at 4:45am Saturday and used a stun gun {{on the back of his}} leg to arrest him, all the time pointing a rifle at his 15-year-old daughter's head <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> on a bedroom floor. At the time, Wotton became one of 17 defendants, all males, charged in the Palm Island riots and was alleged to be the riot ringleader. At the Townsville Magistrate Court on 29 November, Wotton was charged with [...] "arson (two counts), serious assault on police (three counts), wilful damage and riot causing damage".|$|E
500|$|The {{debate has}} {{inspired}} {{at least two}} satirical Internet urban legends. In 2001, The Onion, an American satirical newspaper, published an article entitled [...] "Harry Potter Sparks Rise in Satanism Among Children," [...] which said that the [...] "High Priest of Satanism" [...] had described Harry Potter as [...] "an absolute godsend to our cause." [...] This article was copied into a chain letter and circulated among Christians as [...] "proof" [...] of their views. The following year the Canadian daily the National Post released a similar spoof article in its satirical column Post Morten, saying that [...] "Rowling—or, as she shall henceforth be referred to and credited as, Mrs. J. K. Satan—said that <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> {{in a coffee shop}} one grey day, wondering what to do with her empty, aimless life, it hit her, 'I'll give myself, body and soul, to the Dark Master. And in return, he will give me absurd wealth and power over the weak and pitiful of the world. And he did!'" [...] This article was also copied into a chain letter and released as [...] "truth" [...] onto the web.|$|E
500|$|On {{her first}} {{televised}} performance of [...] "White Horse", on November 23, 2008, at the 2008 American Music Awards, Swift donned a white evening gown <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> on floral-patterned couch. While promoting the song, she later performed {{it at the}} Nomination Concert for the 51st Grammy Awards, where she coupled it in a medley with a cover of Brenda Lee's [...] "I'm Sorry", and the AOL Sessions. Since, Swift has performed the track at the Studio 330 Sessions, the 2009 CMA Music Festival, the 2009 V Festival, and on Dancing with the Stars. Swift performed [...] "White Horse" [...] on all venues in 2009 and 2010 of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour. During the performances, Swift wore a pastel sundress as performed solely playing an acoustic guitar, {{standing at the edge}} of the stage's runway. In the concert on May 22, 2009, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, Swift sang [...] "White Horse" [...] in duet with American singer John Mayer. Reviewing the June 2, 2010 concert at Verizon Center in Washington, D.C., Dave McKenna of The Washington Post reported, [...] "On 'White Horse,' the chorus of believers also joined in, and threw their young fists in the air to yell Swift's esteem-free but cathartic climax, 'I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well!'" [...] Swift said in a 2012 interview with Cosmopolitan that White Horse is in fact her favorite song to sing live, [...] "a song that I've always been proud of because it's about that really horrible feeling of a one-sided relationship that isn't balanced; it's one-sided. You clearly love him more than he loves you, and you know it. And it's a sinking feeling, but it's also a really intoxicating feeling. And a lot of times girls will end up in these relationships where he's not giving you anything so you'll take the crumbs. In my mind what hurts the most is what they didn't say. It's when they knew I needed to hear something and they wouldn't just say it. They knew I needed commitment or loyalty or reassurance, and they wouldn't give it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the royal}} couple's favored {{craftsmen}} and artists were the cabinetmaker William Vile, silversmith Thomas Heming, the landscape designer Capability Brown, and the German painter Johann Zoffany, who frequently painted {{the king and}} queen and their children in charmingly informal scenes, such as a portrait of Queen Charlotte and her children <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> at her dressing table. In 1788 the royal couple visited the Worcester Porcelain Factory (founded in 1751, and later to be known as Royal Worcester), where Queen Charlotte ordered a porcelain service that was later renamed [...] "Royal Lily" [...] in her honour. Another well-known porcelain service designed and named in her honour was the [...] "Queen Charlotte" [...] pattern.|$|E
2500|$|The few {{young women}} {{compared}} to {{number of young}} men led to the women's being paid unwanted attention. Maud's classmate, Jessie Mary, wrote that the [...] "oys (or young men as I guess they call themselves) abound". She noted that girls were frequently ogled by the boys, who enjoyed teasing them. When a girl was late, the boys would loudly clap <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> down. Each October, the freshman class would elect about twelve positions, including a president and vice president, a treasurer, a class essayist, and a marshal. The marshal was tasked with organizing parties and other social occurrences. Girls were generally barred {{from most of the}} positions. However, an annual tradition of the boys was to [...] "nominate the most precocious girl" [...] and then [...] "gossip about her viciously". Maud was nominated.|$|E
2500|$|The Provisional IRA {{also carried}} out attacks in other {{countries}} such as West Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, where British soldiers were based. Between 1979 and 1990, eight unarmed soldiers and six civilians died in these attacks, including the British Ambassador to the Netherlands Sir Richard Sykes and his valet, Karel Straub. On one occasion, the IRA shot dead two Australian tourists in the Netherlands, claiming its members mistook them for off-duty British soldiers. On another occasion an IRA gunman shot dead Heidi Hazell, a German woman, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> alone in her car. She was parked near a British Army married quarter in Unna. They claimed she had been shot [...] "in the belief {{that she was a}} member of the British Army garrison at Dortmund". Her husband was a British Army staff sergeant.

2500|$|In 2004, Sneaky Sound System {{established}} their own label, Whack Records. Angus recalled being rejected by recording companies when proposing {{an album of}} original material, [...] "We were told by every label we might sell 10,000 copies and it wasn't worth it ... {{so we decided to}} do it ourselves". On 15 November that year, they issued their debut single, [...] "Hip Hip Hooray", on their label and distributed by MGM Distribution. Angus wrote the track, and contributed guitar, keyboards, bass guitar, drums and lead vocals. It appeared on the ARIA Singles Chart Top100. In late May, Hesse indicated that a new album was due later that year. However, he left soon after and the group decided that they required a female vocalist, Angus and D met Connie Mitchell (ex-Primary) by chance in a public park <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> singing and playing guitar to a friend. They asked her to join as lead vocalist, Mitchell later remembered, [...] "I thought they were a bit dodgy ... You know, two guys coming up to you, excited, jumping around a bit, saying 'Come to our studio'". Their second single, [...] "Tease Me", had been recorded before Mitchell joined with lead vocals by D and guest vocalist Pepper (Pip Edwards), it appeared on 18 July 2005, but did not chart.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{both girls}} were repulsed by their father's antics, Mae—having once endured Fred's {{throwing}} {{a vacuum cleaner}} at her when she remonstrated against his fondling her—would develop a mechanism whereby she would succinctly tolerate Fred's sexually fondling her before jokingly brushing aside any efforts he made to take the molestation further, whereas in her autobiography, Mae recollected that Heather, [...] "was affected quite badly by all of this. [...] more than me." [...] A strong suspicion remains that, by 1985 or 1986, Heather {{had been forced to}} engage in intercourse with her father, as by the mid-1980s, she is known to have developed classic symptoms of the distress felt by victims of child abuse: these included habits of her biting her nails until they bled; drinking alcohol; of warily watching her father through {{the corner of her eye}} wherever she was sitting or standing; expressing nervous fragility whenever in the presence of males; her sleep being repeatedly broken by nightmares; and her repeatedly bouncing back and forth <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> on any chair. This distressful behaviour led to both Fred and Rose suspecting Heather held lesbianic inclinations, and also resulted in the girl becoming the increasing recipient of taunts from her father (who had never particularly held a liking toward Heather) that she was [...] "ugly" [...] and a [...] "bitch". On the occasions Heather remonstrated about the abuse to her mother, Rose would simply laugh at her distress.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rare and}} wonderfully warm {{observations}} Berry made of working people {{are perhaps the}} most enduring: [...] "old women, who sat night after night, squat as frogs, drinking, watching, eating and taking all in", [...] "and the publican had got a clean collar and tie on, and all the world was ship-shape--this was happiness." [...] "I once saw a pot-woman dance an impromptu fertility dance...the woman sitting with him had knees the size of hams, and drank a case of bottled beer <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> there." [...] And [...] "then there are the princes of drink, men high in the hierarchy of booze, popes of the tap-room...they manage to live and live with style; to smoke and drink and back horses without ever seeming to concern themselves about money...savour the full richness of the working class who can live without work...I have known such men rear big families on the dole, and strut up the street with a rose in their buttonhole." [...] Then there are the [...] "ordinary men who cannot make ends meet and are under the rule of women...lesser men, who are pestered by women and children, whooping cough and rashes of one sort or another...troubles that reduce an honest man to a worrying machine...all the bellyaching and mither and half-pint scrimping that bogs most men down...the poverty, and the poverty of just being able to make ends meet... bosses and women and children [...] pull men down from their dignity." ...|$|E
