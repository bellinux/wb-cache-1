50|$|The basic {{element of}} the common ion pump is a Penning trap. A {{swirling}} cloud of electrons produced by an electric discharge is temporarily stored in the <b>anode</b> <b>region</b> of a Penning trap. These electrons ionize incoming gas atoms and molecules. The resultant swirling ions are accelerated to strike a chemically active cathode (usually titanium). On impact the accelerated ions will either become buried within the cathode or sputter cathode material onto {{the walls of the}} pump. The freshly sputtered chemically active cathode material acts as a getter that then evacuates the gas by both chemisorption and physisorption resulting in a net pumping action. Inert and lighter gases, such as He and H2 tend not to sputter and are absorbed by physisorption. Some fraction of the energetic gas ions (including gas that is not chemically active with the cathode material) can strike the cathode and acquire an electron from the surface, neutralizing it as it rebounds. These rebounding energetic neutrals are buried in exposed pump surfaces.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Three {{aspects of}} glow {{discharges}} have been studied: glow discharge oscillations, sputtering, and coupling between cathode and <b>anode</b> <b>regions</b> {{the two most}} important regions in a glow discharge. Cathode and anode processes are tightly coupled by electron and ion coupling effects. Both electron and ion coupling effects were observed by studying excited Ar atoms in the cathode and <b>anode</b> <b>regions</b> and observing laser-induced space charge variations and the optogalvanic effect. Laser-induced space charge variations in the glow discharge were observed by the change in potential of an electrical probe. This signal, called the optopotential signal, provides useful information about the cathode and anode processes, and may become another useful spectroscopic detection method. Glow discharge oscillations are old phenomena but our mechanistic understanding of the processes involved continues to grow. A mechanism study is important especially now since a new type of sensitive GC detector is being developed based on this phenomenon. A SPAN model of glow discharge oscillation is proposed: source formation, propagation, accumulation, and neutralization of space charges. Electrode coupling couples the neutralization and source formation processes thus completing the feedback loop necessary for some of the observed oscillations to occur. Four modes of oscillations were found. Emission, space potential and current monitoring, and forced oscillations were used to monitor and identify the mechanisms. Studies of cathodic sputtering with gas flow rates up to 2. 13 L/min/jet were carried out in an Atomsource sputtering atomizer with Ar as the jet gas and Cu as the cathode sample. These flow rates are 20 -fold greater than those normally used and were found to increase net sputtering yield significantly. A fourfold increase in net sputtering yield was observed when the number of jets in use was decreased from six to one, with the gas flow rate and other conditions held constant. Possible explanations for these effects are offered...|$|R

40|$|The {{chloride}} {{threshold value}} (Cth), or critical chloride content, {{is defined as}} the chloride concentration at the depth of the reinforcement, which initiates the depassivation of steel in concrete. However, very limited information is available regarding the chloride distributions at the interface with the steel. The main objective of this work is to improve the knowledge and understanding about the mechanisms leading to depassivation of steel in concrete, by studying the influence of the steel surface condition and the concrete-steel interface on the corrosion initiation and the chloride distributions along the concrete-steel interface at the time of depassivation. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) was used for spatial resolved chloride profiling in cementitious materials. A range of materials with increasing degree of heterogeneity (i. e. cement paste, mortar and concrete) and exposed to chlorides under different conditions (i. e. mixed-in, diffused and migrated) was studied. The system was optimized for maximum chloride sensitivity, while allowing for the detection of other elements such as calcium and iron. At a scan speed of 100 µm/s, a spatial resolution of 300 - 400 µm and limits of detection of 0. 05 wt% of cement were determined. The chloride distributions along the concrete-steel interface and possible differences between passive and active regions were studied, for different steel surface conditions under free corrosion conditions as well as under potentiostatic control. The results have shown that along the interface, a range of chloride concentrations can be expected, with higher values around the corroding active sites. It was suggested that chlorides preferentially accumulate at the anodic regions even prior to depassivation, leading to pitting corrosion. A local migration mechanism was proposed to account for the chloride build-up around the <b>anode</b> <b>regions,</b> due to the formation of local potential gradients on the passive layer of the steel as a result of differences in the moisture content and oxygen availability, concentration of aggressive species and metallurgical properties, such as inclusions or mill-scale along the steel.
