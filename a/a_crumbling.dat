5|$|Tension {{came to a}} head on New Year's Eve of 1958, when Atlas {{ordered an}} all-out attack on Ryan. The battle left many dead, and the few sane {{survivors}} barricaded themselves away. What once was a beautiful utopia had fallen into <b>a</b> <b>crumbling</b> dystopia. Some of the events described above are revisited and expanded upon in the downloadable expansion , which takes place in Rapture during the latter months of 1958 and leads up to Atlas' assault on Ryan's forces.|$|E
5|$|Anderitum {{fell into}} ruin {{following}} {{the end of}} the Roman occupation but was reoccupied in 1066 by the Normans, for whom it became a key strategic bulwark. A stone keep and fortification was built within the Roman walls and faced several sieges. Although its garrison was twice starved into surrender, it was never successfully stormed. The castle was occupied more or less continuously until the 16th century, apart from a possible break in the early 13th century when it was slighted. It had been abandoned again by the late 16th century and remained <b>a</b> <b>crumbling,</b> partly overgrown ruin until it was acquired by the state in 1925.|$|E
50|$|In 1650, the Parliament of Aix-en-Provence {{commissioned}} {{the building of}} a thoroughfare for carts where there was <b>a</b> <b>crumbled</b> rampart. The idea was for it to become the new place of dalliance for Aix dwellers, instead of the place des Prêcheurs.|$|R

50|$|On May 2, 1887, {{a strong}} earthquake, felt {{as far north}} as Central Arizona, reduced the church of San Miguel de Bavispe to <b>a</b> <b>crumbled</b> wreck and left every home in the village uninhabitable.

5|$|During the {{communist}} era, {{the legacy of}} Kafka's work for Eastern bloc socialism was hotly debated. Opinions ranged from {{the notion that he}} satirised the bureaucratic bungling of <b>a</b> <b>crumbling</b> Austria-Hungarian Empire, to the belief that he embodied the rise of socialism. A further key point was Marx's theory of alienation. While the orthodox position was that Kafka's depictions of alienation were no longer relevant for a society that had supposedly eliminated alienation, a 1963 conference held in Liblice, Czechoslovakia, on the eightieth anniversary of his birth, reassessed the importance of Kafka's portrayal of bureaucracy. Whether or not Kafka was a political writer is still an issue of debate.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{are visible}} in stalls. Behind them is <b>a</b> <b>crumbling</b> wall with three low Romanesque windows. Four shepherds in {{contemporary}} 15th-century clothing are chatting amiably, {{leaning against the}} wall, looking into the shed. Two are positioned {{to the left and}} two to the right; in each pair one is dressed in red and an other in blue. Behind the shed is a small hill where two shepherds herd sheep along a pathway, and beyond is a Netherlandish town with two domed structures in its center, symbolizing Jerusalem and Christ's Passion. The large domed building is based on the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, a replica of which the Adornes family built in Bruges in 1427, called the Jerusalem chapel. A flock of geese is visible high in the sky through the roof's trusses.|$|E
5|$|Running {{throughout}} all the many paths his life could take or has taken, the adult Nemo recurringly awakens in a surrealistic world dominated by argyle patterns. This setting seems artificial, {{like a movie}} set, and often appears to bleed over into his other lives. Following clues that he finds scattered throughout this city, he ultimately arrives at <b>a</b> <b>crumbling,</b> abandoned wooden-framed house. He stumbles upon a DVD player {{hooked up to a}} television screen. In the strangely interactive video, the 118-year-old Nemo converses with the 34-year-old one. He explains that the younger man does not exist. This is a universe where Nemo Nobody was never born, and his consciousness is stuck in some sort of limbo. He states that he is experiencing the story from the end and that he must stay alive until 5:50 AM on 12 February 2092.|$|E

5|$|As {{a medical}} garment, metal corsets endured {{well into the}} 20th century. The Mexican painter Frida Kahlo was a notable wearer of such medical corsets, {{following}} ongoing problems {{as a result of}} a serious road crash she experienced as a teenager. By 1944, Kahlo's doctors had recommended that she wear a steel corset instead of the plaster ones she had mainly worn since the accident; and Kahlo, whose paintings were heavily autobiographical, used the new corset as the basis for one of her best known self-portraits, The Broken Column. In the painting, Kahlo portrays herself weeping with agony, her torso split open revealing that her spine is <b>a</b> <b>crumbling</b> Ionic column, and her damaged body held together by the steel corset. A form of metal corset or orthopaedic brace used in the second half of the 20th century is called a Harris brace after its inventor, R.I. Harris. Harris braces are designed to immobilise the waist whilst healing, and are made with two bendable metal bands worn above and below the waist, and connected with rigid metal supports.|$|E
5|$|After scoring 34 in the First Test at Johannesburg, Harvey amassed 178 in {{the first}} innings of the Second Test at Cape Town, which set up a first innings lead of 248 runs. He then scored 23 not out to guide Australia to an eight-wicket victory in the second innings. This was {{followed}} by an unbeaten 151 in {{five and a half}} hours at Durban, regarded as one of his finest Test innings. Having been dismissed for 75 on a wet wicket {{in the first}} innings, Australia had slumped to 3/59 in pursuit of a victory target of 336. On <b>a</b> <b>crumbling,</b> sticky pitch, the Australians were having extreme difficulty with the spin of Hugh Tayfield and faced their first Test defeat against South Africa for 39 years. Despite a few square cuts, Harvey adapted his game to play a patient innings, prompting heckling from spectators {{for the first time in}} his career. On 40, a ball from Tufty Mann broke through his defence and Harvey thought himself bowled, only to see that the ball had goven for byes. However, Mann and Tayfield began to tire in the heat and Harvey began to score more quickly, reaching 50 in 137 minutes by the lunch break. He registered his slowest ever century on his way to guiding his team to an improbable victory by five wickets. Harvey brought up the winning runs by clipping a ball from Mann to the midwicket boundary.|$|E

50|$|Blueberry pie is a {{pie with}} a {{blueberry}} filling. Blueberry pie {{is considered one}} of the easiest pies to make because it does not require pitting or peeling of fruit.

Praised by several Shakespeare scholars, but dismissed by some traditionalist critics, the film contains {{a considerable amount}} of nudity (mostly male, but also some female, including a scene in which Caliban's mother Sycorax breast-feeds her son), some unconventional casting (Toyah Willcox as Miranda hardly suggests innocent purity) and an unusual setting (<b>a</b> <b>crumbling</b> mansion as opposed to an island).|$|E

50|$|Fort Matachewan was {{a trading}} post {{set up by}} the Hudson's Bay Company in 1867, and is located 8 km north of the town of Matachewan, Ontario. This fort was {{primarily}} used for the fur trade, and as such the natives of the area often travelled to it to sell off their furs and pick up the staples of their diet. The fort was not a town site, but rather a large depot of stores. Eventually, a church was built on the grounds. Today the Fort is <b>a</b> <b>crumbled</b> relic of <b>a</b> time long past.|$|R
25|$|The atoll has no {{economic}} activity.

The fringing reefs may pose a maritime hazard. There is a boat landing area along the middle of the sandy beach on the west coast, as well as <b>a</b> <b>crumbling</b> day beacon. The island is visited every two years by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.|$|E
