5|$|Many of {{the same}} agents cause {{gastroenteritis}} in cats and dogs as in humans. The most common organisms are Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, and Salmonella. A large number of toxic plants may <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Neutrophil granulocytes—the most {{abundant}} type of white blood cell—enter the muscle tissue, producing an inflammatory reaction and releasing reactive oxygen species, particularly after crush injury. Crush syndrome may <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> reperfusion injury when {{blood flow to}} decompressed muscle is suddenly restored.|$|E
5|$|Planting near {{other members}} of the cabbage family, or where these plants have been placed in {{previous}} years, can prompt the spread of pests and disease. Excessive water and excessive heat can <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> cultivation problems.|$|E
50|$|Bradykinin is {{a potent}} endothelium-dependent vasodilator, leading to a drop in blood pressure. It <b>also</b> <b>causes</b> {{contraction}} of non-vascular smooth muscle in the bronchus and gut, increases vascular permeability and is also involved in the mechanism of pain. Bradykinin <b>also</b> <b>causes</b> natriuresis, contributing to the drop in blood pressure.|$|R

5|$|The {{spread of}} {{pancreatic}} cancer to other organs (metastasis) may <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> symptoms. Typically, pancreatic adenocarcinoma first spreads to nearby lymph nodes, {{and later to}} the liver or to the peritoneal cavity, large intestine or lungs. It is uncommon for it to spread to the bones or brain.|$|E
5|$|These viruses {{are only}} distantly {{related to the}} human parainfluenza viruses, which are RNA viruses {{belonging}} to the paramyxovirus family that are a common cause of respiratory infections in children such as croup, but can <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> a disease similar to influenza in adults.|$|E
5|$|Trivalent {{chromium}} {{occurs in}} trace amounts in foods, wine and water. In contrast, hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI) or Cr6+) is highly toxic and mutagenic when inhaled. Ingestion of chromium(VI) in {{water has been}} linked to stomach tumors, and it may <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> allergic contact dermatitis (ACD).|$|E

5|$|Alprazolam {{and other}} benzodiazepines may <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> the {{development}} of physical dependence, tolerance, and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms during rapid dose reduction or cessation of therapy after long-term treatment. There is a higher chance of withdrawal reactions if the drug is administered in a higher dosage than recommended, or if a person stops taking the medication altogether without slowly allowing the body to adjust to a lower-dosage regimen.|$|E
5|$|Although many natural toxins are {{secondary}} metabolites, these poisons {{also include}} peptides and proteins. An {{example of a}} toxic peptide is alpha-amanitin, which is found in relatives of the death cap mushroom. This is a potent enzyme inhibitor, in this case preventing the RNA polymerase II enzyme from transcribing DNA. The algal toxin microcystin is also a peptide and is an inhibitor of protein phosphatases. This toxin can contaminate water supplies after algal blooms and is a known carcinogen that can <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> acute liver hemorrhage and death at higher doses.|$|E
5|$|Appendicitis {{may present}} with vomiting, {{abdominal}} pain, {{and a small}} amount of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases. This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis. Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea. One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.|$|E

5|$|As {{well as the}} {{evolution}} of new metabolic pathways, evolution can <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> the loss of metabolic functions. For example, in some parasites metabolic processes that are not essential for survival are lost and preformed amino acids, nucleotides and carbohydrates may instead be scavenged from the host. Similar reduced metabolic capabilities are seen in endosymbiotic organisms.|$|E
5|$|Asbestos {{can cause}} a variety of lung diseases, {{including}} lung cancer. Tobacco smoking and asbestos have a synergistic effect on the formation of lung cancer. In smokers who work with asbestos, the risk of lung cancer is increased 45-fold compared to the general population. Asbestos can <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> cancer of the pleura, called mesothelioma (which is different from lung cancer).|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Henson's death, doctor David Gelmont first {{announced}} that he died from Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacterial infection that causes bacterial pneumonia. However, on May 29, Gelmont later confirmed that Henson's {{cause of death was}} organ failure resulting from streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (caused by Streptococcus pyogenes). S. pyogenes is the bacterial species that causes strep throat, scarlet fever, and rheumatic fever. It can <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> other infections.|$|E

5|$|Being a hunt-driven dog, the Jack Russell {{will usually}} pursue most creatures that it encounters. This {{includes}} the skunk, and the breed {{is prone to}} skunk toxic shock syndrome. The chemical in the skunk spray is absorbed by the dog and causes the red blood cells to undergo haemolysis, which can occasionally lead to fatal anaemia and kidney failure. If sprayed underground, it can <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> chemical burning of the cornea. Treatments are available to flush the toxin out of the dog's system.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the {{trochlear nerve}} (IV) can <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> {{diplopia}} with the eye adducted and elevated. The {{result will be}} an eye which can not move downwards properly (especially downwards when in an inward position). This is due to impairment in the superior oblique muscle, which is innervated by the trochlear nerve.|$|E
5|$|Foreign bodies, {{especially}} {{small pieces}} of hay or straw, can become lodged {{in the eyes of}} guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and in some cases an opaque film over the eye due to corneal ulcer. Hay or straw dust can <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> sneezing. While it is normal for guinea pigs to sneeze periodically, frequent sneezing may be a symptom of pneumonia, especially in response to atmospheric changes. Pneumonia may also be accompanied by torticollis and can be fatal.|$|E
