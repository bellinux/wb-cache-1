The geometries considered were angled ground {{at the intersection of}} two planar surfaces, which is a model for slopes neighboring flat land, and a simple conical geometry, representing settings from hilltops to valley bottoms. In each case the radiation source was radioactive cesium fallout, and the slope angle was varied systematically to determine the effect of topography on the <b>air</b> <b>dose</b> rate. Under the assumption of homogeneous fallout across the land surface, and for these geometries and detector locations, the dose rates at high altitudes are more strongly affected by the underlying land topography than those close to ground level.

40|$|The <b>air</b> <b>dose</b> rate in an {{environment}} contaminated with 134 Cs and 137 Cs depends on the amount, depth profile and horizontal distribution of these contaminants within the ground. This paper introduces and verifies a tool that models these variables and calculates ambient dose equivalent rates at 1 m above the ground. Good correlation is found between predicted dose rates and dose rates measured with survey meters in Fukushima Prefecture in areas contaminated with radiocesium from the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. This finding is insensitive to the choice for modelling the activity depth distribution in the ground using activity measurements of collected soil layers, or by using exponential and hyperbolic secant fits to the measurement data. Better predictions are obtained by modelling the horizontal distribution of radioactive cesium across an area if multiple soil samples are available, as opposed to assuming a spatially homogeneous contamination distribution. Reductions seen in <b>air</b> <b>dose</b> rates above flat, undisturbed fields in Fukushima Prefecture are consistent with decrement by radioactive decay and downward migration of cesium into soil.

The relation of the two <b>air</b> <b>dose</b> rates (inside and outside) for each house, including the background from natural radionuclides, was divided into several categories, determined by construction materials (light and heavy) and floor number, with the dose reduction factors being expressed as {{the ratio of the}} dose inside to that outside the house. For wooden and lightweight steel houses (classed as light), the dose rates inside and outside the houses showed a positive correlation and linear regression with a slope-intercept form due to the natural background, although the degree of correlation was not very high. The regression coefficient, i. e., the average dose reduction factor, was 0. 38 on the first floor and 0. 49 on the second floor. It was found that the contribution of natural radiation cannot be neglected when we consider dose reduction factors in less contaminated areas. The reductions in indoor dose rates are observed because a patch of ground under each house is not contaminated (this is the so-called uncontaminated effect) since the shielding capability of light construction materials is typically low. For reinforced steel-framed concrete houses (classed as heavy), the dose rates inside the houses did not show a correlation with those outside the houses due to the substantial shielding capability of these materials. The average indoor dose rates were slightly higher than the arithmetic mean value of the outdoor dose rates from the natural background because concrete acts as a source of natural radionuclides. The characteristics of the uncontaminated effect were clarified through Monte Carlo simulations. It was found that there is a great variation in <b>air</b> <b>dose</b> rates even within one house, depending on the height of the area and its closeness to the outside boundary. Measurements of outdoor dose rates required consideration of local variations depending on the environment surrounding each house.

MethodsData were obtained retrospectively from 7 laboratories participating in the Congenital Cardiac Catheterization Project on Outcomes collaborative. Total <b>air</b> kerma, <b>dose</b> area product, and total fluoroscopy time were obtained for the following procedures: 1) patent ductus arteriosus closure; 2) atrial septal defect closure; 3) pulmonary valvuloplasty; 4) aortic valvuloplasty; 5) treatment of coarctation of aorta; and 6) transcatheter pulmonary valve placement. ResultsBetween January 2009 and July 2013, 2, 713 cases were identified. Radiation dose benchmarks are presented including median, 75 th percentile, and 95 th percentile. Radiation doses varied widely between age groups and procedure types. Radiation exposure was lowest in patent ductus arteriosus closure and highest in transcatheter pulmonary valve placement.

The detailed maps of 134 Cs and 137 Cs as of September 2012 and December 2012 were constructed using {{the relationship between the}} <b>air</b> <b>dose</b> rate and the inventory...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Insulin {{initiation}} and optimization is {{a challenge}} for patients with type 2 diabetes. Our objective {{was to determine whether}} safety and efficacy of AIR inhaled insulin (Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, IN) (AIR is a registered trademark of Alkermes, Inc., Cambridge, MA) using a simplified regimen was noninferior to an intensive regimen. METHODS: This was an open-label, randomized study in insulin-naive adults not optimally controlled by oral antihyperglycemic medications. Simplified titration included a 6 U per meal <b>AIR</b> insulin starting <b>dose.</b> Individual doses were adjusted at mealtime in 2 -U increments from the previous day's four-point self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) (total < or = 6 U). Starting <b>Air</b> insulin <b>doses</b> for intensive titration were based on fasting blood glucose, gender, height, and weight. Patients conducted four-point SMBG daily for the study duration. Insulin doses were titrated based on the previous 3 days' mean SMBG (total < or = 8 U). RESULTS: End point hemoglobin A 1 C (A 1 C) was 7. 07 +/- 0. 09 % and 6. 87 +/- 0. 09 % for simplified (n = 178) and intensive (n = 180) algorithms, respectively. Noninferiority between algorithms was not established. The fasting blood glucose (least squares mean +/- standard error) values for the simplified (137. 27 +/- 3. 42 mg/dL) and intensive (133. 13 +/- 3. 42 mg/dL) algorithms were comparable. Safety profiles were comparable. The hypoglycemic rate at 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks was higher in patients receiving intensive titration (all P <. 0001). The nocturnal hypoglycemic rate for patients receiving intensive titration was higher than for those receiving simplified titration at 8 (P < 0. 015) and 12 weeks (P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Noninferiority between the algorithms, as measured by A 1 C, was not demonstrated. This finding re-emphasizes the difficulty of identifying optimal, simplified insulin regimens for patients. status: publishe...|$|R

The mean annual effective dose obtained in the study area varied from 0.03 – 0.06 mSv., which fall below the worldwide mean annual effective dose value of 0.07 mSv.

40|$|In-situ {{measurement}} of background radiation dose from selected dumpsites in Ota {{and its environs}} was done using Radialert Nuclear Radiation Monitor (Digilert 200). Ten measurements were taken from each dumpsite. The measured background radiation range between 0. 015 mRhr- 1 for AOD and 0. 028 mRhr- 1 for SUS dumpsites. The calculated annual equivalent doses vary between 1. 31 mSvyr- 1 for AOD and 2. 28 mSv/yr for SUS dumpsites. The <b>air</b> absorbed <b>dose</b> calculated ranged from 150 nGyhr- 1 to 280 nGy/hr for AOD and SUS dumpsites respectively with an average value of 217 nGyhr- 1 for all the locations. All the estimated parameters were higher than permissible limit set for background radiation for the general public. Conclusively, the associated challenge and radiation burden posed by the wastes on the studied locations and scavengers is high. Therefore, there is need by the regulatory authorities {{to look into the}} way and how waste can be properly managed so as to alleviate the effects on the populace leaving and working in the dumpsites vicinity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSince the Fukushima accident, Japanese {{scientists}} have been intensively monitoring ambient radiations in the highly contaminated territories situated within 80 km of the nuclear site. The surveys that were conducted through mainly carborne, airborne and in situ gamma-ray measurement devices, enabled to efficiently characterize the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of <b>air</b> <b>dose</b> rates induced by Caesium- 134 and Caesium- 137 in the terrestrial systems. These measurements revealed that radiation levels decreased at rates greater than expected from physical decay in 2011 - 2012 (up to a factor of 2), and dependent {{on the type of}} environment (i. e. urban, agricultural or forest). Unlike carborne measurements that may have been strongly influenced by the depuration of road surfaces, no obvious reason can be invoked for airborne measurements, especially above forests that are known to efficiently retain and recycle radiocaesium. The purpose of our research project is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the data acquired by Japanese, and identify the environmental mechanisms or factors that may explain such decays. The methodology relies on the use of a process-based and spatially-distributed dynamic model that predicts radiocaesium transfer and associated <b>air</b> <b>dose</b> rates inside/above a terrestrial environment (e. g., forests, croplands, meadows, bare soils and urban areas). Despite the lack of site-specific data, our numerical study predicts decrease rates that are globally consistent with both aerial and in situ observations. The simulation at a flying altitude of 200 m indicated that ambient radiation levels decreased over the first 12 months by about 45 % over dense urban areas, 15 % above evergreen coniferous forests and between 2 and 12 % above agricultural lands, owing to environmental processes that are identified and discussed. In particular, we demonstrate that the decrease over evergreen coniferous regions might be due the combined effects of canopy depuration (through biological and physical mechanisms) and the shielding of gamma rays emitted from the forest floor by vegetation. Our study finally suggests that airborne surveys might have not reflected dose rates at ground level in forest systems, which were predicted to slightly increase by 5 to 10 % during the same period of time...|$|E
3000|$|There {{are several}} reports {{containing}} {{estimates of the}} radioactive contamination from the FDNPP accident, presented {{in the form of}} mapped images produced from the results of investigations of radionuclides in the soil (e.g., MEXT 2011 a Sanada et al. 2014; Torii et al. 2013) and in the form of <b>air</b> <b>dose</b> rate figures produced from aircraft observations. Among the radionuclides, radioSr is an important indicator of contamination. The former Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) in Japan reported the following emission estimates within the atmosphere: 89 Sr (half-life, 50.5  days) as 2.0 [*]×[*] 1015  Bq and 90 Sr (half-life, 28.8  years) as 1.4 [*]×[*] 1014  Bq (NISA 2011). Nevertheless, there have been no reports on 89 Sr and 90 Sr in air samples because of analytical difficulty. The detection of nine different γ-emitting radionuclides, including 99 Mo, is described in Appendix 1. However, 89 Sr and 90 Sr emit no γ-rays with their radioactive decay, making it impossible to determine their presence by γ-spectrometry. To evaluate their radioactive pollution levels, the aerosol components were radiochemically extracted from the HV filter sample to analyze the radioSr and assess the emission ratios of 137 Cs, 89 Sr, and 90 Sr.|$|E
40|$|Adjoint Monte Carlo {{can be an}} effcient {{algorithm}} {{for solving}} photon transport problems where {{the size of the}} tally is relatively small compared to the source. Such problems are typical in environmental radioactivity calculations, where natural or fallout radionuclides spread over a large area contribute to the <b>air</b> <b>dose</b> rate at a particular location. Moreover photon transport with continuous energy representation is vital for accurately calculating radiation protection quantities. Here we describe the incorporation of an adjoint Monte Carlo capability for continuous energy photon transport into the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System (PHITS). An adjoint cross section library for photon interactions was developed based on the JENDL- 4. 0 library, by adding cross sections for adjoint incoherent scattering and pair production. PHITS reads in the library and implements the adjoint transport algorithm by Hoogenboom. Adjoint pseudo-photons are spawned within the forward tally volume and transported through space. Currently pseudo-photons can undergo coherent and incoherent scattering within the PHITS adjoint function. Photoelectric absorption is treated implicitly. The calculation result is recovered from the pseudo-photon flux calculated over the true source volume. A new adjoint tally function facilitates this conversion. This paper gives an overview of the new function and discusses potential future developments...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{respiration}} and {{arterial blood}} gas tension following 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane (1, 1, 1 -TCE) inhalation were investigated in anesthetized dogs. In acute in halation experiments, both increase in respiratory rate and {{a decrease in}} amplitude of respiration were observed following inhalation of higher 1, 1, 1 -TCE concentrations. The threshold concentration of 1, 1, 1 -TCE required to produce a increase in respiratory rate was approximately 0. 7 to 0. 9 % in inspired <b>air,</b> and <b>dose</b> response relationship between the increase in respiratory rate and 1, 1, 1 -TCE concentrations which exceeded the threshold level was observed. Moreover, a trancient increase in arterial oxygen tension, a decrease in carbon dioxide tension and an increase in pH were observed following inhalation of higher 1, 1, 1 -TCE concentrations in spontaneous breathing. However, oxygen tension, carbon dioxide tension and pH remained unchanged following inhalation in artificial breathing. It is suggested that alterations of blood gas tension and pH may be based on mainly the increase in respiratory rate resulting from 1, 1, 1 -TCE inhalation in anesthetized dogs...|$|R
40|$|The {{radiation}} hazards of five {{kinds of different}} solid metallic tailings collected from Shangluo, China were determined {{on the basis of}} natural radioactivity measurements using low background multichannel gamma ray spectrometry. The activity concentration of 226 Ra, 232 Th and 40 K in the tailings ranged from 5. 1 to 204. 3, 3. 8 to 28. 5, and 289. 6 to 762. 3 Bq/kg, respectively. The radium equivalent activities and the external hazard indexes of all studied metallic tailings were below the internationally accepted value of 370 Bq/kg and unity, respectively. The internal hazard index of vanadium tailings exceeded unity, while the internal hazard indexes of other analyzed metallic tailings were less than unity. The indoor <b>air</b> absorbed <b>dose</b> rate values for all studied metallic tailings except lead-zinc tailings and gold tailings were higher than the world population-weighted average of 84 nGy/h and the annual effective dose values of all metallic tailings except for vanadium tailings were lower than 1 mSv.
