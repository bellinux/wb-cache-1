5|$|Water {{security}} and food security are inextricably linked. In the decade 1951–60 human water withdrawals were four {{times greater than}} the previous decade. This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the economy—especially the increase in irrigated land, growth in industrial and power sectors, and intensive dam construction on all continents. This altered the water cycle of rivers and lakes, affected their water quality and {{had a significant impact on}} the global water cycle. Currently towards 35% of human water use is unsustainable, drawing on diminishing <b>aquifers</b> and reducing the flows of major rivers: this percentage is likely to increase if climate change impacts become more severe, populations increase, <b>aquifers</b> become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary. From 1961 to 2001 water demand doubled—agricultural use increased by 75%, industrial use by more than 200%, and domestic use more than 400%. In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using 40–50% of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70% for agriculture, 22% for industry, and 8% for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing.|$|E

5|$|The river {{flows through}} the South Downs, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and since 2011, a {{designated}} national park. There are two large <b>aquifers</b> in the area, one consisting of chalk, {{to the south of}} the river valley, and the other the Lower Greensand Group, underlying the whole of the river. The <b>aquifers</b> are separated by a Gault Formation, which consists of clay. At {{the western edge of the}} region, both the chalk and the gault turn to the north, creating a scarp slope. The base flow of the river consists of water from the Lower Greensand aquifer, and from springs along the bottom of the chalk scarp slope. These help to maintain the flows in the river during the summer months, although there have been significant periods where flows have been low, notably in the drought of the early 1990s, and again in 1995/96. These led to declines in the populations of the macro-invertebrates which are used to measure the health of a river, but these have subsequently recovered. In order to monitor the hydrology, the Environment Agency has a series of observation boreholes along the valley, and maintains gauging stations at Princes Marsh, close to the source, at Iping Mill, at Halfway Bridge on the River Lod just above its junction with the Rother, and at Hardham, just before the river joins the Arun.|$|E

5|$|A {{geothermal}} heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground {{anywhere in the}} world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a hot spring. The next best option is to drill a well into a hot aquifer. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock. This last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in Europe, or enhanced geothermal systems in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural <b>aquifers.</b>|$|E
40|$|Chemicals {{leaching}} through soils to groundwater {{mix with}} water already present there. The change in {{concentration of the}} chemical depends upon the concentration of the solution entering the <b>aquifer</b> (the inflow concentration), {{the rate at which}} the solution is entering the <b>aquifer</b> (the recharge rate), the initial concentration of water in the <b>aquifer</b> (the initial concentration), and the amount of water in the <b>aquifer</b> (the product of the porosity and thickness of the <b>aquifer).</b> This software allows a user to modify these parameters and to observe the <b>aquifer</b> concentration as a function of time. The total time required to reach a critical concentration is also displayed. The software is based on a model of a simplified <b>aquifer</b> system. Model Description Consider a steady-flow system. The mass balance equation describing the time variation of average concentration in an <b>aquifer</b> under constant recharge from the surface soil can be written as (Appelo and Postma, 1993; Gelhar, 1993) where n is the effective porosity of the <b>aquifer,</b> H is the average thickness of the <b>aquifer,</b> C is the average concentration in the <b>aquifer,</b> q is the flux density of water entering the <b>aquifer</b> or the <b>aquifer</b> recharge rate, Cin is the inflow concentration, and t is time. Solving the differential equation above for an initial concentration of C 0 yields where C(t) is the average concentration in the <b>aquifer</b> at time t. Assumptions and Simplifications 1. The <b>aquifer</b> is viewed as a ideal mixer or a constantly stirred tank. 2. Water enters the <b>aquifer</b> at a constant recharge rate, q, and constant concentration Cin. 3. Discharge from the <b>aquifer</b> is equal to the recharge and the <b>aquifer</b> is a steady-flow system.

5|$|All of Florida's {{abundant}} {{fresh water}} {{is the result of}} precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called evapotranspiration that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers. However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in <b>aquifers.</b> A surficial aquifer consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content. Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The Floridan Aquifer, underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible {{in the northern part of}} Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from St. Petersburg north to Jacksonville and Tallahassee.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to characterize the Norne <b>aquifer</b> and testing its performance in the reservoir in terms of additional oil recovery factor with <b>aquifer</b> model included in reservoir simulation model by considering the use of Carter-Tracy model, Fetkovich model and van-Everdingen-Hurst (VEH) model. The methodology applied involves four stages: <b>Aquifer</b> characterization, model ranking <b>aquifer</b> modelling and economic analysis. The characteristics of the Norne <b>aquifer</b> considered are <b>aquifer</b> strength and <b>aquifer</b> properties such as <b>aquifer</b> size, <b>aquifer</b> permeability, <b>aquifer</b> porosity and water encroachment angle. The <b>aquifer</b> strength is determined by using diagnostic plots such as a production decline curve of oil rate versus time in semi-logarithm scale and drive indices plot. Estimation of <b>aquifer</b> properties is achieved by using a non-linear regression method in material balance software (MBAL). This approach involves history matching of the average reservoir pressure with computed pressure data by using production data, fluid injection rates and PVT properties. The computed pressure data from the tank model are history matched by regressing the most uncertain parameters in <b>aquifer</b> such as <b>aquifer</b> size, permeability, porosity, and water encroachment angle until the computed pressure matches with historical average reservoir pressure. In model ranking, three models are investigated. These are van-Everdingen-Hurst (VEH) model, Carter-Tracy model and Fetkovich model based on the standard deviation after regression analysis. In <b>aquifer</b> modelling, the Carter-Tracy model in Eclipse software is applied by using the estimated Norne <b>aquifer</b> properties. To introduce the Carter-Tracy <b>aquifer</b> in reservoir simulation model, three keywords are added in Eclipse data file. These are AQUDIMS for specifying dimensions for <b>aquifer,</b> AQUCT which specifies property data for Carter-Tracy <b>aquifer</b> and AQUANCON which specifies connection data for analytical <b>aquifer.</b> In economic analysis, total additional revenue is computed by using two main parameters, additional volume of oil produced with <b>aquifer</b> model included in reservoir simulation model and an average WTI crude oil price for historical period from 1997 to 2006. The findings of this research show that, the van Everdingen and Hurst (VEH) model is the best model to describe the Norne <b>aquifer</b> with standard deviation of 8. 38919, followed by Carter-Tracy model with standard deviation of 19. 57410 and Fetkovich is the least model with standard deviation of 43. 67590. Further, results show the water drive strength in the Norne field is strong with <b>aquifer</b> size approximately {{three times the size of}} the reservoir (as the reservoir radius is 9618 feet), the <b>aquifer</b> permeability is 2495 millidarcy, <b>aquifer</b> porosity is 20. 04 percent, <b>aquifer</b> thickness is 561. 12 feet and water influx angle is 51. 9133 degree. Furthermore, the behaviour of the cumulative water influx into the Norne reservoir is observed to correlate with the average reservoir pressure trend. In addition, by adding an <b>aquifer</b> model in full field Norne reservoir simulation model of 2004, the oil recovery factor is observed to increase by 1. 0 - 1. 6 percent at the end of historical and prediction periods respectively. This means the corresponding total additional revenues between 435. 0 - 696. 1 million USD are generated when the <b>aquifer</b> model is included during the historical and prediction simulation periods respectively. Therefore, including the <b>aquifer</b> in Norne reservoir simulation model improves the Norne field reservoir description for better management of the reservoir...|$|R
