40|$|The Casimir-Polder {{potential}} for interaction between <b>an</b> <b>excited</b> atom and <b>a</b> ground-state {{one in the}} retarded case obtained {{with the help of}} perturbation technique drops as R^- 2 with the distance between the atoms [E. A. Power, T. Thirunamachandran, Phys. Rev. A, 47, 2539 (1993) ]. It results in diverdent integrals for interaction between <b>an</b> <b>excited</b> atom and <b>a</b> dilute gas medium. We investigate interaction between two atoms embedded in a dielectric medium with the help of non-perturbative approach. We take into account absorption of photons in the medium. This approach solves the problem of divergence. We consider interaction between <b>an</b> <b>excited</b> atom and <b>a</b> planar dielectric gas medium of ground-state atoms. We show that the retarded interaction between <b>an</b> <b>excited</b> atom and <b>a</b> gas of ground-state atoms is not oscillating but follows a simple power law. We show that to obtain coventional non-retarded expression for the van der Waals force between <b>an</b> <b>excited</b> atom and <b>a</b> dilute gas the distance between the atom and the interface should be much smaller than the free mean pass of a photon in the medium. Interaction between <b>an</b> <b>excited</b> atom and <b>a</b> hemisphere of ground-state atoms is considered. Comment: 23 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Monolayer {{assemblies}} are rigid {{structures of}} speci-fically designed architecture. Processes {{can be studied}} depen— ding on the relative position of several molecules which in-teract {{with each other to}} form a cooperative system. Appro-priately constructed monolayer assemblies are useful to in-vestigate light induced vectorial charge separation. A number of different arrangements to study electron motions 'ro given, such as the transfer of an electron from <b>an</b> <b>excited</b> dye molecule to an acceptor across the hydrocarbon portion of a monolayer, from an electron source to <b>an</b> <b>excited</b> dye mole-cule, or from <b>an</b> <b>excited</b> dye aggregate to an acceptor. Attempts which have been made to model potential profiles with unsa-turated chains are discussed.

5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> time. A lot of active {{students}} wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E

His producers already had in mind what kind of album they want to produce for Leith. He, however wanted his album to be totally acoustic. Knowing that he was well known by the Australian public as the new Australian Idol, {{he knew that it}} was risky to produce an acoustic based album because it was very different from the records produced by the previous Idol contestants, as many of their records predominantly featured up-beat pop songs. He noted that the music he was making could make the album harder to sell commercially.|$|E

40|$|An excited {{random walk}} is a non-Markovian {{extension}} of the simple random walk, in which the walk's behavior at time n is impacted by the path it has taken up to time n. The properties of <b>an</b> <b>excited</b> random walk {{are more difficult to}} investigate than those of a simple random walk. For example, the limiting speed of <b>an</b> <b>excited</b> random walk is either zero or unknown depending on its initial conditions. While its limiting speed is unknown in most cases, the qualitative behavior of <b>an</b> <b>excited</b> random walk is largely determined by a parameter δ which can be computed explicitly. Despite this, it is known that the limiting speed cannot be written as a function of δ. We offer a new proof of this fact, and use techniques from this proof to further investigate the relationship between δ and speed. We also generalize the standard excited random walk by introducing a "bias" to the right, and call this generalization <b>an</b> <b>excited</b> asymmetric random walk. Under certain initial conditions we are able to compute an explicit formula for the limiting speed of <b>an</b> <b>excited</b> asymmetric random walk.

5|$|Shahîd further {{argues that}} the facts of Philip's alleged Christianity would also {{discourage}} Eusebius from celebrating that emperor. Firstly, Philip lacks <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> conversion narrative; secondly, his religion was private, unlike Constantine's very public patronage of the faith; and, thirdly, his reign only lasted five years, not long enough to enact much amelioration of the Christians' condition. In Shahîd's view, the insignificance of his reign to the progress of Christianity, Eusebius' subject, combined with Eusebius' role as Constantine's panegyrist, explain the tone and content of his account.|$|E

5|$|While {{the league}} struggled, the Grey Cup game itself {{retained}} its popularity and remained a national institution. The {{strength of the}} contest allowed the league to endure its challenges. The CFL survived into 1997 and was buoyed by a new television deal with The Sports Network which, along with the launch of its popular Friday Night Football program, has been credited with saving the league. That year's Grey Cup, held in Edmonton and won by Toronto, drew nearly 22,000 more fans than the previous year. The CFL restored its reputation over time, enjoying new popularity into the 2000s such {{that it no longer}} had to rely on <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> Grey Cup final to achieve stability for the next season.|$|E
5|$|After {{overturning}} a two-goal {{deficit to}} beat Woolwich Arsenal 4–3 {{in a friendly}} at Plumstead, Small Heath took on Aston Villa in their last match of the season, {{the final of the}} Birmingham Charity Cup. Unfortunately for the charities, the weather was poor and the attendance low, but those spectators present saw <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> game. Wheldon scored first with a fierce shot that entered the net off the goalkeeper and the underside of the bar, then Bob Chatt equalised from a free kick and Charlie Athersmith outpaced Oliver and his parried shot was forced over the line. Mobley tied the scores with a long shot, but in the second half with the wind behind them, Villa scored three times to Jack Hallam's one to take the match 5–3.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally {{this was}} <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> period, but Honoré I {{was unable to}} remodel the {{fortress}} in the grand style of a Renaissance palazzo. In spite of the Spanish protection, the risk of attack from France was high and defence remained Honoré's main priority. With this in mind he added two new features: All Saints Tower (F) and the Serravalle Bastion (G). All Saints Tower was semi-circular and guarded {{the end of the}} rock promontory. Complete with gun platforms and cannon, it was connected to man-made caves in the rock itself. Subterranean passages also linked it to the Serravalle Bastion, which was in essence a three-storey gun tower bristling with cannon. Underneath the courtyard a cistern was installed, providing sufficient water for 1000 troops for a 20-month siege, with a huge vaulted ceiling supported by nine columns. Monaco was to remain politically vulnerable for another century and little building work took place from 1581 until 1604, during the reigns of Prince Charles II and Prince Hercule.|$|E

In 2000, he left the Raptors for the Orlando Magic, where {{he became one of the}} league's most prolific scorers and a candidate for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award. In 2004, he was traded to the Houston Rockets, where he paired with center Yao Ming to help the Rockets become a perennial playoff team.

5|$|The next year, 1894, saw {{pay cuts}} and labor disturbances, {{including}} a massive strike by the {{workers at the}} Pullman Company. A group of unemployed workers, known as Coxey's Army, marched on Washington that spring. Weaver met with them in Iowa and expressed sympathy with the movement, {{so long as they}} refrained from lawbreaking. He then returned to the campaign trail, stumping for Populist candidates in the 1894 midterm elections. The election proved disastrous for the Democrats, but most of the gains went to the Republicans rather than to the Populists, who gained a few seats in the South but lost ground in the West. During the election, Weaver became friendly with William Jennings Bryan, a Democratic Congressman from Nebraska and a charismatic supporter of free silver. Bryan had lost his bid for the Senate in the election, but his reputation as <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> speaker made him a presidential possibility in 1896.|$|E

At the following race, the , Webber produced the best qualifying performance of his career up to that point by splitting the dominant Ferraris to line up second on the grid. The race was less rewarding with a near-stall at the start meaning he was well outside the top 10 by the time the cars reached turn 1. An aggressive lap saw him move up to ninth place but during <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> battle with Ralf Schumacher, they collided, forcing Webber to pit with damage to his front wing and tyre. In his desperation to make up for the lost time, Webber exceeded the pitlane speed limit and was handed a drive-through penalty which left him even further behind. More frustration eventually led to the end of his race as he spun into the gravel trap on the outside of the final corner on lap 23.|$|E

He had a sister, Helen, and a brother, Edward. Soon after his birth the family moved across state to the coastal town of New London, Connecticut. He was educated at Harbor Elementary School, where he played violin in the school orchestra, and at Bulkeley High School. In 1938, {{at the age of}} 17, he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, intending to study mathematics, but became interested in physics, particularly particle physics, then emerging as <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> new field. This led him to transfer to the West Lafayette, Indiana, campus of Purdue University, which graduated him in 1942 with a bachelor of Science degree. He then commenced work on his doctorate, assisting Marshall Holloway with the cyclotrons.

5|$|Janáček's {{deep and}} lifelong affection for Russia and Russian culture {{represents}} another {{important element of}} his musical inspiration. In 1888 he attended the Prague performance of Tchaikovsky's music, and met the older composer. Janáček profoundly admired Tchaikovsky, and particularly appreciated his highly developed musical thought {{in connection with the}} use of Russian folk motifs. Janáček's Russian inspiration is especially apparent in his later chamber, symphonic and operatic output. He closely followed developments in Russian music from his early years, and in 1896, following his first visit of Russia, he founded a Russian Circle in Brno. Janáček read Russian authors in their original language. Their literature offered him an enormous and reliable source of inspiration, though this did not blind him to the problems of Russian society. He was twenty-two years old when he wrote his first composition based on a Russian theme: a melodrama, Death, set to Lermontov's poem. In his later works, he often used literary models with sharply contoured plots. In 1910 Zhukovsky's Tale of Tsar Berendei inspired him to write the Fairy Tale for Cello and Piano. He composed the rhapsody Taras Bulba (1918) to Gogol's short story, and five years later, in 1923, completed his first string quartet, inspired by Tolstoy's Kreutzer Sonata. Two of his later operas were based on Russian themes: Káťa Kabanová, composed in 1921 to Alexander Ostrovsky's play, The Storm: and his last work, From the House of the Dead, which transformed Dostoyevsky's vision of the world into <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> collective drama.|$|E
5|$|Under new Head Coach Wim Jansen, Celtic had to {{negotiate}} two qualifying rounds {{to qualify for}} the first round proper of the 1997–98 UEFA Cup. Welsh Inter Cabel-Tel were comfortably disposed of 8–0 on aggregate, but the next qualifying round against Tirol Innsbruck proved more difficult. An abysmal first leg performance in Austria was salvaged only by a late Alan Stubbs free kick, Celtic losing 21 on the night but netting a valuable away goal. The return match in Glasgow was <b>an</b> <b>exciting</b> see-saw affair. Celtic twice took the lead in the first half, only for Innsbruck to equalise on each occasion, their second goal an own goal by Henrik Larsson just before half-time. Goals in the second half from Simon Donnelly and Craig Burley put Celtic ahead on aggregate, but Gernot Krinner's header on 82 minutes levelled the tie on aggregate and gave the Austrians the advantage because of the away goals rule. But Celtic responded with three minutes to go, Wieghorst showed excellent skill in the penalty box to control Donnelly's knockdown before shooting in. With the match going into injury time and the tie poised on a knife-edge, Larsson went on a mazy run forward before passing to Burley who scored from close range to clinch a 63 win on the night to progress on aggregate. Celtic were then drawn against Liverpool in the first round proper.|$|E
