5|$|The Richard Riot was a riot on March 17, 1955 (Saint Patrick's Day), in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The riot {{was named}} after Maurice Richard, the star ice hockey player for the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL). Following a violent altercation on March 13 in which Richard hit a linesman, NHL {{president}} Clarence Campbell suspended him {{for the remainder of}} the 1954–55 NHL season, including the playoffs. Montreal fans protested that the suspension was too severe; the team's largely Francophone fan base claimed the length of the suspension was motivated by Richard's French Canadian ethnicity. Outside of Montreal, however, the suspension was seen as justified <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>anything,</b> too short.|$|E
5|$|William Rolleston, at {{the time}} Provincial Secretary, {{proposed}} to Mary Brittan in early 1865. He was 34 {{at the time}}, and she was 19. Both Joseph and Sophia Brittan were opposed to a marriage, which is surprising, given that Rolleston was intelligent, well educated, successful, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>anything,</b> of higher social standing. They thought him too old for their daughter, her too young to marry. Maybe Sophia Brittan {{did not want to}} lose her daughter, who was in effect running the household and entertained guests, as she was often too ill to look after these tasks herself. But Rolleston was offered and accepted the role of Under Secretary for Native Affairs, which required moving to Wellington. Hence, the wedding went ahead on 24 May 1865 at Avonside Trinity Church, before the newly-weds moved to the capital.|$|E
25|$|The state {{authorities}} in Virginia ruled against N at both locations, and ordered it to accept interlocking (at grade) crossings {{with the new}} Tidewater Railway. The new railroad did accommodate the N with grade separations for crossings at Wabun, west of Salem and Kilby, just west of Suffolk. However, these caused no major construction delays, as N's Johnson had hoped, <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>anything,</b> {{the construction of the}} new Tidewater Railway continued at an even faster pace.|$|E

25|$|Finally, Dawkins {{searches}} {{for an explanation}} of morality based upon evolutionary biology, which he considers more hopeful than ancient texts. Together with the evolutionary psychologist , he discusses the primordial morality to be found among chimpanzees. Curry explains his view that we don't need religion to explain morality <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>anything</b> it simply gets in the way. Instead, he claims, a more convincing explanation {{is to be found}} in the concepts of reciprocal altruism and kin selection.|$|E
25|$|The {{habitat of}} the green heron is small {{wetlands}} in low-lying areas. The species is most conspicuous during dusk and dawn, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>anything</b> these birds are nocturnal rather than diurnal, preferring to retreat to sheltered areas in daytime. They feed actively during the day, however, if hungry or provisioning young. Shore-living individuals adapt {{to the rhythm of}} the tides. They mainly eat small fish, frogs and aquatic arthropods, but may take any invertebrate or vertebrate prey they can catch, including such animals like leeches and mice. Green herons are intolerant of other birds – including conspecifics – when feeding and are not seen to forage in groups. They typically stand still on shore or in shallow water or perch upon branches and await prey. Sometimes they drop food, insects, or other small objects on the water's surface to attract fish, making them one of the few known tool-using species. This feeding method has led some to title the green and closely related striated heron as among the world's most intelligent birds. They are able to hover briefly to catch prey.|$|E
500|$|The {{libretto}} {{has been}} praised by several biographers and historians. One said that [...] "The dialogue contains many an authentic Gilbertian touch." [...] Another found it [...] "a gay, sparkling libretto". Sidney Dark and Rowland Gray wrote that [...] "the book of Thespis is genuine Gilbert, the Gilbert whom nowadays {{all the world}} loves.... Thespis once more emphasizes the fact that Gilbert's artistry was hardly affected {{with the passing of}} the years. Many of its songs might well have appeared in the later operas." [...] They point out Mercury's [...] "I'm the celestial drudge", which anticipates Giuseppe's [...] "Rising early in the morning" [...] in The Gondoliers, and find the [...] "real brand of Gilbertian topsy-turvydom" [...] in the song about the former head of a railway company, [...] "I once knew a chap who discharged a function". Isaac Goldberg thought that [...] "Thespis looks forward far more often than it glances backward: [...] "It forecasts the characteristic methods, and now and then a character, of the later series. Its dialogue is comical, <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>anything,</b> somewhat above the heads of the Gaiety audiences of 1871." ...|$|E

500|$|Never Say Never Again was broadly welcomed {{and praised}} by the critics: Ian Christie, {{writing in the}} Daily Express, said that Never Say Never Again was [...] "one of the better Bonds", finding the film [...] "superbly witty and entertaining,... the {{dialogue}} is crisp and the fight scenes imaginative." [...] Christie also thought that [...] "Connery has lost none of his charm <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>anything,</b> is more appealing than ever as the stylish resolute hero." [...] David Robinson, writing in The Times also concentrated on Connery, saying that: [...] "Connery... is back, looking hardly a day older or thicker, and still outclassing every other exponent of the role, in the goodnatured throwaway with which he parries all the sex and violence on the way". For Robinson, the presence of Connery and Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximillian Largo [...] "very nearly make it all worthwhile." [...] The reviewer for Time Out summed up Never Say Never Again saying [...] "The action's good, the photography excellent, the sets decent; but the real clincher {{is the fact that}} Bond is once more played by a man with the right stuff." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{caused a}} {{tremendous}} {{rise in the}} popularity of wargaming in the early 1970s. [...] The market grew at a fast pace, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>anything</b> the number of wargaming companies grew at an even faster pace. As with any business, most of these were created, produced a few products, and quietly failed, leaving {{little more than a}} footnote {{in the history of the}} industry. [...] Two of these new companies would each last for about two decades and became well known in just a few years: Game Designers' Workshop (GDW), and Tactical Studies Rules (TSR).|$|E

2500|$|Ruby {{made many}} long {{rambling}} statements while in prison. While talking, he disclosed {{that he did}} not vote for Kennedy and had not gone to see the President in the Dallas motorcade. Additionally, despite people's claims that they saw Ruby upset over the weekend of the assassination, others said that he wasn't; On Friday night TV newsman Vic Robertson Jr. saw Ruby at Police Headquarters and reported that Ruby [...] "appeared to be anything but under stress or strain. He seemed happy, jovial, was joking and laughing". Announcer Glen Duncan also testified that Ruby [...] "was not grieving" [...] <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>anything,</b> was [...] "happy that evidence was piling up against Oswald".|$|E

2500|$|The Istrati scandal touches another {{controversial}} {{aspect of}} Stelist policies: their Iron Guard-inherited antisemitism. Stelescu sent {{the message in}} November 1934, when he criticized ethnic minorities for monopolizing the job market: [...] "Factory positions for Romanian workers, our own kind first <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>anything</b> is left we would gladly share it with the foreigner, if he is indeed in need of." [...] According to Veiga, Istrati [...] "toned down the antisemitism of Stelescu and his followers, but the [...] Movement {{continued to be a}} far-right one." [...] Also, [...] "the disillusionment he felt toward Soviet communism did not manage to make Istrati into a fascist; quite the contrary, he was the one to influence Stelescu, making him renounce, for instance, his antisemitism." [...] Among the Crusade men, Prince Karadja witnessed first-hand the application of antisemitic terror in 1930s Germany, and was already taking measures to protect the Jewish Romanian expatriates.|$|E
2500|$|On November 1, Bayern {{started at}} odds of 6.1/1 for the 31st {{running of the}} Breeders' Cup Classic at Santa Anita Park. His opponents {{included}} the undefeated gelding Shared Belief, California Chrome, and Tonalist in a field which appeared dominated by three-year-olds. Exiting the gate, Bayern veered sharply to the left, badly hampering Shared Belief and Moreno before taking the early lead. He was tracked throughout the race by the British-trained Toast of New York with California Chrome close behind and maintained his advantage into the straight. In a closely contested three-way finish, Bayern prevailed by a nose from Toast of New York and a neck from third-place California Chrome. Next to finish were Shared Belief, Tonalist, and Candy Boy, meaning that the first six places were filled by three-year-olds. The racecourse stewards conducted an inquiry into the interference caused by Bayern at the start but allowed the result to stand. After the race, Garcia said, [...] "It's an amazing feeling, a dream come true... We let him run, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>anything</b> happens, you make adjustments. In this race, he broke really good and I took advantage. I was pretty sure that I didn't do anything. In racing, these things happen." ...|$|E
