40|$|The {{nature of}} racial wage {{inequality}} appears to differ across occupation sectors. Specifically, I find {{that all of}} the racial wage inequality in the white-collar job sector can be accounted for by controlling for the <b>academic</b> <b>skill</b> level of each worker, but almost half of the overall racial wage inequality remains in the blue-collar sector after controlling for each worker’s <b>academic</b> <b>skill.</b> Relatedly, after controlling for <b>academic</b> <b>skill,</b> I find that black workers are actually more likely to work in the white-collar sector than white workers. I show that these findings are consistent, and arguably directly implied by, both preference-based and statistical-based models of discrimination. However, omitted variable bias and measurement error also cannot be ruled out as possible explanations. ...|$|R

On the bright side, he enjoys newfound attention from Homer and he covers for them when Marge makes another attempt to stimulate Bart's brain by taking them to a film festival. After Bart's chemistry experiment explodes, filling the school lab with green goo, he confesses to Dr. Pryor that he switched tests with Martin. Dr. Pryor realizes that he was never a genius and has him readmitted to Springfield Elementary.|$|E

In return volunteers work in the museum's public spaces {{as part of the}} front of house teams. In January 2007 the museum launched the in Touch volunteer programme, in partnership with Manchester Museum and supported by £425,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund.

Feedback from trials suggests that significant gains can be made using this embedded approach. Theoretical grounding of design concepts, integration into course activities and collaboration between course lecturers and academic support staff are all key success factors. The authors propose that this integrated approach {{is the most effective}} way to promote <b>academic</b> literacy <b>skills</b> development in large university classes, and that the learning design principles used in this case for Information Literacy could work equally well in other <b>academic</b> <b>skill</b> areas.

40|$|The {{positive}} effects of <b>academic</b> <b>skill</b> remediation with juvenile offenders have been well documented. <b>Academic</b> <b>skill</b> remediation has contributed to reduced recidivism and prosocial behavior for juvenile offenders (Brunner, 1993 b; Katisiyannis & Archwamety, 1999). In addition, remedial reading instruction based on research has also reduced recidivism and increased employment opportunities for juvenile offenders (Brunner, 1993 b). These findings underscore the importance of effective academic remediation for juvenile offenders {{who are committed to}} juvenile facilities. Improvement in reading and writing skills will increase the likelihood of juvenile offenders successfully reentering school and/or employment upon the completion of their commitment programs. Thus, improvement of literacy skills should be a goal of the educational programs of incarcerated juvenile offenders.

40|$|Good <b>academic</b> {{literacy}} <b>skills</b> {{are vital}} {{for success in}} the 21 st century for students in higher education and for professional people in the workforce to be able to process and convey information and knowledge. The purpose of the current study was to gain insights into the construct of <b>academic</b> literacy <b>skills</b> and to identify indicators affecting the development of the <b>academic</b> literacy <b>skills</b> of first year students in higher education. To this end, a case study was done on a cohort of 20 first year male Emirati students attending an <b>academic</b> literacy <b>skills</b> course in an engineering higher education institute in the Arabian Gulf region. The study was guided by three research questions concerning the development of <b>academic</b> literacy <b>skills</b> which were defined as writing strategies, library research strategies and general study skills (Bury, Sheese & Katz, 2013). Data gathered comprised surveys, grade comparisons, written assignments, semi-structured interviews, classroom observations recorded using a video camera and instructor observations. The framework of Academic Literacies developed by Lea and Street (1998, 2000, 2006) was used for analysis with a focus on the supplementing constructs of study <b>skills</b> and <b>academic</b> socialization. To extract more detailed knowledge and further insights about the students’ <b>academic</b> literacy <b>skills,</b> a comparison was also made between the developmental indicators regarding successful and non-successful students’ written work and their approaches to completing assignments. The indicators revealed included the students’ lack of library research strategies, digital literacy skills and sense of ownership. Theoretical and practical implications for developing students’ <b>academic</b> literacy <b>skills</b> are provided in conclusion...|$|R
