25|$|The CBTC {{project was}} first {{proposed}} in 1994 {{and approved by}} the MTA in 1997. Installation of the signal system was begun in 2000. Initial testing began in 2004, and installation was mostly completed by December 2006, with all CBTC-equipped R143 subway cars in service by that date. Due to an unexpected ridership increase on the Canarsie Line, the MTA ordered more R160 cars and these were put into service in 2010. This enabled the agency to operate up to 26 trains per hour up from the May 2007 service level of 15 trains per hour, an achievement that would not be possible without the CBTC technology or a redesign of the previous <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> system. The R143s and R160s both use Trainguard MT CBTC, supplied by Siemens. In the 2015–2019 Capital Program, funding was provided for three more electrical substations for the line so that it could accommodate even more trains per hour. Also included in the Capital Program is the installation of automatic signals on the line to facilitate the movement of work trains between interlockings.|$|E
25|$|Early in 2013, SEPTA {{began to}} {{undertake}} major operational improvements and physical rehabilitation on the Manayunk/Norristown Line. Central to {{this project is}} {{the replacement of the}} 80-year-old wayside <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> system with one that displays only in the operating cab, and operates in both directions on both tracks, thereby allowing greater operational flexibility. Two new remotely controlled interlockings are being constructed to facilitate bidirectional operation, one at Miquon, the other in Norristown between the main station and the Ford Street crossing. An electrified storage track is also being constructed at Miquon to allow for temporary turnback of trains at that station, as the line is periodically subjected to flooding from the Schuylkill River around Spring Mill and Conshohocken. Ongoing replacement of the line's overhead catenary, most of which is 80 years old, will continue along with the signal replacement. Also occurring in conjunction with these projects are the replacement of crossties, renewal of grade crossing surfaces, and trimming of brush and trees alongside the right-of-way. The entire program is scheduled for completion in fall 2015, tying in with the FRA-mandated nationwide implementation of Positive Train Control (PTC) on American railroads by the end of 2015.|$|E
2500|$|The LIRR {{also took}} other steps {{to improve its}} {{physical}} image and its operations. In the 1950s they started a new publicity campaign, adopting a new [...] "Dashing Dan" [...] and [...] "Dashing Dottie" [...] logo and painted its trains in a gray color scheme.The railroad also continued to perform major capital improvement projects. During the 1950s and 1960s the Montauk Branch between Jamaica and Babylon continued going through a massive grade crossing elimination project, with the line being elevated from street level {{over a number of}} years. Mandated by federal and state agencies after the 1950 Kew Gardens (Richmond Hill) train collision, the railroad began to install an Automatic Speed Control system to supplement (and later replace) the wayside <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> system on a majority of its lines. Finally, the LIRR was able to completely replace its steam locomotives with diesels, with the last steam-hauled trains running on October 8, 1955. Two of these PRR G5 class locomotives survive today.|$|E

50|$|The Miami Seaquarium Spacerail was a {{monorail}} at Miami Seaquarium. It was {{the first}} hanging monorail in North America.

There were six cars, though only five were run at a time, and the cars had names after fish. The cars had unique styling until they were redesigned in 1978 to be rectangular and their names were removed. The cars operated around the loop counterclockwise, and had an <b>Automatic</b> <b>Block</b> <b>Signal</b> system.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the early}} 1890s more railroads began {{installing}} electric motor-operated semaphore signals, which were visible at distances {{of thousands of}} feet, {{during the day and}} under inclement weather conditions. In 1893 the high voltage, electric motor <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> semaphore made its debut. By 1898, the US&S Style [...] "B" [...] semaphore, the first successful low voltage, entirely enclosed mechanism electric motor semaphore appeared. It was revolutionary, improving on all earlier semaphore designs, with the last such example being taken out of service as recently as 2009 on the former Siskiyou line of the S.P., now CORPS.|$|E
50|$|On July 25, 1949 the Hirosaki Electric Railway (Hirosaki Denki-Tetsudō Kabushika-kaisha) was established, and {{connected}} Ōwani Station with Chuo-Hirosaki Station by January 26, 1952. The company {{was founded by}} a combination of capital from the Hirosaki city government, and Mitsubishi Electric, with the line intended by Mitsubishi to be a test platform for future local train systems. On October 1, 1970, the Hirosaki Electric Railway was acquired by the Kōnan Railway Company, and its line became the Kōnan Railway Ōwani Line. At the same time all freight operations were suspended. A new <b>Automatic</b> <b>Block</b> <b>Signal</b> system became operational from November 1, 2003. Express services were suspended from November 2006.|$|E

5000|$|... 1915 - Rockledge, Tennessee - Relocation of a Western Union {{telegraph}} line from old alignment to new alignment causes a false clear signal indication when the Western Union wire {{comes in contact}} with the signal wire for the <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> {{at the south end of}} the siding at Rockledge. A southbound freight train departed Rockledge on the false clear indication and collided with a northbound passenger train that had entered the block at Tantallon on a proper clear indication two minutes before the freight train departed Rockledge. A contributing factor was that the tower operator at Rockledge only controlled the signals, the track switches being operated by the train crews themselves.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{particularly}} as trains became longer and faster, and railroad lines grew more congested, the banjo signal was considered to have a single and terminal flaw: visibility. The internal disc was difficult to see in foggy weather and when snow clung to the glass panel. Earlier types of electro-pneumatic semaphores made by US&S had seen some limited application by 1880 as automatic block signals. The need to maintain air pressure in the long pneumatic lines eventually led the railroads to discontinue their widespread use as automatic block signals. However, these types did see long service in interlocking plants. Early semaphores also had limited range with manual wire operation and poor reliability in bad weather. Thus some railroads continued to use disc signals where <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> operation was needed between manual block stations as borne out by period rule books well into the 1920s and beyond.|$|E
50|$|After a crew change, First 1 left Fargo at 3:25 that {{afternoon}} headed by locomotive No.2584, carrying 237 passengers in eleven cars, mostly Pullman sleepers.
