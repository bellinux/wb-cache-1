500|$|<b>Atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> {{spectroscopy}} (AAS) is {{a destructive}} technique that {{is able to}} determine the elements {{that make up the}} analyzed sample. [...] AAS performs this analysis by subjecting the sample to an extremely high heat source, breaking the atomic bonds of the substance, leaving free atoms. Radiation in the form of light is then passed through the sample forcing the atoms to jump to a higher energy state. [...] Forensic chemists can test for each element by using a corresponding wavelength of light that forces that element's atoms to a higher energy state during the analysis. [...] For this reason, and due to the destructive nature of this method, AAS is generally used as a confirmatory technique after preliminary tests have indicated the presence of a specific element in the sample. [...] The concentration of the element in the sample is proportional to the amount of light absorbed when compared to a blank sample. [...] AAS is useful in cases of suspected heavy metal poisoning such as with arsenic, lead, mercury, and cadmium.

40|$|Fast light {{experiments}} are particularly challenging and fascinating {{for the scientific}} community, since superluminal signal velocities can be achieved (however preserving Einstein’s causality). These experiments require inducing a very large anomalous dispersion in the medium at the signal frequency. Sharp <b>atomic</b> <b>absorptions</b> and electromagnetically-induced absorption (EIA) have provided a mean to obtain this large anomalous dispersion. In fibers, the narrowband loss of stimulated Brillouin scattering {{has been used to}} create these conditions. All these methods for obtaining fast light, however, have the common drawback of making the pulse propagate in a spectral region of high absorption. To overcome this impairment, two methods have been devised: one is to propagate the pulse in a region slightly detuned from a gain line, where the group velocity change is negative; the other, more sophisticated approach is {{to make use of the}} large anomalous dispersion appearing between two gain peaks. These methods have been previously demonstrated in atomic vapours. In a previous paper [1] we reported the first experimental demonstration of pulse advancement with gain in optical fibers using stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). We tested the two methods described above to achieve gain-assisted fast light and demonstrated experimentally that the method based on the double Brillouin gain peak produces pulse advancement with lower distortion. However, the distortion achieved in these experiments was still far from ideal, and the underlying scientific challenge to produce fast light with negligible distortion remains intact. In this paper we propose a simple scheme for achieving fast light with low distortion, based on the unique and flexible properties of Brillouin amplification. W...|$|R

The team conducted {{research at the}} AAS Station Lab at Arkansas State University involving macroscopic, microscopic, petrographic thin-sections, <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> and x-ray diffraction analyses. A member of the team, Michael G. Million, also conducted replicative experiments, perhaps the first to do so with the exact clays, tempers and tools used by prehistoric Mississippian potters. Pastes were created {{using a variety of}} temper-to-clay percentages so that vessels as well as test-tiles could be produced for examination. Test tiles gave information about the shrinkage rates of various clay/temper combinations to the 'green' state and then further information upon firing. Simple, round bottom cooking jars were built using coil construction and the Mississippian pottery tool set including a potteryanvil, wooden paddle, mussel shell scrapers and polishing stones. The research discovered that there were very good reasons for using shell tempering for Mississippi Valley clays. The nature of clays formed by such a large meandering river system are distinctive. The huge annually flooded backswamp areas create a clay which is composed of very minute clay particles (primarily silica) and a high proportion of organic content. This is caused by the slow settling or deposition of the alluvial materials after floods. The clay particles tend to measure just a few micrometres in size and in plate-like form. Large amounts of water can be tightly held in the interspace between the clay particles. Add to this the organic ooze, and one has what is known colloquially as [...] "gumbo" [...] clay.|$|E

These points are illustrated by first results from the first three surveys mentioned above.
