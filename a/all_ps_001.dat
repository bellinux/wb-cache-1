The objective {{was to examine the}} impact of stressful life events on heavy alcohol consumption among French adults. Methods: Trajectories of excessive alcohol consumption in 20, 625 employees of the French national gas and electricity company for up to 5 years before and 5 years after an event, with annual measurements from 1992. We used repeated measures analysis of time series data indexed to events, employing generalized estimating equations. Results: For women, excessive alcohol use increased before important purchase (p = 0. 021), children leaving home (<b>p,</b> 0. <b>001),</b> and death of loved ones (p = 0. 03), and decreased before widowhood (p = 0. 015); in the year straddling the event, increased consumption was observed for important purchase (p = 0. 018) and retirement (p = 0. 002); {{at the time of the}} event, consumption decreased for marriage (p = 0. 002), divorce, widowhood, and death of loved one (<b>all</b> <b>p,</b> 0. <b>001),</b> and increased for retirement (p = 0. 035).

40|$|Purpose: Feedback {{devices are}} used to improve chest {{compression}} (CC) quality related to survival rates in cardiac arrest. However, several {{studies have shown that}} feedback devices are not sufficiently reliable to ensure adequate CC depth on soft surfaces. Here, we determined the proper target depth of feedback (TDF) using an accelerometer during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in hospital beds. Methods: In prospective randomized crossover study, 19 emergency physicians performed CCs for 2 minutes continuously on a manikin in 2 different beds with 3 TDFs (5, 6, and 7 cm). We measured CC depth, the proportion of accurate compression depths, CC rate, the proportion of incomplete chest decompressions, the velocity of CC (CC velocity), the proportion of time spent in CC relative to compression plus decompression (duty cycle), and the time spent in CC (CC time). Results: Mean (SD) CC depths at TDF 5, 6, and 7 were 45. 42 (5. 79), 52. 68 (4. 18), and 58. 47 (2. 48) on one bed and 46. 26 (4. 49), 53. 58 (3. 15), and 58. 74 (2. 10) mm on the other bed (<b>all</b> <b>P</b> ?. <b>001),</b> respectively. The proportions of accurate compression depths and CC velocity at TIN 5, 6, and 7 differed significantly according to TIN on both beds (<b>all</b> <b>P</b> ?. <b>001).</b> The CC rate, CC time, and proportion of incomplete chest decompression did not differ on both beds (<b>all</b> <b>P</b> ?. 05). The duty cycle differed significantly on only B 2. Conclusions: The target depth of the real-time feedback device should be at least 6 cm but should not exceed 7 cm for optimal CC on patients on hospital beds. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the research-based association between mixed lateral preference for handedness and risk for {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD) in a large-scale sample of US Army Vietnam veterans exposed to war zone stressors. Method: We used a national sample of 2490 male US Army veterans, who completed the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI), a measure ranging from 100 (pure left-handedness) to 100 (pure right-handedness). We developed several classifications representing levels of mixed laterality: a) an EHI 70 to 70 (EHI 70, moderate mixed); b) an EHI 50 to 50 (EHI 50, consistent mixed); and c) an EHI 0, plus reports of using either hand on 50 % of the tasks assessed (EHI 0, extreme mixed). We controlled for intelligence, race, Army entry age, and Army volunteer status, and we assessed the impact of combat exposure. Results: Although all three handedness measures were associated with current PTSD in bivariate analyses, only Edinburgh 0 was associated with PTSD in the multivariate model (odds ratio (OR) 2. 1; p. 021). However, when we classified handedness by high combat exposure, all three measures were associated with PTSD, with ORs 2. 5, 2. 8, and 4. 7 for EHI 70, EHI 50, and EHI 0, respectively (<b>all</b> <b>p.</b> <b>001).</b> Veterans with mixed laterality and high combat exposure also had significantly increased PTSD symptoms (<b>all</b> <b>p.</b> <b>001).</b> Conclusion: Our study confirmed findings reported among mostly smaller clinical samples and suggested that mixed lateral preference was associated with PTSD, especially among those individuals exposed to more severe psychological trauma...|$|R
40|$|Background: Reliable {{and valid}} scale {{measures}} of barriers to condom use {{are not available}} for young black {{men who have sex}} with men (YBMSM). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Condom Barriers Scales for application with YBMSM. Methods: A clinic-based sample of 600 YBMSM completed a computer-assisted self-interview. The primary measure was a 14 -item abbreviated version of the Condom Barriers Scale. Reliability and criterion validity were assessed. Results: All 3 subscales were reliable: partner-related barriers (Cronbach [alpha]= 0. 73), sensation-related barriers ([alpha]= 0. 70), and motivation-related barriers ([alpha] = 0. 81). A complete absence of barriers was common: 47. 0 % (partner-related), 30. 7 % (sensation-related), and 46. 5 % (motivation-related). Dichotomized subscales were significantly associated with reporting any condomless insertive anal sex (<b>all</b> <b>Ps</b> < 0. <b>001)</b> and any condomless receptive anal sex (<b>all</b> <b>Ps</b> < 0. <b>001).</b> The subscales were significantly associated with these measures of condomless sex preserved at a continuous level (<b>all</b> <b>Ps</b> < 0. <b>001,</b> except for sensation barriers associated with condomless receptive anal sex = 0. 03). Further, the subscales were significantly associated with reporting any condom use problems (<b>all</b> <b>Ps</b> < 0. <b>001)</b> and a measure of condomless oral sex (<b>all</b> <b>Ps</b> < 0. <b>001,</b> except for partner-related barriers= 0. 31). Finally, the sensation-related barriers subscale was significantly associated with testing positive for Chlamydia and/or gonorrhea (P= 0. 049). Conclusions: The 3 identified subscales yielded adequate reliability and strong evidence of validity, thereby suggesting the utility of these brief measures for use in observational and experimental research with YBMSM...|$|R

Background and aims: The recently developed histological scoring system for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by the NASH Clinical Research Network (NASH-CRN) has been widely used in clinical settings, but is increasingly employed in preclinical research as well. However, it has not been systematically analyzed whether the human scoring system can directly be converted to preclinical rodent models. To analyze this, we systematically compared human NAFLD liver pathology, using human liver biopsies, with liver pathology of several NAFLD mouse models. Based upon the features pertaining to mouse NAFLD, we aimed at establishing a modified generic scoring system that is applicable to broad spectrum of rodent models. Copyright: Methods: The histopathology of NAFLD was analyzed in several different mouse models of NAFLD to define generic criteria for histological assessment (preclinical scoring system). For validation of this scoring system, 36 slides of mouse livers, covering the whole spectrum of NAFLD, were blindly analyzed by ten observers. Additionally, the livers were blindly scored by one observer during two separate assessments longer than 3 months apart...|$|R

40|$|Background: Hypertension plays a {{key role}} in chronic kidney disease (CKD), but CKD itself affects the blood {{pressure}} (BP) profile. The aim of this study was to assess the association of BP profile with CKD and the presence of cardiac organ damage. Methods: We studied 1805 patients, referred to our Hypertension Centre, in whom ABPM, blood tests, and echocardiography were clinically indicated. The glomerular filtration rate was estimated (eGFR) using the MDRD equation and CKD was defined as eGFR, 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2. Cardiac organ damage was evaluated by echocardiography. Results: Among patients with CKD there were higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) during the night-time, greater prevalence of non-dippers (OR: 1. 8) and increased pulse pressure (PP) during 24 -hour period, daytime and night-time (<b>all</b> <b>p,</b> 0. <b>001).</b> Patients with CKD had a greater LVM/h 2. 7 index, and a higher prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction (<b>all</b> <b>p,</b> 0. <b>001).</b> Nocturnal SBP and PP correlated more strongly with cardiac organ damage (<b>p,</b> 0. <b>001).</b> Patients with CKD had a greater Treatment Intensity Score (<b>p,</b> 0. <b>001)</b> in the absence of a significantly greater BP control. Conclusions: CKD patients have an altered night-time pressure profile and higher PP that translate into a more severe cardiac organ damage.

40|$|Abstract—This study {{examined}} the importance of aortic dimensions in determining pulse pressure in elderly hypertensives participating in the 2 nd Australian National Blood Pressure Study, including a substantial number not previously receiving blood pressure lowering medication. Aortic dimensions were determined by ultrasound at the transverse arch and at the insertion of the aortic valve. Unadjusted data showed negative (<b>P</b> 0. <b>001)</b> correlations between central (carotid) and (brachial) peripheral pulse pressure and both arch (0. 200, 0. 181) and outflow tract (0. 238, 0. 238) diameters. Correlations were similar in those previously treated with blood pressure lowering medication and in the treatment naı̈ve. Central pulse pressure (8426 versus 7528 mm Hg, <b>P</b> 0. <b>001)</b> was higher and aortic dimensions (transverse arch 2. 560. 31 versus 2. 880. 35 mm, <b>P</b> 0. <b>001)</b> smaller in women than men. Women had greater aortic stiffness (beta index 29. 436. 1 versus 22. 121. 3, P 0. 03). Other bivariate correlates of central pulse pressure were age, mean arterial pressure, height, heart rate, augmentation index, aortic stiffness (<b>all</b> <b>P</b> 0. <b>001),</b> and weight (<b>P</b> 0. 027). In multivariate analyses gender remained a predictor of central pulse pressure (<b>P</b> 0. <b>001)</b> even with inclusion of aortic dimensions (P 0. 013) height and weight.

40|$|Background: In Sweden, {{school meals}} are served {{free of charge}} and Swedish law states that school meals must be nutritious. Nevertheless, data on children’s energy and {{nutrient}} intake from school meals are scarce. Objective: The aim was to describe the contribution of school meals to Swedish children’s nutrient and energy intake during weekdays and compare this to the reference values based on the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR), which have been adopted as the official Swedish recommendations. Design: A cross-sectional food consumption survey was performed on 1, 840 Swedish children attending Grade 2 (mean age 8. 6) and Grade 5 (mean age 11. 7). The children’s nutrient and energy intake was compared to the reference values based on the NNR. Results: The mean intake from school meals of energy, carbohydrates, dietary fiber, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and vitamins D and E did not reach the reference values and the intake of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and sodium exceeded the reference values in both age groups (significant differences, <b>all</b> <b>p</b> 50. <b>001).</b> Additionally, the pupils in Grade 5 did not reach the reference values for folate, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, selenium, and zinc (significant differences, <b>all</b> <b>p</b> 50. <b>001).</b> Standardized for energy, dietary fiber, PUFA, and vitamins D and E did not reach the reference values, whereas the reference values for SF...|$|R
40|$|Background—It is well {{established}} that hypertensive patients with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy have impaired diastolic filling. However, the impact of antihypertensive treatment and LV mass reduction on LV diastolic filling remains unclear. Methods and Results—Echocardiograms were recorded in 728 hypertensive patients with ECG-verified LV hypertrophy (Cornell voltage-duration or Sokolow-Lyon) at baseline and after 1 year of blinded treatment with either losartan or atenolol-based regimen. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP) were reduced on average 23 / 11 mm Hg; isovolumic relaxation time and E/A ratio became more normal, and LV inflow deceleration time prolonged (<b>all</b> <b>P</b> 0. <b>001).</b> Directionally opposite changes in isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) and deceleration time indicate improvement in active LV relaxation and passive chamber stiffness during early diastole. Prevalences of normal LV filling increased, abnormal relaxation and pseudonormalization decreased, and restrictive filling pattern remained unchanged (P 0. 05). Patients with reduction in LV mass had smaller left atrial diameter, shortened IVRT, increased E/A ratio, and prolonged LV inflow deceleration time (<b>all</b> <b>P</b> 0. <b>001).</b> Patients without LV mass reduction had no change in diastolic filling parameters (PNS). IVRT shortening was independently associated with reduction in LV mass. Increase in E/A ratio was independently associated with reduction in diastolic BP, and increase in the deceleration time was independently associated with reduced end-systolic relative wall thickness...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{analyze the}} {{sexuality}} of Italian menopausal women. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. POPULATION: Menopausal women consecutively observed {{during the study}} period in menopause clinics. METHODS: Women were interviewed about their current and premenopausal sexual activity: sexual intercourse frequency and self-rated sexual desire, capacity for orgasm and sexual satisfaction were recorded. Women were defined as having poor sexual functioning if they had one or less sexual intercourses per week or answered 'absent/poor' to the questions about the sexual domains. RESULTS: Oral hormone therapy (HT) use (odds ratio (OR) 0. 43 for desire, 0. 54 for orgasm and 0. 56 for overall sexual satisfaction, <b>all</b> <b>p</b> < 0. <b>001)</b> and transdermal HT (OR 0. 38, 0. 53 and 0. 53, respectively, <b>all</b> <b>p</b> < 0. <b>001)</b> were significantly associated with lower risk of poor sexual functioning. Higher physical and mental component scores (PCS and MCS, range 0 - 100) of the Short Form- 12 are inversely related to poor sexual functioning (OR by point 0. 96, 0. 95, 0. 95 for PCS and 0. 96, 0. 96 and 0. 95, for MCS, respectively, <b>all</b> <b>p</b> < 0. <b>001).</b> Pain during and symptoms after sexual intercourse were significantly related to desire (OR 1. 96 and 1. 78, respectively), orgasm (OR 2. 22 and 2. 06, respectively) and sexual satisfaction (OR 2. 02 and 1. 79, respectively).

40|$|Background. Recently, {{the number}} of elderly {{individuals}} who participate in sports has increased, thus injuries from overuse are now becoming recognized in the elderly population. Therefore, {{it is important to}} determine which muscle groups and tendons are most affected with aging to plan appropriate exercise interventions for elderly individuals. In particular, muscles and tendons in knee extensors and plantar flexors play an important role during locomotion. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the knee extensor and plantar flexor muscles and tendons. Methods. Young (n 19) and elderly (n 17) men performed isometric voluntary knee extension and plantar flexion contractions. Muscle thickness and elongation of tendon structures in knee extensors and plantar flexors were measured by ultrasonography. Results. Relative muscle thickness (to limb length) in the elderly group was significantly lower than that in the young group in knee extensors (<b>p,.</b> <b>001),</b> although no significant difference was found between the two groups in plantar flexors (p. 063). Relative muscle strength (to body mass) in the elderly group was significantly lower than that in the young group in both sites (<b>all</b> <b>p,.</b> <b>001).</b> Ratio of muscle strength to muscle thickness in the elderly group was significantly lower than that in the young group in plantar flexors, but not in knee extensors.

40|$|Multistage {{stepwise}} HIV {{testing and}} treatment initiation procedures {{can result in}} lost opportunities to provide timely antiretroviral therapy (ART). Incomplete patient engagement along the continuum of HIV care translates into high levels of preventable mortality. We aimed to evaluate {{the ability of a}} simplified test and treat structural intervention to reduce mortality. In the "pre-intervention 2010 " (from January 2010 to December 2010) and "pre-intervention 2011 " (from January 2011 to December 2011) phases, patients who screened HIV-positive at health care facilities in Zhongshan and Pubei counties in Guangxi, China, followed the standard-of-care process. In the "post-intervention 2012 " (from July 2012 to June 2013) and "post-intervention 2013 " (from July 2013 to June 2014) phases, patients who screened HIV-positive at the same facilities were offered a simplified test and treat intervention, i. e., concurrent HIV confirmatory and CD 4 testing and immediate initiation of ART, irrespective of CD 4 count. Participants were followed for 6 - 18 mo until the end of their study phase period. Mortality rates in the pre-intervention and post-intervention phases were compared for all HIV cases and for treatment-eligible HIV cases. A total of 1, 034 HIV-positive participants (281 and 339 in the two pre-intervention phases respectively, and 215 and 199 in the two post-intervention phases respectively) were enrolled. Following the structural intervention, receipt of baseline CD 4 testing within 30 d of HIV confirmation increased from 67 %/ 61 % (pre-intervention 2010 /pre-intervention 2011) to 98 %/ 97 % (post-intervention 2012 /post-intervention 2013) (<b>all</b> <b>p</b> < 0. <b>001</b> [i. e., for all comparisons between a pre- and post-intervention phase]), and the time from HIV confirmation to ART initiation decreased from 53 d (interquartile range [IQR] 27 - 141) / 43 d (IQR 15 - 113) to 5 d (IQR 2 - 12) / 5 d (IQR 2 - 13) (<b>all</b> <b>p</b> < 0. <b>001).</b> Initiation of ART increased from 27 %/ 49 % to 91 %/ 89 % among <b>all</b> cases (<b>all</b> <b>p</b> < 0. <b>001)</b> and from 39 %/ 62 % to 94 %/ 90 % among individuals with CD 4 count ≤ 350 cells/mm 3 or AIDS (<b>all</b> <b>p</b> < 0. <b>001).</b> Mortality decreased from 27 %/ 27 % to 10 %/ 10 % for <b>all</b> cases (<b>all</b> <b>p</b> < 0. <b>001)</b> and from 40 %/ 35 % to 13 %/ 13 % for cases with CD 4 count ≤ 350 cells/mm 3 or AIDS (<b>all</b> <b>p</b> < 0. <b>001).</b> The simplified test and treat intervention was significantly associated with decreased mortality rates compared to pre-intervention 2011 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0. 385 [95 % CI 0. 239 - 0. 620] and 0. 380 [95 % CI 0. 233 - 0. 618] for the two post-intervention phases, respectively, for all newly diagnosed HIV cases [both p < 0. 001], and aHR 0. 369 [95 % CI 0. 226 - 0. 603] and 0. 361 [95 % CI 0. 221 - 0. 590] for newly diagnosed treatment-eligible HIV cases [both p < 0. 001]). The unit cost of an additional patient receiving ART attributable to the intervention was US$ 83. 80. The unit cost of a death prevented because of the intervention was US$ 234. 52.

Methods: This community-based analysis included 2071 Chinese residents. Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), GFR, and pulse wave measurements were performed. UACR of 30 – 299 mg/g and GFR of 60 – 89 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 were identified as MAU and mildly decreased GFR. Results: The prevalence of MAU and mildly decreased GFR was 21. 3 % and 33. 2 %.

METHODS: Dynamic CTP was obtained in 14 patients within 8 hours of stroke onset, before IA therapy. Initial quantitative cerebral blood volume (CBV) and flow (CBF) values were visually segmented and normalized in the “infarct core ” (region 1 : reduced CBV and CBF, infarction on follow-up), “penumbra that infarcts ” (region 2 : normal CBV, reduced CBF, infarction on follow-up), and “penumbra that recovers ” (region 3 : normal CBV, reduced CBF, normal on follow-up). Normalization was accomplished by dividing the ischemic region of interest value by that of a corresponding, contralateral, uninvolved region, which resulted in CBV and CBF “ratios. ” Separate CBV and CBF values were obtained in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM).

We {{sought to determine}} the effects of E 2 on apoptotic miRNAs expression and explore the possible mechanism underlying apoptosis in HCC. METHODS: Microarray was performed to analyze alteration of apoptotic miRNAs in E 2 -treated liver cell-line. Expression profiles of selected miRNAs were verified using qRT-PCR. qRT-PCR and Western-blot were used to analyze the alteration of mRNA and protein levels of genes such as p 53, ERa, XIAP and caspase- 3 / 7. Activity of caspase 3 / 7 was measured using a luminescent assay. RESULTS: After E 2 treatment, more than twofold alteration was observed in 25 upregulated and 10 downregulated miRNAs. Expression of miR- 23 a in p 53 -mutated male cell-lines was significantly lower than cell-lines with functional <b>p</b> 53 (<b>all</b> <b>P.</b> <b>001),</b> but not in female cells. p 53 activation increased miR- 23 a expression in p 53 +/+ HepG 2 cells (P. 0001 at 12 h. P. 01 at 24 h), but not in p 53 -/-Hep 3 B cells. E 2 via ERa could significantly activated miR- 23 a (<b>P.</b> <b>001)</b> and <b>p</b> 53 (P. 01) expression, and thus replenished p 53 -deficiency SNU 387 cells in activation of miR- 23 a. Moreover, miR- 23 a mimic and E 2 significantly activated miR- 23 a (<b>P.</b> <b>001)</b> and suppressed the expression of its target XIAP (P. 0001 and P. 01). Decreasing of XIAP contributes to activation of caspase- 3 activity and cell apoptosis. Caspase- 3 mRNA was significantly upregulated with E 2 and miR- 23 a mimic treatment (P. 0001 for E 2, and P. 01 for miR- 23 a mimic). Treatment of cells with anitmiR- 23 a increased XIAP expression (<b>P.</b> <b>001),</b> and abolished caspase- 3 activation (<b>P.</b> <b>001).</b> CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a novel E 2 -signaling mechanism in regulating miRNAs expression and apoptosis that may contribute to sex difference in HCC development.

40|$|Background Asthma is {{a growing}} public health problem in {{developing}} countries. However, few studies have studied the role of urbanisation in this phenomenon. It was hypothesised that children living in a peri-urban setting in Peru have higher rates of asthma and allergy than rural counterparts. Methods 1441 adolescents aged 13 e 15 years were enrolled from two settings: a peri-urban shanty town in Lima (n 725) and 23 rural villages in Tumbes (n 716). Participants filled in questionnaires on asthma and allergy symptoms, environmental exposures and sociodemographics, and underwent spirometry, and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) and allergy skin testing. Indoor particulate matter (PM) concentrations were measured in 170 households. Results Lima adolescents had higher rates of lifetime wheezing (22 % vs 10 %), current asthma symptoms (12 % vs 3 %) and physician-diagnosed asthma (13 % vs 2 %; <b>all</b> <b>p</b> < 0. <b>001).</b> Current rhinitis (23 % vs 12 %), eczema (12 % vs 0. 4 %), atopy (56 % vs 38 %), personal history of cigarette smoking (7. 4 % vs 1. 3 %) and mean indoor PM (31 vs 13 mg/m 3) were also higher in Lima (<b>all</b> <b>p</b> < 0. <b>001).</b> The peri-urban environment of Lima {{was associated with a}} 2. 6 -fold greater odds (95 % CI 1. 3 to 5. 3) of asthma in multivariable regression. Forced expiratory volumes were higher and FEV 1 /FVC (forced expiratory volume in 1 s/ forced vital capacity) ratios were lower in Lima (<b>all</b> <b>p</b> < 0. <b>001).</b> Higher eNO values in Lima (<b>p</b> < 0. <b>001)</b> were attributable to higher rates of asthma and atopy. Conclusions Peri-urban adolescents had more asthma, atopy and airways inflammation and were exposed to more indoor pollution.
