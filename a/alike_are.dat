5|$|Marrakesh {{has long}} been an {{important}} centre for healthcare in Morocco, and the regional rural and urban populations <b>alike</b> <b>are</b> reliant upon hospitals in the city. The psychiatric hospital installed by the Merinid Caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur in the 16th century was described by the historian 'Abd al-Wahfd al- Marrakushi {{as one of the greatest}} in the world at the time. A strong Andalusian influence was evident in the hospital, and many of the physicians to the Caliphs came from places such as Seville, Zaragoza and Denia in eastern Spain.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{threats to}} cockatoos are habitat loss and the wildlife trade. All cockatoos {{are dependent on}} trees for nesting and are vulnerable to their loss; in addition many species have specialised habitat requirements or live on small islands and have naturally small ranges, making them vulnerable {{to the loss of}} these habitats. Cockatoos are popular as pets and the capture and trade has threatened some species; between 1983 and 1990, 66,654 recorded salmon-crested cockatoos were exported from Indonesia, a figure that does not include the number of birds caught for the domestic trade or that were exported illegally. The capture of many species has subsequently been banned but the trade continues illegally. Birds are put in crates or bamboo tubing and conveyed on boats out of Indonesia and the Philippines. Not only are the rare species smuggled out of Indonesia but also common and rare cockatoos <b>alike</b> <b>are</b> smuggled out of Australia; birds are sedated, covered in nylon stockings and packed into PVC tubing which is then placed in unaccompanied luggage on international flights. Mortality is significant (30%) and eggs, more easily hidden on the bodies of smugglers on flights, are increasingly smuggled instead. Trafficking is thought to be run by organised gangs, who also trade Australian species for overseas species such as macaws coming the other way.|$|E

25|$|Yet, {{notwithstanding}} {{this difference}} as to origin, Father is one with, co-equal to, co-eternal, and con-substantial with the Son and the Holy Spirit, each Person {{being the one}} eternal God and in no way separated, who is the creator: all <b>alike</b> <b>are</b> uncreated and omnipotent. Thus, the Divine Unity consists of God the Father, with his Son and his Spirit distinct from God the Father and yet perfectly united together in him. Because of this, the Trinity is beyond reason and can only be known by revelation.|$|E

25|$|In {{the twenty-first}} century, {{a number of}} new factors have {{facilitated}} the comparison of spiritual traditions – and the place of women within them – to an unprecedented level. These include: (i) a fresh wave of technological globalisation, which has obliterated communicational borders; (ii) the advent of cheap mass international air travel, which has hugely increased people's exposure to other cultures; and (iii) the internationalisation of higher education, whereby students and scholars <b>alike</b> <b>are</b> spending ever-increasing amounts of time in countries with different religious demographic compositions to their own.|$|E
25|$|Such {{violence}} against women, especially sexual abuse, is increasingly being documented in areas experiencing armed conflicts. Presently, {{women and girls}} {{bear the brunt of}} social turmoil worldwide, making up an estimated 65% of the millions who are displaced and affected. Some of these places which are facing such problems include Rwanda, Kosovo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This comes as a result of both the general instability around the region, as well as a tactic of warfare to intimidate enemies. Often being placed in emergency and refugee settings, girls and women <b>alike</b> <b>are</b> highly vulnerable to abuse and exploitation by military combatants, security forces, and members of rival communities.|$|E

Part of the Kaunian Empire many centuries ago, about one-tenth of the prewar population were blond ethnic Kaunians, {{the only people in}} Derlavai to speak classical Kaunian as a birth language. Previous to Six Years' War Forthweg was partitioned between Algarve and Unkerlant, but later gained independence after that war. King Penda declared war on Algarve as part of the initial coalition against Algarve, but was attacked by both Algarve and Unkerlant and the country got re-partitioned; later, the whole is occupied by Algarve {{and at the end of}} the war is occupied by Unkerlant, which decides not to annex it outright but make it a satellite. Forthweg has a subtropical climate, with olive and citrus groves a prominent part of its agriculture. Forthwegians and Kaunians <b>alike</b> <b>are</b> extremely fond of gathering mushrooms. Forthweg's largest city as well as its capital is Eoforwic. Forthwegian names are drawn from Old English.|$|E

25|$|The {{essential}} {{feature of}} the morality built upon the basis of Hartmann's philosophy is the realization that all is one and that, while every attempt to gain happiness is illusory, yet before deliverance is possible, all forms of the illusion must appear and be tried to the utmost. Even he who recognizes the vanity of life best serves the highest aims by giving himself up to the illusion, and living as eagerly as if he thought life good. It is only through the constant attempt to gain happiness that people can learn the desirability of nothingness; and when this knowledge has become universal, or at least general, deliverance will come and the world will cease. No better proof of the rational nature {{of the universe is}} needed than that afforded by the different ways in which men have hoped to find happiness and so have been led unconsciously to work for the final goal. The first of these is the hope of good in the present, the confidence in the pleasures of this world, such as was felt by the Greeks. This is followed by the Christian transference of happiness to another and better life, to which in turn succeeds the illusion that looks for happiness in progress, and dreams of a future made worth while by the achievements of science. All <b>alike</b> <b>are</b> empty promises, and known as such in the final stage, which sees all human desires as equally vain and the only good in the peace of Nirvana.|$|E

A primary aspect of Stoicism involves improving the individual's ethical and moral well-being: [...] "Virtue consists in a will that is in agreement with Nature."

500|$|The appellant's {{argument}} {{rested on}} the alleged arbitrariness of the ambit of section 37(1), in that it employed citizenship as a criteria. He alleged this was most apparent [...] "if an offence under the Act was committed by a non-citizen or permanent resident jointly with a Singapore citizen outside Singapore", as [...] "only the Singapore citizen could {{be dealt with in}} respect of that offence, and not the non-citizen or permanent resident". Hence, the appellant argued that since section 37(1) [...] "unfairly discriminates against him on the basis of citizenship", it must contravene Article 12 which provides that all persons, citizens and non-citizens <b>alike,</b> <b>are</b> equal. This rendered section 37(1) void according to Article 4 of the Constitution which provides: ...|$|E
500|$|Numismatist David Bullowa, in {{his early}} work on commemoratives, stated, [...] "the design of this issue is pleasing... the obverse and reverse <b>alike</b> <b>are</b> sharply defined, {{interesting}} and not crowded". Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his work on U.S. coins and medals, wrote that the half dollar [...] "manages to combine most of the faults found in the better designs of the 1920's and 1930's." [...] After complaining about the flat design and {{the large amount of}} lettering on both sides, Vermeule critiqued, [...] "the bust of Moses Cleaveland {{can only be described as}} commonplace, and the view of the Great Lakes, bisected by a large compass, is nothing short of incomprehensible." [...] Nevertheless, Vermeule suggested that Putnam did the best she could to squeeze the required text onto a half dollar, and might have done better with fewer words to place.|$|E
500|$|The {{movie star}} {{served as an}} {{illustration}} of hero worship in American culture, and the painted masks he dons represent his performances.

One scene repeatedly loops the same shot of a man climbing {{a flight of stairs}} with the word [...] "SUCCESS" [...] atop it, representing the actors' vain attempts to find fulfillment and advancement in his career. Film historians William Moritz and David E. James have compared this to a similar scene involving a washerwoman in the Dadaist [...] post-Cubist film Ballet Mécanique (1924). Other segments in the A Hollywood Extra are also frequently repeated, like views of the city lights, and shots of [...] "Hollywood" [...] and [...] "No Casting" [...] signs. This further exemplifies the protagonist's constant struggle to succeed in Hollywood.|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers also contrasted its {{portrayal}} of main character Honey {{as a powerful}} figure with how it also shows off her body through her nude transformation sequences. [...] Susan J. Napier, author of , distinguished the series from more pornographic anime such as Wicked City, Twin Dolls, and La Blue Girl. [...] Napier thought that the series [...] "sends mixed messages" [...] because even though Honey has great strength and heroism, her transformations are very sexual in nature. [...] She wrote that [...] "the presumably male viewer is invited in, {{to participate in the}} unclothing and clothing of her nude body, while both male and female viewer <b>alike</b> <b>are</b> allowed the vicarious participation in the ecstatic transformation process", but quickly added: [...] "Despite the regressive and voyeuristic aspects of her characterization, she is still clearly the film's hero, one worthy of admiration and emulation... in the film's several violent scenes she more than holds her own." [...] Dozier did not share that sentiment: she said [...] "Honey does have some appeal as a fighter and as someone who cares very much about the people who are important to her, but her android past and her family life aren't explored too deeply—mostly, she's too busy getting into compromising situations and fighting evil." ...|$|E
