5|$|Australia's {{prospects}} improved after Sweden was disqualified in {{the morning}} heats. Tonelli, the eldest swimmer in the quartet {{at the age of}} 23, convened the team as its de facto leader. He asked his teammates to commit to swimming their legs in a certain time; Kerry vowed to complete the backstroke in 57s, Evans the breaststroke in 63s flat, Tonelli the butterfly in 54s and Brooks promised to <b>anchor</b> <b>the</b> team in 49.8s, even though he had never gone faster than 51s. Tonelli named the foursome the Quietly Confident Quartet, and they exhibited a calm self-belief as they lined up for the race.|$|E
5|$|Born in Columbus, Ohio, Willis {{attended}} Ohio State University, {{where he}} joined the track and football teams. He {{was part of a}} Buckeyes football team that won the school's first national championship in 1942. After graduating in 1944, Willis heard about a new AAFC club in Cleveland led by his old Ohio State coach, Paul Brown. He got a tryout and made the team. With Willis as a defensive <b>anchor,</b> <b>the</b> Browns won all four AAFC championships between 1946 and 1949, when the league dissolved. The Browns were then absorbed by the NFL, where Willis continued to succeed. Cleveland won the NFL championship in 1950.|$|E

On December 18, 2005, Grossman returned to the field, leading the Bears to a 16–3 victory over the Atlanta Falcons. In the following game against the Green Bay Packers, he completed eleven of sixteen passes for 166 {{yards for a touchdown}} and one interception in a 24–17 victory. Grossman’s victory enabled the Bears to clinch a playoff berth and the National Football Conference's second playoff seed. In his first playoff game, Grossman struggled to <b>anchor</b> <b>the</b> Bears’ offense, completing 17 of 41 passes for 192 yards for one touchdown and an interception in a 29–21 loss against the Carolina Panthers.|$|E

Jennings was always fascinated with the United States and became a naturalized United States citizen in 2003.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{proximal}} series {{can be directly}} compared to the ulnare and intermedium of tetrapods. The fin was clearly weight bearing, being attached to a massive shoulder with expanded scapular and coracoid elements and attached to the body armor, large muscular scars on the ventral surface of the humerus, and highly mobile distal joints. The bones of the forefins show large muscle facets, suggesting that the fin was both muscular and {{had the ability to}} flex like a wrist joint. These wrist-like features would have helped <b>anchor</b> <b>the</b> creature to the bottom in fast moving current.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1986, the Huntington Development Corporation {{suggested}} that an off-track betting facility be constructed, however, the idea died after Governor Arch Moore vetoed an off-track betting bill that was critical to the project's success. In 1987, the Webb Companies presented {{a plan for a}} $110 million mixed-use complex called RiverCenter that would feature a 20-story office tower, an underground parking garage and a skyway to the Harris Riverfront Park. The project failed when two large tenants could not be found to <b>anchor</b> <b>the</b> project. In 1988, the city's grant to help develop the project was revoked.|$|E

5|$|In the whaleboat, Melville had, like De Long, ridden out {{the storm}} {{by means of a}} sea <b>anchor.</b> <b>The</b> boat's course was far to the south of De Long's; they finally reached land at one of the main mouths of the Lena, and were able to {{navigate}} upriver. Within a few days they encountered a native fishing camp, and by September 25 had reached the settlement of Arrhu. Chipp's cutter never reached land; overwhelmed by the storm, it presumably foundered, with the loss of all eight on board.|$|E
5|$|Noronhomys vespuccii was {{a fairly}} large rodent, larger than the black rat (Rattus rattus). A {{member of the family}} Cricetidae and {{subfamily}} Sigmodontinae, it shares several distinctive characters with Holochilus and related genera within the tribe Oryzomyini, including high-crowned molars with simplified crown features and the presence of several ridges on the skull which help <b>anchor</b> <b>the</b> chewing muscles. Although a suite of traits suggest that Holochilus is its closest relative, it is distinctive in many ways and is therefore classified in a separate genus, Noronhomys. Its close relatives, including Holochilus and Lundomys, are adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle, spending much of their time in the water, but features of the Noronhomys bones suggest that it lost its semiaquatic lifestyle after arrival at its remote island.|$|E
5|$|Since the anemone lacks a rigid skeleton, the {{contractile}} cells pull {{against the}} fluid in the gastrovascular cavity, forming a hydrostatic skeleton. The anemone stabilizes itself by flattening its pharynx which {{acts as a}} valve, keeping the gastrovascular cavity at a constant volume and making it rigid. When the longitudinal muscles relax, the pharynx opens and the cilia lining the siphonoglyphs beat, wafting water inwards and refilling the gastrovascular cavity. In general, the sea anemone inflates its body to extend its tentacles and feed, and deflates it when resting or disturbed. The inflated body {{is also used to}} <b>anchor</b> <b>the</b> animal inside a crevice, burrow or tube.|$|E

5|$|The Maratha {{redeployment}} was swifter {{and more}} efficient than Wellesley had anticipated and he immediately reacted by extending his front to deny Pohlmann the opportunity to outflank him. A battalion of pickets and the 74th Highlanders, which formed {{the right of the}} first and second lines, were ordered to move obliquely to the right. This allowed the 78th to <b>anchor</b> <b>the</b> left flank and Madras infantry battalions (the 1/10th, 1/8th, 1/4th and 2/12th) to form the centre of the British line. Wellesley's intention was to force back the Marathas from their guns and then– operating by his left to avoid the heavily defended Assaye– throw them back on the Juah and complete their destruction with his cavalry.|$|E
5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} {{spends much}} of its time climbing trees, and has adaptations to this lifestyle, {{many of which are}} shared by other woodpecker species. These include the zygodactyl arrangement of the foot, with two toes facing forward and two back, and the stiff tail feathers that are used as a prop against the trunk. In most birds the bones of the tail diminish in size towards its end, but this does not occur in woodpeckers, and the final vertebra, the pygostyle, is very large to <b>anchor</b> <b>the</b> strong tail muscles.|$|E
5|$|This is, in turn, {{surrounded}} by the viral envelope, that is composed of the lipid bilayer taken from the membrane of a human cell when the newly formed virus particle buds from the cell.

The Envelope protein, encoded by the HIV env gene, allows the virus to attach to target cells and fuse the viral envelope with the target cell membrane releasing the viral contents into the cell and initiating the infectious cycle.|$|E

5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles <b>anchor</b> <b>the</b> other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E
5|$|At 20:45, with Jason {{far behind}} in the darkness, Mars hauled up and Hood {{attempted}} to manoeuvre into an effective position from which to attack the waiting Hercule. The vagaries of the current in the Raz de Sein passage prevented Hood from handling his ship effectively however and instead he resolved on bringing Mars directly alongside and fighting broadside to broadside. At 21:15 Mars was in range and L'Héritier opened fire, Hood replying immediately. For ten minutes, the masts and rigging of Mars came under fire, with damage to the bowsprit and foremast, as Hood continued to attempt to hold his firing position against the current before pulling slightly ahead of Hercule at 21:25 and dropping <b>anchor.</b> <b>The</b> port bow anchor became entangled with the starboard anchor on Hercule and the British ship was swung violently into the French ship, {{the force of the}} collision unhinging four of the gunports on Mars.|$|E
5|$|Of the British troops, {{approximately}} 3,300 {{formed into}} a shallow horseshoe formation that {{stretched across the}} width of the Plains, the main firing line being roughly one kilometre long. Two battalions were deployed, facing north, to cover the left flank and a further two formed a reserve. In order to cover the entire plain, Wolfe was forced to array his soldiers two ranks deep, rather than the more conventional three ranks. On the left wing, regiments under Townshend exchanged fire with the militia in the scrub and captured a small collection of houses and gristmill to <b>anchor</b> <b>the</b> line. The defenders pushed the British from one house, but were repelled and, in retreat, lit several houses on fire {{to keep them out of}} enemy hands. Smoke from these fires wound up masking the British left, and may have confused Montcalm as to {{the width of the}} lines. As Wolfe's men waited for the defenders, the steady fire became intense enough that Wolfe ordered his men to lie down amid the high grass and brush.|$|E

5|$|The cloudy {{catshark}} feeds {{primarily on}} molluscs, followed by crustaceans and bony fishes. A predator of both this shark and its egg cases is the blotchy swell shark (Cephaloscyllium umbratile). A known parasite {{of this species}} is the myxosporidian Chloromyxum scyliorhinum. Reproduction is oviparous; adult females have a single functional ovary and two functional oviducts. As a prelude to mating, the male bites at the female's pectoral fin, side, and gill region. Once he has a grip, he wraps his body around hers and inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation may last between 15 seconds and 4 minutes. The claspers of the male are unusual in that each has a row of around a hundred hooks running along the inner margin. These hooks likely serve to <b>anchor</b> <b>the</b> male to the female during copulation. The female is capable of storing sperm within her nidamental gland (an organ that secretes egg cases) for many months.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaf spring}} {{industry}} has {{its presence in}} Mangalore, with Canara Workshops Ltd. and Lamina Suspension Products Ltd. in the city. The Old Mangalore Port is a fishing port located at Bunder in Mangalore, where {{a large number of}} mechanised boats <b>anchor.</b> <b>The</b> traffic at this port was 122,000 tonnes during the years 2003–04. Fishing is a traditional occupation, and the products are exported to the surrounding regions. Mangalorean firms have a major presence in the tile, beedi, coffee, and cashew nut industry, although the tile industry has declined due to concrete being preferred in modern construction. The Albuquerque tile factory in Mangalore is one of India's oldest red roof tile manufacturing factories. The Ullal suburb of Mangalore produces hosiery and coir yarns, while beedi rolling is an important source of revenue to many in the city.|$|E
5|$|The sails {{of these}} vessels {{are made of}} strips of bamboo, woven into the form of matting.

Each of these ships is worked by 1,000 men, 600 sailors and 400 marines, among whom there are archers and crossbowmen furnished with shields, and men who throw (pots of) naptha. Each great vessel is followed by three others, a 'nisfi', a 'thoulthi' and a 'roubi' (f endnote: a pinnace, a small boat fitted with a rudder, and a rowing boat). These vessels are nowhere made except in the city of Zayton (Quanzhou) in China, or at Sin-Kilan, which is the same as Sin al-Sin (Guangzhou).|$|E
