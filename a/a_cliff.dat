5|$|The Yosemite Firefall, {{in which}} the embers from a bonfire were pushed off <b>a</b> <b>cliff</b> near Glacier Point to create a {{spectacular}} effect, was ended in 1968 because it was deemed to be inconsistent with park values. The firefall was occasionally performed in the 1870s and became a nightly tradition with the founding of Camp Curry.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} methods of burial: the coffin may be laid {{in a cave}} or in a carved stone grave, or hung on <b>a</b> <b>cliff.</b> It {{contains}} any possessions that the deceased will need in the afterlife. The wealthy are often buried in a stone grave carved out of a rocky cliff. The grave is usually expensive and takes {{a few months to}} complete. In some areas, a stone cave may be found that is large enough to accommodate a whole family. A wood-carved effigy, called Tau tau, is usually placed in the cave looking out over the land. The coffin of a baby or child may be hung from ropes on <b>a</b> <b>cliff</b> face or from a tree. This hanging grave usually lasts for years, until the ropes rot and the coffin falls to the ground.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>cliffed</b> coast, {{also called}} an {{abrasion}} coast, {{is a form}} of coast where the action of marine waves has formed steep cliffs {{that may or may not}} be precipitous. It contrasts with a flat or alluvial coast.|$|R

5|$|Breeding pairs {{must have}} a {{territory}} of their own before they begin nest-building and reproduction, and thus aggressively defend a territory and its food resources. Nesting territories vary in size according to the density of food resources in the area. The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks and twigs, bound with an inner layer of roots, mud, and bark and lined with a softer material, such as deer fur. The nest is usually placed in a large tree or on <b>a</b> <b>cliff</b> ledge, or less frequently in old buildings or utility poles.|$|E
5|$|Choughs are monogamous, {{and show}} high partner and site fidelity. Both species build a bulky nest of roots, sticks and plant stems lined with grass, fine twiglets or hair. It is {{constructed}} on a ledge, {{in a cave}} or similar fissure in <b>a</b> <b>cliff</b> face, or in man-made locations like abandoned buildings, quarries or dams. Red-billed will also sometimes use occupied buildings such as Mongolian monasteries. The choughs are not colonial, although in suitable habitat several pairs may nest in close proximity.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, three fossilized Tiktaalik skeletons were {{discovered}} in rock formed from late Devonian river sediments on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, in northern Canada. Estimated ages reported at 375 MYA, 379 MYA, and 383 MYA. At {{the time of the}} species' existence, Ellesmere Island was part of the continent Laurentia (modern eastern North America and Greenland), which was centered on the equator and had a warm climate. When discovered, one of the skulls was found sticking out of <b>a</b> <b>cliff.</b> Upon further inspection, the fossil was found to be in excellent condition for a 375-million-year-old specimen.|$|E

5|$|Je Me Souviens was {{published}} in 1910, after Vivien's death. That same year, Barney published Actes et Entr'actes (Acts and Interludes), {{a collection of short}} plays and poems. One of the plays was Equivoque (Ambiguity), a revisionist version on the legend of Sappho's death: Instead of throwing herself off <b>a</b> <b>cliff</b> for the love of Phaon the sailor, she does so out of grief that Phaon is marrying the woman she loves.

5|$|More recently, preservationists persuaded Congress to {{designate}} , or about 89% of the park, as the Yosemite Wilderness—a highly protected wilderness area. The Park Service has reduced artificial inducements {{to visit the}} park, such as the Firefall, in which red-hot embers were pushed off <b>a</b> <b>cliff</b> near Glacier Point at night. Traffic congestion in Yosemite Valley {{during the summer months}} has become a concern. Two electric buses commenced service in September 1995. The buses are quiet and do not emit pollutants. Eventually, all the buses in Yosemite will be electric.|$|E
