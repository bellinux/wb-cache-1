This target population is heterogeneous and their needs change over time, which is a great challenge in terms of customers’ satisfaction, operational manufacturing performance, and financial results. The design model proposed is composed of design approach, containing the design principles that guide the process; and the design methodology (stages and their activities). This process was applied in a case study in the context of walking aids such as canes, crutches and walking frames was performed. This case brings insights about how to offer products variety to respond to different users in a suitable manufacturing environment...|$|E
40|$|Assistive driving {{was known}} to be the {{important}} aspect in addressing the mobility limitation, particularly for a person with disabilities. <b>Assistive</b> <b>product</b> modification for vehicle driving, ranging from hand control, secondary control, foot control, and also the wheelchair assisted vehicle developed towards addressing the driving limitation differences according to a person types of disabilities. A pilot survey was conducted to 50 Malaysia independent drivers in Kuala Lumpur. The components evaluated during the survey include, types of modification used, aspects influencing the vehicle modification decision, problem occurrence when in use, as well as to understand the preferential decision differences. The Likert scale (1 to 5) will be used as the rate score given by the responses for each question within the component in the survey. The survey was used as the approach to gather the responses from the respondent. From the survey, it was discovered that aspect such as the disability condition, safer driving, and information availability are several major factors influencing the driver to make modification for independent driving purposes. The major factors were also discovered to influence the modification origin as preferences for driving assistance. The certain least important factors such as the involved body part movement limitation and price range must not be ignored as they also contribute to the improvement for the independent disabled driving...|$|E
40|$|The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) {{have placed}} great {{emphasis}} {{on the need for}} much greater social inclusion, and on making deliberate efforts to reach marginalized groups. People with disabilities are often marginalized through their lack of access to a range of services and opportunities. <b>Assistive</b> <b>products</b> can help people overcome impairments and barriers enabling them to be active, participating and productive members of society. <b>Assistive</b> <b>products</b> are vital for people with disabilities, frailty and chronic illnesses; and for those with mental health problems, and gradual cognitive and physical decline characteristic of aging populations. This paper illustrates how the achievement of each of the 17 SDGs can be facilitated by the use of <b>assistive</b> <b>products.</b> Without promoting the availability of <b>assistive</b> <b>products</b> the SDGs cannot be achieved equitably.

40|$|Purpose: The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) {{is working}} on {{accessibility}} of products to support people with cognitive impairment. Working Group 10, within the technical committee 173 (<b>assistive</b> <b>products</b> for persons with disability) was formed in 2014 to draft standards for <b>assistive</b> <b>products</b> that support people with cognitive impairment. Method: This article explains the scope and purpose of the working group and the context for its formation, and describes the plans and process for drafting and publishing new international standards. Results: The proposed suite of standards is presented, with examples from a draft standard on daily time management. It draws on international research evidence for the effectiveness of <b>assistive</b> <b>products</b> designed to support time management in people with cognitive impairment. Examples of <b>assistive</b> <b>products</b> and their key features are provided based on domains of time as defined in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth (ICF-CY). Conclusions: The proposed standards will provide design recommendations for features and functions that increase the accessibility of products used by people with cognitive impairment. They are intended {{to be used by}} designers, manufactures, educators and services providers, to facilitate their commitment to inclusion and demonstrate their willingness to work with accessibility regulation. Implications for Rehabilitation New standards based on universal design (UD) principles can guide the design of more user-friendly <b>assistive</b> <b>products</b> for people with cognitive impairment. Greater usability of <b>assistive</b> <b>products,</b> whether mainstream or specially-designed, {{will make it easier for}} practitioners to find and introduce assistive solutions to individuals with cognitive impairment.

The aim was to verify the applicability of design strategies to increase the users' perceived value via the offer of controlled levels customization. For that, lean principle of standardization and the taxonomy of customization levels from the mass customization approaches guided this study. These concepts focused the research into design patterns identification, allowing the use of combinatorial modularization. The efforts consisted in a technologic research made in Abledata and Assisdata AT databases, which resulted in a selection of 200 walking aids and accessories. After, their features were analyzed, with special attention to the products architecture. The investigation concluded that <b>assistive</b> <b>products</b> for walking are able to incorporate high levels of product customization.

40|$|Introduction A {{qualitative}} study {{was carried out}} to understand how people with a slow progressive adult type neuromuscular disease (NMD) perceive employment participation. Methods 16 paid employed persons with NMD were interviewed in open, in-depth interviews. Data were analyzed using the constant comparison method. Results Four themes were identified in the analyses: (1) Experiences regarding the meaning of work; (2) Solving problems oneself; (3) Reaching a turning point; and (4) Taking into account environmental aspects. Persons with NMD highlighted benefits of staying at {{work as well as}} the tension they felt how to shape decisions to handle progressive physical hindrances in job retention. This study shows how participants at work with NMD were challenged to keep up appearances at work and at home, the tension felt around when and if to disclose, the effect of their condition on colleagues and work reorganisation challenges. Participants experienced that disclosure did not always make things better. With increasing disability participants' focus shifted from the importance of <b>assistive</b> <b>products</b> towards considerate colleague, in particular superior's willingness in supporting job retention. Conclusions Implications for health professionals might include awareness of the significant impact of changes in physical condition on employment. Timely communication and if appropriate referral to a health or occupational professional may empower employees with NMD to handle employment issues at a for themselves appropriate way. <b>Assistive</b> <b>products</b> and a supportive superior might enhance employment participation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAfter being {{a subject}} of psychological, social and even anthropological studies for many years, the nature of {{emotions}} and their measurement has become a popular target for research in recent times, in fields such as design and advertising. The consumer world is starting {{to realize that the}} human is by nature an emotional being, and {{that it is important to}} start addressing this in many different levels in order to for example improve sales, develop better and more personal products and in general to evaluate the effect that all these products and services may have in our life. Basically, emotion is an essential key for developing a product that brings happiness to people. This study investigated the Kansei needs of the Japanese elderly for personal <b>assistive</b> <b>products</b> relating to mobility with emotional design approaches. In Japan, the proportion of people older than 80 years is growing rapidly. To guarantee the sustainability of health and social care systems while enhancing quality of life, it is important to find ways to promote the functional capacity of older people. Mobility is a key issue in maintaining independence in old age. Mobility refers to a person's ability to move independently and safely from one place to another. In the market, there are various types of personal <b>assistive</b> <b>products.</b> This study evaluated the present design of a walking stick from the older people's points of views. Two new emotional evaluation methods were used to carry out this study; Kansei sheets and read body language (RBL) sheet. The present study identified the problems of the walking stick design. Furthermore, it had proved the efficiency of the new evaluation methods to capture older people's experiences and emotions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{critical}} {{component in the}} development of new products is the inclusion of input from future users. This input is invaluable in defining and understanding the technical/functional needs that the product must fulfill. This input also serves as a guide to less tangible, but often as important, attributes such as satisfaction, acceptability or aesthetics. Along with the functional needs, these {{play an important role in}} the ultimate success of a product. This is particularly true in the case of <b>assistive</b> <b>products</b> where functionality is critical but the treatment of non-functional needs can play a large role in a device's acceptability, the stigma associated with it and reducing rates of abandonment. This paper will review the product development challenges faced by producers of <b>assistive</b> technology <b>products.</b> It will then describe results from two early studies which may provide new approaches to meeting these challenges. The first is an investigation of the accuracy of user input when it is provided based on different representations of a design (such as sketches, renderings or models) that are commonly available at various stages of the design process. A better understanding of this input will allow designers to focus more on the components of it that are more likely to accurately represent users’ opinion of a finished product. The second is an investigation into the use of augmented reality to facilitate usability testing of design concepts...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{literature}} review examines {{the body of}} knowledge concerning the use of respite services and <b>assistive</b> <b>products</b> and technology, child and family characteristics, and parental well-being among families with a daughter with Rett syndrome or with a child with another developmental disability. Method: Literature published in the time period 1983 - 2009 was searched. Studies were included in this review if they reported use of respite services or <b>assistive</b> <b>products</b> and technology among families with a daughter with Rett syndrome or with a child with another developmental disability. Child and family characteristics and parental well-being were also considered. Results and conclusions: Respite services {{have the potential to}} decrease parental stress and therefore may provide an important resource for families with a child with a disability. Additionally a number of characteristics including the age and clinical severity of a child with a disability and where their family lives may impact on the use of supportive resources. However there is a clear need for research to examine the relationships between child and family characteristics, the use of supportive resources and parental well-being in families with Rett syndrome. Purpose: To assess factors that could influence use of equipment and respite services among families with a daughter with Rett syndrome and to examine the relationships between the use of these resources and the health of female caregivers. Method: Parent questionnaire data from 2004 and 2006 in the population-based Australian Rett Syndrome Database was the source of data. Logistic regression was used to analyse relationships between child factors (age, mobility, clinical severity and behaviour), family factors (accessibility and socioeconomic factors) and the use of equipment and respite services in 2004.

40|$|The {{political}} line in Swedish disability policy advocates {{the use of}} generalized {{solutions in}} order to fit potential needs of the largest possible group of people and, where needed, special solutions to bridge the remaining gap between the generalized level of accessibility and additional individual needs. This {{is referred to as}} the disability perspective (DP). The DP has embraced two tracks: one that pertains to generalized solutions that promote an overall high level of accessibility and usability, and another one that pertains to different types of individual support for people with disabilities. The present study is a self-reflective inquiry on key issues for the development of future disability policies. Five experts entered a discussion about the pros and cons concerning the DP. This confirmed or refuted assumptions, dilemmas, themes as well as reoccurring patterns in the political viva voce procedure that has formed the contemporary disability policy.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Assistive technologies (AT) are the products provided to elderly and disabled people {{to enable them to}} live more independently. Despite their ability to help maintain independence and prevent injury, the literature discussed within this thesis indicates that assistive technologies are not meeting the needs of the end-user. In response, research has been undertaken with the following objectives: 1. To identify how and why <b>assistive</b> technology <b>products</b> are failing to satisfy the customer. 2. To establish if a design tool can be created that overcomes the issues identified in the inductive research and which enables companies to design customer-satisfying <b>assistive</b> technology <b>products.</b> In progressing these objectives, two phases of research were planned. The first comprised four parallel studies (focus groups, case studies, questionnaires and a literature study), which together examined the state of AT products and the product-development activities of AT manufacturers. The second phase of research examined four customer-focused product design methods for their suitability for utilisation by small companies within the AT sector. On finding that no method in its entirety was suitable, a customer-focused design tool for small AT companies was developed. The resulting tool comprises eight elements for application in the initial stages of the product development process.
