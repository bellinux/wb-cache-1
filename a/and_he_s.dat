40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Harris expansion method {{is applied to}} the elastic s-wave scattering of low energy electrons from hydrogen atoms and singly ionized helium atoms. The trial wave functions are Hylleraas functions of 22, 34, 50 and 70 parameters. It is found that reasonably accurate values of e-H phase shifts can be calculated but that e-He phase shifts are substantially less reliable. It is shown that the Harris method gives an accurate depiction of the location, but not the width, of the scattering resonances. Singlet and triplet s-wave phase shifts for e-H and e-He scattering are compared with the results of other calculations and H <b>and</b> <b>He</b> <b>S</b> state energy levels including the auto-ionizing levels are presented and compared with other calculations and with experiment. It is tentatively concluded that the Harris method does not work on systems whose long range potential is of the Coulomb type. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E

In 1998, Bradford D.

No subspecies of S. ater are currently recognized. [...] Based primarily on the extensive use of the name S. obesus, a petition to give that name precedence over that of S. ater was submitted to the ICZN. [...] However, this reasoning was dubious and the priority of S. ater was maintained. [...] In 2004, ICZN ruled that the name Sauromalus ater was first described by zoologist Auguste Duméril in 1856, thus had precedence over the name Sauromalus obesus which was not named until 1858 by Baird.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the process of {{molecular}} ions formation in interstellar space, which {{played an important role in}} the early Universe. A large part of the work focuses on the theoretical study of quantum dynamics of the process of radiative association pre- dominantly induced by dipole transitions. The effect of quadrupole transitions on the radiative association have also been taken into account, which has been studied for the first time. Furthermore, spectroscopic characteristics of rovibronic transitions of selected di- atomic ions for the study of cosmological variability of fundamental constants were determined. The main outcomes of the thesis include the characterization of depopulation of metastable levels <b>He</b> (23 <b>S)</b> <b>and</b> <b>He</b> (21 <b>S)</b> due to radiative collisions with hydrogen, helium and lithium ions, i. e. He + A+ → HeA+ + hν. Within the study quantum dynamics calculations were carried out using a fully quan- tal approach. Studied spontaneous and stimulated processes on a specific spin manifold were characterized by energy-dependent cross sections and temperature-dependent rate coefficients. Compared to previous published works by other authors highly excited electronic states are considered. The results showed that a) the spontaneous radiative association contributes significantly to the [...] ...|$|R
