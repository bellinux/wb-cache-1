40|$|For {{the upper}} {{stage of the}} future version of the Ariane 5, the A 5 ME, it is {{important}} to know the motion of the liquids inside it. One essential motion to understand is the sloshing process. Each spacecraft maneuver leads not only to desired accelerations, there are also accelerations, introduced within the liquids on-board the spacecraft. Due to these forces the liquids are able to start sloshing inside the propellant tanks. The natural damping ratio of sloshing inside the propellant tanks is then an important aspect to understand. Considering that sloshing is feasible at all mission phases, the behavior of the propellant for different fill levels is interesting. Furthermore the sloshing behavior with <b>anti-sloshing</b> devices could be investigated. With the knowledge of the sloshing behavior for each mission phase, it would be possible to optimize maneuvers, so that there are fewer disturbances for the propellant’s free surface and thus fewer self-induced instabilities. In order to further the understanding of this topic DLR Bremen provides, in cooperation with EuroCryospace, tests for sloshing with different fill levels...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{analysis}} {{process for the}} linear coupled vibration of a circular container and its inner liquid often uses FEM method. An equation set which contained the fluid node pressure and the structure node displacement was formed, based on these equations, in this paper, a new equation set which has a smaller dimension and symmetrical form is obtained by the method of model reduction and coordinate symmetrization. By solving the boundary value problems of equivalent Laplace formulas, the additional masses matrix, additional stiffness matrix and coupling matrix which have effect from fluid to structure are gained. The example of the modal analysis for liquid container demonstrates that this method {{presented in this paper}} can get the modal frequency accurately and rapidly in fluid-structure coupled vibration system and other similar engineering realm. In the fluid-structure coupled vibration analysis realm, sloshing phenomenon {{is one of the major}} concerns. Considering the large dimension of the fluid’s degree of freedom, a great many analysis methods have been discussed in the relevant papers. Sloshing in a tank without any <b>anti-sloshing</b> device could be determined theoretically in some regulation tank [1]. And most of th...|$|E
40|$|The slosh {{dynamics}} of propellant tanks {{can be represented}} by an equivalent mass-pendulum-dashpot mechanical model. The parameters of this equivalent model, identified as slosh mechanical model parameters, are slosh frequency, slosh mass, and pendulum hinge point location. They {{can be obtained by}} both analysis and testing for discrete fill levels. <b>Anti-slosh</b> baffles are usually needed in propellant tanks to control the movement of the fluid inside the tank. Lateral slosh testing, involving both random excitation testing and free-decay testing, are performed to validate the slosh mechanical model parameters and the damping added to the fluid by the <b>anti-slosh</b> baffles. Traditional modal analysis procedures were used to extract the parameters from the experimental data. Test setup of sub-scale tanks will be described. A comparison between experimental results and analysis will be presented...|$|R
5|$|Apollo 11 {{landed with}} less fuel than other missions, and the astronauts {{encountered}} a premature low fuel warning. This was later {{found to be}} the result of greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra <b>anti-slosh</b> baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.|$|R
50|$|Before final {{assembly}} wooden <b>anti-slosh</b> baffles were installed, {{pipes and fittings}} were attached and the interiors coated with fuel-resistant lacquer and the three pieces were bonded together in press. Once the tank had cured, it was pressure tested to 6 PSI and passing tanks were given two coats of cellulose dope followed by two coats of aluminium paint. (British drop tanks can be distinguished from outwardly similar metal tanks by colour, paper tanks were silver in appearance, while metal tanks were grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the AS-203 flight was to {{investigate}} the effects of weightlessness on the liquid hydrogen fuel in the S-IVB-200 second-stage tank. The lunar missions would use {{a modified version of the}} S-IVB-200, the S-IVB-500, as the third stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. This called for the stage to fire briefly to put the spacecraft into a parking Earth orbit, before restarting the engine for flight to the Moon. In order to design this capability, engineers needed to verify that the <b>anti-slosh</b> measures designed to control the hydrogen's location in the tank were adequate, and that the fuel lines and engines could be kept at the proper temperatures to allow engine restart.|$|R
40|$|Liquid {{propellant}} slosh {{is often}} {{a concern for the}} controllability of flight vehicles. <b>Anti-slosh</b> devices are traditionally included in propellant tank designs to limit the amount of sloshing allowed during flight. These devices and any necessary supports can be quite heavy to meet various structural requirements. Some of the burden on <b>anti-slosh</b> devices can be relieved by exploiting the nonlinear behavior of slosh waves in bare smooth wall tanks. A nonlinear regime slosh model for bare spherical tanks was developed through a joint analytical and experimental effort by NASA/MSFC. The developed slosh model accounts for the large damping inherent in nonlinear slosh waves which is more accurate and drives conservatism from vehicle stability analyses that use traditional bare tank slosh models. A more accurate slosh model will result in more realistic predicted slosh forces during flight reducing or removing the need for active controls during a maneuver or baffles in the tank design. Lower control gains and smaller or fewer tank baffles can reduce cost and system complexity while increasing vehicle performance. Both Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation and slosh testing of three different spherical tank geometries were performed to develop the proposed slosh model. Several important findings were made during this effort in addition to determining the parameters to the nonlinear regime slosh model. The linear regime slosh damping trend for spherical tanks reported in NASA SP- 106 was shown to be inaccurate for certain regions of a tank. Additionally, transition to the nonlinear regime for spherical tanks was only found to occur at very large wave amplitudes in the lower hemisphere and was a strong function of the propellant fill level in the upper hemisphere. The nonlinear regime damping trend was also found to be a function of the propellant fill level...|$|R
50|$|The RF model saw {{improved}} cooling through fairing redesigns {{in relation}} to the RE, as well as the addition of a double oil sump system, complete with <b>anti-slosh</b> plate mounted in the oil pan (compared to the single pump system in use on the RE model. This was done in order to combat oil starvation during cornering, as well as ensure that the cams and heads of the motor were receiving adequate lubrication. The RE models initially had trouble with camshaft wear. The addition of the second oil pump as well as a redesign of the camshaft clamps was done in order to improve the situation. The RF model also got a redesigned oil pan with taps for an oil cooler and the respective lines, in order to help with the high temperatures seen in the oiling system.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This study {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} effectiveness of different designs of baffles, including the conventional, partial and oblique, in limiting the manoeuvre-induced transient as well as steady-state fluid slosh forces and moments in a partly-filled tank truck. The effect of an alternating arrangement of partial baffles is also explored. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model of a partly-filled tank is developed to study the relative <b>anti-slosh</b> properties of different baffles designs and layouts under combined idealized longitudinal and lateral acceleration fields and different cargo loads. The analyses are also performed for a cleanbore tank, which is validated using the widely-used quasi-static slosh model. The {{results suggest that the}} conventional transverse baffles offer important resistance to fluid slosh under braking manoeuvres, while the obliquely placed baffles could help limit the longitudinal as well as lateral fluid slosh under combined lateral and longitudinal acceleration excitations...|$|R
50|$|Liquid {{sloshing}} strongly {{influences the}} directional dynamics and safety performance of highway tank vehicles {{in a highly}} adverse manner. Hydrodynamic forces and moments arising from liquid cargo oscillations in the tank under steering and/or braking maneuvers reduce the stability limit and controllability of partially-filled tank vehicles. <b>Anti-slosh</b> devices such as baffles are widely used in order to limit the adverse liquid slosh effect on directional performance and stability of the tank vehicles. Since most of the time, tankers are carrying dangerous liquid contents such as ammonia, gasoline and fuel oils; therefore stability of partially-filled liquid cargo vehicles is very important. Optimizations and sloshing reduction techniques in fuel tanks such as elliptical tank, rectangular, modified oval and generic tank shape have been performed in different filling levels using numerical, analytical and analogical analyses. Most of these studies concentrate on effects of baffles on sloshing while the influence of cross-section is completely ignored.|$|R
50|$|Investigators {{concluded}} that the disaster {{was due to the}} above-mentioned configuration change on the Atlas C, in addition to several weight-saving modifications unique to Missile 9C. When the Atlas was assembled at Convair, workmen attached a helium vent line to a port {{near the bottom of the}} RP-1 tank, below the <b>anti-slosh</b> baffles. On the Atlas B missiles, the vernier helium tank was mounted in a higher location resulting in a different fuel tank attachment point above the baffles. Helium pressure gas from the vernier propellant tanks leaked into the sustainer RP-1 turbopump, leading to cavitation which caused propellant unloading, pump overspeed, and rupture of the propellant lines. This then caused the fire that led to vehicle destruction. It was not clear whether the fire had been started by rupture of a LOX duct due to sudden pressure change from the helium venting or rubbing of the turbopump blades against the metal casing due to overspeed caused by the pump running without propellant in it. The accident was ultimately ruled to be the result of poor engineering judgement in attaching the vernier helium vent line to the bottom of the RP-1 tank.|$|R
40|$|Polar Satellites Launch Vehicle (PSLV) is {{the work}} horse of ISRO. It is used to launch 1000 kg {{satellites}} in polar orbits and upto 1600 kg satellites in low earth orbits. PSLV is a 4 stage vehicle weighing 315 tonnes. It uses liquid propulsion for second and fourth stages. The fourth stage propulsion tank {{is made up of}} Titanium Alloy (Ti 6 Al 4 V) (1335 mm dia). The configuration of tank is monocoque, with a common bulkhead to separate the fuel and oxidiser. The top compartment is used for fuel and bottom compartment is filled with oxidiser. <b>Anti-slosh</b> baffles (Ring Baffles) are used in both compartments to suppress slosh. Sloshing is a common phenomenon in partially filled liquid container. The rocket motor cases, filled with liquid propellants are left with an internal ullage volume (free volume) for the pressuring gas to stabilise. This creates a free surface of liquid. Sloshing is defined as the oscillation of the free surface of a liquid in a partially filled container due to external disturbances. Baffles are essentially ?plates? fixed inside the container to arrest sloshing. The slosh waves, during the causes of travel, hits the plates breaks and dies out. This reduces the slosh forces on the walls of container. Presently the ring baffles are supported from top flange of tank for launching satellites up to 1200 kg. For this propellant loading is upto 2. 5 t. Now a PS 4 stage is reconfigured with 0. 8 t loading to launch 500 kg satellites. In this tank the liquid levels are less. Hence ring baffles are supported from bottom flange of tank to reduce the total mass of the baffle system. So in this paper Structural design, Finite Element analysis and Modal Analysis are carried out...|$|R
40|$|Liquid cargo {{contained}} in a partly-filled tank is known to experience the sloshing movement when subjected to manoeuvre-induced disturbances. Large amplitude slosh can be induced within a partly-filled road tank vehicle under mild to severe directional manoeuvres, which could severely degrade the vehicle stability and directional control limits. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics slosh model is implemented for the partly-filled cleanbore and baffled tanks {{on the basis of}} the Navier-Stokes equations incorporating the VOF technique. A comprehensive experimental study is conducted to analyze the fluid slosh within a scale model tank with and without the baffles under continuous as well as single-cycle sinusoidal lateral and longitudinal acceleration excitations. The three-dimensional fluid slosh responses are further investigated for full scale baffled and unbaffled vehicle tanks using the validated fluid slosh model. The fluid slosh characteristics are analyzed under different fill volumes corresponding to a constant load and subjected to excitations representing steady-turning, straight-line braking, braking-in-turn and path change maneuvers. The fluid slosh analyses are also carried out to explore the <b>anti-slosh</b> effectiveness of baffles and to evaluate the effects of baffle design factors, such as equalizer and the orifice size. The influences of transient fluid slosh on the tank vehicle stability and responses are studied by incorporating the fluid slosh model to in-plane vehicle models. The two-dimensional roll-plane slosh models of partly-filled tanks of different cross-sections are integrated with the roll moment equilibrium of an articulated vehicle to derive the vehicle roll stability limits. The roll stability analyses are performed for circular and "Reuleaux triangular" tanks under the conditions of constant and variable cargo loads. The results attained are compared with the quasi-static solutions to demonstrate the role of transient slosh loads on the roll stability limits. The three-dimensional slosh model of a partly-filled tank is also integrated into a 7 -DOF pitch plane model of a tridem truck to analyze its straight-line braking characteristics in the presence of fluid slosh. The straight-line braking responses of the coupled tank-vehicle model with and without baffles are analyzed under different fill volumes but constant load for different magnitudes of braking treadle pressure and road surface adhesion limit...|$|R
40|$|The liquid motion {{within a}} partly-filled tank has been {{associated}} with reduced overturning limits and braking performance of highway tank trucks. The magnitude of maneuver-induced fluid slosh in a partly-filled tank is strongly dependent upon baffles geometry and baffles layout, apart from many other factors. The conventional lateral baffles can effectively suppress longitudinal fluid slosh induced by a braking or acceleration maneuvers, while their effect on lateral slosh in the roll plane is negligible. Both the overturning limits and braking properties of a partly-filled tank truck could be enhanced through alternate baffles geometry and layout. This dissertation research focuses on the analysis of fluid slosh behavior in a partly-filled tank coupled with different designs of anti slosh baffles. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics slosh model is developed for the partly-filled cleanbore, and different designs and layouts of baffled tanks {{on the basis of the}} Navier-Stokes equations incorporating the VOF technique. The slosh models are formulated to investigate steady-state as well as transient forces and moments imposed on the container under longitudinal, lateral and combined longitudinal and lateral acceleration fields. A quasi-static model of the partly-filled cleanbore tank is also formulated to examine validity of the dynamic fluid slosh model in terms of steady-state responses. The fluid slosh characteristics are analyzed under different fill volumes corresponding to varying cargo load and subjected to external excitations representing steady-turning, straight-line braking and braking-in-turn maneuvers. The fluid slosh analyses are also carried out to explore the <b>anti-slosh</b> effectiveness of baffles and to evaluate the effects of baffles design factors, such as baffle curvature, orifice size and shape of the orifice. Alternate design concepts and orientations of baffles are also explored with goals of limiting both the longitudinal and lateral slosh. Concepts in obliquely placed baffle, partial baffles, and partial baffles arranged in an alternating pattern are proposed and analyzed for their effectiveness in limiting the fluid slosh. The results of the study suggest that obliquely placed baffles could help to limit lateral as well as longitudinal fluid slosh under lateral as well as combined lateral and longitudinal acceleration excitations...|$|R
