5|$|As {{the case}} of Ælfwald shows, while the written sources for later Northumbria are few and often written down centuries after the events they describe, archaeological {{evidence}} from coinage is independent of the surviving annals. Anglo-Saxon coins usually named the king on whose orders they were issued and sometimes named the mint where they were struck—Northumbrian coinage names York as the place of issue—and the moneyer who produced them. Their weight and silver content can be compared with other reigns, providing <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prevailing economic conditions, and the style and size may also throw light on cultural influences when the coins are {{compared with those of}} neighbouring kingdoms and with other forms of art. The evidence of Northumbrian coinage is particularly valuable in the ninth century, when contemporary written evidence all but disappears.|$|E
5|$|Meckiff {{missed the}} Third Test in Durban {{and spent a}} month on the sidelines, before {{returning}} against a combined team from Orange Free State and Border {{at the end of}} January. He took 6/29 in the first innings, his best return of the tour, and earned a recall for the final two Tests of the five-match series. He was not as effective as he was on debut, taking two and one wickets for the matches respectively, and scoring 26 runs in his only innings of the Fourth Test. Overall, the Victorian paceman had made a steady start to his international career, with 11 Test wickets at an average of 32.09, and 56 runs at 18.66. In the entire tour, he took 33 first-class wickets at 23.09. However, there was <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> controversy that was to end his career six years later. A year after the series, the South African Test umpire Bill Marais said he was prepared to no-ball Meckiff and his team-mate Jim Burke for throwing. There were reports that Craig had been tipped off about Marais's intentions and therefore operated the two bowlers exclusively from the end at which Marais was not officiating.|$|E

5|$|In the 1340s Ivan Sratsimir rose in {{prominence}} {{because he}} was married and already had children, while his eldest brother Michael Asen and his wife did not produce children for ten years. In 1352 Ivan Alexander introduced the title junior emperor {{in order to secure}} the smooth and secure transition of the throne and Ivan Sratsimir became known by that title. In the end of 1347 or in the beginning of 1348, however, Ivan Alexander divorced with his first wife and sent her to a monastery so he could marry the Jew Sarah-Theodora. That event spoiled the relations between Ivan Sratsimir and his father and the conflict deepened after the birth of Ivan Shishman to Ivan Alexander and Sarah-Theodora in 1350/1351. The conflict climaxed in 1355–1356 when the undisputed heir to the throne, Michael Asen IV, perished in battle against the Ottomans. According to the Majorat system, Ivan Sratsimir should have come next in the succession line but since Ivan Shishman was born in the purple, i.e. after his father was crowned, Ivan Alexander and Sarah-Theodora declared Ivan Shishman successor to the throne. <b>A</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feud between father and son {{is the fact that the}} image of Ivan Sratsimir was not included in the Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander where the whole imperial family was pictured, including Ivan Alexander's son-in-law. That could mean either that Ivan Sratsimir was disinherited and proclaimed himself emperor in Vidin or that he was denied the title junior emperor and given the rule of Vidin as a compensation.|$|E

25|$|Following preparatory school Ross boarded at Haileybury where, {{being both}} small {{for his age}} and a latecomer to his year, he {{initially}} suffered greatly from bullying — to his intense relief the bully {{was killed in a}} vacation cycling accident — but his stock quickly rose when he revealed a talent which matched his passion for cricket. With <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> debonair style that was to characterise his life, he avoided participation in the OTC and all study of mathematics and science, instead enjoying art, French poetry and racquet sports. As a senior boy he was caned for making an unlicensed visit to Wimbledon; it was his misfortune that he figured, smoking a cigarette, in a photograph of spectators carried in his headmaster's newspaper the following morning.|$|E
25|$|Apollonius of Rhodes {{was born}} about 295 BC. He is best remembered for his epic poem The Argonautica, about Jason and his shipmates, the Argonauts, {{in search of}} the Golden Fleece. Apollonius studied under Callimachus, with whom he later quarreled. He also served as {{librarian}} at Alexandria for about 13 years. Apart from the Argonautica, he wrote poems on the foundation of cities {{as well as a number}} of epigrams. The Roman poet Virgil was strongly influenced by the Argonautica in writing his Aeneid. Lesser 3rd-century poets include Aratus of Soli and Herodas. Aratus wrote the Phaenomena, a poetic version of a treatise on the stars by Eudoxus of Cnidus, who had lived in the 4th century. Herodas wrote mimes reminiscent of those of Theocritus. His works give <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> popular entertainment of the times. Mime and pantomime were a major form of entertainment during the early Roman Empire.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Tooms enters Scully's home was {{initially}} filmed in Hutchison's absence. The crew shot his entrance later, using a larger blue screen set. These shots were digitally merged so that Tooms would appear to emerge from a much smaller hatch than was filmed. The effect was kept to a minimum; Hutchison's footage was not [...] "squeezed" [...] too much, as both Carter and visual effects supervisor Mat Beck have stated their belief that [...] "less is more: just <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supernatural {{is all that is}} required".|$|E

25|$|Moreton, however, is not unconcerned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{situation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decent {{poor people}} and vagrants, so {{he suggests that}} barracks or barns should be built at convenient ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town, where all vagrants should be obliged to render themselves at a stated hour, where they should have clean straw allowed them, and be kept orderly and out of harm's way; they may be let loose if they have apparent means of honest livelihood, otherwise they {{should be sent to}} <b>the</b> workhouse <b>of</b> their respective parish, or to a general workhouse, of which there is great need; and of which more hereafter. This proposition can be valued as <b>an</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eighteenth-century ambivalent frame of mind towards these individuals. On one hand restrictions and penalties were vigorously demanded by the English society. On the other hand, not only some kinds of begging activities were allowed but, common people strongly felt a social and religious obligation to give something or to answer a plea.|$|R

500|$|Director {{and film}} critic Sudhish Kamath called Enthiran [...] "a superhero film, a sci-fi adventure, a {{triangular}} love story with <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ramayana", while remarking that Enthiran similarities to The Terminator (1984) were [...] "more than obvious. Not just visually– {{where we see}} the Superstar with one human eye and one scarred metallic eye but also intentionally spelt out when the bad robot announces that he has created Terminators." [...] Kamath compared two of the film's robots to C-3PO and R2-D2, droids from the Star Wars film series, which was referenced in Enthiran when Vaseegaran refers {{to one of his}} creations as [...] "R2".|$|E
500|$|Bathory {{described}} Five Finger Death Punch as [...] "a straight-up {{heavy metal}} band {{with a hint}} of thrash metal — maybe <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Euro stuff in there" [...] and then said, [...] "that's pretty much what we are". Spencer described Five Finger Death Punch as [...] "kind of like stepping on a garden rake while looking at a supermodel. Blissful yet fucking devastating". He then said, [...] "We have an energy and a rhythmical style that's different than what's happening out there. We have songs that grab you and stay with you and rip your face off. Hooks, balls, melodies and energy — that's us".|$|E

Cook wrote that if any such continent existed it would be [...] "a country doomed by nature", and that [...] "no man will venture further than I have done, and the land to the South will never be explored". He concluded: [...] "Should the impossible be achieved and the land attained, it would be wholly useless and of no benefit to the discoverer or his nation".|$|E

500|$|Disney {{has also}} been accused of racism because some of his {{productions}} released between the 1930s and 1950s contain racially insensitive materials. The feature film Song of the South was criticized by contemporary film critics, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and others for its perpetuation of black stereotypes, but Disney later campaigned successfully for an Honorary Academy Award for its star, James Baskett, the first black actor so honored. Gabler argues that [...] "Walt Disney was no racist. He never, either publicly or privately, made disparaging remarks about blacks or asserted white superiority. Like most white Americans of his generation, however, he was racially insensitive." [...] Floyd Norman, the studio's first black animator who worked closely with Disney during the 1950s and 1960s, said, [...] "Not once did I observe <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> racist behavior Walt Disney was often accused of after his death. His treatment of peopleand by this I mean all peoplecan only be called exemplary." ...|$|E
500|$|Specifically, Enough Said {{was praised}} for its {{commitment}} to realism, both in the way Holofcener's characters converse and in the themes the film addresses. In a review for The New York Times, A. O. Scott claimed that [...] "Line for line, scene for scene, {{it is one of}} the best-written American film comedies in recent memory." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt that Enough Said demonstrated [...] "Holofcener's gift for portraying life as it is lived", while David Denby, writing for The New Yorker, wrote that it [...] "approaches novelistic richness". In The New York Times Book Review, Francine Prose praised Holofcener for having written characters [...] "with sufficient depth and wisdom that ... the actors never seem to be movie stars impersonating people. Rather, they disappear into the vulnerable and self-doubting characters they play without <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preening vanity that so often causes cinematic performances to seem forced and shallow." ...|$|E
500|$|During Madonna's {{induction}} at the 2008 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, [...] "Burning Up" [...] {{was performed}} by Iggy Pop and the punk rock band The Stooges, along with [...] "Ray of Light".

Singer Britney Spears covered [...] "Burning Up" [...] in 2011 during select shows, for her Femme Fatale Tour. The performance featured her straddling a giant, glittering guitar, ten feet high and twice as long. However, Barry Walters from Rolling Stone felt that the cover she sang on the tour, [...] "lacked Madge's [...] authority." [...] Studio recording of the cover, described by Sarah Maloy of Billboard as [...] "glammed-up without <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> '80s to be found", leaked on June 10, 2011.

They found that since 1489, only five acres of arable land in the parish had been enclosed for pasture, this by Henry Boson in 1513. Conversion of land use to sheep herding (which required few labourers) would not therefore seem to have been a concern at the time.|$|R
