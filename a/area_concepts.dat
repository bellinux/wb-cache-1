This paper shows how the TOPMODEL theory can be extended to handle this spatial variability, using a 2 D distribution function of a new soil depth-topographic index of hydrological similarity. A first sensitivity analysis of the effect of variable soil depths on the model predictions for the Maurets catchment, France, is presented. Predicted discharges and calibrated parameter values are not sensitive to the patterns of effective soil depth investigated.

40|$|As the air {{transportation}} system moves toward trajectory-based operations, {{there is a}} greater need for route modeling, especially in the terminal airspace where traffic flows twist and turn and many do not follow any currently published route. This paper presents a graph-based algorithmic method for defining nominal terminal routing from historical flight tracks. First historical traffic is used to generate a directed graph. Then Djikstra’s shortest path algorithm is used to identify the shortest yet most commonly used paths through the graph. There were many different nominal routes between different engine types due to the distinct differences in engine performance characteristics. A comparison of graph-based shortest path routes to two other methods (manual and k-means) showed how the method could rapidly produce similar distinct dominant terminal area flows. Finding shortest paths from all links of a sufficient weight, rather than just source nodes, identified more route options depicting standard path control techniques in addition to the dominant route. This method may be used to rapidly prototype route models to assess trajectory-based terminal <b>area</b> <b>concepts...</b>|$|E

The model realizes an inverse {{correlation between the}} compression zone to the entire section ratio and the eccentricity of the axial compression force due to biaxial moment resultant. Accordingly, the partially confined strength of eccentric loading is morphed between the fully confined case under pure axial compression and the unconfined case under pure bending. Therefore, incrementing the resultant moment and the axial compression takes place proportionally through radial loading to sustain constant eccentricity throughout the loading until failure. The uniaxial moment–axial compression versus uniaxial curvature–axial strain relationship is extended, {{within the framework of}} the moment of <b>area</b> <b>concept,</b> from a 2  ×  2 to a 3  ×  3 stiffness matrix in the case of biaxial bending.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of data-centric networks has intensified the research efforts {{for development of}} architectures and technologies supporting fast reconfigurable optical networks accommodating any temporal and (or) spatial traffic fluctuations without WDM channel overprovisioning. The novel core network architecture {{presented in this paper}} is based on partitioning a meshed network into a number of clusters. Within each cluster the architecture exploits metropolitan <b>area</b> <b>concepts</b> (MACs) to achieve statistical multiplexing gain by transparent transportation of fixed duration slots. These short slots, which are controlled by means of a MAC protocol, are combined to form larger frames that are then exchanged between the clusters. Specific nodes that serve as gateways between clusters undertake the coordination of frame switching and end-to-end routing. Thus, traffic within a particular cluster enjoys reservation-based no-loss transport, while for the communication between clusters either robust two-way reservation schemes or even optical burst switching (OBS) approaches are possible. The end result is an architecture that supports statistical multiplexing within the optical layer with good performance and reasonable complexity. © 2005 Optical Society of America...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to enrich}} the {{standard}} toolbox for measuring diversity in economics. In so doing, we compare the indicators of diversity used by economists with those used by biologists and ecologists. Ecologists and biologists are concerned about biodiversity: the diversity of organisms that inhabit a given <b>area.</b> <b>Concepts</b> of species diversity such as alpha (diversity within community), beta (diversity across communities) and gamma (diversity due to differences among samples when they are combined into a single sample) have been developed (Whittaker, 1960). Biodiversity {{is more complex than}} just the species that are present, it includes species richness and species evenness. Those various aspects of diversity are measured by biodiversity indices such as Simpson’s Diversity Indices, Species Richness Index, Shannon Weaver Diversity Indices, Patil and Taillie Index, Modified Hill’s Ratio. In economics, diversity measures are multi-faceted ranging from inequality (Lorenz curve, Gini coefficient, quintile distribution), to polarisation (Esteban and Ray, 1994; Wolfon, 1994, D’Ambrosio (2001)) and heterogeneity (Alesina, Baqir and Hoxby, 2000). We propose an interdisciplinary comparison between indicators. We review their theoretical background and applications. We provide an assessment of their possible use according to their specific properties. Diversity, Growth, Knowledge...|$|E

This study aims to determine areas and volume of overland flow generated from Infiltration Excess Overland Flow (IEOF) process by comparing the empirical Horton equation and physically based Green-Ampt equation with the visualisation of spatially based Geographic Information System (GIS) hydrologic modelling. Both equations are analysed by stressing on spatial data handling techniques of map projections and scales.
