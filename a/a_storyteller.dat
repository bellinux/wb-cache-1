25|$|Stories are {{effective}} educational tools because listeners become engaged and therefore remember. Storytelling {{can be seen}} as a foundation for learning and teaching. While the storylistener is engaged, they are able to imagine new perspectives, inviting a transformative and empathetic experience. This involves allowing the individual to actively engage in the story as well as observe, listen and participate with minimal guidance. Listening to <b>a</b> <b>storyteller</b> can create lasting personal connections, promote innovative problem solving and foster a shared understanding regarding future ambitions. The listener can then activate knowledge and imagine new possibilities. Together <b>a</b> <b>storyteller</b> and listener can seek best practices and invent new solutions. Because stories often have multiple layers of meanings, listeners have to listen closely to identify the underlying knowledge in the story. Storytelling is used as a tool to teach children the importance of respect through the practice of listening. As well as connecting children with their environment, through the theme of the stories, and give them more autonomy by using repetitive statements, which improve their learning to learn competence. It is also used to teach children to have respect for all life, value inter-connectedness and always work to overcome adversity. To teach this a Kinesthetic learningstyle would be used, involving the listeners through music, dream interpretation, or dance.|$|E
25|$|Story Telling-The protagonist, Anna Andrianovna, takes {{great pride}} in {{identifying}} herself as <b>a</b> <b>storyteller</b> and poet.

Though she presents her tale as the story of her children's lives, as the novel progresses, it becomes apparent that the story is not about Anna's children, but about Anna herself and the way she relates them.|$|E
25|$|Cody's {{headline}} performers {{were well}} known in their own right. Annie Oakley and her husband, Frank Butler, were sharpshooters, together {{with the likes of}} Gabriel Dumont and Lillian Smith. Performers re-enacted the riding of the Pony Express, Indian attacks on wagon trains, and stagecoach robberies. The show was said to end with a re-enactment of Custer's Last Stand, in which Cody portrayed General Custer, but this is more legend than fact. The finale was typically a portrayal of an Indian attack on a settler's cabin. Cody would ride in with an entourage of cowboys to defend a settler and his family. This finale was featured predominantly as early as 1886 but was not performed after 1907; it was used in 23 of 33 tours. Another celebrity appearing on the show was Calamity Jane, as <b>a</b> <b>storyteller</b> as of 1893.|$|E

25|$|The union between Moldavia and Wallachia in 1859 {{brought a}} growing {{consolidation}} of Romanian life and culture. Universities were opened in Iaşi and in Bucharest {{and the number}} of new cultural establishments grew significantly. The new prince from 1866 and then King of Romania, Carol I was a devoted king, and he and his wife Elisabeth were among the main patrons of arts. Of great impact in Romanian literature was the literary circle Junimea, founded by a group of people around the literary critic Titu Maiorescu in 1863. It published its cultural journal Convorbiri Literare where, among others, Mihai Eminescu, Romania's greatest poet, Ion Creangă, <b>a</b> <b>storyteller</b> of genius, and Ion Luca Caragiale, novelist and the Romania's greatest playwright published most of their works. During the same period, Nicolae Grigorescu and Ştefan Luchian founded modern Romanian painting; composer Ciprian Porumbescu was also from this time.|$|E

500|$|In the US, James Sandoe, {{writing in}} the New York Herald Tribune thought that For Your Eyes Only had [...] "urban savagery and mighty smooth tale-spinning". Writing in The New York Times, Anthony Boucher—described by a Fleming biographer, John Pearson as [...] "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"—described what his main issue with Fleming's work was: [...] "his basic {{weakness}} as <b>a</b> <b>storyteller,</b> which {{can be summed up}} in two words: 'no story.'" [...] In the short story form, however, Boucher finds that Bond's tales [...] "are proportionate" [...] and that Fleming's [...] "prose... is eminently smooth and readable" [...] even if [...] "Bond's triumphs are too simple and lack... intricate suspense".|$|E

500|$|Harries {{commented that}} he [...] "was {{interested}} {{in developing a}} quality action series out of the UK because it's something we don't do very often, but there's no reason why we shouldn't." [...] Richard Armitage called the series an [...] "ambitious project for television. But the advantage {{of that is that}} these three feature films are linked together so you get a really interesting character arc through all episodes. American television is being brave and doing that at the moment, and this is stepping into that area." [...] Former SAS soldier and the original novel's author, Chris Ryan, served as the series consultant and script advisor. Chris Ryan stated; [...] "When you produce a novel it's like a child and to see it put onto screen opens it up to a greater audience.

Green also echoes Quigly in asserting {{that none of}} Reed's successors could match his abilities as <b>a</b> <b>storyteller.</b> Quigly summarises Reed's legacy to future school story writers: he established a genre by [...] "alter the shapeless, long-winded, garrulous and moralistic school story" [...] into something popular and readable, a convention followed by all his successors. Reed himself expressed the guiding principles {{of his life in}} a letter addressed to a new Boys' Club in Manchester: [...] "The strong fellows should look after the weak, the active must look after the lazy, the merry must cheer up the dull, the sharp must lend a helping hand to the duffer.

500|$|Critic Darcy Sullivan saw {{the book}} as {{presenting}} how Brown's Playboy obsession affects his ability to relate to women. [...] Sullivan called The Playboy stories [...] "he most honest sex in comics" [...] of the early 1990s, [...] "and the most damning exposé of pornography" [...] as it deals [...] "with nothing more than Brown's relationship with Playboy". [...] He praises how quickly Brown matured as <b>a</b> <b>storyteller</b> {{over the course of}} The Playboy, and for the believability of scenes {{which may or may not}} have happened as Brown depicted them. [...] While seeming to acknowledge feminist concerns, Brown depicts himself as [...] "a victim of his urges", and that [...] "Playboy has kept him mentally separate". [...] Sullivan asserts the book shows that pornography does not merely satisfy a need, but fosters an addiction. [...] Brown's comics raise questions, rather than trying to answer them, an approach Sullivan compared favourably to that of Joe Matt's less subtle body of work, which also details a pornography obsession: he wrote that Matt's comics analyze and rationalize his obsession, while Brown's reveal.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for The Observer, Leo Robson found the novel to be {{somewhat}} underwhelming, stating that [...] "It is disappointing, given {{the vitality of the}} novel's setting and set-up, that Miller fails to achieve corresponding dynamism in the development of plot and character", adding that [...] "as a prose writer, Miller appears averse to taking risks, which means no pratfalls – but no glory either". He found the [...] "engineer's progress and his setbacks are narrated in a patient, tight-lipped present tense, and just as the novel rarely concerns itself with anything that doesn't impinge on the destruction of Les Innocents, so it rarely deviates from its obsessive regime of description and dialogue". He did somewhat temper this, however, stating that [...] "It is one of the historical novel's advantages over the topical or journalistic novel that the benchmark is plausibility rather than verifiable authenticity. Success in this effort requires a capacity for immersion and a degree of imagination, and whatever his shortcomings as a prose writer and <b>a</b> <b>storyteller,</b> Andrew Miller is endowed with both." ...|$|E
500|$|Songwriting for Augie March is {{primarily}} initiated by Richards; he delivers demos {{to the rest}} of the band members who then collaborate with him to develop the music.

Richards simply states that he enjoys [...] "dabbling with words", and that people often appreciate him doing so. Despite this, Richards rejects the [...] "literary" [...] reputation he believes the band have gained. At the 2006 ARIA Awards, Midnight Oil's Rob Hirst called for more political songs; Richards told Simon Collins of The West Australian he saw great risk in writing political music, and would rather write music that rung true, so that [...] "I can sing the song a thousand times after it's been written". Richards asserts he preferred to draw on everyday experiences than on literary influences. He also says that some of the music he writes is intentionally confusing.|$|E
