5|$|The adult has {{two pairs}} of long, narrow, multiveined, {{translucent}} wings and a long, slender abdomen. Although they somewhat resemble dragonflies or damselflies, they belong to a different infraclass of winged insects. Antlion adults are easily distinguished from damselflies by their prominent, apically clubbed antennae which <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> long as the head and thorax combined. Also, the pattern of wing venation differs, and compared to damselflies, the adults are very feeble fliers and are normally found fluttering about at night {{in search of a}} mate. Adult antlions are typically nocturnal, and rarely seen by day.|$|E
5|$|The upper incisors {{have two}} cusps {{and the upper}} canine has three—a large central one, a small but {{well-developed}} one at the back, and a small cuspule at the front. The front upper premolar is projected outside the toothrow, so that the canine before it and back premolar behind it touch. The first lower incisor has two cusps and the second has three. On the second lower molar, the protoconid cusp is notably taller than the hypoconid; these cusps <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> high in T.goodmani.|$|E
5|$|Transandinomys {{species are}} medium-sized, soft-furred rice rats. They closely {{resemble}} other medium-sized lowland forest rice rats, such as Hylaeamys and Euryoryzomys from the Amazon rainforest and surrounding areas and Handleyomys alfaroi from Central America and northwestern South America. In general, Transandinomys are distinguished from those animals {{by their very}} long superciliary vibrissae (whiskers above the eyes). Euryoryzomys species are in general slightly larger and Hylaeamys <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> large as Transandinomys, so that the only feature of external morphology that distinguishes the two genera is {{the length of the}} vibrissae. Handleyomys alfaroi is smaller than both species of Transandinomys, but juvenile Transandinomys may be confused with similarly colored adult H.alfaroi.|$|E

5|$|Both dorsal fins are {{immediately}} preceded by stout, grooved spines, {{with the second}} much longer than the first. The small first dorsal fin has a rounded apex and a nearly straight trailing margin, with its origin lying behind the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is rather angular and has about double {{the area of the}} first, with its origin located opposite the midpoint of the pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are small and rounded. The pelvic fins <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> large as the second dorsal fin, with rounded tips and nearly straight trailing margins. The caudal peduncle is short and leads to a broad caudal fin comprising {{less than a quarter of}} the total length; the upper lobe has a convex upper margin leading to a squared-off tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is densely covered by tiny dermal denticles; each one is recurved and thorn-like, rising from an irregular star-shaped base. This species is a plain dark brown above, darkening to almost black below, with white dorsal fin spines. Juvenile sharks have white edges on the dorsal, pectoral, and pelvic fins. Minute, luminescent dots are scattered about the skin without a regular pattern.|$|E
5|$|The two dorsal fins are {{of nearly}} equal size and placed far {{back on the}} body, with the first {{originating}} over the latter third of the pelvic fin bases and the second over {{the latter half of}} the anal fin base. The pectoral and pelvic fins are broad and rounded; the males have stout claspers. The pelvic and anal fins <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> large as the dorsal fins. The broad caudal fin comprises about a fifth of the total body length and has a strong notch near the tip of the upper lobe and an indistinct lower lobe. The skin is thick and covered by well-calcified arrowhead-shaped dermal denticles. The coloration of the dark shyshark is highly variable, and particular individuals can resemble any of the other shyshark species. The background color ranges from light brown to reddish to grayish to almost black above, transitioning abruptly to white or cream below, sometimes with dark blotches beneath the paired fins. There may be 68 orange, brown, or blackish variably shaped saddles along the back and tail, edged more or less obviously in black. There may also be white spots within or within and between the saddles.|$|E
5|$|Transandinomys talamancae is a medium-sized, {{brightly colored}} rice rat. It {{is similar to}} T.bolivaris and the two are often confused. They <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> large, but in T.talamancae the tail is longer and the hindfeet shorter. Both species share uniquely long vibrissae, with both the mystacial (above the mouth) and superciliary vibrissae {{extending}} to or beyond the back margin of the ears when laid back against the head, but those in T.bolivaris are substantially longer. H.alfaroi, a widespread species ranging from Mexico to Ecuador, is also similar. It is smaller and darker, but young adult T.talamancae are similar in color to adult H.alfaroi and often misidentified. Hylaeamys megacephalus, with which T.talamancae was synonymized for some decades, is similar in body size, but is not known to overlap with T.talamancae in range.|$|E

5|$|The molar is {{plane and}} hypsodont: the crowns are {{relatively}} {{high and the}} main cusps <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> high as {{the other parts of}} the crown, as they are in Holochilus. Most other oryzomyines have bunodont and brachydont molars, in which the crowns are lower and the cusps are higher {{than the rest of the}} crown. As in closely related species, the front part of the molar is relatively simple, lacking an anteroloph, an additional ridge that is well-developed in most oryzomyines. A shallow anteromedian flexus is present, superficially dividing the front cusp (anterocone). Uniquely, the anterior mure, which connects the anterocone to the rest of the crown, is absent; although this structure is sometimes missing in young individuals of other oryzomyines, it usually develops as a result of wear in adults. The two cusps on the middle part of the molar, the paracone and the protocone, are broadly connected. The median mure, which connects the middle to the back pair of cusps, is attached to the back of the paracone. A complete mesoloph is present, descending from the median mure slightly behind the paracone. The configuration of the paracone–median mure–mesoloph complex is unique to Carletonomys. The two posterior cusps, the hypocone and the metacone, are connected at the back margin of the molar. Unlike in most oryzomyines, no posteroflexus is present, so that the metacone is situated directly at the back margin.|$|E

25|$|At this point, {{the toilet}} parts without their molds look like and <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> strong as soft clay. After about one hour the top core mold (interior of toilet) is removed. The rim mold bottom (which {{includes}} {{a place to}} mount the holding tank) is removed, and it then has appropriate slanted holes for the rinsing jets cut, and the mounting holes for tank and seat are punched into the rim piece. Valve holes for rapid water entry into the toilet are cut into the rim pieces. The exposed top of the bowl piece is then covered with a thick slip and the still-uncured rim is attached {{on top of the}} bowl so that the bowl and hollow rim are now a single piece. The bowl plus rim is then inverted, and the toilet bowl is set upside down on the top rim mold to hold the pieces together as they dry. Later, {{all the rest of the}} mold pieces are removed. As the clay body dries further it hardens more and continues to shrink. After a few hours, the casting is self-supporting, and is called greenware.|$|E

25|$|The {{household}} income levels of American Muslims <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> evenly distributed {{as the general}} American population. Among South Asians in the country, the large Pakistani American community stands out as particularly well educated and prosperous, with education and income levels exceeding those of U.S.-born whites. Many are professionals, especially in medicine (they account for 2.7-5% of America’s physicians), scientists, engineers, and financial analysts, {{and there are also}} a large number of entrepreneurs. There are more than 15,000 medical doctors practicing medicine in the USA who are of Pakistani origin alone and the number of Pakistani American millionaires was reported to be in the thousands. Shahid Khan a Pakistani-born American multi billionaire businessmen owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL) making him the first and only ethnic minority member to own one, he also owns English Premier League team Fulham F.C., and automobile parts manufacturer Flex-N-Gate in Urbana, Illinois. 45 percent of immigrant Muslims report annual {{household income}} levels of $50,000 or higher. This compares to the national average of 44 percent. Immigrant Muslims are well represented among higher-income earners, with 19 percent having annual household incomes of $100,000 or higher (compared to 16 percent for the Muslim population as a whole and 17 percent for the U.S. average). This is likely due to the strong concentration of Muslims in professional, managerial, and technical fields, especially in information technology, education, medicine, law, and the corporate world.|$|E
500|$|Krause listed five {{features}} that indicate that UA 8699 is a marsupial, not a placental or primitive therian. There is a well-developed cingulid at the outer back margin (distobuccally), between the hypoconid (one {{of the main}} cusps) and the hypoconulid (a smaller cuspule). The hypoconulid itself is located far lingually, relatively far from the hypoconid. The trigonid and talonid <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> broad, the trigonid is low-crowned, and wear is mainly horizontal, resulting in broad, flat exposed wear facets. Averianov and colleagues noted that zhelestids, a placental group, share all those traits, though to varying degrees, and that the hypoconulid in similarly aged marsupials is even more lingually located, [...] "twinned" [...] to the entoconid (the cusp on the back lingual corner of the tooth). They wrote that the specimen is on the whole more similar to zhelestids than to marsupials.|$|E

500|$|In 1882, {{seeking more}} {{professional}} orchestral experience, Elgar {{was employed to}} play violin in Birmingham with William Stockley's Orchestra, for whom he would play every concert {{for the next seven}} years and where he later claimed he [...] "learned all the music I know". On 13 December 1883 he took part with Stockley in a performance at Birmingham Town Hall of one of his first works for full orchestra, the Sérénade mauresque – the first time one of his compositions had been performed by a professional orchestra. Stockley had invited him to conduct the piece but later recalled [...] "he declined, and, further, insisted upon playing in his place in the orchestra. The consequence was that he had to appear, fiddle in hand, to acknowledge the genuine and hearty applause of the audience." [...] Elgar often went to London in an attempt to get his works published, but this period in his life found him frequently despondent and low on money. He wrote to a friend in April 1884, [...] "My prospects <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> hopeless as ever ...

500|$|The regular combat was {{reviewed}} as solid, if not exceptional, and the sidequests {{were seen as}} repetitive, with Quillen saying that [...] "the side quests in Nier <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> numerous as they are totally mindless," [...] VanOrd calling them [...] "a series of monotonous events, often connected only by long stretches of nothing," [...] and a Famitsu reviewer saying that they [...] "didn't see much purpose" [...] to them. Clements said that the combat had [...] "a fair amount of satisfaction", though players should [...] "not expect anything too extraordinary", and Kolan termed the combat as [...] "moderately deep". Critics gave a generally positive review to the plot and characters; VanOrd liked most of the characters but thought Nier was bland and the story [...] "soggy", while Schiesel called the story [...] "provocative" [...] and [...] "profound", saying that it [...] "succeeds at fostering an emotional investment in its characters and in its world". Quillen said that the plot [...] "takes some fascinating and truly original turns" [...] and that Nier has [...] "a supporting cast of genuinely interesting folks," [...] and Schilling said that the story made the game [...] "difficult to dislike".

500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on March 3, 1911. The Billboards reviewer gave a positive review and asserted, [...] "Any motion picture in which the views of 'back on the stage' are shown possesses {{a certain degree of}} interest. The ever-curious public is fascinated by the alluring stories of the stage world, and any peep it is given into this realm is welcomed. Because of this, Stage Struck derives the interest it has. As far as the story is concerned there is no special recommendation for it. ... The theatre settings <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> faithful depictions of stage scenes as are found in motion pictures. The player portraying the role of the leading actor very much exaggerates in makeup. The photography is very good." [...] Both the The Morning Telegraph and The New York Dramatic Mirror thought the conclusion was impossible turn of events. The Telegraphs reviewer wrote, [...] "An excellent opportunity was sadly missed for the exposition of a strong lesson to the uninitiated girl or boy who dreams of a career before the footlights. How any author or producer could permit such an impossible ending is a wonder. Can any sensible person imagine a New York manager offering an inexperienced amateur a leading part in a Broadway production? Yet this is what occurs in this tale of a stage-struck miss who joins a repertoire company, is stranded, gets home through the generosity of a traveling salesman and then, with no lapse of time or experience noted, receives a letter with such an offer! Most of the play was well put on and ably acted. The 'star' of the theatrical company wore an abominable wig, which could be distinguished as false. More care and thought would have made this an admirable offering." [...] The Mirror reviewer stated, [...] "The production leaves the impression of being exceedingly well done, but to the average actor the New York engagement, after forsaking her barnstorming company of players, seems somewhat of a dream. It was also startling to see her playing Ophelia after such a flat failure at the previous rehearsal where another took her place." [...] According to the synopsis, it is likely that this New York production in which she foresees herself on stage as Ophelia is a dream because it is prompted by the two letters she received at home.|$|E
