25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, the battery contributed a number of personnel to the Second Australian Imperial Force that was raised for overseas service and, as a result, during the early period of the war, its establishment declined. In late 1941, following Japan's entry into the war, the battery contributed personnel to the 13th Field Artillery Regiment upon its mobilisation. During the first half of 1942, the battery undertook coastal defence duties in South Australia before losing its horses and re-equipping with eight Ordnance QF 25 pounder artillery pieces and moving to Frankston, Victoria. Later in the year, the battery moved to Holsworthy, New South Wales. In December 1942, the battery was gazetted as an AIF unit, which meant that because its personnel had volunteered for overseas service, it could be sent <b>anywhere</b> <b>to</b> fight during the war. In 1943, the battery moved to Queensland before being sent to Port Moresby in New Guinea where it became part of the 13th Field Regiment. They remained in New Guinea until October 1943 when the regiment was withdrawn back to Australia. Throughout 1944, the battery undertook training on the Atherton Tablelands as the 13th Field Regiment was reassigned to the 11th Division. They remained in Australia {{until the end of the}} war, when the regiment's personnel were demobilised and the regiment disbanded.|$|E

He teaches Liam about {{antiques}} but considers returning to Upton Park as he hasn't seen <b>anywhere</b> <b>to</b> move his business to. When Carol discovers that Eddie has allowed Liam to skip school, they argue and Carol {{tells him to}} stay away from her and Liam. Eddie discovers that someone is squatting in a local lock-up and decides to take over the premises. Eddie asks Liam to watch his stock, which he leaves in the gardens. Eddie's son, Anthony (Matt Lapinskas), poses {{as a member of the}} council to force the squatter out. Eddie returns to find his stock on fire and cannot extinguish the flames. He confronts Michael, thinking he started the fire, but Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold) told Liam that she was responsible in revenge for comments Anthony and Tyler made about her grandfather Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick). Eddie finds out it was Lola and confronts her. Eddie and Michael seemingly make amends but Eddie is unaware that Michael has a plan. He later gets a letter that intrigues Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) and she becomes fascinated by Eddie. When she tells him she knows his secret, that he wears silk underwear, Eddie assumes she read the letter and shouts at her. Eddie moves into a house on Albert Square and tells Michael that he likes Carol. They are set up by Eddie's sons to spend time alone and are caught under a blanket by Tyler and Anthony.|$|E

500|$|As with {{previous}} years there were {{protests against the}} race going forward. The protests highlighted {{the situation of the}} Shi'ite majority in the Sunni-ruled Arab country, demanding the release of political prisoners. The protesters tried to use the arrival of Formula One to bring their demands into the public eye. The race came only one week after a report was published by Amnesty International about [...] "unabated" [...] human rights violations in Bahrain. In previous years, Formula One commercial rights executive Bernie Ecclestone had maintained the view that the political situation should be kept separate from the sport, saying in 2013: [...] "We're not here, or we don't go <b>anywhere,</b> <b>to</b> judge how a country is run". However, in what was viewed as a [...] "180-degree policy reversal", Formula One issued a statement ahead of the 2015 Grand Prix, stating that it [...] "has committed itself to respecting human rights in Bahrain and other countries in which it conducts business".|$|E

[...] Meanwhile, Sebastian Vettel insisted that [...] "it was fairly clear [...] When I got close enough I went around the outside, braking later and still managing to get the corner. I was clearly ahead and then I saw him opening the brakes into {{the last part of}} the chicane, so I reacted and jumped the second part because if I started on the track, we would have crashed." [...] Nico Hülkenberg in turn declared that Vettel [...] "didn't leave me <b>anywhere</b> <b>to</b> go so to avoid contact I kept braking, lost the rear and spun". He did however voice satisfaction with his result, finishing eighth and taking four championship points.|$|E

The inaugural Tobis Filmkunst production, {{it was not}} a drama, but a {{documentary}} sponsored by a shipping line: Melodie der Welt (Melody of the World), directed by Walter Ruttmann. This was also perhaps the first feature film <b>anywhere</b> <b>to</b> significantly explore the artistic possibilities of joining the motion picture with recorded sound. As described by scholar William Moritz, the movie is [...] "intricate, dynamic, fast-paced... juxtapos similar cultural habits from countries around the world, with a superb orchestral score... and many synchronized sound effects." [...] Composer Lou Lichtveld was among a number of contemporary artists struck by the film: [...] "Melodie der Welt became the first important sound documentary, the first in which musical and unmusical sounds were composed into a single unit and in which image and sound are controlled by one and the same impulse." [...] Melodie der Welt was a direct influence on the industrial film Philips Radio (1931), directed by Dutch avant-garde filmmaker Joris Ivens and scored by Lichtveld, who described its audiovisual aims: ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{this episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote that though it was [...] "funny {{in all the right}} places, this is an episode of two distinct stories, neither of which mesh together. The whole Ed Begley, Jr. saving the forest bit seems to have been tacked on, as if the stuff about Homer finding his name being abused (shades of Mr. Sparkle again?) ran out of steam. Not a bad show, more a sort of 'So what?' show." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 7.7/10 rating, commenting that [...] "it has a number of really funny scenes and memorable lines", but overall [...] "the storyline didn't really have <b>anywhere</b> <b>to</b> go and the final half of the third act is a complete waste of time." [...] Morgan Larrick of About.com noted [...] "Homer to the Max" [...] as [...] "one of the most unforgettable episodes" [...] when reviewing the complete tenth season.|$|E
500|$|Motion City Soundtrack {{was formed}} in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1997 by singer-songwriter Justin Pierre and guitarist Joshua Cain. By 1997, the duo had already played {{in a number of}} bands. Prior to {{founding}} Motion City Soundtrack, Cain was in a group named the Saddest Girl Story and Pierre was working on local productions. After other members left, Cain recruited Pierre to join the band as a singer. After Cain moved on from Boxcar, they founded Motion City Soundtrack together. The band's name, as well as the name of their debut album, were created by Cain's brother, Brian. Their early days were difficult, as they found it hard to break out of their local Minneapolis scene. When they could get weeks off from their jobs, they would tour. According to Cain, the members of the band soon realized that there [...] "wasn't really <b>anywhere</b> <b>to</b> play [...] in Minneapolis", and {{that they would have to}} [...] "tour all the time" [...] to rise in popularity. The band went through several lineup changes. Through these, Cain and Pierre would often have to take over keyboard duties during shows. The group's first release was a 7" [...] single, [...] "Promenade / Carolina", released in 1999. Their next two releases, both extended plays—Kids for America and Back to the Beat—were released the following year.|$|E

500|$|Glastonbury 2007 (20–24 June) was headlined by Arctic Monkeys, The Killers, and The Who on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Dame Shirley Bassey {{was also}} featured. [...] In 2007, over 700 acts played on over 80 stages and the {{capacity}} expanded by 20,000 to 177,000. This was the first year that [...] "The Park" [...] area opened. Designed by Emily Eavis, its main stage featured extra sets by several artists playing on the main stages including Pete Doherty and Gruff Rhys, whilst the BBC launched their new [...] "Introducing" [...] stage in the area. The festival had the largest attendance since {{the construction of the}} security fence, and the largest legitimate attendance to date: ticket allocation was raised by 27,500 to 137,500, which were charged at £145 and sold out in 1 hour 45 minutes. [...] As an extra precaution against touts (scalpers), purchasers had to pre-register, including submission of a passport photo which was security printed into the ticket. Continued periods of rain throughout much of the festival caused muddy conditions, though without the flooding of 2005, in part due to the new £750,000 flood defences. However this constant rain made the general conditions within the site worse than 2 years before and more like the mud plains of 1998. It was difficult to find <b>anywhere</b> <b>to</b> sit down that had not turned to mud and key choke points, such as the thoroughfare at the front right of the Pyramid stage, turned into a quagmire. Muddy conditions on the temporary roads {{on the periphery of the}} site led to delays for people leaving the site. On 25 June, when the vast majority of festival goers were attempting to leave the festival, cars in the western car parks took over nine hours to exit the site. There was no stewarding provision in these areas, no information was disseminated regarding the delays, no organised marshalling of traffic was undertaken by the festival organisers, and no provision of drinking water was made to people stranded in their vehicles. Verbal and physical violence was witnessed between festival goers. When cars were finally allowed to leave the site the surrounding roads were found to be clear. Reported crime was down from 2005 but the number of arrests were [...] "well up", after a proactive operation of the police and security on site. There were 236 reported crimes, down from 267 in 2005; of these, 158 were drug related (183 in 2005). 1,200 people required medical aid with 32 hospitalised, most of which were accidents caused by the mud. There was one fatality: a West Midlands man found unconscious early on the Saturday morning died in Yeovil District Hospital of a suspected drugs overdose.|$|E
