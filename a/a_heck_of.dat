500|$|On {{the back}} of two {{consecutive}} playoff disappointments, Duncan improved statistically in the 2001–02 season. He averaged career highs in scoring (25.5 points per game, including a league-leading 764 field goals and 560 attempted free throws) and rebounding (12.7 boards per game, and his accumulated 1042 boards again led the league), and also averaged 3.7 assists and 2.5 blocks per game, both career highs. Coupled with another pair of All-NBA and All-Defensive First Team call-ups, he was named the league's Most Valuable Player, joining teammate David Robinson as the only Spurs members to earn the honor. On the other hand, Duncan's team struggled {{with the fact that}} the aging Robinson was no longer able to sustain his level of performance, and backup center-forward Malik Rose had to step in more often. In the 2002 NBA Playoffs, the Spurs were again outmatched by the Lakers. Up against star center O'Neal once more, the Spurs were defeated 4–1 by the eventual champions. Duncan, who managed 34 points and a franchise-high 25 rebounds in Game 5, stated his frustration: [...] "I thought we really had a chance at this series.

Scott declined to comment to the media about why he had missed curfew, and Friedgen said only that Scott had tried to [...] "help somebody and got put in a bad situation." [...] Friedgen initially intended to send the offenders back to College Park by bus, but athletic director Deborah Yow convinced him to issue partial-game suspensions instead. Scott was benched until halfway through the third quarter. He said, [...] "I made a bad decision. I felt I had to run with a purpose." [...] Scott was put into the game on Maryland's third possession of the half but did not receive a carry until the following series. On his first attempt, he ran for 14yards and then ran 11yards on his second. During the next drive, he broke free on a 49-yard touchdown run. On the next possession, Scott rushed on all four plays and gained 66yards and another touchdown. Maryland won, 42–35, and Scott was named the Terrapins' most valuable player of the game. Nevada head coach Chris Ault said, [...] "He just ran through us like we weren't there. They ran the weak-side gap, we knew that was one of their base plays, and he did a great job. He's <b>a</b> <b>heck</b> <b>of</b> a back, no question about it. He was breaking tackles, and that's not only a difference-maker but a morale-changer." [...] He ran for 174yards, which broke the school record for rushing in a bowl game previously set by Lu Gambino in the 1948 Gator Bowl. Scott also became just the seventh Maryland player to surpass the 1,000-yard single-season rushing benchmark. Earlier in the season, Scott set that mark as one of his goals, and he adorned his room with the statistics of the Terrapins who accomplished that feat in the past, such as Chris Downs in 2002.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} work {{to synthesise}} i) a novel class of non-racemic amino acid derived macrocycfes through the Heck reaction and ii) new chiral tridentate nitrogen ligands. The synthesis of known macrocycfes, derived from both valine and proline, {{has been achieved}} for further complexation studies. These macrocycles are formed through <b>a</b> <b>Heck</b> coupling <b>of</b> two molecules of an iodo-alkene precursor and contain four nitrogen atoms (two amino and two amido) which are capable of binding. The key steps in the synthesis are the reductive amination of the appropriate amino alcohol with 4 -iodobenzaldehyde and a Mitsonobu reaction to introduce the nitrogen for the amide group. An {{increase in the number}} of donor atoms in the macrocycfes was predicted to lead to more efficient binding to the macrocycle and therefore lead to further applications. The replacement of the benzyl moiety with a pyridine increases the number of donor atoms to six. The synthesis of pyridine containing macrocycfes derived from proline, valine and phenylalanine has been investigated. A similar synthetic strategy was followed but iodine was introduced through halogen exchange and alternative reaction conditions to the Mitsonobu reaction were investigated. An intermediate during the synthesis of the pyridine based macrocycfes is a small chiral amine which has three nitrogen atoms each in a different environment. It was recognised that these would make interesting ligands and their synthesis has been investigated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
