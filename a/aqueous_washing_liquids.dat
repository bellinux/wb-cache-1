40|$|Arsenic-based {{pesticide}} residues {{have been detected}} on Arizona State Museum’s (ASM) Diné (Navajo) textile collection using a handheld portable X-ray (pXRF) spectrometer. The removal of this toxic pesticide from historic textiles in museums and collections is necessary to reduce potential health risks to Native American communities, museum professionals, and visitors to these cultural institutions. A leader in engineering innovative pesticide removal methods, ASM received federal funding support to continue essential research in removing heavy metal pesticides from cultural property. The research objective was divided into three interconnected stages: (1) calibrate the pXRF instrument for arsenic contaminated cotton and wool textiles; (2) engineer a textile conservation <b>aqueous</b> <b>washing</b> treatment to remove arsenic from wool textiles; (3) demonstrate the <b>aqueous</b> <b>washing</b> treatment method on actual Navajo textiles known to have arsenic-based {{pesticide residues}}. The calibration process consisted of a dipping method to produce known homogenous arsenic cotton and wool test samples saturated with solutions of 100, 500, 1000, 2500, and 5000 parts per million (ppm). A linear correlation between observed pXRF test readings and formulated arsenic solutions corroborated the instruments range of detection for arsenic on specific textile materials. The calibration confirms that the pXRF is suitable instrument to measure the removal of arsenic from wool textiles. Wool test samples treated with solutions of an arsenic concentration of 1000 ppm were used to develop an optimal <b>aqueous</b> <b>washing</b> treatment exploring the effects of time, temperature, agitation, and pH conditions to efficiently remove arsenic while minimizing damage to the structure and properties of the textile. Each conditional effect removed {{a certain percentage of}} arsenic, although the most efficient <b>aqueous</b> <b>washing</b> treatment consisted of submerging a wool textile in deionized water at room temperature for ten minutes with the greatest level of agitation within reason to minimize damage the textile. The final stage of the research applied the <b>aqueous</b> <b>washing</b> guidelines formulated from experimental research on three historic ASM Navajo textiles. Two textiles contained low arsenic concentrations (< 100 ppm), and one tested with a high arsenic concentration (~ 1000 ppm). The <b>aqueous</b> <b>washing</b> treatment resulted in minimal change for low arsenic concentration textiles, and a 96 % removal of arsenic on a high arsenic concentration textile. The preliminary success of removing arsenic-based pesticide residues from historic Navajo textiles greatly impacts the future management of historic textile collections, and also raises questions to further refine the research methodology or pursue alternative related research such as engineering a closed circulating arsenic removal system to limit the quantity of toxic water...|$|R

40|$|High {{levels of}} dioxin {{contamination}} in soil have significant environmental challenges. Soil washing {{is a successful}} remediation process that is primarily used to treat coarse soils. Several literature studies have used various kinds of chemical <b>washing</b> <b>liquids</b> to remove dioxins from soils, though there are secondary environmental effects. This study intends to develop environmentally friendly soil washing methods that are effective in dioxin removal at an acceptable cost.

These compounds are related to their bio-surfactant content. Several of the identified compounds had properties to help remove dioxins from contaminated soil. In the experiments, high removal efficiencies were observed, up to 70 %~ 95 % after five to six washes. Although effective removal was observed, {{a significant amount of}} wastewater was produced and the problems were not completely resolved.

The experimental part was carried out at a falling film pilot plant evaporator at the division of Heat and Power Technology at Chalmers University of Technology. In order to study the dissolution, a scaling layer was build up by evaporation of a saline solution which was then washed off by black liquor at different temperatures and flow rates. During washing the outgoing dry solid content of the <b>wash</b> <b>liquid</b> was measured along with the scaling layer thickness.

The influence of relative humidity on the corrosion of iron powder mixed with βFeOOH is examined by dynamic mass change within a climatic chamber. At 20 °C and 12 % relative humidity, iron in contact with βFeOOH did not corrode.

40|$|Few {{publications}} address how to efficiently remove sodium {{scales in}} black liquor evaporators. The {{lack of information}} makes the cleaning inefficient and subjective. In this work, the sodium scale dissolution rate has been experimentally investigated and {{a model for the}} dissolution process has been developed. The aim was to relate the dissolution rate to wetting degree and temperature of the <b>wash</b> <b>liquid.</b> The experiments were conducted in a pilot plant evaporator of the falling film type. A saline solution consisting of sodium carbonate and sodium sulphate was evaporated on the outside of a vertical stainless steel tube. The removal of the resulting scaling layer was then studied at different temperatures and wetting degrees. An effective method for investigating the removal of sodium scales in falling film evaporators was developed and a model was constructed that successfully could predict the obtained experimental data. The washing behaviour proved to be strongly dependent on how the scales were distributed along the tube. It was confirmed that scales grow {{from the bottom of the}} tube and upwards until the layer reaches an equilibrium thickness. The dissolution rate was found to follow a 1 st order expression with regards to the concentration difference between the scaling layer surface and the bulk of the <b>wash</b> <b>liquid.</b> The model was developed in the temperature interval 45 85 °C and wetting degrees of 0. 13 kg/ms up to 0. 44 kg/ms.

40|$|The enzymatic {{degradation}} of cellulose polymers {{is currently a}} rate-limiting step in the bioconversion of biomass to biofuels. Cellulose polymers self assemble to form crystalline structures stabilized by a complex network of intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding.

To improve the degradability of cellulose the intermolecular interactions must be disrupted.
