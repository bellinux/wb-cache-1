5|$|As is his pattern, Hosseini drew on {{his early}} {{experiences}} in Afghanistan {{to create the}} foundation of the book. He states that his travels to Afghanistan later in life also influenced his writing, albeit involuntarily. For example, during a 2009 visit he met two young sisters in a remote village outside Kabul. The older one, who he estimated to be <b>around</b> <b>six</b> years old, acted as a mother figure to the younger girl.

5|$|Koalas {{may live}} from 13 to 18 {{years in the}} wild. While female koalas usually live this long, males may die sooner because of their more {{hazardous}} lives. Koalas usually survive falls from trees and immediately climb back up, but injuries and deaths from falls do occur, particularly in inexperienced young and fighting males. <b>Around</b> <b>six</b> years of age, the koala's chewing teeth begin to wear down and their chewing efficiency decreases. Eventually, the cusps disappear completely and the animal will die of starvation.|$|E

The show was advertised as [...] "the most interesting invention of the modern age" [...] and played to capacity crowds for around four weeks.

5|$|Additional {{concerns}} are hypothyroidism, allergies, epilepsy, diabeties and glandular disorders which may cause baldness. The hair loss occurs at <b>around</b> <b>six</b> months of age, affecting the neck, thighs and tail; however the frequency {{has been reduced}} through work conducted by the breed clubs. Hip dysplasia is seen in around 8.3% of the breed, according to surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals over a twenty five-year period between 1974 and 1999. This {{was one of the}} lower results of the sporting breeds, with Greyhounds coming lowest with 3.4%, and the related Boykin Spaniel coming in second highest at 47%. There was no evidence of elbow dysplasia found. The breed has an average life span of 1013 years.|$|E
5|$|After 400–500 {{accumulated}} degree-days above , adults {{begin to}} emerge from trees in late spring, and peak emergence occurs around 1000 degree-days. After emergence, adults feed for one week on ash leaves in the canopy before mating, but cause little defoliation in the process. Males hover around trees, locate females by visual cues, and drop directly onto the female to mate; mating can last 50 minutes, and females may mate with multiple males over their lifespan. A typical female can live <b>around</b> <b>six</b> weeks and lay approximately 40–70 eggs, but females that live longer can lay up to 200 eggs.|$|E

5|$|After birth, {{the mother}} cleans the cubs, and can then {{recognize}} each by its smell. At first, she spends 60% to 90% {{of her time}} with the cubs. After the first week, the mother starts spending more time outside the nest, returning every few hours to nurse and groom the cubs. She moves the young frequently among several nests, all of which she keeps clean. The cubs start to open their eyes at about 18 days of age. By about 90 days, they have achieved full adult fur and coloring, and begin to venture out of the nest. They also start eating solid foods at this point, weaning at <b>around</b> <b>six</b> to eight months of age. The cubs stay with their mother until the next litter is born in the following summer. Males rarely help raise the young, and only if they live in pairs or in small groups.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ericifolia {{depends on}} fire for regeneration; if fires are too infrequent, populations age and {{eventually}} die out. However, too-frequent fires also threaten this species, which takes <b>around</b> <b>six</b> {{years to reach}} maturity and flower. One study estimated an optimum fire interval of 15–30years. For {{a large part of}} its distribution Banksia ericifolia grows near areas of human habitation on Australia's eastern coastline. Bushland near urban areas is subject to both arson and prescribed burns, drastically reducing fire intervals and resulting in the disappearance of the species from some areas. The hotter a fire the more quickly seed is released; timing of rains afterwards is also critical for seedling survival.|$|E

5|$|Breeding {{takes place}} in May and June, and {{fighting}} among females for a mate is common. Females can mate several times and lay several clutches of eggs in one season. The male does the incubation; during this process he hardly eats or drinks and loses {{a significant amount of}} weight. The eggs hatch after around eight weeks, and the young are nurtured by their fathers. They reach full size after <b>around</b> <b>six</b> months, but can remain as a family unit until the next breeding season.

5|$|Cats {{are ready}} to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age, when they {{are ready to}} leave their mother. They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as 7 weeks to limit {{unwanted}} reproduction. This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females. Traditionally, this surgery was performed at <b>around</b> <b>six</b> to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed prior to puberty, at about three to six months. In the US, about 80% of household cats are neutered.|$|E
