50|$|These {{batteries}} include but are {{not limited}} to: car batteries, golf cart batteries, UPS batteries, industrial fork-lift batteries, motorcycle batteries, and commercial batteries. These can be regular lead-acid, sealed lead-acid, gel type, or <b>absorbed</b> <b>glass</b> <b>mat</b> <b>batteries.</b> These are recycled by grinding them, neutralizing the acid, and separating the polymers from the lead. The recovered materials are used in a variety of applications, including new batteries.|$|E

5000|$|The U.S. Military has KLR650s {{modified}} by Hayes Diversified Technologies to burn military-spec fuels including diesel. (M1030M1) All-new engines {{were designed to}} replace the 4-stroke gasoline engines. The new engines employ the original unit-construction main cases and transmission, but with new piston, cylinder, and other components. The balancing system that {{is used in the}} gasoline KLR650 engines (to reduce engine vibration) was removed from the military diesel KLR engines. Some components of the military diesel version can be applied to [...] "civilian" [...] KLR650 models, such as the nonspillable <b>absorbed</b> <b>glass</b> <b>mat</b> <b>battery</b> which offers several advantages over the conventional unsealed KLR batteries.|$|R

50|$|Deep-cycle {{lead-acid}} batteries generally {{fall into}} two distinct categories; flooded (FLA) and valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA), with the VRLA type further subdivided into two types, <b>Absorbed</b> <b>Glass</b> <b>Mat</b> (AGM) and Gel. The reinforcement of <b>absorbed</b> <b>glass</b> <b>mat</b> separators helps to reduce damage caused by spilling and jolting vibrations. Further, flooded deep-cycle batteries {{can be divided into}} subcategories of Tubular-plated Opzs or flat plated. The difference generally affects the cycle life and performance of the cell. The structural difference between deep-cycle batteries and cranking batteries is in the lead battery plates. Deep cycle battery plates have thicker active plates, with higher-density active paste material and thicker separators. Alloys used for the plates in a deep cycle battery may contain more antimony than that of starting batteries. The thicker battery plates resist corrosion through extended charge and discharge cycles.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} primary types of VRLA batteries, Sealed VR wet cell, AGM and Gel. Gel cells add silica dust to the electrolyte, forming a thick putty-like gel. These are {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "silicone batteries". AGM (Absorbent <b>Glass</b> <b>Mat)</b> <b>batteries</b> feature fiberglass mesh between the battery plates which serves to contain the electrolyte. Both designs offer advantages and disadvantages compared to conventional batteries and sealed VR wet cells, as well as each other.|$|R
50|$|In the <b>absorbed</b> <b>glass</b> <b>mat</b> design, or AGM for short, {{the spaces}} between the cells is {{replaced}} by a <b>glass</b> fibre <b>mat</b> soaked in electrolyte. There is only enough electrolyte in the mat to keep it wet, and if the battery is punctured the electrolyte will not flow out of the mats. Likewise, the mat greatly reduces evaporation, {{to the point that the}} batteries do not require periodic refilling of the water. This combination of features allows the battery to be completely sealed, which makes them useful in portable devices and similar roles.|$|R
5000|$|Using a gel {{electrolyte}} {{instead of}} a liquid allows the battery {{to be used in}} different positions without leakage. Gel electrolyte batteries for any position date from 1930s, and even in the late 1920s portable suitcase radio sets allowed the cell vertical or horizontal (but not inverted) due to valve design (see third Edition of Wireless Constructor's Encyclopaedia by Frederick James Camm). In the 1970s, the valve-regulated lead acid battery (often called [...] "sealed") was developed, including modern <b>absorbed</b> <b>glass</b> <b>mat</b> types, allowing operation in any position.|$|R
5000|$|The 2010-2012 {{production}} ActiveHybrid 7 {{uses the}} engine from 750i plus {{an electric motor}} rated [...] and 210 Nm torque. The electric motor is integrated into the transmission housing, replacing alternator and starter. The battery is a lithium-ion type and located under the boot floor. Other features include auto start stop and an 8-speed automatic transmission. The hybrid system {{was based on the}} 2-mode hybrid from Daimler AG. The regenerative braking unit includes 12V Absorbent <b>Glass</b> <b>Mat</b> <b>batteries,</b> running in parallel to 120V electrical network for electric motor. BMW claims it improved fuel consumption and reduced emissions by 15% over the non-hybrid model.|$|R

50|$|IUoU battery {{charging}} is a three-stage charging procedure for lead-acid batteries. A lead-acid battery's theoretical voltage is 2 V for one cell. For a single cell, the voltage {{can range from}} 1.8 V loaded at full discharge, to 2.10 V in an open circuit at full charge. Float voltage varies depending on battery type, i.e. flooded cells, gelled electrolyte, <b>absorbed</b> <b>glass</b> <b>mat</b> (AGM), and ranges from 1.8 V to 2.27 V. Equalization voltage, and charging voltage for sulfated cells, can range from 2.67 V to almost 3 V. (only until a charge current is flowing) Specific values for a given battery depend on the design and manufacturer recommendations, and are usually given at a baseline temperature of 20 C, requiring adjustment for ambient conditions.|$|R
5000|$|Battery {{electric}} vehicles (BEVs), {{also known as}} all-{{electric vehicles}} (AEVs), are electric vehicles whose main energy storage is in the chemical energy of batteries. BEVs {{are the most common}} form of what is defined by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) as zero emission vehicle (ZEV) because they produce no tailpipe emissions at the point of operation. The electrical energy carried on board a BEV to power the motors is obtained from a variety of battery chemistries arranged into battery packs. For additional range genset trailers or pusher trailers are sometimes used, forming a type of hybrid vehicle. Batteries used in electric vehicles include [...] "flooded" [...] lead-acid, <b>absorbed</b> <b>glass</b> <b>mat,</b> NiCd, nickel metal hydride, Li-ion, Li-poly and zinc-air batteries.|$|R
30|$|To {{prepare the}} NMO/CNT {{composite}} electrode, the slurry was first prepared by mixing with 80  wt% as-prepared sample, 10  wt% acetylene black, and 10  wt% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP). The above slurry was spread uniformly onto a carbon foil current collector and dried at 75  °C for 12  h. The above carbon foil and Zn metal foil were cut into circular disks with 15  mm in diameter as the cathode and anode, respectively. The solution containing 1  M Na 2 SO 4 and 0.5  M ZnSO 4 with the pH =  4 {{was used as}} the electrolyte, and <b>absorbed</b> <b>glass</b> <b>mat</b> (NSG Corporation) was applied as separator [27, 28]. 2025 coin-type batteries were assembled in air atmosphere before electrochemical tests. The charge/discharge cycling performance was investigated on a battery testing system (Neware, Shenzhen) in the potential range of 1 – 1.85  V (vs. Zn 2 +/Zn). Cyclic voltammetries (CVs) were carried out by the electrochemical workstation (Princeton, VersaSTAT 4) in the potential range of 1 – 2  V (vs. Zn 2 +/Zn). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed by using the electrochemical workstation (Princeton, VersaSTAT 4) in the frequency range of 0.01 – 100  kHz.|$|R

50|$|AGM {{batteries}} {{differ from}} flooded {{lead acid batteries}} in that the electrolyte is held in the <b>glass</b> <b>mats,</b> as opposed to freely flooding the plates. Very thin glass fibers are woven into a mat to increase surface area enough to hold sufficient electrolyte on the cells for their lifetime. The fibers that compose the fine <b>glass</b> <b>mat</b> do not <b>absorb</b> nor are they affected by the acidic electrolyte. These mats are wrung out 2-5% after being soaked in acids, prior to manufacture completion and sealing.|$|R

50|$|FRP (GRP): <b>Glass</b> <b>mats</b> in {{the form}} of chopped strand mat and woven roving is most common in hand lay-up method.

40|$|Abstract. Although {{addition}} of montmorillonite (MMT) clay to isotactic polypropylene (iPP) results in large {{increases in the}} melt viscosity at low shear rates, satisfactory impregnation of <b>glass</b> <b>mats</b> is obtained with iPP/MMT under conditions typical of industrial processing, and the MMT is well dispersed throughout the resulting composites. However, the MMT is also shown to retard relaxation of the <b>glass</b> <b>mat,</b> leading to non-uniform through-thickness glass fiber distributions. Thus, depending on the initial lay-up and hence on the initial surface fiber concentration, the bending modulus of the consolidated specimens may either increase or decrease with increasing matrix MMT content, whereas the tensile modulus remains consistent with the predictions of micromechanical models {{based on the assumption}} of a uniform glass fiber distribution. The presence of matrix-rich layers at surfaces of specimens containing MMT is also shown to promote crack initiation and induce premature failure in flexural tests...|$|R
