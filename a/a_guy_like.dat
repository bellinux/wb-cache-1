Conacher had been Kennedy's boyhood hero, but when Kennedy arrived Lorne Carr already wore No.9. Kennedy was initially given No.12, then switched to No. 10. When Kennedy heard Carr was retiring, he immediately {{wrote a letter to}} Leaf management requesting No.9. His Leaf team-mates had always teased Kennedy about his compulsion, so they contacted Conacher and arranged for the ceremony.

500|$|The next year, CTV, Canada's first private TV {{network and}} a fledgling {{competitor}} of his father's network, hired the 24-year-old Jennings as co-anchor of its late-night national newscast. While reporting for CTV, {{he was the}} first Canadian journalist to arrive in Dallas after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. In 1964, CTV sent Jennings to cover the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey. There, he ran into Elmer Lower, then president of ABC News, who offered him a job as a correspondent for the American network, an opportunity Jennings initially rejected. [...] "The job was pretty intimidating for <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>like</b> me in a tiny city in Canada," [...] Jennings later recalled. [...] "I thought, What if I screw up? What if I fail?"

500|$|Known as {{an outspoken}} player, Hull earned a {{reputation}} {{on and off the}} ice for speaking bluntly and without regard for whom it might offend. [...] He chastised his own fans in 1992 – later backtracking – when they booed Adam Oates following Oates' trade request, calling them [...] "losers" [...] and stating he wanted to rip one particular fan's head off. Hull was a consistent critic of the NHL's defensive, [...] "clutch and grab" [...] era of the late 1990s, raising the ire of commissioner Gary Bettman in 1998 when he said [...] "I wouldn't pay to watch. It's boring. The whole style of the game is terrible. There's no flow. When <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>like</b> [...] Lemieux leaves the game and tells you why he's leaving, and you don't address it, that's stupid. But the players don't say crap.

Criss stated that, although he identifies as straight, [...] "it really doesn't come into play with me in this role. As an actor, your objective is always to play the scene. And this in case, he happens to be a gay teen." [...] Talk show host and media personality Ellen DeGeneres deemed Blaine [...] "a very confident gay teen, which is something you don't see much on television." [...] However, Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times assessed that [...] "despite the image he projects, he, too, is just a kid trying to figure things out as he goes along."

Series writer Blythe Robe commented on Izzie and Denny: [...] "I love the way Izzie lights up when she's around him.

500|$|During the off-season, the Capitals {{made several}} player changes. One {{of the players}} that was not {{retained}} by the team, Matt Bradley, started a controversy with his comments from a radio interview in Ottawa. In the interview, Bradley said his former team was [...] "a little bit too nonchalant and guys weren’t disciplined the way they should have been," [...] which he claimed were the two biggest reasons why the team {{was not able to}} advance past {{the second round of the}} Stanley Cup playoffs. He later stated that Head Coach Bruce Boudreau did not give the most ice time to players who were playing well, but went with his star players. He further noted that Boudreau was a [...] "great coach" [...] who had been put in a tough position. When asked to point out examples, Bradley stated that Alexander Semin [...] "could easily be the best player in the league," [...] but he [...] "just doesn’t care," [...] further noting, [...] "When you've got <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>like</b> that, you need him to be your best player, or one of your best players, and when he doesn't show up, you almost get the sense that he wants to be back in Russia."

[...] Teammate Mike Knuble noted that because Semin speaks limited English, the language barrier affects the way that he is perceived, further noting that the interview comments were something Bradley regretted.

500|$|After graduating, Hedlund {{signed with}} the Trenton Titans of the East Coast Hockey League for the final games of the 2001–02 season. He played in two games as a rookie and did not record a stat during the regular season, but in six playoff games he spent six minutes in the penalty box. In the 2002–03 season, he played in 13 games for Trenton {{recording}} a goal and two assists before he was called up to the American Hockey League's Binghamton Senators. In Binghamton, he played in 59 games scoring one goal and adding seven assists. On January 16, 2004, against the Albany River Rats, Hedlund broke a 17-game streak {{in which he had}} gone scoreless after he recorded his first career overtime goal and his second career game-winner. His previous goal was a game-winning shot against Syracuse. He ended the 2003–04 season with four goals and 19 assists in 80 games. Before the 2004–05 season, Hedlund spent time in training camp with the Ottawa Senators before he was reassigned to Binghamton. The NHL season would eventually be locked out which saw players such as goaltender Dominik Hašek join the AHL. When Hasek began working out with Binghamton, Hedlund commented, [...] "He's just one of the guys when he's here, he just wants to put in his time and get some good work in, and make sure he's ready to go, so you just got to appreciate <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>like</b> that being here and doing that kind of work, so its pretty fun." [...] A season preview produced by the website Hockey's Future commented about Hedlund saying that, [...] "A fan-favorite, Hedlund gives it everything he has despite limited talent." [...] Against the Manitoba Moose on October 31, Hedlund scored a goal from the blue line that tied the game, however the Senators ended up losing 5–3. Following the season, he and Philadelphia Phantoms player Ben Stafford were named the AHL's Men of the Year. During the season he played in 75 games, scoring two goals with 13 assists.

2500|$|After his {{football}} career ended, Ortmann accepted {{a job with}} a Chicago nonferrous metals company owned by former Michigan All-American Ernie Vick.

During the Rams' first year, Larry Krupp served as student manager of the team. In 2004, Ortmann was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor.

2500|$|Writer Ştefan Agopian, who met Cioculescu {{during the}} 1980s, {{recalled}} that the literary community was puzzled {{as to why}} Cioculescu himself was not arrested, and claims that his rescue was largely owed to Paul Georgescu, who secretly harbored anti-Stalinist convictions of his own. Agopian cites Georgescu saying: [...] "He had done nothing wrong, so he was still usable, we {{could not afford to}} lose <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>like</b> Cioculescu just so we could have our prisons filled. Cioculescu's luck was that the idiots upstairs listened to me." [...] However, according to the account of comparatist Matei Călinescu, who was then working for Gazeta Literară, Georgescu took personal part in censoring Cioculescu's work: in one such case, Cioculescu had written a political text on the occasion of May Day, believing that the Party was requesting a sign of loyalty from him, but unaware that authors with few political credentials were in fact barred from publishing around national holidays. According to this account, Georgescu was infuriated by his subordinate's action, and made a point of disavowing it publicly—an attitude linked by him with Georgescu's dogmatism. According to Agopian, this was nevertheless a subtle attempt to prevent Cioculescu from discrediting his name by associating it with communist messages.|$|E

Anderson's high school coach Bob Hurley said, [...] "I think he's a modern-day Magic Johnson. I think that let him play the point. He gets everybody shots. You don’t have him back defensively balancing the floor, you’re wasting him. But you let him {{do a lot of}} what the point guard stuff entails. But then also defensively you don’t bother guarding him on the little guy. Put him on maybe the three man or even sometimes the four man if he’s a step-out player.

This, Călinescu writes, was a [...] "cynical lesson" [...] in how to use ideological texts as [...] "a verbal package with a minimal content." [...] In reference to Cioculescu and his potential arrest, Agopian cited Georgescu saying: [...] "He had done nothing wrong, so he was still usable, we could not afford to lose <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>like</b> Cioculescu just so we could have our prisons filled. Cioculescu's luck was that the idiots upstairs listened to me."

In addition, Călinescu cites Georgescu's reference to those writers who gave in to pressures and accepted to contribute propaganda as having paid their [...] "entrance to the circus", as well as his belief that [...] "keeping a private diary today [...] is the equivalent of a denunciation." [...] In Radu Cosaşu's account, although a [...] "dogmatic Marxist", his older friend saw no link between the ideology and Socialist Realist guidelines, and never pressured him to write [...] "for the party", while Dimisianu discusses Georgescu's [...] "generosity" [...] and [...] "warmth" [...] in respect to his friends and disciples.|$|E
2500|$|On August 7, 2001, the APEC {{report was}} issued by Judge Ted Hughes, which cleared Chrétien of wrongdoing, but stated that Jean Carle of the PMO had {{improperly}} pressured the RCMP {{to attack the}} protesters. Hughes concluded that the RCMP had used excessive force that was {{in violation of the}} Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Hughes ruled that the use of force by the RCMP had gone beyond the legitimate security need to protect the visiting leaders at the APEC summit, and was intended to silence the protests altogether, which thus violated the right to freedom of expression guaranteed to all Canadians by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Judge Hughes accused Carle of [...] "throwing his weight around" [...] and attempting to interfere with security arrangements. Lawrence Martin expressed some skepticism about Judge Hughes's report, asking if were really possible for Carle, who was Chrétien's chief of operations at the PMO in 1997 and was someone who was especially close to Chrétien, to be directing the RCMP to attack protesters without the Prime Minister knowing. One Liberal later recalled about the Carle-Chrétien relationship that: [...] "I don't know why Chrétien kept <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>like</b> him around. He was always getting him in trouble". Shortly after the Hughes report was issued, Carle became chief of operations at the Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal, which promptly received a doubling of federal sponsorship money by the Public Works ministry headed by Alfonso Gagliano, and then a rare retroactive grant of $100,000. Chrétien and Gagliano both denied that Carle's presence {{had anything to do with}} the increased grants. In December 2001, the RMCP raided the home of François Beaudoin to investigate alleged wrongdoing that Beaudoin was said to have committed during his time as president of the Business Development Bank of Canada, which the opposition charged was part of an attempt to intimidate Beaudoin for suing for wrongful dismissal. The Solicitor General Lawrence MacAulay rejected claims that government was pursuing a vendetta against Beaudoin, and accused opposition members of trying to smear the RCMP.|$|E
