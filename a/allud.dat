40|$|Tudor domain-containing protein 3, TDRD 3, {{was first}} {{identified}} in a proteomic {{survey of the}} spliceosome machinery. Although its function remains elusive, elevated TDRD 3 gene expression is associated with poor prognosis of estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer. The Tudor domain of TDRD 3 is highly similar to the Tudor domain of the survival of motor neuron (SMN) and accordingly, {{it has been shown}} to bind dimethylated arginine residues. Our lab has previously demonstrated the association of TDRD 3 with the translation machinery and most importantly, its localization to stress granules (SG) upon various cellular stresses. In this study, it was revealed that TDRD 3 knockdown facilitates and accelerates SG assembly and consequently accelerates SG disassembly. Moreover, we showed that wildtype TDRD 3 rescued this defect while a mutation in the Tudor domain of TDRD 3, E 691 K, was not able to do so. Taken together, these findings <b>allud...</b>|$|E
