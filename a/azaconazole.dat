40|$|The {{effect of}} {{pretreatment}} of Douglas-fir flakes with CCA-C, borate, and <b>azaconazole</b> on properties of flakeboard was studied. Flakes had higher retention levels of CCA-C and borate in their ends than in their centers. The distribution of chemicals was uniform in panels, {{which indicates that}} the chemicals did not migrate during hot-pressing. Treatment markedly enhanced resistance to brown rot (Postia placenta). Borate-treated panels had large thickness swelling and often delaminated when exposed to hot, wet conditions. In static bending and internal bond tests, strength reduction for borate- and CCAC-treated panels was evident. <b>Azaconazole</b> showed no deleterious effect on strength...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] lumber was {{converted}} to flakes, which were dip treated with three concentrations each of copper chrome arsenate Type C (CCA-C), and {{disodium octaborate tetrahydrate}} (TIM-BOR). <b>Azaconazole</b> [1 -[2 -(2, 4 -dichloropheny 1) - 1, 3 - dioxolan- 2 -ylmethyl]- 1 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazole] was used as powder. The flakeboard panels (305 x 304 x 13 mm) were made using phenolformaldehyde powdered resin and wax. Distribution of CCA and TIM-BOR in treated flakes and panels was examined using x-ray fluorescence and titration methods. Concentrations were greater in the ends of flakes than in the center. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDXA) showed that CCA distribution was quite uniform on the surfaces examined. Concentrations of CCA and TIM-BOR in selected panel zones were uniform, indicating that the chemicals did not migrate significantly during panel manufacture. Distribution of <b>azaconazole</b> was not examined because a reliable method was not available. In water leaching test. CCA and <b>azaconazole</b> {{were found to be}} resistant to leaching, while TIM-BOR was not. Samples were tested for decay resistance using the soil block and vermiculite burial tests. Trametes versicolor, a white rot fungus, and Phialophora heteromorpha, a soft rot fungus, caused very low weight losses and did not appear to actively colonize even the untreated controls. Postia placenta, a brown rot fungus, caused substantial weight losses in untreated controls. With the latter fungus, CCA performed better than <b>azaconazole</b> and TIM-BOR, producing the lowest weight loss. The highest weight losses were associated with TIM-BOR, although some of the weight loss may have resulted from leaching during the decay test. The effect of each test chemical on dimensional stability, static bending and internal bond (IB) properties of treated panel was evaluated. When exposed to hot wet conditions, TIM-BOR treated samples had large thickness swell compared to CCA and <b>azaconazole,</b> and often delaminated. Samples placed in hot dry conditions had very small dimensional changes over time. In static bending and internal bond tests, strength reductions for TIM-BOR and CCA treated samples were clearly evident; however, reductions for TIM-BOR treated panels were greater than those for CCA. <b>Azaconazole</b> showed no deleterious effect on strength and generally performed well. A discussion of needs for future research is included. Those include a fundamental understanding of the interaction of preservative chemical within flakes and mats prior to pressing, during pressing, and in service. In addition, the need to establish more appropriate means {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} treatment is identified Environmental safety, both during processing and in-service, is also identified as an important factor...|$|E
40|$|Hyphal {{fragments}} and protoplasts of two wood-degrading fungi, Postia placenta and Trametes versicolor, {{were used to}} examine the effects of two fungicides, copper sulfate and <b>azaconazole,</b> on fungal health (as measured by oxygen consumption, glucose utilization, potassium levels, cell regeneration, and copper uptake). Although both cell systems responded to the presence of fungicide, there were some differences in response. Protoplasts tended to absorb higher levels of copper and were less sensitive to copper sulfate than were mycelial fragments. In general, however, protoplasts provided uniform cells for evaluating the effects of fungicides on cell health...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} the synthesis, characterization {{and application of}} new graphene-based silica coated magnetic nanoparticles (Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 –G) for the simultaneous preconcentration of four chlorinated pesticides namely lindane, chlorpyrifos, hexaconazole and <b>azaconazole</b> from contaminated water. The newly synthesised adsorbent was characterized using FT-IR spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Chlorinated pesticide extraction efficiency of the Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 –G was evaluated through magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) using gas chromatography with a micro electron capture detector (GC-μECD). Experimental parameters, i. e., desorption solvent, solvent volume, extraction time, desorption time, sample volume, adsorbent dosage and solution pH were optimized. Compared to commercial C 18 sorbent and Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2, the newly synthesized Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 –G adsorbent showed a linear response (1 – 100 pg mL− 1), low limits of detection (0. 12 – 0. 28 pg mL− 1) and high adsorption capacity (13. 04 – 18. 69 mg g− 1) with a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0. 999. Environmental water samples {{were used to assess}} the field applicability of the adsorbents. Excellent percent recovery (80. 8 – 106. 3 %) was achieved for Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 –G at pH 6. 5. The results showed that the newly synthesized Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 –G is an efficient adsorbent with good potential for the preconcentration of selected chlorinated pesticides from aqueous media...|$|E
