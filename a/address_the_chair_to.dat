40|$|We {{study the}} {{computational}} {{complexity of the}} problem of controlling the result of an election by breaking ties. When <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> is only asked to break ties to choose between one of the co-winners, the problem is trivially easy. However, in multi-round elections like STV, we prove that it can be NP-hard for <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> compute how to break ties to ensure a given result. Our results contain several surprises. For example, whilst it is NP-hard to compute a ma-nipulating vote for a multi-round rule like Nanson, it is polynomial for <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> control <b>the</b> result by breaking ties. As a second example, it can be NP-hard to control an election by breaking ties even with a simple two-stage voting rule. ...|$|R
