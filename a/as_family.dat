In many cultures, there are strong social and emotional bonds between humans and their dogs {{that can be seen}} <b>as</b> <b>family</b> members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.|$|E

5|$|Also on {{show is a}} late 19th-century shambar (large veil) from Bayt Jibrin worn at {{weddings and}} festivals. It is made of {{embroidered}} handwoven black silk with a separate heavy red silk fringe. A woman wore the shambar mainly on her wedding day, positioned so that when she covered her face the embroidered end would show. Another item in the collection is a headdress (iraqiyeh) embroidered with cross-stitch and decorated with Ottoman coins minted in AH 1223 (1808), as well as Maria Theresa coins. The iraqiyeh was worn by married women and elaborate pieces were passed down <b>as</b> <b>family</b> heirlooms. Long embroidered headbands made of cotton hanging from both sides were wrapped around the woman's braids to facilitate the bundling of her hair, then secured {{to the back of}} the headdress.|$|E
5|$|It was de Jussieu in 1789 {{who first}} {{formally}} created a 'family' (Narcissi), as the seventh 'Ordo' (Order) {{of the third}} class (Stamina epigyna) of Monocots in which Narcissus and 15 other genera were placed. The {{use of the term}} Ordo at that time was closer to what we now understand <b>as</b> <b>Family,</b> rather than Order. The family has undergone much reorganisation since then, but in 1805 it was renamed after a different genus in the family, Amaryllis, as 'Amaryllideae' by Jaume St.-Hilaire and has retained that association since. Jaume St.-Hilaire divided the family into two unnamed sections and recognised five species of Narcissus, omitting N. serotinus.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan T. Leete had captained the {{schooner}} Reaper, {{owned by}} James Frisbie, and crewed {{by a man}} of East Asian origin, John Canoe, commonly known as Jackalow, short for John Low or John Lord. After Jonathan gave up command of the Reaper, he and Jackalow worked on Jonathan's father's farm on Sachem's Head in Guilford, Connecticut, where Jackalow was regarded <b>as</b> <b>family.</b> At some point, while in New York, Jackalow had stolen $100 from Jonathan and fled to New Haven. He was returned to New York by the police, but Jonathan refused to testify against him and rehired him. Jonathan and his brother Elijah J. Leete subsequently bought the 30-ton sloop Spray, {{funded in part by}} a mortgage their father took out on his farm. Jonathan (the captain), Elijah, and Jackalow sailed the Spray together for two or three years. By March 1860, Jackalow had sailed with Jonathan for four years.|$|E

5|$|Siglas Poveiras are {{a form of}} proto-writing system, with a {{restricted}} number of symbols that were combined to form more complex symbols; these were used as a rudimentary visual communication system, and as a signature to mark belongings. Merchants wrote them in their books of credit; fishermen used it in religious rituals by marking them {{in the door of}} Catholic chapels near hills or beaches; in the table of the church during marriage and in their tombstone; and also had magical significance, such as the São Selimão sigla, that {{could be used as a}} protecting symbol and not <b>as</b> <b>family</b> mark. Children used the same family mark with piques as a form of cadency. The youngest son would not have any pique and would inherit his father's symbol. The siglas are still used, though much less commonly, by some families; and are related with Viking traditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitution}} of the Order of Canada states that the insignia remain property of the Crown, and requires {{any member of the}} order to return to the chancellery their original emblem should they be upgraded within the order to a higher rank. Thus, while badges may be passed down <b>as</b> <b>family</b> heirlooms, or loaned or donated for display in museums, they cannot be sold by any individual other than the monarch with the proper advice and consent of her ministers. Over the decades, however, a number of Order of Canada insignia have been put up for sale, the first being the Companion's badge of Major Coldwell, who was appointed in 1967; his badge was sold at auction in 1981, an act that received criticism from government officials.|$|E
