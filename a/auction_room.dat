25|$|The look of {{the square}} changed very much during the second decade of the 19th century, when its two most {{prominent}} buildings were constructed. In 1817 local merchants raised money by public subscription to construct a building to house the Exchange and Commercial Library. In 1807, Gibraltar merchants had founded a library in Bedlam Court, as they were denied membership of the Garrison Library, it being available only {{to members of the}} British garrison in the city (the Garrison Library functioned not only as a library, but as a club, owned and run by and for military officers; civilians were excluded, regardless of their prominence). Ten years later, in 1817, they built themselves a new building {{on the east side of}} the square, thus separating it from Main Street. It housed, not only a library, but also an <b>auction</b> <b>room</b> and became the meeting place of local merchants. In 1951, the building was refurbished to host the Legislative Council, which in 1969 become the House of Assembly. Since 2006, the building hosts the Gibraltar Parliament.|$|E

In 1932, {{on the occasion}} of the harbour's 25th anniversary, Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen's statue of the fisherman and lifeboatman was unveiled. In 1935, Johannes Friis-Skotte, Minister for Transport, announced that the government were funding a 900,000 kr project to expand the harbour [...] towards the east, involving a [...] by [...] basin with a depth of , designed to facilitate fisherman during the process of unloading. As a result, between 1935 and 1938 the harbour was expanded towards the east, and a new <b>auction</b> <b>room</b> was added in 1938, [...] in length and [...] wide, with skylights and seven phone booths.|$|E

500|$|In 1943, the Rigsdag {{approved}} 7 million kr {{proposals to}} further expand the harbour towards the west. However, {{due to the}} German occupation during the war the project was postponed and it wasn't until 1952 that construction began, rising to a budget of 11 million kr. The off-shore area of the port was expanded by [...] and the on-shore area was enlarged by , with some [...] of quay. Between 1964 and 1979 the harbour was further expanded towards the east in a 35 million kr project to facilitate growth at the port, doubling {{the size of the}} harbour and providing new facilities for auctioning the catches from the 400 fishing boats registered in Skagen. The off-shore area was enlarged by 14 hectares and the on-shore area with 120 hectares. A new <b>auction</b> <b>room</b> was erected between the fisheries inspection building and the auction office. In 1985, the Auktionsbassin [...] (the Auction Basin) of the port was deepened by some , as was the Vesthavnen (West Harbour) in the early 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|This is the practice, {{especially}} by high-end art auctioneers, of raising false bids at crucial {{times in the}} bidding {{in order to create}} the appearance of greater demand or to extend bidding momentum for a work on offer. To call out these nonexistent bids auctioneers might fix their gaze at a point in the <b>auction</b> <b>room</b> that is difficult for the audience to pin down. The practice is frowned upon in the industry. In the United States, chandelier bidding is not illegal. In fact, an auctioneer may bid up the price of an item to the reserve price, which is an unstated amount the consignor will not sell the item for. [...] However, the auction house is required to disclose this information.|$|E
2500|$|The Green Room {{was shot}} in the fall of 1977 in Honfleur, France with a budget of 3 million francs {{provided}} by United Artists. That summer, Truffaut scouted locations and hired his longtime collaborator, Néstor Almendros, as cinematographer. To give the film a Gothic look, Almendros used candle light as both source and practical lighting, with electrical lights used to [...] "exploit the contrast between electric light and a flood of candlelight to give the film a ghostly quality." [...] Truffaut also intended a resulting lack of colour throughout filming, condemning colour as a removal of the final [...] "barrier" [...] between film and reality: [...] "If there is nothing false in a film, then it is not a film." [...] Almendros later said that, despite the film's somber tone, [...] "this film was put together with joy, and the shooting was the most pleasant" [...] of his career. Many of the scenes were shot in the four-story Maison Troublet in Honfleur. This house and its grounds included sets for many of the film's main locations: Davenne's house, his office at The Globe and the <b>auction</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E

60|$|He sighed drowsily. The {{atmosphere}} of the <b>auction</b> <b>room</b> was close; you weren't allowed to smoke; and altogether {{he was beginning to}} regret that he had come. The service continued. Objects of varying unattractiveness came and went, eulogised by the officiating priest, but coldly received by the congregation. Relations between the former and the latter were growing more and more distant. The congregation seemed to suspect the priest of having an ulterior motive in his eulogies, and the priest seemed to suspect the congregation of a frivolous desire to waste his time. He had begun to speculate openly as to why they were there at all. Once, when a particularly repellent statuette of a nude female with an unwholesome green skin had been offered at two dollars and had found no bidders--the congregation appearing silently grateful for his statement that it was the only specimen of its kind on the continent--he had specifically accused them of having come into the <b>auction</b> <b>room</b> merely with the purpose of sitting down and taking the weight off their feet.|$|E

60|$|At length Mr. Winkle {{began to}} dream {{that he was}} at a club, and that the members being very refractory, the {{chairman}} was obliged to hammer the table a good deal to preserve order; then he had a confused notion of an <b>auction</b> <b>room</b> where there were no bidders, and the auctioneer was buying everything in; and ultimately he began to think it just within the bounds of possibility that somebody might be knocking at the street door. To make quite certain, however, he remained quiet in bed for ten minutes or so, and listened; and when he had counted two or three-and-thirty knocks, he felt quite satisfied, and gave himself a great deal of credit for being so wakeful.|$|E
60|$|When {{he entered}} the Art Galleries a few minutes later, Archie was glad of the moral support of even such a wobbly reed as Reggie van Tuyl. There is {{something}} about an <b>auction</b> <b>room</b> which weighs heavily upon the novice. The hushed interior was bathed in a dim, religious light; and the congregation, seated on small wooden chairs, gazed in reverent silence at the pulpit, where a gentleman of commanding presence and sparkling pince-nez was delivering a species of chant. Behind a gold curtain {{at the end of}} the room mysterious forms flitted to and fro. Archie, who had been expecting something on the lines of the New York Stock Exchange, which he had once been privileged to visit when it was in a more than usually feverish mood, found the atmosphere oppressively ecclesiastical. He sat down and looked about him. The presiding priest went on with his chant.|$|E

You could count upon a half hour's diversion with it at faro {{in one of the}} fortified art galleries. It would furnish an education to an ambitious boy. I am told that a genuine Corot was secured for that amount in an <b>auction</b> <b>room</b> yesterday. You could move to a New Hampshire town and live respectably two years on it.

6000|$|He {{was not a}} bad fellow when in good fortune, this Altamont. He {{ordered a}} smart livery for Grady, and made poor old Costigan shed tears of quickly dried {{gratitude}} by giving him a five-pound note after a snug dinner at the Back Kitchen, and he bought a green shawl for Mrs. Bolton, and a yellow one for Fanny: the most brilliant [...] "sacrifices" [...] of a Regent Street haberdasher's window. And a short time after this, upon her birthday, which happened {{in the month of}} June, Miss Amory received from [...] "a friend" [...] a parcel containing an enormous brass inlaid writing-desk, in which there was a set of amethysts, the most hideous eyes ever looked upon,--a musical snuff-box, and two Keepsakes of the year before last, and accompanied with a couple of gown pieces of the most astounding colours, the receipt of which goods made the Sylphide laugh and wonder immoderately. Now {{it is a fact that}} Colonel Altamont had made a purchase of cigars and French silks from some duffers in Fleet Street about this period; and he was found by Strong in the open <b>Auction</b> <b>Room</b> in Cheapside, having invested some money in two desks, several pairs of richly-plated candlesticks, a dinner epergne, and a bagatelle-board.
