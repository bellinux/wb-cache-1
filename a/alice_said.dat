500|$|In {{his book}} Game Plan: Great Designs that Changed the Face of Computer Gaming, British video game {{journalist}} Ste Curran wrote that Broken Sword influenced the adventure games Toonstruck, in which Cecil has a [...] "Special Thanks" [...] credit, and Escape from Monkey Island, {{which features a}} puzzle that involves a broken sword. Kevin Bruner, co-founder of Telltale Games, {{has said that he}} is a Broken Sword fan. Ashton Raze, a writer for The Telegraph and the co-creator of the 2013 adventure game Richard & <b>Alice,</b> <b>said</b> that Broken Sword is his biggest influence. In his review of the 2010 adventure game Deponia, Declan Skews of Video Games Interactive said that the game drew inspiration from Broken Sword.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I suppose you'd be {{over when}} that was done,' <b>Alice</b> <b>said</b> thoughtfully: 'but don't {{you think it would}} be rather hard?' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Alice</b> <b>said</b> nothing: she {{had never}} been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.|$|E
6000|$|<b>ALICE.</b> 'Amy <b>said</b> {{she had a}} {{headache}} and went to bed. I spoke to her through the door before I came out, but she wouldn't answer.' ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Alice</b> Walker <b>said</b> of the book, [...] "It {{has been}} reverberating in {{me to an}} {{astonishing}} degree. I love it passionately, could not possibly exist without it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} I shall never see that," [...] <b>Alice</b> Hardy <b>said,</b> [...] "but I am quite content with Milan; I could stop {{here for a}} month." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Alice</b> <b>said</b> nothing; she had {{sat down}} with {{her face in her}} hands, {{wondering}} if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I was thinking,' <b>Alice</b> <b>said</b> very politely, 'which is {{the best}} way out of this wood: it's getting so dark. Would you tell me, please?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I won't be {{introduced}} to the pudding, please,' <b>Alice</b> <b>said</b> rather hastily, 'or we shall get no dinner at all. May I give you some?' ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Alice</b> Haldeman <b>said</b> that [...] "with {{the last}} words he ever spoke he asked me not to leave the bank," [...] thus {{crediting}} him in part with her own illustrious career.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Alice</b> Deringham <b>said</b> {{nothing further}} upon the subject until Alton joined {{them as they}} sat out on the {{verandah}} that night. [...] "You are not pleased with me?" [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|I {{laughed at}} the warning, though I had {{occasion}} to remember it, and looking for <b>Alice</b> I <b>said,</b> [...] "I am driving in to church to-night. Would {{you like to come}} with me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Much more {{smoothly}} than a live horse,' <b>Alice</b> <b>said,</b> {{with a little}} scream of laughter, {{in spite of all}} she could do to prevent it.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Alice</b> <b>said,</b> as gravely as she could, 'They {{might go}} {{different}} ways.' But she couldn't help thinking to herself, 'What dreadful nonsense we ARE talking!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think I should {{understand}} that better,' <b>Alice</b> <b>said</b> very politely, 'if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Alice</b> Deringham <b>said</b> nothing, {{but though}} she smiled Seaforth fancied {{that she was}} not pleased. Her {{thoughts}} were, however, of small importance to him, and he hastened fuming with impatience towards the stables.|$|R
5000|$|The {{title of}} the teen novel Go Ask <b>Alice</b> (author <b>said</b> to be Beatrice Sparks), is taken from the {{psychedelic}} song by Jefferson Airplane, [...] "White Rabbit", which took major imagery from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.|$|R
5000|$|... "Alright," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Alice,</b> [...] "I'm going back... To {{the other}} side of the mirror." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Only {{it is so}} VERY lonely here!' <b>Alice</b> <b>said</b> in {{a melancholy}} voice; and {{at the thought of}} her {{loneliness}} two large tears came rolling down her cheeks.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{cause of}} lightning,' <b>Alice</b> <b>said</b> very decidedly, for she felt quite certain about this, 'is the thunder--no, no!' she hastily {{corrected}} herself. 'I meant the other way.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed I shan't!' <b>Alice</b> <b>said</b> rather impatiently. 'I don't {{belong to}} this railway journey at all--I {{was in a}} wood just now--and I wish I could get back there.' ...|$|E
5000|$|... “A cannae explain maesel, A’m feart, Sir,” <b>said</b> <b>Alice,</b> “baecaas A’m naw maesel, yae see.” ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Alice</b> {{apparently}} <b>said</b> of {{her husband}} [...] "Charlie Williamson could do {{anything in the world}} except write stories": she said of herself [...] "I can't do anything else." [...] She continued to write after her husband's death in 1920.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Alice</b> Deringham <b>said</b> {{nothing for}} a space, and then her voice was different. There was no shade of {{expression}} in it. [...] "And you {{are going back to}} look for the silver tomorrow? I hope you will be successful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, sir," [...] <b>Alice</b> <b>said,</b> {{more and}} more surprised, [...] "what message could {{possibly}} be of sufficient importance for you to undertake so long a journey to deliver it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't {{know that}} I mean that," [...] <b>Alice</b> <b>said</b> carelessly; [...] "but I {{do not always}} {{understand}} what you mean, though I always understand what you say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Never mind!' <b>Alice</b> <b>said</b> in a {{soothing}} tone, and stooping {{down to the}} daisies, who were just beginning again, she whispered, 'If you don't hold your tongues, I'll pick you!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Alice.</b> [...] "Mamma <b>said</b> {{you told}} her they were here." [...] Mrs. Brinkley {{reassured}} herself from this; Miss Van Hook's name had rather slipped out; but of course Mrs. Pasmer had not repeated {{what she had said}} about Dan in this connection. [...] "I wish I could have seen Julia," [...] Alice went on. [...] "It would have been quite like Campobello again." ...|$|R
500|$|... "The {{question}} is," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Alice,</b> [...] "whether you {{can make}} words mean so many different things." ...|$|R
6000|$|To the Looking-Glass {{world it}} was <b>Alice</b> that <b>said,</b> [...] "I've a sceptre in hand, I've a crown on my head; [...] Let the Looking-Glass creatures, {{whatever}} they be, [...] Come and dine with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me!"] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You silly old man," [...] <b>Alice</b> <b>said,</b> kissing him, [...] "as if we {{were not}} just as anxious to get home and {{to get to the}} bottom of the thing as you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It CAN'T go straight, you know, if you pin {{it all on}} one side,' <b>Alice</b> <b>said,</b> as {{she gently}} put it right for her; 'and, dear me, what a state your hair is in!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How {{is it you}} can {{all talk}} so nicely?' <b>Alice</b> <b>said,</b> hoping to get it into a better temper by a compliment. 'I've been in many gardens before, {{but none of the}} flowers could talk.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ever {{since you}} told me the whole story, I have lain awake at night {{thinking}} it over. It may be that what <b>Alice</b> has <b>said</b> may have turned my thoughts that way, but I can see only two explanations of the affair.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There {{was a child}} called <b>Alice</b> Marwood,' <b>said</b> the daughter, with a laugh, {{and looking}} down at herself in terrible derision of herself, 'born, among poverty and neglect, and nursed in it. Nobody taught her, nobody stepped forward to help her, nobody cared for her.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Alice</b> Deringham <b>said</b> nothing, but Mrs. Forel saw {{the blood}} creep into the {{polished}} whiteness of her neck, and wished {{that she would}} look up. The girl's rigid stillness was, she fancied, a trifle unnatural, and suggested {{that there was a}} good deal behind it.|$|R
