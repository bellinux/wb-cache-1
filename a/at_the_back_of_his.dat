5|$|Nosek's other friend Ondřej Vlach {{testified that}} Nosek's fall {{happened}} in a break {{between the end of}} concert and the encore. Nosek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage. According to him, Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off. While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage, Nosek fell directly on the ground. According to Vlach, there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break. Vlach further testified that after the fall, Nosek went to sit on a bench, where he was fetched a water bottle. Nosek began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a bulge <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head, they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion. Vlach said that he understood Blythe's gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began on}} 23 June as the English army {{attempted}} to force {{its way across}} the high ground of the Bannock Burn, which was surrounded by marshland. Skirmishing between the two sides broke out, resulting in the death of Sir Henry de Bohun, whom Robert killed in personal combat. Edward continued his advance the following day, and encountered the bulk of the Scottish army as they emerged from the woods of New Park. Edward appears not to have expected the Scots to give battle here, and as a result had kept his forces in marching, rather than battle, order, with the archers − who would usually have been used to break up enemy spear formations − <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army, rather than the front. His cavalry found it hard to operate in the cramped terrain and were crushed by Robert's spearmen. The English army was overwhelmed and its leaders were unable to regain control.|$|E

A post-mortem analysis disclosed that Aquino was shot in the back of the head at close range with the bullet exiting at the chin at a downward angle, which supported Quijano's testimony.

500|$|Ryan Robbins plays Henry Foss, {{who runs}} the Sanctuary's {{computer}} and security systems. The producers wanted Henry to set a lighter tone to the series and add [...] "goofy and fun" [...] humor, including in somewhat dire situations. The producers cast Robbins, and were pleased with his performance. Chuck Campbell plays [...] "two-faced guy", a character with another face <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head. The back face was accomplished using visual effects. Panou plays Sylvio, an associate of Ashley's. The character was originally named Ernie and was played by director Peter DeLuise in the webisodes, but he was unavailable to reshoot his scenes for the season premiere. Jonathon Young stars as Nikola Tesla. Heyerdahl suggested Young to the producers, who ended up being highly impressed by his performance. Young also played Tesla in a one-man show before appearing in the series. Whilst filming {{the second part of}} [...] "Revelations", Young's scenes in the underground city were filmed first, as he was scheduled for another play while the episode was shot.|$|E

His solicitor, meanwhile, claimed later that they were found by the defence team in Adams's surgery shortly before trial. This differs from the police records: in the list of exhibits for the Committal Hearing given to the DPP's office, the notes are mentioned. Cullen suggests that Attorney General therefore must have known they existed. and according to her, this shows [...] "that there was a will at the highest of levels to undermine the case against Dr Adams".|$|E

[...] A {{neighboring}} property owner heard a single gunshot on the afternoon of July 13 and discovered Ringo's body the following day. [...] His feet were wrapped in strips of cloth torn from his undershirt, probably because his horse had gotten loose from its picket and bolted with his boots tied to the saddle—a method commonly used at that time to keep scorpions out of them. [...] There was a bullet hole in his right temple and an exit wound <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head.
