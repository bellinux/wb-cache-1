An auxiliary support ship, Montford Points role would be a seagoing pier for friendly forces in case accessibility to onshore bases are denied. Such flexibility would be useful following natural disasters and for supporting US Marines once they are ashore. The ESD supports a vehicle staging area, side port ramp, large mooring fenders, and up to three landing craft air cushioned vessel lanes.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a current}} {{need for the}} {{development}} of new computational tools to model the seakeeping performance of <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicles</b> in support of the US Navy’s Landing Craft <b>Air</b> <b>Cushion</b> (LCAC) Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) and possibly {{the development of a new}} connector as part of the Joint Maritime Assault Connector (JMAC) program. Much of the existing simulation capability for <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicles</b> was developed in the 1960 ’s, 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s to support the design of the LCAC and are coefficient-based models derived from small-scale experiments. The general utility of these simulations is limited in the design of new <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicles,</b> especially for innovative concepts or new components for increased performance capability. Advances in computing power and algorithms for free surface flows have made possible the development of new simulation tools to quantitatively assess design modifications and complement model tests of <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In this paper we describe the formulation, implementation and verification of a new computational model, called ACVSIM, to simulate the dynamics of <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicles</b> operating in waves. The primary components of ACVSIM include a high-order Rankine panel method for the hydrodynamic solution, an immersed boundary model for the solution of the <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> dynamics, and a structural dynamics model of the bag-and-finger skirt system. Several semi-empirical models for other force components, such as the aerodynamic drag, are planned for a future release of the code...|$|R
