25|$|Due to {{the heavy}} human populations and high level of {{industrialization}} along its shores, the wildlife of the North Sea has suffered from pollution, overhunting, and overfishing. Flamingos and pelicans were once found along the southern shores of the North Sea, but became extinct over the 2nd millennium. Walruses frequented the Orkney Islands through the mid-16th century, as both Sable Island and Orkney Islands lay within its normal range. Gray whales also resided in the North Sea but were driven to extinction in the Atlantic in the 17th century Other species have dramatically declined in population, though they are still found. North Atlantic right whales, sturgeon, shad, rays, skates, salmon, and other species were common in the North Sea until the 20th century, when numbers declined due to overfishing.

2500|$|The use of {{biological}} pest control agents, or using predators, parasitoids, parasites, and pathogens to control agricultural pests, {{has the potential}} to reduce <b>agricultural</b> <b>pollution</b> associated with other pest control techniques, such as pesticide use. The merits of introducing non-native biocontrol agents have been widely debated, however. Once released, the introduction of a biocontrol agent can be irreversible. Potential ecological issues could include the dispersal from agricultural habitats into natural environments, and host-switching or adapting to utilize a native species. In addition, predicting the interaction outcomes in complex ecosystems and potential ecological impacts prior to release can be difficult. One example of a biocontrol program that resulted in ecological damage occurred in North America, where a parasitoid of butterflies was introduced to control gypsy moth and browntail moth. [...] This parasitoid is capable of utilizing many butterfly host species, and likely resulted in the decline and extirpation of several native silk moth species.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the dilemma in the {{management}} of <b>agricultural</b> non-point source <b>pollution</b> from a micro angle and put forward to some proposals. Methods employed include questionnaire surveys and peasants’ interviews. Research Results reveal that: <b>agricultural</b> non-point source <b>pollution</b> is not induced entirely by the modern agricultural technology. Rather, it results from the lack of adequate public services provided by the government, which lead to a high-yield, low efficient and high-input pattern of agriculture instead of a high-yield, high-efficient and low-input one. Peasants have been highly relying on fertilizers and chemicals, and unwilling to adopt an eco-friendly agricultural technology due to the absence of economic encouragement. To control the <b>agricultural</b> non-point source <b>pollution,</b> the government should strengthen its support to public agricultural technology, and take long-run economic measures to encourage peasants to implement eco-friendly agricultural technology actively...|$|R
