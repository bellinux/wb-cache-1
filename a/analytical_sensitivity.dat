40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{approach}} that extends isogeometric shape optimization from optimization of rectangular-like NURBS patches to the optimization of topologically complex geometries. We have successfully applied this approach in designing photonic crystals where complex geometries have been optimized to maximize the band gaps. Salient features of this approach include the following: 1) Multi-patch Coons representation of design geometry. The design geometry is represented {{as a collection of}} Coons patches where the four boundaries of each patch are represented as NURBS curves. The use of multiple patches is motivated by the need for representing topologically complex geometries. The Coons patches are used as a design representation so that designers do not need to specify interior control points and they provide a mechanism to compute <b>analytical</b> <b>sensitivities</b> for internal nodes in shape optimization. 2) Exact boundary conversion to the analysis geometry with guaranteed mesh injectivity. The analysis geometry is a collection of NURBS patches that are converted from the multi-patch Coons representation with geometric exactness in patch boundaries. The internal NURBS control points are embedded in the parametric domain of the Coons patches with a built-in mesh rectifier to ensure the injectivity of the resulting B-spline geometry, i. e. every point in the physical domain is mapped to one point in the parametric domain. 3) <b>Analytical</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> Sensitivities of objective functions and constraints with respect to design variables are derived through nodal sensitivities.

50|$|Diagnostic assays using DNA {{hybridization}} {{are limited}} by the dissociation of antiparallell duplex helices. This can be improved by using DNA stabilizing molecules such as intercalators like ortho-TINA, which will stabilize the duplex formation. Studies show that the greatest increase in stability occurred when intercalating primers were used at the 3’ and 5’ ends. Placement of a TINA molecule in the oligonucleotide is capable of improving the <b>analytical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the probe hybridization. Para-TINA molecules decreases Tm in all positions especially when {{at the center of}} the oligonucleotide, while in the ortho-TINA molecules, the improvement was seen anywhere with neutralization at the center. Combination of terminal para- or ortho- molecule with an internal TINA molecule showed the highest increase of Tm. TINA molecules should be placed terminally for maximum increase in Tm.

40|$|Abstract The paper {{presents}} a general optimization methodology for flexible multibody systems which is demonstrated to find optimal layouts of fiber composite structures components. The {{goal of the}} optimization process is to minimize the structural deformation and, simultaneously, to fulfill a set of multidisciplinary constraints, by finding the optimal values for the fiber orientation of composite structures. In this work, a general formulation for the computation of the first order <b>analytical</b> <b>sensitivities</b> based {{on the use of}} automatic differentiation tools is applied. A critical overview {{on the use of the}} sensitivities obtained by automatic differentiation against <b>analytical</b> <b>sensitivities</b> derived and implemented by hand is made with the purpose of identifying shortcomings and proposing solutions. The equations of motion and sensitivities of the flexible multibody system are solved simultaneously being the accelerations and velocities of the system and the sensitivities of the accelerations and of the velocities integrated in time using a multi-step multi-order integration algorithm. Then, the optimal design of the flexible multibody system is formulated to minimize the deformation energy of the system subjected to a set of technological and functional constraints. The methodologies proposed are first discussed for a simple demonstrative example and applied after to the optimization of a complex flexible multibody system, represented by a satellite antenna that is unfolded from its launching configuration to its functional state.

40|$|In small ruminants, faecal egg counts (FECs) and {{reduction}} in FECs (FECR) {{are the most}} common methods for the assessment of intensity of gastrointestinal (GI) nematodes infections and anthelmintic drug efficacy, respectively. The main limitation of these methods is the time and cost to conduct FECs on a representative number of individual animals. A cost-saving alternative would be to examine pooled faecal samples, however little is known regarding whether pooling can give representative results. In the present study, we compared the FECR results obtained by both an individual and a pooled examination strategy across different pool sizes and <b>analytical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the FEC techniques. A survey was conducted on 5 sheep farms in Scotland, where anthelmintic resistance is known to be widespread. Lambs were treated with fenbendazole (4 groups), levamisole (3 groups), ivermectin (3 groups) or moxidectin (1 group). For each group, individual faecal samples were collected from 20 animals, at baseline (D 0) and 14 days after (D 14) anthelmintic administration. Faecal samples were analyzed as pools of 3 - 5, 6 - 10, and 14 - 20 individual samples. Both individual and pooled samples were screened for GI strongyle and Nematodirus eggs using two FEC techniques with three different levels of <b>analytical</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> including Mini-FLOTAC (<b>analytical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of 10 eggs per gram of faeces (EPG)) and McMaster (<b>analytical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of 15 or 50 EPG). For both Mini-FLOTAC and McMaster (<b>analytical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of 15 EPG), there was a perfect agreement in classifying the efficacy of the anthelmintic as 'normal', 'doubtful' or 'reduced' regardless of pool size. When using the McMaster method (<b>analytical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of 50 EPG) anthelmintic efficacy was often falsely classified as 'normal' or assessment was not possible due to zero FECs at D 0, and this became more pronounced when the pool size increased. In conclusion, pooling ovine faecal samples holds promise as a cost-saving and efficient strategy for assessing GI nematode FECR. However, for the assessment FECR one will need to consider the baseline FEC, pool size and <b>analytical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the method...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{a general}} {{formulation}} for the computation of the first-order <b>analytical</b> <b>sensitivities</b> {{based on the}} direct method using automatic differentiation of flexible multibody systems is presented. The direct method for sensitivity calculation is obtained by differentiating the equations that define {{the response of the}} flexible multibody systems of composite materials with respect to the design variables, which are the ply orientations of the laminated. In order to appraise the benefits of the approach suggested and to highlight the risks of the procedure, the <b>analytical</b> <b>sensitivities</b> are compared with the numerical results obtained by using the finite difference method. For the beam composite material elements, the section properties and their sensitivities are found using an asymptotic procedure that involves a two-dimensional (2 -D) finite element analysis of their cross section. The equations of the sensitivities are obtained by automatic differentiation and integrated in time simultaneously with the equations of motion of the multibody systems. The equations of motion and the sensitivities of the flexible multibody system are solved and the accelerations, velocities and the sensitivities of accelerations and velocities are integrated in time using a multi-step multi-order integration algorithm. Through the application of the methodology to two simple flexible multibody systems the difficulties and benefits of the procedure, with respect to finite difference approaches or to the direct implementation of the analytic sensitivities, are discussed.
