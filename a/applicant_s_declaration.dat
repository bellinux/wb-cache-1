The central impediment to the recognition of such a right is determining {{the extent to which a}} sustained level of economic stability must be chartered before a state can be seen as either recognizing or enforcing a right to health of any kind and at any level of magnitude. Indeed, under the ICESCR, realization of economic social and cultural rights is to be effected only under a standard of progressivity. In other words, so long a states move 2 ̆ 2 progressively 2 ̆ 2 toward the realization of these rights, no actionable violations will be sustained. This, then, results in a flawed enforcement mechanism which allows any state signatory to this foundational covenant to pace enforcement of the rights under the ICESCR according to national standards of political will and differing levels of economic development and sustainability. Economic self-interest - not transnational principles and lofty aspirational goals - will determine ultimately, the extent to which health care protections are recognized as a integral part of social, cultural, political, or human rights...|$|R

He locates this right in the ninth amendment, which affords protection to unlisted liberties. The clearest statement of the American commitment to selfgovernance, he argues, is found in Thomas Jefferson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Independence, and in the philosophy of Jeffersonian individualism. Drawing on the writing of Jefferson and Lincoln, Professor Nichol asserts that our society has committed itself to 2 ̆ 2 the progressive unfolding of individual sovereignty. 2 ̆ 2 Critics of the United States Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decisions that give constitutional protection to personal privacy interests have never suffered from a lack of ammunition. The Court has failed to locate unambiguously the textual source of rights identified in cases such as Griswold v. Connecticut and Roe v. Wade.

The result has been uncertainty about future decisions, and protests that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s actions in this area are an illegitimate usurpation of power.
