40|$|In {{determining}} the optimal redistribution {{of a given}} population's income, we ask which factor is more important: the social planner's aversion to inequality, embedded in an isoelastic social welfare function indexed by a parameter alpha, or the individuals' concern at having a low relative income, indexed by a parameter beta in a utility function that is a convex combination <b>of</b> (absolute) <b>income</b> and low relative income. Assuming that the redistribution comes at a cost (because only a fraction <b>of</b> a taxed <b>income</b> can be transferred), we find that there exists a critical level of beta below which different isoelastic social planners choose different optimal <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>incomes.</b> However, if beta is above that critical level, all isoelastic social planners choose the same <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>incomes</b> because they then find that an equal distribution <b>of</b> <b>incomes</b> maximizes social welfare regardless {{of the magnitude of}} alpha...|$|R

His previous research had been published in journals such as the British Journal Of Sociology, the Journal Of Public Policy, Labour And Industry, Perspectives On Politics, Science, and Social Indicators Research. A book called [...] "Discretionary Time: A New Measure Of Freedom", was published by the Cambridge University Press in 2008 (with Robert E Goodin, Antti Parpo, and Lina Eriksson). It is based on the authors' analysis of data from the US, Australia, Germany, France, Sweden and Finland. The book was awarded the 2009 Stein Rokkan Prize For Comparative Social Science Research by the International Social Science Council. The authors propose that temporal autonomy can be used as an indicator of freedom, which is measured by how many hours people are free to do as they please. Another one of their statements is that the richer an individual is, the more he or she feels stressed. However, they argue, a richer individual's prosperity could be part of the problem.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the productivity of}} the Spanish economy {{in relation to the}} five major European economies and also the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> primary <b>income</b> between capital and labor factors. The evolution of productivity in the Spanish economy is weak compared to the European context. Furthermore, it is also necessary to point out that equity in the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> primary <b>income</b> has deteriorated significantly over the past fifteen years. We conclude that labor income in the Spanish economy have not benefited from economic growth in the ten years prior to the 2008 crisis.

40|$|Let {{there be}} two individuals: "rich," and "poor.

Under such inefficiency and a standard utility specification, a Rawlsian social planner who seeks to maximize the utility of the worst-off individual will select a different <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>incomes</b> than a utilitarian social planner who seeks to maximize the sum of the individuals' utilities. However, when individuals prefer not only to have more income but also not to have low status conceptualized as low relative income, and when this distaste is incorporated in the individuals' utility functions with a weight that is greater than a specified critical level, then a utilitarian social planner will select the very same income distribution as a Rawlsian social planner...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper offers}} a {{property}} rights and monitoring cost explanation for the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> residual <b>income</b> and decision rights between the carriers and truck drivers under internal governance. First, by applying the property rights theory, we argue that the structure <b>of</b> residual <b>income</b> rights depends {{on the importance of}} noncontractible (intangible) assets of the truck driver to generate residual surplus. The more important the truck driver's intangible knowledge assets, the more residual income rights should be transferred to him. Second, we controlled for the monitoring costs as an additional explanatory variable <b>of</b> the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> residual <b>income</b> rights. According to agency theory, the variable proportion <b>of</b> the driver's <b>income</b> should be higher where monitoring costs are higher. Third, we investigate the relationship between residual income and residual decision rights under internal governance. If the contractual relation is governed by an employment contract, residual decision and residual income rights may be substitutes because, under fiat, a certain incentive effect of the governance structure may result either from the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> high-powered incentives or the transfer of residual decision rights to the driver. These hypotheses were tested by using data from the Hungarian trucking industry. The data provide partial support for the hypotheses. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

Against the background <b>of</b> the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> market <b>incomes,</b> wages, incomes from capital and independent employment, between groups with lower incomes (three bottom deciles), average (four middle deciles) and higher (three upper deciles) the role of the redistribution <b>of</b> <b>incomes</b> by means <b>of</b> transfers and taxes in selected countries was presented. Its influence upon the essential but unequal change of the differentiation <b>of</b> disposition <b>incomes</b> formed as a result of transfer-tax redistribution was analyzed in comparison with the differentiation <b>of</b> market <b>incomes,</b> including on the shaping of poverty in the investigated countries. Subsequently the dynamics and differentiation of social transfers was discussed closer for persons in the age of ability to work: benefits frominsurances connected with unemployment, invalidity, illness, accident and professional illness and motherhood, benefits from social aid programs and benefits of a family character.

On the basis of analysis <b>of</b> the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> market <b>incomes,</b> redistribution by means of transfers and direct taxes, material benefits of the public health service in the summing up the more important tendencies were formulated reflecting the essential differences in the implementation of the social aspects of socio-economic development of selected countries. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a formal {{model in which}} differential satiation dynamics of various consumer needs explain (not only describe) the shapes of Engel curves. In the model, individuals allocate their income to various consumption categories proportional to corresponding need deprivation states, a decision making process called matching. The model allows explaining some empirical regularities that other models have difficulties accounting for. It can, for example, reconstruct that income elasticities for food tend to decrease with rising income, and that goods that are luxuries at relatively low income levels can become necessities at higher income levels. Moreover, the paper compares the Engel curves obtained from the matching model with Engel curves obtained from a utility maximization model. While both types of Engel curves are relatively similar at high income levels, at lower income levels matching and maximization lead to very different <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>income.</b> The paper shows that a given amount <b>of</b> <b>income</b> redistribution leads to less additional welfare when individuals follow matching behavior than when they maximize their utility. Accordingly, to obtain a given amount of additional welfare more income redistribution is needed than a policy maker who (mistakenly) assumes that individuals rationally maximize their utility predicts...|$|R

However, the distribution of CAP rents are affected by the institutional structure. We find an adverse impact on <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>incomes</b> and welfare that are generated by the integration in Slovakia and in the Czech Republic. The major part of it - between 65 % to 93 % - is transferred to owners of production factors, such as hired labour, landowners and variable capital suppliers, but not as desired to support farmer incomes.
