5|$|As the Great War progressed, war {{exhaustion}} in Germany grew. The first {{strikes in}} the country {{since the start of}} the war broke out in 1915, steadily increasing in frequency and magnitude. The unions' role as troubleshooter between the employers and the workers soon led to conflict between the membership and union officials, and the Free Trade Unions steadily lost members. Correspondingly, the Reichstag faction of the SPD split over continued support for the war. The 1917 February Revolution in Russia was seen by the FVdG as <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people's desire for peace. The syndicalists paid special attention to the role the general strike (which they had been advocating for years) played in the revolution. They were unable to comment on the October Revolution as the Rundschreiben had been banned by the time it broke out.|$|E
5|$|M-64 is {{maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like all other state trunkline highways. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the highway. These traffic counts are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic (AADT). This number is <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traffic that uses a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT's surveys showed that the highest AADT along M-64 was 3,333vehicles daily on the Ontonagon River Bridge; the lowest traffic was between US2 and the Gogebic–Ontonagon county line at 418vehicles per day. The only segments of the trunkline that have been included on the National Highway System (NHS) are the US2 and M-28 concurrencies. The NHS is a network of roads important to the country's defense, economy and mobility.|$|E

There is a fan on the floor, and a plant bearing white flowers on the right. The fan is an oriental element, and <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artistic trend known as Japonisme which was then prevalent in European art. At the time, Whistler was greatly influenced by his friend and colleague Albert Joseph Moore.

5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{measures}} the traffic volumes on its highways using a calculation called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This value is <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{number of vehicles}} that use a section of roadway on any average day of the year. When the department surveyed M-247 in 2009, the southernmost section near M-13 carried 6,135vehicles; the remainder carried 6,224vehicles. As a subset of these figures, 190commercial vehicles used the trunkline on average. This was an overall increase from 2008 when the sections carried 5,031and 5,573vehicles respectively, but a decrease from the 214commercial vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the {{experiment}} {{seems to me to}} render the adoption of Fresnel's hypothesis necessary, or at least the law which he found for the expression of the alteration of the velocity of light by the effect of motion of a body; for although that law being found true may be a very strong proof in favour of the hypothesis of which it is only a consequence, perhaps the conception of Fresnel may appear so extraordinary, and in some respects so difficult, to admit, that other proofs and a profound examination on the part of geometricians will still be necessary before adopting it as <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real facts of the case.|$|E

5|$|As {{a natural}} force, {{the wind was}} often personified as one or more wind gods or as <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supernatural in many cultures. Vayu is the Hindu God of Wind. The Greek wind gods include Boreas, Notus, Eurus, and Zephyrus. Aeolus, in varying interpretations the ruler or keeper of the four winds, has also been {{described}} as Astraeus, the god of dusk who fathered the four winds with Eos, goddess of dawn. The Ancient Greeks also observed the seasonal change of the winds, {{as evidenced by the}} Tower of the Winds in Athens. Venti are the Roman gods of the winds. Fūjin is the Japanese wind god {{and is one of the}} eldest Shinto gods. According to legend, he was present at the creation of the world and first let the winds out of his bag to clear the world of mist. In Norse mythology, Njörðr is the god of the wind. There are also four dvärgar (Norse dwarves), named Norðri, Suðri, Austri and Vestri, and probably the four stags of Yggdrasil, personify the four winds, and parallel the four Greek wind gods. Stribog is the name of the Slavic god of winds, sky and air. He is said to be the ancestor (grandfather) of the winds of the eight directions.|$|E
5|$|To Whistler himself, {{however, the}} {{painting}} was not old-fashioned, but rather an expression of something new and innovative. By naming it Symphony in White, No. 3, Whistler highlighted his emphasis on composition, rather than subject matter. The use of a musical title was also <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theory of corresponding arts, which was an idea developed by the French poet Charles Baudelaire. These tendencies {{became more and more}} dominant in Whistler's art over time. His two earlier paintings Symphony in White, No. 1 and Symphony in White, No. 2 had originally been titled The White Girl and The Little White Girl respectively, and later been renamed by the artist. Whistler had originally intended to call this work Two Little White Girls, but the development of his artistic philosophy made him change his mind, and from the time of its first exhibition it has been called by its musical title.|$|E

25|$|In {{the modern}} {{microscopic}} interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics, entropy {{is the amount}} of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its thermodynamic specification. Understanding the role of thermodynamic entropy in various processes requires an understanding of how and why that information changes as the system evolves from its initial to its final state. It is often said that entropy is <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disorder, or randomness of a system, or of our lack of information about it.
