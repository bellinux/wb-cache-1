40|$|ABSTRACT: Cost-efficient {{prenatal}} {{assessments are}} needed {{that have the}} potential to identify those at risk for parent/infant relational problems. With this goal in mind, an <b>additional</b> <b>attachment</b> style descrip-tion was added to the Relationship Questionnaire Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991, an established self-report attachment measure, to create the Relationship Questionnaire: Clinical Version RQ-CV. The additional description represents a profoundly-distrustful attachment style: “I think it’s a mistake to trust other people. Everyone’s looking out for themselves, so the sooner you learn not to expect anything from anybody else the better. ” The RQ-CV was applied to a sample of 44 low-income mothers who had participated in a previous study of the impact of family risk factors on infant development. After first controlling for demographic risk factors and for other insecure adult attachment styles, mother’s profound-distrust was associated with three independent assessments of the quality of maternal interac-tions with the infant assessed 20 years earlier. In particular, profound-distrust was related to more hostile, intrusive, and negative behaviors toward the infant. The results are discussed within the frame-work of attachment theory.

In addition, the authors sought to outline variables sport organizations can use to predict donor behavior. Design/methodology/approach – Data for this project were derived from an electronic survey distributed to race participants and was analyzed in SPSS® software. Regression analysis was employed. Findings – The findings support previous research employing the PCM; wherein social situational variables have the greatest influence on the relational significance of hedonic and dispositional needs in attraction and attachment to sporting events.

Performing experiments with various ILs {{to determine the}} suitability of these molecules for specific tasks is expensive and time consuming. Thus, computer aided molecular design (CAMD) methodology has been employed to design an IL as a solvent for extraction in three different case studies, where {{the design of a}} single side chain attachment, an <b>additional</b> <b>attachment</b> and double attachments to an IL have been considered. Further, a CAMD problem is formulated for the extraction of a pharmaceutical intermediate, R-phenylacetylcarbinol from an aqueous phase, with bounds on properties including distribution coefficient (m), solvent loss (SL), selectivity (beta), solvent power (SP), octanol-water partition coefficient, thermal decomposition temperature and melting point. These properties have been estimated using the UNIFAC-IL model and the group contribution method. The exhaustive direct search method has been employed to design potential ILs which are superior in performance to toluene, the solvent employed in current industrial practice. Further, the associations between the properties m, SL, beta and SP have been determined using graphical and statistical analyses. We have identified m and SL as the independent solvent performance indicators. The potential solvents obtained from each case study are, therefore, arranged either in descending order of m or in ascending order of SL and reported here. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Maxillary molars with interradicular loss of {{periodontal}} tissue have {{an increased}} risk of <b>additional</b> <b>attachment</b> loss with an impaired long-term prognosis. Since accurate clinical analysis of furcation involvement is not feasible due to limited access, morphological variations and measurement errors, additional diagnostics, e. g., with cone-beam computed tomography, may be required. Surgical treatment options have graduated from a less invasive approach, i. e., keeping as much periodontal attachment as possible, to a more invasive approach: (1) open flap debridement with/without gingivectomy or apically repositioned flap and/or tunnelling; (2) root separation; (3) amputation/trisection of a root (with/without root separation or tunnel preparation); (4) amputation/trisection of two roots; and (5) extraction of the entire tooth. Tunnelling is indicated when the degree of root separation allows for opening of the interradicular region. Alternatively, root separation is performed particularly in root-canal treated teeth with reduced coronal tooth substance requiring crown restorations. As soon as the attachment of one or two roots in maxillary molars is severely reduced, root removal is indicated and performed either as amputation or trisection including the corresponding part of the clinical crown. While the indication for regenerative measures in maxillary molars with furcation involvement is very limited, extraction and replacement with implants is restricted, particularly in sites requiring complex alveolar ridge augmentation and sinus elevation. A systematic approach for decision making in furcation-involved maxillary molars is described in this overview, including what constitutes accurate diagnosis and what indications there are for the different surgical periodontal treatment options...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Recent {{evidence}} adds {{support to}} a traditional concept according to which the eukaryotic nucleus is organized into functional domains by scaffold or matrix attachment regions (S/MARs). These regions have previously been predicted {{to have a high}} potential for stress-induced duplex destabilization (SIDD). Here we report the parallel results of binding (reassociation) and computational SIDD analyses for regions within the human interferon gene cluster on the short arm of chromosome 9 (9 p 22). To verify and further refine the biomathematical methods, we focus on a 10 kb region in the cluster with the pseudogene IFNWP 18 and the interferon R genes IFNA 10 and IFNA 7. In a series of S/MAR binding assays, we investigate the promoter and termination regions and <b>additional</b> <b>attachment</b> sequences that were detected in the SIDD profile. The promoters of the IFNA 10 and the IFNA 7 genes have a moderate 20 % binding affinity to the nuclear matrix; the termination sequences show stronger association (70 - 80 %) under our standardized conditions. No comparable destabilized elements were detected flanking the IFNWP 18 pseudogene, suggesting that selective pressure acts on the physicochemical properties detected here. In extended, noncoding regions a striking periodicity is found of rather restricted SIDD minima with scaffold binding potential. By various criteria, the underlying sequences represent a new class of S/MARs, thought to be involved in a higher level organization of the genome. Together, these data emphasize the relevanc...|$|E

The anisotropic {{response of the}} nanostructures is modulated by the uptake of adsorbate due to screening of anisotropic polarization charges. This phenomenon, termed here surface-enhanced anisotropy modulation, is a new detection principle that allows for quantification of adsorbate by generalized ellipsometry.

The data analysis approaches of these techniques must consider the anisotropic properties and significant surface roughness of nanostructure thin films. An anisotropic Bruggeman effective medium approximation is applied for optical modeling, and a frequency overtone analysis is developed to consider the mechanical effects of liquid on oscillating nanostructures. ^ In this work, data analysis approaches for generalized ellipsometry and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation are introduced and developed for anisotropic surfaces at the solid-liquid interface. Water and its deuterated analogue are exposed over a slanted columnar thin film to determine the quantity of liquid that rigidly couples with nanostructures during quartz crystal microbalance measurement.
