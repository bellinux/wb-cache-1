40|$|Background: Ursolic {{acid and}} its cis- and trans- 3 -O-p-hydroxycinnamoyl esters have been {{identified}} as constituents of <b>American</b> <b>cranberries</b> (Vaccinium macrocarpon), which inhibit tumor cell proliferation. Since the compounds may contribute to berry anticancer properties, their content in cranberries, selected cranberry products, and three other Vaccinium species (V. oxycoccus, V. vitis-idaea and V. angustifolium) was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The ability of these compounds to inhibit growth in a panel of tumor cell lines and inhibit matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity associated with tumor invasion and metastasis was determined in DU 145 prostate tumor cells. Results: The highest content of ursolic acid and esters was found in V. macrocarpon berries (0. 460 - 1. 090 g ursolic acid and 0. 040 - 0. 160 g each ester kg- 1 fresh weight). V. vitis-idaea and V. angustifolium contained ursolic acid (0. 230 - 0. 260 g kg- 1), but the esters were not detected. V. oxycoccus was lowest (0. 129 g ursolic acid and esters per kg). Ursolic acid content was highest in cranberry products prepared from whole fruit. Ursolic acid and its esters inhibited tumor cell growth at micromolar concentrations, and inhibited MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 activity at concentrations below those previously reported for cranberry polyphenolics. Conclusion: Cranberries (V. macrocarpon) were the best source of ursolic acid and its esters among the fruit and products tested. These compounds may limit prostate carcinogenesis through matrix metalloproteinase inhibition. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Complex {{carbohydrates}} {{exist in}} almost all species of plants, animals and microorganisms. Because of their physiochemical properties, they have been traditionally applied as emulsifiers and stabilizers in food, cosmetics, textiles and as pharmaceutical ingredients. Complex carbohydrates generally exist as a layer of thick, sequential, hydrous polymers consisting of monosaccharides and non-carbohydrate substituents such as acetate, pyruvate, and phosphate. While complex carbohydrates are generally believed to serve as structural support or energy sources for the producing organisms, their potential biomedical properties have been less investigated. Our understanding of the biological activities of complex carbohydrates is further complicated since most have been tested after only rough purification and their structural characteristics need to be further elucidated. In order to establish structure-activity relationships for these molecules, careful structural studies need to be undertaken. ^ In Manuscript I, a group of oligosaccharides isolated from North <b>American</b> <b>cranberries</b> (Vaccinium macrocarpon) was investigated for their inhibition on the biofilm formation by uropathogenic bacterium Escherichia coli CFT 073. Most urinary tract infections (UTIs) are associated with E. coli that could form biofilm along the urinary tract, especially on the bladder wall, to prevent eradication by the urinal and immune system. Intake of cranberry juice is traditionally believed to have preventive effects against UTIs but the molecular mechanism is still unclear. In contrast to the role that phenolic secondary metabolites might play in preventing UTIs, carbohydrate constituents in cranberry have not been previously investigated. In this study, we identified certain oligosaccharides that are capable for reducing biofilm formation by uropathogenic E. coli. ^ In Manuscript II, a chemically characterized oligosaccharide-enriched fraction purified from the North <b>American</b> <b>cranberries</b> (Vaccinium macrocarpon) was evaluated for its capability of inhibiting the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and antioxidant effects. AGEs are glycation adducts formed via non-enzymatic glycation occurred between carbohydrates and proteins. Long term in vivo accumulation of AGEs is involved in many chronic diseases. The oligosaccharide-enriched fraction inhibited AGE formation in with comparable activity to a synthetic anti-glycating agent. In the 1, 1 -Diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging assay, Cranf 1 b-CL showed antioxidant activity superior to the synthetic commercial antioxidant, butylated hydroxytoluene. ^ In Manuscript III, a Rhamnogalacturonan-I type pectic polysaccharide was isolated from ginseng root aqueous extract and shown to prevent biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistic study on the polysaccharide exhibited its inhibitory effect on the intracellular cyclic di-GMP level of P. aeruginosa, suggesting that this polysaccharide inhibits the biofilm formation by altering a core biochemical signaling process in P. aeruginosa to interrupt the biofilm formation and promote the biofilm dispersal. ^ In Manuscript IV, the polymeric substances from maple syrup were investigated. By ethanol precipitation and anion exchange chromatography, polysaccharides including inulin, rhamnogalacturonan, arabinogalactan and dextran were extracted and purified, among which inulin was isolated from maple syrup for the first time. The structures of these polysaccharides were analyzed by glycosyl composition analysis, glycosyl linakge analysis and NMR. Further investigations should {{be focused on the}} biological activities of maple syrup polysaccharides and their contributions to the overall health benefits of maple syrup. ...|$|R
5000|$|The name {{cranberry}} {{derives from}} [...] "craneberry", first named by early European settlers in America who felt the expanding flower, stem, calyx, and petals resembled the neck, head, and bill of a crane. Another name used in northeastern Canada is mossberry. The traditional English name for Vaccinium oxycoccos, fenberry, originated from plants found growing in fen (marsh) lands. In 17th-century New England cranberries were sometimes called [...] "bearberries" [...] as bears were often seen feeding on them.In North America, Native Americans {{were the first}} to use cranberries as food. Native <b>Americans</b> used <b>cranberries</b> in a variety of foods, especially for pemmican, wound medicine, and dye. Calling the red berries Sassamanash, Algonquian peoples may have introduced cranberries to starving English settlers in Massachusetts who incorporated the berries into traditional Thanksgiving feasts. American Revolutionary War veteran Henry Hall is credited as first to farm cranberries in the Cape Cod town of Dennis around 1816. In the 1820s cranberries were shipped to Europe. Cranberries became popular for wild harvesting in the Nordic countries and Russia. In Scotland the berries were originally wild-harvested but, with the loss of suitable habitat, the plants have become so scarce that this is no longer done.|$|R

50|$|In the U.S., {{large-scale}} cranberry cultivation {{has been}} developed as opposed to other countries. <b>American</b> <b>cranberry</b> growers {{have a long history}} of cooperative marketing. As early as 1904, John Gaynor, a Wisconsin grower, and A.U. Chaney, a fruit broker from Des Moines, Iowa, organized Wisconsin growers into a cooperative called the Wisconsin Cranberry Sales Company to receive a uniform price from buyers. Growers in New Jersey and Massachusetts were also organized into cooperatives, creating the National Fruit Exchange that marketed fruit under the Eatmor brand. The success of cooperative marketing almost led to its failure. With consistent and high prices, area and production doubled between 1903 and 1917 and prices fell. In 1918, US$54,000 was spent on advertising, leading to US$1 million in increased sales.|$|E
5000|$|In 1550, James White Norwood made {{reference}} to Native <b>Americans</b> using <b>cranberries.</b> In James Rosier's book The Land of Virginia there is an account of Europeans coming ashore and being met with Native Americans bearing bark cups full of cranberries. In Plymouth, Massachusetts, there is a 1633 account of the husband of Mary Ring auctioning her cranberry-dyed petticoat for 16 shillings. In 1643, Roger Williams's book A Key Into the Language of America described cranberries, referring to them as [...] "bearberries" [...] because bears ate them. In 1648, preacher John Elliott was quoted in Thomas Shepard's book Clear Sunshine of the Gospel with {{an account of the}} difficulties the Pilgrims were having in using the Indians to harvest cranberries as they preferred to hunt and fish. In 1663, the Pilgrim cookbook appears with a recipe for cranberry sauce. In 1667, New Englanders sent to King Charles ten barrels of cranberries, three barrels of codfish and some Indian corn as a means of appeasement for his anger over their local coining of the Pine Tree shilling. In 1669, Captain Richard Cobb had a banquet in his house (to celebrate both his marriage to Mary Gorham and his election to the Convention of Assistance), serving wild turkey with sauce made from wild cranberries.

Throughout New England these areas are often artificially made for cranberry monocultures by commercial farms. Common components of the herb layer in bogs includes the carnivorous plants: round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia), and pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea). Other common herbs of the poor soils of bogs include false mayflower (Maianthemum trifolium), and some orchids, particularly, bog candles (Platanthera dilatata). The most common trees that invade bogs as they fill in are black spruce (Picea mariana), northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis), larch (Larix laricina) and black ash (Fraxinus nigra).|$|E

40|$|Background: Prostate cancer, amongst other cancer types has {{a genetic}} and {{environmental}} component, which {{can contribute to}} prostate cancer development and progression. Vaccinum macrocarpon (<b>American</b> <b>cranberry)</b> is a botanical that contains several phytochemicals which have been suggested {{to play a role}} in preventing cardiovascular disease, cancer, and urinary tract infections as well as in the maintenance of oral health. Context and purpose of this study: This investigation evaluated the effects of a flavonol-enriched fraction (FL) from the <b>American</b> <b>cranberry</b> (Vaccinium macrocarpon) containing quercetin and myricetin glycosides on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) activities and their associated regulatory proteins in DU 145 human prostate cancer cells in vitro. Results: A flavonol-enriched fraction (FL) was prepared from Vaccinium macrocarpon berries and the effect of this fraction on prostate cancer cell behaviour was assessed using biochemical and molecular approaches including cytotoxicity assays and Western blot analysis to determine protein expression. Cranberry FL decreased cellular viability of DU 145 cells at a concentration of 25 ug/ml by 20 % after 6 hours of treatment. Further investigations determined that associated with this cytotoxicity, cranberry FL decreases matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) (specifically MMP- 2 and MMP- 9) activity and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) activity through effects on specific temporal MMP regulators and uPA regulators and by affecting either the phosphorylation status and/or expression of specific MAP kinase, PI- 3 kinase, NF-kB and AP- 1 pathway associated proteins.

40|$|Forestry {{operations}} in the Pinelands National Reserve (PNR) produce significant quantities of plant residues, {{commonly referred to as}} flailed slash. The residues consist of needles, bark and wood from a variety of pine species that include: pitch pine, Pinus rigida, virginia pine, Pinus virginiana, and shortleaf pine, Pinus echinata. Currently, the slash material is not being utilized and accumulates as a waste product. A more desirable solution would be to process the flailed pine slash into marketable products to provide landowners with an economic incentive that would encourage better management practices. Three experimental container substrates were produced using flailed pine slash of three different ages combined with mushroom compost and dolomitic limestone. An outdoor container production study was performed using conditions similar to a commercial crop production system. Three species of woody plants were grown in each experimental substrate. Shoot growth was measured by height and dry mass. Experimental substrates were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, particle size distribution and bulk density. Flailed pine slash proved to be a successful component of container substrates for woody landscape plant production. Substrates containing 80 % flailed pine slash and 20 % mushroom compost, by volume, that were amended with five pounds of lime per cubic yard of flailed pine slash were able to sustain commercially acceptable plant growth. Substrates containing flailed pine slash, which had been allowed to decompose for three years, produced plants that were statistically better or equal to plants grown in medium commercially available to growers. 	In a second set of experiments, six experimental propagation media were developed for use with cranberries. Three media contained flailed pine slash that had been allowed to decompose for two years and three additional media contained flailed pine slash that had been allowed to decompose for three years. Batches of these media were un-amended or amended with either sand or perlite producing a total of six different media. After mixing, the experimental propagation media were transferred to 38 round cell propagation trays. Hardwood cuttings of <b>American</b> <b>Cranberry</b> (Vaccinium macrocarpon cv. Stevens), 7. 6 cm (3 inches) in length, were dipped in a 1000 mg/l IBA solution and inserted individually into cells. Data on percentage of survival, total top growth per flat (measured by length), total number of secondary branches and total number of tertiary branches was collected. No difference in percent survivability was observed. More cranberry shoot growth was observed on un-amended flailed pine slash media and media amended with perlite, when compared to those amended with sand. The number of secondary and tertiary shoots was greatest with the un-amended mixes and the perlite-amended three-year-old flailed pine slash. In this thesis, flailed pine slash was successfully utilized as a propagation medium for hardwood <b>American</b> <b>Cranberry</b> cuttings. The pine slash can be utilized with or without perlite amendment. This research demonstrates that flailed pine slash can be converted into marketable horticultural products with minimal processing and amendment. Utilization of the pine slash material can provide landowners with an economic incentive to encourage better management practices. Flailed pine slash can provide a sustainable alternative to sphagnum peat moss...|$|E
40|$|The <b>American</b> <b>cranberry</b> (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) is a {{recently}} domesticated, economically important, fruit crop with limited molecular resources. New genetic resources could accelerate genetic gain in cranberry through characterization of its genomic structure and by enabling molecular-assisted breeding strategies. To increase {{the availability of}} cranberry genomic resources, genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) was used to discover and genotype thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within three interrelated cranberry full-sib populations. Additional simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci {{were added to the}} SNP datasets and used to construct bin maps for the parents of the populations, which were then merged to create the first high-density cranberry composite map containing 6073 markers (5437 SNPs and 636 SSRs) on 12 linkage groups (LGs) spanning 1124 cM. Interestingly, higher rates of recombination were observed in maternal than paternal gametes. The large number of markers in common (mean of 57. 3) and the high degree of observed collinearity (mean Pair-wise Spearman rank correlations > 0. 99) between the LGs of the parental maps demonstrates the utility of GBS in cranberry for identifying polymorphic SNP loci that are transferable between pedigrees and populations in future trait-association studies. Furthermore, the high-density of markers anchored within the component maps allowed identification of segregation distortion regions, placement of centromeres on each of the 12 LGs, and anchoring of genomic scaffolds. Collectively, the results represent an important contribution to the current understanding of cranberry genomic structure and to the availability of molecular tools for future genetic research and breeding efforts in cranberry...|$|E
40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} one of the most common cancers in the Western world, and it is {{believed}} that an individual's diet affects his risk of developing cancer. There has been an interest in examining phytochemicals, the secondary metabolites of plants, in order to determine their potential anti-cancer activities in vitro and in vivo. In this study we document the effects of proanthocyanidins (PACs) from the <b>American</b> <b>Cranberry</b> (Vaccinium macrocarpon) on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in DU 145 human prostate cancer cells. Cranberry PACs decreased cellular viability of DU 145 cells at a concentration of 25 mu g/ml by 30 % after 6 h of treatment. Treatment of DU 145 cells with PACs resulted in an inhibition of both MMPs 2 and 9 activity. PACs increased the expression of TIMP- 2, a known inhibitor of MMP activity, and decreased the expression of EMMPRIN, an inducer of MMP expression. PACs decreased the expression of PI- 3 kinase and AKT proteins, and increased the phosphorylation of both p 38 and ERK 1 / 2. Cranberry PACs also decreased the translocation of the NF-kappa B p 65 protein to the nucleus. Cranberry PACs increased c-jun and decreased c-fos protein levels. These results suggest that cranberry PACs decreases MMP activity through the induction and/or inhibition of specific temporal MMP regulators, and by affecting either the phosphorylation status and/or expression of MAP kinase, PI- 3 kinase, NF-kappa B and AP- 1 pathway proteins. This study further demonstrates that cranberry PACs are a strong candidate for further research as novel anti-cancer agents. J. Cell. Biochem. 111 : 742 - 754, 2010. (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} one of the most common cancers in the world, and its {{prevalence}} is expected to increase appreciably in the coming decades. As such, more research is necessary to understand the etiology, progression and possible preventative measures to delay or to stop the development of this disease. Recently, there has been interest in examining the effects of whole extracts from commonly harvested crops on the behaviour and progression of cancer. Here, we describe the effects of whole cranberry extract (WCE) on the behaviour of DU 145 human prostate cancer cells in vitro. Following treatment of DU 145 human prostate cancer cells with 10, 25 and 50 3 ̆bcg ml 2 ̆ 2129 of WCE, respectively for 6 h, WCE significantly decreased the cellular viability of DU 145 cells. WCE also decreased the proportion of cells in the G 2 -M phase of the cell cycle and increased the proportion of cells in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle following treatment of cells with 25 and 50 3 ̆bcg ml 2 ̆ 2129 treatment of WCE for 6 h. These alterations in cell cycle were associated with changes in cell cycle regulatory proteins and other cell cycle associated proteins. WCE decreased the expression of CDK 4, cyclin A, cyclin B 1, cyclin D 1 and cyclin E, and increased the expression of p 27. Changes in p 16 INK 4 a and pRBp 107 protein expression levels also were evident, however, the changes noted in p 16 INK 4 a and pRBp 107 protein expression levels were not statistically significant. These findings demonstrate that phytochemical extracts from the <b>American</b> <b>cranberry</b> (Vaccinium macrocarpon) can affect the behaviour of human prostate cancer cells in vitro and further support the potential health benefits associated with cranberries.

40|$|Jasmonates, i. e., {{jasmonic acid}} (JA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), are {{signaling}} hormones that regulate {{a large number}} of defense responses in plants which in turn affect the plants’ interactions with herbivores and their natural enemies. Here, we investigated the effect of jasmonates on the emission of volatiles in the <b>American</b> <b>cranberry,</b> Vaccinium macrocarpon, at different levels of biological organization from gene expression to organismal interactions. At the molecular level, four genes (BCS, LLS, NER 1, and TPS 21) responded dramatically to gypsy moth larval feeding, MeJA, and mechanical wounding, but to different degrees. The most dramatic changes in expression of BCS and TPS 21 (genes in the sesquiterpenoid pathway) were when treated with MeJA. Gypsy moth larval feeding and MeJA treated plants also had dramatically elevated expression of LLS and NER 1 (genes in the monoterpene and homoterpene biosynthesis pathways, respectively). At the biochemical level, MeJA induced a complex blend of monoterpene and sesquiterpene compounds that differed from gypsy moth and mechanical damage, and followed a diurnal pattern of emission. At the organismal level, numbers of Sparganothis sulfureana moths were lower while numbers of parasitic wasps were higher on sticky traps near MeJA-treated cranberry plants than those near untreated plants. Out of 11 leaf volatiles tested, (Z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate, linalool, and linalool oxide elicited strong antennal (EAG) responses from S. sulfureana, whereas sesquiterpenes elicited weak EAG responses. In addition, mortality of S. sulfureana larvae increased by about 43 % in JA-treated cranberry plants as compared with untreated plants, indicating a relationship among adult preference, antennal sensitivity to plant odors, and offspring performance. This study highlights the role of the jasmonate-dependent defensive pathway in the emissions of herbivore-induced volatiles in cranberries and its importance in multi-trophic level interactions...|$|E
40|$|Past {{research}} into flooding tolerance and oxygen shortages in plants has been motivated largely by cultivation problems of arable crops. Unfortunately, such species are unsuitable for investigating the physiological and biochemical basis of anoxia-tolerance as selection has reduced any tolerance of anaerobiosis and anaerobic soil conditions that their wild ancestors might have possessed. Restoration of anoxia-tolerance to species {{that have lost}} this property is served better by physiological and molecular studies of the mechanisms that are employed in wild species that still possess long-term anoxia-tolerance. Case studies developing these arguments are presented {{in relation to a}} selection of crop and wild species. The flooding sensitivity and metabolism of maize is compared in relation to rice in its capacity for anaerobic germination. The sensitivity of potato to flooding is related to its disturbed energy metabolism and inability to maintain functioning membranes under anoxia and postinoxia. By contrast, long-term anoxia-tolerance in the <b>American</b> <b>cranberry</b> (Vaccinium macrocarpon) and the arctic grass species Deschampsia beringensis can be related to the provision and utilization of carbohydrate reserves. Among temperate species, the sweet flag (Acorus calamus) shows a remarkable tolerance of anoxia in both shoots and roots and is also able to mobilize carbohydrate and maintain ATP levels during anoxia as well as preserving membrane lipids against anoxic and post-anoxic injury. Phragmites australis and Spartina alterniflora, although anoxia-tolerant, are both sulphide-sensitive species which can pre-dispose them to the phenomenon of die-back in stagnant, nutrient-rich water. Glyceria maxima adapts to flooding through phenological adaptations with a seasonal metabolic tolerance of anoxia confined to winter and spring which, combined with a facility for root aeration and early spring growth, allows rapid colonization of sites with only shallow flooding. The diversity of responses to flooding in wild plants suggests that, depending on the life strategy and habitat of the species, many different mechanisms may be involved in adapting plants to survive periods of inundation and no one mechanism on its own is adequate for ensuring surviva...|$|E
