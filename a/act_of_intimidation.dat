25|$|Commissioner of the Police Andy Tsang {{confirmed}} the unprecedented {{challenges to the}} police posed by the occupations, and that as at 15 December a total of 955 individuals had been arrested, 221 activists had been hurt, and that 130 police officers had received light injuries. At the same time, Tsang anticipated further arrests, pending a three-month investigation into the occupation movement.

25|$|Giant, segmented, insect-like, {{antennae}} {{rise over}} a distant mountain range. There is no direct {{connection between the}} antennae and the aliens, but the newly discovered race is named Ark Megaforms. The demonstration of the antennae {{appears to be an}} <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>intimidation.</b> It soon becomes apparent that Ark Megaforms want the humans to leave the planet as soon as possible. The Megaforms use the Kid as their negotiator with the humans. The Kid visits the base of ER-2 several times. He allows the humans to study him and question him about his foster parents in exchange for the promise to leave. The communication does not proceed smoothly as the Kid exhibits the mixture of human and alien psychological traits. His very way of thought seems inconceivable to humans. Though he can speak, most of the questions he is either unable or unwilling to answer. Moreover, there is a conflict of interest as the humans want to find out about Ark Megaforms as much as possible while the Kid just wants them to leave.|$|E
2500|$|Nadezhda Azhgihina, {{executive}} {{secretary of the}} Russian Union of Journalists, {{was shocked by the}} incident, calling it [...] "a clear example of censorship from the owner". On 14 December 60 journalists from the Kommersant newspaper signed an open letter to Usmanov, saying, [...] "We are being compelled to be cowards, which is unworthy and unproductive...We regard [...] dismissal as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>intimidation</b> aimed at preventing any critical words about Vladimir Putin...We take particular offense at the attempt to present the dismissal of a man for his professional position as a fight for the purity of the Russian language. This is the same kind of fabrication that offended people at the election." [...] Usmanov responded that emotionally, he could [...] "understand the journalists speaking up for sacked top managers" [...] but that [...] "Kommersant Vlast is a respectable, independent, socio-political publication." [...] Mikhail Prokhorov, who had announced his candidacy for the 2012 presidential election, offered to buy Kommersant on the same day, but Usmanov rejected the offer.|$|E

His name and lineage were Welsh, and in memory of King Arthur he held tournaments which he called Round Tables, and made this display so frequent, that his own son Geoffrey became ashamed of them, and called him the King of Folly.|$|E

The Russian government labelled the organisation a [...] "foreign agent", a move which members of the organization see as retaliation on the part of the authorities.

The organization has not received any funding from foreign (non-Russian sources) since May 2014. On 18 October 2014, Russian police detained the head of local Committee of Soldiers' Mothers in Budennovsk, (73-year-old) Lyudmila Bogatenkova, on suspicion of fraud; the local Committee of Soldiers' Mothers in Saint Petersburg labelled this arrest [...] "an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>intimidation</b> in connection with her activities".|$|E

50|$|These {{practices}} were {{a break with}} the prevailing culture of Jim Crow-era Georgia, and were challenged by many citizens of Sumter County, most intensely during the 1950s, and with diminishing intensity for years thereafter. A boycott of the farm occurred during the mid-1950s. The local Chamber of Commerce met with the Full Members of The Farm to request that Koinonia sell its property and disband. The 1950s also saw acts of terrorism such as dynamiting Koinonia's roadside produce stand, firing shots into the compound, and threatening phone calls and letters. The local Ku Klux Klan drove a 70+ car motorcade to the farm as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>intimidation.</b> Koinonia members discerned that their religious views called them to bear these acts nonviolently; members responded by writing editorials to the local newspaper clarifying the farm's position, maintaining an unarmed watch {{at the entrance to}} the community during the nights, and other acts of nonviolent witness.|$|E

When it came time for the National Congress, the site for the Congress was tightly guarded by ABRI in an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>intimidation.</b> Despite this, and attempts to bribe NU members to vote against him, Wahid came through and was re-elected as NU chairman for a third term. During this term, Wahid began to move closer towards a political alliance with Megawati Sukarnoputri from the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI). Capitalizing on her father's legacy, Megawati had a lot of popularity and intended to put political and moral pressure on Suharto's regime. Wahid advised Megawati to be cautious and to avoid being nominated as president during the 1998 MPR General Session. Megawati ignored this advice and paid the price in July 1996 when her PDI headquarters were taken over by supporters of Government-backed PDI chairman, Suryadi.|$|E
