I thought it was a ridiculous sort of thing... but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> to do it, the celebration of 50,000 started to be very {{one-on-one}} and very personal. I started seeing people I knew... Those were the people that had been around the ballpark all those years, and it was really a wonderful human experience." ...|$|E
500|$|For the 1984 season, Audi added two-time world {{champion}} Walter Röhrl to their star line-up and Mouton {{now had a}} part-time role, competing in five WRC events. For {{the first time in}} nine years, she did not enter the Monte Carlo Rally. However, Mouton signed up to commentate the event for Radio Monte Carlo. She started her year well by finishing second at the Swedish Rally behind teammate and home favourite Blomqvist. Mouton later stated that [...] "finishing second was fantastic. When you are out rallying on ice or snow in country like that it is like dancing. From {{one side to the other}} side. My dancing background helped my rallying. As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> on gravel I liked it because of that. It was so nice to feel and move the car like that. Sweden, in ice and snow, like ballet!" [...] This would remain her last podium position in the World Rally Championship.|$|E
2500|$|The {{band has}} {{completed}} seven national tours, played at countless venues including Minneapolis' notable First Avenue. [...] Smith described {{the experience of}} selling out the hometown venue: [...] "When I was in high school, I used to sit in my bathroom and sing with my guitar and pretend I was on the main stage of First Avenue...I was totally transported back to that moment as soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> playing and I got all giddy." ...|$|E
60|$|Let me admit, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> to write, {{that the}} whole thing is my own fault. I should never have come. I knew better. I have known better for years. I have known that it is sheer madness to go and pay visits in other people's houses.|$|R

5000|$|In an October 13, 2015 {{post in the}} band's Facebook page, {{lead singer}} Nick stated that he had started working with the site DownWrite.

2500|$|At {{the comic}} book {{convention}} Marvelcon '75, in 1975, Stan Lee used a Fantastic Four panel discussion to announce that Kirby was returning to Marvel after having left in 1970 to work for DC Comics. Lee wrote in his monthly column, [...] "Stan Lee's Soapbox", [...] "I mentioned that I had a special announcement to make. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> telling about Jack's return, to a totally incredulous audience, everyone's head started to snap around as Kirby himself came waltzin' down the aisle to join us on the rostrum! You can imagine how it felt clownin' around with the co-creator of most of Marvel's greatest strips once more." ...|$|E

At this stage, Ronstadt began working with producer and boyfriend John Boylan. She said, [...] "As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> working with John Boylan, I started co-producing myself. I was always a part of my productions. But I always needed a producer who would carry out my whims." [...] Also in 1971, Ronstadt began talking with David Geffen about moving from Capitol Records to Geffen's Asylum Records label.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000 Panahi made The Circle, {{produced}} by Jafar Panahi Film Productions and Mikado-Lumiere Although Panahi {{claimed that he}} was not a political filmmaker, his third feature was a major departure from his first two works about children and is critical of the treatment of women under Iran's Islamist regime. Panahi has stated that [...] "I started my career making children’s films, and while doing that I had no problems with censors. As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> making feature films, it all started and I had problems," [...] but that [...] "in my first films, I worked with children and young people, but I began to think of the limitations facing these girls once they grow up. In order to visualize these limitations and to have this constraint better projected visually, I went to a social class, which has more limitations to areas that are more underprivileged, so that this idea could come out ever stronger."

2500|$|In June 1900, Weber {{was almost}} 21 and {{was living with}} her parents and two sisters at 1717 Fremont Street, Allegheny, Pennsylvania, where she was a music student. By April 1903, Weber was {{performing}} as a soprano singer and pianist. She toured the United States as a concert pianist with renowned harpist Mrs Apt Thomas until her final performance in Charleston, South Carolina a year later. After an unfortunate incident when a piano key broke during a recital, Weber retired from the concert stage, having lost her nerve to play in public. Weber describes the incident that precipitated her retirement: [...] "Just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> to play a black key came off in my hand. I kept forgetting that the key was not there, and reaching for it. The incident broke my nerve. I could not finish and I never appeared on the concert stage again. It is my belief that when that key came off in my hand, a certain phase of my development came to an end." ...|$|E

5000|$|Before the 1946 revival, Eliot {{considered}} {{revising the}} play, but [...] "as soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> {{thinking about the}} play, I have inklings of altering it still further" [...] and rather than completely rewrite his 1939 text Eliot felt [...] "it would be healthier to leave it alone" [...] and he started work on a new play, [...] "One-Eyed Riley", which became The Cocktail Party. Despite his own criticism of The Family Reunion in his 1951 lecture, Eliot let the original text stand.|$|R
5000|$|The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties were signed, <b>as</b> <b>START</b> <b>I</b> and <b>START</b> II, by the US and Soviet Union, further restricting weapons.

60|$|I {{saw some}} one thrust forward a frantic young woman. The {{officers}} stopped her, then suddenly helped {{her on the}} car, just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>started.</b> I recognized Nan. She gripped the Rube {{with both hands and}} turned a white, fearful face upon the angry crowd.|$|E
60|$|Later in the {{afternoon}} a victoria drew up before my front door just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was <b>starting</b> for the village. Lady Dennisford leaned forward <b>as</b> <b>I</b> approached. She was closely veiled, but her voice shook with anxiety.|$|R

50|$|The second stage: As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> to learn, <b>I</b> have {{to explore}} the {{situation}} {{in order to understand}} it. As I am not yet an expert in the field, I make many mistakes. These mistakes enable me to progress because by observing what happens and becoming aware of it I can adapt my attempts in relation to the feedback given by the environment. This stage ends when I know what I have to do, but I only succeed when I am wholly present in what I am doing.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{concerned}} {{myself with}} a cold grip of desire to get near the rustler who had wounded Steele. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> forward, however, Miss Sampson defeated me. Sally once more clung to my hands, and directly we were surrounded by an excited circle.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I knew it would!" [...] {{she added}} quietly, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> at the sudden crash of broken glass.

60|$|I {{would not}} wait for dinner, but pausing only for a sip of cool Madeira and some other refreshment, I made my farewells to the ladies. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> {{out of the door}} to find Benjy, who had been waiting for more than an hour, Mademoiselle gave me a neatly folded note.|$|E

6000|$|... "We'll {{let it go}} at that. The {{fact that}} Gregory sent me over for you implied a certain obligation. How far events have cleared me of it I don't know--and you don't seem willing to tell me. But I believe there is now less cause than there was for me to thrust my own wishes into the background, and, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> in another week, the {{situation}} has forced my hand. <b>I</b> can't wait <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had meant to do, {{and it would be}} a vast relief to know that I had made your future safer than it is before I go.

60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> now to pedal {{out into}} the great world, I was icily sober, and the old skill, in consequence, had deserted me entirely.

60|$|On and on I went, but I {{could not}} escape my {{sinister}} pursuer. Suddenly I heard the shuffling noise at my right, and, looking, saw another pair of eyes, evidently approaching from an intersecting corridor. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> to renew my slow retreat I heard the noise repeated behind me, and then before I could turn I heard it again at my left.|$|E
