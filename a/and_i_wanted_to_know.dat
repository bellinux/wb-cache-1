60|$|That was {{the chief}} of what my dear brother said to me on that morning.

6000|$|I do {{not know}} that any {{literary}} person will agree with me; I have gone aside to write about Miss Mitford mainly for my own satisfaction.

Now for the first time I discovered that there were lies and lies, or untruths that were not lies, which one could tell innocently although they were invented and deliberately told to deceive. This angered me at first, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how I was to distinguish between real lies and lies that were not lies, and the only answer I got was that I could distinguish them by not being a fool! ...|$|E

6000|$|Takahashi beamed upon me: [...] "More {{better place}} to camp," [...] he said, grinning. Already the Jap had won my admiration and liking.

As to this camp-site being a joy {{compared}} to the ones stretched back along the road he was assuredly right. That night we did no more than eat and unroll our beds. But next day there set in the pleasant tasks of unpacking, putting up tents and flies, cutting spruce for thick, soft beds, and a hundred odd jobs dear to every camper. Takahashi would not have any one help him. He dug a wide space for fires, erected a stone windbreak, and made two ovens out of baked mud, the like of which, and the cleverness of which I had never seen. He was a whirlwind for work.|$|E

But really {{if you want me}} to explain my motives then I may just as well say nothing. I couldn't remain outside for days without news, in a state of horrible doubt. We couldn't even tell whether you and d'Alcacer were still alive till we arrived here. You might have been actually murdered on the sandbank, after Rajah Hassim and that girl had gone away; or killed while going up the river. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> at once, as soon as possible.

You {{remember}} how the boys joked me about it--well, perhaps I didn't care that you should laugh at me too, but I've had a sore conscience over my lie, for I remembered that you seemed to have some interest in the matter too, and I thought that maybe I might have thrown you off the scent. It seemed to me that if you had any idea who it was, we might now talk the matter over and compare notes. I think you said--at least, I gathered the idea from a remark of yours," [...] he added hastily, as he remembered that the suggestion was his own, and a satirical one--"that it reminded you of your wife's slipper.

So I'd hang out with him at work, in the offices, far later than I had any reason to. I would buy clothes I couldn't afford to impress him. And eventually, I mustered the nerve to ask him on a date. And he was 15 years older than I was. And he had been my boss. And so, against his better judgement, he said yes. And it actually ended up being a really wonderful relationship.|$|E

5000|$|In a 2016 {{interview}} Stanton stated how the film's story came to be; [...] "I don't {{watch my}} films that often after they're done because I {{have to watch}} them {{so many times before}} they come out. So about 2010 when we were getting Finding Nemo ready for the 10-year re-release in 3D, it was interesting to watch again after all that time. Something kind of got lodged {{in the back of my}} brain and started to sort of stew. I started to think about how easily Dory could get lost and not find Marlin and Nemo again. She basically was in the same state that she was when Marlin found her. I didn't know where she was from. I knew that she had spent most of her youth wandering the ocean alone, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that she could find her new family, if she ever got lost again. It's almost like the parental side of me was worried." [...] Stanton additionally stated: [...] "I knew if I ever said Finding Dory or mentioned a sequel to Finding Nemo out loud, I’d be done, There would be no way I'd be able to put that horse back in the barn. So I kept it very quiet until I knew I had a story that I thought would hold, and that was in early 2012. So I pitched it to John Lasseter and he was all into it. Then I got a writer, and once we had a treatment that we kind of liked, I felt comfortable calling Ellen." ...|$|E
40|$|My thesis’ aim is {{to present}} and give a brief {{overview}} of the history of corpus linguistics. I did not hear anything about corpus till last semester when I enrolled to the Corpus Linguistics course. When I saw the name of the course I could not imagine what it was and what it was about. Then gradually I got familiar with corpus as I was reading Mr Hollosy’s course material and {{by the time of the}} end term exam I could talk about corpus linguistics. It surprises me that I was not taught about it at college, and I was not prepared to use it in my teaching work. It could make my teaching process easier. I decided to collect all the information about the history of corpus because I was interested in it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> why it was not the part of my learning material at college. I wanted to know more about when the first corpora appeared and how long researchers and teachers have used them in their work. régi képzésangol nyelv és irodalom szakos tanár (távoktatás...|$|E
40|$|Since Hinduism is so complex, it is {{impossible}} to discuss every aspect of this religion in one paper. Instead of giving an overview of Hinduism, I have decided to focus on several parts of Hinduism: religious holidays; Gods, Goddesses, and their meaning; prayer, forgiveness, and life after death; spiritual exercise; and Hinduism in practice. I addressed these subjects through research and through interviews {{in order to get a}} diverse perspective on Hinduism. I could not write about Hinduism without including a section on its holidays, since religious holidays are such an important part of Indian culture. I chose the topic Gods, Goddesses, and their meaning, because I wanted to know the role that God or Gods play in Hinduism. This naturally led to the topic of prayer and Hindus' relationship with their God or Gods. Some Hindus believe in an after-life, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how a Hindu might attain a blissful life after death. I also addressed the topic of forgiveness for sinful behavior, because, in my own religion, Christianity, one must acquire forgiveness before he or she achieves a blissful life after death. Finally, I discussed spiritual exercise and Hinduism in practice to see how Hindus practice their religion day to day. From research, I achieved a better understanding of Hinduism. Through interviewing three Hindus, I discovered that not everyone agrees with every aspect of their religion. Also, I found that Christianity and Hinduism are not so drastically different as I originally thought. Honors CollegeThesis (B. S. ...|$|E
