In this paper we consider one such problem: A group of people in a meeting room {{do not have access to}} public key infrastructure or third party key management service, and they do not share any other prior electronic context. How can they set up a secure session among their computers? We examine various alternatives and propose new protocols for password-based multi-party key agreement in this scenario. Our protocols may be applicable in other scenarios, too. We also present a fault-tolerant version of a multiparty Die-Hellman key agreement protocol which can be of independent interest.

30|$|However, {{although}} many of the topics dealt with by ecotoxicologists and environmental chemists are recognized as being of global significance, well-founded, unbiased information rarely finds its way to the public. Therefore, an <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>meeting</b> on how to communicate important issues and research results to society was held during the 21 st SETAC GLB annual meeting in Tübingen, Germany, in 2016. The participants decided to organize a workshop involving scientists representing SETAC’s tripartite structure (i.e., academia, business, and government) as well as media specialists. The workshop was held in Hirschberg, Germany, in November 2017. Views and perspectives on science and risk communication were discussed to initiate a broader discussion in SETAC GLB and the GDCh on the communication of research findings from our discipline. As an outcome of the meeting it was agreed that (1) the discussions on public communication and transfer of our knowledge to society should be increased; (2) ecotoxicologists and environmental chemists from German-speaking countries should apply jointly for coordinated large-scale research funding programs; and (3) a joint platform for sharing knowledge on environmental contaminants via movie clips, press material, and virtual reality concepts should be developed.|$|E
40|$|In most {{meeting room}} {{scheduling}} or management system, {{the availability of}} meeting rooms are mainly based on pre-determined schedules. However, since the meeting duration is not always exact as it is scheduled, there are some situations that a meeting room is underutilized. Therefore, in this paper, we present a smart meeting room scheduling and management system which detect occupancy status of meeting rooms in realtime and integrate this information into the scheduling application to support <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>meetings</b> and increase room utilization. Our system is a simple, ease-of-implementation solution based on PIR sensor fusion devices and Ethernet connectivity. Occupancy data is sent to a central application server by UDP over IP protocols. On this server, a web application is developed and hosted to not only allow people book rooms for their meetings, but also check the utilization of these rooms based on predefined policies.

40|$|An {{important}} {{challenge in}} designing ubiquitous computing experiences is negotiating the transition between explicit and implicit interaction, {{such as how}} and when to provide users with notifications. While the paradigm of implicit interaction has important benefits, it is also susceptible to difficulties with hidden modes, unexpected action, and misunderstood intent. To address these issues, this work presents a framework for implicit interaction and applies it to the design of an interactive whiteboard application called Range. Range is a public interactive whiteboard designed to support collocated, <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>meetings.</b> It employs proximity sensing capability to proactively transition between display and authoring modes, clear space for writing, and cluster ink strokes. We show how the implicit interaction techniques of user presentation (how users implicitly indicate what they are doing), system presentation (how systems indicate what they are doing), and override (how users can interrupt or stop a proactive system action) can prevent, mitigate, and correct errors in the whiteboard's proactive behaviors. These techniques can be generalized to improve the designs of a wide array of ubiquitous computing experiences...|$|R

This book chapter investigates a novel usage type of this technology, ad-hoc shared-ride trip planning in transportation networks. Shared-ride trips involve transportation clients such as pedestrians arranging on a short-term basis with transportation hosts such as private automobiles or taxi cabs for flexible travel provision. However, assigning clients and hosts in an ad-hoc, timely manner challenges current trip planning approaches, in particular for non-scheduled hosts. Current approaches based on centralized services do not scale well nor provide optimal trip assignment in such a highly flexible and dynamic environment. Thus, we propose a novel approach considering the transportation network as an ad-hoc mobile geosensor network using a short-range, self-organizing strategy. This approach can be fully scalable if every new transportation request can be solved locally in the geosensor network, a property that we investigate by comparing different communication strategies between nodes in the system. We will demonstrate that local communication strategies save communication costs and still deliver near-to-optimal trips. 1...|$|R

It facilitates the effective teaching, a face-toface meeting environment, {{clearing the way for}} efficient communication. It is an effective form of communication with distinct benefits. Today, more than ever, it is proving to be an extremely powerful tool, helps to gain knowledge with ease by helping us to increase effectiveness, maximize the resources and optimize the productivity. Some of the distinct benefits of videoconferencing are: it lets you be at two different places at the same time, and you can have more frequent contacts with students, parents, other institutes, universities without leaving the place of work. It allows for <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>meetings,</b> letting you discuss the urgent matters and take immediate decisions. The Audio and video interaction enables you to act as you would in a physical meeting by letting you save the time, the resources and money. With respect to instructions, student’s achievements and attitude towards learning, research has not proven the efficacy of computers and software alone. However, when used appropriately as a supplement to conventional instructions, several researchers have found the results to be overwhelmingly positive, in education. Computer software provides many instructional benefits, but Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) can have a much greater impact on student’s learning. In a classroom utilizing CAI, students often work independently or in pairs at computers around the room. Training had become most essential and integral part of our life. Hence, in order to sustain with today’s enormous pressure of healthy competition, it is the need of an hour to review the various teaching /training aids and accordingly choose the best one like video conferencing combine with CAI.

40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about how health care {{professionals}} deal with ethical challenges in mental health care, especially when not making use of a formal ethics support service. Understanding this is important {{in order to be}} able to support the professionals, to improve the quality of care, and to know in which way future ethics support services might be helpful. Methods: Within a project on ethics, coercion and psychiatry, we executed a focus group interview study at seven departments with 65 health care professionals and managers. We performed a systematic and open qualitative analysis focusing on the question: 'How do health care professionals deal with ethical challenges?' We deliberately did not present a fixed definition or theory of ethical challenge. Results: We categorized relevant topics into three subthemes: 1) Identification and presence of ethical challenges; 2) What do the participants actually do when dealing with an ethical challenge?; and 3) The significance of facing ethical challenges. Results varied from dealing with ethical challenges every day and appreciating it as a positive part of working in mental health care, to experiencing ethical challenges as paralyzing burdens that cause a lot of stress and hinder constructive team cooperation. Some participants reported that they do not have the time and that they lack a specific methodology. Quite often, informal and retrospective <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>meetings</b> in small teams were organized. Participants struggled with what makes a challenge an ethical challenge and whether it differs from a professional challenge. When dealing with ethical challenges, a number of participants experienced difficulties handling disagreement in a constructive way. Furthermore, some participants plead for more attention for underlying intentions and justifications of treatment decisions. Conclusions: The interviewed health care professionals dealt with ethical challenges in many different ways, often in an informal, implicit and reactive manner. This study revealed nine different categories of what health care professionals implicitly or explicitly conceive as 'ethical challenges'. Future research should focus on how ethics support services, such as ethics reflection groups or moral case deliberation, can be of help with respect to dealing with ethical challenges and value disagreements in a constructive way...|$|R
40|$|When Great Foster Tries His Hand at Small Things [...] . Well, {{maybe not}} so small after all. When you drive into Miilheim-and-der-Ruhr, you {{are bound to}} be {{astonished}} by a hybrid building which seems to combine two eras. It is the headquarters of the agiplan Gruppe, and whoever visits {{it will be able to}} find out that wings can be added even to a block of concrete. What follows is a press release of the practice which created it. Foster and Partners’ new addition to the building, completed in May 1996, is one of several recent projects completed by the practice in the Ruhr since 1989 which seek to revitalise de¬pressed industrial areas and integrate new building into the older building fabric. The challenge for the agiplan project was how to extend its existing relatively modem 1970 s of¬fice building, designed by agiplan’s founder, to create new office areas with a central space between the two wings which could become the heart and focus of the company for both staff and the public. This 5200 sqm addition has a sweeping curved facade which gives agiplan a dynamic new public face and new en¬trance. The building’s four storeys are centred around a dra¬matic 18 -metre-high atrium which links the old and new wings. There are walkways across the atrium on each of the upper floors and a striking staircase connecting all floors. Its glazed roof allows daylight to penetrate the adjacent offices. The facade of the old wing, now on the atrium side, has been entirely removed and replaced by a glass balustrade mirror¬ing that of the new addition. The building brings together under one roof all the agip¬lan departments previously scattered around the region. It provides flexible and cellular offices, a gallery and library plus an atrium accommodating temporary exhibitions, staff cafeteria, and reception area. A new open-plan office space has been created on the ground floor of the old building to be used for <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>meetings</b> and studio work. The atrium has an oak parquet floor while the office areas have a vibrant blue carpet. The planning grid and floor heights of the new building match those of the old. Refurbishment has included exposing the underside of the impressive long-span curved concrete beams of the existing building. In the new addition, a half open, suspended ceiling provides acoustic insulation whilst still revealing parts of the concrete slab above. The building is naturally ventilated along its perimeter. Return air is extracted via the atrium space, which helps to reduce energy consumption. Solar glare and gain are mini¬mised with the use of sun protection glazing and double glazed panels with integral louvres in the cavity. On the north facade, transparent thermal insulation maximises daylight into the cellular offices behind. Foster and Partners were appointed architects in 1992. Construction began in January 1995 and was finished in July 1996...|$|R
40|$|The {{shortage}} of critical medical supplies in healthcare facilities is of obvious concern to both medical professionals and patients. Speci cally, the growing concern {{in this area}} is motivated, at least in part, by our dependence on generic pharmaceuticals. In the absence of FDA restrictions on the production of critical generic goods (e. g. morphine), manufacturers possess little financial incentive to produce numerous products whose patents have expired, but remain critical to patient care. Therefore, faced with crippling shortages, hospitals are left seeking <b>ad-hoc</b> solutions for <b>meeting</b> patient demand of these items. This work considers quantitative response strategies to mitigate the impact of these shortages. Speci cally, lateral transshipments of supplies amongst cooperative hospitals are analyzed to assess their impact and utility with respect to the amount of met demand and the quality of service. In addition, a multi-objective optimization model is considered that off ers insight about how intelligently structured collaboration between hospitals can improve service levels and reduce unmet demand across the system while considering transportation costs. The combination of these analyses provides medical decision-makers with a fundamental level of intuition necessary to guide hospitals in their reaction to supply shortages...|$|R
