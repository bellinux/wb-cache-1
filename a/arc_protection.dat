40|$|ABSTRACT: Photovoltaic (PV) {{systems have}} caused {{residential}} and commercial building fires when an electrical arc fault initiates in the conduction path. Article 690. 11 in the United States 2011 National Electrical Code requires new photovoltaic systems on or penetrating a building to include a listed <b>arc</b> fault <b>protection</b> device to prevent additional fires. In response, manufacturers are creating arc fault circuit interrupters (AFCIs) using electrical frequencies for detection, but their operation is not fully characterized. Sandia National Labs has undergone a major effort to identify detection difficulties and establish tests for PV AFCI manufacturers to ensure their product can robustly detect arcing conditions while avoiding false trips from noise sources. In previous studies, arc fault signatures have been compared to string noise and frequency-dependant attenuation through PV modules has been quantified. In this paper, a frequency response analyzer {{was used to measure}} radio frequency (RF) propagation through arrays of varying irradiance and size. Irradiance did not affect module frequency response, but the length of unshielded wiring significantly affected the frequency response of the system above 100 kHz due to RF effects.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{information}} generated in substation automation systems has grown exponentially since the introduction of Intelligent Electrical Devices (IED). Until recent years substation communication between IEDs was realized with proprietary protocols. This led to communication problems in systems with IEDs from different vendors. The IEC 61850 standard was introduced in order to harmonize substation communication and gain interoperability. The IEC 61850 is an international standard defining communication networks and systems in substations. The standard defines substation functions, communication services and communication between devices as independent units. Thus the standard {{provides an opportunity for}} redefinition if technology in one area develops. The standard divides substation communication into three levels. This study focuses on horizontal GOOSE communication between IEDs in bay level and its applications. Horizontal communication has conventionally been solved by hardwiring required information between devices. GOOSE communication enables the transmission of these signals via Ethernet network, therefore creating a system that is more easily expandable and reducing the need of hardwiring. The purpose of this work is to provide information for ABB Process Industry Plc concerning IEC 61850 and GOOSE. The substance of IEC 61850 and horizontal communication are presented in the theory chapters. The applications of GOOSE were examined in order to get more practical results. The applications were selected based on the capabilities of recently introduced REF 615 IED. Each application is first described in general, followed by an example solution with REF 615 IEDs.

40|$|Équipe 107 : Physique des plasmas chaudsInternational audienceA Arcs are the {{potentially}} most dangerous events related to Lower Hybrid (LH) antenna operation. If left uncontrolled they can produce damage and cause plasma disruption by impurity influx. To {{address this issue}} an arc real time control and protection imaging system for the Joint European Torus (JET) LH antenna has been implemented. The LH system {{is one of the}} additional heating systems at JET. It comprises 24 microwave generators (klystrons, operating at 3. 7 GHz) providing up to 5 MW of heating and current drive to the JET plasma. This is done through an antenna composed of an array of waveguides facing the plasma. The protection system presented here is based primarily on an imaging arc detection and real time control system. It has adapted the ITER like wall hotspot protection system using an identical CCD camera and real time image processing unit. A filter has been installed to avoid saturation and spurious system triggers caused by ionization light. The antenna is divided in 24 Regions Of Interest (ROIs) each one corresponding to one klystron. If an arc precursor is detected in a ROI, power is reduced locally with subsequent potential damage and plasma disruption avoided. The power is subsequently reinstated if, during a defined interval of time, arcing is confirmed not to be present by image analysis. This system was successfully commissioned during the restart phase and beginning of the 2013 scientific campaign. Since its installation and commissioning, arcs and related phenomena have been prevented. In this contribution we briefly describe the camera, image processing, and real time control systems. Most importantly, we demonstrate that an LH antenna <b>arc</b> <b>protection</b> system based on CCD camera imaging systems works. Examples of both controlled and uncontrolled LH arc events and their consequences are shown...|$|E

Currently there is little experimental or empirical research into {{the behavior of the}} arcing frequencies through PV components despite the potential for modules and other PV components to filter or attenuate arcing signatures that could render the arc detector ineffective. To model AC arcing signal propagation along PV strings, the well-studied DC diode models were found to inadequately capture the behavior of high frequency arcing signals. Instead dynamic equivalent circuit models of PV modules were required to describe the impedance for alternating currents in modules. The nonlinearities present in PV cells resulting from irradiance, temperature, frequency, and bias voltage variations make modeling these systems challenging. Linearized dynamic equivalent circuits were created for multiple PV module manufacturers and module technologies. The equivalent resistances and capacitances for the modules were determined using impedance spectroscopy with no bias voltage and no irradiance. The equivalent circuit model was employed to evaluate modules having irradiance conditions that could not be measured directly with the instrumentation. Although there was a wide range of circuit component values, the complex impedance model does not predict filtering of arc fault frequencies in PV strings for any irradiance level. Experimental results with no irradiance agree with the model and show nearly no attenuation for 1 Hz to 100 kHz input frequencies...|$|R
