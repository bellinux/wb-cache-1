5|$|Varner's second monograph, Personhood, Ethics, <b>and</b> <b>Animal</b> Cognition: Situating Animals in the Two-Level Utilitarianism of R. M. Hare, was {{published}} in 2012 by Oxford University Press. Varner {{had been working on}} questions about R. M. Hare and animals since 2001, when he taught a graduate class exploring the subject; given that Peter Singer was a student of Hare, Varner was interested in exploring whether Hare's philosophy endorsed Singer's conclusions about animal liberation. A project entitled Harey Animals: Situating Animals in the Two-Level Utilitarianism of R. M. Hare was submitted to Oxford University Press, but this was subsequently split into two books; Personhood, Ethics, <b>and</b> <b>Animal</b> Cognition was the first, while the second, the forthcoming Sustaining Animals: Envisioning Humane, Sustainable Communities, in under contract with the publisher. While Personhood, Ethics, <b>and</b> <b>Animal</b> Cognition addresses theoretical issues in Hare's philosophy, Sustaining Animals is more practically focussed, exploring the applicability of the Harean philosophy developed in Personhood, Ethics, <b>and</b> <b>Animal</b> Cognition to real-world issues concerning human-animal relationships. Varner is also co-authoring a textbook under contract with Cambridge University Press entitled Environmental Ethics for Environmentalists with the University of Guelph ecologist Jonathan Newman and the Guelph philosopher Stefan Linquist.|$|E
