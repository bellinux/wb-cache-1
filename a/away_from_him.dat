Anticipating further attacks, Monsoor, three SEAL snipers and three Iraqi Army soldiers {{took up a}} rooftop position. Civilians aiding the insurgents blocked off the streets, and a nearby mosque broadcast a message for people {{to fight against the}} Americans and the Iraqi soldiers. Monsoor was protecting other SEALs, two of whom were 15 feet <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him.</b> Monsoor's position made him the only SEAL on the rooftop with quick access to an escape route.|$|E

5|$|The winter had {{political}} ramifications {{and caused}} {{the public to}} lose faith in a Labour government who could not maintain food and electricity supplies. Long-time Labour activist Manny Shinwell {{was in charge of}} the coal supply. He repeatedly denied there were problems. He blamed the climate, the railway system, or capitalism generally. The cabinet had to take control <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> and he became the scapegoat.|$|E

5|$|A. Alberto Contador was {{the winner}} at the podium {{ceremony}} in Milan {{on the last day}} of the 2011 Giro d'Italia, but was subsequently found to have tested positive for performing-enhancing drugs on a rest day in the 2010 Tour de France. He was originally suspended on 25 January 2011 for a year, but appealed the decision. The Court of Arbitration for Sport found him guilty of using clenbuterol during the race; thus his results since the 2010 Tour de France were taken <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> and he was stripped of the win on 6 February 2012.|$|E

However, he begins to experience seemingly-psychic visions which lead him to believe she {{is being held in}} their former home. The police raid the address but find it empty; Black finds a polaroid of another house inside. He is able to track down the address of this house, but goes alone this time. Reaching it, he finds Catherine in the basement, bound to a rafter. He goes to untie her but is blinded by a camera flash. He struggles with the Polaroid Man, which we see through a series of photographs taken by the man's camera. Black is able to wrest the Polaroid Man's knife <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> and stab him to death.|$|E
5|$|In 1842 England, a {{young boy}} builds a snowman, but refuses {{to play with the}} other children. The snowman starts {{speaking}} to the boy, repeating his assertions that the other children are silly. Fifty years later, the boy has grown up to be Dr. Walter Simeon, proprietor of the Great Intelligence Institute. He hires men to collect samples of snow, which he places in a large snow-filled globe in his laboratory before feeding the men to a group of animated snowmen. The Doctor, still despondent after losing his former companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams, has parked his TARDIS above Victorian London among the clouds. He uses his allies Vastra, Jenny, and Strax to keep people <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him.</b> They also fill their time investigating mysteries throughout the city.|$|E
5|$|In {{the main}} event, Triple H faced Kevin Nash inside Hell in a Cell for the World Heavyweight Championship, with Mick Foley as the guest referee. During {{the start of}} the match, both men used a steel chair, a hammer, and the cell to their advantage. Eventually, Nash hit Triple H with a barbed wire bat many times before Triple H hit him with the steel steps. As Triple H brought a {{sledgehammer}} into the ring, Foley attempted to take it <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> resulting in Triple H hitting Foley and Nash with a steel chair. Triple H followed up, Pedigreeing Nash. During this time, Foley had recuperated and was able to officiate the pinfall made by Triple H on Nash, thus Triple H retained the World Heavyweight Title.|$|E

5|$|In {{the seventh}} stage to Bordeaux, Trousselier {{punctured}} {{after only a}} few kilometers. The rest of the cyclists quickly sped <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> and Trousselier had to follow them alone for 200km. A few kilometers before Bordeaux, Trousselier caught up with the rest, and even managed to win the sprint. Louis Trousselier kept his lead {{until the end of the}} race, winning five stages. Trousselier was accused of bad sportsmanship: he reportedly smashed the inkstands of a control post to prevent his opponents from signing. Unlike the 1904 Tour de France, no stage winners, nor anyone from the top ten of the general classification, were disqualified.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} of June, Cancellara began the Tour de Luxembourg. He won the prologue {{and was the first}} to wear the race leader's yellow jersey. He then held the lead until the second stage came to a close when stage winner Linus Gerdemann took the lead <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him.</b> Cancellara then raced the Tour de Suisse and won the opening and closing stages of the race, which were both {{individual}} time trials.

They reach Coney Island through their ensuing brawl and Octopus, aware of Spider-Man's desire to save innocent lives, kidnaps Liz. With only an hour of energy left, he climbs {{to the top of a}} roller coaster, forcing Spider-Man to choose between the power pack and Liz. Spider-Man throws the pack in the air before rescuing Liz; he gets close to Dr. Octopus as the latter scrambles for the power pack and is able to take it <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> successfully defeating the doctor.|$|E

5|$|The Ages of Myst were {{occasionally}} seen as lonely by {{players and}} reviewers. As a result, Cyan added more characters to the sequel, Riven. Villagers scurry {{away as the}} player approaches, and major characters such as Gehn and a rebel band known as the Moiety address the player and give or take items <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> or her. For the first time, Cyan directed the live action actors for Rivens scenes; the designers, including Richard Vander Wende, were apprehensive about how the characters would fit in the finished product. Rand Miller reprised his role of Atrus due to fan expectation, even though he hated acting.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match on}} the undercard was a {{standard}} match that featured Triple H and The Rock. Continuing the storyline of The Rock's injured arm, Triple H was scripted to target and attack The Rock's arm. Towards {{the final moments}} of the bout, Triple H asked Chyna, his valet, to retrieve a folding chair. The referee, however, took it <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> which led to an argument between Triple H and the referee; the mishap prompted Triple H to push the referee down. The referee disqualified Triple H for this action; thus, The Rock won the match. After the match, Mankind ran in to save The Rock from Triple H and Chyna.|$|E
5|$|Though {{most of the}} Jews {{still alive}} in Linz after the war had emigrated, Wiesenthal decided to stay on, partly because the family of Adolf Eichmann lived a few blocks <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him.</b> Eichmann had {{been in charge of}} the {{transportation}} and deportation of Jews in the Nazi Final Solution to the Jewish Question: a plan, finalised at the Wannsee Conference—at which Eichmann took the minutes—to exterminate all the Jews in Europe. After the war, Eichmann hid in Austria using forged identity papers until 1950, when he left via Italy and moved to Argentina under an assumed name. Hoping to obtain information on Eichmann's whereabouts, Wiesenthal continuously monitored the remaining members of the immediate family in Linz until they vanished in 1952.|$|E

60|$|Pierston was {{conscious}} of a singular change in himself, which had been revealed by this slight discourse. He {{was no longer the}} same man that he had hitherto been.
