The system manipulates and accurately merges information coming from subsequent video frames, making small computational efforts in each single frame. Its main characterizing feature is to combine several well-known movement detection and tracking techniques, and to orchestrate them in a smart way to obtain good results in diversified scenarios. It uses dynamically adjusted thresholds to characterize different regions of interest, and it also adopts techniques to efficiently track movements, and detect and correct false positives. Accuracy and reliability mainly depend on the overall receipt, i. e., on how the software system is designed and implemented, on how the different algorithmic phases communicate information and collaborate with each other, and on how concurrency <b>is</b> organized.

High-speed serial I/O has a native lower limit for operating data rates, preventing easy interfacing to low-speed client signals. The non-integer data recovery unit (NI-DRU) presented in this <b>application</b> note <b>is</b> <b>specifically</b> <b>designed</b> for RocketIO ™ GTP and GTX transceivers in Virtex®- 5 LXT, SXT, TXT, and FXT platforms and consists of look-up tables (LUTs) and flip-flops. The NI-DRU extends the lower data rate limit to 0 Mb/s and the upper limit to 1, 250 Mb/s, making embedded high-speed transceivers the ideal solution for true multi-rate serial interfaces. The NI-DRU’s operational settings (data rate, jitter bandwidth, input ppm range, and jitter peaking) are dynamically programmable, thus avoiding the need for bitstream reload or partial reconfiguration. Operating on a synchronous external reference clock, the NI-DRU supports fractional oversampling ratios. Thus, only one BUFG is needed, independent of the number of channels being set up, even if all channels are operating at different data rates. Given the absence of a relationship between the reference clock and incoming data rate, two optional barrel shifters ease the interfacing of the NI-DRU with an external FIFO and/or with any required decoder.
