5|$|The Heart of a Woman is {{the first}} time Angelou {{identifies}} with another female African-American writer. Her early literary influences were men, including James Weldon Johnson, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, and William Shakespeare. Angelou has stated that she always admired women writers like Anne Spencer, Jessie Fauset, Nella Larsen, and Zora Neale Hurston. Her choice of title for this book is <b>an</b> <b>acknowledgment</b> of her legacy as a Black woman writer.|$|E
5|$|In 1250 or 1251, Mindaugas {{agreed to}} receive baptism and {{relinquish}} control over some lands in western Lithuania, {{in return for}} <b>an</b> <b>acknowledgment</b> by Pope Innocent IV as king. The Pope welcomed a Christian Lithuania as a bulwark against Mongol threats; in turn, Mindaugas sought papal intervention in the ongoing Lithuanian conflicts with the Christian orders. On 17 July 1251, the pope signed two crucial papal bulls. One ordered the Bishop of Chełmno to crown Mindaugas as King of Lithuania, appoint a bishop for Lithuania, and build a cathedral. The other bull specified that the new bishop was to be directly subordinate to the Holy See, {{rather than to the}} Archbishop of Riga. This autonomy was a welcome development. The precise date of Mindaugas's baptism is not known. His wife, two sons, and members of his court were baptized; Pope Innocent wrote later that a multitude of Mindaugas's subjects also received Christianity.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{exhibited a}} contrast of bare nave walls against the paintings {{drawn on the}} metal ceilings leading to the main altar and retablo mayor. The ceiling paintings {{were known to be}} works of Raymundo Francia, as shown by his signature on one corner of the dome in the 1930s. <b>An</b> <b>acknowledgment</b> on the initiative of the San Tarcisio Martir Maribojoc Catholic Association 'Comité de Obras' could also be seen painted before the crossing. Several paintings by Francia on metal had deteriorated even before the total destruction of the church by earthquake in 2013. The Francia paintings were never touched up nor repainted. The new church dome (or cimborrio) was constructed in June 1889. Ray Francia was again commissioned to do mural works on the cimborrio by painting the Epistles of The Four Apostles, namely the saints John, Matthew, Luke and Mark.|$|E

5|$|The tour {{received}} general critical acclaim, with critics praising Gaga's singing abilities, the theatricality of the show, and {{her sense}} of style and fashion. The Monster Ball was a commercial success, with sold-out shows and demand for tickets prompting organizers to add more dates to the itinerary. It ultimately grossed an estimated US$227.4million from 200reported shows and an audience of 2.5million. At the 2010 Billboard Touring Awards, Gaga won the Breakthrough Performer Award, {{as well as the}} Concert Marketing & Promotion Award, the latter being <b>an</b> <b>acknowledgment</b> of her partnership with sponsor Virgin Mobile. HBO filmed a special of The Monster Ball Tour during Gaga's February 2011 shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

40|$|Abstract — We define {{energy-efficient}} {{broadcast and}} multicast schemes for reliable communication in multi-hop wireless networks. Unlike previous techniques, {{the choice of}} neighbors in the broadcast and multicast trees in these schemes, are based {{not only on the}} link distance, but also on the error rates associated with the link. Our schemes can be implemented using both positive and negative acknowledgment based reliable broadcast techniques in the link layer. Through simulations we show that our scheme achieves upto 45 % improvement over previous schemes on realistic 100 -node network topologies. <b>A</b> positive <b>acknowledgment</b> based implementation is more energy-efficient, in realistic reliable broadcast and multicast environments, <b>a</b> negative <b>acknowledgment</b> based implementation is preferred. Our simulations show that the additional benefits of <b>a</b> positive <b>acknowledgment</b> based implementation is marginal (1 - 2 %). Therefore <b>a</b> negative <b>acknowledgment</b> based implementation of our schemes is equally applicable in constructing energy-efficient reliable broadcast and multicast data delivery paths.

25|$|In two-way trunks with E and M signaling, a {{handshake}} took place to prevent both switches from colliding by dialing {{calls on the}} same trunk at the same time. By changing the state of these leads from ground to -48 volts, the switches stepped through {{a handshake}} protocol. Using DC voltage changes, the local switch would send a signal {{to get ready for}} a call and the remote switch would reply with <b>an</b> <b>acknowledgment</b> to go ahead with dial pulsing. This was done with relay logic and discrete electronics.|$|E
25|$|At-will {{employment}} disclaimers are {{a staple}} of employee handbooks in the United States. It is common for employers to define what at-will employment means, explain that an employee’s at-will status cannot be changed except in a writing signed by the company president (or chief executive), and require that an employee sign <b>an</b> <b>acknowledgment</b> {{of his or her}} at-will status. However, the National Labor Relations Board has opposed as unlawful the practice of including in such disclaimers language declaring that the at-will nature of the employment cannot be changed without the written consent of senior management.|$|E
25|$|In TFTP, a {{transfer}} is {{initiated by the}} client issuing a request to read or write a particular file on the server. The request can optionally include a set of negotiated transfer parameters proposed by the client under the terms specified by RFC 2347. If the server grants the request, the file is sent in fixed length blocks of 512 bytes by default or the number specified in the blocksize negotiated option defined by RFC 2348. Each block of transferred data which is usually carried within a single IP packet {{in order to avoid}} IP fragmentation, must be acknowledged by <b>an</b> <b>acknowledgment</b> packet before the next block can be sent. A data packet of less than 512 bytes or the agreed blocksize option signals termination of {{a transfer}}. If a packet gets lost in the network, the intended recipient will timeout and may retransmit their last packet (which may be data or <b>an</b> <b>acknowledgment),</b> thus causing the sender of the lost packet to retransmit that lost packet. The sender has to keep just one packet on hand for retransmission, since the lock step acknowledgment guarantees that all older packets have been correctly received. Notice that both devices involved in a transfer are considered senders and receivers. One sends data and receives acknowledgments, the other sends acknowledgments and receives data.|$|E

25|$|In January 2011, Ventura filed {{a lawsuit}} against the Transportation Security Administration for being subject to {{controversial}} pat-downs. Ventura, who received a titanium hip replacement in 2008 that sets off metal detectors at airport security checkpoints, has asserted that these pat-downs violate citizens' Fourth Amendment rights. Ventura's attorney has claimed that while he is not seeking any monetary compensation, Ventura wants <b>an</b> <b>acknowledgment</b> from the court that his rights were violated and that the TSA halt future pat-downs on him. Ventura stated that as a former politician and a military veteran and posing no threat, it is inappropriate for him to be subject to pat-downs.|$|E
25|$|Animist beliefs {{can also}} be {{expressed}} through artwork. For instance, among the Maori communities of New Zealand, there is <b>an</b> <b>acknowledgment</b> that creating art through carving wood or stone entails violence against the wood or stone person, and that the persons who are damaged therefore have to be placated and respected during the process; any excess or waste from {{the creation of the}} artwork is returned to the land, while the artwork itself is treated with particular respect. Harvey therefore argued that the creation of art among the Maori was not about creating an inanimate object for display, but rather a transformation of different persons within a relationship.|$|E
