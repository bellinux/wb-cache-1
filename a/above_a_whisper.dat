Sarah's health began failing and {{physicians}} recommended a return to America. Sarah died en route at St. Helena on September 1, 1845. He continued home, where he was greeted as a celebrity and toured the eastern seaboard raising the profile of and money for missionary activity. Because he could barely speak <b>above</b> <b>a</b> <b>whisper,</b> due to pulmonary illness, his public addresses were made by speaking to an assistant, who would then address the audience.|$|E
500|$|Chappuis and his crewmates {{finally reached}} {{a home in}} the small town of Asola, Italy, in the Province of Mantua, Lombardy, about [...] from Milan. The German {{headquarters}} was two houses away, and the drill grounds were across the street. Accordingly, Chappuis and the other Americans could not walk near a window or talk <b>above</b> <b>a</b> <b>whisper.</b> They passed the time playing cards with each other and with the Ugolini family with whom they stayed, and reading a well-worn copy of Uncle Tom's Cabin. The Americans were nearly captured one evening when the Fascist fiancé of one of the Ugolini daughters entered the house unannounced and found the Americans playing cards. He threatened to turn the Americans in, but was persuaded not to when told it would mean the death of his fiancée and her family for aiding the Americans.|$|E
500|$|On September 5, 1931, {{he married}} Katherine Elizabeth [...] "Kay" [...] Hanson (1907–79), {{whom he had}} dated since high school, at Saint Malachy's Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan. They had two children: Therese O'Malley Seidler (born in 1933) and Peter O'Malley (born in 1937). Kay had been {{diagnosed}} with laryngeal cancer in 1927 before the engagement and had to have her larynx removed. She was unable to speak <b>above</b> <b>a</b> <b>whisper</b> the rest of her life. Edwin O'Malley encouraged Walter to break off his engagement, and after Walter refused his parents did not attend the wedding. O'Malley was a smoker, who golfed occasionally, but more commonly gardened for recreation. In 1944, he remodelled his parents' summer house in Amityville, New York and relocated his family there from Brooklyn. The house was next door to the house Kay had grown up and her parents lived next door.|$|E

6000|$|... "Some bread, Rose, if you please," [...] {{requested}} Martin, {{with intense}} gravity, serenity, phlegm. The boy had naturally a low, plaintive voice, which in his [...] "dour moods" [...] rose scarcely <b>above</b> <b>a</b> lady's <b>whisper.</b> The more inflexibly stubborn the humour, the softer, the sadder the tone.

500|$|Incorporating an ease to her vocal {{delivery}}, Del Rey eased her vocal delivery by crooning {{the hook}} [...] "Move baby, move baby / Ooh baby, ooh baby" [...] throughout the chorus shift, {{in a style}} that recalls Stevie Nicks' [...] "Edge of Seventeen" [...] (1982). Del Rey uses an inexpressive, ventriloquizing tone in the song, with her voice being layered into the track's production by means of reverberation. In addition, her vocals use a more sensual and sinister tone than in her previous discography, and are often sung in an anxious and [...] "breathy" [...] style, and in an octave just <b>above</b> <b>a</b> <b>whisper.</b> She also sings the track's backing vocals which in part contribute to the song's ethereal feel, through distant, faraway moans. MuuMuse's Bradley Stern observed that Del Rey's voice skipped between [...] "breathy franticness and slurred, drugged-out ecstasy". Throughout the song, she restrains her delivery during its verses, but sings in a sweeping, cinematic style in its chorus.|$|E

It {{was the first time}} they had seen daylight in two and a half years, and it burned their eyes at first.

Their vocal cords had atrophied because they had not spoken <b>above</b> <b>a</b> <b>whisper</b> during their entire confinement.|$|E
2500|$|Neither Flatt nor Scruggs {{spoke to}} each other for the next ten years — until 1979 when Flatt was in the hospital. Scruggs made an unannounced visit to the bedside. The two men talked for more than an hour. Even though Flatt's voice was barely <b>above</b> <b>a</b> <b>whisper,</b> he spoke of a reunion. Scruggs {{answered}} yes, but told Flatt they would talk when he was better. [...] Flatt said, [...] "It came as quite a surprise and made me feel good". But Lester Flatt never recovered, and died May 11, 1979. [...] Historian Barry Willis, speaking of the meeting, said [...] "Earl gave Lester his flowers while he was still living".|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Walter Phillips, who {{was present}} at two of the {{meetings}} in Jinzhou, wrote: [...] "It was at Chinchow that I first {{came into contact with}} the Revival. Meetings had been going on there for a week, hence, I was ushered into the heart of things unprepared, and in candour, I must add, with a strong temperamental prejudice against 'revival hysterics' in every form, so that mine is at least an unbiased witness. At once, on entering the church, one was conscious of something unusual. The place was crowded to the door, and tense, reverent attention sat on every face. The very singing was vibrant with new joy and vigour [...] [...] [...] The people knelt for prayer, silent at first, but soon one here and another there began to pray aloud. The voices grew and gathered volume and blended into a great wave of united supplication that swelled till it was almost a roar, and died down again into an undertone of weeping. Now I understood why the floor was so wet - [...] it was wet with pools of tears! The very air seemed electric -- I speak in all seriousness [...] - and strange thrills coursed up and down one's body. Then above the sobbing, in strained, choking tones, a man began to make public confession. Words of mine will fail to describe the awe and terror and pity of these confessions. It was not so much the enormity of the sins disclosed, or the depths of iniquity sounded, that shocked one[...] [...] [...] It was the agony of the penitent, his groans and cries, and voice shaken with sobs; it was the sight of men forced to their feet, and, in spite of their struggles, impelled, as it seemed, to lay bare their hearts that moved one and brought the smarting tears to one's own eyes. Never have I experienced anything more heart breaking, more nerve racking than the spectacle of those souls stripped naked before their fellows. So for hour after hour it went on, till the strain was almost more than the onlooker could bear. Now it was a big, strong farmer groveling on the floor, smiting his head on the bare boards as he wailed unceasingly, 'Lord! Lord!' Now a shrinking woman in a voice scarce <b>above</b> <b>a</b> <b>whisper,</b> now a wee laddie from the school, with the tears streaking his piteous grimy little face, as he sobbed out: 'I cannot love my enemies. Last week I stole a farthing from my teacher. I am always fighting and cursing. I beseech the pastor, elders and deacons to pray for me.' And then again would swell that wonderful deep organ tone of united prayer. And ever as the prayer sank again the ear caught a dull undertone of quiet sobbing, of desperate entreaty from men and women, who, lost to their surroundings, were wrestling for peace." ...|$|E

5|$|McKay {{stated that}} he {{believed}} Kimball could still serve as an apostle even if he underwent a complete laryngectomy and advised him {{to go forward with}} the procedure. Martin subsequently surgically removed one of Kimball's vocal cords and half of the other, leaving him barely able to speak <b>above</b> <b>a</b> hoarse <b>whisper.</b> After several weeks of enforced silence, Kimball slowly recovered, and by November 1957, he was allowed by his physician to resume speaking in public. Kimball's voice remained raspy throughout the rest of his life, and he usually wore an ear-mounted microphone to help magnify his voice, even when he was speaking at normal microphone-equipped pulpits.|$|R

5000|$|In early 1950, at age 55, Kimball, who {{had never}} smoked or used tobacco, began {{experiencing}} persistent hoarseness and, after a physical examination, underwent a biopsy of a white spot in his throat. The biopsy caused some brief voice impairment, and indicated that Kimball had a throat infection but not cancer. In late 1956, Kimball's hoarseness returned, coupled with occasional bleeding {{in the back of}} his throat. Kimball's physician sent him to New York City to meet with Dr. Hayes Martin (1892 - 1977), an expert on cancers of the head and neck. Martin performed another biopsy, which indicated [...] "borderline malignancy", and in early 1957 Martin recommended immediate surgery. Kimball had neglected to seek approval from church president David O. McKay regarding his 1957 biopsy, a procedure which in the 1950s could itself cause permanent vocal damage. He felt that as an apostle he should have sought McKay's approval before undergoing surgical procedures which could render him incapable of fulfilling apostolic duties. McKay stated that he believed Kimball could still serve as an apostle even if he underwent a complete laryngectomy, and advised him to go forward with the procedure. Martin subsequently surgically removed one of Kimball's vocal cords and half of the other, leaving him barely able to speak <b>above</b> <b>a</b> hoarse <b>whisper.</b> After several weeks of enforced silence, Kimball slowly recovered, and by November 1957 was allowed by his physician to resume speaking in public.

60|$|It was {{no doubt}} the {{anomalous}} state of affairs existing between us, which turned all my attacks upon him, (and they were many, either open or covert) into the channel of banter or practical joke (giving pain while assuming the aspect of mere fun) rather than into a more serious and determined hostility. But my endeavours on this head {{were by no means}} uniformly successful, even when my plans were the most wittily concocted; for my namesake had much about him, in character, of that unassuming and quiet austerity which, while enjoying the poignancy of its own jokes, has no heel of Achilles in itself, and absolutely refuses to be laughed at. I could find, indeed, but one vulnerable point, and that, lying in a personal peculiarity, arising, perhaps, from constitutional disease, would have been spared by any antagonist less at his wit's end than myself;--my rival had a weakness in the faucal or guttural organs, which precluded him from raising his voice at any time <b>above</b> <b>a</b> very low <b>whisper.</b> Of this defect I did not fall to take what poor advantage lay in my power.|$|R
