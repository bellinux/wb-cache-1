40|$|The {{significance}} of social presence in <b>asynchronous</b> <b>computer</b> conferencing {{has become an}} increasingly important factor in establishing high-quality online learning environments. Levels of social presence exhibited in <b>asynchronous</b> <b>computer</b> conferences influence students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of learning and satisfaction levels in a Web based course. Evidence in the literature supports the use of text-based <b>asynchronous</b> <b>computer</b> conferences to enhance learning in online learning environments. Recently, faculty teaching online courses have begun to use voice-based asynchronous conferencing tools with little research to support {{the appropriateness of the}} media. A quasi-experimental study design framed this examination of the levels of social presence as measured by interaction patterns in voice-based and text-based <b>asynchronous</b> <b>computer</b> conferences. Qualitative analysis of content transcripts representing voice based and text -based <b>asynchronous</b> <b>computer</b> conferences from one human physiology course at a state university located in the southeastern United States was examined in this study. The analysis was based on the affective, communicative reinforcement, and cohesive interactions as defined by Rourke, Anderson, Garrison, and Archer. A social density score was derived from transcripts. A multivariate analysis of variance was conducted to determine if there were significant differences in levels of social presence between voice-based and text-based <b>asynchronous</b> <b>computer</b> conferences. Results reported higher levels of affective and communicative reinforcement interactions in the text-based <b>asynchronous</b> <b>computer</b> conferences at a statistically significant level. Voice-based <b>asynchronous</b> <b>computer</b> conferences contained higher levels of cohesive interaction patterns, although levels were not statistically significant. Deployment of voice-based technology as a pedagogical tool is delivered at a considerable cost to higher education institutions. These tools are often marketed based on the effectiveness of the technology in a learning environment. However, according to this study, there is no apparent benefit in using voice-based rather than text-based technology tools to facilitate <b>asynchronous</b> <b>computer</b> conferences in a Web-based learning environment...|$|E

The aim is to document and understand the kinds of task related postings in <b>asynchronous</b> <b>computer</b> conferencing that foster knowledge construction. The tool for analysis is an adaptation of the model by Veerman and Veldhuis-Diermanse (2001). Data were collected from Quickplace, the e-learning system at Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, with 22 adult postgraduate students enrolled in the Masters of Science in Human Resource Development who were attending a 14 -week course on Cognition and Learning. The results showed that the students were active in constructing knowledge but limited to seeking and giving opinions among peers and knowledge telling. The prevalence of low level knowledge construction points to the need for the e-learning facilitator to encourage the students to go beyond regurgitating facts of what they have learned. More guidance should be given to the students to refrain from mere knowledge telling. Results suggest that there are blended learning benefits for these students as they are given improved opportunities to learn outside the classroom...|$|E

40|$|<b>Asynchronous</b> <b>computer</b> {{conferencing}} {{is playing}} {{an increasingly important}} role in distance education, especially in higher education, by affording opportunities for in depth and meaningful learning. Working within a qualitative paradigm, a multiple-case study was conducted of three online <b>asynchronous</b> <b>computer</b> conferences at Nova Southeastern University 2 ̆ 7 s Graduate School of Computer and Information Sciences. The study examined the learning process in these conferences from the points of view of interaction, cognition and discourse analysis. Cognition was assessed using three models: Bloom 2 ̆ 7 s Taxonomy (Bloom, Engelhart, Furst, Hill, 2 ̆ 6 Krathwohl, 1956), the SOLO Taxonomy (Biggs 2 ̆ 6 Collis, 1982) and Garrison, Anderson and Archer 2 ̆ 7 s (2001) Practical Inquiry Model of Cognitive Presence. The learning interactions, based on the verbal data from the conferencing transcripts, were mapped and visually depicted. A number of thread types were identified, which {{became the basis for}} comparisons of the cognitive and discourse components within each case. The interactions were also analyzed using a modified version of Henri 2 ̆ 7 s (1992) Analytical Model for the Interactive Dimension. Levels of cognition in all three conferences were characterized by higher-order thinking. Synergistic interaction in the conference threads was associated with higher levels of cognition than other types of interaction, pointing to the importance of the collaborative element in learning. Discourse analysis of the first conference, the main case study, showed that the facilitation of learning was a function of the student-student and student-teacher exchanges arising from the instructor 2 ̆ 7 s moderation. In the second case, a conference that had no formal instructor intervention, the learning interactions were found {{to be related to the}} way in which the instructor had structured the instructional task and by the student -student exchanges triggered by the task. The analysis of the third case revealed patterns relating to the role of informal student moderation. At the interpretive level of the study, which was based on numerical and statistical analysis, emerging patterns were described within each case and across the three cases.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{an era of}} {{constant}} educational reforms, many acknowledge teachers’ professional development as the keystone to educational improvement. The issue of whether teachers’ development is adequate has been crucial in all times, especially now that professional education faces a number of challenges due to the rapid technological development {{and the need for}} lifelong learning incited by globalization of world economies. Nevertheless, although common acceptance exists that reflective practice is a key ingredient for professional development, the art of cultivating reflection in the context of CPD requires further attention. A review of the literature shows a long history on research that embraces a wide range of strategies that argue to promote teacher reflection. However, there is unclear evidence about whether reflective thinking – as a meaningful professional objective – may be promoted through collaborative computer mediated discourse. What’s more, although there is a plethora of assessment tools that claim to assess reflexivity, very few authors exemplify the theoretical framework underpinning the notion of reflection employed in their studies. The purpose of this study has been to examine whether, and if yes how, reflective thinking is promoted through collaborative <b>asynchronous</b> <b>computer</b> mediated communication by comparison with traditional face to face discourse. A case study using a comparative method was employed to analyze the electronic discourse by comparison with the face to face dialogue of twenty post 16 education practitioners in the UK. Research design considerations and implications related to what constitutes evidence of reflection and how it may be represented for the purposes of reporting on research outputs are also critically examined. The results lend support to the view that, although reflective outcomes can be accomplished in an <b>asynchronous</b> <b>computer</b> mediated communication, the recurring theme of storytelling observed in the face to face discourse appears to cultivate and influence the depth of reflexivity achieved. ...|$|E
40|$|The problem {{motivating}} {{this research}} is that ineffective communication may hamper systems development efforts. Specifically germane to this study are development efforts characterized as task-oriented, and which require information-sharing and problem-solving activities. This research problem motivated {{an analysis of the}} communication process and lead {{to the development of a}} temporal framework that delineates variables associated with task-oriented, end user/systems analyst communication interactions. Several variables within this framework are depicted in two theoretical models. The first model shows the theoretical relationship between an independent variable, communication mode (represented by <b>asynchronous</b> <b>computer</b> conferencing and face-to-face conferencing), and five dependent variables: (1) the amount of information shared, (2) the significance of the information shared, (3) the comprehensiveness of the information shared, (4) the perception of progress toward the goal, and (5) the perception of freedom to participate. The second model depicts the assumed interaction between communication mode, the five variables cited above (now acting as independent variables), and a dependent variable, communication quality. There are two theoretical components of communication quality: (1) deviation from an optimal set of user requirements, and (2) the degree of convergence (unity based on mutual understanding and mutual agreement) emanating from a communication interaction. Using the theoretical models as a guide, an experiment was designed and performed to test the relationships among the variables. The experimental results led to the rejection of all null hypotheses; the results strongly favored face-to-face conferencing for solving task-oriented, information-sharing problems analagous to the case used in the present study. The findings indicate that <b>asynchronous</b> <b>computer</b> conferencing may have a detrimental effect on the thoroughness of information exchange, on the relevance of the information shared in terms of making the correct decision, and on the completeness of the consideration given to all problem dimensions...|$|E

As {{has been reported in}} previous papers (Grodzinsky, Griffin & Jefferies, 2002; Griffin, Grodzinsky & Jefferies, 2002) such use has proved to be extremely valuable for supporting the teaching of computing and ethics. For example, not only does <b>asynchronous</b> <b>computer</b> conferencing offer new opportunities for students to gain valuable first-hand experience in using such technology to communicate with peers in other countries but it also facilitates them gaining a more direct appreciation of the cultural, legal and ethical differences that abound. However, the setting up of successful ‘virtual’ communities with campus-based final year undergraduates based in three different countries posed a number of issues that had to be addressed prior to implementation. Prime amongst these were concerns as to how to overcome some of the perceived barriers to establishing effective groups within a text-based virtual environment across international boundaries and how to integrate use of the technology within the traditional face-to-face context of learning. This paper will, therefore, report on how this blended approach to learning and teaching was developed and implemented using the Belbin Self-Perception Inventory (1981). It will then report on research undertaken into the impact that this strategy had on how individuals actually operated within their teams in the virtual environment. It will also detail some of the findings from this case study when these perceived Belbin types were matched with transaction analysis (Wortham, 1999) and types of messages posted (Garrison, Anderson & Archer, 2001).
