The unique features of the radiotracer method are demonstrated at example of the determination of heavy metal release at a {{municipal solid waste incineration}} process. Zinc was chosen as a representative of a more or less volatile heavy metal and copper as a representative of a hardly evaporable one for the prupose of investigations. With the help of the short-lived isotopes 69 mZn(13. 8 h holf. life) and 64 Cu (12. 7 h half-life) of the selected heavy metals it was possible to detect the location, time and amount evaporated. Since the isotopes used are gamma-emitters, <b>all</b> <b>measured</b> <b>data</b> could be collected without direct contact and sampling-free. The determination of the evaporation location took place using 11 Nal(TI) -scintillation detectors positioned detector positioned along the forward-acting grate; the acquisition of the evaporation rate data ensued with the help of detector located within an absorber positioned to wash the flue gas flow. The measuring results are discussed regarding to the influence of different processing conditions on the evaporation behavior. An outlook is given on upcoming applications of the radiotracer technique in the field of the exploitation and optimization of environmental technology processes.

40|$|Small {{deformations}} of hard {{materials are}} characterized by elastic modulus E. For characterization of elastomers a stress at given strain is commonly used. This value is obtained from one measured point on the stress-strain curve. For characterization of tensile behaviour of elastomers we have used here a specific deformation energy in tension between zero and the chosen strain. The coefficients of variation of the measured specific deformation energies were reasonably low. The main advantage of using the specific deformation energy (instead of stress at given strain) {{is the fact that}} this value is obtained directly from <b>all</b> <b>measured</b> <b>data</b> between zero and the chosen strain.

40|$|Abstract — To reduce energy consumption, {{aggregation}} {{takes place}} in a wireless sensor network. <b>All</b> <b>measured</b> <b>data</b> is collected and preprocessed multiple times on its way towards a data sink, e. g., a base station. However, aggregation implies new challenges to security: as the sink finally receives aggregated data, it is difficult to verify not only the aggregate’s correctness, but also the origin of the data the aggregate was computed from. In the presence of an attacker in the network, data transmissions and aggregation could have maliciously been modified. Yet, it turns out that in-network aggregation and data authenticity are contradictory communication properties. This research examines the possibility of finding a trade-off between security (authenticity) and energy-savings (aggregation). If the user is willing to accept data’s authenticity with p ≤ 100 % probability, he can still save large amounts of energy compared to authentic communication without aggregation. I...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{develop and}} test {{a set of}} process {{measures}} of quality of care in the reassessment of inpatient empirical antibiotic prescriptions, to determine the inter-rater reliability of medical notes’ review in assessment of these measures and to test these measures on one ward. Methods: Measures of process of care were identified from a literature review. Forty sets of medical notes were reviewed by two independent doctors and the inter-rater reliability determined using observed percentage agreement and the kappa statistic. These measures were collected weekly and fed back to doctors in order to stimulate improvement. Results: Four process measures were identified and were grouped {{together to create a}} ‘day 3 bundle’: antibiotic plan, review of the diagnosis, adaptation to microbiology and intravenous–oral switch. The inter-rater agreement was 80 % for <b>all</b> <b>measures.</b> <b>Data</b> collection was feasible and was easily sus-tained over several weeks. The reassessment of antibiotic prescriptions around day 3 was better docu-mented using real-time feedback of the measures to the medical team.

30|$|Commonly [3, 4], to {{evaluate}} classifier performance, the classification dataset {{is divided into}} two subsets of the same size. One subset is used as a training dataset and the other as a testing dataset. The disadvantage of such an approach is that the classification probability rates might vary if the small original dataset is split in a different manner. To obtain more accurate and reliable classification results, the K= 11 cross-validation technique is applied. The initial data under analysis are split into K subsets of the same length, and K− 1 subsets are used as a training dataset, and the remaining one as a testing dataset. The cross-validation process is repeated K− 1 times (K− 1 folds) with each of the K subsets used as a testing dataset. The K results from the folds are averaged {{to evaluate}} a single estimation.
