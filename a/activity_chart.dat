The chart can also be color-coded to convey information; for example, The time column is used to specify the activity of the worker and the machine, if the column is shaded with black color, it indicates that the worker or the machine is performing an operation, while if it is shaded with gray color, it refers to inspection. For moving, it is customary [...] to refer to it with diagonal lines, whereas horizontal lines indicate a holding activity. If the column is blank then the worker or the machine is idle. For some other uses, there is a same version to accommodate enormous worker-machine interactions, called the multiple worker-multiple machine <b>activity</b> <b>chart.</b>|$|E

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) supports a set of semantics and notation that addresses all scales of architectural complexity by using a MDD perspective. Use Cases and <b>Activity</b> <b>Charts</b> are two modeling techniques of the UML. The first one helps the designers to identify {{the requirements of the}} system discovering its high level functionality. The second one helps them to specify the internal behaviour of a certain entity or subsystem of the software developed, such as a database, a graphical interface, a software component, or any specific software. However, there is not a direct way to relate/model the requirements (use cases) with their internal behavior (<b>activity</b> <b>charts).</b> In this paper we present a method for describing use cases with <b>activity</b> <b>charts.</b> Our technique also allow us to identify the two main use case relationships —include and generalization — by means of <b>activity</b> <b>charts.</b> As a case study, we will show how to use the <b>activity</b> <b>charts</b> to describe graphical user interfaces (GUI) from use cases.

40|$|Learned {{helplessness}} {{theory and}} its subsequent reformulation propose that a pessimistic explanatory style renders an individual vulnerable to depression. A {{large body of}} literature has supported this association within various samples and utilising a range of methodologies. No prior study has explored explanatory style and depression among a New Zealand sample of clinically depressed adults. Furthermore, no prior research has examined the role of activity level or activity type in relation to these variables. Given the importance of behavioural activation in recovery from depression, Study 1 aimed to bridge this gap. The sample consisted of 29 adult clients diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and receiving a 20 session protocol of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) as part of The Depression Study; a treatment outcome study conducted at Massey University, Albany, Auckland, New Zealand. Data were derived from intake assessment scores for explanatory style and depression severity, as measured via the Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ) and Beck Depression Inventory–Second Edition (BDI-II) respectively. Data were also derived from several activity level and activity type indices formulated for Study 1 {{by the use of}} information contained within activity charts; a tool used for a between-session task (homework) conducted early in CBT. Study 1 supported an association between a pessimistic explanatory style and depression severity and provisional support was found for the proposed model of the current project, implicating the role of activity among interactions between explanatory style and depression. In collecting data for Study 1 it became apparent that an adaptation to the <b>activity</b> <b>chart</b> may yield greater information particularly with regard to activity type, such as the extent to which social interaction occurred. Study 2 of the current research project aimed to compare the original <b>activity</b> <b>chart</b> with the adapted chart, by grouping The Depression Study clients according to whether they completed the original (n = 15) or the adapted (n = 8) <b>activity</b> <b>chart,</b> and comparing the data obtained. Mann-Whitney U tests confirmed that the adapted chart was more successful in collecting information regarding social interaction and ratings for mastery and pleasure. It is suggested that the adapted chart could be more beneficial in contrast to the chart typically used in CBT to date; this advantage could extend across both research and clinical settings for the examination of client activity...|$|E

Currently, much of the focus has been on the use of factory-built structural components, which reflects the inherent characteristics of the residential construction industry that medium and large homebuilders construct high volumes of houses with a similar structure. However, many such attempts failed due to operation management problems. This paper presents a hybrid approach that combines process flowcharting and simulation for helping prefabricators analyze and improve their production process.

We identified local physical activities through in-depth interviews, group discussions, and observation, and used Actigraph GT 3 X accelerometers to validate the modified GPAQ for a subsample of 47 women. Participants were drawn from a cross-sectional survey of 1, 303 women aged 18 to 64 years, selected by multistage cluster sampling. Spearman rank correlation coefficients and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to determine the correlation and level of agreement in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) on the basis of accelerometer measurement and the modified GPAQ.

To date most work has focused upon building algorithmic models of effort. The Prototype Project Management Tool with COCOMO calibration system (PPMT) implements a set of project management tools and CO COMO estimation ability that based on Boehm's CO COMO model, estimate project efforts in terms of staff and time. The underlying principle is to characterize projects in terms of features (for example, development method, staff capabilities, {{the size of the}} project in terms of thousand lines of code). Activity bar chart, network <b>activity</b> <b>chart</b> and staff allocation can be generated for the specified project. Typically the PPMT project allows its COCOMO sub-system to be calibrated to local environments. Thus the same project can have some estimate the first time it is evaluated and then a more accurate estimate the second time it is evaluated. The process is automated using an X-based tool that can be used by project managers to complement current estimation techniques. 1 bound copy: 73 leaves; ill. available at RNL...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{enhancing}} the performance utilization of locos by uncovering the non-value adding activities in raw material unloading yard (RMUY) {{of an integrated}} steel plant. JSW Steel Ltd, Vijayanagar works is the India’s first 10 MTPA steel plant at single location, “the fastest growing steel plant in India”. The capacity expansion of steel industry involves expansion of the production capacity {{at different stages of}} steel making like Raw material handling system, Treatment plants, Iron making, Steel making, Casting, & Rolling mills. At present Cold Rolling Mill- 2 and Steel Making Shop- 3 are going to be commissioned shortly. Hence with the expansion of the steel plant, the demand for raw materi-als will increase which will increase the number of inbound rakes arriving at RMUY. The increase in number of rakes arriving at RMUY causes congestion at the tracks causing bottlenecks for the unloading facilities and limits the rake movements within RMUY. The external railway agency providing the rail service, charges for demurrage (delay in return of rakes beyond 8 hr of free unloading time). Thus such bottlenecks not only adversely affect the unloading capabilities of the yard, but also increase the demurrage costs. Using Work Measurement Technique, 24 hr Time study has been conducted in raw material unloading yard of JSW Steel Ltd, to estimate the existing utilization of nine locos simultaneously three shifts per day.

Due to inefficiencies of the inventory management, {{it is necessary to}} improve them related with providing good information and data management. The main problem is miss information related with early warning system of lifetime products. They often have unsold inventory grocery products as impact of expired date. This journal analyzes a system to find out the need for system, then designs the system based on the system requirement obtained from the analysis. The information system of store room area grocery product is designed by using an object-oriented approach and UML modeling language to identify the actor, to make the system use case, to model the business process using the <b>activity</b> <b>chart,</b> to make interaction scheme using sequence diagram and to identify class. In the designing stage, this database and interface design is made. After database and interface design, the next stage is to make the program code by considering the use case and interaction diagrams that are made previously in modeling the object-oriented system. The result of this research consists of input constituting login form, product, suppliers, unit, category, action, location, and personnel data, addition, withdrawal, and action transactions, searching for product data, personnel data, location data and report input. Meanwhile the output constitutes withdrawal list, increment, product early earning reports approaching the expired date, product list, location list, personnel list, stock op name checklist, and the product master label. The outputs of the information system are reports and documents in monitor screen view and in printing. The validation showed that the information system designed can support the early warning system of expired date of grocery products in store room area.

40|$|Advances in {{workplace}} based {{physical activity}} programmes {{have been observed}} worldwide, however, minimal research {{has been carried out}} on workplace based programmes in New Zealand. Physical activity is an important modifiable risk factor for conditions such as CVD, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Physical inactivity is a significant risk factor, approximately half of New Zealand adults are recorded as physically inactive. Promoting health in the workplace increases the chances of health and well-being. Studies on workplaces that incorporate health and wellness initiatives including physical activity programmes, demonstrate lower health care costs and absenteeism and an overall improvement in physical and mental health, job performance, motivation and productivity. This study examined the self-reported physical activity outcomes obtained by a sub group of individuals who participated in the 2007 Sea 2 Sea Challenge, and the extent of support provided by their workplace. The Sea 2 Sea Challenge is a six-week workplace physical activity initiative run annually in Christchurch, by Sport Canterbury, which is now in its seventh year. This study is based on data gathered during and after the Sea 2 Sea Challenge. Both individual and workplace data were obtained on participation in, and impact of, the programme. A self-report physical <b>activity</b> <b>chart</b> was filled out by individual participants in the programme. Online and paper questionnaires were also sent to each workplace and filled out by the workplace coordinator, including information on workplace support. Over the study period 3, 732 individuals from 114 workplaces participated in the Sea 2 Sea Challenge. Of the 3, 732 total participants, 688 (18. 4 %) participants filled out and returned the self-report physical activity cards and 54 out of 114 (47. 4 %) workplace coordinators completed the online/paper questionnaire. These data were subsequently analysed using SPSS software and issues examined include factors associated with levels of individual and workplace participation {{and the extent to which}} workplaces supported the Sea 2 Sea programme. Some key findings include: The Sea 2 Sea Challenge has maintained a steady increase in the number of workplaces taking part each year since 2004. From 2005 to 2007, there was approximately a 30 % increase in workplaces participating each year. Of the participants who completed the physical activity self-report chart, 70 % met the recommended level of activity of 30 minutes each day over six weeks, despite the often low levels of support provided by the workplace and/or workplace coordinator. Although the programme is only short term, the Sea 2 Sea Challenge demonstrates the potential of the programme as a successful workplace intervention in the Canterbury region, particularly for a sub-group of people that reported high levels of physical activity. From the perspective of health promotion targeted to the working population this is a significant and low cost short term outcome for a substantial group. However, the long-term effects of the intervention are not known. The study affirms the potential value of the workplace as a useful setting for health promotion and has also indicated the need for a more extensive evaluation of the effectiveness of such a workplace based health promotion programme. The strengths and the limitations of this study are discussed along with implications for successful implementation of workplace based physical activity programmes in general...|$|E
