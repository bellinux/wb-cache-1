5|$|Because at {{any given}} point on Earth the weight of <b>an</b> <b>object</b> is {{proportional}} to its mass, the mass of <b>an</b> <b>object</b> in kilograms is usually measured by comparing its weight to {{the weight of a}} standard mass, whose mass is known in kilograms, using a device called a weighing scale. The ratio of the force of gravity on the two objects, measured by the scale, is equal to the ratio of their masses.|$|E

30|$|Aggregation {{indicates}} {{the formation of}} <b>a</b> particular <b>object</b> as <b>a</b> result of one <b>object</b> built as <b>a</b> collection. In aggregation, the contained objects are not strongly dependent on {{the life cycle of}} the container. There are 2 aggregation links between <b>a</b> Drug <b>object</b> and <b>an</b> ATC <b>object,</b> and between <b>a</b> Gene <b>object</b> and <b>a</b> SNP <b>object.</b> <b>A</b> Drug <b>object</b> is made up of none or more ATC codes. And <b>a</b> Gene <b>object</b> is made up of one or more SNPs.|$|R
30|$|Association {{indicates}} any {{logical connection}} or relationship between objects. There are 3 association links among <b>a</b> Drug <b>object,</b> <b>a</b> Gene <b>object,</b> <b>a</b> Disease <b>object</b> and <b>a</b> SideEffect <b>object.</b> One disease contains zero to many drugs. One drug contains zero to many side effects. And one drug contains one to many genes.|$|R
5|$|Joint {{attention}} or shared attention is the shared focus of two individuals on <b>an</b> <b>object.</b> It is achieved when one individual alerts another to <b>an</b> <b>object</b> {{by means of}} eye-gazing, pointing or other verbal or non-verbal indications. An individual gazes at another individual, points to <b>an</b> <b>object</b> and then returns their gaze to the individual. Scaife and Bruner were the first researchers to present a cross-sectional description of children's ability to follow eye gaze in 1975. They found that most eight- to ten-month-old children followed a line of regard, and that all 11- to 14-month-old children did so. This early research showed {{it was possible for}} an adult to bring certain objects in the environment to an infant's attention using eye gaze.|$|E

2500|$|An {{inductive}} {{definition of}} dimension {{can be created}} as follows. Consider a discrete set of points (such as a finite collection of points) to be 0-dimensional. By dragging <b>a</b> 0-dimensional <b>object</b> in some direction, one obtains <b>a</b> 1-dimensional <b>object.</b> By dragging <b>a</b> 1-dimensional <b>object</b> in <b>a</b> new direction, one obtains <b>a</b> 2-dimensional <b>object.</b> In general one obtains <b>an</b> (...) -dimensional <b>object</b> by dragging <b>an</b> -dimensional <b>object</b> in <b>a</b> new direction.|$|R

The topic and subject are noun phrases, predicates are verb phrases and another noun phrase acting as <b>an</b> <b>object</b> or verbal attribute often follows the predicate.|$|E
5|$|A planet's {{defining}} {{physical characteristic}} {{is that it}} is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic forces binding its physical structure, leading to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. Up to a certain mass, <b>an</b> <b>object</b> can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull <b>an</b> <b>object</b> towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.|$|E

We detect, {{in the context of}} <b>an</b> <b>object's</b> surroundings, the characteristics of the fixed physical property and, from there, the lightness remains constant despite vast changes.

5|$|An infant's social {{environment}} relates {{to his or}} her later language development. Children's first words are closely linked to their early language experience. For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object the child is focusing on. In children with delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on. Infants are {{more likely to engage in}} joint attention when the parent talks about <b>an</b> <b>object</b> that the child is attending to as opposed to <b>an</b> <b>object</b> outside of the infant's attention. This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production. When joint attention is present, it plays an important role in word learning, a crucial aspect of language development.|$|E
5|$|Angular motions (or rotary motions) {{occur when}} <b>an</b> <b>object</b> is around another object {{increasing}} or decreasing the angle. The {{different parts of}} the object do not move the same distance. Examples include a movement of the knee, where the lower leg changes angle compared to the femur, or movements of the ankle.|$|E
5|$|Any {{class that}} {{fulfills}} the allocator requirements {{can be used}} as an allocator. In particular, a class A capable of allocating memory for <b>an</b> <b>object</b> of type T must provide the types A::pointer, A::const_pointer, A::reference, A::const_reference, and A::value_type for generically declaring objects and references (or pointers) to objects of type T. It should also provide type A::size_type, an unsigned type which can represent the largest size for <b>an</b> <b>object</b> in the allocation model defined by A, and similarly, a signed integral A::difference_type that can represent the difference between any two pointers in the allocation model.|$|E

50|$|The State {{property}} describes <b>an</b> <b>object's</b> status at <b>a</b> {{moment in}} time. Microsoft Active Accessibility provides object state constants, defined in oleacc.h, that are combined to identify <b>an</b> <b>object's</b> state.

40|$|Abstract — Existing {{prediction}} {{methods in}} moving objects databases cannot forecast locations accurately if the query time is {{far away from}} the current time. Even for near future prediction, most techniques assume the trajectory of <b>an</b> <b>object’s</b> movements can be represented by some mathematical formulas of motion functions based on its recent movements. However, <b>an</b> <b>object’s</b> movements are more complicated than what the mathematical formulas can represent. Prediction based on <b>an</b> <b>object’s</b> trajectory patterns is a powerful way and has been investigated by several work. But their main interest is how to discover the patterns. In this paper, we present a novel prediction approach, namely The Hybrid Prediction Model, which estimates <b>an</b> <b>object’s</b> future locations based on its pattern information as well as existing motion functions using the object’s recent movements. Specifically, <b>an</b> <b>object’s</b> trajectory patterns which have ad-hoc forms for prediction are discovered and then indexed by a novel access method for efficient query processing. In addition, two query processing techniques that can provide accurate results for both near and distant time predictive queries are presented. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that proposed techniques are more accurate and efficient than existing forecasting schemes. I...|$|R
