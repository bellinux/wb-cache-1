5|$|On 16 July 1964, Vulcan B.1A XA909 {{crashed in}} Anglesey after a midair {{explosion}} caused both No. 3 and No. 4 engines {{to be shut}} down. The explosion was caused by failure of a bearing in No. 4 engine. The starboard wing was extensively damaged, the pilot had insufficient aileron power, and both airspeed indications were highly inaccurate. The whole crew successfully abandoned XA909 and were found within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> rescued.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Namu {{developed a}} bacterial infection which damaged his nervous system, {{causing him to}} become nonresponsive to people. During his illness he charged full-speed into the wire mesh of his pen, thrashed violently for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> then died.|$|E
25|$|Some floods develop slowly, {{while others}} such as flash floods, can develop in just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> without visible signs of rain. Additionally, floods can be local, {{impacting}} a neighborhood or community, or very large, affecting entire river basins.|$|E

25|$|Rice bran is {{sometimes}} {{added to the}} guano {{for the purpose of}} exfoliation. The powder is mixed with water yielding a paste. The paste is massaged into the skin for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> then it is rinsed off. The facial is usually rather odorless and sanitized. The added rice bran can also neutralize the slight musky odor.|$|E
25|$|The {{ceremony}} {{began with}} a race between the track-layers and crews from the eastern and western ends of construction. The last mile had been left unfinished and each crew was timed to see who could complete their last half mile the fastest. The eastern crew won {{by a margin of}} only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> then the western crew placed the last rail.|$|E

25|$|Police placed Chikatilo under {{surveillance}} on 14 November. In several instances, particularly on trains or buses, he was observed approaching lone young women or children, and engaging them in conversation. If the woman or child broke off the conversation, Chikatilo would wait <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> then seek another conversation partner. On 20 November, after {{six days of}} surveillance, Chikatilo left his house with a large jar, which he had filled with beer at a small kiosk in a local park, before he wandered around Novocherkassk, attempting {{to make contact with}} children he met on his way. Upon exiting a cafe, Chikatilo was arrested by four plainclothes police officers.|$|E
25|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD), {{also known as}} ischemic heart disease (IHD), {{is a group of}} {{diseases}} that includes: stable angina, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death. It is within the group of cardiovascular diseases of which it is the most common type. A common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Occasionally it may feel like heartburn. Usually symptoms occur with exercise or emotional stress, last less than <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> <b>and</b> get better with rest. Shortness of breath may also occur and sometimes no symptoms are present. Occasionally, the first sign is a heart attack. Other complications include heart failure or an irregular heartbeat.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{believed}} that on June 12, 1892, Antonio Vélez Alvarado was at his apartment at 219 Twenty-Third Street in Manhattan, when he stared at a Cuban flag for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> <b>and</b> then {{took a look at}} the blank wall in which it was being displayed. Vélez suddenly perceived an optical illusion, in which he perceived the image of the Cuban flag with the colors in the flag's triangle and stripes inverted. Almost immediately he visited a nearby merchant, Domingo Peraza, from whom he bought some crepe paper to build a crude prototype. He later displayed his prototype in a dinner meeting at his neighbor's house, where the owner, Micaela Dalmau vda. de Carreras, had invited José Martí as a guest.|$|E

Martí was pleasantly impressed by the prototype, and made note of it in a newspaper article published in the Cuban revolutionary newspaper Patria, published on July 2 of that year. Acceptance of the prototype was slow in coming, but grew with time.|$|E
25|$|Genie's father fed Genie {{as little}} as {{possible}} and refused to give her solid food, feeding her only baby food, cereal, Pablum, an occasional soft-boiled egg, and liquids. Her father, or when coerced her brother, spooned food into her mouth as quickly as possible, and if she choked or could not swallow fast enough the person feeding her rubbed her face in her food. These were normally the only times he allowed his wife to be with Genie, although she could not feed Genie herself. Genie's mother claimed her husband always fed Genie three times a day but also said that Genie sometimes risked a beating by making noise when hungry, leading researchers to believe he often refused to feed her. In early 1972 Genie's mother told researchers that at night, when possible, at around 11 PM she surreptitiously tried to give Genie additional food, causing Genie to develop an abnormal sleep pattern in which she slept from 7 to 11 PM, woke up for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> <b>and</b> fell back asleep for an additional 6 hours. This pattern continued for several months after removal from captivity.|$|E
25|$|The faster {{a vessel}} travels, the more energy it uses. Reaching high speed {{requires}} energy which a human-powered vessel {{is incapable of}} producing. Oar system generate very low amounts of energy for propulsion (only about 70 W per rower) and the upper limit for rowing in a fixed position is around 10 knots. Ancient war galleys of the kind used in Classical Greece are by modern historians {{considered to be the}} most energy efficient and fastest of galley designs throughout history. A full-scale replica of a 5th-century BC trireme, the Olympias was built 1985–87 and was put through a series of trials to test its performance. It proved that a cruising speed of 7-8 knots could be maintained for an entire day. Sprinting speeds of up to 10 knots were possible, but only for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> would tire the crew quickly. Ancient galleys were built very light and the original triremes are assumed to never have been surpassed in speed. Medieval galleys are believed to have been considerably slower, especially since they were not built with ramming tactics in mind. A cruising speed of no more than 2-3 knots has been estimated. A sprint speed of up to 7 knots was possible for 20–30 minutes, but risked exhausting the rowers completely.|$|E

500|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog is a large, stout frog; adults range from [...] in length; typical {{specimens}} measure [...] The green and golden bell frog is therefore {{one of the}} largest Australian frogs. Mature males are generally smaller than mature females, and the colour on their dorsal surfaces differ greatly from females. It may be almost completely green, of shades from dark pea-green to bright emerald, green with metallic, brassy, dull copper-brown, or gold markings; or almost completely bronze. Generally, females tend to have more green patches than males. During the cooler months (May–August), when the frogs are inactive, colouration may darken almost to black. They can also darken in this way by simply staying in a dark place for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> <b>and</b> the colour can also change during the frogs' lifetimes.|$|E
500|$|Assuming {{it was a}} {{legitimate}} checkpoint, McCoy informed the others inside the minibus of a military checkpoint up ahead and pulled in at the lay-by as directed by the armed men. As McCoy {{rolled down the window}} and produced his driving licence, gunmen came up to the minibus and one of them said in a Northern Irish accent, [...] "Goodnight, fellas. How are things? Can you step out of the van for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> we'll just do a check". The unsuspecting band members got out and were politely told to line up facing the ditch {{at the rear of the}} minibus with their hands on their heads. More uniformed men appeared from out of the darkness, their guns pointed at the minibus. About 10 gunmen were at the checkpoint, according to author and journalist Martin Dillon.|$|E
500|$|After a {{dramatic}} Atlantic Ocean recovery, Commander Shepard observed that he [...] "...didn't really feel {{the flight was}} a success until the recovery had been successfully completed. It's not the fall that hurts; it's the sudden stop." [...] Splashdown occurred with an impact comparable to landing a jet aircraft on an aircraft carrier. A recovery helicopter arrived after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> <b>and</b> [...] the capsule was lifted partly {{out of the water}} to allow Shepard to leave by the main hatch. He squeezed out of the door and into a sling hoist, and was pulled into the helicopter, which flew both the astronaut and spacecraft to the aircraft carrier [...] The whole recovery process took just eleven minutes. Shepard was celebrated as a national hero, honored with ticker-tape parades in Washington, New York and Los Angeles, and received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President John F. Kennedy. He was also awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E

500|$|As Gaga {{performed}} on The Monster Ball Tour, Garibay {{started working on}} {{the music of the}} song. After the show was over, Gaga came back to her studio bus and asked him about the progress. Garibay then explained that he had concocted a different kind of music for the song, and played the church-bell inspired music to Gaga. After first hearing it, the singer said that she started to cry, noticing the vastness of the music, and she started writing the lyrics for [...] "Marry the Night". [...] "Marry the Night" [...] was originally recorded on the Bus Studio in 2010, but was later mixed at The Mix Room in Burbank, California by Dave Russell, assisted by Paul Pavao. Gaga described the song as a [...] "massive, gas-station, disco record", and she recorded it immediately after completing the lyrics. According to Garibay, Gaga meditated for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> then asked him to hand over a recording microphone to her, completing the process within an hour.|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} Laverdure ordered one company of his Senegalese {{infantry}} {{to leave the}} column with a convoy of wounded soldiers which he sent back to Khénifra. [...] However many of his other troops, seeing the Senegalese leaving, broke ranks and followed in panic. [...] Laverdure attempted to continue his withdrawal but, just having crossed the Chbouka river, his rearguard was surrounded and attacked repeatedly from all sides, being quickly overrun. [...] The gun batteries soon suffered the same fate, their crews also being killed. [...] The Zaian assembled on the ridges surrounding the remaining French troops, who had formed a defensive square, before launching a final attack with [...] "several thousand" [...] men. [...] This attack lasted just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>and,</b> after a desperate struggle, the square was broken and {{the remainder of the}} column was wiped out. [...] The Zaian chased down and killed any of the survivors who attempted to hide in the scrub.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn in December 1938 (and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner) generated intense interest among physicists. Bohr brought {{the news to}} the United States where he opened the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics with Fermi on 26 January 1939. When Bohr told George Placzek that this resolved all the mysteries of transuranic elements, Placzek told him that one remained: the neutron capture energies of uranium did not match those of its decay. Bohr {{thought about it for}} <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> then announced to Placzek, Léon Rosenfeld and John Wheeler that [...] "I have understood everything." [...] Based on his liquid drop model of the nucleus, Bohr concluded that it was the uranium-235 isotope and not the more abundant uranium-238 that was primarily responsible for fission with thermal neutrons. In April 1940, John R. Dunning demonstrated that Bohr was correct. In the meantime, Bohr and Wheeler developed a theoretical treatment which they published in a September 1939 paper on [...] "The Mechanism of Nuclear Fission".|$|E
