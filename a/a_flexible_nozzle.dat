Currents and rigid nozzle plates are used inside the cartridge to fix the size of droplets exiting the chamber. This research is focused on studying the effect of nozzle flexibility on droplet formation. <b>A</b> <b>flexible</b> <b>nozzle</b> can be modeled as an flexible annular plate with a clamped outside edge. In this thesis, plate vibration equations are studied for an annular shape. An analytical solution is formed for the small deflection plate equation. To solve the large deflection plate vibration equation, Galerkin's method is used. Droplet formation is predicted by a one dimensional fluid dynamic model. An integrated plate vibration and droplet formation model is created with these basic building blocks.

40|$|In recent years, a {{wide variety}} of {{applications}} have been found for the use of pulsed jets in the area of flow control. The goal of the current study was to identify the flow field and mixing characteristics associated with an incompressible elongated jet emitted from <b>a</b> <b>flexible</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The shape of the nozzle was that of a high aspect ratio jet deforming from a fully opened to a completely closed configuration. The jet was characterized by a pulsatile flow that was self-excited by the motion of the flexible tube. The frequency of excitation was found to be between 150 and 175 Hz and the Strouhal number (nondimensional frequency) varied from 0. 17 to 0. 45. The jet flow was dominated by vortices that were shed from the nozzle with an axis parallel to the major axis. The vortices in the near field were quasi-two-dimensional so that measurements performed at the center plane represented the dynamics of the entire vortex. The nozzle excited two different modes depending on the tension applied to the flexible nozzle and the volumetric flow through it. The first was a flapping mode, which was associated with alternate shedding of vortices. This caused strong steering of the jet to one side or the other. The second mode was a symmetric mode that was associated with the formation of counter-rotating vortex pairs. Turbulence and jet spread in the measured planes were much larger in the first mode than the second one...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Droplet {{formation}} from <b>a</b> <b>flexible</b> <b>nozzle</b> plate {{driven by}} a prescribed-waveform excitation of a piezoelectric is numerically investigated using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model with the VOF method. The droplet generator with <b>a</b> <b>flexible</b> <b>nozzle</b> plate, which is free to vibrate due to the pressure acting on the plate, is modeled in a computational domain. The CFD analysis includes the fluid-structure interaction between fluid and a flexible plate using large deflection theory. The problem {{is characterized by the}} nondimensional variables based on the capillary parameters of time, velocity, and pressure. The CFD model is validated with experiment results. This study examines the characteristics of the applied waveforms and nozzle plate material properties to change the vibrational characteristics of the nozzle plate. The effect of fluid properties on the droplet formation process is also investigated focusing on surface tension and viscous forces. The mechanism of the droplet formation excited by a drop-on-demand piezoelectric waveform is investigated using a step-function and a pulse waveform. The piezoelectric displacement {{plays an important role in}} generating either forward-driven momentum or a suction pressure inside the chamber. For the step-function waveform, the nondimensional applied impulse is defined and used to characterize the post-breakoff droplet volume. Increasing the impulse of the piezoelectric can be used to cause a faster droplet velocity and it is shown that the vibration of the nozzle plate has a strong effect on the droplet velocity, shape, and volume. Surface tension has strong influence on the droplet formation characteristics which is in contrast to a viscous force that makes little difference on the droplet formation for a range of viscosities studied. For the combination of a fluid with high surface tension and the most flexible nozzle plate, this system can cause the droplet not to be ejected from the nozzle. Successive droplet impingement onto a solid surface is numerically investigated using a CFD multiphase flow model (VOF method). The main focus of this study is to better understand the hydrodynamics of the non-splash impingement process, particularly the effect of a dynamic contact angle and fluid properties along with the interaction between successive droplets while they are impinging onto a solid surface. The pre-impact droplet conditions are prescribed based on a spherical droplet diameter, velocity, and inter-droplet spacing. The molecular kinetic theory is used to model the dynamic contact angle as a function of a contact line velocity. The numerical scheme is validated against experiment al results. In the impact spreading and receding processes, results are analyzed to determine the nondimensional deformation characteristics of both single and successive droplet impingements with the variation of fluid properties such as surface tension and dynamic viscosity. These characteristics include spreading ratio, spreading velocity, and a dynamic contact angle. The inclusion of a dynamic contact angle is shown to have a major effect on droplet spreading. In successive droplet impingement, the second drop causes a surge of spreading velocity and contact angle with an associate complex recirculating flow near the contact line after it initially impacts the preceding droplet when it is in an advancing condition. This interaction is less dramatic when the first drop is receding or stationary. The surface tension has the most effect on the maximum spreading radius in both single and successive droplet impingements. In contrast to this, the viscosity directly affects the damping of the spreading-receding process...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 The droplet {{formation}} {{process in}} the vicinity of the nozzle exit and the behavior of a spreading droplet during impingement on a smooth glass surface were studied. Two nozzle geometries were tested. The first case was a stiff stainless steel nozzle plate 0. 787 mm thick. The second case was <b>a</b> <b>flexible</b> stainless steel <b>nozzle</b> plate 0. 102 mm thick. In each case, two different waveforms were used to drive the piezoelectric element in the droplet generator. This resulted in different meniscus behavior at the nozzle exit in each case. Leading and trailing edge velocities and the position of the leading edge relative to the nozzle were measured through use of double-frame images taken with a high-speed camera to describe the formation process at the nozzle. This data was displayed in both dimensional and non-dimensional form using capillary parameters. At the impingement surface, the high speed camera was used to record the spread rate and contact angle of the droplets. This research concluded that the <b>flexible</b> <b>nozzle</b> had <b>a</b> significant impact on droplet formation. Exit velocities were more than double those of the stiff nozzle, and break-off times were shorter for the <b>flexible</b> <b>nozzle.</b> One drawback of the <b>flexible</b> <b>nozzle</b> was that satellite droplets were produced along with the main droplet, which did not happen with a stiff nozzle. Behavior at the impingement surface was also noted to be different in each case. However, this is not directly related to the different nozzles themselves, but rather the fact that the nozzles resulted in different droplet velocities. The spread rate of the droplets was observed to increase as the impingement velocity was increased. The dynamic contact angles were also measured and compared to existing models found in the literature. Although there were discrepancies, it is likely that these are due to the difference in Weber numbers between this experiment and the models...|$|R
