25|$|After her {{departure}} from The Lucy Show, Vance appeared occasionally alongside Ball on reunion shows and made several guest appearances on Ball's third sitcom, Here's Lucy (1968–1974). In 1973, {{she was diagnosed}} with breast cancer. The following year, she and her husband moved to Belvedere, California, so she could be near her sister. It was during this period that Vance's agent got her an endorsement deal with Maxwell House Coffee. Over the next several years, she could be seen in numerous commercials for Maxwell House. Vance made a number of TV guest appearances in the 1970s, including a well-remembered 1975 episode of Rhoda, as well as appearing in a number of made-for-TV movies including The Front Page (1970), Getting <b>Away</b> <b>From</b> <b>it</b> <b>All</b> (1972), and The Great Houdini (1976). She and Ball appeared together one last time in the 1977 CBS special Lucy Calls the President.|$|E
2500|$|For the {{original}} British and Australian releases, a spoof travelogue narrated by John Cleese, <b>Away</b> <b>From</b> <b>It</b> <b>All,</b> was shown before the film itself.

For instance, {{a shot of}} Bulgarian girls in ceremonial dresses was accompanied by the comment [...] "Hard to believe, isn't it, that these simple happy folk are dedicated {{to the destruction of}} Western Civilisation as we know it!", Communist Bulgaria {{being a member of the}} Warsaw Pact at the time. Not only was this a spoof of travelogues per se, it was a protest against the then common practice in Britain of showing cheaply made banal short features before a main feature.|$|E

2500|$|Speaking {{about the}} album with the Chicago Sun-Times, Fiasco has stated: [...] "Lasers {{is a great}} album. I'm {{actually}} happy with the record. I feel I got to say what I wanted even with -- It doesn't make up for {{what it took to}} get through it. It's still being argued and debated upon. ... The climate of this record was very weird, in some instances surreal. I became very abstract. I had to create this commercial art that appeases the corporate side. I had to acquiesce to certain forces. Hopefully within that I snuck in some things I actually wanted to say any way I can." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, Fiasco has expressed that during the recording process of the album he has dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts: [...] "It was mentally destructive. I say it with a certain laissez-faire now because I'm past it [...] I was super-depressed, lightly suicidal, at moments medium suicidal – and if not suicidal, willing to just walk <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> completely." ...|$|E

50|$|Most Pokémon {{use their}} Abilities in battle. Abilities can {{strengthen}} a Pokémon's own statistics or weaken a foe, inflict status effects such as paralysis or poisoning, or perform {{one of many}} other effects. For instance, a Bulbasaur uses its Overgrow Ability to power up its Grass-Type attacks when it has low HP, and when Arbok is sent into battle, it will use its Intimidate Ability to lower the opposing Pokémon's Attack statistic. Other Abilities render some Pokémon impervious to certain Types of attacks, such as the Levitate Ability rendering a Pokémon like Carnivine immune to Ground-Type attacks. Some Abilities also grant immunities or resistances, such as Lapras' Water Absorb restoring its own HP when hit by Water-Type attacks or Arcanine's Flash Fire negating Fire-Type attacks and boosting the power of its own attacks once hit. A Pokémon with the Lightning Rod Ability, such as Marowak, will keep its partner safe from Electric-Type attacks in a double battle by drawing the electricity <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>it.</b> Not <b>all</b> Abilities are helpful and may be implemented to hinder a Pokémon. For example, Slaking, which would otherwise be extraordinarily powerful, has the Truant Ability, which only allows it to attack every other turn.|$|R

5000|$|The key to {{discovering}} the Interplanetary Transport Network was {{the investigation of}} the exact nature of the winding paths near the Earth-Sun and Earth-Moon Lagrange points. They were first investigated by Jules-Henri Poincaré in the 1890s. He noticed that the paths leading to and from any of those points would almost always settle, for a time, on an orbit about that point. There are in fact an infinite number of paths taking one to the point and <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>it,</b> and <b>all</b> of which require no change in energy to reach. When plotted, they form a tube with the orbit about the Lagrange point at one end. The derivation of these paths traces back to mathematicians Charles C. Conley and Richard P. McGehee. [...] Hiten, Japan's first lunar probe, was moved into lunar orbit using similar insight into the nature of paths between the Earth and the Moon. Beginning in 1997, Martin Lo, Shane D. Ross, and others wrote a series of papers identifying the mathematical basis that applied the technique to the Genesis solar wind sample return, and to Lunar and Jovian missions. They referred to it as an Interplanetary Superhighway (IPS) ...|$|R

This paper presents a data set collected regarding attitudes towards autonomous {{data collection and analysis}} in the planetary science community and initial analysis of this data. A survey, conducted at the 2013 Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, asked respondents to identify whether or not they would accept conclusions drawn by autonomous data collection techniques and what factors would impact this acceptance.
