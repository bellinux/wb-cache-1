Foreign aid as an instrument of foreign policy is a fundamental question for bilateral aid donors. However, {{because of the lack of}} complete data, the study of the People's Republic of China's foreign aid policy has encountered many difficulties. Nevertheless, this study has been able to show the connection between Peking's foreign policy and its foreign aid policy. This study collects and analyzes Peking's foreign aid data from 1953 to 1989 in order to investigate Peking's foreign aid policy. In the internal dimension, it attempts to discover the relationships between the PRC's annual amount of aid commitment and its domestic political and economic development. In the external dimension, it assumes that there is a positive correlation between Peking's foreign aid and its foreign policy. A qualitative analysis is used to discuss the internal determinants of the PRC's annual <b>aid</b> <b>amount.</b> Two explanatory variables, political conflict and economic development, are examined. A regression analysis is adopted to investigate the external determinants of the PRC's selection of aid recipients and of Peking's <b>aid</b> <b>amount</b> to individual aid recipients, with the examination of twelve and twenty explanatory variables, respectively. The research findings show that the PRC's annual aid commitment is influenced by domestic political conflict before 1976, and by domestic economic policies after 1976. The findings also indicate that Peking's foreign aid distribution is a useful indicator of foreign policy. The PRC's foreign aid policy is based mainly upon its motivation in pursuit of foreign policy goals. The change of foreign policy goals in four different periods had an impact on Peking's selection of its aid recipients and on its geographical aid distribution...|$|E

A total of 69 second graders were administered a revised verion of Furman and Buhrmester's (1985) Network of Relationships Inventory.

Findings indicated that the most consistent predictors of social competence were companionship and instrumental <b>aid.</b> <b>Amount</b> of time spent with mother was negatively relatel to indices of social competence. For boys, companionship with mother was predictive of disruptiveness. In contrast, aid from mother was positively related to indices of social competence.

40|$|In {{the last}} 50 years aid has {{extrapolated}} its diplomatic objective. The {{total amount of}} aid flows disbursed by developed countries has summed lots of billion of dollars. The expectations, were, {{for a long period}} of time, not even measured or quantified. The buzz and the media circus created around aid have made African children a trademark used to gather millions. But in the middle of such buzz, the potential effectiveness of these large disbursements was not regarded. The tremendous flow of money has created regional elites, feeding their bank account from the total lack of responsibility that some aid agencies strongly practice. The track record for failed countries is, still today, incredible high, considered the amount of money and resources disbursed. How well is aid working in terms of economic growth and human development? What is the current development picture of the poorest of the poorest? The aim of this dissertation is clear: ascertain the impact of the world’s social investment, measured through its return in development and growth. How positive is world’s current ROSI (return on social investment) ? We will therefore, review the main authors on effectiveness of aid and how do they engage with the current efforts in monitoring and control aid. We will give a special focus on human developing index, as a measure of both poverty and as the main guideline regarding development by crossing net official development assistance (1960 [...] ‐ 2010) with three different proxies (GDP per capita, Infant mortality rate and School enrolment), representative of each one of HDI’s levels (Income, Education and Health). We found no significant impact of the total flow of ODA given to a specific country, and its economic growth or human development. Subsequently we have disaggregated the aid flow, narrowing its purpose and increasing its explicative power by filtering ODA according to the sector where it was used (ODA used in Production, ODA used in Education and ODA used in Health), and then crossing it again with the three development proxies referred above. None significant correlation was found, although health sector stood out as the sector more susceptible to ODA inflows. The evidences collected over the resolution of this exercise led to the construction of an operational framework, prepared to analyse and structure aid disbursement based on its potential effectiveness. This framework will operate upon aid’s end [...] ‐to [...] ‐end flow by analysing all the resources and constrains experienced during the process. The guiding axes will the amount of aid, the context where aid is disbursed,, the conditions and resources behind its disbursement and finally the results achieved within this constrains. The extremely poor data availability has defined a constrained economic exercise; nonetheless we were able to find no significant relation between the inflow of a specific <b>aid</b> <b>amount</b> and the associated proxy capable of measuring that flow’s potential.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the integrated case study for Tanzania carried out under an OECD project on Development and Climate Change. The report is structured around a three-tiered framework. First, recent climate trends {{and climate change}} scenarios for Tanzania are assessed, and key sectoral impacts are identified and ranked along multiple indicators to establish priorities for adaptation. Second, donor portfolios in Tanzania are analyzed to examine the proportion of donor activities affected by climate risks. A desk analysis of donor strategies and project documents as well as national plans is conducted to assess the degree of attention to climate change concerns in development planning and assistance. Third, an indepth analysis is conducted for climate change impacts and response strategies for Mount Kilimanjaro – a critical ecosystem, biodiversity hotspot, and source of freshwater. This part of the analysis draws upon extended field research by a case study consultant in collaboration with national and international partners. Analysis of recent climate trends reveals that climate change poses significant risks for Tanzania. While projected changes in precipitation are uncertain, {{there is a high}} likelihood of temperature increases as well as sea level rise. Climate change scenarios across multiple general circulation models show increases in country averaged mean temperatures of 1. 3 °C and 2. 2 °C projected by 2050 and 2100, which are broadly consistent, though lower than, projections used in Tanzania’s Initial National Communication. The sectors potentially impacted by climate change include agriculture, forests, water resources, coastal resources, human health, as well as energy, industry and transport. While uncertainties in climate change and impact projections pose a challenge for anticipatory adaptation in any country, Tanzania’s case has several specific characteristics that might suggest the need for a differentiated adaptation strategy. First, the climate change projections which form the basis of national assessments rely on an older generation of climate models which project higher temperature increases than more recent models analyzed in the present study. Updating of climate scenarios and impact projections through the use of multiple and more recent models might therefore be advisable prior to the formulation of aggressive (and potentially expensive) adaptation responses. A second characteristic feature of Tanzania is that certain sectors such as agriculture and water resources are projected to experience both negative and positive impacts under climate change – for example, while production of maize is projected to decline, the production of two cash crops (coffee and cotton) is projected to increase. The implication for adaptation therefore may be to not only cushion adverse impacts, but also to harness positive opportunities. A third key characteristic is that unlike most other countries where the need for adaptation relies on projections of future impacts, some discernible trends in climate and attendant impacts are already underway in Tanzania. Such impacts – as is the case of the Kilimanjaro ecosystem - argue for more immediate adaptation responses as opposed to a “wait and see” strategy. Tanzania receives close to a billion US dollars of Official Development Assistance (ODA) annually. Analysis of donor portfolios in Tanzania using the OECD-World Bank Creditor Reporting System (CRS) database reveals that between 12 - 25 % of development assistance (by <b>aid</b> <b>amount)</b> or 20 - 30 % of donor projects (by number) are in sectors potentially affected by climate risks. However, these numbers are only indicative at best, given that any classification based on sectors suffers from oversimplification the reader is referred to the main report for a more nuanced interpretation. Donor and government documents generally do not mention climate change explicitly, although frequent references are made to the impacts of climate variability and their linkages to economic performance. There is COM/ENV/EPOC/DCD/DAC(2003) 5 /FINAL 7 however considerable synergy between priorities of at least some national plans and measures that might be required for climate change adaptation, such as water conservation, improving agricultural resilience, and forest conservation. However, some of these goals (such as water conservation) had been articulated, though not successfully implemented in previous plans. Therefore, a key obstacle facing “mainstreaming” is not synergies at the level of planning documents, but rather the successful implementation of such plans. The in-depth sector analysis focuses on the climate change impacts and policy responses on the Mount Kilimanjaro ecosystem. Glaciers on Mount Kilimanjaro have been in a general state of retreat on account of natural causes for over a hundred and fifty years. Due to a decline in precipitation coupled with a local warming trend that has been recorded {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century Kilimanjaro’s ice cap is now projected to vanish entirely by as early as 2020. The symbolism of this loss is indeed significant, and furthermore the loss of the ice cap would also imply that valuable records of past climates contained in its ice cores would also be irreplaceably destroyed. From a physical and socio economic perspective however, this analysis concludes that the impact of the loss of the ice cap is likely to be very limited. Much more significant is the enhancement in the intensity and risk of forest fires on Mount Kilimanjaro as a consequence of the increase in temperatures and a concomitant decline in precipitation over the past several decades. Forest fires have resulted in the replacement of the fog intercepting subalpine forest belt by low lying shrub which has already seriously impacted the hydrological balance of the mountain as fog intercepting cloud forests play a key role in the water budgets of high altitude drainage basins. A continuation of current trends in climatic changes, fire frequency, and human influence could result in the loss of most of the remaining subalpine Erica forests in a matter of years. With this, Mount Kilimanjaro will have lost its most effective water catchment. Among the more immediate adaptation responses identified by this report are institutional measures such as the inclusion of the forest belt into the Kilimanjaro National Park and the creation of a paramilitary ranger group to deter logging, as well as better investments in early warning systems, particularly the purchase of one or two aircraft for aerial surveillance. There is also a need to limit cross-border migration of big game from neighbouring Amboseli, which is adding to the stress on the Kilimanjaro ecosystem. In addition to short term solutions there is acritical need to develop a comprehensive and holistic development plan focusing on fire-risk and forest destruction, livelihood needs of the local population as well as on conservation strategies to ensure the long term sustainability of the valuable resources of the Kilimanjaro ecosystem.
