5|$|The main trade route {{leading into}} Han China passed first through Kashgar, yet Hellenized Bactria further west {{was the central}} node of {{international}} trade. By the 1st century AD, Bactria and much of Central Asia and North India were controlled by the Kushan Empire. Silk was the main export item from China to India. Indian merchants brought various goods to China, including tortoise shell, gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, tin, fine cloth, woolen textiles, perfume and incense, crystal sugar, pepper, ginger, salt, coral, pearls, glass items, and Roman wares. Indian merchants brought Roman styrax and frankincense to China, while the Chinese knew bdellium as a fragrant item from Persia, although it was native to West India. The tall Ferghana horses imported from Fergana were highly prized in Han China. The newly introduced exotic Central Asian grapes (i.e. vitis vinifera) were used to make grape wine, although the Chinese had rice wine before this. Glass luxury items from ancient Mesopotamia {{have been found in}} Chinese tombs and dated to the late Spring and Autumn period (771–476 BC). Roman glasswares have been found in Chinese tombs dating to the early 1st century BC, with the earliest specimen found at the southern Chinese seaport of Guangzhou. Silverwares from Roman- and Arsacid territories have also been found <b>at</b> <b>Han</b> tomb sites.|$|E

25|$|The Chatalar Inscription, a Bulgarian {{epigraph}} {{written on}} a column in medieval Greek, was unearthed in 1905 {{in the village of}} Han Krum (then known as Chatalar). The inscription's text indicates that kanasybigi Omurtag built an aulē with four columns topped by two lion sculptures near the Ticha River. Earlier scholars linked that passage with Preslav, the city that would succeed Omurtag's capital Pliska as the ruling centre of the Bulgarian Empire in the end of the 9th century. In modern times, however, Omurtag's aulē has been conclusively proven to be the site <b>at</b> <b>Han</b> Krum, which is much closer to where the epigraph was excavated. While it remains unclear whether the word aulē should be interpreted as the Greek αύλή ("palace, court") or the steppe nomadic aul, a fortified ruling centre, the ruins <b>at</b> <b>Han</b> Krum suitably match the medieval description.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{research}} has {{established that the}} medieval site <b>at</b> <b>Han</b> Krum was inhabited for more than 150years, from 822 until the late 10th century, when the fort was razed. This was not the permanent end of its habitation, as new buildings were constructed {{on top of the}} ruins. Excavations of the Palace of Omurtag began in 1957, though they were never fully completed. Since 2000, the site has been extensively excavated by Bulgarian and German archaeologists.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 Tibetan unrest, {{also known}} as 3•14 Riots , {{was a series of}} riots, protests, and demonstrations that started in Tibetan {{regional}} capital of Lhasa and spread to other Tibetan areas and a number of monasteries including outside the Tibet Autonomous Region, which led to 18 civilians killed and 382 injured. What originally began as an annual observance of Tibetan Uprising Day resulted in street protests by monks, that later descended into rioting, burning, looting, and ethnic killing by March 14. The violence was mostly directed <b>at</b> <b>Han</b> and Hui civilians by Tibetans participating in the unrest. Police intervened to prevent the conflict from further escalation. At the same time but also in response, protests mostly supporting the Tibetans erupted in cities in North America and Europe. 18 Chinese embassies and consulates were attacked.|$|E

500|$|Reaction {{to the new}} cuts was mixed, with {{commentators}} criticising unnecessary additions such as a computer-generated Jabba the Hutt in {{the first}} film and a new musical number in Return of the Jedi; an alteration involving the bounty hunter Greedo shooting <b>at</b> <b>Han</b> Solo drew significant ire. Further changes to the series {{were added to the}} 2004 DVD and the 2011 Blu-ray releases – these changes also drew criticism.

2500|$|The {{main feature}} of the archaeological site is the early-9th-century Bulgarian {{fortified}} rampart with Omurtag's palace within its limits.

The inner fort had its main entrance located in the eastern part. The buildings within the enclosure are thought to have served as a noble dwelling, i.e. a palace, though it is archaeologically uncertain whether they date to Omurtag's reign or to a later period. Balabanov theorizes that the fort accommodated a garrison commander and barracks.|$|E
