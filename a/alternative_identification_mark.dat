Micropower impulse radar is used to transmit a high risetime, short duration pulse to a focussed radar target area of the substrate having the two dimensional <b>identification</b> <b>marks.</b> The method further includes the steps of listening for radar echoes returned from the <b>identification</b> <b>marks</b> during a short listening period window occurring a predetermined time after transmission of the radar pulse. If radar echoes are detected, an image processing step is carried out. If no radar echoes are detected, the method further includes sequentially transmitting further high risetime, short duration pulses, and listening for radar echoes from each of said further pulses after different elapsed times {{for each of the}} further pulses until radar echoes are detected. When radar echoes are detected, data based on the detected echoes is processed to produce an image of the <b>identification</b> <b>marks...</b>|$|R
30|$|In {{the above}} {{discussion}} regarding various <b>identification</b> <b>marks,</b> it is {{emphasized that the}} <b>identification</b> <b>marks</b> from {{the characteristics of the}} volcanic products mostly reflect the depositional environmental information of the eruption products. Of all the <b>identification</b> <b>marks</b> discussed here, only vesicles content of pyroclasts ejected from an explosive eruption {{is directly related to the}} eruption environment, which can be used as the direct evidence for identifying the eruption environment (Table 1, Table 2). Other <b>identification</b> <b>marks</b> do not directly reflect the eruption environment but the depositional environment instead. The following conditions should be matched first if the aforementioned indirect marks are also used to identify the eruption environment: (1) eruption position (the crater) is flat and very close to depositional area; (2) depositional area is located in deep water in large-scale basins and meanwhile the volcanic materials do not belong to the reworked sediments of early eruptive products. Otherwise, it is difficult to ensure that the depositional environment can reflect or represent the eruption environment.|$|R

30|$|Different {{types of}} {{volcanic}} eruptions develop various lithofacies and lithofacies associations. Therefore, not every volcanic eruption has all or {{has the same}} <b>identification</b> <b>marks.</b> The most reliable ones for identifying the explosive eruption include quenching cracks, quenching textures, vesicles abundance, large-scale cross-beddings and the underlying depositional environment; the most reliable ones for identifying the effusive eruption include pillow structures, peperites, effusive lithofacies associations (including quenching structure) and the underlying depositional environment. The common <b>identification</b> <b>marks</b> of these two eruption types consist of the underlying depositional environment (background factors), quenching structure and its products which were resulted from the encountering of hot volcanic materials into the cooler water.|$|R
