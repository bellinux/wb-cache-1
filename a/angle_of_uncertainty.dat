Here the reference is mostly to China, India, but Japan and South East Asia {{will be part of}} this scenario. This is both an understandable yet questionable objective and statement. Understandable, because global economic growth has been driven by China, India and other smaller nations. Questionable because a century can be a long time to occupy this position. Moreover China, with all of its clear market propositions is still an economy which is centrally planned and ruled by a Communist Party. In addition the economy is dominated by State Owned Enterprises (SOE) which alone creates nervousness and difficulty for many western countries. Nonetheless the US, the European Union and Australia are all vying for their place in this new vision statement and positioning which each nation wishes to see itself. Each geographic location is seeking ways to find the ability to project a positive and prosperous future. We have witnessed the release of an Australian White Paper in 2012 which identifies Australian future economic growth associated and even tied to Asian growth. The EU and the US are likewise scrambling to position themselves to not be left behind. This paper seeks to explore the way the US, the EU and Australia see this Asian century and why they have all embarked on placing themselves alongside the Asian tigers. The paper will examine the basis on which it will be the Asian century and why these geographic and global centres place their future in the hands of what still remains a region which remains with many <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and unpredictability...|$|R

30|$|The {{advantage}} of FCM algorithms need not {{to determine the}} threshold. However, there are two shortcomings for the FCM algorithm applied to the MDI. One {{is the loss of}} the original spectral information because of only the single information being used, which causes the FCM algorithm to be the worse result in the uncertainty region (around the threshold). Another problem is that the fuzzy exponent of FCM is not easily determined, which is generally acquired by try and error method or empirical knowledge. The methods make the FCM have no generality for change detection. In order to overcome the above shortcomings, we use the magnitude and spectral <b>angle</b> information <b>of</b> bitemporal image in the uncertainty region. Then, we use the D-S theory to fuse the results from the magnitude and spectral angle {{in order to reduce the}} uncertainty.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} {{an extension}} of minimum variance beamforming that explicitly takes into account variation or uncertainty in the array response. Sources <b>of</b> this <b>uncertainty</b> include imprecise knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> arrival and <b>uncertainty</b> in the array manifold. In our method, uncertainty in the array manifold is explicitly modeled via an ellipsoid that gives the possible values of the array for a particular look direction. We choose weights that minimize the total weighted power output of the array, subject to the constraint that the gain should exceed unity for all array responses in this ellipsoid. The robust weight selection process can be cast as a second-order cone program that can be solved efficiently using Lagrange multiplier techniques. If the ellipsoid reduces to a single point, the method coincides with Capon’s method. We describe in detail several methods {{that can be used}} to derive an appropriate uncertainty ellipsoid for the array response. We form separate uncertainty ellipsoids for each component in the signal path (e. g., antenna, electronics) and then determine an aggregate uncertainty ellipsoid from these. We give new results for modeling the element-wise products of ellipsoids. We demonstrate the robust beamforming and the ellipsoidal modeling methods with several numerical examples.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new non certainty-equivalent {{adaptive control system}} for the control of a missile based on the immersion-and-invariance approach. The mathematical model of the missile represents the nonlinear longitudinal dynamics, and {{it is assumed that}} all the aerodynamic parameters (except the sign of a single control input gain) are not known. The objective here is to control the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack of the missile. For the trajectory control <b>of</b> the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack, a nonlinear non-certainty-equivalent adaptive control system is designed, and Lyapunov stability theory is used for stability analysis in the closed-loop system. The autopilot has a modular structure, which consists of a control module and a parameter estimator. In this non certainty-equivalent adaptive law, each estimated parameter is the sum of a partial estimate generated by an update law and a nonlinear function. For comparison, a traditional certainty-equivalent adaptive control system is also designed. A special feature of the designed non certainty-equivalent adaptive autopilot (unlike the certainty-equivalent adaptive systems) is that whenever the estimated parameters attain their true values, they remain frozen thereafter. Furthermore, it is shown that the trajectory of the closed-loop system, including the non certainty-equivalent adaptive law, is eventually confined to a manifold in the space of missile states and estimated parameters, and the autopilot asymptotically recovers the performance of a deterministic control system. Simulation results for the non certainty-equivalent adaptive and certainty-equivalent adaptive laws are presented. These results show that the designed autopilots accomplish trajectory control <b>of</b> the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack despite <b>uncertainties</b> in the system parameters, but for properly chosen feedback and adaptation gains, the trajectory tracking performance is better with the non certainty-equivalent adaptive law...|$|R

40|$|In the {{presence}} of jamming, the task of tracking targets using adaptive phased array radars raises challenges for both signal processing and tracking algorithms. While algorithms for deep nulling of jammers, such as adaptive beamforming, are well-known, tracking algorithms still {{have to face the}} problem of the jammer notch, where targets are barely visible (for the antenna) due to jamming interference and/or adaptive jammer suppression. On top of that, tracking algorithms have to cope with inaccurate predictions and large bias of measurements, possibly leading to track instabilities culminating in track loss. This paper deals with the problem of maintaining a track for a single target in severe jamming environment. We present different stabilization measures to improve track stability and track continuity (e. g., avoidance of antenna look directions in the jammer notch, usage of pseudo-measurements to maintain the track file if the predicted target direction is in the ja mmer notch, etc.). In this context, the most accurate modeling <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> measurement <b>uncertainties</b> plays a decisive role.

Aerocapture uses aerodynamic drag instead of propulsion to decelerate from the interplanetary approach trajectory to a captured orbit {{during a single pass}} through the atmosphere. After capture, propulsion is used to move the spacecraft from the initial captured orbit to the desired science orbit. A preliminary assessment identified that a spacecraft with a lift to drag ratio of 0. 8 was required for aerocapture. Performance analyses of the 0. 8 L/D vehicle were performed using a high fidelity flight simulation within a Monte Carlo executive to determine mission success statistics. The simulation was the Program to Optimize Simulated Trajectories (POST) modified to include Neptune specific atmospheric and planet models, spacecraft aerodynamic characteristics, and interplanetary trajectory models.

The Monte Carlo analyses incorporated approach trajectory delivery errors, aerodynamic characteristics uncertainties, and atmospheric density variations.
