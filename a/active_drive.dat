50|$|The Jeep Cherokee can be {{equipped}} with three different four-wheel drive systems: <b>Active</b> <b>Drive</b> I, <b>Active</b> <b>Drive</b> II, and <b>Active</b> <b>Drive</b> Lock. All of these systems come with Jeep's Selec-Terrain traction control system and rear-axle disconnect feature. The rear axle disconnect feature, a first for Compact SUV, disconnects the rear-axle when four-wheel drive is not needed. This lowers parasitic drivetrain load; which improves fuel efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Active</b> <b>Drive</b> Low {{includes}} {{all of the}} features of <b>Active</b> <b>Drive</b> I but denotes a greater possible crawl ratio. When in [...] "4-Low" [...] mode the front and rear axles are locked together and power is sent to all four-wheels through the power transfer unit although no low range gear reduction occurs. <b>Active</b> <b>Drive</b> low relies on shorter axle gear ratios while holding first gear in the ZF9HP transmission to achieve a crawl ratio of 20:1; similar in effect to Freedom Drive II.|$|E

40|$|In the {{presented}} {{work the}} design, development and energy analysis of an <b>active</b> <b>driven</b> knee prosthesis is described. This thesis {{is part of}} the research activities "Active actuators for prostheses and orthoses" at the Fraunhofer IPA. The analysis and design of a <b>drive</b> system for <b>active</b> powered knee prostheses is discussed. The derivation of technical requirements for an active prosthesis system is carried out for an <b>active</b> <b>driven</b> knee prosthesis system. Parameters for the drive system in the <b>active</b> <b>driven</b> knee prosthesis are defined using methods from the engineering of electrical drives. So called characteristic curves for the active motion at the knee are defined. Different concepts for the kinematic solution of an active powered motion at the knee axis are presented. As solution for the powered motion a BLDC motor gearbox concept is described. Possible methods for the modeling of multidisciplinary systems are discussed using the example of an active knee prosthesis. Modeling of the active knee prosthesis using a state space model, the bondgraph methodology and the Port-Hamilton-Approach is described. The simulation of the active powered knee prosthesis is conducted using the state space model and the Port-Hamilton-Approach. Characteristic parameters of the gait cycle are checked using a special test system and are compared with the results of the simulations. At last an outlook for additional research work in the field of <b>active</b> <b>driven</b> prosthesis systems is given...|$|R

25|$|EyeSight is Subaru's {{active safety}} system that uses twin CCD cameras, {{simulating}} stereoscopic vision. It {{was first introduced}} in Japan only as <b>Active</b> <b>Driving</b> Assist (ADA) in 1999. When activated, it actively monitors the road through the windshield-mounted cameras, and can react to driving conditions and possibly avert collisions. Models equipped with EyeSight earned the highest possible rating in the IIHS front crash safety test. Unlike other manufacturers offering stereoscopic cameras for drivers-asset purposes, the Eyesight system's cameras are not bonded to the windshield. Thus, if the windshield is dirty on the inside, it may affect the system's performance.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the time}} of its launch Quilliam {{published}} a policy proposal for the British government and journalists, in which it suggested that rehabilitation centres should be established where extremists could be deradicalised. These centres would expose extremists and terrorists who wished to leave their organisations to the work of scholars whose work had been recognized as sound and legitimate.There is more recent information about Quilliam's goals available on its website. For example:Challenging extremism is the duty of all responsible members of society. Not least because cultural insularity and extremism are products of the failures of wider society to foster a shared sense of belonging and to advance liberal democratic values. With Islamist extremism in particular, we believe a more self-critical approach must be adopted by Muslims. Westophobic ideological influences and social insularity needs to be challenged within Muslim communities by Muslims themselves whilst simultaneously, an <b>active</b> <b>drive</b> towards creating an inclusive civic identity must be pursued by all members of society.Quilliam seeks to challenge what we think, and the way we think. It aims to generate creative, informed and inclusive discussions to counter the ideological underpinnings of terrorism, whilst simultaneously providing evidence-based recommendations to governments for related policy measures.To date, the organization's goals have been mainly communicated in three ways: through the publication of reports, through involvement with the media, i.e. by taking part in interviews and discussions across Europe and the Middle East, and through its [...] "Outreach and Training" [...] unit, which delivers a [...] "radicalisation awareness programme".

40|$|Self-organization often {{develops}} in thermal equilibrium as a conse-quence of entropy and potential interactions.

Examples include “random organization” of sheared colloidal suspensions (1) and rods (2), nematic order from giant number fluctuations in vibrated rods (3) and phase separation from self-induced diffusion gradients (4). Biological (5 – 7) and artificial active particles (8 – 11), also exhibit swarm patterns that result from their inter-actions (12 – 15). In order to study <b>active,</b> <b>driven,</b> collective phenomena we created a system of self-propelled particles where the propulsion can be turned on and off with a blue light.

40|$|Background: Replacement of {{wild-type}} mosquito populations with {{genetically modified}} versions is being explored {{as a potential}} strategy to control vector-borne diseases. Due to lower expected relative fitness of transgenic individuals, transgenes must be driven into populations for these scenarios to be successful. Several gene drive mechanisms exist in a theoretical sense but none are currently workable in mosquitoes. Even if strategies were workable, {{it would be very}} difficult to recall released transgenes in the event of unforeseen consequences. What is needed is a way to test transgenes in the field for feasibility, efficacy and safety prior to releasing an <b>active</b> <b>drive</b> mechanism. Methodology/Principal Findings: We outline a method, termed Multi-locus assortment (MLA), to spread transgenes into vector populations by the release of genetically-modified mosquitoes carrying multiple stable transgene inserts. Simulations indicate that [1] insects do not have to carry transgenes at more than 4 loci, [2] transgenes can be maintained at high levels by sequential small releases, the frequency of which depends on the construct fitness cost, and [3] in the case of unforeseen negative non-target effects, transgenes can be eliminated from the population by halting transgenic releases and/or mass releases of wild-type insects. We also discuss potential methods to create MLA mosquito strains in the laboratory. Conclusions/Significance: While not as efficient as <b>active</b> <b>drive</b> mechanisms, MLA has other advantages: [1] MLA strains can be constructed for some mosquito species with currently-available technology, [2] MLA will allow the ecologica...|$|E
