40|$|While the {{importance}} of currency movements to industry competitiveness is theoretically well established, {{there is little evidence}} that currency risk impacts US industries. Applying a conditional asset pricing model to 36 US industries, we find that all industries have a significant currency premium that adds about 2. 47 percentage points to the cost of equity and accounts for approximately 11. 7 % of total risk premium in absolute value. Cross-industry variation in the currency premium is explained by foreign income, industry competitiveness, leverage, liquidity, and other industry characteristics, while its time variation is explained by US <b>aggregate</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>trade,</b> monetary policy, growth opportunities, and other macro variables.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the IMF approach to macroeconomic adjustment in Egypt with, firstly, an empirical {{assessment of the}} analytical foundations of this approach and, secondly, the construction and estimation of a small macroeconomic model of the Egyptian economy over the period 1952 - 86. Following an overall appraisal of Egyptian macroeconomic performance, with and without the application of Fund financial-supported adjustment programmes (conditionality), {{the main part of}} the thesis provides empirical evidence on the determinants of <b>aggregate</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>trade,</b> money supply and money demand and inflation. Examination of determinants of foreign trade shows that demand for exports is price-elastic, while demand for imports is income-elastic. However, it appears that Egypt's export supply is constrained by capacity. Consequently, devaluation may not play a substantial role towards improving the trade account. Study of the monetary sector reveals that the money supply is best regarded as endogenous, contrary to the assumption made in the Fund approach. Assuming an endogenous money supply, both stock adjustment-expectations and error correction models of money demand behaviour reveal a well-fitting function. The IMF view of inflation in LDCs is that it is essentially a monetary phenomenon, i. e. caused by an excess supply of money. Evidence is provided to show that, in addition to money supply growth, structural bottlenecks and expectations are also influential in the inflation process in Egypt and the basic IMF view of inflation should be modified accordingly. Finally, in order to explain changes in income, prices and balance of payments in Egypt, a small aggregate macroeconomic model is constructed and estimated. Unlike the conventional IMF model, real output is not taken to be predetermined. Estimates of the structural parameters as well as model simulations suggest that the model performs well in tracking the historical values of the dependent variables...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} whether uniform tariffs {{give rise}} to the highest welfare compared with tariffs that either escalate or de-escalate along the value chain of production. We show that countries may {{be better off with}} de-escalating tariffs where tariff rates are higher on intermediate inputs and lower on final goods. The key point is that higher tariffs can encourage agglomeration of intermediate input suppliers and final goods producers in one country. With high tariffs on intermediate inputs, the benefits of close proximity to final goods producers may outweigh the benefits of locating according to comparative advantage, which is more likely when the share of intermediate inputs in producing final goods is high. De-escalating tariffs yield the highest welfare when the benefits of agglomeration are very high. These benefits of agglomeration accrue to both countries in the form of lower prices.

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is an {{analysis}} of the state monopoly of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> in a socialist economy. In first part of the article there is discussed an approach, lasting till now, to an essence and conception of socialist <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> monopoly. Until recently in economic literature prevailed the opinion that seems {{to be based on the}} assumption that a centralized <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> system is the only one possible solution, when the <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> is taken over by the state. The monopoly of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> and its monopolistic organization form were then identified as being one and the same. Nevertheless such a position may lead to various misapprehensions. For these reasons rejecting identification of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> monopoly with the far centralization of decisions in external trade the author makes a distinction between a monopolistic organizational structure of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> and the category of the monopoly in <b>foreign</b> <b>trade.</b> On the basis of this distinction an attempt is made to define term of the state monopoly of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> as a situation in which a right to realization <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> turnovers has not only the central economic authority, but all socialising sphere of national economy. Under such conditions break a principle of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> monopoly can be follow when leading external trade activités by private enterprises and persons will be admited. In this way understood the concept of the monopoly of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> creates generally conditions of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> monopoly for rational activités on external trade field. In the result within the framework of the state monopoly of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> can be apply a different types of mechanizmus, a different methods of organizations of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> turnovers, then to realize the different forms of this model. In the second part of this article it was shown an attempt of description of the most characteristic of the features of the state monopoly of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade.</b> These features can be derived from the general assumptions of the socialist economy, although different solutions for the <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> are possible. The features should define every <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> model in a socialist economy. They are as follows: 1. necessity of subordination of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade,</b> first of all to the realization of the physical proportions of the national economic plan, 2. need of control and regulation by the state all of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> turnovers, 3. leading dual form of economic calculation in foreign trade: macroeconomic calculus on central level and microeconomic calculus in enterprises.
