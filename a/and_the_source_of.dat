5|$|As the Word, Jesus was {{eternally}} {{present with}} God, active in all creation, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> humanity's {{moral and spiritual}} nature. Jesus is not only greater than any past human prophet but greater than any prophet could be. He not only speaks God's Word; he is God's Word. In the Gospel of John, Jesus reveals his divine role publicly. Here he is the Bread of Life, the Light of the World, the True Vine and more.|$|E

5|$|Water {{was taken}} at first {{from the town}} well {{opposite}} St Giles Church, but the excessive demand diminished the supply and spoiled its quality. The tunnellers' water was then pumped from a site near the Dyneley Arms crossroads. At {{the same time the}} tunnel was draining away the local farmers' natural water supply <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> Bramhope town well. Litigation on this subject continued for some years. To mitigate the situation, a public waterworks scheme with a reservoir and an aqueduct was proposed but not implemented.|$|E
5|$|For his {{services}} during the war, he was welcomed back to America {{with a large}} parade down Broadway in New York, along with other honors. Schwarzkopf led a highly publicized homecoming parade in Washington, D.C., on June 8, 1991, where he was greeted by Bush amid thousands of onlookers. His accomplishments were praised in a manner much differently from commanders who returned from the Vietnam and Korean Wars. He became an instant national celebrity <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> great curiosity by the general public. He was quick to award praise and medals to the troops, {{part of what he}} saw as restoring pride in the U.S. armed forces after the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|His {{popularity}} among the citizenry had never waned, and support {{continued to be}} evident, even {{on the eve of}} his overthrow and throughout his exile. He was seen as a hero, a model citizen, a caring monarch, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> national unity and well-being. Following his death, political wrangling prevented the return of his remains to Brazil. Continued efforts to repatriate the bodies of the Emperor and his wife dragged on for decades. The disputes were resolved and this was finally accomplished in 1920 with much fanfare. Over the decades, PedroII gradually grew within Brazil to represent the archetypical benevolent, self-effacing and effective ruler concerned only for the national welfare.|$|E

5|$|The jacket {{prescribed}} for infantry use {{was of the}} same design for all service men. The design itself depended entirely on the region, time, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> fabrics. The Eastern Theater uniform jacket was the Richmond Depot design, with three primary types issued throughout the war. The jacket varied from a cadet gray, piped and trimmed jacket, looking much like a pre-war militia jacket, to the jeans-cloth jacket that was worn out in six months. The materials and uniforms imported from England were also issued to the troops through this facility. The Western and Deep Southern facilities manufactured similar uniforms, being jeans-cloth, dyed with vegetable based grays, that would fade to brown or tan. The typical jackets issued had 5-7 button fronts, with collar and cuff trim that varied from era, region and source, and an outside pocket on occasion.|$|E
