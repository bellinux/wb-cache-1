25|$|However, the {{architecture}} {{had to be}} adapted to suit the extremes of the Mediterranean and desert climate. White and light colors reflected the heat.

Long narrow balconies, each shaded by the balcony above it, allowed residents to catch the breeze blowing in from the sea to the west. Slanted roofs were replaced with flat ones, providing a common area where residents could socialize in the cool of the evening.|$|E

25|$|Modern window {{units with}} IG {{typically}} completely replace the older double-hung unit, and include other improvements such as better sealing between {{the upper and}} lower windows, and spring-operated weight balancing that removes the need for large hanging weights inside the wall next to the windows, allowing for more insulation around the window and reducing air leakage, provides robust protection <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> and will keep the house cool in the hot summer and warm in winter. These spring-operated balancing mechanisms also typically permit the top of the windows to swing inward, permitting cleaning of the exterior of the IG window from inside the building.|$|E
25|$|The Bears resumed conference play at home <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> Devils {{following}} a week off.

Cal took an early lead with a field goal {{in the first quarter}} followed by a touchdown pass from Longshore to LaReylle Cunningham that resulted from a fumble on the Sun Devils' first possession. Longshore threw an interception in the closing minutes of the first quarter, but the Sun Devils were unable to capitalize on it. The Bears struck again in the second quarter with a 22-yard touchdown pass to Cameron Morrah, to which the Sun Devils responded to with a 30-yard touchdown pass from Rudy Carpenter to Kyle Williams.|$|E
25|$|In Livy's {{history of}} Rome, the first Etruscan king of Rome built raised, wooden {{perimeter}} seating at the Circus for Rome's highest echelons (the equites and patricians), probably midway along the Palatine straight, with an awning <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> and rain. His grandson, Tarquinius Superbus, added the first seating for citizen-commoners (plebs, or plebeians), either adjacent {{or on the}} opposite, Aventine side of the track. Otherwise, the Circus was probably still {{little more than a}} trackway through surrounding farmland. By this time, it may have been drained but the wooden stands and seats would have frequently rotted and been rebuilt. The turning posts (metae), each made of three conical stone pillars, may have been the earliest permanent Circus structures; an open drainage canal between the posts would have served as a dividing barrier.|$|E

After accepting undisclosed damages from a libel case <b>against</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> newspaper in 2008, Ronaldo donated the damages to a charity in Madeira. In 2009, Ronaldo donated £100,000 to the hospital that saved his mother's life in Madeira following her battle with cancer, so that they could build a cancer centre on the island. In support of the victims of the 2010 Madeira flood, Ronaldo pledged to play in a charity match in Madeira between Primeira Liga club Porto and players from Madeiran-based clubs Marítimo and Nacional.|$|E
25|$|Africans {{captured}} {{as slaves}} {{no longer had}} the sort of resources to practice hair grooming that they had had when home. Slaves adapted as best they could under the circumstances, finding sheep-fleece carding tools particularly useful for detangling their hair. They suffered from scalp diseases and infestations due to their deplorable living conditions. Slaves used varying remedies for disinfecting and cleansing their scalps, such as applying kerosene or cornmeal directly on the scalp with a cloth as they carefully parted the hair. For field work, male slaves shaved their hair and wore hats to protect their scalps <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun.</b> House slaves had to appear tidy and well-groomed. The men sometimes wore wigs mimicking their masters', or similar hairstyles, while the women typically plaited or braided their hair. During the 19th century, hair styling, especially among women, became more popular. Cooking grease such as lard, butter and goose grease, were used to moisturize the hair. Female slaves sometimes used hot butterknives to curl their hair.|$|E
25|$|Despite making {{essential}} {{acquisitions and}} creating depth in the roster, the Sun was projected to finish towards {{the bottom of}} the Eastern Conference standings. On May 24, 2003, the Sun hosted the first regular-season game of its inaugural season, which was shown on ABC, the league's new broadcast partner. The Sun yielded to the two-time defending champion Sparks before a sellout crowd of 9,341. At the conclusion of the 2003 season, the Sun surprised spectators by finishing with an 18–16 record, clinching the first playoff berth since the franchise relocated. The Sun swept the second-seeded Sting {{in the first round of}} the playoffs, and was slated to face Detroit in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Shock was victorious in all four games <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> in the regular season, which would be indicative of the outcome. The Sun would succumb to the eventual league champion Detroit in two enduring games. The 2003 playoffs would be the first of numerous postseason encounters that Connecticut and Detroit would share prior to the Shock's relocation to Tulsa, Oklahoma.|$|E

25|$|Malevich {{exhibited}} {{his first}} Black Square, {{now at the}} Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, at the Last Futurist Exhibition 0,10 in Petrograd in 1915. A black square placed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> appeared {{for the first time}} in the 1913 scenery designs for the Futurist opera Victory over the Sun. The second Black Square was painted around 1923. Some believe that the third Black Square (also at the Tretyakov Gallery) was painted in 1929 for Malevich's solo exhibition, because of the poor condition of the 1915 square. One more Black Square, the smallest and probably the last, may have been intended as a diptych together with the Red Square (though of smaller size) for the exhibition Artists of the RSFSR: 15 Years, held in Leningrad (1932). The two squares, Black and Red, were the centerpiece of the show. This last square, despite the author's note 1913 on the reverse, is believed to have been created in the late twenties or early thirties, for there are no earlier mentions of it.|$|E

500|$|Legend {{also has}} it that Marko {{acquired}} his strength after he was suckled by a vila. King Vukašin threw him into a river {{because he did not}} resemble him, but the boy was saved by a cowherd (who adopted him, and a vila suckled him). In other accounts, Marko was a shepherd (or cowherd) who found a vilas children lost in a mountain and shaded them <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> (or gave them water). As a reward the vila suckled him three times, and he could lift and throw a large boulder. An Istrian [...] version has Marko making a shade for two snakes, instead of the children. In a Bulgarian version, each of the three draughts of milk he suckled from the vilas breast became a snake.|$|E
