40|$|China's {{two main}} {{economic}} problems before reform were low incentives to {{workers and the}} misallocation of resources among sectors. These problems were theresult of a development strategy oriented toward heavy industry. By improving material incentives, China's reforms created a flow of new resources and allowed them to be allocated to sectors suppressed under pre-reform strategies. The onset of reform in China {{was not allowed to}} disrupt production from existing resources. Instead, the newly created resources were permitted to accrue and to flow into the more productive, often light industrial sectors, thus stimulating continuous growth of the national economy during reform. Low incentives and the suppression of nonpriority sectors are common features of the legacy of economies in transition from central planning that based their development on the rapid growth of heavy industry. China's approach may be of interest to them. Among lessons China learned are that: (a) Autonomy must be granted to micromanagement units and preserved to improve the incentive structure and create a new flow of resources. (b) While maintaining essential minimum levels of production in the pre-reform priority sectors, <b>autonomous</b> <b>enterprises</b> must be permitted and encouraged to allocate new incremental resource flows to the previously suppressed sectors.

To be sure, it is now generally agreed that the modern category of ‘science’ did not exist in the early modern period. At the same time, this period witnessed a very important stage in the process from which modern science eventually emerged. My discussion will be aimed at uncovering the new enterprise, and the new distinctions which were taking shape in the early modern period under the banner of the old Aristotelian terminology. I will argue that Leibniz begins to theorize a distinction between physics and metaphysics that tracks our distinction between the <b>autonomous</b> <b>enterprise</b> of science in its modern meaning, and the enterprise of philosophy. I will try to show that, for Leibniz, physics proper is the study of natural phenomena in mathematical and mechanical terms without recourse for its explanations to metaphysical notions. This autonomy, however, does not imply for Leibniz that physics can say on its own all that there is to be said about the natural world. Quite the opposite. Leibniz inherits from the Aristotelian tradition the view that physics needs metaphysical roots or a metaphysical grounding. For Leibniz, what is ultimately real is reached by metaphysics, not by physics. This is, in my view, Leibniz’s chief insight: the new mathematical physics is an <b>autonomous</b> <b>enterprise</b> which offers its own kind of explanations but does not exhaust what can (and should) be said about the natural world...|$|E

The Tour, he said, “is at once a myth of expres-sion and a myth of projection, realistic and utopian at the same time. ” The Tour expresses and liberates the French people through a unique fable in which the traditional impostures … mingle with forms of a positive interest, with the utopian image of the world which stubbornly seeks reconciliation by the spectacle of a total clarity of relations between man, men, and Nature. What is vitiated in the Tour is the basis, the economic motives, the ultimate profit of the ordeal, generator of ideological alibis.

The {{article was}} {{presented}} as a paper to the European Population Conference 1987, Jyväskylä, Finland, June 11 - 16, 1987 (mimeographed conference proceedings in English). A special role of employment is connected with the economic reform being introduced in the socialist countries. In the 80 's employment became a factor limiting production growth. In Poland, employment processes are affected, to a big extent, by the socio-economic crisis. New mechanisms of the national economy functioning are realized in <b>autonomous</b> <b>enterprises.</b> They concern the regulating of size and structure of employment and wage fund. The new policy has been presented in the article {{against the background of}} the analysis of labour resources. The data are for the years 1950 - 1985. The authoress points at impact of extensive factors in the post-war years and at necessity of utilizing intensive factors in the national economy, including employment. There are also discussed consequences of the decision about earlier-than-normal retirement (since 1975) and the right to child-care leaves and grants. This has resulted in substantial reserves of unutilized labour accompanied by a general labour deficit in the national economy. The article points at the necessity of introducing major changes in the employment policy with regard to the whole national economy and particular <b>autonomous</b> <b>enterprises.</b> Poland records zero growth of labour resources today. In this situation structural transformations, especially in employment, are indispensable. They may be different: horizontal, vertical, qualitative. So far successes In this sphere have been insignificant, and they do not guarantee a desirable increase of production and fuller utilization of labour resources. Further research in this field is necessary.

The centralized scheduling approach that can usually obtain good global performance but must share nearly complete information that is difficult or even impractical due to the distributed nature of real-life supply chains. This paper proposes an agent-based supply chain model to support distributed scheduling. A modified contract-net protocol (MCNP) is proposed to enable more information sharing among the enterprises than conventional CNP. Experimental simulation studies are conducted to compare and contrast the performances of the centralized [centralized heuristic (CTR) ], conventional CNP, and MNCP approaches.

40|$|Abstract | Virtual Enterprises (VEs) are {{businesses}} {{providing services}} and products {{that rely on}} the resources of multiple enterprises. VEs can achieve their business objectives only through e ective collaboration between the <b>autonomous</b> <b>enterprises</b> that comprise them. In this paper we advocate the position that e ective multi-enterprise collaboration {{can be achieved by}} integrating the business processes of the participant enterprises, and by managing the resulting multi-enterprise (business) processes. Akey requirement for this is developing multi-enterprise processes that explicitly capture and manage the functional and contractual relationships between the enterprises in a VE. In particular, this includes the inter-enterprise services each enterprise in a VE provides to others as needed to realize multi-enterprise processes. Current process management technology does not deal with the heterogeneity and autonomy oftheprocesses that need to be integrated in a multi-enterprise process.

40|$|Distributed project {{scheduling}} problem (DPSP) in supply chains {{is concerned with}} configuration and scheduling of multiple projects in a network of independent and <b>autonomous</b> <b>enterprises.</b> Individual enterprises must collaborate with each other during two main stages: the configuration of a project - selection of contractors for performing project operations and the {{project scheduling}} - determining when the operations start. However, the collaboration is especially difficult because none of these enterprises holds the global information about the entire supply chain and all constituent enterprises. Instead, they have to capitalize whatever information is shared between {{them in order to}} solve their own local problems in a distributed and autonomous fashion. It is essential for the solution process to strike an overall balance between effectiveness and efficiency.

40|$|A supply-chain project {{normally}} {{involves a}} number of independent and <b>autonomous</b> <b>enterprises</b> that share information to varying levels. The initial project schedule (preschedule) established {{at the time of}} forming the supply-chain often requires a series of amendments due to unexpected or abrupt disturbances such as temporary resource outage (e. g. machine break), arrival or cancellation of orders from customers, and change in an operation's processing time (e. g. rework). Rescheduling or adaptive scheduling is a process of updating/repairing the preschedule to adapt to the disturbances. Appropriate rescheduling methods must be chosen and applied depending on the specific protocol of sharing information agreed between the enterprises in the supply chain. This paper is concerned with the impacts of different levels of information sharing on the performance of supply-chain project rescheduling problems. Three rescheduling methods are examined in the research. They are distributed AOR (Affected Operations Rescheduling), negotiation-based rescheduling (NEG), and centralized total rescheduling (TR). These three rescheduling algorithms represent three typical information-sharing scenarios: little information sharing, limited information sharing and complete information sharing, respectively. A comprehensive computational study is conducted under different experimental settings. The results show that NEG and distAOR outperforms the TR rescheduling in terms of total cost minimization and stability of schedule and contractual relationship. NEG is superior in both rescheduling efficiency and effectiveness due to the effect of a moderate level of information sharing. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
