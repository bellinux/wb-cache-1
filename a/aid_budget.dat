25|$|To try {{and define}} climate policy as a {{trade-off}} against foreign aid {{is thus a}} forced choice that bears no relationship to reality.

40|$|Why do foreign <b>aid</b> <b>budgets</b> vary across {{countries}} and over time? Existing {{research indicates that}} {{the same set of}} factors shapes commitments toward both domestic and international redistribution. While scholars have acknowledged international normative influences on aid allocations, research on levels of donor generosity has not examined how international trade influences <b>aid</b> <b>budgets.</b> This paper examines whether imports from developing countries have a ‘displacement effect’ on aid commitments. Employing a panel of nineteen OECD donor countries, we analyze <b>aid</b> <b>budgets</b> from 1980 to 2000. We find that increased imports from developing countries to donor countries are associated with aid reductions. These results persist after controlling for international and domestic variables identified in previous research, and under other estimation techniques and model specifications.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{whether the}} absolute and relative impact of economic, political, and humanitarian variables that restrain or boost U. S. foreign assistance varies for {{different types of}} aid, from a strictly domestic decision-making framework. Using a SUR analysis for U. S. economic, military, and food aid obligations, the various <b>aid</b> <b>budgets</b> indeed behave differently {{with respect to the}} explanatory variables. GDP growth, the military budget, and Congressional orientation are more suitable predictors for economic assistance than for food or military assistance. Food aid is less likely to be correlated with the ideological orientation of the Congress and President, and is not significantly related with the military budget and GDP growth. It is, however, positively related with U. S. agricultural subsidies, and is the only variable with any significant (albeit weakly) relationship with U. S. FDI. Military assistance budgets prove to be more difficult to model in contrast to food and economic aid. Domestic poverty appears to enhance economic and food <b>aid</b> <b>budgets,</b> while restricting military assistance granted to strategic U. S. allies. In the aggregate, natural disasters, the ideological orientation of the President, and commercial interests embodied via trade-to-GDP do not appear to significantly influence any of the <b>aid</b> <b>budgets...</b>|$|R

2500|$|China's current {{relationship}} with North Korea and {{position on a}} unified Korea is seen as dependent {{on a number of}} issues. A unified Korea could prevent North Korea's nuclear weapons program from destabilizing East Asia as well as the Chinese government. The 2010 United States diplomatic cables leak mentioned two unnamed Chinese officials telling the Deputy Foreign Minister of South Korea that the younger generation of Chinese leaders increasingly believed that Korea should be reunified under South Korean rule, provided it were not hostile to China. The report also claimed that senior officials and the general public in China were becoming increasingly frustrated with the North acting like a [...] "spoiled child," [...] following its repeated missile and nuclear tests, which were seen as a gesture of defiance not only to the West, but also to China. The business magazine Caixin reported that North Korea accounted for 40% of China's foreign <b>aid</b> <b>budget</b> and required 50,000 tonnes of oil per month as a buffer state against Japan, South Korea, and the United States, with whom trade and investment is now worth billions (North Korea being seen as expensive and internationally embarrassing to support).|$|E

Aid concentration curves for monetary poverty, child malnutrition, primary school enrollments, and under-five mortality are used to assess whether aid is distributed to the poorest and most deprived countries. Major contrasts between the progressivity and regressivity of different donor&# 039;s aid programs are observed.

In contrast, the United States and European Commission spend the majority of their <b>aid</b> <b>budgets</b> in middle income countries...|$|R
