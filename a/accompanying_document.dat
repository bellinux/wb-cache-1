Later on Komorowicze (Komorowice) absorbed Byertholtowicze (Bierułtowice). In order to differentiate it from the Silesian counterpart across Biała River, which since then constituted a state border, they were dubbed as Polskie (Polish).|$|E
50|$|Politically both villages {{belonged to}} the Duchy of Opole and Racibórz and the Castellany of Oświęcim, which was in 1315 formed {{in the process of}} feudal {{fragmentation}} of Poland into the Duchy of Oświęcim, ruled by a local branch of Silesian Piast dynasty.

The village was listed in the <b>accompanying</b> <b>document</b> {{as one of the}} many villages belonging then to Dynów. Nozdrzec Palace, a local mansion of Skrzyńscy family, began probably as a fortified manor. During World War I, 15 November 1915, Nozdrzec was burned up together with the mansion by the Russian army.

500|$|The sealed dossier also {{contained}} a letter, hand-written by Kiszczak in April 1996, {{in which he}} informs the Director of the Polish Central Archives of Modern Records (...) about the <b>accompanying</b> files <b>documenting</b> the collaboration of Wałęsa with the Communist Security Service and asks him not to publish this information until five years after Wałęsa’s death.

50|$|Politically {{the village}} belonged {{initially}} to the Duchy of Cieszyn and Castellany of Oświęcim, {{which was in}} 1315 formed {{in the process of}} feudal fragmentation of Poland into the Duchy of Oświęcim, ruled by a local branch of Silesian Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia. In 1457 Jan IV of Oświęcim agreed to sell the duchy to the Polish Crown, and in the <b>accompanying</b> <b>document</b> issued on 21 February the village was mentioned as Lipnik. The territory of the Duchy of Oświęcim was eventually incorporated into Poland in 1564 and formed Silesian County of Kraków Voivodeship.|$|E
50|$|The {{settlement}} along mountainous {{part of the}} Ropičanka River was {{led from}} Smilovice tracing back to the 16th century. In 1592 the noble owners of Smilovice had a litigation with Sidonia Catherine, the ruler of the Duchy of Teschen. From the <b>accompanying</b> <b>document</b> the established of the Řeka village can be inferred to happen around 1587. In 1643 the village was mentioned as rzeka Smilowiczka, in 1647 as na Smilowskej Rzice, later on the adjective referring to Smilovice was dropped in the 19th century. It belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia {{and a part of}} the Habsburg Monarchy.|$|E
50|$|The {{border from}} the Silesian side was {{protected}} by a small gord around which a small town emerged called Jamnice/Jamnica. It could have been first mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wrocław called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 as item in Jannutha. Surely both the town and a gord were later mentioned in 1327 as Jemnicz when Casimir I, Duke of Cieszyn became a vassal of the King of Bohemia. The term oppidum used to describe it in the <b>accompanying</b> <b>document</b> was used in contrary to civitates ruling themselves under German rights of Cieszyn, Bielsko and Fryštát. It probably meant that Jemnicz was ruled under Polish (ducal) traditional rights.|$|E
