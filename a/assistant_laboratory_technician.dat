40|$|The 59 publications, {{identified}} through {{a search of}} Educational Resources Informatior Center (ERIC) publications and non-ERIC publications, were reviewed and analyzed to identify the major findings, promising developments, strategies, and methodological strengths and weaknesses which exist in curriculums designed for training dental <b>assistants,</b> dental <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians,</b> hospital attendants, nurses aides, medical and dental technicians, and practical or professional nurses. Current training programs cone closer to meeting immediate needs in some health occupational areas than in others. Of the occupational categories reviewed, only dental assistants and hospital attendants can receive training at the secondary level, while the remaining receive training at the post secondary level. Though a number of curriculums ar available, a major shortcoming is the general lack of a core or cluster curriculum. Curriculums for new and emerging occupations should be developed and evaluated through an educational planning system consisting of occupational analysis, program planning, program development and testing, and documentation and dissemination of the results. In addition, to provide and train necessary workers, improved counseling and recruitment programs and techniques will be required. (SP) - 1 "...|$|R
40|$|During dental procedures, dentists {{and their}} <b>assistants,</b> dental <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> and their <b>assistants</b> may {{be exposed to}} a wide variety of {{microorganisms}} in the blood, saliva, and oral cavity of the patients. These microorganisms may cause various air-borne and blood borne infections. The efficient infection control procedures in the dental office and the dental laboratory are not sufficiently used, mainly because these procedures cause inconveniences in dental practice. If pathogenic microorgan-isms on dental impressions and interim prostheses making devices are not decontaminated, direct trans-mission of infection can occur from patient to dentist, dental <b>laboratory</b> <b>technician</b> or vice versa. The study showed that infection can be transmitted through insufficiently decontaminated alginate and silicon impressions. A comparison was made between the two chemical structures of dental impressions material (alginate or silicon) with an objective to find out which can transmit more bacteria and which is less resistant to disinfectants. After 10 tests, three groups of impressions of both materials were sprayed with the suspension of bacteria culture Serratia rubidaea (1 ml/ 106 CFU) and taken from phantom heads. Then, the impressions of Group 1 were rinsed under running tap water, the impressions of Group 2 were immersed into METASYS Green & Clean AD disinfectant for 3 seconds, and the impressions of Group 3 were left as a control group.

40|$|Rationale. Occupational asthma is {{the most}} {{frequently}} reported diagnosis of occupational respiratory disease in developed nations. Dental and radiography professionals are potentially exposed {{to a number of}} asthmagens including acrylates, sensitizing metals, latex, cleaning products and x-ray developing solutions. Still, gaps exist in the health care worker literature in regard to risk characterization for these professions. Objectives. To evaluate the association between occupational exposures and asthma in dental and radiography professionals using a cross-sectional survey and an asthma-specific job exposure matrix. Methods. A detailed questionnaire was mailed to a random, representative sample (n= 2800) of Texas dentists, dental hygienists, dental <b>assistants,</b> dental <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> and radiographers with an active license in 2007. Self-reported occupational exposures were derived from the questionnaire and externally determined exposures from the job exposure matrix. The job exposure matrix expanded upon a previous matrix by adding new occupation and exposure categories and was coded by an expert panel. Two outcome variables were defined from the questionnaire, bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) -related symptoms, based on a previously validated 8 -item predictor, and a history of physician-diagnosed asthma occurring after entry into the healthcare profession (2 ̆ 7 reported asthma 2 ̆ 7).

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to define a simple (and easy to use) method to {{equalize}} the workload of personnel operating several small wastewater treatment plants (SWWTPs). The approach is illustrated through a case study which is the result of collaboration between researchers and a water and wastewater management company operating in Southern Italy. The topic is important since personnel {{have a significant impact on}} the operating costs of SWWTPs, and the approach outlined results in the minimum number of staff being required to assure the management of the service. Four kinds of work units are considered: plant managers, <b>assistant</b> plant managers, <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> and executives. In order to develop a practical, feasible and easy to use method, the workload was evaluated considering only the population equivalent (PE) and the number of plants managed. The core of the method is the evaluation of the percentage of time that the personnel units devote to the operation of SWWTPs of the municipality considered. The proposed procedure offers a useful tool to equalize the workload, both in terms of PE and the number of plants managed, the procedure being easily modifiable to introduce other evaluation criteria. By using familiar concepts such as PE and number of plants managed, the approach of the method can easily be understood by management. It can also be readily adapted to other similar situations...|$|R

Laboratories are the essential and fundamental part of all health systems. This study aimed to describe how <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> perceived their own self and work. This included perceived self-efficacy, perceived role, perceived equipment availability, perceived procedures, perceived reward and job, and perceived benefit of health education, as well as level of knowledge and attitudes related to work performance of <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians.</b> Methods: This was a cross-sectional quantitative study involving 120 <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> conducted in Central Java. Interviews and observation were conducted to measure performance and work-related variables. Results: Among 120 <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians,</b> 43. 3 % showed fairly good performance. They complied with 50 %– 75 % of all procedures, including sputum collection, laboratory tools utilization, sputum smearing, staining, smear examination, grading of results, and universal precaution practice. Perceived role, perceived self-efficacy, and knowledge of laboratory procedures were significantly correlated to performance, besides education and years of working as a <b>laboratory</b> <b>technician.</b> Perceived equipment availability was also significantly correlated to performance after the education variable was controlled. Conclusion: Most of the <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> believed {{that they have an}} important role in TB patients’ treatment and should display proper self-efficacy in performing laboratory activities.

50|$|The Prather {{family was}} living in Kansas City, Missouri, by 1930, where Maurice Jr.'s father found work at a local {{business}} called Greenwood's. By {{the time he was}} in his senior year of high school, Maurice Jr. had become interested in photography and had an after-school job as an <b>assistant</b> cameraman and <b>laboratory</b> <b>technician</b> at the Calvin Company in Kansas City, the largest production company for industrial films in the world. Upon turning 18 in 1944, Prather did not join the armed forces as most American young people were during those wartime days (Prather may have suffered from a physical problem which prevented him from serving in the armed forces). Instead, he found work as a photographer of wartime airplanes for North American Aviation in Kansas City. In 1945, he became an engineering photographer for Trans World Airlines (TWA), who for many years had a hub in Kansas City. Still living with his parents in Kansas City, Prather then returned to the Calvin Company as an assistant cameraman for industrial films once again. This was the longest Prather held onto a job during these early days in Kansas City---two years (1946-1948). For some reason, he decided to abandon photography altogether for a one-year stint as a schedule clerk at a Sears-Roebuck department store in Kansas City. In 1949, he decided to get a college education and so enrolled in the journalism program at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas.|$|R

In present study, WISN tool {{was used to assess}} a District Hospital in terms of staffing of <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> to understand the staffing need against the existing workload of health system. Aims: To assess the staffing needs of <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> in District Hospital using WISN method. Settings and Design: Hospital-based cross-sectional study. Materials and Methods: The present study is a cross-sectional survey involving observation, record review, and personal interview. Study was performed in a District Hospital of Madhya Pradesh. There were six <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> in the District Hospital and all of them were included in the study. The staffing pattern and need of <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> in District Hospital was estimated and WISN indicators calculated. Statistical Analysis Used: Rate ratio and proportions were calculated using Microsoft Excel 2007. Results: WISN calculation showed that District Hospital in which the study was done requires 16 <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> in order to provide the volume of health services in its annual statistics in accordance with the professional standards (activity standards) for these services, thus having a shortage of 10 <b>technicians.</b> Conclusion: The <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> in the District Hospital where study was conducted are constantly under pressure to match the existing workload due to shortage of manpower.
