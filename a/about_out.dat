In {{an interview with}} Format Magazine he said, [...] "I started making beats because I didn’t want everybody else’s sound. We wanted our own sound. So, I {{had no choice but}} to make my own beats to get that sound." [...] In an interview with Ozone Magazine, when asked about their music and the revival of the [...] "newer west" [...] movement, Ben J stated, [...] "Everything is becoming positive out here. People are growing out of that old mentality. Rapping about gangs ain’t really what it’s <b>about</b> <b>out</b> here now. Everybody is having fun."

2500|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of polling data {{of support for}} same-sex marriage in Australia and membership demographics of the SDA found that the socially conservative positions of the SDA leadership - particularly de Bruyn - {{are likely to be}} at odds with the rank-and-file of the union. The lobby group Australian Marriage Equality challenged the SDA to survey its membership before contributing further to the same-sex marriage debate in Australia. In response to a 2014 poll with 72 percent support for same-sex marriage, de Bruyn dismissed the figures but refused to poll his members on the issue. He says he [...] "knows they agree with him absolutely. When we talk to our members <b>about</b> <b>out</b> these things they agree with us". Some SDA-aligned Labor MPs do not agree with the SDA's stance on same-sex marriage and in fact support same-sex marriage in defiance of the SDA, some South Australian examples being Kate Ellis, Amanda Rishworth and Nick Champion.|$|E
2500|$|From the Reading Mercury (Mon 24 July) [...] "A {{letter from}} [...] "An old Cricket Player" [...] re the match Reading v. Sonning on Bulmarsh Heath on Fri., 21 July, {{complaining}} of the latter’s unfair tactics. Sonning batted first and made 86: Reading then made 187, sacrificing their last five wickets: Sonning then made 125 which put them 24 ahead. There {{had been a}} bet between a player on each side on their total individual scores. The Sonning player made 9 the first innings, and between 60 & 70 the second : the Reading player having made 41 the first innings could not exceed the other’s total as only 25 runs were wanted to win the match. There was a dispute over that, but finally the Reading player agreed to go in for the game. Sonning at first refused to play or to pay the money, although there was nearly an hour to go they finally went into the held, and ‘by throwing the ball <b>about,</b> <b>out</b> of the way’ so delayed the game {{that it could not}} be played out".|$|E

He took a great fancy to a queer crab-faced old man, smelling of sea-weed, who wheeled his carriage, and held long conversations with him; but Florence was the only child companion whom he ever cared to have with him, though he liked to watch other children playing in the distance.|$|E

But he knew that if he did, she would very likely fly right over where Mr. Quack was, and that wouldn't do at all. No, indeed, that wouldn't do at all. One of the hunters would be sure to see her.

And Lily took a rake, and raked for two minutes; and Mr Crosbie, making an attempt to pitch the hay into the cart, had to pay half-a-crown for his footing to the hay-makers; and Bell sat quiet under a tree, mindful of her complexion; whereupon Mr Crosbie, finding the hay-pitching not much to his taste, threw himself under the same tree also, quite after the manner of Apollo, as Lily said to her mother late in the evening. Then Bernard covered Lily with hay, which was a great feat in the jocose way for him; and Lily in returning the compliment, almost smothered Mr Crosbie,--by accident.|$|E
