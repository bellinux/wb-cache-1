While {{most of the}} 2000 roster was returning, many up-and-coming stars such as Šarūnas Jasikevičius, Ramūnas Šiškauskas, Darius Songaila, Rimantas Kaukėnas and Robertas Javtokas would make their debut. To prepare for the {{championship}} and give international experience to the young players, Lithuania participated in many prestigious competitions in Europe and South America. In Braunschweig, Germany, Lithuania achieved the third place among the four very capable teams (Yugoslavia, France and Germany). Then the Lithuanian squad played {{for the first time}} in South America, taking part in a four team tournament in Argentina's capital Buenos Aires. Lithuania won two games, including its 500th international victory against Brazil (the last 100 in just 4 years), but only finished second after losing to the hosts Argentina 56–67. Lithuania also competed in the Acropolis Tournament for the second time after nine years, this time losing twice and finished fourth.|$|E

500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Robert Christgau from The Village Voice found Dr. Dre's lyrics distastefully misogynistic, writing [...] "it's <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>Millennium,</b> but he's Still S.L.I.M.E. ... For an hour, with time {{out for some}} memorable Eminem tracks, Dre degrades women every way he can think of, all of which involve his dick." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot said Dr. Dre's production boasted unique elements but [...] "the endless gangsta babble, with its casual misogyny and flippant violence," [...] sounded flagrantly trite. AllMusic's Erlewine spoke of how the number of guest rappers affected the album, and questioned his reasons for collaborating with [...] "pedestrian rappers". He claimed that [...] "the album suffers considerably as a result [...] ". Erlewine criticized the lyrics, which he said were repetitive and full of [...] "gangsta clichés". Sinclair mentioned similar views of the lyrics, calling them [...] "filthy", but noted [...] "none of [...] should diminish Dre's achievement". NME spoke of how the lyrics were too explicit, stating, [...] "As the graphic grooves stretch out, littered with gunfire, bombings and 'copters over Compton, and the bitch-beating baton is handed from Knock-Turnal to Kurupt, 2001 reaches gangsta-rap parody-level with too many tracks coming off like porno-Wu outtakes." [...] Massey referred to the lyrics as a [...] "caricature of an ethos [...] than a reflection of any true prevailing beliefs." ...|$|E

[...] Film critic Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times referred to the special effects in the film as [...] "convincing and remorseless" [...] and that the film was at its strongest point when it [...] "focuses on the sheer enormity of the mission and its consequences". In Variety, Derek Elley wrote that the film was [...] "gripping enough with its solid performances, good-looking CGI, underlying tension and resonant, iron-hard digital soundtrack.
