5|$|Although {{nitrogen}} is non-toxic, when {{released into}} <b>an</b> <b>enclosed</b> space it can displace oxygen, and therefore presents an asphyxiation hazard. This may happen with few warning symptoms, since the human carotid {{body is a}} relatively poor and slow low-oxygen (hypoxia) sensing system. An example occurred shortly before {{the launch of the}} first Space Shuttle mission in 1981, when two technicians died from asphyxiation after they walked into a space located in the Shuttle's Mobile Launcher Platform that was pressurised with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire.|$|E

5|$|Because the liquid-to-gas {{expansion}} ratio of nitrogen is 1:694 at 20°C, {{a tremendous amount}} of force can be generated if liquid nitrogen is rapidly vaporised in <b>an</b> <b>enclosed</b> space. In an incident on January 12, 2006 at Texas A University, the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were malfunctioning and later sealed. As a result of the subsequent pressure buildup, the tank failed catastrophically. The force of the explosion was sufficient to propel the tank through the ceiling immediately above it, shatter a reinforced concrete beam immediately below it, and blow the walls of the laboratory 0.1–0.2m off their foundations.|$|E
5|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day is an action-platform {{game where}} the player {{controls}} Conker the Squirrel {{through a series}} of three-dimensional levels. The game features an overworld where players can transition from one level to another, although many are initially blocked off until Conker earns a certain amount of cash. Each level is <b>an</b> <b>enclosed</b> area in which the player can freely explore to find tasks to do. The gameplay mostly relies on figuring out a way to help other characters by completing a linear sequence of challenges. These challenges may include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, gathering objects, and racing opponents, among others. The result is always a cash reward, which aids access to other areas in the overworld.|$|E
5|$|Dino Crisis {{utilizes}} {{an original}} 3D engine with real-time environments, {{as opposed to}} the pre-rendered backgrounds of the Resident Evil series. Mikami chose a real-time engine to enable better cinematic action and more dramatic character depictions that would otherwise be impossible. However, with the real-time engine came the challenge of hardware limitations, making it difficult for the team to create detailed environments. The team had to forego a jungle scene because of this issue. Mikami did however believe the team was able to create sufficiently detailed environments despite the hardware's polygon limitations. Like Resident Evil, the game takes place indoors in <b>an</b> <b>enclosed</b> environment. Mikami wanted to keep the claustrophobic feelings, thinking it was better to build fear.|$|E
