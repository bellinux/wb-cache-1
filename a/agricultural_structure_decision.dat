The questions answered are what {{is the effect of}} macroeconomic conditions on capital structure and is there a difference in effects across segments? Panel data analysis is applied and a random effects model is used for the sample period 2004 - 2014. Fisher type unit root test is used to test for panel data stationarity. The segments analyzed in the research include; agricultural sector, manufacturing & allied, investment, banking, insurance, construction & allied, energy & petroleum, automobiles & accessories and commercial & services. The leverage ratios tested were debt to equity and total debt ratio. The independent variables tested were GDP, inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, asset tangibility and size. The findings of the study indicate that the macroeconomic determinants do not {{have an effect on the}} capital <b>structure</b> <b>decisions</b> of the listed firms as a whole. Results of the analysis of the different segments concluded that interest rate and inflation had an effect on the <b>agricultural</b> companies' capital <b>structure</b> <b>decisions</b> while interest rate, inflation and exchange rate had an effect on the energy and petroleum industries capital <b>structure</b> <b>decisions.</b> In conclusion none of the macroeconomic determinants affect the industry as a whole but interest rate, inflation and exchange rate are the macroeconomic determinants that are significant across the segments...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{combines}} two rival {{threads of}} the business finance literature: the first filament relates to the firm’s capital <b>structure</b> <b>decisions,</b> with stress on the pecking order theory and the trade off theory; the second filament relates to business clusters, particularly {{in the context of}} emerging markets. The blend is then used to identify a basic model to buttress the capital <b>structure</b> <b>decisions</b> of group-associated and non-group firms. In universal, the results corroborate that affiliated firms are significantly different from their independent counterparts. In terms of their capital <b>structure</b> <b>decision</b> the results show that the average leverage of affiliated firms is higher than the equivalent measures for non-affiliated firms. In terms of the main determinants of capital <b>structure</b> <b>decisions,</b> we found that group association has a strong result on capital <b>structure</b> <b>decisions</b> such that group profitability has a sturdy negative effect on the leverage decisions of affiliated firms. This may be that profitable groups create internal capital markets to avoid having to resort to expensive external finance. Researchers also find that size, as well as growth, does not matter for the capital structure of group-affiliated firms, whereas these factors are critical for the capital <b>structure</b> <b>decisions</b> of independent firms. In addition, only liquidity has a positive force on the capital <b>structure</b> <b>decisions</b> of affiliated firms while intangibility and profitability, group debt and group size has a negative effect. However, researchers do not find any significant differences between group and non-group firms in terms of the impact of age and stock illiquidity on capital <b>structure</b> <b>decisions.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{begins to}} answer the call to broaden current {{theories}} of individual decision-making by including in them the effects of human mood. Grounding our arguments in psychological literature {{on the effects of}} mood on information processing, motivation, and decision heuristics, we develop hypotheses about how mood can significantly affect individuals' use of <b>structured</b> <b>decision</b> protocols. In support of our hypotheses, results from an experimental study of complex decision-making suggest that, in situations where a <b>structured</b> <b>decision</b> protocol is the usual method of decision-making, individuals in moderately negative moods are significantly more likely than those in moderately positive moods to: (1) carefully execute all the steps of a <b>structured</b> <b>decision</b> protocol, (2) execute the steps of a <b>structured</b> <b>decision</b> protocol in the correct order, and (3) rely on the outcome of the <b>structured</b> <b>decision</b> protocol as the primary basis for the decision.

30|$|Numerous {{theories}} {{compete in}} explaining capital <b>structure</b> <b>decisions</b> of a firm. Trade off theory {{is based on}} firm-specific factors to explain the capital <b>structure</b> <b>decisions.</b> The statistical significance of these factors varies across different countries. Pecking order theory is based on information asymmetry to explain capital <b>structure</b> <b>decisions.</b> Explanations put forward by these theories are under debate, {{and it is very}} difficult to ascertain which of these theories better explain capital <b>structure</b> <b>decisions.</b> Empirical evidence from developed countries like UK and USA favor the trade-off theory in these countries while in developing nations of Asia, it is the pecking order theory which explains capital structure of firms in a better way (Pandey 2001; Fan and So 2004). Empirical evidence on capital structure belongs to various countries with China being a market of unique institutional characteristics (Guney et al. 2011). Thus, there is a need to solve the puzzle of which capital structure theory better explains the capital structure of Asian markets. There is an important study about capital <b>structure</b> <b>decisions</b> in Hong Kong (Fan and So 2004). They argue that firms listed in Hong Kong are influenced by the pecking order theory in their capital <b>structure</b> <b>decisions.</b> However, the pecking order theory is under debate both in Asian and in developed countries like USA and Europe (Frank and Goyal 2003).|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of competitive and efficient <b>agricultural</b> <b>structures</b> {{has been one}} of the central goals of agricultural policy making in addition to ensuring a fair standard of living for farmers. To achieve these goals, the agricultural sector in most industrialised nations has long been the subject of government interven­tions. However, many agricultural policies have worked counteractively to these goals by creating distortions in the use of resources. Against this background, the emergence of new and innovative modelling methods such as agent- based models, in addition to ever-in­creasing computing capacities has offered new possibilities to model adjustment reactions and to quantify the impact of agri­cultural policies. This thesis takes up these new methodologies and applies them to the modelling and evaluation of agricultural policy impacts on regional struc­tural change. At the centre of the thesis is the {{development of}} the spatial and dynamic simula­tion model of regional <b>agricultural</b> <b>structures</b> AgriPoliS (<b>Agricultural</b> Policy Simulator). The core of AgriPoliS is the understanding of a regional <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure</b> as an agent-based system, i. e., a system of interacting heterogeneous agents. The thesis contributes to a deeper un­derstanding of struc­tural change dynamics and factors causing structural change. It is studied whether and to what extent policy changes can facilitate structural adjustment towards a more efficient and competitive <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure.</b> agent-based modelling, structural change, agricultural policy, simulation, efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{discussions of}} actuarial risk {{assessment}} utility in child welfare and juvenile justice emphasizes its comparative predictive validity with clinical methods of prediction. While important, it ignores how actuarial risk assessment instruments actually influences the clinical deliberations of their users. Recent literature extends {{the discussion of}} their clinical utility by invoking evidence based practice principles. Implicit in this discussion is a traditional model of <b>structured</b> <b>decision</b> making, common in child welfare and juvenile justice agencies, whereby actuarial risk assessment is supplemented with contextual needs assessment. This article critiques the traditional model of <b>structured</b> <b>decision</b> making and argues that its limitations are inconsistent {{with the spirit of}} evidence based practice. Instead, a revised model of <b>structured</b> <b>decision</b> making, grounded in research on risk and resilience, promises a more complete integration with evidence based practice.
