5000|$|When plants {{continuously}} {{release a}} baseline level of volatiles, these defenses {{are said to}} be constitutive. Upon an instance of herbivory, however, the plant may respond by considerably increasing its production of volatiles or by producing a new profile of volatiles. This plasticity is controlled by either the jasmonic acid pathway or the salicylic acid pathway, depending largely on the herbivore; these substances are often called herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). Though volatiles of any kind have an <b>attractive</b> <b>effect</b> on natural enemies, this effect is stronger for damaged plants than for undamaged plants, perhaps because induced volatiles signal definitive and recent herbivore activity. The phenomenon of inducibility gives rise to the idea that plants are sending out a [...] "distress call" [...] to the third trophic level in times of herbivore attack.|$|E

40|$|What has transpired {{immediately}} before {{has a strong}} influence on how sensory stimuli are processed and perceived. In particular, temporal context can have contrastive effects, repelling perception away from {{the interpretation of the}} context stimulus, and <b>attractive</b> <b>effects,</b> whereby perception repeats upon successive presentations of the same stimulus. For decades, scientists have documented contrastive and <b>attractive</b> temporal context <b>effects</b> mostly in low-level vision. But both types of effects also occur in other modalities, e. g., audition and touch, and for stimuli of varying complexity, raising the possibility that context effects reflect general computational principles of sensory systems. Neuroimaging shows that contrastive and <b>attractive</b> context <b>effects</b> arise from neural processes in different areas of the cerebral cortex, suggesting two separate operations with distinct functional roles. Bayesian models can provide a functional account of both context effects, whereby prior experience adjusts sensory systems to optimize perception of future stimuli...|$|R

5000|$|Another of {{the major}} {{applications}} of polyelectrolyte adsorption is the stabilization (or destabilization) of solid colloidal suspensions, or sols. Particles in solution tend to have attractive forces similar to van der Waals forces, modeled by Hamaker theory. These forces tend to cause colloidal particles to aggregate or flocculate. The Hamaker <b>attractive</b> <b>effect</b> is balanced by {{one or both of}} two repulsive effects of colloids in solution. The first is electrostatic stabilization, in which like charges of the particles repel one another. This effect is due to the zeta potential that exists due to a particle's surface charge in solution. [...] The second is steric stabilization, due to steric effects. Drawing particles together with adsorbed polymer chains greatly decreases the conformational entropy of the polymer chains at the surface, which is thermodynamically unfavorable, making flocculation and coagulation more difficult.|$|E

5000|$|The {{expansion}} of space is sometimes {{described as a}} force which acts to push objects apart. Though this is an accurate description {{of the effect of}} the cosmological constant, it is not an accurate picture of the phenomenon of expansion in general. For much of the universe's history the expansion has been due mainly to inertia. The matter in the very early universe was flying apart for unknown reasons (most likely as a result of cosmic inflation) and has simply continued to do so, though at an ever-decreasing rate due to the <b>attractive</b> <b>effect</b> of gravity.In addition to slowing the overall expansion, gravity causes local clumping of matter into stars and galaxies. Once objects are formed and bound by gravity, they [...] "drop out" [...] of the expansion and do not subsequently expand {{under the influence of the}} cosmological metric, there being no force compelling them to do so.|$|E

In the current study, temporal patterns of the audience’s attention were observed using eyeblink responses. To determine the effect of interactions among audience members on cognitive entrainment, as well as its direction (attractive or repulsive), the eyeblink synchronization of the following two groups were compared: (1) the experimental condition, where the audience members (seven fre-quent viewers and seven first-time viewers) viewed live performances in situ, and (2) the control condition, where the audience members (15 frequent viewers and 15 first-time view-ers) viewed videotaped performances in individual experimental settings (results reported in previous study.) The results of this study demonstrated that the mean values of a measure of asynchrony (i. e.,D interval) were much lower for the experimental condition than for the control condition. Frequent viewers had a moderate <b>attractive</b> <b>effect</b> that increased as the story pro-gressed, while a strong <b>attractive</b> <b>effect</b> was observed throughout the story for first-time view-ers.

So in this paper the experimental method is adopted to measure the second-order buoyancy received by permanent magnet immersed in magnetic fluid, which depends on the distance between the magnet and the wall of vessel. The influence of the diameter of cylindrical vessels, the size of magnets and the saturation magnetization of magnetic fluid on the buoyancy is also analyzed qualitatively...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} {{sustained}} and transient responses to inducing {{lines on the}} perceived position of nearby test lines were measured as constant errors in the vernier alignment of the test lines.

Transient responses to the onset of the inducing lines had <b>attractive</b> <b>effects</b> for small distances, whereas transient responses to the offset of the inducing lines had repulsive effects for all distances tested.

40|$|A {{moderate}} heating (170 °C- 70 hours), under vacuum, modifies the Niobium cavity features: · at 4. 2 K the BCS {{resistance is}} reduced by 46 %, · at 1. 5 K the high field Qo(Eacc) slope is smoothed off with an unchanged residual resistance value. This is a very <b>attractive</b> <b>effect</b> for the high gradient quest. These modifications are induced by the electron mean free path shortening, due to an oxygen diffusion into the superconducting material. In agreement with these results we develop a hypothesis about the Qo(Eacc) slope that {{take into account the}} NbOx superconducting layer and the magnetic field dependence on the energy gap. ...|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that gradients of chemotropic molecules are instrumental to the wiring {{of the nervous}} system.

Here, we show that stabilized gradients of increasing semaphorin concentrations elicit stereotyped responses from cortical growth cones, independent of the absolute concentration and the slope of these gradients. In contrast, neither repulsive effects of Sema 3 A nor <b>attractive</b> <b>effects</b> of Sema 3 C were observed when axons were growing toward decreasing semaphorin concentrations. Thus, growth cone guidance by gradients of chemotropic molecules is robust and reproducible, because it is primarily independent of the exact dimensions of the gradients...|$|R
