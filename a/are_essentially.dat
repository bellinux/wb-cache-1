Robinson arithmetic is known to <b>be</b> <b>essentially</b> undecidable, and thus every consistent theory that includes or interprets Robinson arithmetic <b>is</b> also (<b>essentially)</b> undecidable.|$|R

5|$|Hadley has {{considered}} {{the ethics of}} humans' relationships with wild animals and environments beyond his property rights theory.

He argues that libertarian property rights, consistent with Robert Nozick's interpretation of the Lockean proviso, should limit the right to destroy human-owned natural environments.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} 2-way design {{consisted of}} two 150-4C bass drivers with 4-inch coils, and two H5038P-100 elliptical horns.

In 1960, after feedback from foreign distributors, the Paragon {{was made into a}} 3-way loudspeaker by adding two 075 ring radiators (tweeters) mounted {{in the back of the}} cabinet and aimed at the central 'sweet spot'. Bass–mid crossover was at 500Hz and mid–treble frequencies crossed over at 7kHz.|$|E
5|$|The {{student council}} {{is a group}} of {{students}} which provides a liaison between the teachers and students.

The three committees are closely related and work together to preserve the peace on campus.|$|E

On the other hand, overall patterns of cusps and ridges <b>are</b> <b>essentially</b> similar among Ferugliotherium, Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica, indicating that the three are closely related.|$|E
5|$|A {{ski flying}} event {{consists}} of several preliminary stages, {{culminating in a}} competition to decide a winner and subsequent order. Within an event there are up to three competitions – individual, and sometimes team – all taking place on separate days. These competitions are contested somewhat differently depending on whether an event is staged {{as part of the}} Ski Flying World Championships or Ski Flying World Cup. In both events, a 'training' round takes place on the opening day, as well as a 'trial' round before each competition; these non-scoring rounds <b>are</b> <b>essentially</b> practice or warm-up sessions, and athlete participation is optional.|$|E
5|$|Associations {{are known}} with several plant families. In the Northern Hemisphere, these <b>are</b> <b>essentially</b> the {{well-known}} ectomycorrhizal {{trees and shrubs}} in the Betulaceae, Fagaceae, Pinaceae and Salicaceae, but in arctic and alpine habitats, Russulaceae also associate with Bistorta vivipara (Polygonaceae), Kobresia (Cyperaceae), and Dryas octopetala (Rosaceae), ectomycorrhizal plants untypic in their respective families. In the tropics, known plant partners include Dipterocarpaceae, Fabaceae, Nyctaginaceae, Phyllanthaceae, Polygonaceae (Coccoloba), Sarcolaenaceae, and the gymnosperm Gnetum gnemon, and in the Southern Hemisphere, Nothofagaceae, Myrtaceae (Eucalyptus and Leptospermum), and Rhamnaceae (Pomaderris). Some Russulaceae are quite specialised in their ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, such as Lactarius and Russula species that only grow with Cistus shrubs in the Mediterranean basin.|$|E
