5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, Wijnhamer, known as PahWongso, was {{recognised}} in West Java for his promotion of social causes. These included promoting monogamy <b>and</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> western medicine, {{as well as}} combating gambling {{and the use of}} opium and alcohol. In conveying his messages he often used the Sundanese wayang golek (a form of rod puppet), as the local people were generally unable to read. He was able to speak Dutch, Malay, and Javanese fluently, and had some command of Chinese and Japanese. This social work was funded predominantly from PahWongso's day job, selling fried peanuts (kacang goreng).|$|E

5|$|Some {{essential}} {{features of}} Modernisme were: an anticlassical language inherited from Romanticism with {{a tendency to}} lyricism and subjectivity; the determined connection of architecture with the applied arts and artistic work that produced an overtly ornamental style; the use of new materials from which emerged a mixed constructional language, rich in contrasts, that sought a plastic effect for the whole; {{a strong sense of}} optimism <b>and</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> progress that produced an emphatic art that reflected the atmosphere of prosperity of the time, above all of the esthetic of the bourgeoisie.|$|E
5|$|What had {{appeared}} at the outset to be a brief and straightforward military intervention led to a full-scale war in South America's southeast. However, {{the possibility of a}} two-front conflict (with Britain and Paraguay) faded when, in September 1865, the British government sent an envoy who publicly apologized for the crisis between the empires. The Paraguayan invasion in 1864 led to a conflict far longer than expected, <b>and</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> the progressive cabinet's ability to prosecute the war vanished. Also, from its inception, the Progressive League was plagued by internal conflict between factions formed by former moderate conservatives and by former liberals.|$|E
5|$|Shaw is {{the only}} {{religious}} believer in the crew and openly displays her religious belief with a necklace of a Christian cross. Lindelof said that with her scientific knowledge, her beliefs felt outdated in 2093. Shaw is excited when she learns that she {{was created by the}} Engineers and not a supernatural deity, but rather than cause her to lose her faith, it reinforces it. Lindelof said that asking questions and searching for meaning is the point of being alive, and so the audience is left to question whether Shaw was protected by God because of her faith. Scott wanted the film to end with Shaw's declaration that she is still searching for definitive answers. In addition to the religious themes, Lindelof said that Prometheus is pro-science and explores whether scientific knowledge <b>and</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> God can co-exist.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the poem, Gawain {{encounters}} numerous trials testing {{his devotion}} <b>and</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> Christianity. When Gawain sets {{out on his}} journey to find the Green Chapel, he finds himself lost, and only after praying to the Virgin Mary does he find his way. As he continues his journey, Gawain once again faces anguish regarding his inevitable encounter with the Green Knight. Instead of praying to Mary, as before, Gawain places his faith in the girdle {{given to him by}} Bertilak's wife. From the Christian perspective, this leads to disastrous and embarrassing consequences for Gawain as he is forced to reevaluate his faith when the Green Knight points out his betrayal. Another interpretation sees the work in terms of the perfection of virtue, with the pentangle representing the moral perfection of the connected virtues, the Green Knight as Christ exhibiting perfect fortitude, and Gawain as slightly imperfect in fortitude by virtue of flinching when under the threat of death.|$|E
