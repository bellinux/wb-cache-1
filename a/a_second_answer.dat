And because I say, this thou mayest have and do, as thou thinkest, perfectly too [as thou thinks, mark that] as those fond hypocrites, called Quakers [think] that they also do, and yet be but a natural man. Here my adversary is very much offended, and calls me perverter of the right way of the Lord; and saith, Shew me any natural man in the scripture that hath done it. Whereas had he been but willing to have laid down the scripture I brought to prove it, he needed not to have looked for <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>answer.</b> But because he would have it again, I will therefore shew you, that natural men merely by nature may be convinced, and abstain from those things forbidden in the law, and think they do it perfectly, nay, they do the things contained in the law. For saith the apostle (Rom 2:14), [...] "when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature [mark, do by nature] the things contained in the law, these, [the Gentiles] having not the law, are a law unto themselves." [...] Mark; the Gentiles do by nature the things contained in, or held forth, or made mention of by the law; the light also that they have, it is themselves, being a law to themselves; that is, their consciences (being of themselves) bearing them witness and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing, or else excusing one another (verse 15), though they cannot be saved thereby.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{considers}} three general {{views about}} the nature of moral obligation and three particular answers (with which these views are typically associated) concerning the following question: if on Monday you lend me a book that I promise to return to you by Friday, what precisely is my obligation to you and what constitutes its fulfillment? The example is borrowed from W. D.

In Foundations of Ethics Ross repudiated the Objective View in favor of the Subjective View, from which he inferred <b>a</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Answer.</b> In this paper the Objective and Subjective Views and the First and Second Answers are each rejected in favor of the Prospective View and a Third Answer.

For example, we and our students need {{the ability to think}} across time and space in order to gain multiple points of view.

40|$|We {{prove that}} the local (pseudo) group of biholomorphisms {{stabilizing}} a minimal, finitely nondegenerate real algebraic submanifold in C^n is a real algebraic local Lie group (the works of S.

We deduce necessary conditions for the local algebraizability of real analytic rigid tubes of arbitrary codimension in C^n.

40|$|One of {{the core}} {{principles}} of contract law is the requirement of definiteness. Conventional wisdom holds, however, that the indefiniteness doctrine is largely ignored by courts. In this Article, Professor Scott examines the contemporary case law on indefinite contracts and his review yields three striking findings. First, there is a surprisingly high volume of litigation. Second, the indefiniteness doctrine lives on in the common law of contracts. Third, {{a large number of}} the indefiniteness cases involve contracts that are "deliberately" incomplete-that is, parties have declined to condition performance on available, verifiable measures that could be specified in the contract at relatively low cost. These findings raise a fundamental question: Why do parties write deliberately incomplete agreements {{in the shadow of a}} robust indefiniteness doctrine? One answer is that these agreements may be self-enforcing. But most of the recently litigated cases involve contracts that do not appear to be self-enforcing in the traditional sense. <b>A</b> <b>second</b> <b>answer</b> is indicated by recent work in experimental economics, which suggests that roughly half the population behave as if reciprocity were an important motivation, while the other half react as if motivated entirely by self-interest. This evidence of a taste for "reciprocal fairness" in nearly half the population, argues Professor Scott, may expand the domain of self-enforcing contracts beyond what is conventionally understood. It may also support a theory that predicts that deliberately incomplete contracts that rely on self-enforcement through reciprocal fairness between strangers are more efficient than the alternative of more complete, legally enforceable agreements...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT—Where does value come from? I {{propose a}} new {{answer to this}} classic question. People {{experience}} regulatory fit when the manner of their engagement in an activity sustains their goal orientation or interests regarding that activity. When there is fit, people engage more strongly in {{what they are doing}} and ‘‘feel right’ ’ about it. Fit influences the strength of value experiences—how good or how bad one feels about something—independently of the pleasure and pain experiences that are associated with outcomes. It uniquely contributes to people’s experience of the value of things. Fit is shown to influence judgments and decision making, attitude and behavior change, and task performance. KEYWORDS—value; evaluation; activity engagement; decision making; attitude change; performance What makes people value something? A classic answer is that values are socialized shared beliefs about ideal objectives and allowable procedures for attaining them (e. g., Merton, 1957). <b>A</b> <b>second</b> <b>answer</b> relates value to usefulness and emphasizes need satisfaction rather than beliefs. For example, Adam Smith’s (1994 / 1776) prime example of an object with high value was water. From the time of the Ancient Greeks, a third answer has emphasized value as experience, especially hedonic experiences of pleasure and pain. In this paper, I present evidence for a type of value experience separate from hedonic experiences: the regulatory fit that people experience when the manner of their engagement in an activity sustains their goal orientation or interests regarding that activity. I propose that all value is an experience of the attraction toward or repulsion from something whose intensity {{is a function of the}} strength of two factors—the strength of hedonic pleasure or pain and the strength of engagement (see Higgins, 2005). Regulatory fit contributes to value through increasing strength of engagement. It makes people ‘‘feel right’ ’ about whatever they are doing, and thus has a broad influence on judgments and decision making, attitude and behavior change, and task performance...|$|E
40|$|This article {{uses the}} history of the Fair Labor Standards Act 2 ̆ 7 s minimum wage {{provisions}} to examine how statutes that benefit interests that are comparatively weak in the political market become law. The article tracks {{the history of}} the American debate over fairness in wages beginning with the demise of slavery through the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938 in search of an answer. The search yields two answers. The first answer is that bargaining power is dynamic, not static. The article discusses the socio-economic crises and effective political advocacy by living wage proponents that changed the political bargaining calculus. It also discusses the normative approaches to fairness in wages - that is, conceptions of fairness - offered to remedy the ill effects of employers 2 ̆ 7 superior bargaining power in the labor market and how they rose and fell with the changing political environment. In particular, the article discusses how the 2 ̆ 2 Fairness is a Living Wage 2 ̆ 2 conception (2 ̆ 2 Absolute Fairness 2 ̆ 2) would have required employers to pay each worker at least a wage sufficient to support a family while 2 ̆ 2 Fairness is Equality of Bargaining Power 2 ̆ 2 (2 ̆ 2 Bargaining Fairness 2 ̆ 2) would have imposed the procedural remedy of 2 ̆ 2 public bargaining 2 ̆ 2 over wages and hours in hopes that subsistence wages would result. A vigorous Spencerist majority on the Supreme Court used its own conception of fairness in wages, 2 ̆ 2 Fairness is the Economic Hierarchy 2 ̆ 2 (2 ̆ 2 Hierarchic Fairness 2 ̆ 2), to block state laws codifying the conception of Bargaining Fairness and preserve the economic status quo. The pre-FLSA debate over fairness in wages was largely a struggle between Bargaining Fairness and Hierarchic Fairness. The article also introduces the conception that 2 ̆ 2 Fairness is Fair Competition 2 ̆ 2 (2 ̆ 2 Competitive Fairness 2 ̆ 2) which would prohibit some low wages and excessive hours as a means to fairness between employers, not as a means to fairness for workers. The FLSA codified this conception of Competitive Fairness and thereby offered <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>answer</b> {{to the question of how}} a statute that benefits politically disempowered people became law. The FLSA also benefits politically empowered employers. Since passage of the FLSA, the courts have reentered the debate over fairness in wages through the debate over which workers are 2 ̆ 2 employees 2 ̆ 2 entitled to the FLSA 2 ̆ 7 s protections. In essence, the courts have abandoned Competitive Fairness. Courts hold that only those workers who are 2 ̆ 2 dependent 2 ̆ 2 on their employers are entitled to the minimum wage protections guaranteed by the FLSA. This artificial threshold amounts to a rejection of the long-standing consensus that workers in the low-wage labor market lack sufficient individual bargaining power to protect themselves against employers 2 ̆ 7 wage demands. This judicial construct reflects a sixth conception of fairness extant, but hidden, in the current judicial interpretation of the FLSA 2 ̆ 7 s definition of 2 ̆ 2 employee. 2 ̆ 2 The article argues that 2 ̆ 2 Fairness is an Implied Contract 2 ̆ 2 is wholly inconsistent not only with the entire history of the American debate over fairness in wages that preceded the FLSA, but with the purpose and structure of the FLSA itself. It also discusses courts 2 ̆ 7 role in the political balance between stronger and weaker parties in the political market...|$|E
