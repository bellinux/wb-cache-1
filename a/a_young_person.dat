5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of Brygida Kürbis, it can be concluded that the 10-year marriage of Przemysł II and Ludgarda wasn't successful, and over time it became more obvious to everyone that the ducal couple was unable to have children, although this couldn't be completely certain, because Ludgarda in 1283 was at most only 23 years old. Nevertheless, is assumed that Przemysł II's growing aversion to his wife because of her infertility was well known by all. So when in mid-December 1283 Ludgarda died suddenly and separated (evidenced by her death in Gniezno, away from Przemysł II's court in Poznań), raised suspicion that the death of the duchess was unnatural. Nobody, however, had evidence of this. Contributing to rumors was that in the 13th century medical knowledge was negligible, and therefore often sudden death of <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>person</b> was interpreted as unnatural. In addition, the duke's rejection of a proper mourning to his wife, who was universally liked, increased the suspicions against Przemysł II.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive deficits {{that can}} follow TBI include {{impaired}} attention; disrupted insight, judgement, and thought; reduced processing speed; distractibility; and deficits in executive {{functions such as}} abstract reasoning, planning, problem-solving, and multitasking. Memory loss, the most common cognitive impairment among head-injured people, occurs in 20–79% of people with closed head trauma, depending on severity. People who have suffered TBI may also have difficulty with understanding or producing spoken or written language, or with more subtle aspects of communication such as body language. Post-concussion syndrome, a set of lasting symptoms experienced after mild TBI, can include physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral problems such as headaches, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, and depression. Multiple TBIs may have a cumulative effect. <b>A</b> <b>young</b> <b>person</b> who receives a second concussion before symptoms from another one have healed {{may be at risk}} for developing a very rare but deadly condition called second-impact syndrome, in which the brain swells catastrophically after even a mild blow, with debilitating or deadly results. About one in five career boxers is affected by chronic traumatic brain injury (CTBI), which causes cognitive, behavioral, and physical impairments. Dementia pugilistica, the severe form of CTBI, affects primarily career boxers years after a boxing career. It commonly manifests as dementia, memory problems, and parkinsonism (tremors and lack of coordination).|$|E

Many jurisdictions regard any sexual activity by an adult involving a child as child sexual abuse.|$|E

25|$|Rapping {{grew up in}} Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. At a young age, Rapping went to {{demonstrations and}} protests with his mother, Elayne Rapping, a {{community}} organizer, activist and professor in Pittsburgh. Rapping's mother was particularly involved in the anti-war and women’s movements.

50|$|The age of <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>person</b> matters {{substantially}} {{as under}} the Sexual Offences Act 2003 any sexual intercourse or {{any type of}} sexual activity with a person {{under the age of}} 13 is strictly illegal, with rape, assault by penetration and incitement offences carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and other non-penetration offences carrying a maximum sentence of 14 years depending on case. Where as if <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>person</b> is aged between 13-15, the act does work more flexibly, as for example it is a reasonable defence by an older person to claim they thought <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>person</b> aged 13-15 was aged 16 or over at the time, or for example that two teenagers over the age of 13 were in a relationship before any sexual intercourse took place. It is rare that prosecution would be brought against persons aged 13 or over engaging in sexual intercourse/activity willingly, as long as all persons involved were of similar age, and it did not involve other matters such as violence, abuse or blackmail.|$|R

500|$|Varian {{grew up in}} Halcyon, California with {{a strong}} {{interest}} in horses, combined with a fondness for horse books such as the works of Marguerite Henry and The Black Stallion series written by Walter Farley. She credited Farley's books as the origin of her interest in Arabian horses. [...] She was given her first horse, a Morgan-Percheron crossbred, at the age of eight, and rode bareback until she obtained her first saddle at age 12. Although her parents, Eric and Wenonah Varian, did not have an equestrian background, they always supported her interest in horses, allowing both her and her older sister the freedom to ride horses as much as they wanted. [...] Varian matured to be [...] tall, and has stated that while she [...] "struggled" [...] with her height as <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>person,</b> she found comfort in riding horses: [...] "all my troubles went away." ...|$|E
500|$|While at {{the amateur}} clubs, Valbuena also honed his quickness, {{technical}} ability, and developed his tenacious {{style of play}} which contributed to his positive work-rate defensively. Léglise once stated that [...] "he had never worked with such <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>person</b> so technically brilliant" [...] in his coaching career. Valbuena's former coach also described the player's tenacious style stating [...] "Whatever the build of the opponent, he will always tackle" [...] and [...] "he also surprised me {{with the level of}} his defensive work when he is aligned on the right-hand side". Valbuena is also known for his small size and, while at Langon, began using his diminutive stature to his advantage. During his first season at Marseille, he earned the nickname le petit by his former manager Eric Gerets. Gerets described the player as [...] "extremely mobile" [...] and a player who is [...] "very quick at turning, {{from one side to the}} other".|$|E
500|$|The North American {{release was}} {{scheduled}} for July 11, 2008, but was delayed until August 15, before being brought forward to August 13.

Studios consider the third week of August to be a weaker performing period than earlier in the summer because of students returning to school.
