5|$|<b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> {{created during}} {{executive}} producer Russell T Davies original pitch to the BBC {{as part of}} his plans to revive Doctor Who for the channel. Though established early in the series' planning, <b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> always intended to be a short-term character. Though reviewers generally reacted negatively to the character, Adam's role as a foil to the stock companion figure has been praised alongside the moral lessons of his departure.|$|E
5|$|Adam Mitchell is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who, played by Bruno Langley. Adam is introduced in the first series of the programme's revival as the second television companion of the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston). However, unlike the Ninth Doctor's primary companion, Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), who provided an effective human contrast to the Doctor's centuries-old alien, <b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> created to provide {{an example of an}} inept time traveller.|$|E
5|$|Adolphe <b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> {{a popular}} writer of ballet and opera music in early 19th-century France. He wrote with great speed and {{completed}} Giselle {{in about two}} months. The music {{was written in the}} smooth, song-like style of the day called cantilena. This style is well known to music lovers from Bellini's opera Norma and Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor.|$|E
50|$|Okere <b>Adams</b> <b>is</b> a Sierra Leonean politician. In 2002, <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> {{appointed}} as the Minister of Marine Resources under Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.

5|$|After the Jacobite rising of 1745, Adam's {{position}} as Mason to the Board of Ordnance {{brought him a}} number of large military contracts in the Highlands. In 1746, the position of Master Carpenter to the Board of Ordnance became vacant, and <b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> quick to put forward his son John's name for consideration, although he was unsuccessful in securing him the post. His three eldest sons were all involved in the family business by 1746, James and John both leaving Edinburgh University early to join their father.|$|E
5|$|For Your Eyes Only {{marked a}} change in the {{production}} crew: John Glen was promoted from his duties as a film editor to director, a position he would occupy for the next four films. Since Ken <b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> busy with the film Pennies from Heaven, Peter Lamont, who had worked in the art department since Goldfinger, was promoted to production designer. Following a suggestion from Glen, Lamont created realistic sets, instead of the elaborate scenery for which the series had been known.|$|E
5|$|In 1741 <b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> {{forced to}} {{initiate}} legal proceedings against William, Lord Braco, to retrieve unpaid fees arising {{from his work}} at Duff House. There was no formal contract, and client and architect disagreed on costs for carved stonework. Adam sued for £5,796 12s 11⅓d, and the matter was initially resolved in his favour. However, Braco was a stubborn opponent, and dragged out the proceedings, which were not resolved until just before Adam's death.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the comic}} book series Haunted, <b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> once a human member of the Initiative tasked with {{protecting}} Professor Walsh. The ghost of Mayor Richard Wilkins, however, took over {{the body of a}} vampire, which was then captured by the Initiative. Desperate to escape, the Mayor moved to the body of a dead demon and killed Adam. Having been one of her favorite agents, Professor Walsh vowed to bring him back to life and placed his body in her 314 Project. However, due to the complex nature of the Buffyverse, this chain of events may not, in fact, be canonical.|$|E
5|$|Adam Mickiewicz {{was born}} on 24 December 1798, either at his {{paternal}} uncle's estate in Zaosie (now Zavosse) near Navahrudak (in Polish, Nowogródek) or in Navahrudak itself {{in what was then}} part of the Russian Empire and is now Belarus. The region was on the periphery of Lithuania proper and {{had been part of the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania until the Third Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1795). Its upper class, including Mickiewicz's family, were either Polish or Polonized. The poet's father, Mikołaj Mickiewicz, a lawyer, was a member of the Polish nobility (szlachta) and bore the hereditary Poraj coat-of-arms; Adam's mother was Barbara Mickiewicz, née Majewska. <b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> the second-born son in the family.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the first répétition générale of Giselle {{on the stage}} of the Paris Opéra, the danseuse Nathalie Fitz-James used her influence as the mistress of an influential patron of the theatre to have a pas inserted for herself into the ballet. Jean Coralli was required to quickly arrange a number for Fitz-James, which was arranged by Coralli as a pas de deux with the danseur Auguste Mabille serving as Fitz-James's partner. Coralli's original intentions were to have the ballet's composer Adolphe Adam supply the music for Fitz-James's pas, but by this time <b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> unavailable. In light of this, Coralli chose a suite by the composer Friedrich Burgmüller's titled Souvenirs de Ratisbonne to fashion music for Fitz-James's required pas. This pas de deux, which was dubbed the Pas des paysans (or Peasant pas de deux), became part of the ballet's performance tradition.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the sixth book, Clement intends to demonstrate that the works of Greek poets were derived from the prophetic books of the Bible. In order to reinforce his position that the Greeks were inclined towards plagiarism, he cites numerous instances of such inappropriate appropriation by classical Greek writers, reported second-hand from On Plagiarism, an anonymous 3rd century BC work sometimes ascribed to Aretades. Clement then digresses to the subject of sin and hell, arguing that <b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> not perfect when created, but given the potential to achieve perfection. He espouses broadly universalist doctrine, holding that Christ's promise of salvation is available to all, even those condemned to hell.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} how William Adam became a {{successful}} architect from these beginnings, but by 1721 he was engaged on major projects at Floors Castle, where he executed a design by Vanbrugh, and designing extensions to Hopetoun House. John Gifford links Adam's rise with the retirement of James Smith, the most prominent architect of the early 18th century, who was in his 70s by this time. Like Smith, <b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> a trained mason, had social connections through his family, and had the financial backing of successful business ventures. It was in 1721 that Adam became a Freemason being initiated in The Lodge of Edinburgh (Mary's Chapel), No.1.|$|E
5|$|Lasers did {{not exist}} in 1959 when the book was written, nor did {{high-power}} industrial lasers at the time the film was made, making them a novelty. In the novel, Goldfinger uses a circular saw to try to kill Bond, but the filmmakers changed it to a laser to make the film feel fresher. Hamilton immediately thought of giving the laser a place in the film's story as Goldfinger's weapon of choice. Ken <b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> advised on the laser's design by two Harvard scientists who helped design the water reactor in Dr No. The laser beam itself was an optical effect added in post-production. For close-ups where the flame cuts through metal, technician Bert Luxford heated the metal with a blowtorch from underneath the table to which Bond was strapped.|$|E
50|$|Cat's son, <b>Adam,</b> <b>is</b> one {{of several}} {{children}} abducted by the Toyman, and <b>Adam</b> <b>is</b> murdered {{when he tries to}} escape. Cat deals with the loss by focusing on her work.|$|R

5|$|The character's {{death was}} and {{continues}} to be ranked in public polls of various opinions. It was voted Best Drama Moment on the BBC's annual TV Moments broadcast in 2004. The same year, a poll conducted for National Pub Week ranked the scene where a barman scoops some of Rachel's ashes into a bucket the fifth best of various pub-related television scenes. In 2008, the death was ranked at number three in Sky One's 50 Greatest TV Endings programme. In a 2010 public poll to promote Freeview HD, Rachel's death was ranked as the seventh most emotional TV moment. In 2011, Rachel's wedding to <b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> placed at number nine in Channel 5's Greatest TV Weddings programme. Colin McAllister opined that every woman's heart broke when they married.|$|E
5|$|The {{costs of}} keeping the women imprisoned in the tolbooth at Pittenweem were {{becoming}} prohibitive; on 12 August, after payment of five hundred marks, all the women except Cornfoot were released on bail. In September Morton was summoned to give evidence to the Privy Council but he had fully regained his health and displayed no symptoms of being possessed. <b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> questioned by the Privy Council in October and freed. In November, Laing, Lawson, Horsefoot and Wallace were released after paying a fine of £8 each; but {{the last of the}} accused, Cornfoot, was kept in solitary confinement in the tolbooth by Cowper. One of the prison guards, who perhaps felt sorry for her, put her in a cell with a window low enough for her to escape so she also gained her freedom.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} a success, earning {{a total of}} $141.2 million worldwide, {{exceeding}} the earnings of the three previous Bond films. In 1966, John Stears won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and production designer Ken <b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> also nominated for a BAFTA award. Thunderball is the most financially successful film of the series when adjusting for ticket price inflation. Some critics and viewers showered praise on the film and branded it a welcome addition to the series, while others complained of the repetitively monotonous aquatic action and prolonged length. In 1983, Warner Bros. released a second film adaptation of the novel under the title Never Say Never Again, with McClory as executive producer.|$|E

5000|$|The Adams family famously [...] "lived plainly." [...] Together {{they raised}} {{a family of}} three sons, of which John <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> the oldest; their other sons were Peter and Elihu. [...] Peter Boylston <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> a farmer and militia captain of Braintree, Massachusetts. Elihu <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> a company {{commander}} in the militia during the American Revolution, who died from a dysentery early in the war in 1775.|$|R
50|$|When his regiment's brigade commander, Brigadier General Adley H. Gladden {{was killed}} {{on the first day}} of the Battle of Shiloh, Adams assumed command of the brigade. Soon thereafter, <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> wounded in further {{fighting}} at the Hornet's Nest and lost his right eye. <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> so severely wounded that the driver of the wagon in which he was being transported with other wounded soldiers left the senseless and muddy general for dead along the muddy road to lighten the wagon's load. <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> saved when passing soldiers of the 10th Mississippi Infantry Regiment noticed that <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> alive.|$|R
5|$|At the 1965 Academy Awards, Norman Wanstall won the Academy Award for Best Sound Effects Editing for his work, making Goldfinger {{the first}} Bond film {{to receive an}} Academy Award. John Barry was {{nominated}} for the Grammy Award for Best Score for a Motion Picture, and Ken <b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> nominated for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) for Best British Art Direction (Colour), where he also won the award for Best British Art Direction (Black and White) for Dr. Strangelove. The American Film Institute has honoured the film four times: ranking it No.90 for best movie quote ("A martini. Shaken, not stirred"), No.53 for best song ("Goldfinger"), No. 49 for best villain (Auric Goldfinger), and No.71 for most thrilling film. In 2006, Entertainment Weekly and IGN both named Goldfinger as the best Bond film, while MSN named it as the second best, behind its predecessor. IGN and EW also named Pussy Galore as the second best Bond girl. In 2008, Total Film named Goldfinger as the best film in the series. The Times placed Goldfinger and Oddjob second and third on their list of the best Bond villains in 2008. They also named the Aston Martin DB5 as the best car in the films.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} the last series, Rachel returns from London and tells Adam that she aborted the baby, and their {{relationship}} seems over for good. They both start seeing other people—he one of Pete's colleagues (Rosie Cavaliero) and she a man much younger than her (Hugh Dancy)—but reconcile after Adam is diagnosed and treated for testicular cancer in Episode 5. David is made redundant at work and decides to be a stay-at-home dad for Josh. After some interference from Karen, he takes a new job. Their relationship improves from the first series; they spend their wedding anniversary in Paris and Karen announces in Episode 6 that she is pregnant. Pete and Jenny's marriage deteriorates when she reveals she {{had a crush on}} Adam. Pete later sleeps with a co-worker— with whom <b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> also briefly involved—and Jenny tells him {{to move out of the}} house. They decide to give their marriage another chance when Adam's cancer puts things into perspective. In Episode 6, all three couples see in the new millennium on a trip to Lindisfarne, where Pete and Jenny's relationship worsens again as the others' improve.|$|E
5|$|The British contributed {{the weakest}} force to Belgium. The BEF, {{under the command}} of General Lord Gort VC, {{consisted}} of just 152,000 men in two corps of two divisions each. It was hoped to field two armies of two Corps each, but this scale of mobilisation never took place. The I Corps was commanded by Lt-Gen. John Dill, later Lt-Gen. Michael Barker, who was in turn replaced by Major-General Harold Alexander. Lt-Gen. Alan Brooke commanded II Corps. Later the III Corps under Lt-Gen. Ronald <b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> added to the British order of battle. A further 9,392 Royal Air Force (RAF) personnel of the RAF Advanced Air Striking Force {{under the command of}} Air Vice-Marshal Patrick Playfair was to support operations in Belgium. By May 1940 the BEF had grown to 394,165 men, of whom more than 150,000 were part of the logistical rear area organisations and had little military training. On 10 May 1940, the BEF comprised just 10 divisions (not all at full strength), 1,280 artillery pieces and 310 tanks.|$|E
50|$|A famous case {{involving}} proxy murder {{was that of}} John Bodkin Adams. John Bodkin <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> an Irish physician who was investigated from 1946-1952 when 152 of his patients died mysteriously. Out of the 152, 130 of them mentioned Adams in their will, leaving him various amounts of money and items. <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> accused of having his assisting nurses give lethal doses of opiates. <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> arrested and tried for several counts of murder. He admitted to helping his nurses deliver morphine to patients, {{but he said it}} was to ease their passing, not to kill them. <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> acquitted for several of the murders, and many others were withdrawn because the cases were not strong enough to hold up in court. In the end, <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> convicted of fraud for lying on cremation papers.|$|R
50|$|In 1938 <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> {{summoned to}} Moscow, having been falsely denounced. Luckily enough, the falsified case against <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> closed and in 1939 he {{moved back to}} the U.S., {{creating}} his intelligence network anew.|$|R
