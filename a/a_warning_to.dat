For Christmas 2011, the BFI featured the complete 1970s films in their Mediatheque centres.|$|E

5|$|Germany invaded Poland in {{the early}} morning of 1 September 1939. The British Cabinet met late that morning and issued <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> <b>to</b> Germany that unless it withdrew from Polish {{territory}} Britain would carry out its obligations to Poland. When the House of Commons met at 6:00pm, Chamberlain and Labour deputy leader Arthur Greenwood (deputising for the sick Clement Attlee) entered the chamber to loud cheers. Chamberlain spoke emotionally, laying the blame for the conflict on Hitler.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> <b>to</b> the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group {{regarding}} HAACP (hazard {{analysis and}} critical control points) violations {{that were found}} at a processing plant in Irving, Texas. FDA found that lemon and lime juice was held in unsanitary conditions, which was a potential health threat to consumers. Company managers were advised by FDA that a reduction in microorganism levels was necessary to protect consumers.|$|E

Throughout her German passenger career, contemporary news accounts often reported on notable persons—typically actors, singers, and politicians—who sailed on George Washington.|$|E

5|$|The {{man holding}} up a sword is Hieronymus Jaroslaw Łaski, a diplomat and nephew of Archbishop Jan Łaski. Both men are shown {{to the right of}} the king, at the top of the crowd.

5|$|With a much-diminished {{group of}} followers, Catesby made a stand at Holbeche House in Staffordshire, against a 200-strong company of armed men. He {{was shot and}} later found dead, {{clutching}} {{a picture of the}} Virgin Mary. As <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> <b>to</b> others, his body was exhumed and subsequently decapitated, his head exhibited outside Parliament.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} two adaptations, both done by Clark, the tales were adapted {{by a number of}} playwrights and screenwriters. In most {{instances}} the adaptations alter the original source material. For example, <b>A</b> <b>Warning</b> <b>to</b> the Curious frequently deviates from its literary source. The screenplay avoids the convoluted plot structure of M. R. James's original, opting for a more linear construction and reducing the number of narrators. In addition the central character, Paxton, is changed from a young fair-haired innocent who stumbles across the treasure to a middle-aged character driven by poverty to seek the treasure and acting in full awareness of what he is doing.|$|E

5|$|As 9 Staffel {{crossed the}} coast they were fired at by Royal Navy patrol boats. The machine gun fire was ineffective. However, the Royal Observer Corps Post K3, {{situated}} {{on top of}} Beachy Head, spotted the Dorniers. They immediately telephoned <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> <b>to</b> Observer Group Headquarters at Horsham and fighter sector stations in the area, including RAF Kenley. Wing Commander Thomas Prickman, the station commander at Kenley, noticed the low-flying Dornier plot appear on his situation map. They appeared to be heading away towards the west, and was unsure of their target. His controllers were organising Nos. 64 and 615 Squadrons to meet the high-altitude raid. Roth headed past Lewes until {{he picked up the}} Brighton–London rail line. He then turned north-west.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth was {{regarded}} by her contemporaries as an efficient but ruthless politician who used political intrigues {{to protect and}} defend her daughters' rights. She was a caring parent, but was neither politically talented nor competent to prepare Mary and Hedwig for their roles as monarchs. Elizabeth failed to {{set a good example}} for her daughters, and her unbalanced character and questionable methods in politics would serve more as <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> <b>to</b> the young sovereigns. Her procrastinations and inability to make clear decisions threatened Hedwig's status, while her endless problems with Croatian nobles and failure to improve relations with her native Bosnia made Mary's reign insecure and tumultuous.|$|E
5|$|Hungarian troops {{suffered}} 126 {{dead and}} 241 wounded during the sporadic fighting, and killed between 1,122 and 3,500 civilians, including some Volksdeutsche. Many civilians {{were arrested and}} tortured. On 14 April 1941, around 500 Jews and Serbs were bayoneted to death, probably as <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> <b>to</b> others not to resist. During post-war questioning, Horthy insisted {{that he had not}} wished to invade Yugoslavia, but that he had been compelled to act by disorder and the massacre of Hungarians in Bačka, but these claims have been dismissed by Tomasevich.|$|E

5|$|Lanthanum-140 has a short {{half-life}} of some 41 hours, {{and is not}} {{a threat}} after a fairly short time. Other radioisotopes, present as impurities, have a long enough half-life to present a potential problem even decades after the tests; in 2002 the Los Alamos National Laboratory issued <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> <b>to</b> the Los Alamos county and the Forest Service performing thinning of trees in the area to not remove the trees cut {{in various parts of the}} Bayo Canyon due to possible content of residual radioactive materials. The worst affected zones are fenced off; detectable levels of radioisotopes are present in the soil, insects and trees in the surrounding areas. The neighbouring population was not informed about the tests until the mid-1990s, and Los Alamos refused to declassify the documentation.|$|E
5|$|Lotus' {{synthetic}} {{sound system}} was {{incorporated in the}} Lotus Evora 414E Hybrid, a concept plug-in hybrid unveiled at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. The system, called HALOsonic Internal and External Electronic Sound Synthesis, is a suite of noise solutions that uses patented technologies from Lotus and Harman International. The audio system generates engine sounds inside the vehicle through the audio system. The system also generates the external sound through speakers mounted at {{the front and rear}} to provide <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> <b>to</b> increase pedestrian safety. The system comes with four driver-selectable engine sounds, two of which have been designed to have characteristics of a multi-cylinder conventional V6 and V12 engine.|$|E
5|$|No tells Bond that he {{is working}} with the Russians and has built an {{elaborate}} underground facility from which he can sabotage US test missiles launched from Cape Canaveral. He had previously been a member of a Chinese tong, but after he stole a large amount of money from their treasury, he was captured by the organisation. The tong's leaders had No's hands cut off as <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> <b>to</b> others, and then shot. Because No's heart was {{on the right side of}} his body, the bullet missed it and he survived.|$|E

5|$|On September 14, 1951, PFC Edward Gomez (1932–1951), an Ammunition Bearer in Company E, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, 1st Marine Division, voluntarily {{moved down}} an {{abandoned}} trench {{to search for}} a new location for his machine gun and, when a hostile grenade landed between himself and his weapon, he shouted <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> <b>to</b> those around him as he grasped the activated charge in his hand. Determined to save his comrades, he unhesitatingly chose to sacrifice himself and, diving into a ditch with the deadly missile, absorbed the violence of the explosion in his own body.|$|E
5|$|Santa Anna {{ordered that}} the Tejano {{civilian}} survivors {{be allowed to}} return to their homes in San Antonio. Dickinson and Joe were allowed to travel towards the Anglo settlements, escorted by Ben, a former slave from the United States who served as Mexican Colonel Juan Almonte's cook. Each woman was given $2 and a blanket and was allowed to go free and spread the news of the destruction that awaited those who opposed the Mexican government. Before releasing Joe, Santa Anna ordered that the surviving members of the Mexican Army parade in a grand review, in the hopes that Joe and Dickinson would deliver <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> <b>to</b> the remainder of the Texian forces that his army was unbeatable.|$|E
5|$|Terns {{have a wide}} {{repertoire}} of vocalisations. For example, the common tern has a distinctive alarm, kee-yah, also used as <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> <b>to</b> intruders, and a shorter kyar, given as an individual takes flight {{in response to a}} more serious threat; this quietens the usually noisy colony while its residents assess the danger. Other calls include a down-slurred keeur given when an adult is approaching the nest with a fish, and a kip uttered during social contact. Parents and chicks can locate one another by call, and siblings also recognise each other's vocalisations from about the twelfth day after hatching, which helps to keep the brood together.|$|E
50|$|The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) is an XML-based {{data format}} for exchanging public {{warnings}} and emergencies between alerting technologies.

CAP increases warning effectiveness and simplifies {{the task of}} activating <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> for responsible officials.|$|R
