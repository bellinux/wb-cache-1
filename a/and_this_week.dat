500|$|The Mercedes storyline {{attracted}} criticism. Fallon took offence at Glee sole overweight black character {{turning into}} a [...] "fried potato-addicted junkie", and both Berk and Stack commented that while they had hoped for Mercedes to receive a major storyline, {{they did not want}} it to be centered on her weight issues. Semigran called it [...] "rather disposable" [...] but appreciated the [...] "silliness and levity" [...] it introduced, and Respers France noted that she did not mind the storyline itself, but disliked Kurt lecturing his supposed best friend. VanDerWerff felt that the Tots plot was [...] "one element too many" [...] in {{what could have been a}} [...] "pretty potent emotional storyline", but praised the performances by Colfer and Riley. Stack appreciated their dinner with Blaine, finding it representative of what he enjoys about the show, commenting: [...] "Last week, Kurt's sexuality was the central emotional storyline of the episode, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> it was played for laughs. Kurt's character has to walk that fine line between being a role model and becoming too saintly. I think the writers are navigating that tightrope quite, quite well." ...|$|E

500|$|Television {{critics were}} more {{favorable}} than {{not in their}} response to [...] "Mash Off". Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone felt that the series returned to form in the episode, and commented: [...] "We've said it before and we'll say it again: we like our Glee with just enough ridiculousness, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> had it." [...] Entertainment Weekly journalist Abby West noted that she loved {{the fact that it}} [...] "was a bullying episode that snuck up on us". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal opined that [...] "Mash Off" [...] {{was one of the best}} installments of Glee, and cited the episode's storylines as highlights: [...] "The mash-up episodes every season can be hit or miss, but this year was perfected to the nth degree." [...] Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times wrote that there was plenty of [...] "airy fun to be found" [...] in [...] "Mash Off", but added that [...] "underneath all the silly fake mustaches and snappy quotes about root-beer fountains and robot teachers beat a very dark baboon heart. In the end, that murky, telltale undercurrent burst to the fore, like a ... slap in the face, leaving us gasping and a little confused." [...] Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson stated that it was [...] "surprisingly good", and that [...] "Mash Off" [...] was a [...] "solid hour of television that was bursting with fantastic musical numbers and some really gratifying narrative developments". Michael Slezak of TV Line said that the episode contributed to a revitalization of the quality of the show's third season.|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] was premiered in MSN Spain on January 1, 2011. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News said, [...] "There {{comes a time}} in every pop princess' career when she must throw a sexy dance party and {{proclaim}} her womanhood. Back in 2001 Britney Spears did as much in 'I'm a Slave 4 U,' <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> Miley Cyrus {{is doing the same}} in the video for her club-ready track 'Who Owns My Heart.'" [...] Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly assumed the theme of the video were the divergent hairstyles, but acclaimed the video for its fun. [...] Stransky said the sultry aspect of the video added to its frothy, [...] "thumpa-thumpa deliciousness". Edith Zimmerman of New York magazine viewed it as [...] "awkward". Megan Vick of Billboard thought the video followed the same steps as the video for [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] — dark lighting, lots of bare Cyrus parts and writhing around on flat surfaces. Vick recalled Amy Winehouse's [...] "Rehab" [...] video when seeing the bathroom scene and viewed the ending as a relief. Tim Winter, president of the Parents Television Council, criticized the video for its suggestiveness and sexual elements. Winter continued, [...] "It is unfortunate that she would participate in such a sexualized video like this one. It sends messages to her fanbase that are diametrically opposed to everything she has done up to this point. Miley built her fame and fortune entirely on the backs of young girls, and it saddens us that she seems so eager to distance herself from that fanbase so rapidly." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Am the Walrus" [...] was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews from critics. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review. In his review for the episode, he opined: [...] "The episode itself didn't disappoint either, as [...] this was a quality half-hour of jokes. Kaiser praised the argument between Stan and Steve, calling it a [...] "superb sequence". Concluding his review, Kaiser went on to write, [...] "Despite all the absurdity, the episode even manages to successfully come around to an emotional resolution when Stan, realizing that Steve is an utter failure at attempted mating, resolves to see Steve as a son instead of potential masculine competition. Then [...] there's a rape joke. But, it being American Dad, it's actually a surprisingly funny rape joke." [...] He went on to give the episode an [...] "A-", scoring higher than The Simpsons episode [...] "Love Is a Many Strangled Thing", but scoring lower than Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Spaghetti Western and Meatballs". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also reacted positively, writing, [...] "It was good to have American Dad back in the lineup. Roger was in fine form, and I can at least appreciate that they're {{trying to figure out}} how to make Hayley and Jeff work in the family dynamic. They never quite got there with Hayley alone, so maybe things will work better this way." [...] However, he was more critical on the sub-plot. In his review for the episode, Hughes opined: [...] "The B-story left me wanting. The writers are still trying to figure out the new dynamic of having Hayley married and Jeff living in the house with the Smiths. The whole thing has been barely addressed, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> we got a fairly weak exploration of them having fairly standard marital problems." ...|$|E

He furthermore took occasion to apologize for any negligence that might be perceptible in his dress, {{on the ground that}} last night he had had 'the sun very strong in his eyes'; by which expression he was understood to convey to his hearers in the most delicate manner possible, the information that he had been extremely drunk.|$|E

And such a man, {{before he}} shuts himself up, {{and begins to}} examine himself, {{would do well to}} examine himself as to why he is going to examine himself, and to ask, Why am I going to do this?

But, if so; have I the mind of Christ? For he did not think of his own interest, his own gain, his own pleasure, his own glory. How is this, then? I confess that the root of all my faults is selfishness. Shall I examine into my own selfishness for a selfish end--to get safety and pleasure by it hereafter? I confess that the very glory of Christ is, that there is no selfishness in him. Shall I think over the sufferings of the unselfish Christ for a selfish end--to get something by it after I die? I am too apt already to make myself the centre, round which all the world must turn: to care for everything only as far as it does me good or harm. Shall I make myself the centre round which heaven is to turn? Shall I think of God and of Christ only as far as it will profit me? <b>And</b> <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> too, of all weeks in the year?

60|$|Your so {{liberal and}} graceful letter is {{to my head}} like coals of fire--so {{repeatedly}} for all these weeks have I had feebly to suffer frustrations {{in the matter of}} trundling over the marsh to ask for your news and wish for your continued amendment. The shortening days and the deepening mud have been at the bottom of this affair. I never {{get out of the house}} till 3 o'clock, when night is quickly at one's heels. I would have taken a regular day--I mean started in the a.m.--but have been so ridden, myself, by the black care of an unfinished and running (galloping, leaping and bounding,) serial that parting with a day has been like parting with a pound of flesh. I am still a neck ahead, however, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> will see me through; I accordingly hope very much to be able to turn up on one of the ensuing days. I will sound a horn, so that you yourself be not absent on the chase. Then I will express more articulately my appreciation of your various signs of critical interest, as well as assure you of my sympathy in your own martyrdom. What will you have? It's all a grind and a bloody battle--as well as a considerable lark, and the difficulty itself is the refuge from the vulgarity. Bless your heart, I think I could easily say worse of the T. of the S., the young woman, the spooks, the style, the everything, than the worst any one else could manage. One knows the most damning things about one's self. Of course I had, about my young woman, to take a very sharp line. The grotesque business I had to make her picture and the childish psychology I had to make her trace and present, were, for me at least, a very difficult job, in which absolute lucidity and logic, a singleness of effect, were imperative. Therefore I had to rule out subjective complications of her own--play of tone etc.; and keep her impersonal save for the most obvious and indispensable little note of neatness, firmness and courage--without which she wouldn't have had her data. But the thing is essentially a pot-boiler and a jeu d'esprit.|$|E
