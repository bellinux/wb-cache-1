50|$|Antimutagens can be {{classified}} into: Desmutagens, that inactivate the chemical interactions before the mutagen attacks the genes and Bio-antimutagens, that stop the mutation process once after the genes are damaged by mutagens. There {{are a number of}} naturally occurring <b>anti-mutagens</b> that show their efficient action.|$|E
40|$|In {{experiments}} using yeast {{without an}} external metabolic activation system, the hormones testosterone, beta-estradiol and diethylstilbistrol were anti-mutagenic and co-recombinogenic. In {{the presence of}} Aroclor-induced rat liver S- 9 plus cofactors (S 9 -mix) the same substances acted as co-mutagens and anti-recombinogens. Since an external metabolic activation system was able to convert <b>anti-mutagens</b> into co-mutagens, we studied whether the different metabolism of yeast and mice would lead to different effects. In whole-animal experiments using the mouse spot test, anti-mutagenic effects of vanillin ( [...] .), phenobarbital ( [...] .), and tannic acid ( [...] .) have been observed. In our present experiments with yeast, tannic acid and phenobarbital showed anti-mutagenic effects also, whereas vanillin acted as a co-mutagen. Thus, {{as in the case}} of the hormones, tannic acid and phenobarbital were anti-mutagenic and co-recombinogenic whereas vanillin was co-mutagenic as well as co-recombinogenic...|$|E
40|$|Vitti {{and colleagues}} (2003) have {{discussed}} iodine deficiency in Europe and have launched programs {{to eradicate the}} malady. The problem still remains worldwide, however, as stressed by WHO (2001). A clue to how it may be overcome {{is provided by the}} finding by Koutras et al (2003) that iodine deficiency is no longer a problem in Greece due to improvement in socioeconomic and nutritional conditions, and increased use of produced foods. We here would like to propose the consumption of seaweeds not only as a good source of iodine but also from the overall nutritional perspective. There are few people suffering from iodine deficiency in Japan because people often consume seaweeds (or kelp) in addition to fish, chicken eggs, milk, and dairy products (Health Promotion and Nutrition Division, 2003; Tokudome et al., 2002). Seaweeds are particularly rich in iodine, at 100 - 1, 000 times the level in fish. For example, kombu, a typical and commonly consumed seaweed, contains more than 100, 000 µg of iodine/ 100 g, while sardine and horse mackerel, as examples of fish with the highest iodine concentrations, feature only approximately 250 µg of iodine/ 100 g (Science and Technology Agency, Japan, 2001). Japanese chicken eggs are also rich in iodine because chickens receive bone meal and shells as a supplementation for minerals, including calcium, in particular. Seaweeds also contain vitamins and dietary fiber (Science and Technology Agency, Japan, 2001). Important minerals in seaweeds other than iodine are calcium and iron. Vitamins include vitamin B complex, folic acid and carotenoids including α- and ß-carotenes, chlorophyll, and fucoxanthin, which act as <b>anti-mutagens</b> or anti-oxidant...|$|E
50|$|The GCES demands {{disclosure}} {{and uses the}} opportunity to ask about Morn Hyland, a UMCP ensign they apparently abandoned to pirates and the Amnion. Warden and Hashi offer half-truths to the Council, telling them that they failed to recapture Angus and Milos, and that they arranged for Morn {{to be given to}} Nick as 'payment' for a job they had him do so that she {{could be used as a}} bargaining chip should Nick's mission at Billingate fail. The mission was to give a non-working <b>anti-mutagen</b> drug in hopes that it would disrupt Billingate's usefulness to the Amnion, not letting on that they gave him a working <b>anti-mutagen</b> drug that the UMCP suppressed years previous.|$|R
5000|$|The episodes [...] "The Battle of New York" [...] (season 3) {{reveal that}} the Kraang {{actually}} possess several Technodromes, one of which the Turtles commandeer in order to rescue the abducted populace of New York. The Technodromes are powered by Kraang mutagen, which the Turtles convert into <b>anti-mutagen</b> in order to cure the humans of their mutations before returning them home. In [...] "Annihilation Earth!" [...] (season 3) the first Technodrome used to invade Earth is made operational again and rises from the sea off the New York coast, only to be attacked and destroyed by the arriving Triceratons.|$|R
50|$|As {{the final}} {{showdown}} commenced at the club, Leo and Raph were fending off Rahzar and Tokka's snapping attacks. Dr. Perry informed Donatello that their repeated burping was slowing down what little <b>anti-mutagen</b> they had ingested and that carbon dioxide {{was needed to}} speed up the demutation. The Turtles knocked their foes off their feet and flat on their backs with a couple of barrels they found somewhere in the concert, and then the turtles shoved fire extinguishers into the creature's mouths, which administered the needed carbon dioxide to reverse the mutation. Finally, the antidote took effect and the two mutants returned to their normal animal forms. What happened to them after this is unknown, though it is most likely that they could've been sent back to the Bronx Zoo.|$|R
5000|$|During {{their second}} {{encounter}} at the construction site, amidst a distraction, Leonardo and Michaelangelo trick Tokka and Rahzar into eating the antidote (they froze the concoction into ice cubes and then hid {{them in a}} box of donuts, which they then offered to the two mutants as the [...] "ritual of the traditional pre-fight donut"). Rahzar and Tokka devoured some of the donuts with continued coaxing from the Turtles. Surprisingly, Rahzar, regardless of his infant-like mentality, figured {{that something was wrong}} with the situation, and crushed one of the donuts in his claw, discovering the <b>anti-mutagen</b> cube hidden inside. Enraged at what they assumed was an attempt to poison them, Tokka and Rahzar attacked the Turtles with Rahzar grabbing Michaelangelo by the hands and spinning him around before smashing him through a wall and into the Dockshore Club, interrupting a crowded dance concert by Vanilla Ice.|$|R
50|$|As {{luck would}} have it Vector Shaheed was one of the lead {{scientists}} working on an <b>anti-mutagen</b> drug. The Amnion, the beings that inhabit Forbidden Space, would have their mutagens turn the entire human race into Amnion themselves, and the immunity drug that Vector was working on would have assured humanity their safety. The UCMP took Shaheed’s research away from him and suppressed the drug on Holt Farsner’s orders. Hashi Lebwohl secretly finished Shaheed’s research and gave a sample of the drug to Nick Succorso to test. With samples of the drug in their possession, the crew of Trumpet decide to have Vector complete his research at an illegal lab run by a man named Deaner Beckmann. It is hoped, assuming Vector can complete his research, that the drug can be disseminated to the rest of humanity to protect them should the Amnion invade human space. On their way into human space Angus’ programming has him send a message using a listening post to UMCPHQ coded for Warden Dios, the director of the UMCP itself. After sending the message Trumpet speeds off toward the Valdor Industrial system where the lab is located deep within an asteroid swarm orbiting a binary star.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{their low}} intelligence, the two mutant's {{incredible}} physical strength {{made them more}} than a match for the Turtles. On their first encounter at Shredder and Tatsu's junkyard base, the Turtles were ill-prepared and barely managed to escape when trying to save their brother Raphael from capture and rescue Dr. Perry. During the escape they trapped Tokka in a manhole from the waist down. Michaelangelo teased Tokka and tickled {{the bottom of the}} snapper's clawed feet. Later that night, Shredder let them loose in the city, telling to 'go play', which they did by tipping over cars, knocking down telephone poles, and trashing buildings. After doing a report on the devastation the next day, April O'Neil was confronted by the Foot with a message for the Turtles: If they didn't meet the Foot at a construction site near the docks that night, Shredder would set Tokka and Rahzar out again into Central Park. As many people would get hurt, the Turtles and Splinter agreed that there was no other choice but to face Shredder, regardless of their disadvantage against Tokka and Rahzar's immense strength. However, the professor had a plan; with the help of Donatello and Keno and using the contamination is the ooze that mutated Tokka and Rahzar as a basis, Dr. Perry prepared an <b>anti-mutagen</b> to de-mutate them, which had to be ingested.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{threat of}} the Amnion is their {{mutagenic}} technology. Mutagens {{have the ability to}} rewrite the DNA of a non-Amnioni so it becomes at least partially Amnion. This ability was first discovered by humans during tests on the material discovered in the Amnion satellite - Donaldson remarks that [...] "Earth science being what it was... the tests eventually included feeding a bit of the substance to a rat." [...] This has a drastic effect on the rat, which now resembles [...] "a mobile clump of seaweed". Dissection reveals a fundamental genetic change - basic life processes remain intact, but protein and DNA structure are radically different. The new mutants can breed with each other (though not with mutated members of other species) and, most disturbingly, display a significantly increased level of intelligence. When the mutagen was tested on a human being, she only survived for {{a day and a half}} - autopsies cite the only possible cause of death as fright. Later in the series the trauma of mutation into an Amnioni is mentioned - this is probably what killed her. Before her death she wrote down galactic co-ordinates, which is where the Deep Star found the Solidarity. An <b>anti-mutagen</b> drug is developed by Intertech, but one of the many storylines in the series is the suppression of the drug and all research relating to it by the United Mining Companies Police, and why this was done.|$|R
30|$|Caffeic acid (CA, 3, 4 -dihydroxycinnamic acid), {{a kind of}} {{phenolic}} compound and the major hydroxycinnamic acid presented in human diet, is found in feverfew, coffee beans, teas, wines, and quite a few fruits [9]. CA is important in protecting the cells from induction of cell apoptosis, treating the therapy of leucopenia and thrombocytopenia in clinical diagnosis, and inhibiting the activity of phosphodiesterase (the major ingredient of snake venom) [10]. Furthermore, as the antioxidant, CA has been widely used in cosmetics, hair dyes, antibacterial agent, and <b>anti-mutagen.</b> Accordingly, it is vitally important to quantitatively detect CA in clinic, research, and the daily life. In the last few years, many techniques {{have been developed to}} detect CA. For instance, Cai et al. designed a fluorometric assay platform for fluorescence detection of CA [11], Khezeli et al. detected the CA by a green ultrasonic-assisted liquid–liquid microextraction based on deep eutectic solvent [12], Konar et al. measured the CA by supercritical fluid extraction [13], and Liu et al. detected the CA by electrochemical method with synthesized nanocomposite [14]. Among them, electrochemical detection has gained the most attention due to its stability, sensitivity, and fast response. A majority of reports are focused on carbon material-based nanocomposites, such as graphene-based Au nanoparticles and PEDOT (Au–PEDOT/RGO) [14], MnO 2 -embedded flower-like hierarchical porous carbon microspheres (MnO 2 /CM) [15], and gold/palladium nanoparticles decorated graphene flakes (Au/PdNPs-GRF) [10]. Compared with carbon-based system, Pt-based ones are expected to have even higher electrocatalytic sensitivity, but due to the abovementioned issues, it is seldom used toward CA sensing.|$|R
40|$|Objective. Curcuma longa (C. longa) {{was used}} in some {{countries}} such as China and India for various medicinal purposes. Curcumin, the active component of C. longa, is commonly used as a coloring agent in foods, drugs, and cosmetics. C. longa and curcumin {{have been known to}} act as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, <b>anti-mutagen,</b> and anti-carcinogenic agents. Th e attempt of the present review was to give an effort on a detailed literature survey concentrated on the protective effects of C. longa and curcumin on the reproductive organs activity. Methods. The databases such as, PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Iran- Medex, were considered. The search terms were “testis” or “ovary” and “Curcuma longa”, “curcumin”, “antioxidant effect”, “anti-inflammatory effect” and “anti-cancer effect”. Results. C. longa and curcumin inhibited the production of the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and increased the caspases (3, 8 and 9) activities in HL- 60 prostate cancer. Furthermore, C. longa and curcumin suppressed the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), phosphorylated signal transducers and activators of the transcription 3 (STAT) and matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) in ovarian cancer cell line. Conclusion. C. longa and curcumin might decrease the risk of cancer and other malignant diseases in the reproductive system. C. longa and curcumin have a protective effect on the reproductive organs activity such as, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant effects in normal cells but showed pro-apoptotic effects in the malignant cells. Therefore, different effects of C. longa and curcumin are dependent on the doses and the type of cells used in various models studied...|$|R
40|$|Chemically, {{resveratrol}} is {{a substance}} of a polyphenolic character {{from the group}} of phytoalexins - 3, 5, 4 ´- trihydroxystilbene - and exists in cis and trans-isomer forms. In natural sources trans-isomer is more common. As a natural polyphenolic substance, it shows {{a whole range of}} biological activities, such as anti-oxidizing and anti-microbial features (namely anti-fungal activities), the ability to absorb free radicals, affects blood sedimentation rate etc. Recently, trans-resveratrol has also been attributed <b>anti-mutagen</b> and chemo-protective features against cancer proliferation. It is assumed that resveratrol {{could be one of the}} active substances contributing to the health benefits, namely it decreases the risk of cardiovascular diseases through a reasonable consumption of red wine. Grapes of Vitis vinifera and especially red wine represent its main source in human diet. Grape peels contain about 0. 5 to 2. 0 mg of resveratrol/g of dry weight and the average concentration in red wines of world provenience fluctuates between 1. 0 and 3. 0 mg/l. Resveratrol was determined by HPLC method with electrochemical detection after direct injection of wine or plant extracts. As expected, red wines from vines originating in the Bohemian and Moravian vineyard regions appeared to contain relatively high levels of resveratrol (from 1. 3 to 15. 4 mg/l) and trans/cis ratio ranged from 0. 5 to 4. 8, excess of cis-resveratrol to trans-isomer was typical for red wine growing in Most region (northern Bohemia) where vineyards are exposed to higher environmental stress due to frequent air pollutions in this area. In addition, resveratrol determined in different parts of grapevine (leaves, rachis) varied from 6 to 490 mg/kg of the dry matter. Cluster stems were found as the richest source of resveratrol...|$|R
40|$|The {{stilbene}} resveratrol is {{a stress}} metabolite produced by Vitis vinifera grapevines during fungal infection, wounding or UV radiation. Resveratrol is synthesised {{particularly in the}} skins of grape berries and only trace amounts {{are present in the}} fruit flesh. Red wine contains a much higher resveratrol concentration than white wine, due to skin contact during fermentation. Apart from its antifungal characteristics, resveratrol has also been shown to have cancer chemopreventive activity and {{to reduce the risk of}} coronary heart disease. It acts as an antioxidant and <b>anti-mutagen</b> and has the ability to induce specific enzymes that metabolise carcinogenic substances. The objective of this pilot study was to investigate the feasibility of developing wine yeasts with the ability to produce resveratrol during fermentation in both red and white wines, thereby increasing the wholesomeness of the product. To achieve this goal, the phenylpropanoid pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae would have to be introduced to produce p-coumaroyl-CoA, one of the substrates required for resveratrol synthesis. The other substrate for resveratrol synthase, malonyl-CoA, is already found in yeast and is involved in de novo fatty-acid biosynthesis. We hypothesised that production of p-coumaroyl-CoA and resveratrol can be achieved by co-expressing the coenzyme-A ligase-encoding gene (4 CL 216) from a hybrid poplar and the grapevine resveratrol synthase gene (vst 1) in laboratory strains of S. cerevisiae. This yeast has the ability to metabolise p-coumaric acid, a substance already present in grape must. This compound was therefore added to the synthetic media used for the growth of laboratory cultures. Transformants expressing both the 4 CL 216 and vst 1 genes were obtained and tested for production of resveratrol. Following ?-glucosidase treatment of organic extracts for removal of glucose moieties that are typically bound to resveratrol, the results showed that the yeast transformants had produced the resveratrol β-glucoside, piceid. This is the first report of the reconstruction of a biochemical pathway in a heterologous host to produce resveratrol. 7 page(s...|$|R
