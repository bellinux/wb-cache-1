Tak-ing the viewpoint distribution as input and object mesh polygons as output vectors, the channel is given by the projected areas of the polygons over the different view-points. From this channel, viewpoint entropy and viewpoint mutual information can be defined in a natural way. Reversing this channel, polygonal mutual information is obtained, which is interpreted as an <b>ambient</b> occlusion-like <b>quantity,</b> and from the variation of this polygonal mutual information mesh saliency is defined. Viewpoint entropy, viewpoint Kullback-Leibler distance, and viewpoint mutual information are then applied to mesh simplification, and shown to compare well with a classical geometrical simplification method. ...|$|R

Although, the majority of warming experiments have increased day and night temperatures equally, {{there is evidence of}} greater increase in global minimum temperatures compared to midday maxima, resulting in an altered mean diurnal temperature range (DTR).

We assessed the response of SOC to a mean temperature increase of 3. 5 °C with three temperature treatments: symmetric (SYM) warming of + 3. 5 °C, asymmetric (ASYM) warming of + 5 °C/ + 2 °C at minimum and maximum daily temperature, respectively, and control treatments that were kept at <b>ambient</b> (<b>AMB)</b> temperatures.

We hypothesized that above- and below-ground biomass, gross primary productivity (GPP), AMF root colonization and nutrient acquisition would increase {{in response to the}} future climate conditions. Furthermore, we expected that increased below-ground C allocation would enhance soil respiration (R soil). Methods: Grassland communities were grown either at ambient temperatures with 375 ppm CO 2 (<b>Amb)</b> or at <b>ambient</b> temperatures + 3 °C with 620 ppm CO 2 (T+CO 2). Results: Total biomass production and GPP were stimulated under T+CO 2. Above-ground biomass was increased under T+CO 2 while belowground biomass was similar under both climates. The significant increase in root colonization intensity under T+CO 2, and therefore the better contact between roots and AMF, probably determined the higher above-ground P and N content. R soil was not significantly affected by the future climate conditions, only showing a tendency to increase under future climate {{at the end of the}} season. Conclusions: Newly established grasslands benefited from the exposure to elevated CO 2 and temperature in terms of total biomass production; higher root AMF colonization may partly provide the nutrients required to sustain this growth response. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|The {{monitoring}} of ambient doses at work places around high-energy accelerators is a challenging task due {{the complexity of}} the mixed stray radiation fields encountered. At CERN, mainly Centronics IG 5 high-pressure ionisation chambers are used to monitor radiation exposure in mixed fields. The monitors are calibrated in the operational <b>quantity</b> <b>ambient</b> dose equivalent H*(10) using standard, source-generated photon- and neutron fields. However, the relationship between ionisation chamber reading and ambient dose equivalent in a mixed high-energy radiation field can only be assessed if the spectral response to every component and the field composition is known. Therefore, comprehensive studies were performed at the CERN-EU high-energy reference field facility where the spectral fluence for each particle type has been assessed with Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, studies have been performed in an accessible controlled radiation area in the vicinity of a beam loss point of CERN's proton synchrotron. The comparison of measurements and calculations has shown reasonable agreement for most exposure conditions. The results indicate that conventionally calibrated ionisation chambers can give satisfactory response in terms of ambient dose equivalent in stray radiation fields at high-energy accelerators in many cases.

40|$|The {{characterization}} {{and measurement}} of the spatial, temporal and energy emission of air-scattered photons, electrons and neutrons generated near 10 MV or greater accelerator-based bremsstrahlung photon sources is becoming important in many applications. The national and homeland security research community is interested in developing technologies which can detect illicit materials at substantial standoff distances in outdoor environments. These systems {{are referred to as}} "active" interrogation systems and are defined as inspection systems that take advantage of an externally applied "source" to perform traditional imaging of, or to stimulate characteristic emissions from, an inspected object. A key concern in the development of these systems is the ability to effectively predict the dose equivalents at long standoff distances from these sources in order to ascertain the operational radiation safety of said systems. Current computational radiation transport simulation tools have the ability to effectively model these systems; however, a paucity of experimental data exists in comparing the results of these simulations. A methodology to assess the radiation dose surrounding a high-energy bremsstrahlung-based accelerator system for national defense applications was developed. Fluence-to-dose conversion coefficients for the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements operational <b>quantity</b> <b>ambient</b> dose equivalent were calculated for photons and electrons up to 25 MeV utilizing the Los Alamos National Laboratory Monte Carlo N-Particle code, MCNP 5 Version 1. 51.

An extensive set of system simulations was performed to model a prototype high-energy bremsstrahlung-based accelerator system to obtain photon, electron and neutron fluence spectra. These fluence data were folded with the calculated ambient dose equivalent conversion coefficients as well as previously published effective dose conversion coefficients. A set of integral air-scatter measurements for accelerator-generated primary and secondary radiations (photon and neutron) were performed around the prototype system in order to provide a comparative data set from which to determine the total dose equivalent both in the beam (on-axis) and outside of the beam (off-axis).

40|$|Insight {{of thermal}} {{behaviour}} of lithium-ion batteries under various operating conditions {{is crucial for}} the development of battery management system (BMS). Although battery thermal behaviour has been studied by published models, the reported modelling normally addresses either normal operation or thermal runaway condition. A comprehensive electro-thermal model which can capture heat generation, voltage and current variation during the whole process from normal cycling to thermal runaway should be of benefit for BMS by evaluating critical factors influencing potential transition to thermal runaway and investigating the evolution process under different cooling and environment conditions. In this study, such a three-dimensional model has been developed within the frame of open source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code OpenFOAM to study the electrical and thermal behaviour of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The equations governing the electric conduction are coupled with heat transfer and energy balance within the cell. Published and new laboratory data for LiNi 0. 33 Co 0. 33 Mn 0. 33 O 2 /Li 1. 33 Ti 1. 67 O 4 (LNCMO/LTO) cells from normal cycling to thermal runaway have been used to provide input parameters as well as model validation. The model has well captured the evolution process of a cell from normal cycling to abnormal behaviour until thermal runaway and achieved reasonably good agreement with the measurements. The validated model has then been used to conduct parametric studies of this particular type of LIB by evaluating the effects of discharging current rates, airflow <b>quantities,</b> <b>ambient</b> temperatures and thickness of airflow channel on the response of the cell. Faster function losses, earlier thermal runaway and higher extreme temperatures were found when cells were discharged under higher current rates. The airflow with specific velocity was found to provide effective mitigation against over-heating when the ambient temperature was below 370 K but less effective when the ambient temperature was higher than the critical value of 425 K. The thickness of airflow channel was also found to have critical influence on the cell tolerance to elevated temperatures. These parametric studies demonstrate that the model can be used to predict potential LIB transition to thermal runaway under various conditions and aid BMS...|$|R

Air quality is being affected adversely due to several reasons such as increasing number of industries without having proper emission handling systems and increasing number of vehicles. Many industrial stacks observed in Sri Lanka today are not constructed according to the proper stack design requirements. The quality of stack emissions or the dispersion of pollutants from a specific stack is seldom analyzed mainly because of the high costs involved. Even analysis is done on the dispersion from a specific stack it is difficult to get good representative results because the meteorological conditions vary frequently. In this study a stack emission dispersion model named AUSPLUME which is developed by the Victorian Environmental Protection Authority and recommended by several organizations for 'regulatory purpose was studied. This work mainly looks at the following: 1. The applicability of the model in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 11. Model emissions from the stacks at Holcim Lanka cement plant at Puttlam with the use of AUSPLUME before and after installing a new dust handling system The purpose of the EIA is to predict and identify potentially significant environmental impacts of development projects and to suggest mitigation measures to minimize the negative impacts and maximize the positive impacts. Main stages in the EIA process are, 1. Screening (find out whether an EIA is required) 11. Scoping (identification of main issues) lll. Collection and analysis of information IV. Public involvement v. Communicating the findings In the process of analyzing the information AUSPLUME can be used. With available information about the stack, emissions and the meteorological data of the area of concern, the model can predict the concentrations of selected constituents at ground level or elevated levels in the down wind direction. The areas of worst impact, limit of the buffer zone, effects to the high rise buildings or effects to the selected areas of important like high bio diversity, archeology, and residences can be identified using the results obtained with AUSPLUME. For the analysis of the stack emission dispersion from the Holcim Lanka cement plant at Puttlam, the meteorological data obtained at the Palavi weather monitoring station of the Meteorological Department were used. There are two similar stacks at the factory which are placed close by and therefore both of them were considered as a single point source with an equivalent diameter. The area was considered to be a flat terrain since there were no disturbances in the vicinity. The analysis results on the dispersion of particulate matter, NOz and SOz emissions from the stack were compared with <b>ambient</b> air <b>quantity</b> standards for Sri Lanka and European Guideline values which were established by considering human health hazards other than carcinogenity. Certain values were found to be above the limits and the rest below the limit. Anyway in this analysis raw emission data were used and in the real life the raw emissions are mixed with clean air before released to the atmosphere. Therefore due to the dilution the real values can be expected to be much lower. Predicted values were compared with field measurement values available and with predicted values from SCREEN 3 model. The results obtained can be used for decision making purposes with a good understanding about their inaccuracy...|$|R

40|$|Competitive {{industries}} in the manufacturing sector have a holistic Life Cycle Management (LCM) view of business practices. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which forms part of the LCM approach, is increasingly used as a decision support tool in the South African manufacturing industry. The Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) phase of the LCA tool has been standardised within the ISO 14000 family and aims to quantify {{the environmental impacts of}} economic activities. A number of LCIA methodologies have been developed in Europe, which can be applied directly when life cycle systems are assessed. The LCIA procedures that are most commonly used in the South African manufacturing industry include the CML, Ecopoints, EPS and Eco-indicators 95 and 99 procedures. The five European methods are evaluated based on the applicability of the respective classification, characterisation, normalisation and weighting elements for the South African situation. The evaluation and comparison is further based on a cradle-to-gate Screening Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA) case study of the production of dyed two-fold wool yarn in South Africa. Shortcomings are identified with the European methodologies in the South African context in terms of comprehensiveness and modelling approaches. A LCIA framework and calculation procedure, termed the Resource Impact Indicator (RII) model, is subsequently proposed for South Africa, which is based on the protection of four natural resource groups: water, air, land, and mined abiotic resources. A distance-to-target approach is used for the normalisation of midpoint categories, which focuses on the <b>ambient</b> quality and <b>quantity</b> objectives for the four resource groups. The quality and quantity objectives are determined for defined South African Life Cycle Assessment (SALCA) regions and take into account endpoint or damage targets. Following the precautionary approach, RIIs are calculated for the resource groups from conventional Life Cycle Inventories (LCIs). The calculation of the RIIs ensures that all natural resources that are important from a South African perspective are duly considered in a LCIA. The results of a LCIA are consequently not reliant on detailed LCIs and the number of midpoint categories that converge on a single resource group. The proposed model is evaluated with the SLCA wool case study. The case study establishes the importance of region-specificity, for LCIs and LCIAs. The proposed LCIA model further demonstrates reasonable ease of communication of LCIA results to decision-makers or managers. Subjective weighting values for the resource groups are also proposed, based on survey results from manufacturing industry sectors in the South African automotive value chain, and the expenditure of the South African national government on environmental issues. The subjective weighting values are used to calculate overall Environmental Performance Resource Impact Indicators (EPRIIs) when comparing life cycle systems with each other. The EPRII approach is applied to a specific LCM problem in the South African context, i. e. evaluating and comparing environmental performance for supply chain management purposes in the developing country context. Thereby, RIIs are provided for key Cleaner Production process parameters in the South Africa context: water usage, energy usage, and waste produced per manufactured product.
