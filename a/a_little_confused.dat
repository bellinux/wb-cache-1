500|$|In early February 2012, Rolo Tomassi {{announced}} {{the release of}} a new single: 'Old Mystics'. 'Old Mystics' and its B-side 'Mesmerizer' was written by synthesiser play James Spence in the earliest stages of the Astraea's writing, in late 2011. The single was uploaded to the band's Facebook profile to stream for free. They released the single on 26 March. The band announced a few days after releasing [...] "Old Mystics" [...] for streaming that it will most likely not appear on the new album and will just be a stand-alone single as they felt the two songs did not fit onto Astraea. Rolo Tomassi completed their first tour of the year as the main support for Architects on a 14-date UK tour in April. They used this tour to promote their new single 'Old Mystics' as well as debut other unrecorded new material from the album, such as songs 'Howl' and 'Remancer'. Rolo Tomassi's presence on the tour was met with positive reception; however, reviewers believed the band's music was too aggressive and chaotic for fans of Architects. Tim Sewell when writing for The Courier Online said that: [...] "it was apparent that much of the crowd (mostly Architects fans) were left <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>confused</b> by singer/shewolf Eva Spence, who flung herself about in front of them screaming." ...|$|E

50|$|While Capra {{concentrates}} {{his discussion}} on living things, {{the idea behind}} the concept of structure-organization-process {{is one in which}} a process self organizes own structure (autopoieses as defined by Maturana and Varela, 1987). As we can see, the definitions for these three elements are <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>confusing.</b> This is why the idea of structure-organization-process (SOP) has been applied more generally by Linda Glassop (2007).|$|R
6000|$|The almost {{universal}} habit of batsmen of shouting [...] "Heads!" [...] at whatever height {{from the ground}} the ball may be, is not <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>confusing.</b> The average person, on hearing the shout, puts {{his hands over his}} skull, crouches down and trusts to luck. This is an excellent plan if the ball is falling, but is not much protection against a skimming drive along the ground.|$|R

5000|$|The series bears {{repeated}} listening, {{with many}} subtle lines, {{but at times}} can be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>confusing</b> as it goes backwards and forwards in time, segued by records that they play on their show.

One typical line from Bain-Jones is [...] "... {{and i said no}} it won't as its water based...", before realising they are on air again.|$|R

5000|$|In Paul's {{second letter}} to the Corinthians, he again refers to himself as an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God and reassures the people of Corinth {{that they will not}} have another painful visit, but {{what he has to say}} is not to cause pain but to reassure them of the love he has for them. It is shorter in length in {{comparison}} to the first and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>confusing</b> if the reader is unaware of the social, religious, and economic situation of the community. Paul felt the situation in Corinth was still complicated and felt attacked.|$|R

30|$|Figure  1 a {{shows that}} 2 D fast {{reconnection}} process generates a 2 D plasmoid at T= 72, where the B_y contour map is almost uniform in z-direction, i.e., the sheet current direction. Note that the z-directional black wide bands around x= 0 and x= 30 may be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>confusing,</b> where <b>a</b> lot of contour lines are highly condensed. Indeed, the black wide band around x= 0 is colored by blue {{and the black}} wide band around x= 30 is colored by red. Also, the magnetic field lines are almost the same between at z= 0 and L_z. Hence, the fast reconnection process is 2 D at this time.|$|R
60|$|A son has {{the right}} to inherit his father's land on the father's assessment, so long as its term runs, or, when the term has expired, has a prior claim as against any one else. Part of the taxes, it is said, lies by in the local prefecture's office as a reserve fund against inundations. Yet, and this seems <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>confusing,</b> there are between five and seven other local, provincial, and {{municipal}} taxes which can reasonably be applied to the same ends. No one of these taxes exceeds a half of the land-tax, unless it be the local prefecture tax of 2-1/2 per cent.|$|R
40|$|Limb {{exsanguination}} before tourniquet {{inflation is}} usually accomplished using mechanical devices although, where their use is contraindicated, exsanguination by elevation alone may be employed. Advice regarding duration of elevation {{within the literature}} is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>confusing</b> with recommendations ranging from 20 s to 5 min. Volume changes, during elevation at 45 degrees and 90 degrees, were measured using strain gauge plethysmography in seven male volunteers. In addition, the superimposed effect of brachial arterial compression on elevation at 90 degrees was investigated. To achieve maximal exsanguination {{it is recommended that}} the arm should be elevated for 5 min at 90 degrees before tourniquet inflation. Supplementary brachial arterial compression is not recommended as this tends to attenuate changes in volume...|$|R
