25|$|The {{question}} of the architectural function of the Kore of Lyons was solved by Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway in 1986; {{the upper part of}} the polos has some characteristics typical of caryatids, which Payne did not observe directly, but only through casts sent to Athens. The sculpture has a nick on the upper part for <b>a</b> <b>tenon,</b> supporting the theory of an architectural role. Another element supporting this conclusion is the reversal of the diagonal himation (going over the left rather than the more usual right shoulder) which is typical of mirrored pairs rather than isolated works. In addition the origin of the Ionian influence detected in the style of the work matches the near eastern origin of the caryatid as an architectural feature. On the other hand, the kore is very small and would only fit as the caryatid of a small naiskos or a secondary entrance and even then it would have to have been placed on top of a podium. A votive function cannot be excluded therefore.|$|E

50|$|A {{more recent}} {{innovation}} is the horizontal mortiser, which incorporates a router mounted statically {{on its side}} with the workpiece clamped to a multi-axis sliding table. This type of mortiser can produce either traditional mortise and tenon pairs, however it excels at floating (or 'loose') <b>tenons.</b> <b>A</b> floating <b>tenon</b> is where both the pieces of wood {{that are to be}} joined have aligned mortises cut into them and a separate piece of wood is milled into <b>a</b> fitted <b>tenon</b> which is glued into the two mortises.|$|R
25|$|A modern beginner's bassoon is {{generally}} made of maple, with medium-hardness types such as sycamore maple and sugar maple preferred. Less-expensive models are also made of {{materials such as}} polypropylene and ebonite, primarily for student and outdoor use; metal bassoons {{were made in the}} past but have not been produced by any major manufacturer since 1889. The bore of the bassoon is conical, like that of the oboe and the saxophone, and the two adjoining bores of the boot joint are connected {{at the bottom of the}} instrument with a U-shaped metal connector. Both bore and tone holes are precision-machined, and each instrument is finished by hand for proper tuning. The walls of the bassoon are thicker at various points along the bore; here, the tone holes are drilled at an angle to the axis of the bore, which reduces the distance between the holes on the exterior. This ensures coverage by the fingers of the average adult hand. Wooden instruments are lined with hard rubber along the interior of the wing and boot joints to prevent damage from moisture; wooden instruments are also stained and varnished. The end of the bell is usually fitted with a ring, either of metal, plastic or ivory. The joints between sections consist of <b>a</b> <b>tenon</b> fitting into a socket; the tenons are wrapped in either cork or string as a seal against air leaks. The bocal connects the reed to the rest of the instrument and is inserted into a socket at the top of the wing joint. Bocals come in many different lengths and styles, depending on the desired tuning and playing characteristics.|$|E
2500|$|In 1923 Henri Lechat {{published}} [...] {{an inventory}} of the collection of casts of the Lumière University Lyon 2 where he described the statue as [...] "the upper part of a statue of Aphrodite ... clad in the Ionian fashion... a kore, specifically a goddess by the polos {{on her head and}} identified as Aphrodite by the done in her right hand." [...] But Pane refuted this hypothesis, arguing that the polos is not strictly a divine attribute and restated the hypotheses that it was a caryatid on account of a hole present {{at the top of the}} head for the attachment of <b>a</b> <b>tenon,</b> or a votive statue on account of its small size.|$|E
2500|$|By January 1923 the {{foundation}} was almost completed and the granite walls {{for the first}} floor were rising. [...] Work proceeded very rapidly through June. By February 1923, $1 million had been spent on constructing {{the foundation}} and walls and on landscaping. Topsoil for the landscaping came from the Earl Strong Co. of Alexandria, the grass seed from O.M. Scotts and Sons of Ohio, and other trees, shrubs, and landscaping products from C.F. Armiger of Washington, D.C. Revenues easily exceeded these expenditures, as $1.8 million had been received in donations and pledges. The same month, the GWMNMA expanded {{its board of directors}} from nine to 12. By April 1923, the foundation had been fully excavated and the foundation walls constructed. The Washington Post reported that the concrete foundation was the largest ever cast in a single piece. The foundation (of articulate girder design) was [...] in size, [...] thick, and contained [...] of concrete. Plows pulled by mules had reshaped the side of the hill into its terraced form, and most of the landscaping was now done. Total cash donations received by April 1923 totaled more than $1 million. Concrete for the first floor was poured in June 1923, and once it had set the eight green [...] granite marble columns in the atrium were set in place. [...] Each green marble column was [...] high and [...] in diameter when finished. To prevent the columns from twisting or slipping, a mortise and tenon was used. [...] A mortise approximately [...] deep was created in the floor, and <b>a</b> <b>tenon</b> carved {{on the bottom of the}} column base. A small amount of mortar, mixed with small flat discs of metal, was used to help fix the tenon into the mortise. Between the base and the first drum (or section of the column), between the drums, and between the top drum and the capital were placed wedge-shaped thin sheets of lead to inhibit slippage. By October 15, the first floor and granite outer walls were complete.|$|E
