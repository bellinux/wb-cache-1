5|$|In Elmhurst, the {{destruction}} of {{almost all of the}} century-old buildings {{in the heart of the}} village were destroyed for the construction of the subway. Land was taken on the west side of the Broadway to avoid the demolition of the Saint James Episcopal Church and the Reformed Church. Many nineteenth century residences and the Wandowenock Fire Company buildings had to be torn down. To allow the subway line to curve into Queens Boulevard from Broadway, the northeast corner of the two streets was removed, in addition to some stores and an old Presbyterian chapel. New buildings were built behind a new curb line once the subway was completed, bringing <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>face</b> to Elmhurst. The introduction of the subway stimulated local growth in Elmhurst. Commercial buildings and apartment houses replaced existing structures.|$|E

This, combined with the political situation, and the miners' strike in 1984–85, contributed to problems at the colliery. The workforce attempted to open <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>face,</b> but a decision had been taken to close, and after two years of recovery work, Haig finally ceased mining on 31 March 1986. Today there is no mining carried out in Whitehaven.|$|E

500|$|Veerapandiya Kattabomman {{has often}} been criticised because of its {{historical}} inaccuracies. Guy stated in 2015 that a Tamil weekly even went {{to the extent of}} saying, [...] " [...] <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>face</b> called Kattabomman acted brilliantly as Sivaji Ganesan!" [...] Poet Kannadasan said that Kattabomman was not a real freedom fighter, but a Telugu and a robber. He also stated that the Maruthu Pandiyars were the real freedom fighters and wrote a script about them, which was adapted into the film, Sivagangai Seemai. Kannadasan's statement was supported by writer Lena Tamizhvanan, who denounced Kattabomman's glorification.|$|E
500|$|According to Professor John Meisel, {{who wrote}} a book about the 1957 campaign, Diefenbaker's {{speaking}} style was [...] "reminiscent of the fiery orators so popular in the nineteenth century. Indeed, Mr. Diefenbaker's oratory has been likened to that of the revivalist preacher." [...] As <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>face</b> on the national scene given to outspoken attacks on the government, he began to attract unexpectedly large crowds early in the campaign. When reduced to the written word, however, Diefenbaker's rhetoric sometimes proved to be without much meaning. According to journalist and author Peter C.

[...] Both Newman and Meisel cite as an example of this the conclusion to the leader's Massey Hall speech: ...|$|E

But hopefully people will come to accept it." [...] Mullally has compared the two versions of Declan saying [...] "One of the writers said to me in a meeting the other day that the changeover between James and me can be best described as James playing Declan as very strong, macho. He liked to get into things and was very proactive. [...] "The new Declan is more grown up, quite mature and savvy. He thinks with his head and knows what he wants and doesn't have to use brute force to get it." [...] During Rebecca's vision, Thomas Smith portrayed a six-year-old Declan.|$|E

2500|$|During the Grateful Dead's 1974 European tour, Wolf {{was dropped}} on several occasions, {{one of which}} caused a minor crack in the headstock.

Throughout its absence, Garcia predominantly played several Travis Bean guitars, including the TB1000A (1975) and the TB500 (1976-1977). On September 28, 1977, Irwin delivered the refurbished Wolf back to Garcia. The wolf sticker which gave the guitar its name had now been inlaid into the instrument; it also featured an effects loop between the pick-ups and controls (so inline effects would [...] "see" [...] the same signal at all times) which was bypassable.

They are then descended into a lair where they see the man from the river surrounded by other idle humanoid robots. [...] Observing mismatched body parts, the Doctor surmises the man is a long-lived cyborg, but in an unusual sense. [...] It is a robot trying to make itself human by replacing its mechanical parts with biological ones taken from spontaneous combustion victims, including the dinosaur.

[...] "When encountered with similar circumstances your body immediately goes into fight or flight mode." [...] However, Marty spending time with Todd and hearing about the rape in his own words does not help restore her memory, aside from one subconscious flashback to her rape. In addition, Marty believes everything Todd tells her and disregards picking up a phone or Googling herself. On October 3, 2008, Marty finally looks up her rape on the Internet and sees the faces of her rapists, but Todd gets there before she can find out their names. Due to Todd's plastic surgery, Marty does not recognize that one of the rapists in the pictures is Todd. Todd is able to convince Marty to do no further research about her rape.|$|E
2500|$|Before Andrea Martin {{accepted}} the role, director René Auberjonois (Odo) confided in her that {{working under the}} Ferengi prosthetics would be the hardest acting she'd ever done if she'd never worked under such makeup before. [...] Auberjonois speculated that she took the role anyway because he'd been so upfront with her. [...] Martin's makeup for Ishka took three hours every day. [...] Ishka, being older, required extra development of the makeup protheses. [...] Makeup designer Michael Westmore explained that they [...] "made a thin skin that went over one of [...] stock Ferengi heads [...] [...] They [...] made <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>face</b> for her, wrinkled, and did {{the backs of her}} hands." [...] The script for [...] "Family Business" [...] also complicated the makeup process because it called for Ishka to be nude in several scenes; therefore, makeup needed to be developed for parts of Ferengi never before seen. [...] One take over Ishka's shoulder had to be reshot because the producers felt that Martin's [...] "supple skin" [...] didn't match the character; Westmore and crew [...] "took Kleenex, wrinkled it up and rubberized it, and covered her back and shoulders", a process Martin didn't care for, saying, [...] "Boy, if you hadn't warned me about this, I would be out the door." ...|$|E
2500|$|The buildup to [...] "Bettymania" [...] {{by various}} {{broadcasters}} {{also began to}} take shape overseas, especially in the United Kingdom. On December 6, 2006, Channel 4 began to advertise the show. The ad shows seemingly attractive models gathered around a pool, but as the camera angle changes a model comes out of the pool wearing Betty's glasses, then as the models smile, they are all wearing Betty's braces. Another ad parodies Marks and Spencer's successful fashion advertising campaign, as well as Dove and Gap campaigns. A voice over then says, [...] "Fashion has <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>face.</b> 'Ugly Betty' Coming Soon To 4." [...] After a week of these teasers, clips from the actual program were included in the trailers. In mid-January, Davina McCall, presenter of Celebrity Big Brother dressed up as Betty live on Channel 4 before the titles of the second eviction show of the evening. On February 16, 2007, Ashley Jensen (Christina) also dressed up as Betty during an airing of Channel 4's Friday Night Project, where she was the guest host.
