5|$|Early Seventies Britain {{was a very}} {{depressing}} {{place with}} both the colour strike and the UK postal workers strike in full swing. It was completely run-down with trash on the streets, and total unemployment—just <b>about</b> <b>everybody</b> was on strike. Everybody was brought up with an education system that told you point blank that if you came from {{the wrong side of}} the tracks...then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all. Out of that came pretentious moi and the Sex Pistols and then a whole bunch of copycat wankers after us.|$|E
5|$|Noriega {{took great}} care to shape {{perceptions}} of himself. He permitted and encouraged rumors {{that as the}} chief of intelligence, he was in possession of negative information <b>about</b> <b>everybody</b> in the country. Dinges suggests that the impression among some officials that Noriega made money off of every transaction in the country may have been cultivated by Noriega himself. Among opposition leaders in Panama he was seen variously as a sexual pervert, as a sadist, and a rapist. Within U.S. government circles contradictory images abounded; Noriega {{was seen as a}} CIA spy, a drug trafficker, a nationalist supporting Torrijos, an ally of Cuba, and an ally of Oliver North and the Contras. He was perceived as a trusted collaborator in the war against drugs, even as the DEA was investigating him for involvement in smuggling. By the time of his removal he had come to be hated in the U.S., and the invasion was portrayed as an attempt to remove an evil man. Dinges writes that these contradictory images played a large role in the U.S. government's self-contradictory policy towards Noriega.|$|E

500|$|... "The key to {{understanding}} Smith," [...] Johnson wrote, [...] "was that, like other white Rhodesians, he clung to an almost Victorian {{view of the world}} both in moral values and in the easy assumptions of British primacy that characterised the empire." [...] Bill Schwarz took a similar line, writing that Smith and his supporters reacted to the British Empire's demise by imagining white Rhodesians to be [...] "the final survivors of a lost civilisation", charged with [...] "tak on the mantle of historic Britain" [...] in the imperial power's absence. [...] "He spoke endlessly about how Rhodesians had been more British than the British," [...] Boynton reflected, [...] "and how this small community of decent, fair-minded whites had been betrayed by, well, just <b>about</b> <b>everybody</b> he could think of... It was easy to mock Ian Smith, but he was right—both about the betrayals and about the quality of most African politicians". Smith's [...] "not in 1,000 years" [...] quote dominated his obituaries, a development that Peter Godwin, despite his critical stance regarding Smith and his policies, considered [...] "unfair and inaccurate": [...] "Over the years it has become shorn of all context and compressed into a free-floating clip that has now become his epitaph... But there is more than enough for which to quite legitimately criticise Smith, without resorting to fabrication." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics; many were {{more critical of}} the episode than [...] "Christmas Carol". Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B and wrote {{that he did not}} [...] "totally buy “Emily” [...] even though I like large portions of" [...] the episode. VanDerWerff wrote positively of [...] "most of the Scully scenes", noting that Anderson [...] "found some of the raw sense of hope and loss" [...] that the shots required. However, he was critical of the episode's plot, arguing that it only [...] "goes through the motions" [...] and [...] "is <b>about</b> <b>everybody</b> getting really worked up over a little girl we’ve just met." [...] He concluded that [...] "two-parter is strongest when it grabs hold of this notion. But it’s at its weakest when it turns into just another episode of The X-Files." [...] John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a 7 out of 10, and wrote [...] "Overall, this episode was not as strong as the previous installment, largely due to the shift from in-depth character exploration to a rehashing of earlier elements of the mythology. Emily is a good plot device in terms of personalizing the conspiracy’s depredations just a bit more, but at times, it seems like the writers are victimizing Scully a bit more than necessary. Unlike the later mythology episodes, however, this one manages to avoid any unnecessary new elements." ...|$|E
500|$|To promote Me Estoy Enamorando, Fernández {{launched}} his first solo tour performing in Argentina, Central America, Mexico, and the US. He also {{performed at the}} 1998 Viña del Mar festival in Chile. His set list consisted of rancheras from his past recordings, several tracks from Me Estoy Enamorando, and a Spanish-language rendition of Frank Sinatra's [...] "My Way". Fernández {{was accompanied by a}} 15-piece mariachi band for his ranchera performances. Reviewing his concert at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles, California, Los Angeles Times editor Ernesto Lechner felt that Fernández [...] "seemed to suffer from the same malady that affects most modern Mexican pop stars", citing [...] "Si Tú Supieras" [...] and [...] "No Sé Olvidar" [...] as [...] "unnervingly soulless". Alejandro Riera of the Chicago Tribune commented that Fernández has [...] "one mean set of pipes" [...] and [...] "used that voice to successfully seduce just <b>about</b> <b>everybody</b> in his mostly female audience". Riera also noted that unlike his father, Vicente, who sings [...] "the tequila-drenched songs of unrequited love", Alejandro [...] "praises the power that women hold over men. He sees them as superior beings even when he takes on the persona of the disdained lover." [...] Laura Emerick wrote a mixed review of his performance at the Rosement Theatre. She felt that even though Fernández is focused on being independent from his father, [...] "young Alejandro remains a pony, not a stylistic stallion like his father. He lacks the vocal finesse and stage presence that make Vicente such a galvanizing force." [...] She observed that the mariachi band [...] "looked bored". Emerick however praised his ranchera tunes.|$|E

500|$|... "742617000027" [...] is the intro {{track to}} the album. It {{contains}} some guitar scratches and abstract sound {{samples from the}} sampler Craig Jones. Some of the dialogue was reportedly taken from a Charles Manson documentary. The dialogue is [...] "The whole thing, I think it's sick." [...] In an interview shortly after the album was released, Joey Jordison claimed the voice is Corey Taylor's, sped up. 742617000027 was the barcode number on their 1996 self-released album Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. All of the band members wear that number on their jumpsuits. [...] "Wait and Bleed" [...] is {{about a man who}} keeps having repetitive black and white dreams about laying in a bathtub full of his own blood with his wrists slit. One day, he wakes up and sees that his dream has become a reality. However, he doesn't want to believe it and he tries to fall back asleep again. Chris Fehn said that [...] "Surfacing" [...] "basically encompasses everything. Kind of encompasses the attitude of the band and the attitude of how we feel about life: Don't judge me. Everything that you think that you know about the world, and about Slipknot, and about your own life, might not be the case. So I think it's just openmindedness and just be cool." [...] Paul Gray said about the meaning behind [...] "Surfacing" [...] chorus: [...] "Basically, we dedicate it to the kids as their new national anthem. It's our way of saying don't worry <b>about</b> <b>everybody</b> else. Just worry about yourself. Don't worry about the people judging and the people coming down on you and all the fake crap. Stick to what you believe in." [...] "Spit It Out" [...] was written in response to some individuals who worked at a local radio station in Des Moines, Iowa, where Slipknot is from. These individuals worked hard to keep Slipknot off the air. [...] "Prosthetics" [...] was inspired by the 1965 film The Collector, which is about a butterfly collector who chose to collect humans, too.|$|E

2500|$|Burr's weight, {{always an}} issue for him in getting roles, became a public {{relations}} problem when Johnny Carson began making jokes about him during his Tonight Show monologues. Burr refused to appear as Carson's guest from then on, and told Us Weekly years later: [...] "I have been asked {{a number of times}} to do his show and I won't do it. Because I like NBC. He's doing an NBC show. If I went on I'd have some things to say, not just about the bad jokes he's done about me, but bad jokes he does <b>about</b> <b>everybody</b> who can't fight back because they aren't there. And that wouldn't be good for NBC." [...] In later life, his distinctive physique and manner {{could be used as a}} reference that would be universally recognized.

[...] Amongst the changes to the show, some Wack Pack members have been given less offensive names; Wendy the Retard was renamed Wendy the Slow Adult.

2500|$|Though Erik distrusted {{the nobility}} as a whole, he became {{particularly}} suspicious of Nils Svantesson Sture, {{who was arrested}} and tried. Despite his many illegitimate children, Erik lacked a legal heir and feared that Sture might claim his throne. The Stures were a very influential family, and Erik projected an astrological reading on Nils Sture saying {{that he would be}} succeeded by a [...] "light-haired man". According to Peterson (2007),"the strain of war, paranoia toward just <b>about</b> <b>everybody,</b> especially the aristocracy, personal and national pressures to provide an heir, and his own mercurial personality were steadily crowding Erik to the edge of mental collapse. His frustrations and anxieties gradually began to center on one person."On the basis of unsubstantiated charges like [...] "neglect of duty," [...] Nils Sture was sentenced to death, but the verdict was commuted to a humiliating drive through the streets of the capital: on 15 June 1566, he had to ride through Stockholm on a wretched hack wearing a crown of straw, with some of his wounds suffered from prior torture still bleeding. Thereafter, Erik sent Nils Sture to Lorraine, where he was to arrange the marriage of princess Renata to Erik (which would never materialize).|$|E
