50|$|An {{idle stop}} feature {{shuts off the}} engine {{automatically}} when stopped, then restarts immediately when the driver removes their foot from the brake. This <b>auto</b> <b>idle</b> stop system contributes to both greater fuel efficiency and lower emissions.During stop and go driving, the engine will turn off when the car {{comes to a stop}} for the first time, however, if the car does not go above 10 mph and stops again, the engine will not turn off unless the car is stopped for more than 15 seconds.|$|E
40|$|International audienceMost of the {{domestic}} designed hydraulic excavators adopt the constant power design method and set 85 %~ 90 % of engine power as the hydraulic system adoption power, it causes high energy loss due to mismatching of power between the engine and the pump. While the variation of the rotational speed of engine could sense the power shift of the load, it provides a new method to adjust the power matching between engine and pump through engine speed. Based on negative flux hydraulic system, an intelligent hydraulic excavator control system was designed based on rotational speed sensing method to improve energy efficiency. The control system was consisted of engine control module, pump power adjusted module, engine idle module and system fault diagnosis module. Special PLC with CAN bus was used to acquired the sensors and adjusts the pump absorption power according to load variation. Four energy saving control strategies with constant power method were employed to improve the fuel utilization. Three power modes (H, S and L mode) were designed to meet different working status; <b>Auto</b> <b>idle</b> function was employed to save energy through two work status detected pressure switches, 1300 rpm was setting as the idle speed according to the engine consumption fuel curve. Transient overload function was designed for deep digging within short time without spending extra fuel. An increasing PID method was employed to realize power matching between engine and pump, the rotational speed's variation was taken as the PID algorithm's input; the current of proportional valve of variable displacement pump was the PID's output. The result indicated that the <b>auto</b> <b>idle</b> could decrease fuel consumption by 33. 33 % compared to work in maximum speed of H mode, the PID control method could take full use of maximum engine power at each power mode and keep the engine speed at stable range. Application of rotational speed sensing method provides a reliable method to improve the excavator's energy efficiency and realize power match between pump and engine...|$|E
50|$|The DL650 engine {{electronics}} aid {{starting and}} throttle control and uses Suzuki's AFIS (<b>Auto</b> Fast <b>Idle</b> System), eliminating a fast-idle control. The {{engine control module}} (ECM) reads engine information, such as coolant temperature, via a 32-bit central processing unit (CPU), controlling the fuel system's dual throttle bodies.|$|R
50|$|Although earlier ferries {{had carried}} teams and wagons, Melrose was {{launched}} in 1909 as the first San Francisco Bay ferry built with an unobstructed lower deck specifically intended for automobiles, and an upper deck for passengers. Southern Pacific ferries Melrose and Thoroughfare were designated to carry automobiles to and from San Francisco on the original Creek Route in 1911. Southern Pacific built new facilities to shift auto routing to the Oakland Pier in 1921 and purchased three new Six Minute ferries. In 1922, Golden Gate Ferry Company (GG) began transporting automobiles between Hyde Street Pier in San Francisco and Sausalito in Marin County. Southern Pacific purchased three more auto ferries with a ferry route linking San Francisco with a Richmond, California connection to the Lincoln Highway in 1925. Golden Gate established another route between Hyde Street and Berkeley Pier in 1927. Southern Pacific built six diesel-electric ferries and gained control of Golden Gate's Golden-prefix ferries to form the subsidiary Southern Pacific-Golden Gate Company in 1929. Another auto ferry pier operated {{at the foot of}} Broadway. Southern Pacific-Golden Gate auto ferries ceased operation shortly after the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and Golden Gate Bridge opened. A few of the larger ferries were purchased by the Richmond-San Rafael Ferry Company to shuttle automobiles between Richmond and San Rafael, but most were sold for use in Puget Sound. The surviving <b>auto</b> ferries were <b>idled</b> when the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge opened in 1956.|$|R
