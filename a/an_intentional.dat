5|$|Although the Navy was {{satisfied}} with the investigation and its results, others were unconvinced, and in October 1991, amid increasing criticism, Congress forced the Navy to reopen the investigation. This second investigation, handled by independent investigators, was hampered {{by the fact that}} most of the original debris from Iowa had been cleaned up or otherwise disposed of by the Navy before and after the first investigation, but it did uncover evidence pointing to an accidental powder explosion rather than <b>an</b> <b>intentional</b> act of sabotage.|$|E
5|$|From the Tech 32-yard line, Davis {{threw an}} {{incomplete}} pass then connected on a 21-yard pass to Jarvis {{for a first}} down. After an incomplete pass, Davis threw another pass to Jarvis, who caught it at the four-yard line. Facing third down, Davis attempted another pass. The ball was tipped {{into the air and}} caught by Virginia Tech defender Brent Warren. The Hokies resumed running down the clock with short rushes by Evans, who advanced the ball to the 13-yard line with 3:05 remaining in the game. Boston College used its allotted second-half timeouts to stop the clock and preserve time for a late scoring drive. In a strategic move, Tech coach Frank Beamer ordered <b>an</b> <b>intentional</b> safety rather than attempt a punt from the Tech end zone. Any such kick {{has the potential to be}} blocked for a defensive touchdown. Thus, <b>an</b> <b>intentional</b> safety gives the defense two points while denying them the slight chance to score seven. The score cut Virginia Tech's lead to 30–12 with 3:05 remaining, but the limited time remaining meant Tech's lead would be sufficient to win the game without a series of unlikely events.|$|E

A similar breathing pattern {{can be used to}} prevent normal vomiting. Breathing in this method works by physically preventing the abdominal contractions required to expel stomach contents.|$|E
5|$|In {{supporting}} Octavian, Antony {{expected to}} gain {{support for his}} own campaign against Parthia, desiring to avenge Rome's defeat at Carrhae in 53BC. In an agreement reached at Tarentum, Antony provided 120 ships for Octavian to use against Pompeius, while Octavian was to send 20,000 legionaries to Antony for use against Parthia. Octavian sent only a tenth of those promised, however, which Antony viewed as <b>an</b> <b>intentional</b> provocation.|$|E
5|$|Scholars of anthropology, sociology, and {{feminism}} {{have pointed}} out the symbolic nature of phallic architecture, especially large skyscrapers which dominate the landscape as symbols of male domination, power and political authority.

There are numerous reasons for the loss of so many silent films, three chief causes being: (<b>a)</b> <b>intentional</b> destruction by film studios after the silent era ended, (b) damage due to environmental degradation of the films themselves, and (c) fires in the vaults in which studios stored their films.|$|R
5|$|Some philosophers, such as Paul Boghossian, have {{attempted}} to show that eliminativism is in some sense self-refuting, since the theory itself presupposes the existence of mental phenomena. If eliminativism is true, then the eliminativist must permit <b>an</b> <b>intentional</b> property like truth, supposing {{that in order to}} assert something one must believe it. Hence, for eliminativism to be asserted as a thesis, the eliminativist must believe that it is true; if that is the case, then there are beliefs and the eliminativist claim is false.|$|E
5|$|Although these criticisms still {{form the}} {{prevailing}} {{view on the}} History's literary worth, modern scholars such as Rohrbacher have begun to argue that, while it is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished work, its use of allusion {{as a vehicle for}} parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that the very features which were once a cause for intense criticism (such as the inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material) are actually <b>an</b> <b>intentional</b> and integral part of the work, {{making it one of the}} most unique pieces of literature to emerge from the ancient world.|$|E

5|$|Marx's {{thoughts}} on labour {{were related to}} the primacy he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also economic determinism). Accumulation of capital shapes the social system. For Marx, social change was about conflict between opposing interests, driven in the background by economic forces. This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the conflict theory. In his evolutionary model of history, he argued that human history began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism. Marx noted that this was not <b>an</b> <b>intentional</b> process, rather no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy.|$|E
5|$|Tech's post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Alabama 15-yard line, and the Crimson Tide began a new drive. On the drive's first play, Tech committed a five-yard offsides penalty. Following the penalty, Alexander was stopped for a two-yard loss. Zow then completed a 40-yard pass for a first down at the Tech 43-yard line. After that long completion, he threw an 11-yard pass for another first down, this time at the Tech 32-yard line. A rushing play was stopped for no gain, Zow threw an incomplete pass into the end zone, then Zow committed <b>an</b> <b>intentional</b> grounding penalty {{in an attempt to}} avoid being sacked. The penalty pushed Alabama out of field goal range, and Alabama punted from the Tech 45-yard line.|$|E
5|$|The Theban plays {{consist of}} three plays: Oedipus Rex (also called Oedipus Tyrannus or Oedipus the King), Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone. All three plays concern {{the fate of}} Thebes {{during and after the}} reign of King Oedipus. They have often been {{published}} under a single cover. Sophocles, however, wrote the three plays for separate festival competitions, many years apart. Not only are the Theban plays not a true trilogy (three plays presented as a continuous narrative) but they are not even <b>an</b> <b>intentional</b> series and contain some inconsistencies among them. He also wrote other plays having to do with Thebes, such as the Epigoni, of which only fragments have survived.|$|E

5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Stéphane Sednaoui, brought even more mainstream success {{to the band}} through repeated airplay on MTV. The video debuted in September 1993. It was shot with low quality photographic equipment, which, like several other early Pumpkins videos, was <b>an</b> <b>intentional</b> stylistic decision. Corgan said that {{the plot of the}} video was inspired by a memory he had of an ice cream truck driver who, upon quitting his job, gave out his remaining stock of ice cream to the neighborhood children. This image was then melded with Sednaoui's own sensibilities inspired by the film Zabriskie Point. The video is available on The Smashing Pumpkins – Greatest Hits Video Collection (1991–2000) DVD, released in 2001.|$|E
5|$|With {{two outs}} in the 9th inning {{of a game}} against the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 28, 1998, Bonds became only the fifth player in {{baseball}} history to be given <b>an</b> <b>intentional</b> walk with the bases loaded. Nap Lajoie (1901), Del Bissonette (1928) and Bill Nicholson (1944) were three others in the 20th century who received that rare honor. The first to receive one was Abner Dalrymple in 1881. During {{a game against the}} Philadelphia Phillies on August 2, Bonds was hit by a pitch thrown by Ricky Bottalico, leading to Bonds charging the mound and triggering a bench-clearing brawl.|$|E
5|$|At {{one year}} of age, joint {{attention}} is displayed through a child's understanding of pointing as <b>an</b> <b>intentional</b> act. One-year-olds also establish joint attention for objects within their visual field before objects beyond their current visual field. At this age, infants are not yet able to represent their entire environment, only what they can see. At age 15 months, children recognize the minds of others. At this age, children also {{recognize the importance of}} eyes for seeing and that physical objects can block sight. At age 18 months, infants are capable of following an individual's gaze to outside their visual field and establishing (representative) joint attention. 18-month-olds also grasp the intentional, referential nature of looking, the mentalistic experience of seeing and the role of eyes and are skilled at following both gaze and pointing with precision. At two years of age, children display joint attention by extending attention beyond the present and understanding that the targets of other's attention extends to the past as well. Two-year-olds are also capable of representational thought or increased memory.|$|E

5|$|Following Florida State's post-touchdown kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense {{began its}} third {{possession}} of the game at the Tech 24-yard line after a short kick return. Running back Andre Kendrick ran for a short gain, but on the next play Vick was called for <b>an</b> <b>intentional</b> grounding penalty while attempting to avoid a sack. The Hokies were unable {{to make up the}} yardage lost by the penalty and punted after failing to gain a first down. Owing to the penalty, Tech punter Jimmy Kibble was forced to kick from his own end zone. Florida State was able to break through the Tech offensive line during the punt and blocked the kick. The ball was picked up by Florida State defender Jeff Chaney, who dashed into the end zone for Florida State's second touchdown of the game. The score and extra point gave Florida State a 140 lead with 2:14 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|Once again {{facing the}} New England Patriots, the New York Giants headed to Lucas Oil Stadium, home of Eli's brother Peyton's team, the Indianapolis Colts. The Giants {{got off to}} an early lead by <b>an</b> <b>intentional</b> {{grounding}} call on Tom Brady {{in the end zone}} for a safety and retaining the ball for most of the 1st quarter. However, New England came back and battled to a 10–9 lead. Nearing the end of the 4th quarter with the Giants behind 17–15, Patriots coach Bill Belichick allowed them to score a touchdown with the idea that they would have nearly a minute to drive downfield and score. However, the New York defense held and broke up several Brady pass attempts. A last-second throw into the end zone by the Patriots QB was thwarted and the Giants had won their second Super Bowl 21–17 in four years at New England's expense.|$|E
5|$|The first goaltender {{credited}} with an {{assist in the}} NHL was Georges Vezina in the 1917–18 season, after a puck rebounded off his leg pad to a teammate who skated {{the length of the}} ice to score. In the 1935–36 season, Tiny Thompson became the first goaltender to gain an assist after making <b>an</b> <b>intentional</b> pass. During the Second World War, while playing for the All-Star Canadian Army team, goaltender Chuck Rayner carried the puck down the ice and beat the opposing goaltender, Art Jones. In the NHL, he made numerous unsuccessful attempts to duplicate this feat; {{as a member of the}} New York Rangers, Rayner attempted to score both by aiming at an empty net and by rushing down the rink. There are at least two recorded instances of him skating to the other side of the ice after making a save, and he was experimentally used on the point during power-plays in late 1940s.|$|E
