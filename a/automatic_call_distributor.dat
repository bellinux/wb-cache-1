50|$|An <b>Automatic</b> <b>call</b> <b>distributor</b> (ACD) is a {{communication}} system that automatically queues, assigns and connects callers to handlers. This is used often in customer service (such as for {{product or service}} complaints), ordering by telephone (such as in a ticket office), or coordination services (such as in air traffic control).|$|E
50|$|This {{configuration}} is {{most often}} found on multi-line phones found at small businesses. For <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> <b>distributor</b> systems with high call volumes, this is usually the least preferable method, because calls will arrive at destinations {{that are in the}} process of completing the previous call, and depending on the circumstances, may be the least prepared to take the call.|$|E
40|$|Call center {{customer}} service representatives (CSRs) or agents {{tend to have}} different skills. Some CSRs can handle one type of call, while other CSRs can handle other types of <b>calls.</b> Advances in <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> <b>distributors</b> (ACDs) {{have made it possible}} to have skill-based routing (SBR) which is the protocol for online routing of incoming calls to the appropriate CSRs. At present, very little is known about SBR. We develop a discrete-event simulation model to analyze the performance of a Mn/Mn/C/K SBR environment in which incoming calls are handled in priority order and in a non-preemptive manner. We use the design of experiment framework to conduct our analysis. We show empirically that the scenario in which agents have 2 skills is almost as efficient as the scenario where agents have all skills (resource pooling). Also, we discover that no interaction exists between call rate factors when resource pooling exists. ...|$|R
5000|$|In about 1978 the {{development}} of the <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> <b>distributors</b> began, with the MACD (medium ACD) being released first at Frontier Airlines, followed by small and very small systems in short succession. By 1980, the 580 PBX and ACD development effort had effectively bankrupted Wescom with many vendors having placed the company on credit hold. Rockwell Intl purchased Wescom in 1980 solving Wescom's cash problems and embarking the company onto the common carrier market, creating the SCX product line. SCX provided the early backbone for the early MCI network after the break-up of AT&T. Rockwell already had a successful ACD business with the [...] "Galaxy" [...] system through their Collins Radio arm. Rockwell's interest in the 580 product line centered on its 100% non-blocking network frame that connected the voice paths within the system. The network frame actually had additional switching capability that would later be utilized to process digital connections.|$|R
40|$|Call centers usually handle {{several types}} of calls. To do so effectively, agents are given special training. However, it is often not {{cost-effective}} to have every agent {{be able to handle}} every type of call. Thus, the agents tend to have different skills, in different combinations. Call centers are equipped with <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> <b>distributors</b> to assign <b>calls</b> to appropriate agents, i. e., to perform skill-based routing (SBR). However, it is challenging to do skill-based routing well. Moreover, it is challenging to determine the staff requirements in an SBR call center. This paper addresses these problems. The main idea is to seek simplification through resource pooling, i. e., the notion that with (i) only a limited amount of cross training (e. g., perhaps even when agents have at most two skills) and (ii) a reasonable scheduling policy, the call center performance may be nearly the same as if all agents had all skills (and scheduling was not an issue at all). First, simulation experiments within a particular SBR framework show that resource pooling indeed occurs. Second, resource pooling is exploited to develop an effective algorithm to generate staffing requirements. The staffing algorithm exploits the classical Erlang model to determine an initial estimate for the total staff needed in the call center. Motivated by heavy-traffi...|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} call centres {{dates back to}} the 1960s with the UK-based Birmingham Press and Mail, which {{installed}} Private Automated Business Exchanges (PABX) to have rows of agents handling customer contacts.

5000|$|Skills-based routing (SBR), or Skills-based call routing, is a call-assignment {{strategy}} used in call {{centers to}} assign incoming {{calls to the}} most suitable agent, instead of simply choosing the next available agent. It is an enhancement to the <b>Automatic</b> <b>Call</b> <b>Distributor</b> (ACD) systems found in most call centers. The need for skills-based routing has arisen, as call centers have become larger and dealt with {{a wider variety of}} call types.|$|E
50|$|Although ACDs {{appeared}} in the 1950s, {{one of the first}} large and separate ACDs was a modified 5XB switch used by the New York Telephone Company in the early 1970s to distribute calls among hundreds of 4-1-1 information operators. Robert Hirvela developed and received a patent for technology that was used to create the Rockwell Galaxy <b>Automatic</b> <b>Call</b> <b>Distributor,</b> which was used by Continental Airlines for more than 20 years.

We propose an efficient adaptive threshold policy that is easy to implement in the <b>Automatic</b> <b>Call</b> <b>Distributor</b> (ACD).

40|$|A (customer) {{contact center}} is a {{collection}} of resources providing an interface between a service provider and its customers. The classical contact {{center is a}} call center, containing a collection of service representatives (reps) who talk to customers over the telephone. In a call center, the service reps are supported by quite elaborate information-and-communication-technology (ICT) equipment, such as a private branch exchange (PBX), an interactive voice response (IVR) unit, an <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> <b>distributor</b> (ACD), a personal computer (PC) and assorted databases. With the rapid growth of e-commerce, contact between the service provider and its customers if often made via e-mail or the Internet instead of by telephone. Thus the general interface between a service provider and its customers is now often called a contact center. The design and management of contact centers is important, and worthy of research, because contact centers comprise a large, growing part of the economy and because they are quite complicated.

40|$|In today’s world call {{centers are}} {{operated}} as service centers {{and means of}} revenue generation. The key trade-off between customer service quality and efficiency of business operations faced by an operations manager in a call center is also the central tension that a human resource manager needs to manage (Aksin, Armony, & Mehrotra, 2007). By looking at the importance of providing efficiency at service quality, this dissertation conducts the research which describes forecasting approaches {{that can be applied}} to any call center. A case study research is conducted on Telecom New Zealand call center data which is based on a 15 minutes call interval data collected from call centers for the years 2007 and 2008 during the period of normal and abnormal (i. e. traffic jam) call distributions. Specifically, this research proposed a novel personalized call prediction method considering the importance of agent skill information for call center staff scheduling and management. Applying the proposed method, two call broker models: (1) personalized agent software broker, and (2) supervisor involved personalized software broker are further developed in this dissertation to construct a new generation call center IT solution for small size companies, and as well for large companies such as Telecom New Zealand. In this dissertation, a problem – solution approach is implemented. An initial step for problem generalization is to analyze and perform call predictions. The existing methods for call predictions implement inductive systems and are based on global models and thus cannot generate consistently good prediction accuracy, especially when traffic jam is confronted and/or if there is an abnormal increase of call volume which in turn makes calls to be abandoned affecting the service levels in the call center. In addition, since {{increase in the number of}} agents cannot be changed at short intervals of time, a personalized approach models an intelligent broker for every individual agent in the call center. This in turn expected to improve the generalworking efficiency of a call center, as compared to the traditional approach that use merely one broker for a number of agents. This concept is implemented using the proposed personalized prediction method, and demonstrated while comparing with other methods on call volume prediction experiments over real data streams from Telecom New Zealand. The proposed two broker models are both based on Personalized Prediction method. The first model uses the concept of software call broker which aims to implement the proposed prediction method as an <b>Automatic</b> <b>Call</b> <b>Distributor</b> (ACD). The second model, the supervised call broker is based on the concept of real time supervised observations of agent’s performance and then computing predicted calls for each agent. The broker implements the assisted knowledge of supervisor to select an appropriate agent to service the customer request. The proposed call broker models will depict as IT solutions for traffic jam problem. The Traffic Jam as addressed in the dissertation conducts the cost and return calculation as a measure for TNZ Return on Investment (ROI). While introducing the concept of traffic jam problem solving here from section 4. 5. 2, the non-personalized prediction method could release the traffic jam in 8. 60 days with a saving in time of 1. 40 days. This is in contrast to the personalized prediction method that releases the traffic jam in 8. 48 days and a saving of 1. 52 days. Meanwhile, the supervised call broker model can release a traffic jam in 8. 04 days with a saving of 1. 96 days to predict the traffic jam. The dissertation summarizes that, the intensity of traffic jam and cost/output analysis for scheduling more agents to improve the service factors at short intervals of time will be a challenging task for any call center. As observed the benefits of savings is achieved by improvements in the level of service that couldn’t outweigh the costs of hiring new agents and in addition, couldn’t improve the profitability of Telecom New Zealand during the period of traffic jam. Hence, the proposed method of personalized broker with supervisor role can be an alternative to provide a better service levels to any bigger call centers like Telecom New Zealand. For any other small size call centers consisting of 2 - 5 agents, implementing software call broker will resolve the problem of traffic jam and as a best possible solution to maximize Return on Investment...|$|E
