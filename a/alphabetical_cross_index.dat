40|$|To {{determine}} the possible {{existence of a}} relationship between insulin resistance and sympathetic nervous system activity in essential hypertension, we calculated the double <b>cross</b> <b>index</b> for 14 hypertensive subjects and 14 normotensive subjects submitted to the oral glucose test. Plasma glucose and insulin levels were similar in hypertensive and normotensive subjects. After glucose loading, however, both parameters were significantly higher in hypertensive subjects. Five out of 14 hypertensive patients were hyperinsulinemic. The increase in double <b>cross</b> <b>index</b> following a glucose load was significantly higher in normotensive volunteers than in hyperinsulinemic hypertensive subjects. No change in double <b>cross</b> <b>index</b> was observed in normoinsulinemic hypertensive subjects. Thus, insulin resistance, high blood glucose level, impairment of cardiac response and hyperinsulinemia are present in {{a significant portion of}} hypertensive patients. Hyperinsulinemia may contribute to hypertension by stimulating sympathetic nervous system activity, by influencing the calcium transport across the cell membrane and/or by some other mechanism...|$|R

40|$|A {{machine-readable}} {{version of}} the Washington Catalog of Visual Double Stars (WDS) was prepared in 1984 {{on the basis of}} a data file that was collected and maintained for more than a century by a succession of double-star observers. Although this catalog is being continually updated, a new copy for distribution is not expected to be available for a few years. The WDS contains DM numbers, but many of these are listed only in the notes, which makes it difficult to search for double-star information, except by position. Hence, a <b>cross</b> <b>index</b> that provides complete DM identifications is desirable, and it appears useful to add HD numbers for systems in that catalog.
