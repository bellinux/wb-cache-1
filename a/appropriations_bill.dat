50|$|There {{are three}} types of {{appropriations}} bills: regular <b>appropriations</b> <b>bills,</b> continuing resolutions, and supplemental <b>appropriations</b> <b>bills.</b> Regular <b>appropriations</b> <b>bills</b> are the twelve standard bills that cover the funding {{for the federal government}} for one fiscal year and that are supposed to be enacted into law by October 1. If Congress has not enacted the regular <b>appropriations</b> <b>bills</b> by the time, it can pass a continuing resolution, which continues the pre-existing appropriations at the same levels as the previous fiscal year (or with minor modifications) for a set amount of time. The third type of <b>appropriations</b> <b>bills</b> are supplemental <b>appropriations</b> <b>bills,</b> which add additional funding above and beyond what was originally appropriated {{at the beginning of the}} fiscal year. Supplemental <b>appropriations</b> <b>bills</b> can be used for things like disaster relief.|$|R

At the same time the Congress directed NASA to move the mission forward to the development phase.

5|$|On March 3, 1873, President Grant {{signed a}} law that {{authorized}} the President's salary to be increased from $25,000 a year to $50,000 a year and Congressmen's salaries to be increased by $2,500. Representatives also received a retroactive pay bonus for previous two years of service. This was done in secret and attached to a general <b>appropriations</b> <b>bill.</b> Reforming newspapers quickly exposed {{the law and the}} bonus was repealed in January 1874. Grant missed an opportunity to veto the bill and to make a strong statement for good government.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Congress {{passed the}} Line Item Veto Act, which allowed the {{president}} to cancel items from an <b>appropriations</b> <b>bill</b> (a bill authorizing spending) once passed into law. The statute was challenged the following year. The matter rapidly reached the Supreme Court, which struck down the law as violating the Presentment Clause of the Constitution, which governs {{what the president is}} permitted to do with a bill once it has passed both houses of Congress. Scalia dissented, seeing no Presentment Clause difficulties and feeling that the act did not violate separation of powers. Scalia indicated he felt that authorizing {{the president to}} cancel an appropriation was no different from allowing him to spend an appropriation at his discretion, which had long been accepted as constitutional.|$|E
50|$|Supplemental <b>appropriations</b> <b>bills</b> {{increase}} {{funding for}} activities {{that were already}} funded in previous <b>appropriations</b> <b>bills</b> or they provide new funding for unexpected expenses. For example, both the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War were funded {{with a variety of}} supplemental <b>appropriations.</b> Supplemental <b>appropriations</b> <b>bills</b> also provide funding for recovering from unexpected natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy (the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013).|$|R

50|$|Much of {{the costs}} for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have not been funded through regular <b>appropriations</b> <b>bills,</b> but through {{emergency}} supplemental <b>appropriations</b> <b>bills.</b> As such, most of these expenses {{were not included in}} the budget deficit calculation prior to FY2010. Some budget experts argue that emergency supplemental <b>appropriations</b> <b>bills</b> do not receive the same level of legislative care as regular <b>appropriations</b> <b>bills.</b> In addition, emergency supplemental appropriations are not subject to the same budget enforcement mechanisms imposed on regular appropriations. Funding for the first stages of the Vietnam War was provided by supplemental appropriations, although President Johnson eventually acceded to Congressional demands to fund that war through the regular appropriations process.|$|R
5|$|Without the {{enactment}} of an <b>appropriations</b> <b>bill,</b> the state government would not have funds to operate, and the Democrats assumed that Morton {{would be forced to}} call a special session and recall the Republicans. The Democrats hoped to once again press their measures to weaken the governor, but Morton was aware of their plans. Going beyond his constitutional powers, Morton solicited millions of dollars in federal and private loans. Morton's move to subvert the state legislature was successful; he was able to privately fund the state government and the war effort in Indiana. Former Hoosier James Lanier of the New York banking firm of Winslow, Lanier and Company loaned Morton funds to pay interest on the state's debt until the state government could resume its revenue collecting efforts.|$|E
5|$|According to a MinnPost poll, Minnesotans {{blamed the}} Republican {{legislature}} {{more for the}} shutdown. Overall, 42% said Republicans in the legislature were more responsible, 21% said the DFL governor was more responsible, and 22% volunteered an answer that they were equally to blame. As expected, partisans blamed the other party more; only 10% of Republicans blamed the legislature more, and only 2% of DFLers blamed Dayton more. Following the shutdown, DFL Representative Phyllis Kahn authored a continuing <b>appropriations</b> <b>bill</b> that would prevent government shutdowns {{in the event of}} disagreements between the governor and legislature, as she had done in several past sessions. The House commissioned a policy brief from its research department, published in December 2011, that looked into what such a bill would require. The brief noted that such ideas had been considered before, including after the 2005 shutdown, and had been abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} {{means of}} paying for the statue was a commemorative coin. In early 1899, the commission sought enactment of legislation granting it an appropriation of $50,000 {{in the form of}} 100,000 commemorative half dollars, that could be sold to the public at a premium. Such a method had helped to finance (though with mixed success) the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Instead, Congress passed and McKinley signed on March 3, 1899, a civil <b>appropriations</b> <b>bill</b> that included provision for 50,000 silver one-dollar pieces to be granted to the commission. The bullion for the striking was to be purchased on the open market and was not to come from the Mint's remaining stocks acquired pursuant to the repealed Sherman Silver Purchase Act, though the Mint would not exhaust its inventory from that legislation until 1904. Congress placed a ceiling on the cost of the silver at $25,000. In the event, the United States Treasury bought 38,675.875 troy ounces of silver for $23,032.80. The designs were to be selected by the Mint Director, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.|$|E

5|$|As {{the country}} {{continued}} to expand, {{the issue of}} slavery in its new territories became the dominant national issue. The Southern position was that slaves were property and therefore could be moved to the territories like all other forms of property. The 1820 Missouri Compromise provided for the admission of Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, preserving the Senate's equality between the regions. In 1846, the Wilmot Proviso was introduced to a war <b>appropriations</b> <b>bill</b> to ban slavery in all territories acquired in the Mexican–American War; the Proviso repeatedly passed the House, but not the Senate. The Compromise of 1850 temporarily defused the issue by admitting California as a free state, instituting a stronger Fugitive Slave Act, banning the slave trade in Washington, D.C., and allowing New Mexico and Utah self-determination on the slavery issue.|$|E
5|$|The CSR {{subsidies}} {{are paid to}} insurance companies to reduce copayments and deductibles for a smaller group of ACA enrollees, those earning less than 250% of the federal poverty line (FPL). The second and larger type of subsidy, the premium tax credits designed to reduce the post-subsidy cost of monthly premiums, apply to all enrollees earning less than 400% of the FPL. For scale, during 2017, approximately $7 billion in CSR subsidies will be paid, versus $34 billion for the premium tax credits. A court decision meant that CSR subsidies were treated as discretionary spending, meaning Congress must decide to appropriate funds for them each year. This effectively gave the President the power to end them, as Democrats with a minority in Congress could not appropriate the funds, let alone override his veto of an <b>appropriations</b> <b>bill.</b>|$|E
5|$|The new {{constitution}} {{led to the}} gradual erosion of the Democratic majority. In 1854, the Republican Party was established and drew {{in many of the}} former Whigs. That year the General Assembly was split with no party attaining a majority. The Democrats held the largest number of seats, but the Whigs and Republicans caucused to form a majority and control the assembly. The result was deadlock on most issues because Republicans and Whigs could not agree on most major issues. By 1858, the Whigs were almost completely disempowered and the Republicans gained enough seats to become the largest party, but not enough to form a majority on their own. That year Governor Ashbel P. Willard called the first special session of the General Assembly because they had been unable to pass an <b>appropriations</b> <b>bill.</b> Democrats regained a small majority by gaining the votes of the disaffected Whigs in the 1860 election.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, the NPS {{began the}} process of {{developing}} a management plan for the Cumberland Island horse. After compiling information, they released a draft environmental assessment in early 1996 and began taking public comment on a potential management plan. Public opinion was severely divided, with environmentalists approving of the management plan, which would have likely resulted in the reduction or removal of the herd, and animal rights activists and island residents protesting the plan. However, before a plan could be implemented, US Representative Jack Kingston included a provision in a federal <b>appropriations</b> <b>bill</b> that prevented any management of the horses. Kingston made the change to the bill after touring the island, but without consultation with the NPS. He initially claimed that he personally did not see significant damage to the island from the horses, and that the herd size had decreased. However, upon later questioning, he refused to expand upon his observations of the damage to the island. The provision expired in 1997, but effectively halted momentum toward a park management plan. The study published in 2000 recommended a management strategy that reduced herd populations to environmentally-recommended sizes through a combination of off-island adoption to private owners and contraceptives. The researchers recommended that contraceptive use be focused on the female members of the herd, due to the high numbers of bachelor stallions.|$|E
5|$|More than 40years {{before the}} {{creation}} of the National Park Service, Yellowstone National Park was established on March 1, 1872, as the world's first national park. Between 1872 and 1886, the park was administered by the Interior Department and was managed by a civilian superintendent with limited resources or legal authority to maintain and protect the park's natural features and wildlife, or to deal with poaching, vandalism and other destructive activities. Over the next decade, special interest groups such as concessionaires, railroad and mining interests attempted to commercialize and privatize park lands. The poorly funded Interior Department was unable to prevent degradation of the park and in some circumstances, was complicit with special interest groups. Senator George Vest led efforts to prevent railroads and other special interests from misusing the resource, and along with other members of Congress believed that only the military could effectively protect the park. A study of the situation and amendments to the Yellowstone Park Act proposed by Senator Vest resulted in the Sundry Civil <b>Appropriations</b> <b>Bill</b> of 1883 which allowed the Interior Department to transfer control of the park to the War Department, thereby protecting Yellowstone from schemes to commercialize the park.|$|E
