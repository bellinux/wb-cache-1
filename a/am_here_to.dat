In his inaugural address, Tillman celebrated his victory, [...] "the citizens of this great commonwealth have {{for the first time in}} its history demanded and obtained for themselves the right to choose her Governor; and I, as the exponent and leader of the revolution which brought about the change, <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> take the solemn oath of office... the triumph of democracy and white supremacy over mongrelism and anarchy, of civilization over barbarism, has been most complete." ...|$|E

On 18 March of the same year, in a Vitry-sur-Seine bar, a man held patrons hostage, then fled to later hold a gun to the head of an Orly Airport French soldier, shouting [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> die in the name of Allah", and was shot dead by the soldier's comrades. On 20 April, a man shot dead French police officer on the Champs-Élysées, and was later shot dead himself.

500|$|General George Washington, {{commander}} in chief of the Continental Army, came to Philadelphia to brief Congress on military affairs. [...] Lafayette met him at a dinner on 5 August 1777; according to Leepson, [...] "the two men bonded almost immediately." [...] Washington was impressed by the young man's enthusiasm and was inclined to think well of a fellow Mason; Lafayette was simply in awe of the commanding general. General Washington took the Frenchman to view his military camp; when Washington expressed embarrassment at its state and that of the troops, Lafayette responded, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> learn, not to teach." [...] He became a member of Washington's staff, although confusion existed regarding his status. Congress regarded his commission as honorary, while he considered himself a full-fledged commander who would be given control of a division when Washington deemed him prepared. Washington told Lafayette that a division would not be possible as he was of foreign birth, but that he would be happy to hold him in confidence as [...] "friend and father".|$|E
500|$|Marburger {{responded to}} {{criticism}} of his support for Bush administration policies in 2004, stating [...] "No one will know my personal positions on issues as long as I am in this job. I <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> {{make sure that the}} science input to policy making is sound and that the executive branch functions properly with respect to its science and technology missions." [...] On the topic of stem cell research, he in 2004 said that stem cells [...] "offer great promise for addressing incurable diseases and afflictions. But I can’t tell you when a fertilized egg becomes sacred. That’s not my job. That’s not a science issue. And so whatever I think about reproductive technology or choice, or whatever, is irrelevant to my job as a science adviser." [...] However, in February 2005, in a speech at the annual conference of the National Association of Science Writers, he stated, [...] "Intelligent design is not a scientific theory.... I don't regard intelligent design as a scientific topic". Also In 2005, he told The New York Times that [...] "global warming exists, and {{we have to do something}} about it." ...|$|E
500|$|When Cruise first meets Nicole Kidman (Dolly Wells), he {{asks her}} to sit down so that he will appear taller. Cruise {{performs}} his [...] "dangling-from-the ceiling routine" [...] from [...] – while in bed with Kidman. Cruise asks Kidman how he can prove he is not gay, and she recommends that they make the film Eyes Wide Shut. Stanley Kubrick is portrayed as a sleazy film director, and the program shows a newspaper headline giving a critical review of Eyes Wide Shut. The show portrays Cruise's relationship with Penélope Cruz, who is seen wearing a mantilla. Travolta introduces Cruise to his third wife Katie Holmes (Laura Patch) who is depicted as a robotic Stepford Wife. [...] "Greetings, Earth Man, I <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> serve you," [...] says Holmes to Cruise upon their first meeting. After Cruise asks Holmes to marry him, she states, [...] "Affirmative". The show makes fun of Cruise's couch jumping incident on The Oprah Winfrey Show. (This spoof is in reference to a 2005 appearance by Cruise on the Oprah program, where he [...] "jumped around the set, hopped onto a couch, fell to one knee and repeatedly professed his love for his new girlfriend.") At the wedding of Cruise and Holmes, an alien bride and groom are displayed {{on the top of}} the couple's wedding cake, and the show spoofs the couple's wedding vows. A voiceover at the end of the program tells the viewer to visit scientologyisgreat.com and purchase £4,000 worth of books.|$|E

The Confederate gunnery was described by the Federal commander as “efficient and accurate firing ... great precision, not only at our batteries, but even at the individual persons passing between them.” ...|$|E

In June 1876, Dyson threw a card into the garden of Peace's house, reading: [...] "Charles Peace is requested not to interfere with my family." [...] On 1 July, Peace approached Mrs Dyson and threatened to blow out her brains and those of her husband. Dyson took out a summons against Peace, {{and moved to a}} different suburb, Banner Cross.

2500|$|Henry Morton Stanley {{had been}} sent to find him by the New York Herald {{newspaper}} in 1869. He found Livingstone in the town of Ujiji on the shores of Lake Tanganyika on 10 November 1871, greeting him with the now famous words [...] "Dr. Livingstone, I presume?" [...] Livingstone responded, [...] "Yes", and then [...] "I feel thankful that I <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> welcome you." [...] These famous words may have been a fabrication, as Stanley later tore out the pages of this encounter in his diary. Even Livingstone's account of this encounter does not mention these words. However, the phrase appears in a New York Herald editorial dated 10 August 1872, and the Encyclopædia Britannica and the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography both quote it without questioning its veracity. The words are famous because of their perceived humor, Livingstone being the only other white person for hundreds of miles. Stanley's book suggests that it was really because of embarrassment, because he did not dare to embrace him.|$|E

Jean made on March 8, 2007, her first visit to Canadian troops taking part in the offensive in Afghanistan; she had earlier expressed her desire to go, but Harper advised against such a trip on the grounds of security concerns, the relevance of which were demonstrated when two attacks were made against Canadian soldiers on the same day the Governor General landed in Kabul. Jean had the arrival timed specifically for International Women's Day, stating: [...] "the women of Afghanistan may face the most unbearable conditions, but they never stop fighting for survival. Of course, we, the rest of the women around the world, took too long to hear the cries of our Afghan sisters, but I <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> tell them that they are no longer alone.

2500|$|In November 1948, {{following}} {{the establishment of}} a Communist regime, {{he was elected to the}} Romanian Academy subsequent to the purge of a large number of members. Roller was part of a wave of new academicians, most of whom were of peripheral importance in their fields but were staunch adherents of communism and ready to act as ideological enforcers. Elected the Academy's Vice President (seconding Traian Săvulescu), he also headed the Section for History, Philosophy, Economics and Law from 1949 to 1955. Roller believed the academy should shift from its former position of [...] "a feudal caste, a closed circle, isolated from the masses and the people's needs" [...] into [...] "a living and active factor in the development of our science and culture". Moreover, he exhorted members, regardless of their specialty, to apply Marxist-Leninist teaching on society and its development, proletarian revolutions, the building of socialism and the victory of communism. When Săvulescu suggested that Academy publications should go uncensored, Roller intervened and reimposed [...] "control", noting: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> supervise and cut out those bits that catch my eye." [...] Even the more traditionalist members of the communist academic establishment were irritated by Roller's interventions. Scholar Mihai Ralea allegedly called him [...] "an incompetent, evil rube".|$|E
