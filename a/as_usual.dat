His first full-length operetta, Orphée aux enfers ("Orpheus in the Underworld"), was presented in October 1858. Offenbach, <b>as</b> <b>usual,</b> spent freely on the production, with scenery by Gustave Doré, lavish costumes, a cast of twenty principals, and a large chorus and orchestra.|$|E

5|$|The boranes (boron {{hydrogen}} compounds) {{and similar}} gaseous compounds are quite poisonous. <b>As</b> <b>usual,</b> {{it is not}} an element that is intrinsically poisonous, but their toxicity depends on structure. The boranes are also highly flammable and require special care when handling. Sodium borohydride presents a fire hazard owing to its reducing nature and the liberation of hydrogen on contact with acid. Boron halides are corrosive.|$|E

5|$|Agathaeromys is {{characterized}} {{mainly on the}} basis of features of the molar teeth. <b>As</b> <b>usual</b> in muroid rodents, there are three molars {{on both sides of the}} upper jaw (referred to as M1, M2, and M3 from front to back) and lower jaw (referred to as m1, m2, and m3). Agathaeromys is generally similar to other oryzomyines, but differs from other genera in a variety of details of the molar crowns. Agathaeromys donovani (M1 length 2.03–2.84 mm) is substantially larger than A.praeuniversitatis (M1 length 1.77–1.94 mm).|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>usual</b> in oryzomyines, 12 ribs are present. The first rib articulates {{with both}} the last {{cervical}} (neck) and first thoracic (chest) vertebrae, a synapomorphy of the Sigmodontinae. The anapophyses, processes {{at the back of}} vertebrae, are absent from the fifth lumbar. Between the second and third caudal vertebrae, hemal arches (small bones) are present with a spinous back border. The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen perforates the distal end of the humerus.|$|E

On the Donegal islands of Arranmore, Gola, Inishfree, Inisbofin and Tory, voting took place on 24 October between 11:00 and 15:00 (11:00 and 19:30 on Arranmore). On 25 October, the Mayo islands of Clare Island, Inishbiggle and Inishturk went to the polls; while the Galway islands of Inishbofin and the Aran Islands voted on 26 October between 07:00 and 22:00.|$|E
5|$|Epiacum is in {{some ways}} a typical Roman fort: inside the wall are {{straight}} roads which cross, a headquarters building (the Praetorium), the commandant's house, a set of barrack blocks for the cohort of auxiliary soldiers, and granaries to store food. Also <b>as</b> <b>usual,</b> there is a bath house and a temple (dedicated by the auxiliaries to the Emperor Caracalla) outside the wall. There is an altar to Mithras and another, as already mentioned, to Hercules.|$|E

Main outcome measures – Choice of Marlboro <b>as</b> a <b>usual</b> brand; choice of Camel <b>as</b> a <b>usual</b> brand. Results – Choice of Marlboro <b>as</b> a <b>usual</b> brand was associated with presence of a Marlboro gift with purchase (p. 05) and negatively associated with {{a greater share of}} exterior advertising voice for Camel (p<. 001). Conclusions – The results are consistent with the notion that Marlboro-specific advertising and promotions may influence choice of Marlboro <b>as</b> a <b>usual</b> brand to smoke among teens, but results for Camel are mixed and inconclusive. Further research is required to confirm and extend these findings...|$|R

The first five questions for Super Millionaire were worth $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 (the first safe haven), the remaining ten questions were worth $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $100,000 (the second safe haven), $500,000, $1,000,000, $2,500,000, $5,000,000, and $10,000,000.|$|E
