50|$|Cover {{near the}} ground is an {{important}} criterion for white-throated woodrat shelter sites. In northern portions of their range, white-throated woodrats tend to construct houses <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> trees; in southern portions of their range, white-throated woodrats tend to construct houses <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> shrub-trees, shrubs, or cacti. When available, rocks are preferred by white-throated woodrats for shelter because they provide more protection from variations in ambient temperature than <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> plants.|$|R
50|$|Areas {{where it}} is exposed include <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} San Gabriel Mountains and northwestern San Bernardino Mountains, and in the Cajon Pass between them.|$|R
50|$|Flowers of A. ponderosa are {{polygamous}} {{and form}} cymes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> leaves. They are 6 mm in diameter; the five sepals are 1.5 mm and cover five 0.75 mm petals.|$|R

2500|$|The {{input stage}} {{consists}} of a cascaded differential amplifier (outlined in blue) followed by a current-mirror active load. [...] This constitutes a transconductance amplifier, turning a differential voltage signal <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> Q1, Q2 into a current signal into <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Q15.|$|R
50|$|Found growing amongst {{sandstone}} outcrops, hillsides and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> ridges in <b>the</b> Kimberley {{region of}} Western Australia in skeletal soils. The {{range of the}} plant extends across the top end of the Northern Territory and into western Queensland.|$|R
40|$|A parietal {{yolk sac}} {{carcinoma}} of the mouse that secretes large quantities of basement membrane-like material {{has been used to}} study the formation of basement membranes. Suitably characterized fluorescein-labeled antibodies against this material stained basement membranes of epithelial structures and vessels, as well as reticulin. When absorbed with reticulin and vascular basement membranes of the spleen until these structures no longer fluoresced, the antibody still stained the basement membrane-like material of the tumor, its normal embryonic counterpart (Reichert's membrane), and <b>the</b> basement membranes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> epithelial cells. <b>The</b> observation made previously that parietal yolk sac cells secreted, in the absence of connective tissue and reticulin, the basement membrane (Reichert's membrane) upon which they rested has been confirmed through the localization of ferritin-labeled antibody to the endoplasmic reticulin of the secreting cells. Since a basement membrane proven to be an epithelial secretion is antigenically similar to basement membranes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> all epithelial cells studied but antigenically different from connective tissue elements, it is postulated that <b>the</b> basement membranes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> epithelial cells in general are an epithelial secretion, and are not a condensation of ground substance as is commonly believed...|$|R
5|$|Altar 2 {{was found}} in the West Plaza, where it was {{associated}} with Stela 3 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Structure 3. Altar 2 was a plain monument and had been moved from its original location.|$|E
5|$|Altar 35 is a plain {{monument}} {{associated with}} Stela 43. The stela-altar pair is centrally located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the stairway of Temple IV.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} pathology was {{noticed by}} Parks, and {{from around the}} notch. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth vertebrae, directly anterior to the notch, the neural spines were damaged. The fourth had an obvious fracture, {{with the other two}} possessing a swelling <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the break.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the sign}} {{experienced}} more wear in early 2017, thanks to uneven erosion <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three Os {{from hundreds of}} thousands of posing feet from passersby, primarily to take selfies and other photos, exposing the black rubber padding underneath.|$|R

2500|$|Under no climatic {{conditions}} does {{the grain of}} this species shed its seed when ripe, and even in threshing {{it is not possible}} to separate the grains, as the spikelets break off <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glumes, the grains remaining firmly enclosed between the chaff scales.|$|R
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the Marcellus, in the pyrite-carbonate bed {{between the}} {{carbonaceous}} black shale {{and a green}} calcareous shale bed, pyrite, carbonate, and groundwater reacted to form gossan iron oxide and gypsum.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the tentacles in {{some species}} lie acrorhagi, {{elongated}} inflatable tentacle-like organs armed with cnidocytes, that can flail around and fend off other encroaching anemones; {{one or both}} anemones can be driven off or suffer injury in such battles.|$|E
5|$|Battlements {{were most}} often found surmounting curtain {{walls and the}} tops of gatehouses, and {{comprised}} several elements: crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks {{on top of a}} wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at, or drop objects on, attackers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Machicolations were stone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the wall in a similar fashion to hoardings.|$|E
25|$|US {{troops would}} remain {{in the area around}} La Rochelle, within the dispositions of <b>the</b> Atlantic Alliance, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> La Rochelle, Croix-Chapeau, Bussac-Forêt, and Saint-Jean-d'Angély (Fontenet) until 1966, when Charles de Gaulle withdrew France from the {{military}} wing of NATO, and ordered <b>the</b> closure <b>of</b> NATO <b>bases</b> in France.|$|R
50|$|Basal or basilar {{crackles}} (not to {{be confused}} with the basilar artery of the brain) are crackles apparently originating in or near <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lung. Bibasal or bibasilar crackles refer to crackles <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> left and right lungs. Bilateral basal crackles also refers to the presence of basal crackles in both lungs.|$|R
50|$|Aegialomys {{species have}} a greyish to buff dorsal pelage which is divided sharply {{from the white}} to light yellow ventral pelage. They have {{relatively}} short ears. There are crowns <b>of</b> hair <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> toes. The tail is equal to or longer than the body and is darker above than below.|$|R
5|$|Below the Solsville, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the Otsego {{in eastern}} New York, a coral bed is found; another coral bed {{can be seen}} {{at the top of the}} Marcellus near Berne, New York.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{the hollow}} took {{the shape of}} a large bowl {{in the side of the}} mountain, with the {{headwall}} being weathered by constant freezing and thawing, and eroded by plucking. The basin became deeper (especially <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the headwall) as it continued to be eroded by abrasion.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum pectinatum {{has been}} mistaken for the morphologically similar but smaller species G.schmidelii. The latter species lacks {{vertical}} striations on the basal {{portions of the}} endoperidium, and {{does not have a}} pseudoparenchymatous collar around the stem. Another similar species, G.berkeleyi, has a shorter stem and is missing the ridges <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the spore sac. Further, the color of its spore sac is usually brown, in contrast to the gray-blue of G.pectinatum. G.xerophilum also has a dusting of white powder {{on the surface of the}} spore sac, but unlike G.pectinatum, consistently lacks a ring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the pedicel; furthermore, in contrast to G.pectinatum, the spores of G.xerophilum are yellow and contain oil drops that are readily observable with a microscope. G.striatum has smaller fruit bodies than G.pectinatum, and a distinct collar-like apophysis.|$|E
50|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> Plants and the Zombies, {{there are}} several common features, {{including}} a Customization Room allowing the player to change and accessorize characters, a Quest Board with different objectives for Plants, Multiplayer, and Zombies, sticker Shops, a Multiplayer Portal, a Mailbox, and a special Garage, with quest missions for both sides.|$|R
25|$|A current signal i at Q15's base {{gives rise}} to a current in Q19 of order i * β2 (the product of the hfe of each of Q15 and Q19, which are {{connected}} in a Darlington pair). This current signal develops a voltage <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> output transistors Q14/Q20 proportional to the hie of the respective transistor.|$|R
