5|$|The ballad, The Mermaid of Padstow, tells {{a similar}} story of a local named Tom Yeo, who shot the mermaid mistaking her for a seal. John Betjeman, who was well-acquainted with the area, wrote in 1969 that the mermaid met a local man {{and fell in love}} with him. When she could no longer bear living without him, she tried to lure him beneath the waves but he escaped by {{shooting}} her. In her rage she threw a handful of sand towards Padstow, around which the sandbank grew. In other versions of the tale, the mermaid sings from the rocks and a youth shoots <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> crossbow, or a greedy man shoots her with a longbow. Mermaids were believed to sing to their victims so that they can lure adulterers to their death.|$|E
500|$|Aleppine {{historian}} Muhammad Raghib al-Tabbakh {{wrote that}} she was unique in Aleppo, and that [...] "people looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> different eye". Although she had many suitors, she initially wished to remain single. However, she was persuaded to marry after her mother's death, and chose for husband Habib Ghadban, a scion of a local Christian family. They had one son and two daughters.|$|E
500|$|A woman (Lenora Crichlow) {{wakes up}} in a house and realizes she has amnesia. She is {{surrounded}} by images of a small girl (Imani Jackman)—whom she assumes is her daughter—as well as photos of herself and a man (Nick Ofield) and also by a television signal. She leaves the house and notices several people recording her on their phones who ignore her pleas for help. A masked man arrives and opens fire <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> shotgun. She flees and meets Jem (Tuppence Middleton) and Damien (Ian Bonar). Jem and the woman escape the masked man, who kills Damien. Jem explains that a mysterious signal began appearing on television and over the Internet, {{while most of the}} population turned into passive voyeurs who do nothing but record everything around them. The woman and Jem are unaffected, but they are also a target for the [...] "hunters", unaffected humans who act sadistically. Jem plans to reach a transmitter at [...] "White Bear" [...] to destroy it and stop the signal's effect on the area.|$|E

2500|$|In the season's final episode, Roseanne {{reveals the}} entire series itself is {{actually}} a story written by Roseanne Conner about her life. To cope, Roseanne twisted major elements of her life for the story, which the audience does not discover until the final moments of the series. In reality, Dan's heart attack {{near the end of}} Season 8 was fatal and the Conner family did not win the lottery. [...] A story arc which runs through the final season, was that Dan betrayed Roseanne by having an affair. [...] We learn that Dan's betrayal wasn't by having an affair, but by dying. [...] Tough Roseanne, who could always take the worst life could throw <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> laugh, could not handle Dan's death. [...] Also, Jackie is a lesbian and Beverly is straight. Scott is a probate lawyer that Roseanne befriended, and set up with Leon—who she claims isn't very hip like she wrote him to be. Another difference is that Mark and Darlene were a couple all along, as were David and Becky, rather than the opposite (Becky with Mark and Darlene with David).|$|E
60|$|He {{stood looking}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> kind of desperate irresolution.|$|E

60|$|The Honorable Freddie {{raised a}} flushed face and gazed <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> absent eye.|$|R
60|$|He {{laughed a}} long, cruel laugh, and looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> evil leer, up and down.|$|R
60|$|Gabriel looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little {{surprise}} and much admiration.|$|E
60|$|Benham looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{slightly}} hostile intelligence, {{and said}} nothing.|$|E
60|$|Cyril {{gazed down}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> very regretful and {{sympathetic}} face.|$|E
60|$|She covered <b>her</b> face <b>with</b> <b>her</b> hands, while Cothope looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{expression}} between {{suspicion and}} impatience.|$|R
6000|$|Again his astonishment was obvious; and {{he looked}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{expression}} of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on: ...|$|R

60|$|She resented his {{laughing}} <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> obstinate {{shake of}} her head, and an angry knitting of her pretty eyebrows.|$|R
6000|$|... "Och, Miss Bounder!" [...] exclaimed Dan, looking <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{expression}} so awfully reproachful that cook instantly repented and laughed.|$|R
60|$|Again we paused. I {{looked up}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> inextricable medley of {{emotions}} struggling together in my mind, {{and shook my}} head.|$|R
60|$|Her words carried no conviction. He looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new suspicion.|$|E
60|$|Brooks {{leaned against}} the table and looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> puzzled smile.|$|E
60|$|Sewell made no disclaimer, but {{he looked}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> curious intensity.|$|E
60|$|An {{idea here}} struck Cissy {{which made her}} heart jump and her cheeks flame. Ah Fe gazed <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{infantile}} smile of admiration.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I were {{inclined}} to joke, I should say, How much this seems like Paradise!" [...] he remarked whimsically, looking <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> inclined head.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Her</b> sister, <b>at</b> this, looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{extraordinary}} cold gravity. 'Don't interfere {{between me}} and my children. And for God's sake cease to harry me!' ...|$|R

60|$|The {{man looked}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> flicker of grim {{amusement}} in his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "You like me for it?" [...] And Lord Warburton looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{uncertain}} eye. [...] "I {{think you}} mean you're {{laughing at me}} for it." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{father looked}} up <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intimate, half-gallant, half-impudent, but wistful look. His captive soul loved her: but his soul was captive, he knew, always.|$|R
60|$|James Harthouse looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> incredulous smile {{upon his}} lips; but her mind {{looked over and}} beyond him, and the smile was quite thrown away.|$|R
