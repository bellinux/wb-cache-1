[...] Unlike contemporaries such as Jefferson, who considered the removal of freed slaves (to a western territory, the West Indies, or Africa) to be essential to any plan for emancipation, Hamilton pressed for emancipation with no such provisions. Hamilton and other Federalists supported Toussaint Louverture's revolution against France in Haiti, which had originated as a slave revolt. Hamilton's suggestions helped shape the Haitian constitution, and when Haiti became the Western Hemisphere's first independent black nation in 1804, Hamilton urged closer economic and diplomatic ties.|$|E

500|$|In 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, {{entitled}} [...] "J.A.R.". The single debuted {{at number}} one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by the band's fourth studio album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response to the band's newfound popularity, compared to the more melodic Dookie. The album opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said [...] "In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> this stuff gets."

Kitty Empire of The Guardian said, [...] "Madonna’s interludes <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> the main event", and that the performance of [...] "Illuminati" [...] "finds seven dancers strapped to the top of tall, flexible poles, swaying precipitously". The Hollywood Reporter Ashley Lee said, [...] "Madonna's dancers served impressive spectacles that left the crowd gasping in awe, as they leaned wildly into the audience from atop ten-foot stilts. It's arguable that her changeover dance sequences and stunts are more entertaining than other performers' entire sets." [...] The performance at the March 19-20, 2016 shows in Sydney's Allphones Arena was recorded and released in Madonna's fifth live album, Rebel Heart Tour.|$|E

They <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> a team as we have played." [...] On Boxing Day, Henry scored twice for Arsenal in a 3–0 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Three days later, the team played Southampton. The only goal of the match came in the first half: Henry's through pass found Pirès [...] "who slid the ball beneath the exposed Antti Niemi". The win meant Arsenal had gone half the season without losing and the team according to The Times had begun to [...] "establish an aura of invincibility". Arsenal ended the calendar year in second place, with 45 points from 19 matches. They were one point behind leaders Manchester United and three ahead of Chelsea.|$|E

500|$|During pre-season, {{ahead of}} the 2006–07 campaign, May injured his {{shoulder}} in training, resulting in him missing the club's pre-season tour of Iceland. Millwall manager Nigel Spackman revealed that May's injury would rule {{him out of the}} first two months of the season — [...] "He fell over during the close season, and it looks like {{he is going to be}} out for a couple of months". He made his first appearance of the season in October 2006, coming on as a second-half substitute in Millwall's 2–0 home win against Bournemouth in the Football League Trophy, scoring Millwall's second goal with his first touch of the game. In his first start of the season, he scored after six minutes in the club's 2–1 FA Cup win against Havant & Waterlooville in a game played at Fratton Park, netting from close range after good work from Chris Hackett. Five days later, he provided the assist for Darren Byfield's goal in a 2–2 home draw with Doncaster Rovers. May scored his third goal in five appearances when he scored in Millwall's 3–1 loss at Nottingham Forest on 24 November 2006. After Millwall's 2–0 home win against Bradford City, a game in which May assisted Filipe Morais in scoring Millwall's first goal, Millwall manager Willie Donachie stated — [...] "There's more to come from this team, especially Darren Byfield and Ben May, who <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> anyone in this league. They're committed, honest players who want to work for each other". Three days later, on 12 December 2006, May's pacey cross resulted in Nathan Doyle putting the ball into his own net, giving Millwall a 1–0 win against Bradford City after extra-time in the FA Cup. May scored the only goal of the game in a 1–0 victory at Yeovil Town on 3 February 2007, converting Darren Byfield's cross to give Millwall the three points. However, he was substituted after 53 minutes in the same game with an ankle injury, and in March 2007, he was ruled out of first-team action for the rest of the 2006–07 season. Despite this, he made a second-half substitute appearance on the last day of the season in a 2–2 draw at Bradford City, assisting Darren Byfield's goal just after coming on. May scored four times in 19 appearances in a season disrupted by injuries.|$|E

2500|$|Only Built 4 Cuban Linx… {{was well}} {{received}} by contemporary critics. The Source magazine's Nicholas Poluhoff said [...] "Raekwon has always brought his own special flavor to the Wu cipher: he sprays out lyrics like gunfire, forming vivid tales. What truly sets Cuban Linx apart is the sheer abundance of well-written, complex lyrics." [...] Poluhoff also praised RZA's production, viewing {{it as his}} best yet: [...] "The tracks are suited to the distinct flow of the Chef, who weaves in and out between beats." [...] Cheo H. Choker from Spin magazine found Raekwon to be as vivid a lyricist as Kool G Rap, [...] "so vivid you smell the gunpowder and wipe the blood on your shirt", while crediting RZA for [...] "taking the art form of production to new heights". Los Angeles Times said the songs with other Wu-Tang Clan members <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> anything on Enter the 36 Chambers and wrote of the music: [...] "RZA's production sensibilities, sometimes minimal, other times symphonic, pull the listener in despite the chaos. In a genre characterized by singles, Cuban Linx is a full-blown album where the big picture is just as moving as the compositional stylistic elements." [...] In Vibe magazine, dream hampton was impressed by Raekwon and Ghostface Killah's use of cultural appropriation in their lyrics and said they [...] "bring the best in each other." ...|$|E
2500|$|Polgár {{has rarely}} played in women's-specific tournaments or {{divisions}} {{and has never}} competed for the Women's World Championship: [...] "I always say that women should have the self-confidence that they <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> male players, {{but only if they}} are willing to work and take it seriously as much as male players." [...] While László Polgár has been credited with being an excellent chess coach, the Polgárs had also employed professional chessplayers to train their daughters, including Hungarian champion IM Tibor Florian, GM Pal Benko, and Russian GM Alexander Chernin. Susan Polgár, the eldest of the sisters, 5½ years older than Sophia and 7 years older than Judit, {{was the first of the}} sisters to achieve prominence in chess by winning tournaments, and by 1986, she was the world's top-rated female chess player. Initially, being the youngest, Judit was separated from her sisters while they were in training. However, this only served to increase Judit's curiosity. After learning the rules, they discovered Judit was able to find solutions to the problems they were studying, and she began to be invited into the group. One evening, Susan was studying an endgame with their trainer, a strong International Master. Unable to find the solution, they woke Judit, who was asleep in bed and carried her into the training room. Still half asleep, Judit showed them how to solve the problem, after which they put her back to bed. László Polgár's experiment would produce a family of one international master and two grandmasters and would strengthen the argument for nurture over nature, but also prove women could be grandmasters of chess.|$|E
2500|$|The two songwriters of the Smiths {{cited the}} band; singer Morrissey said that [...] "Siouxsie and the Banshees were excellent", and that [...] "they {{were one of}} the great groups of the late 70s, early 80s".

That's not dusty nostalgia, that's fact". Guitarist Johnny Marr, mentioned his liking for Banshees guitarist John McGeoch and his contribution to the single [...] "Spellbound". Marr qualified it as [...] "clever" [...] with a [...] "really good picky thing going on which is very un-rock'n'roll". U2 cited Siouxsie and the Banshees as a major influence and selected [...] "Christine" [...] for a Mojo compilation. The Edge was the presenter of an award given to Siouxsie at the Mojo ceremony in 2005. In December 1981, Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode named the Banshees as one of his three favourite bands along with Sparks and Roxy Music. Gahan later hailed the single [...] "Candyman" [...] at its release, saying, [...] "This is a great Banshees record, I like their sound". Jim Reid of the Jesus and Mary Chain selected [...] "Jigsaw Feeling" [...] from The Scream as being among his favourite songs. Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth cited [...] "Hong Kong Garden" [...] in his top 25 all-time favourite songs, and Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine also mentioned them as being among his early influences. Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction once noted a parallel between his band and the Banshees: [...] "There are so many similar threads: melody, use of sound, attitude, sex-appeal. I always saw Jane's Addiction as the masculine Siouxsie and the Banshees". Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie liked the group's ability to produce pop songs while transmitting something subversive. He said, [...] "They were outsiders bringing outsider subjects to the mainstream. We’re not trying to rip off the Banshees, but that's kind of where we’re coming from".|$|E
