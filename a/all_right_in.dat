500|$|After Mott {{opened the}} meeting, {{the minutes of}} the {{previous}} day were read, and Stanton presented the Declaration of Sentiments. In regard to the grievance [...] "He has taken from her <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> property, even to the wages she earns," [...] Assemblyman Ansel Bascom stood {{to say that he}} had recently been at the New York State Assembly which passed the Married Woman's Property Act. Bascom spoke at length about the property rights it secured for married women, including property acquired after marriage. Further discussion of the Declaration ensued, including comments by Frederick Douglass, Thomas and Mary Ann M'Clintock, and Amy Post; the document was adopted unanimously. The question of men's signatures was solved by having two sections of signatures, one for women followed by one for men. One hundred of the 300 present signed the Declaration of Sentiments, including 68 women and 32 men. Amelia Bloomer was one of the participants who did not endorse the Declaration; she was focused at that time on the temperance movement. Ansel Bascom was the most conspicuous attendee who chose not to sign the Declaration. The National Reformer reported that those in the audience who evidently regarded the Declaration as [...] "too bold and ultra", including the lawyers known to be opposed to the equal rights of women, [...] "failed to call out any opposition, except in a neighboring BAR-ROOM." ...|$|E

2500|$|Of course, {{the other}} {{communities}} trying to attract {{what would become}} Northern Illinois University were not so impressed. A July 1895 editorial in the Oregon Republican complained, [...] "Just where this fish came from is unknown, but it looked haggard and footsore, like it had tramped a long distance. There is some talk of stocking the Kish with salt-cured cod. They stand the pressure <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> either a wet or dry season." [...] The committee paid it no mind and DeKalb was accepted as a finalist to be the host site for the new college.

Sebastian stated {{in an interview with}} the Sunday Telegraph, [...] "They were originally just going to release The Memphis Album, but I don't want to be known as a covers artist here. It was <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> Australia, because it was my fourth album, but I want some originals on there."

2500|$|While the Gadhar ramifications {{extended}} widely, in May 1913, Kumar sailed from San Francisco for the Philippine Islands.

Professor Barakatullah is <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> Japan." [...] (Ker, p237). According to Ker’s report, [...] "he was engaged in supervising {{the work of the}} Ghadr Party in the Far East. Amongst the correspondence of Harnam Singh of Sahri were several letters from G.D. Kumar showing that he was working hard on behalf of the cause. He was in constant touch with Bhagwan Singh and Barakatullah and was collecting money for the Ghadr campaign and was sending to Har Dayal. He afterwards went to Japan, where he busied himself meeting Ghadr parties passing through Yokohama on the way to India." [...] (p425).|$|E
2500|$|During the {{parliament}} Cokayne was accused {{by a group}} of four feoffees of violently seizing the manor of Baddesley Ensor in Warwickshire. The accusers included figures of the greatest importance in the realm: Lawrence Allerthorpe, a former Lord High Treasurer, William Gascoigne, the Chief Justice, Robert Waterton, one of a long-serving family of Lancastrian retainers who held the key manor and castle of Pontefract for the dynasty and had played a key part in Bolingbroke's return to England, and John West. They claimed that Cokayne had entered the manor with deux centz gentz arraiez a faire de guerre: 200 men dressed for warfare. The king ordered him to appear before his council at Westminster the following May. The Harthill family had held land at Baddesley Ensor since the late 13th century, when Richard de Hertewell, still a minor, is mentioned as an heir to Thomas de Edensor, the previous and eponymous lord of the manor. Sir Richard Harthill, Cokayne's maternal grandfather, made various settlements of land at the manor, some of them slightly mysterious, before his death. Secondary sources appear to minimise the issue. The History of Parliament avers that Sir John escaped punishment because of the [...] "proven validity of his claim to the property, which his mother had recently inherited," [...] while the Victoria County History maintains that he [...] "may merely have been too previous in his entry, as in 1417 Elizabeth, widow of Edmund Cokayn, daughter and heir of Richard de Herthill, released to John Cokayn, her son, <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> the manor." [...] The manor formed part of the patrimony of Elizabeth, Sir John Cokayne's mother, and was retained by her throughout her lifetime. She did not voluntarily release it to Sir John: 1417, when it was quitclaimed to her son with the rest of her estates, was the year after her death. It is unclear whether Sir John was acting in his own or his mother's interests, but past behaviour shows that he was not averse to using armed force to dispossess women. If he had a right to the property, it is unclear why he needed to use an armed force of 200 to occupy it. Clearly he did not prevail, even if he did avoid punishment, as the manor did not fall into his hands for more than decade.|$|E
2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E
