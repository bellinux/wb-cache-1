5000|$|<b>Analog</b> <b>watch</b> (American) or {{analogue}} watch (UK & Commonwealth) {{is an example}} of a retronym. It was coined to distinguish analog watches, which had simply been called [...] "watches", from newer digital watches; see watch and clock.|$|E
5000|$|... 24-hour <b>analog</b> <b>watches</b> and clocks {{are still}} being {{manufactured}} today, and are sought after by collectors and enthusiasts. A famous brand is the Glycine Airman watch. Other manufacturers who make 24-hour <b>analog</b> <b>watches</b> include Breitling, Raketa, Vostok, Fortis, Poljot, Swatch, and many others.|$|R
5000|$|Advances in {{technology}} are often {{responsible for the}} coinage of retronyms. For example, the term [...] "acoustic guitar" [...] was coined at the advent of electric guitars and <b>analog</b> <b>watches</b> were thus named to distinguish them from digital watches.|$|R
50|$|Tsovet {{began with}} Bonaventura's {{interest}} in metal fabrication and mechanical gauges. Tsovet's <b>analog</b> <b>watches</b> {{are inspired by}} engineered industrial tools, retro motor gauges, and avionics instruments. Bonaventura designs the watches and uses quartz and automatic movements imported from Switzerland.|$|R
50|$|A {{tachymeter}} tuh- {{scale is}} a scale sometimes inscribed {{around the rim}} of an <b>analog</b> <b>watch.</b> It {{can be used to}} compute a speed based on travel time or measure distance based on speed. The spacings between the marks on the tachymeter dial are therefore proportional to 1/t where t is the elapsed time.|$|E
5000|$|A digital {{watch is}} one in which the time is {{displayed}} as a series of digits, e.g. [...] "13:37". An <b>analog</b> <b>watch</b> {{is one in}} which the display is not digital, but is indicated (typically) by the continuous motion of one, two, or three rotating pointers or hands pointing to numbers arrayed on a circular dial (the hour hand's movement being analogous to the path of the Sun across the sky).|$|E
50|$|Unlike its predecessors, {{the display}} of the USB series {{features}} full dot matrix architecture with no seven segment display sections. Only a small section at the top right corner uses a nine-segment display layout. Many programs have been developed, and their applications include video games, screen savers, golf score keepers, watch display contrast and scrolling speed adjustment, as well as <b>analog</b> <b>watch</b> displays, phase of the moon calculations and associated display graphics and others. The wristapps are written in assembly language.|$|E
5000|$|Swatch was {{originally}} intended to re-capture entry level market share lost by Swiss manufacturers during the quartz crisis and the subsequent growth of Japanese companies such as Seiko and Citizen in the 1960s and 1970s, and to re-popularize <b>analog</b> <b>watches</b> {{at a time when}} digital watches had achieved wide popularity.|$|R
5000|$|There are notable non-electrical analog devices, such as clocks (sundials, water clocks, {{pendulum}} clocks, <b>analog</b> <b>watches),</b> the astrolabe, slide rules, {{the governor}} of a steam engine, the planimeter (a simple device that measures the area of a closed shape), Kelvin's mechanical tide predictor, acoustic rangefinders, servomechanisms (e.g. the thermostat), a simple mercury thermometer, a bathroom scale, and the speedometer ...|$|R
50|$|HMT set up {{additional}} {{manufacturing facilities}} to produce watch components sets at Tumkur and Ranibagh {{in the year}} 1978 and 1985 respectively. Watch factory at Tumkur was partially converted to manufacture Quartz <b>Analog</b> <b>Watches</b> in collaboration with M/S Citizen Watch Co, Japan. To cater to the Niche market, a specialised watch case manufacturing facility was set up at Bangalore in 1983.|$|R
50|$|An <b>analog</b> <b>watch</b> has {{hands to}} show the time. One for the hours is short and thick. One for the minutes is long and thin. And {{sometimes}} one for the seconds which is long and very thin, this is clearly the second hand because it goes round 60 {{times faster than the}} minute hand and 720 times faster than the hour hand.Some Analog watches don't have numbers printed onto them. The numbers can be determined because the strap is always at 12 & 6. Often only the 12 o'clock position is marked, or only the 12, 3, 6 & 9 positions.|$|E
50|$|An <b>analog</b> <b>watch</b> {{can be used}} {{to locate}} north and south. The Sun appears to move in the sky over a 24-hour period while the hour hand of a 12-hour clock face takes twelve hours to {{complete}} one rotation. In the northern hemisphere, if the watch is rotated so that the hour hand points toward the Sun, the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate south. For this method to work in the southern hemisphere, the 12 is pointed toward the Sun and the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate north. During daylight saving time, the same method can be employed using 1 o'clock instead of 12.|$|E
5000|$|Martian Watches are {{produced}} in several styles, each with an analog time display, a small OLED display screen, a speaker, and a noise-cancelling microphone. The small OLED displays scrolling text which can show caller ID information, text messages, {{and other information}} such as social media notifications. In addition, the watch {{can be used to}} trigger the shutter of the mobile phone's camera. [...] The watches utilize Bluetooth 4.0, which supports regular Bluetooth, as well as Bluetooth low energy. The <b>analog</b> <b>watch</b> portion of Martian Watches is powered by a watch battery, and there is a side mounted micro USB port for the rechargeable battery that handles the phone functions, in addition to an accelerometer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Analog</b> <b>watches</b> {{as well as}} clocks {{are often}} marketed showing a display time of {{approximately}} 1:50 or 10:10. This creates a visually pleasing smile-like face on upper half of the watch, in addition to enclosing the manufacturer's name. Digital displays often show a time of 12:08, where {{the increase in the}} number of active segments or pixels gives a positive feeling.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the 1950s, {{competitive}} swimmers {{relied on}} {{the sound of a}} starting pistol to start their races and mechanical stopwatches to record their times {{at the end of a}} race. Unfortunately, these <b>analog</b> <b>watches</b> could not record times accurately beyond one tenth (0.1) of a second. The invention of automatic timing systems brought more accuracy and credibility to aquatic sports.|$|R

40|$|We often {{forget how}} fast things change; for example, {{my father was}} born {{at a time when}} a wagon ride to the major city center 50 miles away took half a day {{and by the time he}} died almost a century later he could travel across a major ocean and {{traverse}} a continent in the same time. Those of us old enough to recall having to literally cut and paste together edits on our work know that the “cut ” and “paste ” features on most word pro-cessing software is a reference that most undergraduates cannot understand in their literal sense. My teenage son recently saw a rotary phone in a communication museum and pondered how you make a call, and it is only recently that he has become comfort-able with telling time on an <b>analog</b> <b>watch</b> (who knows what he makes of old war films with “bandits at four o’clock ” – is that a reference to some appointment or anticipation?). In much the same way we get wrapped up in current debates and discussions over globalization, the internationalization of production, and the spread of capitalism as it penetrates all corners of the globe.

50|$|<b>Analog</b> diving <b>watches</b> {{must have}} a water {{resistant}} crown. Some models have the crown mounted in unconventional positions like 4, 8 or 9 o'clock to avert or reduce discomfort from the crown touching the wearers (left) wrist or back of the hand. Often the crown has to be unscrewed to set or adjust the time and date and afterwards retightened to restore the water resistance of the watch and minimize the chance of unintentional operation under water. There are also watch models where a locking handle, separate knob or an extra crown cover has to be manipulated before the crown can be operated. There are however models that have crowns that are operated like the crowns of non diver's <b>analog</b> <b>watches.</b> Screw down or otherwise locking crowns and traditionally operated water resistant crowns can not be operated under water.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} know how to use a {{tachymeter}} to help with measuring speed and distance traveled, {{it is important to know}} what a tachymeter is. Tachymeter Definition The circular dial seen on many watches is called a tachymeter. It is only installed on <b>analog</b> <b>watches</b> and has a variety of useful functions. The tiny dials and buttons on the sides of the watch operate the measuring scale. The tachymeter is a scale that measures speed. It also has the ability to measure distance travelled and at which speed it was traveled. The scale on this watch design has also been known to be used as a way to measure industrial production lines. To do this, the tachymeter can measure this at units processed per hour. The aim of its design and overall function is to use elapsed time and transfer it into speed. To illustrate, seconds for each unit into units processed each hour. This particular function can also be utilized as a stop watch for races. Watch Designs Watches with this type of scale are often made with stainless steel and come in different colors such as with a rose gold watch strap or even a stainless watch face with nato-style watch bands...|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s {{and early}} 1980s, the American watch and clock {{industry}} was {{devastated by the}} arrival of cheap mechanical watches from the Far East, as well as the development of digital quartz watches pioneered by Japanese companies. Lehmkuhl retired in 1973 with no clear successor. Polaroid ended its contract with Timex in 1975 resulting in a layoff of 2,000 employees. New technology, in the form of electronic digital <b>watches</b> and quartz <b>analog</b> <b>watches,</b> was developing very rapidly, making Timex's mechanical watchmaking production facilities obsolete. Timex closed and consolidated worldwide operations, cutting the 30,000 employee workforce to 6,000. New competition, including Japanese companies, low-cost Hong Kong producers and large American companies such as Gillette, Texas Instruments and National Semi-Conductor were aggressively entering the business. The Disney license had expired and John Cameron Swayze retired from his role as spokesperson. The subcontracting business was rebuilt with new customers such as IBM, Hugin-Sweda and General Electric. In a joint venture with Sinclair Research Ltd., the company entered the home computer business, selling such computers as the Timex Sinclair 1000 and succeeding machines, modeled on the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum. In 1984 after declining sales amid a bruising price war with Commodore Business Machines, the company decided not to compete in that market any longer.|$|R
50|$|There {{are some}} <b>analog</b> dive <b>watches</b> {{available}} with a GMT complication. GMT watches {{were designed for}} long-haul aircrew and other users who want to track time in different time zones. These watches have an additional GMT watch hand {{and in the case}} of diving watches can have a rotating bezel with 24-hours markings instead of minute markings used for reading of elapsed time. With the help of the GMT hand and a correctly adjusted 24-hours bezel the time in two different time zones can be easily read without having to perform arithmetic.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{development}} of the Cox Box by Nielsen-Kellerman, a megaphone strapped {{to the head of the}} coxswain was used to make the coxswain easier to hear, and the coxswain used an <b>analog</b> stop <b>watch</b> and rate watch - quite a handful when also trying to steer a 60' long racing shell! The use of a system with multiple speakers also became much more important when racing eight construction switched to sealed bulkhead sections to ensure the boat would remain safely buoyant even when damaged. This is because sound could no longer travel down the hull as was possible with the previous open style of construction.|$|R
50|$|This {{is similar}} to a hybrid tuner, except there are two {{separate}} tuners on the card. One can <b>watch</b> <b>analog</b> while recording digital, or vice versa. The card operates as an analog tuner and a digital tuner simultaneously. The advantages over two separate cards are cost and utilization of expansion slots in the computer. As many regions around the world convert from analog to digital broadcasts, these tuners are gaining popularity.|$|R
