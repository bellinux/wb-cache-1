40|$|A novel gas-phase electrophilic cyclization, {{initiated}} by the protonation of <b>a</b> <b>nitro</b> <b>group,</b> occurs for 2 -nitrophenyl phenyl ether and for the analogous sulfide and amine, leading to heterocyclic intermediates in each case. Subsequently, the cyclic intermediates dissociate via two pathways: (1) unusual step-wise eliminations of two OH radicals to afford heterocyclic cations, [phenoxazine − H]+, [phenothiazine − H]+, and [phenazine + H]+, and (2) expulsion of H 2 O, to yield a heterocyclic ketone, followed by loss of CO. The proposed structures of the gas-phase product ions and reaction mechanisms are supported by chemical substitution, deuterium labeling, accurate mass measurements at high mass resolving power, product-ion mass spectra obtained by tandem mass spectrometry, mass spectra of reference compounds, and molecular orbital calculations.
