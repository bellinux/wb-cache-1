40|$|This {{research}} aims at realising a shutter prototype {{which would}} allow the containment of the summer heating load in non-residential buildings. The prototype will be constructed with glass-block and will overhang the façade. It will be parallelepiped shaped; furthermore, it will have an isosceles section with the larger base positioned {{at the top of}} the hole forming, thus, a plan perpendicular to the façade and overhanging by 0, 40 cm. With its positioning at the height of the envisaged holes and its particular geometrical shape, this prototype will replace the standard vertical shutter with one containing glass-block with a sharp inclination with respect to the incidence of the sun rays in the summer time. A measurement campaign is envisaged in order to optimize the glass inclination with respect to the incidence of the sun rays both during the winter and the summer time and the width of the horizontal <b>anti-dazzle</b> <b>screen</b> placed {{at the top of the}} shutter. The objectives of this research are: - Minimising overheating during the summer through the inclination of the glass surface; - Reaching a high level of visual comfort; - Realising a monitored natural ventilation. The horizontal overhang surfaces of the shutter will be equipped with a series of holes controlled by a system of rotating thin plates which, once positioned vertically, will allow the proper circulation of air and a further source of natural light. Furthermore, the geometrical shape of this prototype allows for the control of te shades; the holes on the higher and lower horizontal surfaces will guarantee a natural ventilation so to ensure the proper level of air moisture. The lack of mobile or steady anti-dazzle screens ensures a perfect view of the external surroundings; in addition to this, the standard levels envisaged for by the existing regulations on natural lighting on the back wall will not be altered. The aim of this work is that of providing a passive element which could concretely guarantee a high level of acoustic and visual comfort, and a proper ventilation in indoor non-residential environments...|$|E
