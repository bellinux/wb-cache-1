40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the work is}} to understand the decomposition of <b>alphacypermethrin</b> {{which is one of the}} most common pyrethroid pesticides, and to examine the formation of pollutants formed during decomposition. This article reports the experimental results of the thermal decomposition of <b>alphacypermethrin</b> under non-oxidative conditions. The experiments were conducted in a tubular reactor at atmospheric pressure. The reaction variables considered were temperature (300 - 600 °C) and flow rate (27. 8 - 18. 2 cm 3 /min) which was adjusted to maintain a residence time of 5 s. The pesticide was slowly vaporised at an evaporation rate of 70 µg/min at a temperature of 185 °C. The decomposition of <b>alphacypermethrin</b> started around 375 °C and involved an unusual vinylcyclopropane rearrangement-cum-aromatisation reaction. At higher temperatures, <b>alphacypermethrin</b> was aromatised into 3 -phenoxyphenyl nitrile acetic acid 3 -mcthyl phenyl ester with the concomitant loss of hydrogen chloride molecules. The presence of hydrogen chloride gas was confirmed by FTJR spectroscopy. Other products detected and quantified by GC/MS were o-toluic acid, 3 -phenoxybenzaldehyde, diphenyl ether, phenoxyphenyl acetonitrile, methyl benzonitrile, phenoxybenzonitrile and phenol. Previous studies carried out on permethrin in our laboratory 'showed that the process of aromatisation was around 20 kcal/mol lower in energy than the direct rupture of the O-CH 2 linkage for temperatures between 400 - 1000 °C. The effect of the CN group in <b>alphacypermethrin</b> compared to permethrin was also investigated by density functional theory (OFT) calculations...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{effectiveness}} of insecticide treated nets is under threat across Africa {{south of the}} Sahara from the selection of pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. To maintain progress against malaria {{it is necessary to}} identify alternative residual insecticides for mosquito nets. Mixtures of pyrethroid and insecticides with novel mode of action provide scope for both improved control and management of resistance through concurrent exposure to unrelated insecticides. Methods: The pyrrole chlorfenapyr and the pyrethroid <b>alphacypermethrin</b> were tested individually and as a mixture on mosquito nets in an experimental hut trial in southern Benin against pyrethroid resistant An gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. The nets were deliberately holed to simulate the effect of wear and tear. Results: The nets treated with the mixture of chlorfenapyr 200 mg/m 2 and <b>alphacypermethrin</b> 25 mg/m 2 killed a proportion of An gambiae (77 %, 95 %CI: 66 – 86 %) significantly greater than nets treated with <b>alphacypermethrin</b> 25 mg/m 2 (30 %, 95 %CI: 21 – 41 %) but not significantly different from nets treated with chlorfenapyr 200 mg/m 2 (69 %, 95 %CI: 57 – 78 %). The nets treated with the mixtures procured personal protection against An gambiae biting(58 – 62 %) by a greater margin than the <b>alphacypermethrin</b> treated net (39 %), whereas the chlorfenapyr treated net was not protective.

40|$|Abstract-A {{formulation}} {{consisting of}} the pyrethroid insecticide <b>alphacypermethrin</b> and flufenoxuron, an acylurea insect growth regulator, {{has been shown to}} give effective and persistent control of cockroach infestations after a single treatment. Flufenoxuron is a new high performance residual insecticide for public hygiene pest control which kills insects by interference with chitin formation. Failure of the chitin to develop properly results in the death of arthropods during ecdysis. Although not an adulticide, a high proportion of eggs laid by an adult after exposure to flufenoxuron are non-viable. Combining <b>alphacypermethrin</b> and flufenoxuron ensures both persistence and effective insecticidal activity at all stages of the pest life-cycle.

40|$|Traditional systems {{account for}} 95 % of the {{livestock}} produced in Burkina Faso. Tick infestation hampers livestock productivity in this area. However, little information exists on tick-control practices used by livestock farmers. We interviewed 60 stockbreeders working in traditional farming systems {{to obtain the}} first data on tick-control practices. Sixteen farmers (27 %) did not use conventional practices: seven removed ticks by hand or plastered cattle with dung or engine oil; nine farmers treated cattle with crop pesticides. Forty-four farmers (73 %) used mainly synthetic pyrethroids (SP; either <b>alphacypermethrin</b> or deltamethrin in 20 and 18 farms, respectively) and occasionally amitraz (N = 6). Intervals between treatments varied significantly depending on the chemical used: most farmers using crop pesticides (100 %), amitraz (100 %) or <b>alphacypermethrin</b> (80 %) adjusted tick-control to tick-burden, whereas farmers using deltamethrin tended more to follow a tick-control schedule. Perception of tick-control effectiveness significantly varied among practices: tick-control failures were more frequently reported by farmers using <b>alphacypermethrin</b> (55 %) than by those using either other conventional acaricides (17 %) or crop pesticides (0 %). We investigated whether this could indicate actual development of SP-resistance in cattle ticks. First, using the larval packet test technique, we confirmed that the computation of LC 50 and LC 90 was repeatable and remained stable across generations of the Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) geigyi Hounde´ laboratory strain.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} contact irritant and spatial repellent behaviors in Aedes aegypti following exposure to sublethal concentrations of chemicals. These sublethal actions are currently being evaluated {{in the development of}} a push-pull strategy for Ae. aegypti control. This study reports on mosquito escape responses after exposure to candidate chemicals for a contact irritant focused push-pull strategy using varying concentrations and focal application. METHODS: Contact irritancy (escape) behavior, knockdown and 24 hour mortality rates were quantified in populations of female Ae. aegypti under laboratory conditions and validated in the field (Thailand and Peru) using experimental huts. Evaluations were conducted using varying concentrations and treatment surface area coverage (SAC) of three pyrethroid insecticides: <b>alphacypermethrin,</b> lambacyhalothrin and deltamethrin. RESULTS: Under laboratory conditions, exposure of Ae. aegypti to <b>alphacypermethrin</b> using the standard field application rate (FAR) resulted in escape responses at 25 % and 50 % SAC that were comparable with escape responses at 100 % SAC. Significant escape responses were also observed at < 100 % SAC using ½FAR of all test compounds. In most trials, KD and 24 hour mortality rates were higher in mosquitoes that did not escape than in those that escaped. In Thailand, field validation studies indicated an early time of exit (by four hours) and 40 % increase in escape using ½FAR of <b>alphacypermethrin</b> at 75 % SAC compared to a matched chemical-free control. In Peru, however, the maximum increase in Ae. aegypti escape from alphacypermethrin-treated huts was 11 %. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Results presented here suggest a potential role for sublethal and focal application of contact irritant chemicals in an Ae. aegypti push-pull strategy to reduce human-vector contact inside treated homes. However, the impact of an increase in escape response on dengue virus transmission is currently unknown and will depend on rate of biting on human hosts prior to house exiting...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of how {{mosquitoes}} {{respond to}} insecticides is {{of paramount importance}} in understanding how an insecticide functions to prevent disease transmission. A suite of laboratory assays was used to quantitatively characterize mosquito responses to toxic, contact irritant, and non-contact spatial repellent actions of standard insecticides. Highly replicated tests of these compounds over a range of concentrations proved that all were toxic, some were contact irritants, and even fewer were non-contact repellents. Of many chemicals tested, three were selected for testing in experimental huts to confirm that chemical actions documented in laboratory tests are also expressed in the field. The laboratory tests showed the primary action of DDT is repellent, <b>alphacypermethrin</b> is irritant, and dieldrin is only toxic. These tests were followed with hut studies in Thailand against marked-released populations. DDT exhibited a highly protective level of repellency that kept mosquitoes outside of huts. <b>Alphacypermethrin</b> did not keep mosquitoes out, but its strong irritant action caused them to prematurely exit the treated house. Dieldrin was highly toxic but showed no irritant or repellent action.

In this study, mosquitocidal activity of Schinus terebinthifolia essential oil against Anopheles gambiae s. s., An. arabiensis and Culex quinquefasciatus was assessed in laboratory, semi- field and full- field conditions Method Twenty third instar larvae of both Anopheles gambiae s. s. and Cx. quinquefasciatus were exposed to different dosages of plant extract in both laboratory and semi- field environments. Observation of the mortality response was assessed at intervals of 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Adult semi- gravid female mosquitoes were exposed to papers treated with S. terebinthifolia and compared with WHO standard paper treated with <b>alphacypermethrin</b> (0. 05 %). Results Gas chromatography, coupled to mass spectrometry, identified 15 compounds from S. terebinthifolia extracts, the most abundant identified compound was δ- 3 -carene (55. 36 %) and the least was γ-elemene (0. 41 %). The density of the oil {{was found to be}} 0. 8086 g/ml. The effective dosages in the insectary ranged from 202. 15 to 2625. 20 ppm and were further evaluated in the semi- field situation. In the laboratory, the mortality of Cx. quinquefasciatus ranged from 0. 5 to 96. 75 % while for An. gambiae s. s it was from 13. 75 to 97. 91 %. In the semi- field experiments, the mortality rates observed varied for both species with time and concentrations. The LC 50 and LC 95 value in the laboratory was similar for both species while in the semi- field they were different for each. In wild, adult mosquitoes, the KT 50 for S. terebinthifolia was 11. 29 minutes while for <b>alphacypermethrin</b> was 19. 34 minutes.

40|$|Abstract Background Synthetic {{pyrethroids}} are potent insecticides {{most commonly}} used in the vector control programme. These are applied for indoor residual sprays, space sprays and in impregnated bed nets. Resistance reduces the efficacy of insecticides. Thus, the susceptibility status of the target vector(s) is monitored routinely to select the effective ones. A study was undertaken in a malaria endemic coastal city Mangalore, Karnataka, South India, against the known malaria vector Anopheles stephensi. Methods The susceptibility status was assessed at diagnostic doses of DDT (4 %), malathion (5 %), deltamethrin (0. 05 %), cyfluthrin (0. 15 %), <b>alphacypermethrin</b> (0. 10 %), lambdacyhalothrin (0. 05 %) and permethrin (0. 75 %) using the standard WHO tube test method during October/November 2006. Results Anopheles stephensi was resistant to malathion by 54. 9 %, but tolerant to deltamethrin by 86. 1 %, cyfluthrin 95. 5 % and <b>alphacypermethrin</b> 90. 6 %, whereas it was susceptible to DDT by 98. 1 %, lambdacyhalothrin 98. 6 % and permethrin 100. 0 %, respectively. The KDT 50 and KDT 95 values for these insecticides also showed the similar responses. Conclusion Susceptibility of An. stephensi to DDT is an important finding as this has never been used in Mangalore city, whereas its rural counterpart Anopheles culicifacies is widely resistant to this insecticide. The study explores the selection and rotation of the appropriate insecticide molecule even within the same group for effective vector management. </p...|$|E

The mice were used to simulate the incessant exposure of people working with these pesticides, especially the local retailers and farmers who use them on daily basis with no appropriate storage facility and most often stored in poorly ventilated rooms. Mice were exposed 8 hrs daily to the fumes of these pesticides and fed pelleted mice feeds for 8 weeks. There was a decrease in weight of mice exposed to the insecticides with chlorpyrifos being the most affected. Mice exposed to <b>alphacypermethrin</b> and the control showed no physiological changes while those exposed to chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos showed skin lesions and inflamed bladder respectively. Histology of tissues of the brain, liver, lung and kidney showed edema, inflammations, congestions, nephritis and necrosis. Haematological parameters showed significant decrease in Red Blood Cell (RBC), Haemoglobin (HGB) and Packed Cell Volume (PCV) (P 0. 05). Biochemical parameters showed insignificant increase in Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), creatinine and urea levels (P> 0. 05) except the Alanine phosphatase (ASP) which showed a significant increase (P< 0. 05).

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of insecticide-treated materials (ITMs) for malaria control {{is reduced by}} washing them. This research in Colombia and Bolivia investigated the resistance of different insecticide formulations and, in particular, a commercially available impregnated bednet (PermaNet((R))) which provides chemical protection for the insecticide. The fabrics studied were all polyester; the pyrethroids used for impregnation were deltamethrin (tablet and suspension concentrate both at 25 mg/m(2) target dose), lambdacyhalothrin (capsule suspension at 15 mg/m(2); laboratory study only), <b>alphacypermethrin</b> (suspension concentrate at 40 mg/m(2)) and, {{in the case of}} PermaNet, deltamethrin (55 mg/m(2)). The indicator of wash resistance was Anopheles spp. mortality (using the bioassay cone method) before and after different numbers and intensities of washing. When the fabrics were washed under controlled conditions, gently with water and a bar of soap, the wash resistance of all formulations was good (100 % Anopheles mortality after 3 washes). However, when the impregnated nets were soaked for 30 - 60 min and washed with soap powder and tap water by local women in the usual way, the mortality after 4 washes declined considerably (43 (.) 5 % and 41 (.) 3 % for deltamethrin tablets and liquid respectively when washing every second day). <b>Alphacypermethrin</b> showed slightly better results after 3 washes every 7 th day compared to deltamethrin tablets (63 (.) 8 % and 43 (.) 3 % mortality, respectively). The wash resistance offered by PermaNet was much better and longer lasting: Anopheles mortality after 4 washes was 92 (.) 6 %, after 10 washes 83 (.) 7 % and after 20 washes 87 (.) 1 %.

An ITN mixture of CFP 100 mg/m 2 +alpha 25 mg/m 2 was compared with CFP 100 mg/m 2 and alpha 25 mg/m 2 in a small-scale experimental hut trial {{in an area of}} wild An. arabiensis. The same treatments were evaluated in tunnel tests against insectary-reared pyrethroid susceptible and resistant Culex quinquefasciatus. Performance was measured in terms of insecticide-induced mortality, and blood-feeding inhibition. Tunnel tests showed that mixtures of CFP 100 + alpha 25 were 1. 2 and 1. 5 times more effective at killing susceptible Cx. quinquefasciatus than either Alpha 25 (P = 0. 001) or CFP 100 (P = 0. 001) ITNs. Mixtures of CFP 100 + alpha 25 were 2. 2 and 1. 2 times more effective against resistant Cx. quinquefasciatus than either alpha 25 (P = 0. 001) or CFP 100 (P = 0. 003) ITNs. CFP 100 + alpha 25 produced higher levels of blood-feeding inhibition than CFP alone for susceptible (94 vs 46 %, P = 0. 001) and resistant (84 vs 53 %, P = 0. 001) strains. In experimental huts the mixture of CFP 100 + Alpha 25 killed 58 % of An. arabiensis, compared with 50 % for alpha and 49 % for CFP, though the differences were not significant.

40|$|Abstract Background Anopheles gambiae, {{the main}} malaria vector in Benin has {{developed}} {{high level of}} resistance to pyrethroid insecticides, which is a serious concern to the future use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). In this context, one of the pathways available for malaria vector control would be to investigate alternative classes of insecticides with different mode of action than that of pyrethroids. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate under field conditions the efficacy of a carbamate (bendiocarb) and an organophosphate (fenitrothion) against pyrethroid-resistant An. gambiae s. s. Methods Wild populations and females from laboratory colonies of five days old An. gambiae were bio-assayed during this study. Two pyrethroids (deltamethrin and <b>alphacypermethrin),</b> an organophosphate (fenitrothion), a carbamate (bendiocarb) and a mixture of an organophosphate (chlorpyriphos + a pyrethroid deltamethrin) were compared in experimental huts as IRS treatments. Insecticides were applied in the huts using a hand-operated compression sprayer. The deterrency, exophily, blood feeding rate and mortality induced by these insecticides against An. gambiae were compared to the untreated control huts. Results Deltamethrin, <b>alphacypermethrin</b> and bendiocarb treatment significantly reduced mosquito entry into the huts (p An. gambiae (in the first month) and 77. 8 % (in the fourth month). Bendiocarb and the mixture chlorpyriphos/deltamethrin mortality rates ranged from 97. 9 to 100 % the first month and 77. 7 - 88 % the third month respectively. Conclusion After four months, fenitrothion, bendiocarb and the mixture chlorpyriphos/deltamethrin performed effectively against pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles. These results showed that bendiocarb could be recommended as an effective insecticide for use in IRS operations in Benin, particularly as the mixture chlorpyriphos/deltamethrin does not have WHOPES authorization and complaints were mentioned by the sleepers about the safety and smell of fenitrothion. </p...|$|E

This study reports the susceptibility of the main plague vector Xenopsylla cheopis to 12 different insecticides belonging to 4 insecticide families (carbamates, organophosphates, pyrethroids and organochlorines). Eight populations from different geographical regions of Madagascar previously resistant to deltamethrin were tested with a World Health Organization standard bioassay. Insecticide susceptibility varied amongst populations, but all of them were resistant to six insecticides belonging to pyrethroid and carbamate insecticides (<b>alphacypermethrin,</b> lambdacyhalothrin, etofenprox, deltamethrin, bendiocarb and propoxur). Only one insecticide (dieldrin) was an efficient pulicide for all flea populations. Cross resistances were suspected. This study proposes at least three alternative insecticides (malathion, fenitrothion and cyfluthrin) to replace deltamethrin during plague epidemic responses, but the most efficient insecticide may be different for each population studied.

40|$|Background: Anopheles arabiensis, {{the main}} malaria vector in Ethiopia, shows both {{anthropophilic}} and zoophilic behaviours. Insecticide resistance is increasing, and alternative methods of vector control are needed. The objectives {{of this study}} were to determine the blood meal origins and the susceptibility to insecticides of An. arabiensis from Chano village near Arba Minch in South-West Ethiopia. Methods: Blood meal sources of anopheline mosquitoes collected using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps and pyrethrum spray catches (PSC) from human dwellings, and hand-held mouth aspirators from outdoor pit shelters were analysed using a direct enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The susceptibility of An. arabiensis to pyrethroid insecticides (<b>alphacypermethrin,</b> lambdacyhalothrin, deltamethrin, and cyfluthrin) and DDT was assessed using females reared from larval and pupal collections from natural breeding sites. Results: The blood meal origins of 2967 freshly fed Anopheles mosquitoes were determined. An. arabiensis was the predominant species (75 %), and it fed mainly on cattle. The densities of both freshly fed An. arabiensis and those fed on human blood followed similar seasonal patterns. The overall human blood index (HBI) of An. arabiensis, including mixed blood meals, was 44 % and the bovine blood index (BBI) was 69 %. The HBI of An. arabiensis from CDC light trap collections was 75 % and this was higher than those for PSC (38 %) and outdoor pit shelter collections (13 %), while the BBI was 65 % for PSC, 68 % for outdoor pit shelters and 72 % for CDC light traps. More freshly fed and human blood-fed An. arabiensis were sampled from houses close to the shore of Lake Abaya (the major breeding site). A high proportion of An. arabiensis was resistant to the pyrethroid insecticides, with a mortality rate of 56 % for lambdacyhalothrin, 50 % for cyfluthrin and <b>alphacypermethrin,</b> 47 % for deltamethrin, and 10 % for DDT. Conclusion: Anopheles arabiensis is the predominant species of anopheline mosquito in this region, and cattle are the main source of its blood meals. The greater tendency of this species to feed on cattle justifies the application of insecticides on cattle to control it. However, An. arabiensis has already developed resistance to the available pyrethroid insecticides, and alternative insecticides are needed for malaria vector control. </p...|$|E
