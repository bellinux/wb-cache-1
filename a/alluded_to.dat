[...] Irwin appends a note: [...] "Only a divine author, outside of time, would seem capable of <b>alluding</b> <b>to</b> a later text."

The film and content he controlled would refer to the title as Fuck, including theatrical and DVD editions.

Because the film is about how a taboo word can impact culture, it was important to keep Fuck as its title.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, some 1,500 {{soldiers}} from the 100th were activated and sent to Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, {{in order to provide}} support during the Berlin Crisis.

5|$|In the 12th century, French trouvère (troubadour) Chrétien de Troyes, adapted many of {{the myths}} recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses into Old French.

5|$|Pipe Dream is {{the seventh}} musical {{by the team}} of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II; it premiered on Broadway on November 30, 1955.

Set in Monterey, California, the musical {{tells the story of the}} romance between Doc, a marine biologist, and Suzy, who in the novel is a prostitute; her {{profession}} is only <b>alluded</b> <b>to</b> in the stage work.

It is therefore uncertain {{whether or not it was}} written by Shakespeare.|$|E

5|$|The 1873 mahant–Elokeshi {{incident}} {{was not the}} first incident against a mahant of Tarakeswar. Mahant Shrimanta Giri was executed in 1824 for the murder of his mistress's lover. However, according to Sarkar (author of Hindu wife, Hindu nation), while the 1824 scandal hardly created any public outrage and faded quickly from public memory, the 1873 affair was embedded in public memory and created a huge sensation in contemporary Bengal.
