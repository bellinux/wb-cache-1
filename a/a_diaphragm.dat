5|$|A {{number of}} {{measures}} {{have not been}} confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers. There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching. In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or <b>a</b> <b>diaphragm</b> {{as a method of}} contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods. In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.|$|E
5|$|Two {{important}} legal {{decisions in}} the 1930s helped increase the accessibility of contraceptives. In 1930, two condom manufacturers sued {{each other in the}} Youngs Rubber case, and the judge ruled that contraceptive manufacturing was a legitimate business enterprise. He went further, and declared that the federal law prohibiting the mailing of condoms was not legally sound. Sanger precipitated a second legal breakthrough when she ordered <b>a</b> <b>diaphragm</b> from Japan in 1932, hoping to provoke a decisive battle in the courts. The diaphragm was confiscated by the U.S. government, and Sanger's subsequent legal challenge led to the 1936 One Package legal ruling by Judge Augustus Hand. His decision overturned an important provision of the anti-contraception laws that prohibited physicians from obtaining contraceptives.Rose, Melody, Abortion: A Documentary and Reference Guide, ABC-CLIO, 2008, p. 29.Tone, p. 178: Tone calls the ruling a coup d'etat for Sanger. This court victory motivated the American Medical Association in 1937 to finally adopt contraception as a normal medical service and a core component of medical school curricula.. Retrieved 15 October 2011. However, the medical community was slow to accept this new responsibility, and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill-informed sources until the 1960s.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>diaphragm</b> {{compressor}} (also {{known as}} a membrane compressor) is {{a variant of the}} conventional reciprocating compressor. The compression of gas occurs by the movement of a flexible membrane, instead of an intake element. The back and forth movement of the membrane is driven by a rod and a crankshaft mechanism. Only the membrane and the compressor box come in contact with the gas being compressed.|$|E

25|$|The inner {{elements}} of a microphone are {{the primary source of}} differences in directivity. A pressure microphone uses <b>a</b> <b>diaphragm</b> between a fixed internal volume of air and the environment, and responds uniformly to pressure from all directions, so it is said to be omnidirectional. A pressure-gradient microphone uses <b>a</b> <b>diaphragm</b> that is at least partially open on both sides. The pressure difference between the two sides produces its directional characteristics. Other elements such as the external shape of the microphone and external devices such as interference tubes can also alter a microphone's directional response. A pure pressure-gradient microphone is equally sensitive to sounds arriving from front or back, but insensitive to sounds arriving from the side because sound arriving at the front and back at the same time creates no gradient between the two. The characteristic directional pattern of a pure pressure-gradient microphone is like a figure-8. Other polar patterns are derived by creating a capsule that combines these two effects in different ways. The cardioid, for instance, features a partially closed backside, so its response is a combination of pressure and pressure-gradient characteristics.|$|E

30|$|The {{vertical}} distribution of {{forces from the}} simple equivalent lateral force method, which is commonly used for designing the lateral force-resisting system, is based on assumptions for elastic mode shapes of structures with rigid diaphragms (Fleischman and Farrow 2001; SEAOC 1999). Therefore, for structures with flexible diaphragms, the diaphragm design forces calculated according to the code methods may not be appropriate. When a structure with <b>a</b> flexible <b>diaphragm</b> is considered to have <b>a</b> rigid <b>diaphragm,</b> the period will be underestimated. For structures with periods on the descending branch of the spectral acceleration period plot, this may result in some structural base shears being slightly overestimated. However, the actual displacement will be greater than predicted. That is, the structure with <b>a</b> flexible <b>diaphragm</b> will have larger displacements along the diaphragm length compared with the displacements because of <b>a</b> rigid <b>diaphragm</b> assumption. This unaccounted increased displacement, because of <b>a</b> rigid <b>diaphragm</b> assumption, may increase the possibility of damage because of structural pounding with neighboring structures. It will also affect the distribution of forces between vertical lateral force-resisting ‘VLFR’ elements, which may be critical if they, or the elements they are connected to, do not possess sufficient strength or ductility (Sadashiva et al. 2012).|$|R
