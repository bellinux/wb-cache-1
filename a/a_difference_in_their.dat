Project costs range between $5,000 and $150,000, although the average is between $20,000 and $25,000. The protected areas that result from these deals typically involve a 20- to 30-year commitment. Seacology hopes that during that time the local people grow to respect these resources and ideally progress {{to a point where}} they are less dependent on natural resources. According to marine biologist Mark Erdmann, in a worst-case scenario, if the people violate the contract and destroy the habitat, Seacology will have still made <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lives through its low-cost investment, whereas larger conservation organizations might invest large sums of money but through not addressing the immediate needs of the people, if the project fails, both lose that investment and not have helped the community.|$|E
25|$|Even larger time gaps can be bridged by {{comparing}} human populations with a sufficiently {{long history of}} genetic separation, such as Central Europeans and Japanese. One surface-based study compared the brain shape between these two groups and found <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> gender-dependent brain asymmetries. Neuroimaging studies of this kind, combined with functional ones and behavioural data, provide promising and so far largely unexplored avenues to understand {{similarities and differences between}} different groups of people.|$|E
25|$|SNL {{has also}} {{had an effect on}} American {{elections}} â€“ most commonly presidential elections. Voters have reported that political sketches that were shown on the program influenced them in the voting booth. The so-called SNL Effect was observed during the 2008 presidential campaign, according to Mike Dabadie. Two-thirds of voters who responded to a poll said they had seen a broadcast of politically charged content on SNL, with ten percent saying that it had made <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> decision. Barack Obama was the beneficiary of the political content, with 59 percent saying they did in fact cast a vote for the Democratic then-nominee.|$|E

25|$|Huxley was {{certainly}} not slavish in his dealings with Darwin. As shown in every biography, they had quite different and rather complementary characters. Important also, Darwin was a field naturalist, but Huxley was an anatomist, so there was <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> experience of nature. Lastly, Darwin's views on science were different from Huxley's views. For Darwin, natural selection {{was the best way}} to explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations: it solved problems. Huxley, on the other hand, was an empiricist who trusted what he could see, and some things are not easily seen. With this in mind, one can appreciate the debate between them, Darwin writing his letters, Huxley never going quite so far as to say he thought Darwin was right.|$|E

The predicables are a fivefold division of General Names, not grounded as usual on <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> meaning, that is, in the attribute which they connote, but on a difference in the kind of class which they denote.

Referring once more to phenomena of vision, every one knows that a patch of black on a white ground looks blacker, and a patch of white on a black ground looks whiter, than elsewhere. As the blackness and the whiteness must really be the same, the only assignable cause for this is <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> actions upon us, dependent upon the different states of our faculties. It is simply a visual antithesis.|$|E

There was <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> laughter, the result of the dissimilar lives they had led. One had ever been a happy, careless child, allowed to roam about in the castle or beyond it almost unattended, and had only to hold herself as became the position of a maiden of rank on special occasions, as when guests were staying in the castle; the other had been for years her father's assistant, engaged in work requiring shrewdness and quickness and not unattended at times with danger. She had been brought into contact with persons of all ranks and conditions, and at times almost forgot her own identity, and was in thought as well as manner the quick-witted messenger of her father.
