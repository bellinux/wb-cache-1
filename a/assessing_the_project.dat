40|$|This chart, {{illustrating}} the 5 processes of PMBOK, helps {{us understand the}} proper way of managing an infrastructure project, from {{the initial stages of}} a project, though its conclusion. The most important starting points of any project are the development of a project charter (including roles and responsibilities) and a preliminary scope statement. The project charter defines the scope, objectives, and overall approach for the work to be completed (Mantel, Meredith, Shafer, Sutton, 2005). It is a critical element for initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> It should be the single point of reference on the project for project goals and objectives, scope, organization, estimates, work plan, and budget. In addition, it serves as a contract between the Project Team and the Project Sponsors, stating what will be delivered according to the budget, time constraints, risks, resources, and standards agreed upon for the project. A project that does not have a formal project charter can lead to much confusion, as people really do not understand the fundamental objectives to the project, nor the principles on how it would be managed. The document itself should also consist of appropriately defined scope and responsibilities...|$|E

30|$|Despite the {{considerable}} amount of research conducted on project success, no consensus has yet been reached regarding the definition of project success and project failure (Ika 2009). Project success is a multi-dimensional construct of compliance with overall project objectives (Jugdev and Müller 2005), with different dimensions having been suggested as essentials (Ika 2009). The classic solution upon which most researchers can agree is to apply the “triangle of virtue” as success criteria: time, costs and quality (Ika 2009; Raz et al. 2002). We define project success as the compliance of the project’s outcome with what is specified in the project plan regarding time, costs, and quality. In the present study, the anticipated project success is measured by <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> managers’ expectations of future project success. We consider anticipated project success to be a relevant measure in our model, as decision makers and project managers are likely to base their decision to begin or to continue a project on how successful they anticipate the project to be. After introducing the research background of risk assessment in project management {{and the concept of}} project success, we now move to the concept of overconfidence seeking to explain why project managers’ risk assessment may be overly positive.|$|E

40|$|The {{choice of}} the {{construction}} system is a multivariate decision making with criteria that vary from one project to the other, depending on the particularities and constraints imposed on the builder. This research develops a tool that measures the constructability of various construction projects. The decision making logic is based on fuzzy set theory (FST). FST is used to address uncertainties in decision making. The tool is generic enough to allow the user to encompass the criteria of the project at hand and to select the construction system best suited for its execution. The objective {{of this research is}} the development of the decision support model and the demonstration of its use. This research also furnishes an extensive environment for further development. It provides the blueprint to achieve the overall goal of <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> constructability and smoothes the path for further refinement of the rules to be used at each step of the overall model.

30|$|By {{reviewing}} the above table, the alert reader has already {{noticed that a}} vast majority of the published studies in the literature have primarily focused on monitoring the schedule or cost performance using Shewhart-type control charts in which the individual performance indicators are plotted against three-sigma limits. One criticism on the use of such control charts, however, is that they ignore project-specific dynamics and can lead to weak results and misleading interpretations. Colin and Vanhoucke (2014) argue that the statistical process control should be applied in a different way to the project management context (Colin and Vanhoucke 2014). They present a novel control chart in which control limits are constructed based on the subjective estimates of the activity duration and its dependencies with the activity’s costs. However, in their control chart, it is assumed that cost has a high correlation with the time performance of the activities, which might not necessarily coincide with the real-life situations. More precisely, when the focus is on controlling the time performance of a project, cost-based data should not be considered as the only proxy for <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> schedule performance. As a result, the generalizability of much published researches on this issue is problematic. Therefore, in practice, many if not most project managers are interested in having a project-specific control chart for monitoring the schedule performance of their projects.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{spite of}} all that is known about project {{management}} best practices, they are often absent from typical construction projects. This has motivated our interest in developing a tool to assess construction project management practices, focusing on the assessment of individual project practices. We will also explore project outcomes and their correlation with project management practices-potentially identifying project management value. Previous efforts have addressed project management assessment. The paper describes examples that assess an individual's project management skills and approaches that examine the project management competencies of organizations. In contrast to these, our focus is on <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> management practices that have been implemented for specific construction projects. A central component of any assessment scheme is the identification of specific elements to be assessed (the assessment “targets”). We intend to draw heavily upon established project management standards and project success factors from previous research to provide the specific targets and benchmarks to be assessed. These include the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) by the PM Institute, the IPMA Competence Baseline (ICB) by the International PM Association, ISO 9000, and Prince 2 by The Office of Government Commerce UK. This paper describes how these standards are integrated into the project management assessment tool. It discusses the theoretical foundations for the project management assessment tool and the methodologies used for developing the tool and for applying the tool to specific project situations...|$|E

40|$|Social {{learning}} {{was incorporated into}} the Visual Communication Design curriculum in a project called Citizenship. The purpose {{of the project was}} to address social issues that stem from the colonial and apartheid past in South Africa. Experience cannot be separated from our learning; what happened in the past still has an effect on many facets of the social psyche, like self-esteem, for instance. Our collective history therefore affects individual learning. Emotions and learning are closely related. In the project mental and bodily learning were addressed by means of theoretical discussions, community interactions and the utilisation of design projects as a medium to work through sensitive issues. Race-related issues, such as stereotyping, power relations and blackness/whiteness, were discussed, because those still are important issues in everyday social interactions. After the community interaction students wrote self-reflections about their experiences in the community and the about discussions they had had with community members. The action-orientated case study methodology was used to investigate the Citizenship project with the aim of <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> and bringing about further improvements in the curriculum. Data were collected through the students' written reflections, in-depth interviews and class and community observations, as well as reflections by the lecturer/researcher on her role. The action-orientated case study approach encourages the realisation of the researcher's subjectivist point of view in opposition to a more objectivist stance. The data were evaluated with the understanding that it was potentially biased, prejudiced and ambiguous. © Common Ground, Sophia Rosochacki, Elmarie Costandius, All Rights Reserved...|$|E
40|$|R&D project outcome {{assessment}} is conducted annually in government funding {{agencies such as}} the committee of the national natural science foundation of China (NSFC). The R&D project outcomes are assessed with grades for references for the project investigators' future applications in NSFC. This paper focuses on investigating a scientific approach to assessing R&D project outcomes in NSFC. In the approach, methods are developed for <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> outcomes on the Web, against multiple criteria, such as journal article, conference paper, writing, award, patent, influence on society and influence on academic status of the undertaking university. Because the decision makers (DMs) may be located all over the world, they may have different culture and education backgrounds. Thus multiple representation forms are used to express their preference information on the weights of criteria on Web. An optimization model is used to obtain the weights of criteria based on the DMs' social preference information. The technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is used to rank the projects. A Web-based group decision support system is planned to conduct the assessment process.

40|$|All {{engineering}} students completing {{the final year}} of manufacturing and mechanical engineering at Swinburne University of Technology (SUT) must undertake a comprehensive final year project. The project may encompass many areas of design, analysis, research, development or management. Often the projects integrate a number of these aspects. It is often the assessment of the project, not the pursuit of it by the student that presents difficulties for the academic faculty. In the past, techniques of <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> have proved difficult, particularly where the faculty supervisor has control over the execution of the project and has some positive or negative bias towards either the student or their project. This bias is often introduced in the final assessment, making it difficult to compare and quantify the final results of a cohort of projects resulting from many different supervisors. In an attempt to make the assessment process bias-neutral a comprehensive set of criteria have been introduced; in all seven steps are involved in the assessment procedure, only one of which is dependent on the supervisors, thus reducing their influence on the final grade. The assessment is classified according {{to the quality of the}} work (two assessments), a formal verbal presentation (two additional assessments), a large poster display (two further independent assessments) and a project performance assessment by the students’ supervisor (the only direct influence by the supervisor). The results of this assessment procedure have produced a “bell curve” series of grades or results, whereas in previous years a skew towards one end of a bell curve was usually obtained. This has been shown to be bias-free with regards to high or low grades and was a reflection of students; grades in other subjects. Overall, there seems to be satisfaction by both faculty members and the student cohort in the final grades achieved...|$|E
