The research hypothesis is that EU <b>anti-corruption</b> <b>policies</b> are used not so much to control corruption as to control and diminish the powers of nation states and to redesign the classic power balance in these democratic states. The actors who end up being empowered are supranational, international and non-governmental entities: the EU/ the European Commission, International Organizations and domestic civil society with a pro-EU agenda. The domestic decision-makers are structurally disempowered by the <b>anti-corruption</b> <b>policies.</b> The lessons derived from the specific experience of Romania and Bulgaria have a general value because their model inspired the recent decision of the European Commission to introduce the same <b>anti-corruption</b> <b>policies</b> across the EU. ...|$|R

40|$|In many {{developing}} and transition countries, we observe rather {{high levels of}} corruption. We argue that the missing political support for <b>anti-corruption</b> <b>policies</b> {{is due to a}} lack of economic and financial reforms. Our model is based on the fact that corrupt officials have to pay entry fees to get lucrative positions. In a probabilistic voting model, we show that this, together with the lack of economic opportunities, makes <b>anti-corruption</b> <b>policies</b> less likely. Compared to a reformed economy, more voters are part of the corrupt system and, more importantly, rents from corruption are distributed differently. Economic liberalization increases the support for anti-corruption measures. The additional effect of financial liberalization is ambiguous. Copyright (c) 2009 The Authors.

50|$|Transparency International and the Institute of Public Affairs {{publishes the}} National Integrity System Assessment (NIS) for each country listing whereby it evaluates the {{capabilities}} of the country’s key institutions to hinder the prevalence of corruption. According to the 2012 assessment, Transparency International notes that Poland has achieved a fairly satisfactory outcome and that corruption is not as problematic as it was during the mid 1990s after the collapse of Communism. Additionally, Poland’s joining of the European Union in 2004 has placed expectations on Poland to improve the integrity of their political and corporate affairs. During 2002-2005, Poland is noted for implementing legal changes that extends punishment of corruption in Poland’s Criminal Code. However, the assessment highlights that corruption in Poland is still a concern and must be addressed. The assessment asserts that a key component of Poland’s relatively slow and small improvements in dealing with corruption is the lack of commitment from Poland’s decision makers as there have been several unsuccessful attempts to launch a comprehensive <b>anti-corruption</b> <b>policy.</b> NIS suggests that nepotism and cronyism is still prevalent in the political and corporate sphere, which provides a tolerant setting for corruption. The assessment also takes into consideration Poland’s Corruption Perception Index, highlighting that the public’s distrust of public entities and the difficulty to establish effective anti-corruption policies has discouraged Poland’s decision makers to improve public relations.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{problematic}} around the fight against corruption in Europe. Specifically it focuses on two organizations: OLAF and GRECO. The aim of this thesis is to determine how intensively these two organizations have contributed {{in the fight against}} corruption in Europe. Historical description, analysis of institutional settings and comparative analysis were used as methods for the solution. The sub-questions, which focused on the organizational structure, the opportunity to influence the investigation, the possibility of setting up <b>anti-corruption</b> <b>policies</b> in Europe and the opportunity to influence the legislation in its Member States, helped to answer the main question. Carrying out this comparison, it was found that although OLAF can conduct its own investigation of financial fraud, it has not got the ability to set up <b>anti-corruption</b> <b>policies</b> in Europe, neither has it got the possibility to influence the legislation in its Member States. In contrast, GRECO does not investigate financial fraud, but it may, to some degree, have influence on setting up the <b>anti-corruption</b> <b>policies</b> in Europe. GRECO also has the power to influence the legislation of its Member States. The conclusion of this work delivers a report on the status and capability to fight against corruption in Europe (from an EU and European Council perspective).
