40|$|One of {{the central}} points of strain within the Conservative-Liberal {{coalition}} government is likely to come around human rights protection in the UK. In opposition the Conservatives promised to radically reform existing legislation, a pledge subsequently watered down to a review of human rights law in the coalition agreement. Bart Cammaerts argues that the threat to human rights provisions nonetheless remains severe, given a broader context of populist sentiment directed against ‘others’, increasingly evident in European and <b>American</b> <b>democracies...</b>|$|R

"Pink tide" [...] (marea rosa, onda rosa) and [...] "turn to the Left" [...] (Sp.: vuelta hacia la izquierda, Pt.: Guinada à Esquerda) are phrases used in {{contemporary}} 21st century political {{analysis in the}} media and elsewhere to describe the perception of a turn towards left wing governments in Latin <b>American</b> <b>democracies</b> straying away from the then more frequent neo-liberal economic model. The shift represented a move toward more progressive economic policies and coincides with a parallel trend towards direct democracy in some communities.|$|R

25|$|<b>American</b> <b>democracy</b> {{promotion}} in the MENA {{region has}} been a highly analyzed and criticized component of both U.S. foreign policy and development strategies.

25|$|Worldwide, the Great Depression had {{the most}} {{profound}} impact in the German Reich and the United States. In both countries the pressure to reform {{and the perception of}} the economic crisis were strikingly similar. When Hitler came to power he was faced with exactly the same task that faced Roosevelt, overcoming mass unemployment and the global Depression. The political responses to the crises were essentially different: while <b>American</b> <b>democracy</b> remained strong, Germany replaced democracy with fascism, a Nazi dictatorship.|$|E

5000|$|In fact, many Latin American {{countries}} {{view the}} 1982 conflict as a clear {{example of how}} the so called Hemispheric relations works.A deep weakening of hemispheric relations occurred due to the US support given, without mediation, to the United Kingdom during the Malvinas/Falklands war in 1982. Some argue this definitively turned the TIAR into a dead letter. In 2001, the United States invoked the Rio Treaty after the 11 September attacks, but Latin <b>American</b> <b>democracies</b> did not join the War on Terror.

25|$|The {{possibility}} of an Islamist rise to power via democratic means (and potential opposition to Israel and/or overthrow of democracy in favor of Islamic government) is an enduring concern for <b>American</b> <b>democracy</b> promotion. It {{may also be a}} matter of U.S. credibility in the MENA region, where America was sharply criticized for seemingly applying a double-standard in the 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections – encouraging free and fair elections, only to withdraw aid and diplomatically boycott the new government when Hamas emerged the victor.|$|E
25|$|The Linwoods; or Sixty Years Since in America (1835) is an {{historical}} romance set during the American Revolution.

25|$|After the {{terrorist}} attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. government officials questioned the lack of large-scale <b>American</b> <b>democracy</b> promotion mechanisms in the MENA region, viewing democracy as a means of promoting moderation and stability and preventing terrorism. This resulted in a ramping-up of diplomatic rhetoric on the necessity of democratization and political reform in the Middle East and an increase in funding for democracy promotion in the region. Spreading democracy was also one rationalization used by neo-conservatives and the Bush administration for undertaking the War in Iraq.|$|E
