Presumably, they think these questions help doctors do their jobs. In contrast, economists are suspicious of such questions. Welfare also occupies {{a central role in}} their profession, with most papers in economics making some reference to individual utility. However, in their applied work, measures of utility (or of the emotions that are related to utility) are not common. One reason is that economists think that utility can be inferred through actions. For example, if the patient buys a banana rather than an apple, when both are available at similar prices and conditions, we make the inference that the patient likes bananas more than apples. Economists say that preferences have been “revealed ” to them. In contrast to standard economics, happiness research takes the position that such an indirect approach to measuring utility is not necessarily always superior to an approach based on direct measures of utility or, more precisely, direct measures of the emotions that are related to utility. Several direct measures of these emotions can be constructed. One that appears promising and which has received some attention from economists is well-being data (sometimes loosely called “happiness data”). Examples include data on happiness (current mood), often captured by the answers to a simple survey question such as “Are you happy? ” and data on contentment (a global judgment on how close we are to achieving “the good life”), often captured by the answers to a survey question such as “Overall, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> with your <b>life?</b> ” Large datasets with well- 31...|$|R
