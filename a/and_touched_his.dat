25|$|The Healing {{the deaf}} mute of Decapolis miracle only {{appears in the}} Gospel of Mark. The Gospel states that Jesus went to the Decapolis and met a man there who was deaf and mute, and cured him. Specifically, Jesus first touched the man's ears, <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> tongue after spitting, and then said Ephphatha!, an Aramaic word meaning Be opened.|$|E
2500|$|And a {{woman was}} there who had been subject to {{bleeding}} for twelve years. [...] She had suffered a great deal {{under the care of}} many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse. When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> cloak, because she thought, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.” Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the sixth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Moses {{returned}} to Jethro {{and asked him}} to let him return to Egypt, and Jethro bade him to go in peace. God told Moses that he could return, for all the men who sought to kill him were dead. Moses took his wife and sons and the rod of God and returned to Egypt. God told Moses to be sure to perform for Pharaoh all the wonders that God had put in his hand, but God would harden his heart, and he would not let the people go. And Moses was to tell Pharaoh that Israel was God's firstborn son, and Pharaoh was to let God's son go to serve God, and should he refuse, God would kill Pharaoh's firstborn son. At the lodging-place along the way, God sought to kill him. Then Zipporah took a flint and circumcised her son, <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> legs with it, saying that he was a bridegroom of blood to her, so God let him alone. The fifth open portion ( [...] , petuchah) ends here.|$|E

2500|$|Jason Francia, {{the son of}} {{a former}} Neverland maid, was the only alleged prior victim to testify. [...] Francia {{described}} three times he had been playing with Jackson: they were tickling each other, and Jackson ended up tickling Francia's [...] "little private region" [...] outside of his clothes for a few minutes each time, with Francia laughing all the while. Francia testified that the third time, Jackson had reached up the leg of Francia's shorts <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> testicles. Francia claimed he needed five years of therapy because of the ordeal. [...] He received settlement money from Jackson, and testified that he thought he deserved even more. [...] Francia also admitted that he and his mother had sold stories of his alleged inappropriate tickling to the tabloids. When Jason Francia originally talked to the police after the 1993 allegations, he told them he had never been touched inappropriately. [...] He made that claim only after extensive police questioning in which they repeatedly called Jackson a [...] "molester" [...] and told Jason that Macaulay Culkin was being molested right then and Jason could {{put a stop to it}} if he confessed. Francia also testified that Jackson gave him money after each tickling incident, mirroring something Francia said in his original police interview: that Jackson would give him money each time he finished reading a book or got an 'A'.|$|E
