40|$|Recognition memory, that is, {{the ability}} to judge whether an item has been {{previously}} encountered in a particular context, depends on two factors: discriminability <b>and</b> <b>criterion</b> setting. Discriminability draws on memory processes while criterion setting (i. e., {{the application of a}} threshold resulting in a yes/no response) is regarded as a process of cognitive control. Discriminability <b>and</b> <b>criterion</b> setting are assumed to draw on distinct anatomical structures, but definite evidence for this assumption is lacking. We applied voxel-based and region of interest-based lesion-symptom mapping to 83 patients in the acute phase of ischemic stroke to determine the anatomical correlates of discriminability <b>and</b> <b>criterion</b> setting in verbal recognition memory. Recognition memory was measured with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Signal-detection theory was used to calculate measures for discriminability <b>and</b> <b>criterion</b> setting. Lesion-symptom mapping revealed that discriminability draws on left medial temporal and temporo-occipital structures, both thalami and the right hippocampus, while criterion setting draws on the right inferior frontal gyrus. Lesions in the right inferior frontal gyrus were associated with liberal response bias. These findings indicate that discriminability <b>and</b> <b>criterion</b> setting indeed depend on distinct anatomical structures and provide new insights in the anatomical correlates of these cognitive processes that underlie verbal recognition memory.

Companys therefore needs a way to stand out and reach the customers. One way of doing this {{is to use the}} marketing strategy celebrity endorsement, where a celebrity promote and do advertising for a companys product. The reason why companys use celebrities is well known, but how companys work when they choose celebrity and work with celebrities is more unknown. This is what this essay is about, the purpose is to study how companys works when they choose a celebrity to work with and also to identify and describe factors <b>and</b> <b>criterions</b> that affect the companys choice of celebrity. To do this, a qualitative reserach has been done in form of two case studies, where the swedish companys OBH Nordica and AXA has been studied in how they work when they have chosen a celebrity to work with and wich factors <b>and</b> <b>criterions</b> that affected that choice. Further studies have also been made in the theoretical field where different authors who have written about celebrity endorsement have been studied. This is to complement the empirical information from the case studies. After analyzing the empirical and theoretical informationen the results shows that the two case companys works in a similar way when they choose and cooperate with a celebrity. The factors <b>and</b> <b>criterions</b> that affect the companys choice of celebrity is also similar. A further similarity was also found between how the case companys worked and with how the theory recommended companies to work. Factors <b>and</b> <b>criterions</b> described in the theory that affect companys choice of celebrity was also similar to the factors <b>and</b> <b>criterions</b> that affected the case companys. To summarize, the study shows that the two case companys works in a similar way when they cooperate with celebrities, and there are similar factors <b>and</b> <b>criterions</b> that affect the choice of celebrity. Similarities were also found to how the theory in the area of celebrity endorsement described how companys should work when they cooperate with celebrities. Finally the factors <b>and</b> <b>criterions</b> that affected the case companys was also similar to the factors <b>and</b> <b>criterions</b> described in the theory...|$|R

For corporate obligations, Fitch's ratings incorporate a measure of investor loss in the event of default, but its ratings on structured, project, and public finance obligations narrowly measure default risk. The process <b>and</b> <b>criteria</b> for rating a convertible bond are similar, although different enough that bonds and convertible bonds issued by the same entity may still receive different ratings.
