The defenders were alerted by the explosions, and opened fire, inflicting heavy casualties; only four attackers survived to reach Casemate Four, which they disabled by firing into apertures and throwing grenades into <b>air</b> <b>vents.</b> The other casemates were cleared with fragmentation and white phosphorus grenades, as the crews had neglected to lock the doors leading into the battery. During the bombing raid, the battery's guns had been moved inside the casemates and the steel doors left open for ventilation. During the battle, 22 Germans were killed and a similar number made prisoners of war. The rest of the garrison escaped undetected by hiding in the underground bunkers.|$|E

5|$|Alien: Isolation was {{released}} on 7 October 2014, featuring two pre-order downloadable content missions that allow players to play two scenes from the original film. The first mission, entitled Crew Expendable, features the original crew of the Nostromo and involves the player controlling Ripley, Dallas or Parker attempting to flush the alien creature from the <b>air</b> <b>vents</b> and into the ship's airlock. The second mission, Last Survivor, is set during the film's finale and involves the player controlling Ripley {{as she tries to}} activate the Nostromos self-destruct sequence and reach the escape shuttle. Unlike the first mission, the second mission is only available for players who pre-ordered the game at certain retailers. Upon release, five additional downloadable content packs for the game were periodically released between October 2014 and March 2015. These packs expand the game's Survivor Mode with new characters, challenges, maps, and other features. A collection featuring the game and all the downloadable content packs {{was released}} for Linux, OS X, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in late 2015.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob and Squidward {{that it is}} {{a perfect}} {{opportunity}} for his business rival, Plankton to steal the Krabby Patty formula. Mr. Krabs has hired Patrick as a security guard so he does not have to pay for a real one, and SpongeBob spectacularly decorates the Krusty Krab. Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs follow SpongeBob into the freezer where he shows them a giant Krabby Patty ice sculpture that he made himself. However, in attempt to take the ice sculpture outside, they accidentally knock SpongeBob out the open freezer door; he then rebounds off the kitchen door and back into the freezer. The impact shuts the door and it locks, trapping all four friends inside. Mr. Krabs remembers that {{there is a way to}} escape without using the door, which is through the ventilation system. While finding their way through the maze of <b>air</b> <b>vents,</b> they look back at some memorable moments in their lives.|$|E
5|$|On {{the south}} side of Kenongo Island is a row of small {{buildings}} called the Tajug. These buildings were originally used as <b>air</b> <b>vents</b> for the tunnel located below the lake. This underground tunnel, constructed in 1761,was an alternative way to reach the Kenongo Island other than by a vessel. Also on {{the south side}} of the Kenongo Island is another artificial island called Cemethi Island (Javanese Pulo Cemethi) or Panembung Island (Javanese Pulo Panembung). It is a one-storeyed structure for the Sultan to meditate, or some said, a hiding place for the royal family during an attack. Another name for this island is Sumur Gumantung, because on {{the south side of}} this island is a well that hangs above the ground. This place could only be reached via the underwater tunnel. The building of Cemethi Island is now also in ruin. A legend says that there is a secret tunnel that connects the palace with the south sea (Indian Ocean) where Nyai Roro Kidul or the Queen of the South has her palace. The supernatural Queen becomes the spiritual wife of Yogyakarta Sultan for many generations.|$|E

40|$|<b>Air</b> release through <b>venting</b> devices during filling {{operations}} {{of an empty}} pipeline can give rise to vast transients which can result in serious damages to the pipes. However, despite {{a large number of}} studies, there is still a significant lack of knowledge regarding the physical processes involved. The present paper aims to address this issue by comprehensive laboratory tests. Two configurations were analysed and both air release valves and orifices were used for <b>air</b> <b>venting.</b> In the first configuration, the <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> was fitted at the downstream end of the pipeline, and the transient showed significant pressure surges consequent to the high velocity impact of the water column on the orifice (or the valve). In the second configuration, the <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> was fitted at an intermediate high point of the pipe profile. In this case, the transient showed very low velocity of the water column at the impact and, consequently, generally negligible pressure surges. © 2016 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research...|$|R

40|$|Revascularization with a {{vein graft}} is a {{mandatory}} method {{for treatment of}} dissecting or pseudoaneurysms of the internal carotid artery. We report the necessity for an <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> from the vein graft and explain its use in our two cases. In Case 1, we searched for a great saphenous vein around its junction with a femoral vein during the harvest of vein graft. An accessory branch of that great saphenous vein was also found around the junctional region with a femoral vein, and was temporarily ligated. At first, anastomosis was completed on both the distal and proximal sides. After the proximal side of a vein graft was opened and the ligation of the branch was loosened, an <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> could be made through the branch of the vein graft. Multiple air bubbles and a large quantity of white microemboli were discharged through this branch. The postoperative course was uneventful. In Case 2, the <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> was omitted to shorten ischemia. During {{the opening of the}} vein graft, the migrated air was observed to move to the middle cerebral artery. A computed tomography scan demonstrated that brain infarction and dysarthria occurred postoperatively. The <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> of the vein graft is essential in extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery, because the air bubbles or microthrombi are easily trapped around the valve and cause cerebral infarction. An <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> can be easily made if the branch of a vein graft exists in the outflow pathway, because intraluminal air or thrombus can be washed out through the branch at the final stage of surgery...|$|R
40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>vent</b> {{systems are}} {{designed}} to protect hydropower penstocks and reservoir outlets under various operating conditions. During an emergency closure of an upstream gate the hydraulic jump that forms downstream of the gate is not stationary and may advance downstream potentially increasing the total air demand. A lab-scale physical model of a general outlet works piping configuration was constructed at Reclamation’s Hydraulics Laboratory in Denver, CO to observe hydraulic jump behavior during emergency gate closures. Parameters including gate discharge, gate closure rate, <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> size, and downstream pipe pressure were tested at two different pipe slopes. Results indicate that the hydraulic jump travel speed is dependent on <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> size as well as gate closure rate, both of which affect the internal pressure in the pipe near the vent connection. For a shallow-sloped pipe, the jump speed remains steady throughout the entire pipe length if the air supply is sufficient. However, if air flow is significantly reduced due to an undersized <b>air</b> <b>vent,</b> unsteady travel speeds and pressure surges were observed. This {{was not the case}} for a steep-sloped pipe which produced steady jump speeds for all vent sizes. Once completed, these results are expected to be applicable for prediction of hydraulic jump travel speed and its effects on <b>air</b> demand for <b>vent</b> sizing considerations based on hydraulic operating conditions...|$|R
