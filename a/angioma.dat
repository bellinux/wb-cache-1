Any of these causes is linked with an increase in the risk of thrombosis. It's also a symptom of liver cirrhosis, due to lowered metabolic function of the liver, which metabolises estrogen, leading to spider <b>angioma,</b> palmary erythema, gynecomastia and testicular atrophy in some male patients.|$|E

Many pregnant women, or women using hormonal contraception, have spider <b>angiomas,</b> due to high estrogen levels in their blood. Individuals with significant hepatic disease also show many spider <b>angiomas,</b> as their liver cannot metabolize circulating estrogens, specifically estrone, which derives from the androgen androstenedione.

50|$|Sturge-Weber syndrome, {{sometimes}} referred to as encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis, is a rare congenital neurological and skin disorder. It is one of the phakomatoses and is often associated with port-wine stains of the face, glaucoma, seizures, mental retardation, and ipsilateral leptomeningeal <b>angioma</b> (cerebral malformations and tumors). Sturge Weber Syndrome can be classified into three different types. Type 1 includes facial and leptomeningeal angiomas as well as the possibility of glaucoma or choroidal lesions. Normally, only one side of the brain is affected. This type is the most common. Type 2 involvement includes a facial <b>angioma</b> (port wine stain) with a possibility of glaucoma developing. There is not any evidence of brain involvement. Symptoms can show at any time beyond the initial diagnosis of the facial <b>angioma.</b> The symptoms can include glaucoma, cerebral blood flow abnormalities and headaches. More research is needed on this type of Sturge Weber Syndrome. Type 3 has leptomeningeal <b>angioma</b> involvement exclusively. The facial <b>angioma</b> is absent and glaucoma rarely occurs. This type is only diagnosed via brain scan.|$|E
30|$|Littoral cell <b>angiomas</b> {{represent}} rare vascular tumours {{that arise}} from the cells that line the red pulp. They are usually detected incidentally, since most littoral cell <b>angiomas</b> remain asymptomatic. While the majority of littoral cell <b>angiomas</b> is benign, cases of malignant lesions have been reported [37]. More importantly, associations with colorectal carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, lymphoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma as well as meningioma have been reported [38].|$|R
50|$|Spider <b>angiomas</b> are {{asymptomatic}} {{and usually}} resolve spontaneously. This {{is common in}} the case of children, although they may take several years to disappear. If the spider <b>angiomas</b> are associated with pregnancy, they may resolve after childbirth. In women taking oral contraceptives, they may resolve after stopping these contraceptives. The spider <b>angiomas</b> associated with liver disease may resolve when liver function increases or when a liver transplant is performed.|$|R

50|$|Cobb {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} congenital disorder characterized by visible skin lesions with underlying spinal <b>angiomas</b> or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).

The intraspinal lesions may be <b>angiomas</b> or AVMs and occur at levels of the spinal cord corresponding to the affected skin dermatomes.

Extragenital lichen sclerosus (LS) presents as porcelain-white scaly atrophic lesions {{with or without}} genital involvement. We report two cases of segmental multiple cherry <b>angiomas</b> in association with extragenital LS. Two unrelated women, aged 46 and 66 years, presented with extragenital LS affecting their axillae and lower abdomen. During the examination, both patients were noted to have several hundred red skin papules in a segmental distribution, affecting the left thigh and flank of one woman, and the right abdomen and back of the other. Clinically and histologically, the papules were consistent with cherry <b>angiomas.</b> The striking segmental distribution of multiple cherry <b>angiomas</b> {{may be due to}} genetic mosaicism; however, segmental Fabry disease was excluded by sequence analysis of the Î±-galactosidase A gene.
