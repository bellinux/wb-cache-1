2500|$|Although {{variable}} in color from blond to nearly black, grizzly bear fur is typically brown with darker legs and commonly white or blond tipped fur on the flank and back. A pronounced hump appears on their shoulders; the hump {{is a good}} way to distinguish <b>a</b> grizzly <b>bear</b> from <b>a</b> black <b>bear,</b> as black bears do not have this hump. Aside from the distinguishing hump <b>a</b> grizzly <b>bear</b> can be identified by a [...] "dished in" [...] profile of their face with short, rounded ears, whereas <b>a</b> black <b>bear</b> has <b>a</b> straight face profile and longer ears. <b>A</b> grizzly <b>bear</b> can also be identified by its rump, which is lower than its shoulders, while <b>a</b> black <b>bear's</b> rump is higher. <b>A</b> grizzly <b>bear's</b> front claws measure about 2-4 inches in length and <b>a</b> black <b>bear's</b> measure about 1-2 inches in length.|$|R

However, he now feels threatened by Chief, a younger, faster Black and Tan Coonhound. Copper hates Chief, who is taking Copper's place as pack leader. During <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> hunt, Chief protects the Master when the bear turns on him, while Copper is too afraid of the bear to confront him. The Master ignores Copper to heap praise on Chief and Copper's hatred and jealousy grow.|$|E
5|$|Grizzly Rage {{breaks the}} {{standard}} mold for many Syfy natural horror films {{in that the}} bear featured is a normal grizzly bear rather than a mutant or genetically altered animal. However, the bear and actors never appear {{together in the same}} frame, rather a man in <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> suit takes over the role when the actors must interact with the bear. Critics heavily panned the film, feeling its plot, script, characters, and special effects were substandard.|$|E
5|$|In Korean mythology, a tiger and <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> {{prayed to}} Hwanung, {{the son of}} the Lord of Heaven, that they might become human.

The tiger gave up after about twenty days and left the cave. However, the bear persevered and was transformed into a woman. The bear and the tiger are said to represent two tribes that sought the favor of the heavenly prince.|$|E

5|$|Like John Filson, Timothy Flint also interviewed Boone, and his Biographical Memoir of Daniel Boone, the First Settler of Kentucky (1833) {{became one}} of the best-selling biographies of the 19th century. Flint greatly embellished Boone's adventures, doing for Boone what Parson Weems did for George Washington. In Flint's book, Boone fought hand-to-paw with <b>a</b> <b>bear,</b> escaped from Indians by {{swinging}} on vines (as Tarzan would later do), and so on. Although Boone's family thought the book was absurd, Flint greatly influenced the popular conception of Boone, since these tall tales were recycled in countless dime novels and books aimed at young boys.|$|E
5|$|Many hybrid {{zones are}} known where the ranges of two species meet, and hybrids are {{continually}} produced in great numbers. These hybrid zones are useful as biological model systems {{for studying the}} mechanisms of speciation. Recently DNA analysis of <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> shot by a hunter in the North West Territories confirmed the existence of naturally-occurring and fertile grizzly–polar bear hybrids.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the other}} Junior Campers, led by Ernest Borgnine, take the correct route, but {{they end up}} in a much worse position: after finding {{themselves}} trapped in a dark, tangled swamp (while being hunted by mountain men), they are attacked by <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> that Borgnine tries but fails to fight off (due to Homer stealing his Swiss Army Knife), and they finally flee to an abandoned summer camp. At the camp, they start singing songs, but are soon attacked by an unseen figure lurking in the woods, and their fates are left unknown.|$|E
5|$|The series {{takes place}} over the span of six books, which are: The Quest Begins, Great Bear Lake, Smoke Mountain, The Last Wilderness, Fire in the Sky, and Spirits in the Stars. The story follows four young <b>bears.</b> Lusa, <b>a</b> black <b>bear,</b> Kallik, <b>a</b> polar <b>bear,</b> Toklo, <b>a</b> grizzly <b>bear</b> and Ujurak, {{who is able to}} shape-shift into any animal, but remains <b>a</b> brown <b>bear</b> most of the time.|$|R

5000|$|<b>A</b> grizzly-polar <b>bear</b> hybrid (known as <b>a</b> pizzly <b>bear</b> or grolar <b>bear)</b> is <b>a</b> rare ursid hybrid {{resulting}} from a union of <b>a</b> brown <b>bear</b> and <b>a</b> polar <b>bear.</b> It has occurred both in captivity and in the wild. In 2006, the occurrence of this hybrid in nature was confirmed by testing the DNA of <b>a</b> strange-looking <b>bear</b> that {{had been shot in}} the Canadian arctic. Previously, the hybrid had been produced in zoos, and was considered a [...] "cryptid" [...] (a hypothesized animal for which there is no scientific proof of existence in the wild).|$|R

Kane chokeslamed Henry {{towards the end of}} the contest and {{attempted}} to pin Henry. Chavo Guerrero and Kenny Dykstra interfered, however, and attacked Kane. Kane fought back and chokeslammed Dykstra, but Henry locked Kane in <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> hug. The referee stopped the contest after Kane kayfabe passed out.|$|E
5|$|The Thanhouser {{adaption}} notably foregoes {{the famous}} Shakespearean stage directions: Exit, pursued by <b>a</b> <b>bear.</b> and allows Antigonus a peaceful exit. Another {{difference in the}} production is that following the collapse and reported death of Hermione. In the play, the audience is aligns with Leontes' view and gives {{no reason to doubt}} Hermione's death, but the Thanhouser adaptation shows the mechanism and conspiracy formed by showing Hermione's revival and departure. Instead of using the Shakespeare character of Time to frame the passage of time, the role is performed by an inter-title. The final scene is missing from the surviving print.|$|E
5|$|The {{coat of arms}} {{includes}} a depiction of the city wall, and two silver strips representing the River Avon and the hot springs. The sword of St. Paul is a link to Bath Abbey. The supporters, a lion and <b>a</b> <b>bear,</b> stand {{on a bed of}} acorns, a link to Bladud, the subject of the Legend of Bath. The knight's helmet indicates a municipality and the crown is that of King Edgar (referencing his coronation at the Abbey). A mural crown, indicating a city, is alternatively used instead of the helmet and Edgar's crown.|$|E

5|$|The pig-faced women {{exhibited}} at fairs were not genuine. Showmen would drug <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> into a stupor by feeding it {{large amounts of}} strong beer, and then shave it. Once shaved, the drunken bear would be fitted with padded artificial breasts, and dressed in women's clothing and a wig. Shoes would {{be attached to the}} bear's hind paws, and stuffed gloves to the front paws. The bear would then be placed in a chair with a hole in the back, and securely tied to the chair.|$|E
5|$|At the farm, the leprechaun lures J. D. {{into a trap}} by imitating a cat, biting and {{injuring}} his hand.

The leprechaun returns to the farmhouse, where he searches for his gold and shines every shoe. After leaving J. D. at the hospital, the group drives back to the farmhouse.

Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) admits an elderly patient, Irving Waller (Ralph Waite), with skin growths, who later reveals that he wants a penile prosthesis, to which he receives. It is revealed that Thatcher needs a liver transplantation, and Stevens is assigned to a cancerous patient, Randy (Jocko Sims), by Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd).
