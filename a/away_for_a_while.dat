25|$|There {{are many}} stories {{surrounding}} {{the circumstances of}} his attempted murder. A version by the 19th-century Ottoman historian Ahmed Cevdet Pasha gives the following account: one of his slaves, a Georgian girl named Cevri, gathered ashes when she heard the commotion in the palace surrounding the murder of Selim III. When the assassins approached the Harem chambers where Mahmud was staying, she was able to keep them <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> by throwing ashes into their faces, temporarily blinding them. This allowed Mahmud to escape through a window and climb onto the roof of the Harem. He apparently ran to the roof of the Third Court where other pages saw him and helped him come down with pieces of clothes that were quickly tied together as a ladder. By this time {{one of the leaders of}} the rebellion, Alemdar Mustafa Pasha arrived with his armed men and upon seeing the dead body of Selim III proclaimed Mahmud as padishah. The slave girl Cevri Kalfa was awarded for her bravery and loyalty and appointed haznedar usta, the chief treasurer of the imperial Harem, which was the second most important position in the hierarchy. A plain stone staircase at the Altınyol (Golden Way) of the Harem is called Staircase of Cevri (Jevri) Kalfa, since the events apparently happened around there and are associated with her.|$|E

25|$|Alfie {{tries to}} start a {{football}} team for the pub, and Kat takes it over. She flirts {{in order to get}} people to sign up, and continues flirting at a party, with Ray Dixon (Chucky Venn), Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), Derek, Max Branning (Jake Wood) and Michael, sharing a close moment with each of them. While in the kitchen alone, an unseen man enters and he and Kat have a sexual encounter. She feels guilty the next day and attempts to neglect calls and texts from the mystery man, who has bought her a new phone. Kat eventually responds and talks with the man to tell him to leave her alone, but changes her mind and they begin a frequent affair, and he supplies them with a flat to use. Kat endeavours several times to end it, but she continuously succumbs. He falls in love with her, with Kat reciprocating, and when he sends Kat flowers, Alfie becomes suspicious. Kat lies they are from Charlie, but Alfie does not believe her and asks her to be totally honest, to which Kat reveals her three-month affair, telling him he does not know the other man. Alfie is furious and throws her out. After a heart-to-heart with Michael, Kat returns to The Queen Victoria to ask for Alfie's forgiveness and suggests going <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b>|$|E
25|$|Later that year, {{following}} {{the example of}} a friend Joe Wallace (Jason Rush) who had told his parents about being gay and HIV-positive, Mark decides to tell his parents. By now, he is dating Rachel Kominski (Jacquetta May), who advises him not to but Mark is tired of the pretence. On Boxing Day Mark tells Pauline and Arthur that he is HIV-positive. They sit in stunned silence while he scatters helpful leaflets around the house and then goes <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> On his return, he faces Pauline's irrational terror and Arthur's hostility. Arthur's ignorance is apparent initially as he fears that Mark will pass HIV on to him; he even bleaches everything Mark touches to avoid infection. Pauline and Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) are understandably distraught but help Arthur to understand the illness, and are a huge support to Mark. Mark's relationship with Rachel ends, and the animosity at home send Mark back to his girlfriend Gill, who moves to London and becomes seriously ill. Gill's HIV has already progressed into AIDS and her deterioration is rapid. She is diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and goes into a hospice. Mark realises that he is in love with her and asks her to marry him. Mark and Gill marry, and their honeymoon consists of one night in a hotel, before Gill returns to the hospice and dies.|$|E
25|$|Ian is pessimistic when Lucy {{decides to}} set up her own {{property}} business and later becomes concerned about her when he discovers she is sleeping with Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) and is taking cocaine. He confronts her and admits she is the child he is most proud of, but this is overheard by Peter, resulting in Lucy storming out. Ian tries to contact her when she does not return home that night, but is later informed by DC Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton) and DS Cameron Bryant (Glen Wallace) that Lucy has been found dead. He identifies her body and then shares his devastating news with Jane, Denise, Cindy, Bobby and finally Peter. Struggling with their grief, Ian and Jane share a passionate encounter, giving Ian hope that they might reunite. When Jane dashes his hopes, Ian takes his anger out on Bobby and Jane decides {{it would be best}} if she take Bobby <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Cindy also leaves the Square to return to Devon with her aunt, Gina Williams. Increasingly alone, Ian leans on Phil for support and questions how he can move on from his daughter's death. With Peter's help, he stages an opening for the new and improved restaurant, but during opening night Summerhayes reveals that Lucy's body has been released for burial. Ian leaves early with Peter to see her, but is unable due to his grief. He wants to organise the funeral for as soon as possible but discovers that Max and Lucy were together; Ian angrily attacks Max as he carries Lucy's coffin down the aisle of the church and it is clear that Ian is not coping. Worried, Sharon believes that he is relying on pills to numb the pain of his grief and she and Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) comfort him.|$|E

Lead singer Chris Martin stated, [...] "We really feel that we have to be <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> and we certainly won't release anything this year, because I think people are a bit sick of us." [...] This plan was not carried out, because of the pressure their second album A Rush of Blood to the Head had induced; but they were trying [...] "to make the best thing that anyone has ever heard".|$|E

500|$|On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his Triumph {{motorcycle}} {{near his}} home in Woodstock, New York, suffering cracked vertebrae and a mild concussion. The concerts he was scheduled to perform had to be cancelled. Biographer Clinton Heylin wrote in 1990 on the significance of the crash: [...] "A quarter of a century on, Dylan's motorcycle accident is still viewed as the pivot of his career. As a sudden, abrupt moment when his wheel really did explode. The great irony is that 1967—the year after the accident—remains his most prolific year as a songwriter." [...] In a 1969 Rolling Stone interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, [...] "I had a dreadful motorcycle accident which put me <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> and I still didn't sense the importance of that accident till at least a year after that. I realized that it was a real accident. I mean I thought that I was just gonna get up and go back to doing what I was doing before ... but I couldn't do it anymore." ...|$|E

Club {{gave the}} episode an 'A', saying [...] "Community is going <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> but it's going away with an episode {{that reminds me}} why I love the show so much. This is a very {{personal}} thing—since humor's subjective like that—but for me, this was the funniest episode since the clip show... I laughed myself silly at this one, {{to the point where}} I was devolving into hiccups at certain scenes, and I'm glad we get to go out on an episode like this, one that plays around with form and makes me laugh." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix also praised the Glee-spoofing, saying [...] "'Regional Holiday Music' was the logical, clever, funny endpoint to it." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said, [...] "As with its best theme-episodes, the show bridged the gap between high-concept parody and character-based comedy." [...] TV Fanatic's Leigh Raines gave the episode a 4/5 rating, saying while the show [...] "definitely went out with a bang, it didn't totally blow my socks off... While there were a few moments that upped the ick factor, overall this episode fell on the positive side." [...] She praised Troy and Abed's rap performance, but called the scene where Annie seduces Jeff [...] "creepy". Robert Canning of IGN said it was a [...] "great" [...] episode, but [...] "faltered just a bit" [...] at the end: [...] "Abed's realization that his attempts to brighten the holiday only made things darker, as Jeff had previously suggested, fit the character well enough, but the study group's follow-up felt a bit forced and holiday hokey. Of course, that could well have been the point." ...|$|E
