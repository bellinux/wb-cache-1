50|$|During the {{caliphate}} of the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid I, the Berber commander Tariq ibn-Ziyad led a small {{force that}} landed at Gibraltar on 30 April 711, ostensibly {{to intervene in}} a Visigothic civil war. After a decisive victory over King Roderic at the Battle of Guadalete on 19 July 711, Tariq ibn-Ziyad, joined by the Arab governor Musa ibn Nusayr of Ifriqiya, brought most of the Visigothic kingdom under Muslim occupation in a seven-year campaign. The Visigothic resistance to this invasion was ineffective, though sieges were required to sack a couple of cities. The main reason the cities were overwhelmed so easily is not easily explained, since the only surviving sources were Muslims whose accounts were anecdotal. The Visigothic territories included what is today Spain, Portugal, <b>Andorra,</b> <b>Gibraltar,</b> <b>and</b> the southwestern part of France known in ancient times as Septimania. The invading Moors wanted to conquer and convert all of Europe to Islam, so they crossed the Pyrenees to use Visigothic Septimania as a base of operations.|$|R

All previous literature {{records are}} given, and interpreted where needed. Detailed records are given for material collected and /or studied by us. In total 102 Nepticulidae and 5 Opostegidae are listed. Stigmella nivenburgensis (Preissecker, 1942), S. rhamnella (Herrich-Schäffer, 1860), S. crenulatae (Klimesch, 1975) (on new host Rhamnus lycioides), S. sorbi (Stainton, 1861), Trifurcula (Trifurcula) beirnei Puplesis, 1984, Ectoedemia (Fomoria) euphorbiella (Stainton, 1869) (on three new hosts in the genus Euphorbia) and E. (E.) subbimaculella (Haworth, 1828) are new for Spain, and Stigmella rhamnella (Herrich-Schäffer, 1860), S. crenulatae (Klimesch, 1975), S. paradoxa (Frey, 1858), S. crataegella (Klimesch, 1936), S. hybnerella (Hübner, 1813), S. incognitella (Herrich-Schäffer, 1855), Trifurcula (Glaucolepis) rosmarinella (Chrétien, 1914), T.

Stigmella ilicifoliella (Mendes, 1918) and Acalyptris minimella (Rebel, 1924) {{are the first}} Nepticulidae recorded for resp. <b>Andorra</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gibraltar.</b> Stigmella assimilella (Zeller, 1848), S. vimineticola (Frey, 1856) and S. obliquella (Heinemann, 1862) are confirmed as Spanish. Previous records of Stigmella viscerella and S. lemniscella could not be confirmed and are regarded as doubtful. Stigmella ruficapitella (Haworth) and Trifurcula pallidella (Duponchel) are removed from the Portuguese and Spanish lists, and Ectoedemia groschkei (Skala) is shown to have been incorrectly cited from Spain. For many species we provide the first detailed records, since they were previously only listed in checklists. Records are summarized per provinces, the highest recorded number of species is 46 for Teruel in Spain, and 34 for the Algarve in Portugal. We illustrate leafmines and genitalia of several rare species of Nepticulidae. The male and female genitalia of Opostegoides menthinella (Mann, 1855) and Pseudopostega chalcopepla (Walsingham, 1908) are illustrated for the first time; Opostegoides menthinella and Pseudopostega chalcopepla are also recorded from Tunisia for the first time.
