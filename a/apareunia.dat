40|$|A 49 -year-old {{woman with}} history of {{rheumatoid}} arthritis presented with worsening pelvic pain. A pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a fracture and a lytic expansile lesion within the right superior and inferior pubic rami. The diagnosis of “insufficiency fractures secondary to rheumatoid arthritis” was established. Six months later, she started describing pain and fullness sensation in the vagina which {{eventually led to}} a complete <b>apareunia.</b> An x ray confirmed healing of the previous fractures, fracture of both left superior and inferior pubic rami, and an upwards shift of the right hemi-pelvis. Conservative management was chosen. Twelve months later, no improvement occurred {{and she was still}} apareunic. A “corrective osteotomy surgery” was performed and the displaced pubic rami and ischial tuberosities were remodelled bilaterally through a vertical incision over each labia majora. These bones were partially excised until an adequate vaginal opening was established. Her symptoms have impressively resolved with complete reverse of the <b>apareunia...</b>|$|E
30|$|All {{patients}} underwent meticulous preoperative anamnesis and examination {{focusing on}} previous history, type {{and location of}} the pain, functional intestinal disorders including dyschesia, rectal pain, cyclical and noncyclical rectal bleeding, tenesmus, and diarrhea, and at last the classical symptoms of endometriosis such as dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia or <b>apareunia,</b> or infertility. During preoperative clinical examination and colposcopy, particular {{attention was paid to}} presence of a deep infiltrating endometriosis of the posterior fornix or rectovaginal space or of the uterine parametria.|$|E
30|$|During the study, we {{observed}} also that {{in patients with}} a clinical rectovaginal endometriosis founded by the vaginal palpation (n[*]=[*] 702) added {{to the presence of}} cyclical dyschesia, abdominal bloating and tenesmus with a normal bowel function during the menstrual cycle, and apparition of a constipation {{at the beginning of the}} period followed 2 to 3  days later by a diarrhea was correlated in 78.2 % with a deep infiltration of the rectosigmoide required bowel surgery (n[*]=[*] 201). The combination of these mentioned symptoms with an <b>apareunia</b> shows then a positive predictive value for bowel infiltration of 95 %.|$|E
40|$|To the Editors: Couple {{characteristics}} and outcome of therapy in vaginismus In the article titled, ‘Couple {{characteristics and}} outcome of therapy in vaginismus ’ [1], Munasinghe and colleagues {{appear to have}} confused dyspareunia with vaginismus. Vaginismus is a classical psychosomatic disorder which usually results in complete <b>apareunia</b> and non-consummation of marriage. Milder forms of vaginismus can cause dyspareunia at coitarche and it may sometimes persist thereafter. Their reference to Rafla [2] with regard to avoidable causes of secondary vaginismus is incorrect. Rafla reported a case of bilateral vaginal tears occurring when an inexperienced person inserted a Cusco’s bivalve vaginal speculum into a sexually active nulliparous woman with vaginismus...|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to isolate from the {{clinical}} history and examination, symptoms, or combination of symptoms highly suspicious for intestinal infiltration in endometriosis patients. In a prospective study, preoperative anamnesis on defecation problems and pain symptoms was correlated with the vaginal examination and the laparoscopic findings in 2, 000 consecutive patients with suspicion of intestinal endometriosis; 65.7 % of the patients reported a typical symptomatology combining left-sided pelvic pain irradiating systematically to the back and occasionally to the left leg, with dyschesia, abdominal bloating, and/or sensation of a doubt masse in the left lower or middle abdomen, sometimes rectorrhagia and an improvement in the pain after defecation. In the absence of a palpable endometriotic nodule of the rectovaginal space, the combination of this symptoms correlated in 93.7 % of the patients with an outlet constipation syndrome due to a significant elongation with kinking of the rectosigmoide. In the patients with a palpable endometriotic nodule of the posterior fornix (n[*]=[*] 712), the combination of an <b>apareunia</b> with the apparition of constipation for 2 – 3  days at the beginning of the period bleeding followed by a diarrhea until the end of the period shows a positive predictive value for deep intestinal infiltration of 95 %. In all endometriosis patients undergoing a laparoscopy for pain and intestinal disorders, the elongation of the rectosigmoide must be perceived and recognized as a potential cause for an outlet constipation syndrome which can be cured easily by a left-sided sigmoidopexy. In patients with a macroscopic endometriotic nodule of the posterior fornix, the presence of an <b>apareunia</b> and the apparition of constipation at the beginning of the menstruation followed 2 – 3  days later by a diarrhea are strong arguments for an invasive intestinal endometriosis, and those patients must be primarily referred to a tertiary referral center.|$|E
30|$|After {{correlation}} of the preoperatively collected data with the intraoperative findings, we focused {{our attention on}} the positive predictive value of the different symptoms predicting a rectum and/or a sigmoide infiltration requiring bowel surgery: no single symptom offered a positive predictive value exceeding 70 %. However, the positive predictive value for the bowel symptoms differed completely depending on the presence or not of an infiltrative endometriosis of the rectovaginal space. Abdominal bloating and dyschesia show, respectively, a positive predictive value for intestinal infiltration of 84 % and 79 % when a endometriotic nodule was palped in the posterior fornix while {{in the absence of}} a rectovaginal infiltration, these values fell to 3.2 % and 2.8 %, respectively. A <b>apareunia</b> present a positive predictive value for endometriosis of the rectovaginal space and/or for uterine retroversion or retroflexio of 92 %.|$|E
40|$|Abdomino-perineal {{resection}} (APR) is {{a commonly}} performed surgical procedure {{in the treatment}} of colonic and rectal cancer. This operation leaves the patient with a permanent colostomy and a large pelvic floor defect significantly contributing to patient morbidity. Sexual dysfunction, as a complication of APR, is often overlooked, because the focus remains on disease eradication and in most cases, there are limited if any adjunct treatments available. As the incidence of bowel cancer increases in younger populations, this can {{have a significant impact on}} the quality of life and wellbeing of women. It is well known that vaginal wall defects, incontinence and sexual dysfunction are expected complications of radical lower gastrointestinal and urological surgery. Vaginal axis deviation secondary to radical surgery is a rarer or perhaps less reported complication, which if left untreated, may have a significant impact on sexual function. To date, most case reports have dealt with concomitant vaginal reconstruction with myocutaneous flaps, but none have addressed surgical options that specifically target vaginal axis deviation. We present the first case of successful reconstructive surgery to alter vaginal axis in an attempt to reverse <b>apareunia</b> years after APR...|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was not the {{symptoms}} predicitng an endometriosis of the rectovaginal space, as this diagnosis is easy to obtain by rectovaginal examination and colposcopy, but the symptoms that predict intestinal infiltration. This is absolutely essential as this determines the further management of the patient. The study shows that the classical symptoms of endometriosis are poor markers for the diagnosis of intestinal endometriosis, and the classical combination of rectal bleeding with pelvic pain and constipation is definitively not pathognomonic for an intestinal infiltration. Not only the anamnesis but also the clinical diagnosis of an infiltrative endometriosis of the rectovaginal space by the vaginal palpation and the colposcopy is essential for the further management of the patients. The study suggests that in patients with a macroscopic endometriotic nodule of the posterior fornix, the presence of an <b>apareunia</b> and the apparition of constipation {{at the beginning of the}} menstruation followed 2 – 3  days later by a diarrhea speak very strongly for a rectal infiltration with reduction of the intestinal lumen. In turn, in absence of a rectovaginal endometriosis, symptoms such as pain starting in the left lower abdomen with irradiation to the back and the left leg, abdominal bloating, the sensation of an abdominal masse in the middle or lower left abdomen and cyclical rectal bleeding (internal hemorrhoids) are all symptoms speaking strongly for an outlet constipation syndrome by elongation and kinking of the rectosigmoide. The combination of these symptoms with the finding of an elongation of the rectosigmoide and/or passage difficulties by 15  cm from the linea dentata during the colonoscopy makes this diagnosis quite certain. The study suggest that the incidence of such a outlet constipation syndrome is quite high in endometriosis patients (64.45 %) and must be perceived and recognized by gynecologists as a potential and frequent cause for pelveoabdominal pain with abdominal bloating and rectorraghia. This is of importance since this painful functional disorder of the intestine can be treated successfully by a laparoscopic left-sided rectosigmoidopexy—a simple technique with low morbidity—and in situation of failure of this procedure by a sacral nerve stimulation [5] or at last by a bowel resection or anastomosis [6].|$|E
