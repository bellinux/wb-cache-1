5|$|As Styles was {{examining}} the ricochet marks, Alison Cahn {{was approached by}} an elderly woman, who led Cahn to a nearby apartment building. There, the woman introduced Cahn to her daughter—Carmen Proetta—who told Cahn that she had witnessed the shooting at the petrol station; although initially reluctant, she was persuaded by Cahn to give her account of the events in an affidavit. Proetta asserted that, immediately before McCann and Farrell were shot, she saw a police car travelling north on Winston Churchill Avenue with its siren activated; <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>watched,</b> the police car stopped abruptly and four men—one uniformed police officer and three men in civilian clothes—jumped out. She stated that the three men in plain clothes, all carrying pistols, leapt across the central reservation barrier, at which point she saw McCann and Farrell raise their hands. Proetta believed that all three men then opened fire, while McCann and Farrell had their hands in the air, and that neither suspect made any movements towards their clothing or Farrell's handbag. She went on to state that she witnessed {{one of the men}} crouch over McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, and continue to shoot them. According to Styles, Proetta's account of the shooting tallied with the bullet marks he examined at the petrol station; he also found her description of the bullets striking the bodies particularly convincing, believing that only somebody who had witnessed such an event would be able to describe it so vividly. The journalists also discovered that Proetta's account of the soldiers arriving in a police car matched some of the newspaper reports from the day after the shootings.|$|E

It was held on April 16, at 2 p.m., four hours after Martin's, also during heavy rainfall. Texas High School dismissed at noon that day for her funeral. Hundreds of young people attended the separate funerals. Booker's mother could not control her grief <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> {{the long line of}} teenagers file by her casket. Atkins was one of the pallbearers. She was then buried in Woodlawn Cemetery located between 3006 State Line Avenue and 3085 County Avenue. Miss Booker was survived by her mother (died in 1977), stepfather, both grandparents, three aunts and three uncles.|$|E
25|$|In Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn Cathy Davidson {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} attention blindness: humans perceive {{only a fraction of}} everything going on around us, particularly when we're focusing intently on one specific task, and that this attention blindness does not properly prepare us for the multi-task oriented digital age. According to Davidson, attention blindness is a basic neurological feature of the human brain. In the introduction of Now You See It, Davidson describes attending a lecture on attention blindness which addressed the tendency of the human brain to concentrate intensely on one task at the expense of missing almost everything else. To demonstrate this tendency, the lecturer showed a video of six people passing basketballs back and forth, and instructed viewers to count the number of tosses only between those wearing white shirts. Many people correctly counted fifteen tosses, yet nearly everyone failed to see someone in a full gorilla suit stride in among those tossing basketballs, then walk away. Davidson, who is dyslexic, didn’t even try to keep count, but instead decided to relax <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> the tape, and thus, she noticed the gorilla.|$|E

500|$|By January 1927, Marquis {{was working}} this {{material}} {{into a book}} that would eventually become The Cheyennes of Montana. There were to be chapters on Chaudel, Iron Teeth, Wooden Leg, and Tangled Yellow Hair. However, Marquis developed a particularly strong relationship with Wooden Leg, whose lengthy narrative eventually became a separate book, A Warrior Who Fought Custer. Also covered separately was Kate Big Head's narrative, published <b>as</b> <b>She</b> <b>Watched</b> Custer's Last Battle. Another narrative included in The Cheyennes is, [...] "A Cheyenne Old Man".

500|$|According to the {{producers}} of House, Stacy was brought into the show to give viewers some insight into House. The writers chose to start off Stacy's story arc [...] "very subtly", but to end it with a [...] "big blowout". Shore explained that he wanted Ward for the part {{because it was the}} first person the writing staff of House came up with, adding that she acts in a [...] "simple" [...] and [...] "convincing way". Initially, Ward was not interested in portraying the character, because, after the cancellation of Once and Again, she wanted to spend more time with her kids, which is why she had also turned down earlier roles on [...] and Desperate Housewives. However, she changed her mind when she saw tapes of the show, because <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> she realized that House [...] "would be fun to be a part of".|$|E
500|$|Muldaur was not {{required}} to audition {{for the role of}} Pulaski. [...] Instead, she was given 15 VHS cassettes of the first season. She found it [...] "very exciting", noting it [...] "got better and better and better" [...] <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> it. Christina Pickles was also considered for the part of Pulaski, a decision Berman described as [...] "very tough". Muldaur finally agreed to play the role, but asked Roddenberry to change the name of the character to Kate, which became Katherine. [...] The character of Katherine Pulaski was modeled on Doctor Leonard McCoy from The Original Series. [...] Like McCoy, [...] Pulaski feared transporters and disliked unemotional colleagues. [...] The dynamic between McCoy and Spock was revisited with the relationship between Pulaski and Lieutenant Commander Data. Muldaur believed that Roddenberry deliberately created the parallel between the two characters on the two shows.|$|E

500|$|Robert Canning praised Morris for her {{performance}} in [...] "A Very Glee Christmas", and wrote: [...] "The heart of [...] "A Very Glee Christmas" [...] {{was found in}} Artie Abrams attempt to keep Brittany's belief in Santa Claus alive. Heather Morris perfectly played up Brittany's innocence and joy surrounding everything Santa. Her interaction with the black mall Santa was a highlight. Watching Artie, and eventually {{the rest of the}} club, work to keep Brittany's belief intact was truly in the spirit of Christmas and should have been made into a fuller part of the episode. Also shining in this storyline was Dot Jones as Coach Bieste. Her scene as Santa, and then her knowing expression <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> Artie walk, were the best moments of the episode." [...] In January 2010, Morris and her co-stars won the [...] "Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series. Later that year, Brittany and Santana were nominated for the [...] "Favorite Fictional Lesbian Couple" [...] award at the AfterEllen.com Visibility Awards.|$|E
500|$|Joel Keller of AOLTV complimented Jones in [...] "A Very Glee Christmas" [...] for [...] "shining in this storyline" [...] as Coach Beiste: [...] "Her {{scene as}} Santa, {{and then her}} knowing {{expression}} <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> Artie walk, were the best moments of the episode." [...] The Atlantic Patrick Burns agreed: Jones's [...] "performance as the Santa Claus bearer of harsh reality was quite moving. It's nice to see her get to show her acting chops and refreshing to see her character's vulnerability." [...] Poniewozik also agreed, and said Jones [...] "has been remarkable", [...] "taking every ridiculous moment Glee has thrown at her and finding the true emotion {{at the core of}} the absurdity, which is what Glee at its best does." [...] A similar sentiment was expressed by VanDerWerff in his review of the following episode, [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle": [...] "I also like Coach Beiste because she’s one of the few characters who seems to grasp how insane some of this is. I always like when a show that frequently goes over the top introduces someone who’s able to undercut some of that ridiculousness." ...|$|E
500|$|Joel Keller of AOL TV {{wrote that}} [...] "the {{linchpin}} {{of the hour}} was Brittany's belief in Santa Claus." [...] The New York Post Jarett Wieselman called it [...] "adorably realized by actress Heather Morris", and Canning said she [...] "perfectly played up Brittany's innocence and joy surrounding everything Santa". Brown was less enthusiastic, and wrote that she was tiring of the [...] "look how dumb yet kind-hearted Brittany is" [...] plots. Keller approved of the Artie and Brittany coupling, {{and said it was}} [...] "way more fun to watch than Rachel and Finn and all their angst", and Canning felt that the episode's heart was Artie working to keep Brittany from becoming disillusioned about Santa. He also wrote, [...] "shining in this storyline was Dot Jones as Coach Bieste. Her scene as Santa, and then her knowing expression <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> Artie walk, were the best moments of the episode." [...] Burns agreed: [...] "Coach Bieste's performance as the Santa Claus bearer of harsh reality was quite moving.

[...] Poniewozik also agreed, and said Jones [...] "has been remarkable", [...] "taking every ridiculous moment Glee has thrown at her and finding the true emotion {{at the core of the}} absurdity, which is what Glee at its best does." [...] However, he was disappointed by how the storyline played out: [...] "it didn't feel right that after the story the episode built around Brittany, it then felt that we needed to see Artie on his feet for it to be a truly happy ending." ...|$|E

[...] This infuriated Alice, who spat curse words at her television screen <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> him compare his early departure from the White House (in the face of probable impeachment and possible criminal prosecution) to her idealistic young father's loss of his wife and mother on the same day due to illness.

2500|$|The play {{provoked}} {{something of}} an upset. There were complaints about the [...] "horrific" [...] content (particularly the infamous Room 101 scene where Smith is threatened with torture by rats) and the [...] "subversive" [...] nature of the play.

There was also {{a report in the}} Daily Express newspaper of 42-year-old Beryl Merfin of Herne Bay collapsing and dying <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> the production, under the headline [...] "Wife dies as she watches", allegedly from the shock of what she had seen. An anonymous reviewer in The Times wrote: [...] "Inevitably, in a dramatic presentation of the book much of the irony is lost; and the weakness of this television version was that concentrating on the action it reduced the ideological explanation so drastically that it robbed the story of at least half its power". It was a [...] "pictorial simplification" [...] of [...] "Orwell's vision". The writer, however, admired the performances of Cushing, Mitchell and Morell.|$|E
