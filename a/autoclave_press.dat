There are several out of autoclave technologies in current use including resin transfer molding RTM), Same Qualified Resin Transfer Molding (SQRTM), vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM), and balanced pressure fluid molding.

Weight and cost savings of 28 and 20 percent, respectively, are predicted {{by comparison with}} the production metallic aileron. The structural integrity of the design has been substantiated by analysis and static tests of subcomponents.

Simplicity in fabrication is a major factor in achieving low cost using advanced tooling and manufacturing methods such as net molding to size, draping, forming broadgoods, and cocuring components.

40|$|Stamp forming is a rapid {{manufacturing}} technology used to shape flat blanks of thermoplastic composite material into three-dimensional components. Currently, expensive <b>autoclave</b> and <b>press</b> consolidation {{are used to}} preconsolidate blanks. This study investigates the influence of preconsolidation on final consolidation quality after stamp forming and explores the potential of alternative blank manufacturing methods that could reduce part costs. Blanks were manufactured using various blank manufacturing methods and subsequently were stamp formed. The consolidation quality {{both before and after}} stamp forming was compared, where the focus was on void content as the main measure for consolidation quality. The void content was characterized through thickness and density measurements, as well as by microscopy analysis. Results indicate that preconsolidation quality does have an influence on the final consolidation quality. This is due to the severe deconsolidation and limited reconsolidation during stamp forming. Nevertheless, the potential of automated fiber placement and ultrasonic spot welding as alternative blank manufacturing methods was demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Adhesive bonding in the {{aerospace}} industry typically utilizes <b>autoclaves</b> or <b>presses</b> which have considerable thermal mass. As a consequence, the rates of heatup and cooldown of the bonded parts are limited and the total time and cost of the bonding process are often relatively high. Many of the adhesives themselves do not inherently require long processing times. Bonding could be performed rapidly if the heat was concentrated in the bond lines {{or at least in}} the adherends. Rapid Adhesive Bonding concepts are developed to utilize induction heating techniques to provide heat directly to the bond line and/or adherends without heating the entire structure, supports, and fixtures of a bonding assembly. Bonding times for specimens can be cut by a factor of 10 to 100 compared to standard <b>press</b> or <b>autoclave</b> bonding. The development of Rapid Adhesive Bonding for lap shear specimens (per ASTM D 1002 and D 3163), for aerospace panel or component bonding, and for field repair needs of metallic and advanced fiber reinforced polymeric-matrix composite structures is reviewed. Equipment and procedures are described for bonding and repairing thin sheets, simple geometries, and honeycomb core panels...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A die-less {{forming process}} is {{described}} which {{is intended to}} be an eco-nomical method for manufacturing large, complex-shaped components from thermoplastic matrix, continuous-fiber composite materials. The concept is specialized to tapered shapes which are singly curved, long in their straight direction, and of arbitrary variable cross section along their length. An array of universal, computer-controlled rollers generates such shapes from initially flat laminates or stacks of prepreg sheet. Heating and bending of the material are strictly local operations occurring only within a small active zone at any one instant, thereby eliminating the need for fixed tooling and for large <b>autoclaves</b> or <b>presses.</b> The rollers are controlled using a "kinematically admissible bending " algorithm which requires interply sliding only in the local hot zone. Despite the fact that all of the regions not being formed are cold and rigid, the fibers of the composite are not forced to change length. Experimental verification to date includes: (1) rapid, local, through-thickness induction heating of carbon fiber, polymer matrix composite workpieces, and (2) kinematically-admissible bending of preconsolidated thermoplastic matrix laminates to simple singly-curved shapes, using a "near-term demonstration " forming machine. Tension superim-posed during such bending operations {{has been shown to be}} useful for maintaining good fiber alignment...|$|R

Quickstep is a fluid filled, balanced pressure heated floating mold technology, which is recently developed in Perth, Western Australia for {{the manufacture of}} advanced composite components. Mode I and Mode II interlaminar fracture toughness tests, and nanoindentation creep tests on matrix materials show that the fast ramp rate of the Quickstep process provides mechanical properties {{comparable to that of}} autoclave at a lower cost for composite manufacturing. Low viscosity during ramping process and good fiber wetting are believed to be the reasons that this process produces composites with high delamination and creep-resistant properties.

40|$|A non-autoclave {{vacuum bag}} process using {{atmospheric}} pressure alone that {{eliminates the need}} for external pressure normally supplied by an <b>autoclave</b> or a <b>press</b> is an attractive method for composite fabrication. This type of process does not require large capital expenditures for tooling and processing equipment. In the molding cycle (temperature/pressure profile) for a given composite system, the vacuum application point has to be carefully selected to achieve the final consolidated laminate net shape and resin content without excessive resin squeeze-out. The traditional single-vacuum- bag (SVB) process is best suited for molding epoxy matrix based composites because of their superior flow and the absence of reaction by-products or other volatiles. Other classes of materials, such as polyimides and phenolics, generate water during cure. In addition, these materials are commonly synthesized as oligomers using solvents to facilitate processability. Volatiles (solvents and reaction byproducts) management therefore becomes a critical issue. SVB molding, without additional pressure, normally fails to yield void-free quality composites for these classes of resin systems. A double-vacuum- bag (DVB) process for volatile management was envisioned, designed and built at the NASA Langley Research Center. This experimental DVB process affords superior volatiles management compared to the traditional SVB process. Void-free composites are consistently fabricated as measured by C-scan and optical photomicroscopy for high performance polyimide and phenolic resins...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In a {{companion}} paper [1] a process model {{was developed for}} investigation of residual stress development during <b>autoclave</b> or hot <b>press</b> processing of thermosetting polymer matrix composites. Several material property characterization studies are re-quired as input to this model. The present paper summarizes {{the results of the}} character-ization studies required for input to the model and validation of the model is accomplished by the intermittent cure of unsymmetric cross-ply laminates in which the processing-induced residual curvatures are measured. An IM 6 / 3100 graphite/bismaleimide composite system was chosen for the study. Longi-tudinal and transverse mechanical properties were shown to increase during the cure cycle due to increase in matrix strength and stiffness and development of the fiber/matrix bond. Thermal strains were shown to remain relatively constant during cure. Chemical strains occur early in the cure cycle and are completed before cure is fully developed. The vis-coelastic mechanical response of BMI is strongly dependent on the cure state. At low cure states the creep response is quite significant. As full cure is approached, the material becomes predominantly elastic. Based on the measured input data, the viscoelastic analy-sis showed that the contribution of chemical strains to residual stress was less than 4 % for a typical cure cycle. A good correlation was obtained between model predictions and ex-perimental warpage data for the cure cycle investigated. at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on May 8, 2016 jcm. sagepub. comDownloaded fro...|$|R
40|$|Fibre {{reinforced}} {{composite materials}} are used extensively in today's industry. On one hand, the low-weight {{feature of this}} kind of material gives important advantages such as lower fuel consumption and lower amount of CO 2 emissions. On the other hand, corrosion and high temperature resistance has made them suitable for different type of environments. Composite materials are also assumed to grow significantly in automotive industry in near future. In these perspectives, especial attention has risen up towards development of advanced manufacturing technologies where higher production rate, lower cost and lower environmental issues are desired. To achieve this goal, numerical simulations and CAE tools are employed to predict the behavior of manufacturing methods with respect to the process optimization and the product properties. The focus of this research thesis is toward development of a framework for holistic modeling of fiber reinforced composites manufacturing. The manufacturing process can be considered as a fluid filled porous material, which can be described, on macro scale as well as micro scale, by the Theory of Porous Media (TPM). The TPM has been further enhanced by introducing the concept of phase compressibility of the biphasic mixture of solid and fluid, in order to describe the physical sub-processes happening in different scale. The model of the considered problem is then put forward to be solved by Finite Element Method (FEM). In the discretization of the numerical domain a quadratic six-node triangular element is used and a staggered solution procedure is chosen to solve the highly coupled problem in a finite strain regime. The most important challenges, that the numerical solution procedure is able to capture, are (1) modeling the compressible volumetrically-deformable fiber preform and the shape of membrane due to the different considered loading situations (2) the dual scale resin flow motion through the fibrous preform and the compaction of individual plies (3) deformation dependent permeability models (4) the free surface problem when the flow is moving with respect to a flow front velocity into the vacuum zone of the porous material. The framework that is developed here is capable of simulating different manufacturing processes based on the chosen initial conditions, boundary conditions and material parameters. Liquid Composite Molding (LCM), Liquid Resin Infusion (LRI), Resin Transfer Molding (RTM), Out of <b>Autoclave</b> (OoA), <b>press</b> forming prepregs, Engineering Vacuum Channels (EvaC) and similar manufacturing methods are some examples of the processes that have been simulated...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Processing and {{properties}} of composite-to-composite bonding using Scotch-WeldTM AF- 555 M structural adhesive were investigated. Bonding surfaces of T 800 H/ 3900 - 2 composite were prepared by co-curing the dry and wet peel-plies. Surface topologies of the peel-plies and the co-cured composite surfaces were examined by microscopy, contour mapping using a {{coordinate measuring machine}} equipped with a ruby sphere probe, and contact angle goniometry. Curing of the adhesive was conducted in an <b>autoclave</b> or vacuum <b>press</b> at 1778 C (3508 F) for 2 h under 310 KPa (45 psi). Common bagging practices for composite fabrication in an autoclave were followed. It was found that a prolonged vacuum application (i. e., overnight) prior to the application of temperature and pressure was a critical element to produce porosity-free, high-quality bonds with this adhesive system. Following this procedure, a strong bond line was consistently produced, which routinely provided a single-lap shear strength more than 10 % higher than the nominal value of the adhesive (i. e., 35. 9 MPa or 5200 psi) when tested at room temperature. An adhesive failure mode at the interface was noted on the fractured surfaces of specimens with strong bonds whereas a premature cohesive failure mode was more evident for the specimens with weaker bonds, probably due to porosities in the bond lines. Photomicrographs showed that the weak single-lap shear strengths occurred on specimens with significant porosity in the bond line, apparently caused by entrapped air from insufficient vacuum application prior to curing. The {{results of this study}} are discussed herein. KEY WORDS: AF- 555 M adhesive, T 800 H/ 3900 - 2 composite, composite-to-composite adhesive bonding, single-lap shear strength...|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} {{completed}} at the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo Aerospace Engineering Structures and Composites Lab during Spring Quarter 2013. The {{purpose of this}} project was to research and to gain insight into the effects of fabrication methods and of modifying cure cycles for Newport NB- 301 12 l 2 x 2 Twill Weave Carbon Fiber material properties. The two fabrication methods used were <b>autoclave</b> and heat <b>press</b> (compression molding) methods. Each fabrication method used two cure cycles, a recommended cure cycle of 275 °F for 1 hour and a modified cure cycle of 250 °F for 1. 5 hours. The exact product data sheet of the composite used could not be found, this project attempted to generate an estimate for the missing material properties. To find tensile properties and flexural properties for each sample, testing was completed for the different cure methods. Material properties were found using the same standard of testing used by Newport Adhesives and Composites for their published data. The tensile standard used by Newport was ASTM D- 638 Type 1, however due {{to the complexity of}} manufacturing the samples a simpler standard was found (ASTM D- 3039). The flexure standard using for this project and by Newport was ASTM D- 790. After testing seven tensile samples and eight flexure samples {{for each of the four}} different configurations, it was concluded that for plate fabrication the compression molding method of the heat press resulted in the best material properties (highest modulus and highest ultimate strength. The best mechanical properties for tensile testing resulted from the recommended 275 °F cure cycle. The tensile mechanical properties that resulted from samples cured with the heat press at 275 °F had an average tensile strength of 85. 5 ksi (590 Mpa) and an average tensile modulus of 7. 08 Msi (48. 8 GPa). Unfortunately the flexure testing was not effective in displaying a clear trend for the best cure cycle. Thus no conclusion could be drawn to determine the best curing cycle for flexure...|$|R
40|$|The {{records of}} 40 867 men {{employed}} {{for at least}} one year in the rubber and cablemaking industries have now been observed for eight years. This analysis compares the mortality pattern for 1972 - 74 with that previously reported for 1968 - 71. It indicates a significant excess of deaths due to cancer of the bladder throughout the industry including men who had not been exposed to acknowledged bladder carcinogens. This excess is in deaths occurring in 1973 and 1974 in the 45 - 64 and 65 years plus age groups. The two sectors of the industry where this excess is significant are footwear and footwear supplies except adhesives, and the tyre sector. The excess of all cancers taken together previously noted throughout the study population for 1968 - 71 is confirmed for 1972 - 74 as is the excess for lung cancers. The greater excess in the tyre sector is also confirmed, particularly in those men in the 55 - 64 year age group and those who entered the industry between 1950 and 1960. While men employed in 1967 on moulding, <b>press,</b> <b>autoclave,</b> and pan curing, and workers in finished goods, stores, packaging, and despatch continue to have more lung cancer deaths than expected for 1972 - 74, the excess is no longer statistically significant. An excess of cancer of the stomach which was overlooked in 1968 - 71 is not confirmed in 1972 - 74 but is nevertheless high when the total period of study 1968 - 74 is considered. The limitations of the study are discussed with particular reference to extrapolating the results to the whole industry. We conclude that there is a higher rate of lung cancer in the tyre sector of the industry and that immediate investigations are required to test the hypothesis concerning the recent excess of bladder cancers. Attention should now be paid to the control of exposures to all potential hazards in the industry...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringThermal, rheological, and {{mechanical}} properties of a polymer composite cured at different one-stage and two-stage cure cycles were studied in this dissertation. A commercial carbon-fiber prepreg, Cycom 977 - 2 UD, was used. This curing-toughened epoxy resin prepreg is formulated for <b>autoclave</b> or <b>press</b> molding. An encapsulated sample rheometer (ESR) {{was used to}} obtain its viscoelastic properties, including complex viscosity, gel time, and minimum viscosity time, as well as glass transition temperature (Tg) and pressure window time for onestage and two-stage cure cycles. A differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was used to obtain the degree of cure (DOC) for one-stage and two-stage cure cycles. The mechanical properties of interest for specimens cured at one-stage cure cycles were short beam shear (SBS) strength, combined loading compression (CLC) strength, CLC modulus, CLC Poisson’s ratio, open-hole compression (OHC) strength, and OHC modulus. The SBS, CLC, and OHC tests were performed at room temperature to obtain the mechanical properties. For the one-stage cure cycles studied, {{it was observed that}} the mechanical properties, except SBS strength, did not vary significantly; therefore, no correlation with the viscoelastic properties or the DOC was found for them. Moreover, the failure mode for OHC specimens cured at different one-stage cure cycles was similar. Likewise, the failure mode for CLC specimens cured at different one-stage cure cycles was the same. However, the failure mode for the least-cured SBS specimens was different from that of other SBS specimens. Also, the SBS strength of the least-cured specimens was significantly less than that of other specimens. The complex viscosity of the specimens cured at one-stage cure cycles in the ESR showed a similar drop-off trend for the least-cured specimens. As such, SBS strength showed a good correlation with the complex viscosity. SBS strength showed a weaker correlation with the Tg and DOC for vii the same cure cycles. The Tg had a strong correlation with the DOC for all one-stage cure cycles. No correlation between gel time and other material properties was found. A considerable improvement in SBS strength, final complex viscosity, Tg, and DOC of the least-cured specimens was observed after the dwell time was increased enough to ensure that no further curing occurred. It was also observed that for the two-stage cure cycles, faster heat-up rates and higher first-stage dwell temperatures resulted in faster curing. The DOC for the entire cure cycle was modeled using the Springer-Loos cure kinetics model for one-stage and two-stage cure cycles. The complex viscosity up to the gel time was modeled using the Kenny viscosity model for one-stage and two-stage cure cycles. The modeling results agreed well with the experimental data. The results presented in this dissertation suggest that the ESR can be used as an ex-situ cure-monitoring instrument to mimic autoclave/oven curing and, hence, eliminate the need for multiple measurement instruments. The cure time-temperature data, provided by thermocouples attached to the composite part in the autoclave/oven would be the only input to the rheometer for cure monitoring. The complex viscosity as measured by the ESR was shown to be the best viscoelastic property for monitoring the state of the material during cure for the following reasons: (a) it could be precisely measured throughout the cure and post-cure cycles using the rheometer, (b) it could reveal the important changes in the material state during cure, (c) it could be modeled by sophisticated viscosity models, and (d) it could be correlated to the mechanical properties of the composite material. Utilizing the ESR as the main ex-situ cure-monitoring instrument makes it possible to offer a new approach to curing composites. In this new approach, called Material State Management (MSM), the acceptance of cured composite materials is based on the materials’ viscoelastic properties as measured by the ESR during cure and post-cure monitoring. Moreover, knowledge of the material’s viscoelastic properties during cure can be used to improve the current cure specifications. In the MSM approach, cure process confidence limits can be prescribed based on the viscoelastic properties of the material, thus addressing the shortcomings of the current time-temperature approach to curing...|$|R
