5|$|DuMont {{survived the}} early 1950s {{only because of}} WDTV in Pittsburgh, the lone {{commercial}} VHF station {{in what was then}} the sixth-largest market. WDTV's only competition came from UHF stations and distant stations from Johnstown, Pennsylvania; Youngstown, Ohio; and Wheeling, West Virginia. No other commercial VHF station signed on in Pittsburgh until 1957, giving WDTV a de facto monopoly on television in the <b>area.</b> <b>Since</b> WDTV carried secondary affiliations with the other three networks, DuMont used this as a bargaining chip to get its programs cleared in other large markets.|$|E

Overall impact from the cyclone was minor and largely limited to light rainfall. However, the precursor system spawned a damaging tornado in Eustis, Florida, where 20houses were destroyed and 30more were damaged.|$|E

5|$|One of many {{exceptions}} to Seattle's {{reputation as a}} damp location occurs in El Niño years, when marine weather systems track {{as far south as}} California and little precipitation falls in the Puget Sound <b>area.</b> <b>Since</b> the region's water comes from mountain snow packs during the dry summer months, El Niño winters can not only produce substandard skiing but can result in water rationing and a shortage of hydroelectric power the following summer.|$|E
5|$|People {{have lived}} in the <b>area</b> <b>since</b> around 1350 AD. Prior to European settlement, the region was sparsely {{inhabited}} by nomadic groups of Māori, most of whom lived close to river mouths.

Ecotourism has become of growing importance in the Catlins economy, which otherwise relies heavily on dairy farming and fishing.|$|E
