40|$|The {{construction}} industry is in great need of higher efficiency and {{the renewal of}} processes and of products is in slow progress. Imperfect communication and unstructured information is a barrier to work through, in order to progress. BIM, Building Information Model, is a contemporary model to improve {{the flow of information}} among participants in construction projects. In infrastructure projects in Sweden there are very little experience in how to use BIM. However, in other construction projects, such as housing, the use of BIM has shown great improvements on effectiveness. In theory, similar result can be expected in infrastructure projects as well. This master thesis is written for Trafikverket and is accomplished as an interview-study with a total of 12 participants from client-, contractor- and consulting companies in the infrastructure industry. The purpose with this thesis is to find out how BIM can be used in planning and practice of infrastructure projects. The aim is to discover possibilities and problems in how to implement the model within Trafikverket. The analysis shows that parts of the industry are not concordant in what BIM is about because {{there is a lack of}} a common definition and information about BIM have not reached all participants. This thesis shows that the most useful areas of BIM in infrastructure construction projects are; communication, machine control, mass handling, calculation, time planning, visualizing and controlling such as collision control. Finally BIM may be used as a record for administration. Multiple obstacles for implementation have been brought to the surface in this thesis. The obstacles mainly concern the legal status, the application limits and the indistinct requirements for establishing a 3 D-model. A conclusion in this thesis is that BIM serves as a common platform that is updated continuously and therefore creates benefits for Trafikverket. The platform can be used throughout the lifecycle of the infrastructure object, from design to administration. Design will become more effective, maintain a higher quality and less errors. BIM might also contribute to a better production process due to the project implementation and project vision shown in the model. In the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> BIM might be used as a database containing information about upcoming maintenance work as well as future new constructions and reconstructions.

40|$|Frequently in the past, {{attempts}} have been made to systematize the notion of judicial review of administrative action. Thus, the Donoughmore Commission proposed the judicial, quasi-judicial, purely administrative model of analysis. The Commission was severely criticized, especially after the implementation of certain recommendations of the Franks Report which, in improving the quality of the control exercised on administrative tribunals, underscored the ridiculous character of that existing in other fields. The most violent criticisms came certainly from Griffith and Street, and also from Professor Wade who denounced the progressive atrophy of natural justice, the latter being the main topic of the present article. That concept, distinguished from "procedural ultra vires" in that a judge may look beyond the law for rules he himself has set establishing certain procedural guarantees, goes back a long way in time. Nevertheless, it is not a panacea. Its scope is limited to the study of the means whereby a decision is reached; it does not examine the conclusion, but rather how that conclusion is determinded. The usefulness of the notion was diminished when a condition of its application, the duty to act judicially, was added. Ridge v. Baldwin put the pieces of the puzzle back into place by discarding the decisions which gave the concept a much too restrictive interpretation. These first steps of the fairness concept were rapidly followed in matters concerning the allocation of licences. Judicial intervention here dates back to the last century. Yet, the Nakkuda Ali and Parker decisions restrained the spread of control through an erroneous interpretation of an opinion by Lord Atkin. Both decisions were overturned by the Ridge case. Later on, it seems that Lord Denning took the lead in a movement aimed at extending the scope of the duty to act fairly. That principle received its modem da consecration in the Crockford's decision and was used later in other decisions of a like nature. The late professor de Smith remarked this new tendency to go beyond the words to see, in the matter at issue, what is fair and what is not. Domestic tribunals, not in union matters alone (Breen) but also in sports problems (Machin), have also had this obligation to act fairly imposed on them, even though, strictly speaking, they do not have judicial powers. The question is rather to know whether a legitimate expectation of the person involved in the decision is brought into play, although the extend of the obligation varies depending on the circumstances of the case. It would appear that there is continued refusal to intervene in matters of labour contracts when faced with a purely master and servant relation (Sylva). But now the complete absence of statutory guarantees is required (Malloch). Procedural guarantees have continued to evolve since then. More and more, in different areas, thanks to the initiative of judges like Lord Denning, a system of English administrative law has developed. The principle of the existence of more or less defined minimal procedural guarantees has been established, no matter whether the administrative act implies the exercise of judicial power or not. Yet, British courts still refuse to intervene in legislative functions, including regulations issuing from statutory committees, even should the legislative instrument result from false representations. Control over immigration matters has become increasingly tightened, even though, at one time, there was an apparent desire to sanctify the absolute character of the discretion exercised in that field. The widening ofthat control came about as much from legislative changes as from judicial decisions. Thus it is that in the Re H. K. decision, there was established the duty to act fairly on the part of an immigration officer who might wish to turn a person back at the border whom he considers to be inadmissible. Soon (if it has not already happened) Britons will also benefit from procedural guarantees in matters of land planning. A recent decision made use of the fairness concept in that field. English courts have undertaken to sanctify fundamental procedural guarantees. The name, the scope and the extent of these rules has varied and continues to vary. It would seem, however, that there is a desire to leave the categorization of the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> to one side in favour of dealing with the consequences of an act for the individual. If a decision touches an interest, an vested right, or a legitimate expectation, the citizen is entitled to have certain minimal procedural guarantees respected, which may vary according to the circumstances, but which always involve the determination of what is fair in the particular instance. It is a necessary adaptation to the new reality of administration, something we hope to see come about in the very near future in Canada...|$|E
40|$|O efeito antibacteriano de Ãleos essenciais extraÃdos de folhas das espÃcies de Lippia aff. {{gracilis}} e Lippia gracilis frente a cepa de Staphylococcus aureus isolada de Ãlcera de paciente com pÃ diabÃtico foi avaliado mediante experimentaÃÃo {{in vitro}} e in vivo, utilizando-se o modelo experimental de ratos diabÃticos aloxano induzidos. Cento e doze ratos machos Wistar diabÃticos com peso mÃdio de 180 g foram distribuÃdos ao acaso em dois experimentos. Cada experimento foi dividido em dois procedimentos que avaliaram a atividade antibacteriana de soluÃÃes dos Ãleos essenciais a 5 %, em dois diferentes procedimentos: um no ato da administraÃÃo do inÃculo bacteriano e outro apÃs vinte e quatro horas de administraÃÃo. A administraÃÃo tanto do inÃculo 108 ufc/ml quanto da suspensÃo dos Ãleos foi por via subcutÃnea no membro pÃlvico dos ratos diabÃticos. CinqÃenta e seis ratos Wistar foram utilizados para cada experimento, no qual os mesmos foram distribuÃdos ao acaso em 8 (oito) diferentes grupos: 4 grupos por experimento, apresentando 7 ratos por grupo (G 1 -Branco; G 2 -Controle negativo; G 3 -Controle positivo; G 4 -Teste). Foi verificado que no procedimento 1 (S. aureus sem Lippia aff gracilis 108 Â 698 versus S. aureus com Lippia aff gracilis 293, 1 Â 79, 07; S. aureus sem Lippia gracilis 108 Â 873 versus S. aureus com Lippia gracilis 302 Â 57, 2) e no procedimento 2 (S. aureus sem Lippia aff gracilis 108 Â 313 versus S. aureus com Lippia aff gracilis 13, 28 Â 4, 03; S. aureus sem Lippia gracilis 108 Â 818 versus S. aureus com Lippia gracilis 13, 14 Â 4, 27); houve reduÃÃo na contagem bacteriana tanto para Lippia aff. gracilis quanto para Lippia gracilis. Quando comparados os grupos G 4 com G 3, observou-se que esta suspensÃo a 5 % nÃo apresentou efeito prÃ-inflamatÃrio. Para a validaÃÃo destes resultados, foram utilizados os testes Mann-Whitney e Bartletts &Newman-Keuls (MÃdia Â - E. P. M) com nÃvel de significÃncia de (p< 0, 05). Ainda neste estudo foi avaliado a aÃÃo antioxidante e imunomoduladora da L-glutamina em modelos de ratos Wistar diabÃticos quando administrada por gavagem a uma concentraÃÃo de 0, 7 g/kg em um perÃodo de 30 dias. Quarenta ratos Wistar machos foram distribuÃdos ao acaso em 5 grupos (GI-nÃo diabÃtico; GII-diabÃtico; GIII-diabÃtico com salina; GIV-diabÃtico com L-glutamina; GV-diabÃtico com ProteÃna do Soro do Leite). Passado este perÃodo, foram determinadas as concentraÃÃes de substÃncias reativas ao Ãcido tiobarbitÃrico (TBARS) e glutationa reduzida (GSH) no soro e nos tecidos hepÃticos, pancreÃticos, mÃsculo esquelÃtico, rins e tecido adiposo. Para as comparaÃÃes entre o grupo tratado com L-glutamina com os demais, utilizou-se a anÃlise de variÃncia (ANOVA-teste Tukey). As comparaÃÃes entre grupos foram feitas utilizando-se o teste t de Student. Valores de p< 0, 05 foram considerados significantes. A suplementaÃÃo com L-glutamina induziu ao aumento nas concentraÃÃes de GSH (MÃdia Â E. P. M) e reduÃÃo significante nas concentraÃÃes de TBARS (MÃdia Â E. P. M), quando comparadas com o grupo controle, nos espÃcimes analisados. A aÃÃo imunomoduladora foi avaliada atravÃs da quantificaÃÃo de linfÃcitos CD 4 + e CD 8 + em sangue total. Vinte e quatro ratos Wistar machos diabÃticos foram distribuÃdos igualmente em 3 grupos (G 1 -diabÃtico com salina; G 2 -diabÃtico com L-glutamina; G 3 - diabÃtico com ProteÃna do Soro do Leite). Observou-se um aumento significante nas populaÃÃes de linfÃcitos CD 4 + (MÃdia Â E. P. M) com reduÃÃo nas populaÃÃes de linfÃcitos CD 8 + (MÃdia Â -E. P. M) do grupo G 2 quando comparado com o grupo controle, ressaltando a importÃncia da L-glutamina como imunonutrienteThe antibacterial effect of essential oils extracted from {{leaves of the}} species of Lippia aff. gracilis and Lippia gracilis against strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from patients with diabetic foot ulcers were evaluated in vitro and in vivo experimetation utilizing an experimental model of alloxan-induced diabetic rats. One hundred and twelve male diabetic Wistar rats with mean weight of 180 g were distributed by chance into two experiments. Each experiment was divided in two procedures with evaluation of antibacterial activity of essential oils at 5 % solutions; one procedure in the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> of bacterial inoculums {{and the other one}} 24 hours later. 108 CFU (Colony Forming Unit) /mL, as well as oils suspension inoculated in the subcutaneous tissue of the pelvic member of diabetic rats. Lower than 5 % concentration of administered solution presented antibacterial effect in the in vitro experiment. Fifty-six Wistar rats were utilized in each experiment, randomly distributed in 08 different groups: 04 groups per experiment, each group with 07 rats (G 1 -White; G 2 -Negative Control; G 3 - Positive control; G 4 -Test). There was decrease in CFU/mL in procedure 1 (S. aureus without Lippia aff gracilis 108 Â 698 versus S. aureus with Lippia aff gracilis 293, 1 Â 9, 07; S. aureus without Lippia gracilis 108 Â 873 versus S. aureus with Lippia gracilis 302 Â 57, 2), which evaluated antibacterial effect of oils concomitantly with the administration of inocula as well as in procedure 2 (S. aureus without Lippia aff gracilis 108 Â 313 versus S. aureus with Lippia aff gracilis 13, 28 Â 4, 03; S. aureus without Lippia gracilis 108 Â 818 versus S. aureus with Lippia gracilis 13, 14 Â 4, 27), which evaluated antibacterial effect of oils 24 hours after the administration of the inoculum. When comparing group G 4 with G 3, it was observed that 5 % solution presented no pro-inflammatory effect, for analysis of these results, the tests of Mann-Whitney and Bartletts & Newman-Keuls (X Â S. E. M) with level of significance (p< 0, 05) were used. Part of this study evaluated the antioxidant and immunomodulating effect of L-glutamine in models of Wistar diabetic rats when administered by gavages at a 0, 7 g/kg during 30 days. Fourty Wistar male rats were randomly distributed in 5 groups (GI- non diabetic; GII-diabetic; GIII-diabetic with saline; GIV- diabetic with L-glutamine; GV- diabetic with Whey Protein). After 30 days concentrations of TBARS and GSH in serum and in hepatic, pancreatic, skeletal muscles, kidneys and fat tissues were determined. For comparisons between the group treated with L-glutamine with the others, the ANOVA â Tukey test was utilized and the comparisons between groups were done using Studentâs t test. Values of p< 0. 05 were considered significant. The supplementation with L-glutamine induced an increase in the concentrations of GSH (Mean&# 61617;S. E. M) and significant reduction in the TBARS (mean Â S. E. M) concentrations, when compared to the control group, in the analyzed specimens. The immunomodulating effect was evaluated by quantification of CD 4 + and CD 8 + lymphocytes in total blood. Twenty-four Wistar male diabetic rats were distributed equally in 3 groups (G 1 -diabetic with saline; G 2 -diabetic with L-glutamine; G 3 - diabetic with Whey Protein). It was seen a significant increase of CD 4 + (mean Â S. E. M) lymphocytes with reduction of CD 8 + (mean Â S. E. M) lymphocytes in group G 2 when compared to the control group, showing the importance of L-glutamine as an immunonutrien...|$|E

40|$|The <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> the {{temporal}} goods as {{a space of}} liberty for the Canonical legal system. ” is both the title and {{the subject matter of}} this doctoral thesis. The topic, which represents a clear example of res mixtae, is analyzed {{from the perspective of the}} Canonical legal system, seeking to give an original and complete review of the juridical terms by means of which the Catholic Church vindicates for itself the right to administrate its temporal goods. The analysis starts from the Canon 1254 of the current Codex Iuris Canonici, which recognizes the ius pubblicum ecclesiasticum principle according to which the Catholic Church by innate right is able to acquire, retain, administer and alienate temporal goods in order to pursue its proper purposes In particular, this provision is considered under the profile of the historical evolution that led to the current wording as well as in its dogmatic meaning and in the implications with the current Canonical legal system. After having defined – through the analysis of this provision – the space of patrimonial freedom that the Catholic Church asks for itself, the thesis deals with the provisions of the Book V, Title II of the Codex Iuris Canonici, which are dedicated to the <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> {{the temporal}} goods belonging to the Catholic Church. Firstly it considers the subjects involved at any title in the <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> ecclesiastical goods (such as the Roman Pontiff, the Ordinary, the Immediate Administrator, the finance officer, the finance council and the conference of bishops). Secondly it pays attention to the different <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> (transactions which can worsen the stable patrimony of the owner legal entity, <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> ordinary and extraordinary administration, maioris momenti acts). Finally, the thesis deals with the pathology <b>of</b> the <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> in the Canonical legal system, with regard both to the effects of the invalidity and the deriving responsibility, and with the relationships between the provisions of the Title II and the Italian legal system...|$|R
