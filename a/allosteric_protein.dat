40|$|Many sensory systems, from {{vision and}} hearing in animals to signal {{transduction}} in cells, respond to fold changes in signal relative to background.

Thus, repressor with inducer bound is stabilized in the non-DNA-binding conformation. However, this simple model cannot be the whole story, because repressor is bound quite stably to DNA, yet it is released rapidly by addition of inducer. Therefore, it seems clear that inducer can also bind to the repressor when the repressor is already bound to DNA. It is still not entirely known what the exact mechanism of binding is.|$|E

40|$|Much of the {{complexity}} of biochemical networks comes from the information-processing abilities of allosteric proteins, be they receptors, ion-channels, signalling molecules or transcription factors. An <b>allosteric</b> <b>protein</b> can be uniquely regulated by each combination of input molecules that it binds. This "regulatory complexity" causes a combinatorial {{increase in the number of}} parameters required to fit experimental data as the number of protein interactions increases. It therefore challenges the creation, updating, and re-use of biochemical models. Here, we propose a rule-based modelling framework that exploits the intrinsic modularity of protein structure to address regulatory complexity. Rather than treating proteins as "black boxes", we model their hierarchical structure and, as conformational changes, internal dynamics. By modelling the regulation of allosteric proteins through these conformational changes, we often decrease the number of parameters required to fit data, and so reduce over-fitting and improve the predictive power of a model. Our method is thermodynamically grounded, imposes detailed balance, and also includes molecular cross-talk and the background activity of enzymes.

40|$|ABSTRACT Allosteric {{proteins}} {{have been}} stud-ied {{extensively in the}} last 40 years, but so far, no systematic analysis of conformational changes bet-ween allosteric structures has been carried out. Here, we compile a set of 51 pairs of known inac-tive and active <b>allosteric</b> <b>protein</b> structures from the Protein Data Bank. We calculate local confor-mational {{differences between the two}} structures of each protein using simple metrics, such as backbone and side-chain Cartesian displacement, and torsion angle change and rearrangement in residue–residue contacts. Thresholds for each met-ric arise from distributions of motions in two con-trol sets of pairs of protein structures in the same biochemical state. Statistical analysis of motions in allosteric proteins quantifies the magnitude of allosteric effects and reveals simple structural principles about allostery. For example, allosteric proteins exhibit substantial conformational changes comprising about 20 % of the residues. In addition, motions in allosteric proteins show strong bias to-ward weakly constrained regions such as loops and the protein surface. Correlation functions show that motions communicate through protein structures over distances averaging 10 – 20 residues in sequence space and 10 – 20 A ̊ in Cartesian space. Comparison of motions in the allosteric set and a set of 21 nonallos-teric ligand-binding proteins shows that nonallos-teric proteins also exhibit bias of motion toward weakly constrained regions and local correlation of motion. However, allosteric proteins exhibit twice as much percent motion on average as nonallosteric proteins with ligand-induced motion.

Although we observe a large diversity of functioning cooperative architectures (including shear, hinge and twist designs), they all obey the same principle of nearly displaying a mechanism, i. e. an extended zero mode.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Potential blood {{substitutes}} can {{be based on}} hemoglobin. Two problems must be overcome with acellular hemoglobin-based {{blood substitutes}}, however: the oxygen affinity of purified human hemoglobin is too high for it to deliver oxygen to tissues, and hemoglobin tetramers dissociate into αβ dimers that can cause kidney damage. A modified form of hemoglobin, rHb 1. 1, has reduced oxygen affinity {{as the result of}} an Asnβ 108 →Lys mutation, and dimerization is prevented by the insertion of a glycine residue between the sequences of the normal α chains to produce one covalently continuous di-α-chain. Determination of the structure of rHb 1. 1 would provide structure-based explanations for the altered properties of rHb 1. 1. Results: We determined the structures of the deoxy form of rHb 1. 1 at 2. 0 Å resolution and of cyanomet-rHb 1. 1 at 2. 6 Å resolution. Deoxy-rHb 1. 1 adopts the classic ‘T state’ quaternary structure, but cyanomet-rHb 1. 1 adopts a novel quanternary structure, the B state. The most striking feature of the tertiary structures is a charged hydrogen bond involving Lysβ 108 that is broken in the T→B state transition. The glycine bridge within the di-α-chain is well defined in both structures and appears to cause adoption of the B state instead of the previously observed ligand-bound quaternary structures R or Y/R 2. Conclusions: A charged hydrogen bond between Lysβ 108 and Tyrβ 35 is broken in the transition between the deoxy and ligand-bound forms of rHb 1. 1. This structural change reduces the oxygen affinity of rHb 1. 1 by changing the relative stability of deoxy and ligand-bound states. Furthermore, our observations highlight the importance of small conformational changes in <b>allosteric</b> <b>proteins,</b> even in their most rigid domains. Three ligand-bound quaternary structures of hemoglobin (R, Y/R 2 and B) have now been described. In contrast, only one quaternary structure has been observed for deoxyhemoglobin (T). The structural degeneracy of the high oxygen affinity form of hemoglobin is an important reminder that <b>allosteric</b> <b>proteins</b> may have multiple quaternary structures that are functionally very similar. This degeneracy of quaternary structures has important implications for the regulation of <b>allosteric</b> <b>proteins,</b> because different quaternary structures may be stabilized by different allosteric effectors...|$|R
