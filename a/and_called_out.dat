5|$|Edwards had {{not been}} {{governor}} long when Illinois became the scene of fighting during the War of 1812. Relations between Illinois settlers and Native Americans worsened throughout the territory during 1810 and 1811. By June 1811, Governor Edwards ordered {{the construction of a}} series of blockhouses <b>and</b> <b>called</b> <b>out</b> three companies of militia.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} epithet nidiformis {{is derived}} from the Latin terms nīdus 'nest' and forma 'shape' or 'form', hence 'nest shaped'. Lampas {{is derived from}} the Greek lampas/λαμπας 'torch'. Common names include ghost fungus and Australian glow fungus. Drummond reported that the local aborigines were fearful when shown the luminescent fungus <b>and</b> <b>called</b> <b>out</b> chinga, a local word for spirit; Drummond himself likened it to a will-o'-the-wisp. Likewise on the Springbrook Plateau in southeastern Queensland, the local Kombumerri people believed the lights to be ancestors and gave the area a wide berth out of respect.|$|E
5|$|A {{little over}} {{an hour after the}} committee's meeting, Governor Taylor {{declared}} a state of insurrection <b>and</b> <b>called</b> <b>out</b> the state militia. He called the legislature into special session, not in Frankfort, but in heavily Republican London, which he insisted was a safer location. Defiant Democratic legislators refused to heed the call to London, but when they attempted to convene first in the state capitol and later in other public locations in Frankfort, they found the doors barred by armed citizens. On January 31, 1900, they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel, with no Republicans present, and voted to certify the findings of the contest committee, invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor. Goebel was sworn in, and immediately ordered the state militia to stand down. He also ordered the General Assembly to reconvene in Frankfort. The Republican militia refused to disband, and a rival Democratic militia formed across the lawn of the state capitol. Civil war seemed possible.|$|E

5|$|In September 2017, former IBF middleweight {{champion}} David Lemieux {{made himself}} available as Cotto's final opponent, which {{would take place}} on December 2, 2017 on HBO at Madison Square Garden. According to a source, regardless of who Cotto fights, Lemieux would still appear on the card. Also in September, three-weight world champion Mikey Garcia took to social media <b>and</b> <b>called</b> <b>out</b> Cotto for a fight in December. On September 21, he reiterated his desire to move up to 154 to be Cotto's final foe. Cotto's trainer was also open for the fight to take place. On October 7, ESPN reported that terms were agreed for Cotto's final fight against former Olympian and world welterweight title challenger Sadam Ali (25-1, 14 KOs) to take place on December 2 at Madison Square Garden. Information {{in regards to the}} contracted weight of the fight wasn't discussed at this point.|$|E
5|$|Mark Teixeira {{tied the}} game with a solo home run in the fourth inning, and Hideki Matsui broke the tie in the sixth with another solo homer. Martínez {{departed}} the game after giving up consecutive hits to Jerry Hairston, Jr. and Melky Cabrera to start the seventh inning, and reliever Chan Ho Park gave up an RBI single to Jorge Posada. With Cabrera at second base and Posada at first, Johnny Damon hit a low line drive at Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard. Howard grabbed the ball and threw to second where Posada was tagged <b>and</b> <b>called</b> <b>out</b> while standing on the base. First-base umpire Brian Gorman ruled that Howard had caught the ball in the air and thus the result was an inning-ending double play. This was the first of two calls by Gorman in this game which were later shown to have been wrong by video replays.|$|E
5|$|That evening, {{his wounds}} became infected; he {{suffered}} a strong fever and septicemia set in. His doctors considered amputating his leg, but none wished {{to take responsibility for}} so drastic an act. On 19 October, he became delirious <b>and</b> <b>called</b> <b>out</b> for his mother, but the Greek government refused to allow her to re-enter the country from exile in Switzerland, despite her own protestations. Finally, the queen dowager, Olga, George I's widow and Alexander's grandmother, was allowed to return alone to Athens to tend to the king. She was delayed by rough waters, however, and by the time she arrived, Alexander had already died of sepsis twelve hours previously at a little after 4 p.m. on 25 October 1920. The other {{members of the royal family}} received the news by telegram that night.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the Civil War, the {{territorial}} governor was Abraham Rencher; although a Democrat from North Carolina, he refused to support secession, <b>and</b> <b>called</b> <b>out</b> the territorial militia to counteract the Confederate invasion of July 1861. That month he was replaced by Henry Connelly, a native of New Mexico who would serve as governor {{for the remainder of the}} war.

At the proclamation ceremony, an elections commissioner introduced Pacquiao as the people's champion <b>and</b> <b>called</b> <b>out</b> his name in the same slow style that he is introduced in his world-famous bouts, drawing cheers from the audience. Pacquiao garnered more than 16 million votes, landing 7th among 12 new members of the Senate.|$|E
25|$|From {{the night}} of the event, Alexander I was {{suffering}} from high fever: his wound had become infected and soon developed into septicaemia. With the rapid evolution of his illness, doctors planned to amputate his leg but no one wanted to take responsibility for such an act. Operated seven times, he was cared for only by Aspasia during the four weeks which lasted his agony. Under the effect of the blood poisoning, the young King suffered terribly and his cries of pain were heard in the entire Royal Palace. On 19 October he became delirious <b>and</b> <b>called</b> <b>out</b> for his mother. However, the Greek government refused to allow Queen Sophia to re-enter the country. In St. Moritz, where she was exiled {{with the rest of the}} royal family, the Queen begged the Hellenic authorities to let her take care of her son but Venizelos remained adamant. Finally, Dowager Queen Olga, widow of George I, was allowed to travel alone to Athens to be with her grandson. But delayed by rough seas, she arrived two hours after the King's death, on 25 October 1920. Informed by telegram that night, other members of the royal family learned of the death with sadness.|$|E

Steen was then confronted by Jim Cornette and ROH president Cary Silkin, whom he tried to Package Piledrive, before being ushered out of the arena by the security. On the November 5 episode of Ring of Honor Wrestling, Steen reappeared with Ohio Valley Wrestling talent Christian Mascagni as his legal adviser, threatening Jim Cornette and Ring of Honor with legal action unless he was reinstated within three weeks. On the December 3 episode of Ring of Honor Wrestling, Steen was granted a match with Steve Corino at Final Battle 2011, with his ROH future on the line. At the event, Steen defeated Corino, thus granting back his career in ROH. Afterwards, he delivered a package piledriver to Jimmy Jacobs, before putting El Generico through a table with the same maneuver. At the end of the evening, he confronted Davey Richards and promised to become the ROH World Champion in 2012. On March 4, 2012, at the 10th Anniversary Show, Steen defeated Jimmy Jacobs in a No Holds Barred match and ended the pay-per-view by having another confrontation with Davey Richards. Steen continued his win streak during the Showdown in the Sun weekend, first defeating El Generico, with help from Jimmy Jacobs, in a Last Man Standing match on March 30 and then Eddie Edwards in a singles match on March 31. On May 12 at Border Wars, Steen defeated Davey Richards to win the ROH World Championship for the first time, making him the first Canadian to hold the championship.|$|E
500|$|A British officer (probably Pitcairn, but {{accounts}} are uncertain, {{as it may}} also have been Lieutenant William Sutherland) then rode forward, waving his sword, <b>and</b> <b>called</b> <b>out</b> for the assembled militia to disperse, and may also have ordered them to [...] "lay down your arms, you damned rebels!" [...] Captain Parker told his men instead to disperse and go home, but, because of the confusion, the yelling all around, and due to the raspiness of Parker's tubercular voice, some did not hear him, some left very slowly, and none laid down their arms. Both Parker and Pitcairn ordered their men to hold fire, but a shot was fired from an unknown source.|$|E
500|$|Fearing Democrats in the Assembly would [...] "steal" [...] the election, {{armed men}} came to Frankfort from various {{areas of the}} state, {{primarily}} Eastern Kentucky, which was heavily Republican. On January 30, Goebel was shot while entering the state capitol building. Taylor {{declared a state of}} emergency <b>and</b> <b>called</b> <b>out</b> the militia. He called a special session of the legislature, holding it in heavily Republican London, Kentucky rather than the capital. Democrats refused to heed the call, and met in Democratic-dominated Louisville instead. They certified the election commission's report that disqualified enough Taylor votes for Goebel to be declared the winner of the election. Shortly after being sworn in as governor, Goebel died from the gunshot wound he had received days earlier.|$|E

500|$|Having {{collected}} {{water from}} the nearby village, MacLaren and his companions were almost back at the crash site {{when they heard the}} shots. Thinking it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in the heat, they continued on their way, <b>and</b> <b>called</b> <b>out</b> to the other passengers, who they thought were still alive. This alerted the insurgents to the presence of more survivors; one of the guerrillas told MacLaren's group to [...] "come here". The insurgents then opened fire on their general location, prompting MacLaren and the others to flee. Hill and the Hansens also ran; they revealed their positions to the fighters in their haste, but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge. After Hill and the others had hidden there for about two hours, they saw the attackers return to the crash site at about 19:45. The guerrillas looted the wrecked cabin and some of the suitcases strewn around the site, filled their arms with passengers' belongings, then left again.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of the album, Connary Fagen of Original Sound Version {{concluded}} that it was [...] "part masterpiece, part phone-in."

However, he felt that a few pieces, in particular the final three tracks, were [...] "underwhelming". He described the overall effect as [...] "a row of books with only one bookend" [...] as the album in his opinion did not have a strong or defined ending. Ben Schweitzer of Square Enix Music Online said that while [...] "the album as a whole is worthwhile", that it was [...] "in some ways like a wasted opportunity." [...] He felt {{that the majority of the}} tracks were short orchestrations that did not attempt to stray from the original material, which in his opinion meant that they were left to stand on the merits of the original compositions rather than their own merits. He did note that the quality of the orchestra was high, <b>and</b> <b>called</b> <b>out</b> [...] "Cage of Remorse and Relief" [...] and [...] "Soaring" [...] as especially well done.|$|E
