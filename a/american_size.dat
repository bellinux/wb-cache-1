40|$|This paper {{describes}} necessary {{elements for}} constructing theoretical models of network and system administration. Armed with a theoretical model it becomes {{possible to determine}} best practices and optimal strategies {{in a way which}} objectively relates policies and assumptions to results obtained. It is concluded that a mixture of automation and human, or other intelligent incursion is required to fully implement system policy with current technology. Some aspects of the author's immunity model for automated system administration are explained, as an example. A theoretical framework makes the prediction that the optimal balance between resource availability and garbage collection strategies is encompassed by the immunity model.

40|$|This {{research}} explores how young, plus-size female consumers {{engage with}} the process of enclothed cognition. It is believed that clothing inherently carries symbolism within the garment itself, which may then be transmitted to the wearer, such as the feeling of authority felt when wearing a business suit. Traditionally, plus-size consumers are considered to be individuals ages 30 - 40, wearing an <b>American</b> <b>size</b> 16 or above. However, this does not cover a key area of the plus-size demographic: young plus-size consumers. This research utilizes semi-structured narrative interviews to further explore young plus-size women 2 ̆ 7 s personal definitions of professionalism and the enclothing process. Results indicate that these women may have difficulties enclothing the garments currently offered by plus-size retailers, as they do not match personal definitions of professionalism. Retailers should aim to provide garments that encloth a larger demographic area to provide greater options to consumers...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{extended}} {{version of the}} talk given at 19 th Texas Symposium of Relativistic Astrophysics and Cosmology, Paris, 1998. It reviews of some recent work; mathematical details are skipped. It is well-known that a choice of gauge in generally covariant models has a twofold pupose: not only to render the dynamics unique, but also to define the spacetime points. A geometric way of choosing gauge that {{is not based on}} coordinate conditions [...] -the so-called covariant gauge fixing [...] -is described. After a covariant gauge fixing, the dynamics is unique and the background manifold points are well-defined, but the description remains invariant with respect to all diffeomorphisms of the background manifold. Transformations between different covariant gauge fixings form the well-known Bergmann-Komar group. Each covariant gauge fixing determines a so-called Kuchař decomposition. The construction of the quantum theory is based on the Kuchař form of the action and the Dirac method of operator constraints. It is demonstrated that the Bergmann-Komar group is too large to be implementable by unitary maps in the quantum domain.

40|$|A {{limited number}} of studies have been {{conducted}} in the literature in order to investigate the behaviour of high-strength fibre-reinforced concrete (HSFRC) structural components subjected to blast loads. This study summarizes the results of a research program investigating the potential of using steel fibres to improve the blast performance of high-strength reinforced concrete beams. As part of the experimental investigation twenty beams were tested, including nine beams tested under static four-point bending, and eleven beams tested under dynamic blast loads using a shock-tube. Parameters considered in the study include the effect of concrete strength, steel fibres, fibre content, fibre type, longitudinal reinforcement ratio, and presence of shear reinforcement. All beams in the study have identical dimensions, with a cross-section of 125 x 250 mm and length of 2440 mm. To manufacture the specimens, two beams were cast with normal-strength self-consolidate concrete (SCC), with a specified strength of 50 MPa, while the remaining beams were cast with either plain or fibre-reinforced high-strength concrete having a compressive strength which varied between 95 - 110 MPa. The steel fibre content in the HSFRC beams varied between 0. 5 and 1. 0 %, by volume of concrete. To investigate the effect of reinforcement ratio (ρ), the beams were reinforced with 2 -# 4 (<b>American</b> <b>size)</b> bars, 2 - 15 M bars or 2 - 20 M bars (ρ = 1. 02 %, 1. 59 %, and 2. 41 %, respectively). The majority of the plain concrete beams had transverse reinforcement which consisted of 6 mm stirrups arranged at a spacing of 100 mm in the shear spans, while most of the HSFRC beams were built without stirrups. The results indicate that all the parameters in this study (reinforcement ratio, presence of stirrups, concrete strength, steel fibres, fibre content and fibre type) affected the static and blast response of the beams, however, the results demonstrate that steel fibres have a more remarkable effect when compared to the other parameters. The provision of fibres is found to improve the blast performance of the HSC beams by increasing shear capacity, reducing maximum and residual mid-span displacements, reducing blast fragments and increasing damage tolerance...|$|E
