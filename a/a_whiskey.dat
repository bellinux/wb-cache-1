5|$|Originally {{known as}} Fort Hamilton, Fort Whoop-Up was a centre of illegal {{activities}} {{during the late}} 19th century. It was first built in 1869 by J.J. Healy and A.B. Hamilton as <b>a</b> <b>whiskey</b> post and was destroyed by fire a year later. A second, sturdier structure later replaced the fort.|$|E
5|$|After the US Army stopped alcohol {{trading with}} the Blackfeet Nation in Montana in 1869, traders John J. Healy and Alfred B. Hamilton started <b>a</b> <b>whiskey</b> trading post at Fort Hamilton, near the future site of Lethbridge. The post's {{nickname}} became Fort Whoop-Up. The whiskey trade {{led to the}} Cypress Hills Massacre of many native Assiniboine in 1873. The North-West Mounted Police, sent to stop the trade and establish order, arrived at Fort Whoop-Up on 9 October 1874. They managed the post for the next 12 years.|$|E

5000|$|In 1997, Dean Long {{applied for}} a license {{from the state of}} Massachusetts to {{manufacture}} high proofed spirits with the hope to produce grappa and fruit brandies at a point in the future.  <b>As</b> <b>whiskey</b> can be distilled from beer, Dean Long, Randy Hudson, and Jay Harman saw a potential for <b>a</b> distillery making <b>whiskey.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When {{at least}} 51% {{of the content}} of the mash used in the {{distillation}} of <b>a</b> straight <b>whiskey</b> consisted of corn, rye, barley, or wheat, the designation can be coupled with a special name associated with the type of grain and whether the grain was malted. For example, <b>a</b> straight <b>whiskey</b> may be <b>a</b> bourbon <b>whiskey</b> (using <b>a</b> mash of corn), malt <b>whiskey</b> (using <b>a</b> mash of malted barley), rye whiskey, rye malt whiskey, or wheat whiskey. An especially prominent variation is the labeling [...] "Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey", used to indicate <b>a</b> straight <b>whiskey</b> made in Kentucky from a mash of at least 51% corn grain.|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} of Western Pennsylvania was 17,000 in 1790. Among the {{farmers in the}} region, the whiskey excise was immediately controversial, with many people on the frontier arguing that it unfairly targeted westerners. Whiskey was a popular drink, and farmers often supplemented their incomes by operating small stills. Farmers living west of the Appalachian Mountains distilled their excess grain into whiskey, which was easier and more profitable to transport over the mountains than the more cumbersome grain. <b>A</b> <b>whiskey</b> tax would make western farmers less competitive with eastern grain producers. Additionally, cash was always in short supply on the frontier, so whiskey often served as a medium of exchange. For poorer people who were paid in whiskey, the excise was essentially an income tax that wealthier easterners did not pay.|$|E

25|$|If one {{of these}} whiskey types reaches two years aging or beyond, it is {{additionally}} designated as straight, e.g., straight rye whiskey. <b>A</b> <b>whiskey</b> that fulfils all above requirements but derives from less than 51% of any one specific grain can be called simply a straight whiskey without naming a grain.|$|E

500|$|Following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, a U.S. Army officer named Zebulon Pike {{negotiated}} approximately [...] of {{land from}} the local Dakota tribes in 1805 {{in order to establish}} a fort. The negotiated territory was located on both banks of the Mississippi River, starting from Saint Anthony Falls in present-day Minneapolis, to its confluence with the Saint Croix River. Fort Snelling was built on the territory in 1819 at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers, which formed a natural barrier to both Native American nations. The 1837 Treaty with the Sioux ceded all local tribal land east of the Mississippi to the U.S. Government. Taoyateduta (Chief Little Crow V) moved his band at Kaposia across the river to the south. Fur traders, explorers, and missionaries came to the area for the fort's protection. Many of the settlers were French-Canadians who lived nearby. However, as <b>a</b> <b>whiskey</b> trade flourished, military officers banned settlers from the fort-controlled lands. Pierre [...] "Pig's Eye" [...] Parrant, a retired fur trader-turned-bootlegger who particularly irritated officials, set up his tavern, the Pig's Eye, near present-day Lambert's Landing. By the early 1840s, the community had become important as a trading center and a destination for settlers heading west. Locals called the area Pig's Eye (French: L'Œil du Cochon) or Pig's Eye Landing after Parrant's popular tavern.|$|E
500|$|Thomas {{included}} Piz dancing humorously at {{the fraternity}} party because he [...] "could watch {{it over and}} over", and there were roughly fifteen minutes of footage of him dancing. The band that plays at the party, the Diamond Smugglers, is from Thomas's hometown of Austin, Texas, and they played at Thomas's wedding and 40th birthday party. The scene near the end with Logan smashing a police car to get intentionally thrown in prison confused the crew, who doubted its artistic and technical plausibility. However, Thomas {{was pleased with the}} final output, and producer Dan Etheridge called it [...] "one of the most compact and interesting visual storytelling pieces in the episode." [...] The episode went over budget. In this episode, Mac wears a shirt that says [...] "Ask Me About My STD", something which several critics commended for its comedic value. Thomas {{came up with the idea}} for the shirt and hired one of the other guest actors in the scene for another episode, commenting [...] "It's funny, I actually made that up, and I now have one, too." [...] In addition, because Thomas was so pleased with the acting in the scene from the boy who hands Mac <b>a</b> <b>whiskey,</b> he hired the actor for a role in a subsequent episode as an important witness to Dean O'Dell's death.|$|E
