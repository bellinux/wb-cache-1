5|$|A {{criticism}} of New Age often made by leftists {{is that its}} focus on individualism deflects participants from engaging in socio-political activism. This perspective regards New <b>Age</b> <b>as</b> a manifestation of consumerism which promotes elitism and indulgence by allowing wealthier people to affirm their socio-economic status through consuming New Age products and therapies.|$|E
5|$|A woman's {{fertility}} is {{also affected}} by her <b>age.</b> <b>As</b> a woman's total egg supply is formed in fetal life, to be ovulated decades later, {{it has been}} suggested that this long lifetime may make the chromatin of eggs more vulnerable to division problems, breakage, and mutation than the chromatin of sperm, which are produced continuously during a man's reproductive life. However, despite this hypothesis, a similar paternal age effect has also been observed.|$|E
50|$|In {{the field}} of {{sociology}} and mental health, ageing is seen in five different views: <b>ageing</b> <b>as</b> maturity, <b>ageing</b> <b>as</b> decline, <b>ageing</b> <b>as</b> a life-cycle event, <b>ageing</b> <b>as</b> generation, and <b>ageing</b> <b>as</b> survival. Positive correlates with ageing often include economics, employment, marriage, children, education, and sense of control, {{as well as many}} others. The social science of ageing includes disengagement theory, activity theory, selectivity theory, and continuity theory. Retirement, a common transition faced by the elderly, may have both positive and negative consequences. As cyborgs currently are on the rise some theorists argue {{there is a need to}} develop new definitions of ageing and for instance a bio-techno-social definition of ageing has been suggested.|$|R
40|$|Aging is {{a complex}} {{continuous}} multifactorial process leading to loss of function and crystalizing into the many age-related diseases. Here, we explore the arguments for classifying <b>aging</b> <b>as</b> a disease {{in the context of}} the upcoming World Health Organization’s 11 th International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD- 11), expected to be finalized in 2018. We hypothesize that classifying <b>aging</b> <b>as</b> a disease will result in new approaches and business models for addressing <b>aging</b> <b>as</b> a treatable condition, which will lead to both economic and healthcare benefits for all stakeholders. Classification of <b>aging</b> <b>as</b> a disease may lead to more efficient allocation of resources by enabling funding bodies and other stakeholders to use quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and healthy-years equivalent (HYE) as metrics when evaluating both research and clinical programs. We propose forming a Task Force to interface the WHO in order to develop a multidisciplinary framework for classifying <b>aging</b> <b>as</b> a disease...|$|R

In {{the summer of}} 1957 he was offered a new contract, but instead retired from the {{professional}} game aged 37, citing loss of pace due to <b>age</b> <b>as</b> the deciding factor. His final appearance for the club came on 22 April 1957 against Everton. In total he made 293 appearances for Manchester City, scoring 9 goals.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's {{work was}} {{influential}} throughout the Middle East during the Islamic Golden <b>Age,</b> <b>as</b> {{well as in}} Europe during the Renaissance. Later poets and aestheticians often distinguished poetry from, and defined it in opposition to prose, which was generally understood as writing with a proclivity to logical explication and a linear narrative structure.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the Viking Age, {{personal}} names {{containing the}} theonym Thórr are recorded with great frequency. Prior to the Viking Age, no examples are recorded.

5|$|Few fossils {{have been}} found in the Ringbone Formation, the only {{significant}} one being a specimen that is either Albertosaurus sp. or Daspletosaurus sp., known from a tooth and vertebrae. The only reason the Ringbone Formation is assigned to the Kirtlandian age is because the rocks are the same <b>age</b> <b>as</b> the Fort Crittenden Formation, which contains one of the index taxa of the Kirtlandian.|$|E

During this period, Poe claimed that its circulation increased from 700 to 3,500. He published several poems, book reviews, critiques, and stories in the paper. On May 16, 1836, he and Virginia Clemm held a Presbyterian wedding ceremony at their Richmond boarding house, with a witness falsely attesting Clemm's <b>age</b> <b>as</b> 21.|$|E

He said that his greatest motivation was the desire to impress his parents.|$|E
5|$|Michael and Olga {{frequently}} went on {{hikes in}} the forests around Gatchina with their father, who {{took the opportunity to}} teach them woodsmanship. Physical activities such as equestrianism were also taught at an early <b>age,</b> <b>as</b> was religious observance. Though Christmas and Easter were times of celebration and extravagance, Lent was strictly observed—meat, dairy products and any form of entertainment were avoided. Family holidays were taken in the summer at Peterhof Palace and with Michael's grandparents in Denmark.|$|E

5|$|Observations, {{including}} the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), and Planck {{maps of the}} CMB, suggest that the Universe is infinite in extent with a finite <b>age,</b> <b>as</b> described by the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) models.

The American Journal of Science devoted six paragraphs to Cope's passing, and incorrectly gave his <b>age</b> <b>as</b> 46. Cope was survived by his rival Marsh, who was suffering poor health.|$|E

Hopley used corporal punishment with the stated intention of overcoming what he perceived as stubbornness on Cancellor's part, but instead beat the boy to death.|$|E
