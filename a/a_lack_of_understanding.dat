5|$|Aiyer sent Ramanujan, {{with letters}} of introduction, to his {{mathematician}} friends in Madras. Some {{of them looked}} at his work and gave him letters of introduction to R. Ramachandra Rao, the district collector for Nellore {{and the secretary of}} the Indian Mathematical Society. Rao was impressed by Ramanujan's research but doubted that it was his own work. Ramanujan mentioned a correspondence he had with Professor Saldhana, a notable Bombay mathematician, in which Saldhana expressed <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> of his work but concluded that he was not a phony. Ramanujan's friend C. V. Rajagopalachari tried to quell Rao's doubts about Ramanujan's academic integrity. Rao agreed to give him another chance, and listened as Ramanujan discussed elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, and his theory of divergent series, which Rao said ultimately converted him to a belief in Ramanujan's brilliance. When Rao asked him what he wanted, Ramanujan replied that he needed work and financial support. Rao consented and sent him to Madras. He continued his research, with Rao's financial aid taking care of his daily needs. With Aiyer's help, Ramanujan had his work published in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.|$|E
5|$|In later years, {{numerous}} {{proposals were}} put forward to salvage Titanic. However, all fell afoul of practical and technological difficulties, {{a lack of}} funding and, in many cases, <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> of the physical conditions at the wreck site. Charles Smith, an architect from Denver, proposed in March 1914 to attach electromagnets to a submarine which would be irresistibly drawn to the wreck's steel hull. Having found its exact position, more electromagnets would be sent down from a fleet of barges which would winch Titanic to the surface. An estimated cost of $1.5 million (£ today) and its impracticality meant that the idea was not put into practice. Another proposal involved raising Titanic by means of attaching balloons to her hull using electromagnets. Once enough balloons had been attached, the ship would float gently to the surface. Again, the idea got {{no further than the}} drawing board.|$|E
25|$|Bashir's {{integration}} of foreign elements of style led to <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> and {{criticism of the}} traditionalists. As reported by the music journalist Sami Asmar, Bashir was accused of chumming up to his western audience by preferentially making music in extra simple maqamat. It was explicitly stated that Bashir abuses the maqamat Rast and Shadd Araban that way.|$|E

25|$|Narcissistic {{personality}} disorder (NPD) is a {{personality disorder}} {{in which there}} is a long-term pattern of abnormal behavior characterized by exaggerated feelings of self-importance, an excessive need for admiration, and <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> of others' feelings. People affected by it often spend a lot of time thinking about achieving power or success, or about their appearance. They often take advantage of the people around them. The behavior typically begins by early adulthood, and occurs across a variety of situations.|$|E
25|$|The Thai {{response}} to the insurgency has been hampered by clumsy methods, a lack of training in counter-insurgency, <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> of local culture, and rivalries between {{the police and the}} army. Many local policemen are allegedly involved in the local drug trade and other criminal activities, and army commanders from Bangkok treat them with disdain. Often the army responds to the attacks with heavy-handed raids to search Muslim villages, which only results in reprisals. Insurgents routinely provoke the inexperienced Thai government into disproportionate responses, generating sympathy among the Muslim populace.|$|E

The holding of medication in the mouth instead of swallowing it occurs mostly in children, those under psychiatric care, or simply because of <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding.</b> Holding an aspirin tablet next to a painful tooth {{in an attempt to}} relieve pulpitis (toothache) is common, and leads to epithelial necrosis. Chewable aspirin tablets should be swallowed, with the residue quickly cleared from the mouth.|$|E

25|$|These {{statistics}} {{point to}} the complexities surrounding the lack of health/nutrition literacy and reveal {{the degree to which}} they are embedded in the social structure and interconnected with other problems. Among these problems are the lack of information about food choices, <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> of nutritional information and its application to individual circumstances, limited or difficult access to healthful foods, and a range of cultural influences and socioeconomic constraints such as low levels of education and high levels of poverty that decrease opportunities for healthful eating and living.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, if {{reasonable}} doubt exists {{that the death}} {{may not have been}} suicide or that the deceased might have changed her mind and repented at the last moment (e.g., if it is unknown whether the victim fell or jumped from a building, or if the person falling changed her mind mid-fall), {{the benefit of the doubt}} is given and regular burial and mourning rituals take place. Lastly, the suicide of a minor is considered a result of <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> ("da'at"), and in such a case, regular mourning is observed.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{deficiencies}} {{may include}} problems identifying, processing, describing, {{and working with}} one's own feelings, often marked by <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> of the feelings of others; difficulty distinguishing between feelings and the bodily sensations of emotional arousal; confusion of physical sensations often associated with emotions; few dreams or fantasies due to restricted imagination; and concrete, realistic, logical thinking, often {{to the exclusion of}} emotional responses to problems. Those who have alexithymia also report very logical and realistic dreams, such as going to the store or eating a meal. Clinical experience suggests it is the structural features of dreams more than the ability to recall them that best characterizes alexithymia.|$|E

25|$|The {{materials}} {{used to construct}} the church are of importance {{in the history of}} construction in Puerto Rico. Reinforced concrete, the principal material, was seldom, if at all, used at this early date in Puerto Rico. Contemporary concrete buildings exhibited <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> of the then-new material, evidenced by extremely thick walls and excessive use of iron beams (traditional means of construction were applied to modern materials). These characteristics are not found in the construction of this building. Nechodoma used the concrete in an elegant and even decorative fashion, demonstrating his knowledge of North-American construction techniques and his distance from the local building customs. The building looks as if it is made of stone and not concrete.|$|E
25|$|Both times Bart {{improved}} {{a higher}} percentage of articles than Lisa, but the actual number of articles each edited (the bottom number of their ratios, also known as the sample size) were not the same for both of them either week. When the totals for the two weeks are added together, Bart and Lisa's work can be judged from an equal sample size; i.e., the total number of articles edited by each. Looked at in this more accurate manner, Lisa's ratio is higher and, therefore, so is her percentage. Also when the two tests are combined using a weighted average, overall, Lisa has improved a much higher percentage than Bart because the quality modifier had a significantly higher percentage. Therefore, like other paradoxes, it only appears to be a paradox because of incorrect assumptions, incomplete or misguided information, or <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> a particular concept.|$|E
25|$|Members of the Orthoreovirus genus {{have been}} known to cause {{apoptosis}} in host cells, and have thus been studied fairly extensively for this very purpose. Mammalian orthoreoviruses induce apoptosis via the activation of several death receptors—TNFR, TRAIL, and Fas—while avian orthoreovirus has been found to use the up-regulation of p53 to induce apoptosis. Both of these strains have also been found to be involved in G2/M cell cycle arrest. The avian orthoreovirus has also been proven to promote autophagy of the host which could contribute to disease in a similar manner as apoptosis. The inhibition of the innate immune response has also been seen in mammalian and avian orthoreoviruses. Other strains of the orthoreoviruses have not been studied as frequently as mammalian and avian strains resulting in <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> in the pathophysiology of those strains, though it can be assumed they act in similar ways.|$|E

25|$|The peace {{negotiations}} between the Chinese and Japanese ended unsuccessfully, due to <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> {{between the two sides}} and misrepresentation of the Koreans. The Japanese again invaded Korea in 1597; but this time all three nations were ready for war, and the Japanese were not able to advance as easily as in 1592. The Japanese tried to take Hanyang from both land and sea routes. At first the plan seemed to work well when Todo Takatora defeated Admiral Won Gyun at the Battle of Chilchonryang, but the plan was abandoned when the Korean navy under Admiral Yi Sun-sin defeated the Japanese fleet under Todo Takatora in the Battle of Myeongnyang with only 13 ships. The battle effectively ended the war, and in 1598 the Japanese at last withdrew from Korea after the sudden death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The Battle of Noryang marked the end of the war, with the last Japanese units under Konishi Yukinaga leaving Korea.|$|E
25|$|Bereft {{of further}} combat {{replacements}} for his hard-pressed Marauder battalions, Stilwell {{felt he had}} no choice but to continue offensive operations with his existing forces, using the Marauders as 'the point of the spear' until they had either achieved all their objectives, or were wiped out. He was also concerned that pulling out the Marauders, the only U.S. ground unit in the campaign, resulted in charges of favoritism, forcing him to evacuate the exhausted Chinese and British Chindit forces as well. When General William Slim, commander of British and Commonwealth forces in Burma, informed Stilwell that his men were exhausted and should be withdrawn, Stilwell rejected the idea, insisting that his subordinate commanders simply did not understand enlisted men and their tendency to magnify physical challenges. Having made his own 'long march' out of Burma under his own power using jungle trails, Stilwell found it difficult to sympathize with those who had been in combat in the jungle for months on end without relief. In retrospect, his statements at the time revealed <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> of the limitations of lightly equipped unconventional forces when used in conventional roles. Myitkyina and the dispute over evacuation policy precipitated a hurried Army Inspector General investigation, followed by U.S. congressional committee hearings, though no disciplinary measures were taken against General Stilwell for his decisions as overall commander.|$|E

500|$|An {{article in}} the American Criminal Law Review, {{published}} in 2011 by Stacey Kime, disagreed with some of Hewett's arguments. Kime argued that [...] "it is well settled that criminal defendants have {{a constitutional right to}} present exculpatory evidence", disagreeing with the idea that the basis for a robust defense had been gutted. Instead, she blamed the [...] "incoherent" [...] standard today on <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> of where the [...] "source of this constitutional right" [...] to have a strong defense lies. Unlike Hewett, who targeted post-Washington decisions, Kime believed that there were flaws in the Washington opinion itself.

500|$|Critic Anne Rubenstein {{found the}} jumps {{in time and}} {{physical}} similarity of many characters—many related to each other—to be particularly hard to keep track of, especially compared to Love and Rockets X, whose chronology was straightforward and whose characters were much easier to tell apart visually. [...] The tight plot, she says, was particularly demanding for readers, as careless reading early on could easily result in <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> later. [...] Teachers such as Derek Parker Royal have commented that their students are often confused by, or resistant to, the complexity of Poison River.

Ferguson describes Smith as [...] "candid" [...] in admitting that he did not foresee the events at Srebenica in the summer of 1995, but Smith suggests that, even had the genocide been foreseen, UNPROFOR was not in any position to prevent it. He described the force as [...] "reinforced camps of international troops attempting to defend the delivery of humanitarian aid, and often themselves". Smith's belief was that none of the governments that contributed soldiers to UNPROFOR had any intention of committing them to fight—that they had decided [...] "to deploy forces with no intention to employ their force", having been scared into inaction by inaccurate reporting and <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> of the war.|$|E
