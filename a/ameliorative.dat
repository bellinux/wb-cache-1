25|$|The Communist Party {{has sought}} to {{play an active role}} in the U.S. labor {{movement}} since its origins as part of its effort to build a mass movement of American workers to bring about their own liberation through socialist revolution. As the prospects for such a social cataclysm have faded over time, the party has increasingly emphasized the <b>ameliorative</b> value of trade unions in capitalist society.|$|E
25|$|A red-light {{perspective}} of administrative law embodies deep-rooted suspicion of governmental {{power and a}} desire to minimize the encroachment of the state on the rights of individuals. This envisions the courts being locked in an adversarial or combative relationship with the Executive and functioning as a check on administrative power. Where a green-light perspective is concerned, the focus is not so much on actively resisting administrative bodies as a form of negative control (as in the red-light perspective), but instead raising areas where public bodies may improve their various administrative procedures. This approach is derived from the utilitarian tradition, and the priority in achieving the greatest good for the greatest number is to encourage the contribution of the state through means of egalitarian and <b>ameliorative</b> social reform so as to deliver communitarian goals. Thus, the red-light perspective is more conservative and control-oriented, while the green-light perspective is more liberal or socialist in orientation and facilitative in nature.|$|E

Russell insists that the beginning of all <b>ameliorative</b> reforms to government must presuppose democracy as a rule.

2500|$|The primary {{pharmacological}} {{treatments for}} ADHD are methylphenidate (Ritalin) and amphetamine. Both methylphenidate and amphetamines block re-uptake of dopamine and norepinephrine into the pre-synaptic neuron, acting to increase post-synaptic levels of dopamine and norepinephrine. Of these two monoamines, increased availability of dopamine {{is considered the}} primary cause for the <b>ameliorative</b> effects of ADHD medications, whereas increased levels of norepinephrine may be efficacious {{only to the extent}} that it has downstream, indirect effects on dopamine.|$|E
2500|$|Now {{outside of}} the {{national}} Socialist Party, the bolting left wing of the Socialist Party of Washington faced the important {{question of how to}} proceed. Consideration was made to join the rival Socialist Labor Party, which shared the disdain of the [...] "Reds" [...] for the <b>ameliorative</b> reform and broad political alliance touted by the moderates. Ultimately, however, the domination of the SLP by the personality of Daniel DeLeon and the organization's insistence on establishing dual unions weighed against it.|$|E

The gathering featured a heated debated between the radical and moderate wings of the SPW, with the left wing garnering a majority. The convention used a proxy voting system; every member of the SPW was entitled to attend, and delegates could collect mandates from non-attending members and vote in their stead. A total of 244 [...] "votes" [...] were present at the convention, based upon this system. The proxy voting system was eliminated the subsequent year, in favor of required attendance for participation and a limit of one vote to be cast per delegate. the convention adopted a state platform, which again did not include any proposals for <b>ameliorative</b> reform.|$|E
2500|$|On September 25, 2008, President George W. Bush {{signed the}} ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA) into law. The {{amendment}} broadened {{the definition of}} [...] "disability", thereby extending the ADA's protections to {{a greater number of}} people. The ADAAA also added to the ADA examples of [...] "major life activities" [...] including, but not limited to, [...] "caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working" [...] as well as the operation of several specified major bodily functions. The act overturned a 1999 US Supreme Court case that held that an employee was not disabled if the impairment could be corrected by mitigating measures; it specifically provides that such impairment must be determined without considering such <b>ameliorative</b> measures. It also overturned the court restriction that an impairment which substantially limits one major life activity must also limit others to be considered a disability.|$|E
2500|$|Waldman {{was elected}} {{chairman}} of the Socialist Party of New York state in 1928, a position which he retained through {{the first half of}} the 1930s. He also stood as the SP candidate for Governor of New York in 1928, 1930 and 1932, polling over 100,000 votes in each of these races. Along with Morris Hillquit, James Oneal, and Algernon Lee, Waldman was recognized as a leader of the SP's [...] "Old Guard" [...] faction, which favored close working relations with the trade unions of the American Federation of Labor and pursuance of gradual <b>ameliorative</b> reforms leading eventually to socialism rather than cataclysmic revolutionary transformation. This perspective brought Waldman and the Old Guard into opposition of the largely youth based [...] "Militant" [...] faction in the party, who favored reconciliation with the Communist Party USA, in keeping with the United Front policy of the Comintern and preparation for a socialist struggle for power in the event of capitalism's collapse.|$|E

And in that year, running short on sleep and tasking my brain to its limit, I neither drank nor cared to drink. So far as I was concerned, alcohol did not exist. I did suffer from brain-fag on occasion, but alcohol never suggested itself as an <b>ameliorative.</b> Heavens! Editorial acceptances and cheques were all the amelioratives I needed. A thin envelope from an editor in the morning's mail was more stimulating than half a dozen cocktails.
