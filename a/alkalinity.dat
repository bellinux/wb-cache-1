5|$|Kettle Creek is a {{freestone}} stream, {{meaning that}} there is little limestone and <b>alkalinity</b> in it.|$|E
5|$|The tributaries of Catawissa Creek have pHs {{ranging from}} 4.4 to 7.4. Their {{concentrations}} of <b>alkalinity</b> range from 0 to 42 milligrams per liter, with the significant majority having <b>alkalinity</b> concentrations under 20 milligrams per liter. The tributaries' concentrations of water hardness range from 0 {{to more than}} 150 milligrams per liter.|$|E
5|$|At Catawissa Creek's headwaters, the {{concentration}} of iron in the water is 0.34mg/L. Manganese's level of occurrence is 1.74mg/L. Aluminium's concentration is 3.2mg/L. Acidity makes up 34.5mg/L and <b>alkalinity</b> makes up 0.17mg/L.|$|E
5|$|At the USGS {{gauging station}} on Kettle Creek, the {{concentration}} of iron is 0.15 milligrams per liter, {{the concentration of}} manganese is 0.04 milligrams per liter, and the concentration of aluminum is 0.14 milligrams per liter. The acidity concentration is 0.64 milligrams per liter and the concentration of <b>alkalinity</b> is 11.36 milligrams per liter. At the mouth of Twomile Run, the concentration of iron is 5.09 milligrams per liter, the concentration of manganese is 6.44 milligrams per liter, and the aluminum concentration is 8.57 milligrams per liter. The concentration of acidity is 90.5 milligrams per liter {{and there is no}} <b>alkalinity.</b>|$|E
5|$|The iron, manganese, and {{aluminum}} concentrations {{at the mouth}} of Butler Hollow are 1.68, 16.9, and 15.05 milligrams per liter, respectively. The concentration of acidity is 121.28 milligrams per liter and the <b>alkalinity</b> concentration is 0. At the mouth of Kettle Creek, the iron concentration is 0.15 milligrams per liter and the manganese concentration is 0.07 milligrams per liter. Aluminum occurs in concentrations of 0.15 milligrams per liter {{at the mouth of}} the creek. The concentration of acidity and <b>alkalinity</b> are 1.65 and 11.17 milligrams per liter, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The lake has {{relatively}} {{high levels of}} dissolved salts, total <b>alkalinity,</b> and conductivity. The average pH has generally ranged between 7 and 8.|$|E
5|$|The pH of Messers Run {{between the}} Lofty Reservoir and the Blue Head Reservoir is 6.6. The {{concentration}} of <b>alkalinity</b> in {{this portion of}} the stream is 4 milligrams per liter and the total water hardness is 18 milligrams per liter. The pH of the stream below the Blue Head Reservoir is 6.6. The concentration of <b>alkalinity</b> {{in this part of the}} stream is 5 milligrams per liter and the water hardness is 13 milligrams per liter.|$|E
5|$|The pH of Messers Run {{upstream}} of the Lofty Reservoir is 6.3. The total {{concentration of}} <b>alkalinity</b> {{in this part}} of the stream is 3 milligrams per liter. These values are similar to those measured in a similar area during a 1990 survey of the stream. The concentration of water hardness {{in this part of}} the stream is 47 milligrams per liter. A 1997 report noted that this value was very high considering the concentration of <b>alkalinity.</b>|$|E
5|$|In June 1999, the pH of Nanticoke Creek {{downstream}} of the Truesdale Mine Discharge was 6.8 and in October 1999, it was 6.4. At the creek's mouth, the pH was 6.8 in October 1999. The net <b>alkalinity</b> concentration was 40.0 {{milligrams per}} liter at the mine discharge in June, 3.70 milligrams per liter at the discharge in October, and 18.0 milligrams per liter {{at the mouth}} in October. During the 1970s, the acidity concentration of the creek's waters ranged from 18 to 365 parts per million on the main stem. The <b>alkalinity</b> concentration ranged from 0 to 3 parts per million. The specific conductance of the creek below the mine discharge was 1380 micro-siemens per centimeter in June 1999 and 1430 micro-siemens per centimeter in October. The specific conductance at the creek's mouth was 1390 micro-siemens per centimeter in October.|$|E
5|$|Spring Brook {{experiences}} noticeable flow loss. As of 2009, it {{has high}} levels of sodium and <b>alkalinity.</b> Pittson Township and the borough of Moosic have permits to discharge stormwater into it. However, the water quality and habitat quality of the stream are relatively unimpacted. The stream has relatively high water quality even where it flows through a concrete channel. In {{a study by the}} Susquehanna River Basin Commission, it was found not to fail any water quality standards either during base flow or storm flow conditions. However, a study from the previous year found concentrations of sodium and <b>alkalinity</b> exceeding the threshold for concern. In the early 1900s, Spring Brook was a clear stream in its upper reaches. However, by the time it reached the property of the Du Pont Powder Company, it was affected by slush pumped into it by the Pennsylvania Coal Company.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentration}} of <b>alkalinity</b> in Roaring Creek upstream of Lick Run is 9 milligrams per liter. Many nearby watersheds have been rendered nearly devoid of aquatic life due to acid mine drainage caused by coal mining. However, Roaring Creek {{has not been}} affected by this, {{although it has been}} still impacted by human land use. Sedimentation, siltation, and agricultural impacts occur in the watershed. The only impaired stream in the watershed is a small unnamed tributary that is impaired by siltation. From a chemical standpoint, Roaring Creek is infertile.|$|E
5|$|At river mile 5.1, the pH of {{the waters}} of Scotch Run is 6.6 and at river mile 1.3, the pH is 7.0. At the stream's mouth, the pH is 6.8. The {{concentration}} of <b>alkalinity</b> in the stream is 5 milligrams per liter at river mile 5.1 and 8 milligrams per liter at river mile 1.3 and at the mouth. At river mile 5.1, the level of water hardness in the stream is 23 milligrams per liter, while at river mile 1.3, the water hardness is 15 milligrams per liter. It is 18 milligrams per liter at the stream's mouth.|$|E
5|$|On {{the western}} side of the lower reaches of the Kettle Creek watershed, there is an {{underground}} mine complex with 26 sources of acid mine drainage. The acid mine drainage enters Kettle Creek, among other streams in the area and the sources of it have an average discharge of 479 gallons per minute. They also have 304 milligrams per liter of acidity, 44 milligrams per liter of iron, 21 milligrams per liter of aluminum, 8 milligrams per liter of manganese, and 930 milligrams per liter of sulfates. The <b>alkalinity</b> load from the Alvin R. Bush Dam is about 15 times greater than the acidity load from these acid mine discharges.|$|E
5|$|Many households, {{and some}} small communities, rely on {{rainwater}} for their drinking water supplies. Roof-fed systems are highly vulnerable to contamination by ashfall, {{as they have}} a large surface area relative to the storage tank volume. In these cases, leaching of chemical contaminants from the ashfall can become a health risk and drinking of water is not recommended. Prior to an ashfall, downpipes should be disconnected so that water in the tank is protected. A further {{problem is that the}} surface coating of fresh volcanic ash can be acidic. Unlike most surface waters, rainwater generally has a very low <b>alkalinity</b> (acid-neutralising capacity) and thus ashfall may acidify tank waters. This may lead to problems with plumbosolvency, whereby the water is more aggressive towards materials that it comes into contact with. This can be a particular problem if there are lead-head nails or lead flashing used on the roof, and for copper pipes and other metallic plumbing fittings.|$|E
5|$|The {{discharge}} of Kettle Creek at the USGS gauge at Westport ranged from 4 to 6280 {{cubic feet per}} second between 1970 and 2006. The median discharge was 208 cubic feet per second and the mean was 396 cubic feet per second. The pH of the creek at this point was measured in 1980 and 1983 to by 6.4. The tributaries Twomile Run, Huling Branch, and Middle Branch above the acid mine drainage have had their pH levels measured at 5.9, 5.7, and 5.5, respectively. The pH of the watershed ranges from 5.5 to 8.6. The <b>alkalinity</b> concentration of {{the waters of the}} creek ranged from 20 to 25 milligrams per liter in the 1950s and 1960s, but decreased to 11 to 15 milligrams per liter by 1993. Kettle Creek's level of specific conductivity ranges from 50 to 1500 micro-siemens.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} conductance of Roraing Creek ranges from 11 micro-siemens per centimeter at site 2 to 127 micro-siemens per centimeter at site 4. In 2003 and 2004, the pH {{of the creek}} ranged from 7.0 to 7.2. In a later survey, it {{was found to be}} acidic at sites 1 and 2 (6.50 and 6.89, respectively), but alkaline at sites 3 and 4 (7.34 and 8.27, respectively). The concentration of <b>alkalinity</b> in the creek ranges from 5.1 milligrams per liter at site 1 to 32 milligrams per liter at site 2. The concentration of water hardness ranges from 28 milligrams per liter at river mile 4.04 to 44 milligrams per liter at river mile 8.54. The discharge of the creek is 12.2 liters per second at site 1, 243.5 liters per second at site 2, 216.7 liters per second at site 3, and 271.6 liters per second at site 4.|$|E
5|$|The lake {{does not}} meet the National Water Quality Standards due to its high {{concentration}} of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). Considering the adverse impact on the lake water quality due to Eutrophication, anthropogenic pressures and holy rituals and tourism, a water quality study was specifically undertaken at four sites on a monthly basis for six months. The sampling sites were chosen to represent the pressure of pilgrims and other pollution inflows at the locations. The water samples were analysed for temperature, pH, salinity, conductivity, total dissolved solids, <b>alkalinity,</b> hardness, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, sodium, ammonium, potassium, total chlorophyll, biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. The analysis over the period has revealed that the lake water was alkaline, chloride and conductivity concentrations were high at all the four sites, and there were lower levels of dissolved oxygen (at sites with greater pollution load) and high hardness (on account of excess of calcium and magnesium from surface run-off). During the period of the annual Pushkar Fair, a distinct co-relationship was discerned between various parameters analysed and the degree of water pollution in the lake. This has called for urgent remedial actions to be undertaken by all of the government agencies involved with the lake management, with people's participation.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} processes include soil salinity, soil acidity and soil <b>alkalinity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} can {{be administered}} to pools, spas, and garden ponds {{to raise the}} total <b>alkalinity.</b> This will also raise the pH level and make maintaining proper pH easier. In {{the event that the}} pH is low and the <b>alkalinity</b> is adequate or high, sodium bicarbonate should not be used to adjust the pH.|$|E
25|$|<b>Alkalinity</b> {{should be}} 3.24.5 meq/L. or 7 and 12 degrees of {{carbonate}} hardness (dKH).|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{hydroxide}} {{is used in}} many scenarios {{where it}} is desirable to increase the <b>alkalinity</b> of a mixture, or to neutralize acids.|$|E
25|$|A pH meter is an {{electronic}} instrument {{used to measure}} the pH (acidity or <b>alkalinity)</b> of a liquid. In 1935, Arnold Orville Beckman invented the pH meter.|$|E
25|$|The main physico-chemical {{parameters}} commonly measured {{to characterize}} fecal sludge include: BOD, total suspended solids, % solids, indication of sand, COD, ammonium, total nitrogen and total phosphorus, Fats, Oil and Grease (FOG), Sludge Volume Index (SVI), pH, <b>alkalinity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{suggested}} tests {{include those}} for calcium, carbonate <b>alkalinity,</b> magnesium, and other trace elements. It is often beneficial (and necessary) for the aquarist {{to research the}} water chemistry parameters for the specific organism that is desired.|$|E
25|$|The <b>alkalinity</b> of semen helps {{neutralize}} the acidity of the vaginal tract, prolonging the lifespan of sperm. Acidic ejaculate (pH <7.2) {{may be associated}} with ejaculatory duct obstruction. The vesicles produce semenogelin, a protein that causes semen to become sticky and jelly-like after ejaculation.|$|E
25|$|The hypersalinity {{and high}} <b>alkalinity</b> (pH=10 or {{equivalent}} to 4 milligrams of NaOH per liter of water) {{of the lake}} means that no fish are native to the lake. An attempt by the California Department of Fish and Game to stock the lake failed.|$|E
25|$|The Arrhenius {{definitions}} of acidity and <b>alkalinity</b> {{are restricted to}} aqueous solutions, and refer to the concentration of the solvent ions. Under this definition, pure H2SO4 and HCl dissolved in toluene are not acidic, and molten NaOH and solutions of calcium amide in liquid ammonia are not alkaline.|$|E
25|$|Saltwater is {{typically}} alkaline, while the pH (<b>alkalinity</b> or acidicity) {{of fresh water}} varies more. Hardness measures overall dissolved mineral content; hard or soft water may be preferred. Hard water is usually alkaline, while soft water is usually neutral to acidic. Dissolved organic content and dissolved gases content are also important factors.|$|E
25|$|For example, in the {{petroleum}} industry, sodium hydroxide {{is used as}} an additive in drilling mud to increase <b>alkalinity</b> in bentonite mud systems, to increase the mud viscosity, and to neutralize any acid gas (such as hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide) which may be encountered in the geological formation as drilling progresses.|$|E
25|$|In the oil industry, calcium {{carbonate}} {{is added to}} drilling fluids as a formation-bridging and filtercake-sealing agent; {{it is also a}} weighting material which increases the density of drilling fluids to control the downhole pressure. Calcium carbonate is added to swimming pools, as a pH corrector for maintaining <b>alkalinity</b> and offsetting the acidic properties of the disinfectant agent.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{nutritional}} {{benefits of}} nixtamalization {{arise from the}} alkaline processing involved. These conditions convert corn's bound niacin to free niacin, making it available for absorption into the body, thus preventing pellagra. <b>Alkalinity</b> also reduces {{the amount of the}} protein zein available to the body, which improves the balance among essential amino acids, although the overall amount of protein is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Because of the lake’s extreme <b>alkalinity,</b> {{there are}} no {{recreational}} activities that occur on the lake. In fact, swimming or extended contact with the lake’s water would be harmful to humans. There are no developed campgrounds at Lake Abert, but the Bureau of Land Management does allow dispersed camping in the area. The only common recreational activity at Lake Abert is bird watching.|$|E
25|$|When {{ethylene}} glycol {{is used in}} a system, it may become oxidized to five organic acids (formic, oxalic, glycolic, glyoxalic and acetic acid). Inhibited {{ethylene glycol}} antifreeze mixes are available, with additives that buffer the pH and reserve <b>alkalinity</b> of the solution to prevent oxidation of ethylene glycol and formation of these acids. Nitrites, silicates, theodin, borates and azoles may {{also be used to}} prevent corrosive attack on metal.|$|E
25|$|The {{downstream}} {{drainage water}} quality may deteriorate owing to leaching of salts, nutrients, herbicides and pesticides with high salinity and <b>alkalinity.</b> There is threat of soils converting into saline or alkali soils. This may negatively affect {{the health of}} the population at the tail-end of the river basin and downstream of the irrigation scheme, as well as the ecological balance. The Aral Sea, for example, is seriously polluted by drainage water.|$|E
25|$|Magnesium {{in natural}} {{seawater}} values are between 1250mg/L and 1350mg/L. (approximately 3.7% {{of the total}} seawater mineral content. See thumbnail chart.) Dead Sea minerals contain a significantly higher magnesium chloride ratio (50.8%). Carbonates and calcium are essential for all growth of corals, coralline algae, clams, and invertebrates. Magnesium can be depleted by mangrove plants {{and the use of}} excessive limewater or by going beyond natural calcium, <b>alkalinity,</b> and pH values.|$|E
25|$|The active {{substances}} in tobacco, especially cigarettes, are administered by {{burning the leaves}} and inhaling the vaporized gas that results. This quickly and effectively delivers substances into the bloodstream by absorption through the alveoli in the lungs. The lungs contain some 300 million alveoli, which amounts to a surface area of over 70m2 (about {{the size of a}} tennis court). This method is not completely efficient as not all of the smoke will be inhaled, and some amount of the {{active substances}} will be lost in the process of combustion, pyrolysis. Pipe and Cigar smoke are not inhaled because of its high <b>alkalinity,</b> which are irritating to the trachea and lungs. However, because of its higher <b>alkalinity</b> (pH 8.5) compared to cigarette smoke (pH 5.3), non-ionized nicotine is more readily absorbed through the mucous membranes in the mouth. Nicotine absorption from cigar and pipe, however, is much less than that from cigarette smoke. Nicotine and cocaine activate similar patterns of neurons, which supports the existence of common substrates among these drugs.|$|E
