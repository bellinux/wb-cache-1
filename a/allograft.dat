5|$|To {{achieve an}} {{adequate}} width and height of bone, various bone grafting techniques have been developed. The {{most frequently used}} is called guided bone graft augmentation where a defect is filled with either natural (harvested or autograft) bone or <b>allograft</b> (donor bone or synthetic bone substitute), covered with a semi-permeable membrane and allowed to heal. During the healing phase, natural bone replaces the graft forming a new bony base for the implant.|$|E
5|$|Serpins {{are also}} {{expressed}} by viruses {{as a way}} to evade the host's immune defense. In particular, serpins expressed by pox viruses, including cow pox (vaccinia) and rabbit pox (myxoma), are of interest because of their potential use as novel therapeutics for immune and inflammatory disorders as well as transplant therapy. Serp1 suppresses the TLR-mediated innate immune response and allows indefinite cardiac <b>allograft</b> survival in rats. Crma and Serp2 are both cross-class inhibitors and target both serine (granzyme B; albeit weakly) and cysteine proteases (caspase1 and caspase8). In comparison to their mammalian counterparts, viral serpins contain significant deletions of elements of secondary structure. Specifically, crmA lacks the D-helix as well as significant portions of the A- and E-helices.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the immunological status of small-for-size liver <b>allografts</b> and possible mechanism {{that contributes to the}} accelerated immune response in these <b>allografts.</b> Eight experimental groups were: whole isografts; 40 % isografts; whole <b>allografts,</b> no treatment; 40 % <b>allografts,</b> no treatment; whole <b>allografts</b> with sodium salicylate intraperitoneal injection, D 0 - 3; 40 % <b>allografts</b> with sodium salicylate, D 0 - 3; whole <b>allografts</b> with FK 506 intramuscular injection D 0 - 3, and 40 % <b>allografts</b> with FK 506, D 0 - 3. The 40 % <b>allografts</b> survived significantly shorter than whole <b>allografts</b> (p = 0. 02). At 72 h after reperfusion, a higher number of macrophages infiltrated into the periportal area of small-for-size <b>allografts</b> than whole <b>allografts.</b> Remarkable up-regulation of interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were detected in small-for-size <b>allografts</b> within 24 h after reperfusion. Sodium salicylate administration reduced IL- 1 β and IFN-γ mRNA in both small-for-size and whole <b>allografts,</b> but it could decrease IL- 2 and IL- 10 mRNA levels only in small-for-size <b>allografts.</b> In vitro study revealed that CD 80, CD 86 and CD 11 b expression on macrophages was augmented after IL- 1 β stimulation, whereas the up-regulation could be blocked by sodium salicylate. In conclusion, early activation of macrophages as a result of graft injury might {{play an important role in}} the accelerated acute rejection process In small-for-size <b>allografts.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|With a {{contralateral}} (opposite side) autogenous patellar tendon graft, the graft {{includes the}} middle {{section of the}} patellar tendon along with two attached bone plugs one on each end. The contralateral autogenous patellar tendon graft is rarely used as primary revision due to the concern of donor site morbidity. Instead it is primarily considered when a patient is opposed to using an <b>allograft</b> but has already undergone an ACL revision using the ipsilateral patellar tendon. In addition, there are many health care settings around the nation where readily available, safe, and cost effective <b>allograft</b> tissues are not obtainable.

25|$|An <b>allograft</b> is a {{transplant}} of an organ or tissue between two genetically non-identical {{members of the}} same species. Most human tissue and organ transplants are allografts. Due to the genetic difference between the organ and the recipient, the recipient's immune system will identify the organ as foreign and attempt to destroy it, causing transplant rejection. The risk of transplant rejection can be estimated by measuring the Panel reactive antibody level.|$|E

This can be verified by irradiating 100 <b>allografts</b> at a dose selected to provide a sterility assurance level of 10 - 2. The bioburden of our <b>allografts</b> was 0, which prescribed a verification dose of 1. 3 kGy. After irradiating 100 llografts, sterility tests returned no positive cultures. We therefore validated an RSD of 11 kGy for <b>allografts</b> with that bioburden.

40|$|Intimal {{expansion}} by vascular {{smooth muscle}} cells (SMCs) is a characteristic feature of graft vascular disease. Whether graft intimal SMCs arise from donor or recipient tissue {{is not well}} established but has important pathogenetic implications. We examined {{for the presence of}} male cells in the expanded intima of sex-mismatched mouse aortic <b>allografts</b> (C 57 BL/ 6 -to-BALB/c) at 30 or 60 days after transplant by in situ hybridization using a Y-chromosome probe. Study groups included male-to-female <b>allografts,</b> female-to-male <b>allografts,</b> and female-to-female <b>allografts</b> in recipients previously engrafted with male bone marrow. Although intimal expansion developed in all <b>allografts,</b> male-to-female <b>allografts</b> lacked Y-chromosome-positive intimal cells. In contrast, such cells were abundant in female-to-male <b>allografts</b> and most of these cells co-labeled for smooth muscle α-actin by immunostain. Female-to-female <b>allografts</b> in recipients with male bone marrow showed a limited number of intimal Y-chromosome-positive cells. However, none of these clearly co-labeled for smooth muscle α-actin and their numbers declined throughout time, consistent with graft-infiltrating inflammatory cells. We conclude that intimal expansion of mouse aortic <b>allografts</b> is mediated by SMCs that originated from the recipient. There was little evidence of their derivation from the bone marrow, suggesting instead the adjacent host aorta as the primary source of intimal SMCs...|$|R

25|$|The {{release of}} cytokines causes many functions, such as airway remodeling, a {{characteristic}} of IL-17 responses. The increased expression of chemokines attracts other cells including neutrophils but not eosinophils. IL-17 function is also essential to a subset of CD4+ T-Cells called T helper 17 (Th17) cells. As {{a result of these}} roles, the IL-17 family has been linked to many immune/autoimmune related diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus, <b>allograft</b> rejection, anti-tumour immunity and recently psoriasis and multiple sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Variations on {{the nerve}} {{autograft}} include the <b>allograft</b> and the xenograft. In allografts, the tissue for the graft {{is taken from}} another person, the donor, and implanted in the recipient. Xenografts involve taking donor tissue from another species. Allografts and xenografts have the same disadvantages as autografts, but in addition, tissue rejection from immune responses {{must also be taken}} into account. Often immunosuppression is required with these grafts. Disease transmission also becomes a factor when introducing tissue from another person or animal. Overall, allografts and xenografts do not match the quality of outcomes seen with autografts, but they are necessary when {{there is a lack of}} autologous nerve tissue.|$|E

40|$|Cortical bone grafts were {{implanted}} {{for six months}} in mature dogs using an osteoperiosteal 3 -cm defect in the ulna to evaluate their respective morphometric and physical values compared with autografts. The bone-grafting material included fresh auto- and <b>allografts,</b> frozen and thimerosal preserved <b>allografts,</b> and partially demineralized bone <b>allografts.</b> The grafts were evaluated by roentgenograms, microradiograms, photon absorptiometry, porosity, fluorescence labeling measurements, and torsional loading at failure. Autografts achieved a better union score than the <b>allografts,</b> but intracortical bone porosity, percentage of cumulative new bone, and mineral apposition rate were not variables with statistical significance. Lamellar bone was found earlier and in greater quantity in autografts. Within the graft, new bone was deposited at a slower rate than in the recipient bone. Autografts showed less peripheral resorption and a greater torsional resistance than <b>allografts.</b> Photon absorptiometry demonstrated that nondemineralized <b>allografts</b> underwent a substantial loss of peripheral bone. This marked reduction in the outer diameter of the graft had more influence on torsional resistance than did the intracortical porosity of the graft.

25|$|Canine {{transmissible}} venereal {{tumors are}} histiocytic tumors {{that may be}} transmitted among dogs through coitus, licking, biting and sniffing tumor affected areas. The concept that the tumor is naturally transmissible as an <b>allograft</b> came from three important observations. First, CTVTs can only be experimentally induced by transplanting living tumor cells, and not by killed cells or cell filtrates. Second, the tumor karyotype is aneuploid but has characteristic marker chromosomes in all tumors collected in different geographic regions. Third, a {{long interspersed nuclear element}} (LINE-1) insertion near c-myc has been found in all tumors examined so far and {{can be used as a}} diagnostic marker to confirm that a tumor is a CTVT.|$|E
25|$|Biomaterials can {{be derived}} either from nature or {{synthesized}} in the laboratory {{using a variety of}} chemical approaches utilizing metallic components, polymers, ceramics or composite materials. They are often used and/or adapted for a medical application, and thus comprises whole or part of a living structure or biomedical device which performs, augments, or replaces a natural function. Such functions may be relatively passive, like being used for a heart valve, or may be bioactive with a more interactive functionality such as hydroxy-apatite coated hip implants. Biomaterials are also used every day in dental applications, surgery, and drug delivery. For example, a construct with impregnated pharmaceutical products can be placed into the body, which permits the prolonged release of a drug {{over an extended period of}} time. A biomaterial may also be an autograft, <b>allograft</b> or xenograft used as a transplant material.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} {{transplantation}} has changed survival from {{as low as}} 15% in the pretransplant era to more than 60% today. Liver transplantation is indicated for many patients with ALF, and survival rates of 56–90% can be achieved. In addition to transplantation, better critical care and the trend toward more benign causes, such as acetaminophen, all contribute to improved survival rates. Spontaneous survival is now around 40%. The application of transplantation among patients with ALF remains low, suggesting that the full potential of this modality may not be realized. Timely availability of an <b>allograft</b> {{is one of the}} major factors determining transplant outcomes. In the largest U.S. study, only 29% of patients received a liver graft, while 10% of the overall group (one fourth of patients listed for transplantation) died on the waiting list.

25|$|Liver {{transplantation}} or hepatic transplantation is {{the replacement}} of a diseased liver with the healthy liver from another person (<b>allograft).</b> Liver transplantation is a treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure, although availability of donor organs is a major limitation. The most common technique is orthotopic transplantation, in which the native liver is removed and replaced by the donor organ in the same anatomic position as the original liver. The surgical procedure is complex, requiring careful harvest of the donor organ and meticulous implantation into the recipient. Liver transplantation is highly regulated, and only performed at designated transplant medical centers by highly trained transplant physicians and supporting medical team. The duration of the surgery ranges from 4 to 18 hours depending on outcome. Favorable outcomes require careful screening for eligible recipient, {{as well as a}} well-calibrated live or cadaveric donor match.|$|E
25|$|Many ADPKD {{patients}} suffer symptomatic sequelae {{in consequence}} of the disease, such as cyst hemorrhage, flank pain, recurrent infections, nephrolithiasis, and symptoms of mass effect (i.e., early satiety, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal discomfort), from their enlarged kidneys. In such cases, nephrectomy can be required due to intractable symptoms or when, {{in the course of}} preparing for renal transplantation, the native kidneys are found to impinge upon the true pelvis and preclude the placement of a donor <b>allograft.</b> Additionally, native nephrectomy may be undertaken in the presence of suspected malignancy, as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is 2 to 3 times more likely in the ADPKD population in end stage renal disease (ESRD) than in the ESRD patients without ADPKD. Although the indications for nephrectomy in ADPKD may be related to kidney size, the decision to proceed with native nephrectomy is often undertaken on an individual basis, without specific reference to kidney size measurements.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Gamma {{irradiation}} {{has been}} widely used for sterilization of bone <b>allografts.</b> However, gamma irradiation alters proteins. This is favorable when it reduces immunogenicity, but is undesirable when osteoinductive proteins are damaged. Although the effect of gamma irradiation on BMPs has been studied, the effect of irradiation {{on the process of}} incorporation of morselized bone chips remains unclear. We studied the effects of sterilization by gamma irradiation on the incorporation of impacted morselized <b>allografts.</b> METHODS: Bone chambers with impacted <b>allografts,</b> rinsed impacted <b>allografts,</b> <b>allografts</b> that were rinsed and subsequently irradiated, and an empty control were implanted in proximal medial tibiae of goats. Incorporation was evaluated using histology and histomorphometry. RESULTS: Histology revealed evidence of bone graft incorporation, which proceeded in a similar way in unprocessed, rinsed, and both rinsed and irradiated bone grafts. After 12 weeks, no difference in bone and tissue ingrowth was found between the unprocessed, the rinsed, and the rinsed and subsequently irradiated <b>allografts.</b> The amount of unresorbed graft remnant was highest in the unprocessed bone grafts. INTERPRETATION: We conclude that sterilization with gamma irradiation does not influence the incorporation of impacted rinsed bone <b>allografts...</b>|$|R
40|$|AIM: Allocation of deceased-donor kidneys in Australia often {{involves}} the shipping of well-matched renal <b>allografts</b> across states.

In this study, the effect of shipping of well-matched (0 - 2 human leucocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches) and poorer-matched (3 - 6 HLA mismatches) deceased-donor kidneys on transplant outcomes in Australia were examined. METHODS: Using data from Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA), graft and patient outcomes were compared between shipped and locally transplanted <b>allografts</b> in Australia between 1992 and 2007 stratified {{by the number of}} HLA mismatches. RESULTS: Recipients receiving shipped renal <b>allografts</b> {{were more likely to be}} highly sensitized with previous grafts and/or higher panel reactive antibodies levels with significantly longer graft ischaemic time compared to local <b>allografts.</b> Regardless of the HLA mismatches, the risk of delayed graft function, acute rejection, 12 month serum creatinine, graft failure and patient survival was similar between shipped and locally transplanted renal <b>allografts.</b> CONCLUSION: Recipients of shipped renal <b>allografts</b> with 0 - 2 and 3 - 6 HLA mismatches have similar transplant outcomes to locally transplanted <b>allografts.</b> Wai H Lim, Graeme R Russ and Stephen P Mcdonal...|$|R
