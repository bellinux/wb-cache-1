Wyoming remained in service briefly after the war, though she was decommissioned in August 1947. She was sold for scrap in October and subsequently broken up. Arkansas was instead retained for use as a target ship during the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in mid-1946. She survived the first test, an <b>air-burst</b> code-named ABLE, though the second experiment, an underwater detonation code-named BAKER, sank the ship.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{comparison}} to underline this is found when one compares the 50 megaton <b>air-burst</b> Tsar Bomba, which produced no concentrated local/early fallout, and thus no known deaths from radiation, with the surface burst of the 15 megaton Castle Bravo, which in comparison, {{due to the}} local fallout produced, was implicated {{in the death of}} 1 of 23 crew on the Lucky Dragon and made the entire Bikini Atoll unfit for further nuclear testing until enough time elapsed and the intensity of the radiation field had decayed to acceptable levels.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, {{regardless}} of if {{a nuclear attack}} on a city is of the surface or <b>air-burst</b> variety or a mixture of both, the advice to shelter in place, {{in the interior of}} well-built homes, or if available, fallout shelters, as suggested in the film Duck and Cover, will drastically reduce one's chance of absorbing a hazardous dose of radiation. A real-world example of this occurred after the Castle Bravo test where, in contrast to the crew of the Lucky Dragon, the firing crew that triggered the explosion safely sheltered in their firing station until after a number of hours had passed and the radiation levels outside fell to dose rate levels safe enough for an evacuation to be considered. The comparative safety experienced by the Castle Bravo firing crew served as a proof of concept to civil defense personnel that Shelter in place (or [...] "buttoning up" [...] as it was known then) is an effective strategy in mitigating the potentially serious health effects of local fallout.|$|E

2500|$|In the era {{the advice}} was {{originally}} given, {{the most common}} nuclear weapons were weapons comparable to the US Fat Man and Soviet Joe-1 in yield. The most far-reaching dangers that initially come from the nuclear explosion of this, and higher, yield weapons as airbursts, are the initial flash/heat and blast effects and not from fallout. This {{is due to the}} fact that when nuclear weapons are detonated to maximize the range of building destruction, that is, maximize the range of surface blast damage, an airburst is the preferred nuclear fuzing height, as it exploits the mach stem phenomenon. This phenomenon of a blast wave occurs when the blast reaches the ground and is reflected. Below a certain reflection angle the reflected wave and the incident wave merge and form a reinforced horizontal wave, this is known as the 'Mach stem' (named after Ernst Mach) and is a form of constructive interference and consequently extends the range of high pressure. While <b>Air-burst</b> fuzing also increases the range that peoples skin will have a line-of-sight with the nuclear fireball. However, as a result of the high altitude of the explosion, most of the radioactive bomb debris/ is dispersed into the stratosphere, with a great column of air therefore placed between the vast majority of the bomb debris/fission reaction products and people on the ground for a number of crucial days before it falls out of the atmosphere in a comparatively dilute fashion, this [...] "delayed fallout" [...] is henceforth not an immediate concern to those near the blast. On the other hand, the only time that fallout is rapidly concentrated in a potentially lethal fashion in the local/regional area around the explosion is when the nuclear fireball makes contact with the ground surface, with an explosion that does so, being aptly termed a surface burst. For example, in the Operation Crossroads tests of 1946 on Bikini Atoll, using two explosive devices of the same design and yield, the first, Test Able (an air burst) had little local fallout, but the infamous Test Baker a near surface shallow (underwater burst) left the local test targets badly contaminated with radioactive fallout.|$|E

5000|$|The common MGV chassis was {{required}} to provide full protection from 30 mm and 45 mm cannon fire in a 60 degree arc opening towards {{the front of the}} vehicle. 360 degree protection from small arms fire up to 14.5 mm heavy machine gun and 155 mm artillery shell <b>air-bursts</b> was planned.

50|$|The first radar {{proximity}} fuzes (codenamed 'VT') {{were initially}} used against aircraft in World War II. Their ground use was delayed {{for fear of}} the enemy recovering 'blinds' (artillery shells which failed to detonate) and copying the fuze. The first proximity fuzes were designed to detonate about 30 ft above the ground. These <b>air-bursts</b> are much more lethal against personnel than ground bursts because they deliver {{a greater proportion of}} useful fragments and deliver them into terrain where a prone soldier would be protected from ground bursts.|$|R

50|$|More recently, the {{development}} of the S&T Daewoo K11 dual-barrel <b>air-burst</b> weapon, which uses 5.56×45mm NATO and 20×30mm <b>air-burst</b> grenade, prompted the Republic of Korea Armed Forces to plan for the replacements of all K2 rifles in service with the K11, making K11 the standard service rifle for the armed forces. However, due to the K11's extremely high cost and weight for a standard rifle, the armed forces scrapped its original plan and decided to provide 2 K11 per squad in order to increase firepower. The K2 was retained as the standard service rifle as a result.|$|E

50|$|The {{artillery}} miniature range or Nutt {{range was}} invented by Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Charles Rothery Nutt DSO {{as a method of}} training for the Royal Artillery. Nutt invented his range as a prisoner of war. In his book, History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery:Between the wars, 1919-39, Sir Martin Farndale writes about the Nutt Range '..whose whirring and complicated machinery reproduced exactly the result of the fire orders given in the form of tiny puffs of cigarette smoke or shrapnel <b>air-bursts</b> of cotton wool let down on strings’.|$|R
50|$|The central idea of {{the program}} was to develop a rifle that enabled the attacking of targets behind cover by using {{airburst}} munitions. The munitions were to be much smaller than pre-existing grenades and grenade launchers, but large enough to be effective. The idea was refined into a combination of a short assault rifle and semi-automatic, low-velocity cannon firing <b>air-bursting</b> munitions. The OICW aimed to use advances in computer technology in a weapon that fired grenades automatically pre-set to explode above or beside targets hidden from view. Fragmentation from the exploding grenades could hit the target when normal rifle fire could not.|$|R
50|$|These shelters were {{specially}} designed and constructed {{to protect the}} GLCMs and crews against nuclear and conventional strikes. They were about 10 m high, with a reinforced 2 m thick concrete ceiling. Below was a massive titanium plate, 3 m of sand and a reinforced concrete plate. The shelters were completely covered with tons of clay.Each shelter was equipped with three hydraulic nuclear blast proof doors at both ends to assure a quick entry or exit.They were designed to withstand the blast of an <b>air-bursting</b> nuclear explosion above the base or a direct hit from a 2500 lb conventional bomb.|$|R
50|$|The RGO's {{time delay}} fuze {{prevents}} friendly casualties if it impacts too soon or will <b>air-burst</b> over an enemy under cover if it hadn't impacted. The impact fuze detonates {{when it hits}} any terrain - even sand, snow, or water.|$|E
50|$|The {{shock wave}} from an {{explosion}} can be reflected by an inversion layer {{in much the}} same way as it bounces off the ground in an <b>air-burst</b> and can cause additional damage as a result.

Also many modern armies have canister shot ammunition for tank and artillery guns, the XM1028 round for the 120 mm M256 tank gun being one example (approx 1150 tungsten balls at 1400 m/s).|$|R
25|$|A minor {{nuclear war}} with each country using 50 Hiroshima-sized atom bombs as <b>air-bursts</b> on urban areas could produce climate change {{unprecedented}} in recorded human history. A nuclear {{war between the}} United States and Russia today could produce nuclear winter, with temperatures plunging below freezing in the summer in major agricultural regions, threatening the food supply {{for most of the}} planet. The climatic effects of the smoke from burning cities and industrial areas would last for several years, much longer than previously thought. New climate model simulations, which are said to have the capability of including the entire atmosphere and oceans, show that the smoke would be lofted by solar heating to the upper stratosphere, where it would remain for years.|$|R
50|$|By the 20th century, fortifications {{were being}} {{designed}} {{with as much}} surrounding embankment by earthworks as possible. While this provided some protection from direct fire, it made defense against infantry more difficult, and did nothing to protect from high trajectory fire landing from above, or from <b>air-bursting</b> explosive shells, which rained the area enclosed by walls with shrapnel. In Bermuda, {{in the latter part}} of the 19th Century, where the War Office had expended vast fortunes building up fortifications to protect the Royal Naval Dockyard, it was decided belatedly that the Dockyard's own fleet of naval vessels could provide a more effective defence. With the advent of the aeroplane, and the missile, fixed artillery was both obsolete and too vulnerable to continue in use. The last coastal artillery was removed from use in the 1950s.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAcoustic {{coupling}} between solid Earth {{and atmosphere}} {{has been observed}} since the 1960 s, first from ground-based seismic, pressure, and ionospheric sensors and since 20 years with various satellite measurements, including with global positioning system (GPS) satellites. This coupling leads to the excitation of the Rayleigh surface waves by local atmospheric sources such as large natural explosions from volcanoes, meteor atmospheric <b>air-bursts,</b> or artificial explosions. It contributes also in the continuous excitation of Rayleigh waves and associated normal modes by atmospheric winds and pressure fluctuations. The same coupling allows the observation of Rayleigh waves in the thermosphere {{most of the time}} through ionospheric monitoring with Doppler sounders or GPS. The authors review briefly in this paper observations made on Earth and describe the general frame of the theory enabling the computation of Rayleigh waves for models of telluric planets with atmosphere. The authors then focus on Mars and Venus and give in both cases the atmospheric properties of the Rayleigh normal modes and associated surface waves compared to Earth. The authors then conclude on the observation perspectives especially for Rayleigh waves excited by atmospheric sources on Mars and for remote ionospheric observations of Rayleigh waves excited by quakes on Venus...|$|R
50|$|The Lightweight Small Arms Technologies {{program is}} the {{culmination}} of much research and information obtained by the US Army. It succeeds several other programs to develop new small arms technologies, each program of which produced results that were infeasible or insignificant. The first three (the Special Purpose Individual Weapon, the Future Rifle Program, and the Advanced Combat Rifle program) demonstrated the ballistic problems of flechette ammunition, and the ACR program also showed the inability of kinetic-energy firearms to significantly compensate for human inaccuracy (the small accuracy increase of all of the concepts tested was out-weighed by the trade-offs required). The subsequent identification of programmable <b>air-bursting</b> munitions as the only way to significantly increase accuracy was followed by the fourth, and most recent, cancelled program—the OICW program. The ability to detonate an explosive in the air at range provided a huge increase in accuracy, but the resultant XM29 proved too heavy to use. The separation of the XM29 into the XM25 and the XM8 provided no long-term solution to the weight problem, and the program was suspended indefinitely. Developments in lighter weapons (such as LSAT) could see a return to the concept, although the military has not recently expressed a desire for a return. The indefinite suspension of the program sounded the death of short-term advances in infantry weapon lethality, and indicated the shift to other projects.|$|R
50|$|Advantages of hydro-mechanical drain {{cleaners}} {{are their}} eco-friendliness (most use only tap water), {{their ability to}} dislodge and remove clogs like sand or cat litter that 'back-fill when using a conventional snake, and their friendliness to plumbing joints. Unlike <b>air-burst</b> cleaners, hydro-mechanical drain cleaners do not pressurize plumbing joints. On some models of hydro-mechanical drain cleaner both hot and cold water can be used, providing added cleaning power for fat, protein, or other easily melting drain clogs.|$|E
50|$|A {{study has}} been {{published}} showing a correlation between historic reports of coloured rains and of meteors; {{the author of the}} paper, Patrick McCafferty, stated that sixty of these events (coloured rain), or 36%, were linked to meteoritic or cometary activity.
