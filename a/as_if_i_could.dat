500|$|Let {{the object}} of affection be {{snatched}} away by death, and how is all the pain ever inflicted upon them avenged! The same imagination that led us to slight or overlook their sufferings, {{now that they are}} forever lost to us, magnifies their estimable qualities ... How did I feel this when my daughter, Allegra, died! While she lived, her existence never seemed necessary to my happiness; but no sooner did I lose her, than it appeared to me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not live without her.|$|E
6000|$|It was Sammy Jay's turn to grin, [...] "Just <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{tell you}} any news, Reddy Fox! Just <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> tell you any news!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Why, {{everybody}} knows that you are so smart that you find out everything {{as soon as it}} happens." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{compressed}} {{her lips}} with an angry glance at me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> help her wrinkles, then she sighed.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Would {{you take}} that?' she said, {{holding out a}} three-penny piece. 'I'd make it twice <b>as</b> much <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> but times are hard.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear fellow, you can't see ideas--especially such highly {{ethereal}} ones <b>as</b> mine. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{only see}} it myself--that {{would be a}} great step in advance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If He's {{as good as}} {{your father}} He'll do for me," [...] said Mary. [...] "When your father was talking to me <b>I</b> felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> be bad any more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know—only I feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> talk {{straight}} off without arranging—like birds, {{without knowing what}} note is coming next." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, that am I. I feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> eat {{a buffalo}} alive. Why, it's my 'pinion we've tasted nothin' since daybreak this mornin'." ...|$|E
60|$|What {{shocking}} bad writing I {{have sent}} you; I don't know [how] it is, but [it] seems <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not write any better.|$|E
6000|$|Oh, Undy, as high <b>as</b> Haman, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could!</b> <b>as</b> high <b>as</b> Haman! and <b>if</b> not in Lombard Street, then on {{that open}} ground where Waterloo Place bisects Pall Mall, {{so that all}} the clubs might see thee! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Show {{me how to}} grow pious, strong, and useful, as you are," [...] she said. [...] "I am all wrong, {{and feel}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> get right again, for I haven't energy enough to care what becomes of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am your brother,' {{replied the}} stranger, 'and I have {{returned}} home without the money I {{hoped to have}} made. And, what is worse, they tell me in the village that my father is dead. I would have counted my lost gold <b>as</b> nothing <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have seen him once more.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{shake his}} old bones up sometimes!" [...] cried Mrs. Simpson viciously. [...] "But who's for a 'arf of fourpenny?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} if courage is needed," [...] Kit replied, forcing a smile. [...] "It looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> no longer meddle with politics." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much, my master! The fall is hurting me delightfully. I almost feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> cry, {{and that would}} be joy indeed!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{harrowing}} old man, Mis'ess Yeobright," [...] said Christian despondingly. [...] "I wouldn't {{live with}} him a week, so playward <b>as</b> he is, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, no!' exclaimed Sophy; 'I {{often feel}} {{so sick of}} lying here, that <b>I</b> feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> be sulky <b>if</b> only <b>I</b> might walk about, and go from one room to another when I please! But papa, you will let me be {{admitted}} into the Church when I am able, will you not?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Norah!" [...] {{she said}} to herself, tenderly; [...] "I wonder if Norah is {{thinking}} of me? Oh, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be <b>as</b> patient <b>as</b> she is! <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only forget the debt we owe to Michael Vanstone!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nellie!" [...] gasped the sufferer. [...] "Oh, yes, Nellie! <b>As</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{ever forget}} her! Say, Dick, how soon will I see her, do you suppose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, thank you," [...] Ralph said, [...] "and {{in spite}} of the sleep I have had, I feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go off again till morning, comfortably." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dick laughed feebly. [...] "It will be {{some time}} before there is much of a giant about me. Tom; but I feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> drink some broth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You said, 'What {{the devil}} {{are we doing}} at this hockey? We ought to be {{drilling}} or shooting against those confounded Germans!' ... I've never forgotten it.... I ought to have done it before. I've been a scout-master. In a little while they will want officers. In London, I'm told, {{there are a lot}} of officers' training corps putting men through the work as quickly <b>as</b> possible.... <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nothing--but feel {{kindly to}} Gilbert,' said Albinia. 'I can't do so yet. <b>I</b> don't feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>could</b> again, when <b>I</b> {{think what he}} was doing with Maurice. Yes, and how easily he could have brought poor Lucy to her senses, if he had been good for anything! Oh! Maurice, this is sickening work! You should be {{grateful}} to me for not scolding you for having taken me from home!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] I protested. [...] "We, too, {{have our}} {{sentiment}}, the sentiment of places as well <b>as</b> of people. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> choose where to die I {{think that it}} would be here, with my windows wide open and the roar of the incoming tide in my ears." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stopped to}} kiss me on the forehead, and I sobbed and wept afresh. For I felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not bear the painful delight of his praise.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think any}} one {{is capable of}} balking you, cara mia. Certainly I, for one, should never dream of trying. But I don't feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> co-operate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll be {{full-fledged}} sailors {{before this}} voyage is over," [...] remarked Roger to his chums. [...] "I declare, I almost feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> handle a small ship already." ...|$|E
60|$|But already I {{had seen}} and heard enough; too much, indeed, for my peace of mind. I crept away through the swamp, the eager calls {{following}} me even to my canoe; first a plaint, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> something were lacking to the placid lake and quiet woods and the soft beauty of twilight; and then a faint question, always heard in the kwit of a partridge, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> only <b>I</b> <b>could</b> explain why two eager voices would never again answer to roll call when the shadows lengthened.|$|R
6000|$|... "Helping me to forget, you mean. No, not one. Time {{has taught}} me the way to vegetate; and so I {{no longer need to}} live. As you have remarked, I have habits, not active {{principles}}. But one at least of these principles is blossoming again even <b>as</b> <b>I</b> speak. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only live <b>as</b> that lily lives now!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} all," [...] said Bertha, [...] "better than you think. But none so well as her. Not even you, father. There is nothing half so real and so true about me <b>as</b> she is. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be {{restored}} to sight this instant, and not a word were spoken, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> choose her from a crowd! My sister!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't know. I {{like people}} to be so kind, that I can't feel as if I would pay them off, but <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do nothing but love them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do jus five minutes' sleep. You {{keep your}} eyes on de shed, and ef you hear any officer coming his rounds you wake me up." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{she clung}} so closely about me, {{that it seemed}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never escape out of her arms, and I felt as if my heart must break in twain.|$|E
60|$|I {{have not}} had courage to write, my dearest friend, but you will not have been severe on me. I have {{suffered}} very much--from suspense as well <b>as</b> from certainty. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> open my heart to you it would please me that your sympathy should see all; but I can't write, and I couldn't speak of that. It is well for those who in their griefs can speak and write. <b>I</b> never <b>could.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear sister, if you {{consider}} my unhappy state, how can she be any comfort to me? Here am I, a poor desolate widow, deprived {{of the best of}} husbands, my health gone in attending and nursing him, my spirits still worse, all my peace in this world destroyed, with hardly enough to support me in the rank of a gentlewoman, and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the memory of the dear departed--what possible comfort <b>could</b> <b>I</b> have in taking such a charge upon me <b>as</b> Fanny? <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> wish it for my own sake, I would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl. She is in good hands, and sure of doing well. I must struggle through my sorrows and difficulties as I can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Lord bless you, sir,' said Mark, 'you don't half know me, though. I don't {{believe there}} ever was a man as could come out so strong under {{circumstances}} that would make other men miserable, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only get a chance. But I can't get a chance. It's my opinion that nobody never will know half of what's in me, unless something very unexpected turns up. And I don't see any prospect of that. I'm a-going to leave the Dragon, sir.' ...|$|R
