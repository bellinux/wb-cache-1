5|$|<b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ravine from Cave 1 on {{the other}} Stupa hill is a large hall known as Sitabai's temple cave. The portico has four pillars and two pilasters. The hall has 3 {{chambers}} at the back, the central one a shrine and the rest for monks or priests. The door of the central shrine has pilasters and a frieze, with the threshold decorated with lion figures. The sanctum has no image now, but is similar to Linga shrine on the island.|$|E
5|$|The cloth {{support is}} visible {{in areas where the}} paint was thinly applied. Rusty nail holes {{can be seen in the}} lower border and <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> picture in an area of sky that was {{initially}} covered by frame. They indicate that the woodworking was positioned much lower than Bouts had intended; generally works painted on commission were placed by professional joiners who worked independently of the painter. The low placing of the frame however protected the underlying colours over the centuries from light; they are preserved as first laid down. The panel was originally attached to its frame by pegs and nails; the nails would have been used to attach the linen to the underlying wooden frame.|$|E
5|$|The {{head has}} {{a less than}} {{triangular}} shape with a blunt and rounded snout. Still, the head is much wider than the neck. The rostral scale is small. The circumorbital ring consists of 10–16 scales. <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head, there are 7–11 interocular scales. 3–4 scales separate the suboculars and the supralabials. There are 12–17 supralabials and 13–17 sublabials. The first 3–4 sublabials contact the chin shields, of which {{there is only one}} pair. Often, there are two fangs on each maxilla and both can be functional.|$|E

5|$|The HTC Dream was {{the first}} ever {{smartphone}} to ship with the Android operating system. The operating system heavily integrates with, and provides apps for various Google services, such as Gmail (with push email support), Maps, Search, Talk, and YouTube, while the contacts and calendar apps can sync with the online Google Contacts and Google Calendar services respectively. The device also ships with an email app supporting other POP3 and IMAP-based mail services, an instant messaging app with support for multiple services, and a WebKit-based web browser. A notification system displays icons for certain events (such as e-mails and text messages) {{on the left side}} of the status bar <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> screen; dragging down from the top of the screen exposes a tray with more detailed information for each notification. The Android Market can be used to download additional apps for the device. The G1 as sold by T-Mobile also shipped with an Amazon MP3 app, allowing users to purchase DRM-free music online, and download them straight to the device via Wi-Fi.|$|E

For security reasons, the Montana Power Company closed the dam to such foot traffic during World War II and never allowed it to resume afterward.|$|E
25|$|Horsemen in the Sassanid cavalry {{lacked a}} stirrup. Instead, {{they used a}} war saddle which had a cantle at the back and two guard clamps which curved <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rider's thighs. This allowed the {{horsemen}} {{to stay in the}} saddle at all times during the battle, especially during violent encounters.|$|E
25|$|Head {{distinct}} from neck, snout very short and rounded. The nostril between three shields, and head covered with small keeled scales, among which an enlarged supraocular is sometimes present. There are 9-14 interocular scales <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head and 14-21 circumorbital scales. 1-3 rows of scales separate the eye from the supralabials. There are 10-12 supralabials, the fourth usually largest, and 10-13 sublabials.|$|E

25|$|Ballet {{shoes are}} soft, pliable shoes made of canvas or leather, with either {{continuous}} or two-part sole (also called split-sole), used for ballet dancing. The sole is typically made of leather, with thicker material under {{the ball and}} heel of the foot, and thinner and thus more flexible material under the arch so that the foot can be easily pointed. They are typically secured by elastics <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot.|$|E
25|$|All {{species in}} the genus Zaprionus are easily {{identified}} by the longitudinal white stripes bordered by black stripes running <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head and thorax. Species of the subgenus Zaprionus have 4 or 6 white stripes while the species of the subgenus Anaprionus have 5 or 7 white stripes. The general body color varies across species from yellowish to dark brown. Several species of the subgenus Zaprionus have one or more stout and sometimes composite spines on the forelegs.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{requirement}} to operate at an altitude of 24,000m (78,700ft) for 48 hours, Grob designed a twin-engined aircraft with a straight, very high aspect ratio wing of 56.5m (185ft 4½in) span. The wings featured winglets, and were mounted <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuselage which terminated in a T-tail configuration. The aircraft was designed to be crewed by two pilots, and could accommodate two scientists and associated mission equipment in a pressurised cabin. A galley, rest facilities and a toilet were provided.|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} {{mechanism of}} ventilation in VIP latrines is {{the action of}} wind blowing <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vent pipe. The wind creates a strong circulation of air through the superstructure, down through the squat hole, across the pit and {{up and out of}} the vent pipe. Unpleasant fecal odors from the pit contents are thus sucked up and exhausted out of vent pipe, leaving the superstructure odor-free. In some cases solar-powered fans are added giving a constant outwards flow from the vent pipe.|$|E
25|$|At first, the seven-core cables {{were carried}} inside cast iron pipes, on short wooden spikes, {{a few feet}} from the side of the railway line. But from January 1843, the public were treated to the sight of {{telegraph}} wires against the sky line, <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> viaduct, for the first time. Cooke had renegotiated the contract with the GWR and extended the telegraph to Slough, using a simpler two-needle instrument that could be supplied with just two wires suspended from porcelain insulators on poles.|$|E
25|$|With modern strap bindings, {{the rider}} wears a boot {{which has a}} thick but {{flexible}} sole, and padded uppers. The foot is held onto the board with two buckle straps – one strapped <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> toe area, and one across the ankle area. They can be tightly ratcheted closed for a tight fit and good rider control of the board. Straps are typically padded to more evenly distribute pressure across the foot. While nowhere near as popular as two-strap bindings, some people prefer three-strap bindings for more specialized riding such as carving. The third strap tends to provide additional stiffness to the binding.|$|E

25|$|<b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{trapping}} pit was a thick stick or pole, and on {{this was}} fastened a plank, which covered {{the top of the}} trap. On one end of this plank was a piece of venison, and on the other a stone. The way the trap was meant to work was this: The wolf would come to the venison, and just as it got on the plank to eat it, the plank would turn, causing the wolf to fall into the pit. The weight of the stone at the other end would bring the plank up again, ready baited for another wolf.|$|E
25|$|It {{stretches}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North American continent, {{reaching into}} the Arctic Circle. The region consists of the following: many islands, such as Victoria Island, the Mackenzie River, and Great Bear and Great Slave lakes. Over half the people are Inuit and First Nations peoples. In the 18th century, the main land was explored by Samuel Hearne for the Hudson's Bay Company and by Alexander Mackenzie. European settlers were mainly whalers, fur traders, and missionaries until the 1920s, when oil was discovered and the territorial administration had formed. The principal industry is now mining, and centers of the petroleum and Natural Gas fields in the western Arctic coastal regions.|$|E
25|$|Traffic on {{the canal}} was never {{particularly}} heavy, for even in October 1821, when the canal was most prosperous, {{there were only}} about nine laden boats per day using it. Despite this, water supply was a regular problem. When first built, the canal was supplied by a reservoir at Shipley, constructed by building a dam across the valley {{at the end of}} the canal. The resultant lake provided an attractive feature for Shipley Hall, but flooded the coach road which provided access to it, and so a new bridge and road <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dam were constructed. The reservoir was further topped up by a feeder from the stream above Hawley's Pond.|$|E
