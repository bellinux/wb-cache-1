5|$|Numerous senior central {{bankers and}} finance ministers issued public warnings, the first being Alexei Ulyukayev, the first deputy {{chairman}} at Russia's central bank. He was later joined by many others including Park Jae-wan, the finance minister for South Korea, and by Jens Weidmann, {{president of the}} Bundesbank. Weidmann held the view that interventions during the 2009–11 period were not intense enough to count as competitive devaluation, but that a genuine currency war is now <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>possibility.</b> Japan's economy minister Akira Amari {{has said that the}} Bank of Japan's bond buying programme is intended to combat deflation, and not to weaken the yen.|$|E
5|$|Although the Boleyn {{family still}} held {{important}} {{positions on the}} Privy Council, Anne had many enemies, including the Duke of Suffolk. Even her own uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, had come to resent her attitude to her power. The Boleyns preferred France over the Emperor as a potential ally, but the King's favour had swung towards the latter (partly because of Cromwell), damaging the family's influence. Also opposed to Anne were supporters of reconciliation with Princess Mary (among them the former supporters of Catherine), who had reached maturity. A second annulment was now <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>possibility,</b> although it is commonly {{believed that it was}} Cromwell's anti-Boleyn influence that led opponents to look for a way of having her executed.|$|E
5|$|Mark Webster, {{an expert}} {{instructed}} by Bamber's defence team, argued that Hayward's tests had been inadequate, {{and that there}} was <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>possibility,</b> not a remote one, that the blood had come from Nevill and June. This was a critical point, because the prosecution case rested on the silencer having been on the gun when Sheila was shot, something she could not have done herself because of the length of her arms. If she was shot with the silencer on the gun, it meant that someone else had shot her. If her blood was inside the silencer, it supported the prosecution's position that she had been shot by another party, but if the blood inside the silencer belonged to someone else, that part of the prosecution case collapsed.|$|E

25|$|A few testing {{sessions}} with F1 teams including Jordan suggested another comeback {{could be on}} the cards, but it never happened.

25|$|During his tenure, {{the church}} faced {{a number of}} legal battles with the United States, {{primarily}} over the practice of plural marriage.

25|$|The {{assassination}} {{caused the}} Palestine partition proposals that were awaiting final approval in Cabinet to be immediately shelved and never resurrected. Moyne's successor in Cairo, Sir Edward Grigg, {{was opposed to}} partition.

25|$|New York was {{the largest}} state in the union, and victory there was <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>possibility.</b> Catt agreed to turn the New York work over to others and to accept the NAWSA {{presidency}} in December, 1915 {{on the condition that}} she could name her own executive board, which previously had always been elected by the annual convention. She appointed to the board women of independent means who could work for the movement full-time.|$|E
25|$|By the 1850s, however, Confessional Lutheranism {{was enjoying}} a resurgence. In 1864, the General Synod's {{constitution}} was amended to require synods {{to accept the}} Augsburg Confession as a correct presentation of fundamental doctrines. By 1913, all of the Lutheran confessions had been officially adopted by the General Synod. While doctrines and practices contradicting the confessions were still tolerated in the General Synod, the moves toward a more orthodox and confessional position made a merger with the Lutheran General Council <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>possibility.</b>|$|E

50|$|There is <b>a</b> very <b>real</b> <b>possibility</b> {{for fraud}} when SMS banking is involved, as SMS uses {{insecure}} encryption and is easily spoofable (see the SMS page for details).

25|$|The {{price of}} land was the {{dominant}} election issue: The business strategy of the Canterbury Association was to sell land at a price that was sufficient to finance all the development that was necessary for the new settlement. The other two candidates, James FitzGerald and Henry Tancred, were therefore both proponents of a high land price. Campbell {{on the other hand}} was in favour of setting a low price for land outside the Canterbury Block. Hence there was <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>possibility</b> that vote splitting would result in neither Tancred nor FitzGerald being elected.|$|E
25|$|The three Court of Appeal judges {{agreed that}} there was, in fact, <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>possibility</b> of bias by the Chief Magistrate in his ruling. Information that {{surfaced}} later on, linked Chief Magistrate McNicolls to a multimillion-dollar land deal and a company associated {{with one of}} the main witnesses in the Basdeo Panday trial. This information, along with the fact that Chief Magistrate McNicolls refused to give evidence for the criminal prosecution of the Chief Justice, which caused that prosecution to fail, were the main arguments used by Panday's lawyers in his Appeal Court hearing.|$|E
25|$|In 1940 Wrighton of Walthamstow {{took over}} Sansom's garage {{opposite}} the Chilcote Memorial; up to 300 people worked there manufacturing aircraft parts (including for the Short Sunderland flying-boat) {{for the war}} effort. After the Fall of France the invasion of Britain became <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>possibility,</b> and machine-gun posts and pillboxes were built across the coastline of Torquay and the Bay. In Torquay the work {{was done by the}} Royal East Kent Regiment nicknamed 'The Buffs'. Naval guns were placed on Corbyn Head, in a repeat of its fortification against the troops of Napoleon over a century before.|$|E

25|$|Luton laboured {{once again}} in 1994–95, with the side {{struggling}} to score at home. Pleat's Luton side, including young players such as Oakes, Telfer and John Hartson, reacted positively when Pleat turned down the advances of Tottenham Hotspur to return to North London as General Manager, and rocketed up to fifth in the table, and for perhaps {{the first time in}} three seasons of Division One football, promotion was looking <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>possibility.</b> Hartson was bought by Arsenal for £2,500,000 soon after – a then-British record for a teenager. The season petered out into obscurity following Hartson's sale, and Luton finished 16th.|$|E
25|$|However, Leeds {{started the}} 1985–86 badly and relegation to the Third Division became <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>possibility,</b> causing Gray to be sacked {{in favour of}} another Revie teammate, former Leeds and Scotland captain Billy Bremner. Bremner carried on where Gray had left off, but found it just as {{difficult}} to achieve promotion, though he did bring the club close to success. Under Bremner, the club were defeated 2–1 in the 1987 play-off final, after extra time, against Charlton Athletic and, in the same year, were beaten 3–2 (after extra-time) in the FA Cup semi-final, losing to eventual winners Coventry City. In October 1988, with the team standing at 21st position in the Second Division, Bremner was fired {{to make way for}} Howard Wilkinson.|$|E
25|$|If an adjudicator has a pecuniary or {{monetary}} {{interest in}} the matter {{he or she is}} presiding over, no matter how small it is, he or she is automatically disqualified from making the decision. The decision, if made, may be set aside. Thus, in Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal Proprietors (1852), the House of Lords held that the Lord Chancellor, who was a shareholder of one of the companies that was a party to certain legal proceedings he was presiding over, was disqualified from hearing the case. His ruling had to be annulled. This was not because there was <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>possibility</b> of bias, but because the situation created a possibility that a reasonable person might suspect the existence of bias, which would taint the fairness of the proceedings.|$|E

50|$|The 2d Battalion, 4th Infantry {{participated in}} major {{exercises}} each winter at training {{areas such as}} Baumholder, Hohenfels Hohenfels, Wildflecken, and Grafenwoehr.

50|$|In 1943, a despondent Edsel Ford died {{of stomach}} cancer.

His mental state was also questionable, and there was <b>a</b> very <b>real</b> <b>possibility</b> that the company would collapse if he died or became incapacitated. The Roosevelt Administration had a contingency plan in place to nationalize Ford if need be so that they wouldn't lose vital military production.|$|R
25|$|Queen Juliana faced another crisis {{among her}} Protestant {{citizens}} in 1963, when her second daughter Irene secretly converted to Roman Catholicism and, without government approval, on 29 April 1964 married Prince Carlos Hugo of Bourbon, Duke of Parma, a claimant to the Spanish throne {{and also a}} leader in Spain's Carlist party. With memories of the Dutch struggle for independence from Roman Catholic Spain and fascist German oppression still fresh {{in the minds of}} the Dutch people, the events leading to the marriage were played out in all the newspapers and a storm of hostility erupted against the monarchy for allowing it to happen—a matter so serious that the queen's abdication became <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>possibility.</b> She survived, however, thanks to the underlying devotion she had earned over the years.|$|E
25|$|After {{the initial}} report of {{apparent}} superluminal velocities of neutrinos, most physicists {{in the field}} were quietly skeptical of the results, but prepared to adopt a wait-and-see approach. Experimental experts {{were aware of the}} complexity and difficulty of the measurement, so an extra unrecognized measurement error was still <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>possibility,</b> despite the care taken by the OPERA team. However, because of the widespread interest, several well-known experts did make public comments. Nobel laureates Steven Weinberg, George Smoot III, and Carlo Rubbia, and other physicists not affiliated with the experiment, including Michio Kaku, expressed skepticism about the accuracy of the experiment on the basis that the results challenged a long-held theory consistent with the results of many other tests of special relativity. Nevertheless, Ereditato, the OPERA spokesperson, stated that no one had an explanation that invalidated the experiment's results.|$|E
25|$|In April 2010, {{with the}} hopes {{of being part of}} a golden era at the Wildcats, Redhage re-signed with the team on a three-year deal. However, on 23 January 2011, his season came to an end after dislocating his hip during the Wildcats' 77–76 loss to the Adelaide 36ers in Adelaide. It was {{originally}} feared that it could be a career-ending injury with there being <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>possibility</b> at the time of him requiring a hip replacement. The injury occurred after Redhage lunged for a contested ball in a way that punched the head of his femur through his pelvis, breaking the bone and dislocating the joint. For the first time since joining the Wildcats in 2005, Redhage was injured and out of action. The Wildcats lost four consecutive games after their skipper was whisked to the US for surgery, winning only two from the remaining eight. Despite missing {{the second half of the}} season, Redhage shared the Gordon Ellis Medal with Kevin Lisch for 2010/11.|$|E
