40|$|Despite a high {{probability}} of response to first-line chemotherapy, most patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) will eventually have progression of their disease because {{of the development of}} resistant disease. Second-line testing of new drugs is an accepted research strategy in SCLC. In this context, the Italian Lung Cancer Task Force (FONICAP) has tested a new synthetic bifunctional alkylating agent, <b>Ambamustine,</b> with preliminary evidence of activity in other solid tumors. Patients with measurable SCLC, progressive after one first-line chemotherapy regimen (either "sensitive" or "refractory"), were eligible for the study. <b>Ambamustine</b> was administered at the dose of 2 mg/kg as a 1 -hour intravenous infusion on day 1 every 21 days. The dose was to be increased to 3 mg/kg if no grade IV toxicity and complete hematologic recovery had occurred by day 22. Sample size was calculated according to a two-stage optimal Simon's design. Seventeen patients were entered into the study. Twelve patients were refractory to prior chemotherapy; 12 had extensive disease; the median age was 64 years (range: 46 - 75 years) and the median performance status was 1. Among 13 patients who received more than one cycle, 9 patients could increase <b>Ambamustine</b> dose from 2 to 3 mg/kg. No objective response was observed: one patient obtained a 50 % regression of the primary tumor with contemporary disease progression in the liver and was qualified as having progressive disease. The treatment was well tolerated: grade IV leukopenia occurred in only 1 patient; grade III anemia occurred in 17. 6 %, grade III leukopenia in 11. 8 %, and grade III thrombocytopenia in 23. 5 %. Nonhematologic toxicity was minimal. <b>Ambamustine,</b> at the dose and schedule used in this study, is well tolerated in pretreated patients with SCLC but has no significant antitumor activity in this unfavorable group of patients...|$|E
40|$|The comet test is a {{reported}} method for measuring DNA damage in individual mammalian cells, In the present report, {{the ability of}} this test to detect multidrug resistance (MDR) was evaluated. For this purpose, two human leukemia, well-characterized parental cell lines, HL 60 and GEM, and their derived multidrug-resistant cells, HL 60 /DNR and CEM/VBL, were cultured with or without different anti-cancer agents. To evaluate the comet test, two DNA-damaging agents were used: daunorubicin (DNR), which is involved in MDR, and <b>ambamustine</b> (AMBA), which is independent from MDR. Moreover, in order to evaluate the specificity of the comet test, the activity of vinblastine (VBL), an MDR-related, DNA-independent anti-cancer drug, was also tested. Finally, the specificity of the comet test in detecting MDR was confirmed by culturing parental or resistant cells with DNR {{with or without the}} revertant agent verapamil (VER). Results confirm that the comet test is able to predict cellular chemoresistance when DNA damaging agents are tested. Finally, experiments {{on the role of the}} comet test in evaluating certain aspects of DNA repair are discussed...|$|E
