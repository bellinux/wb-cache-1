50|$|Levaillant's cuckoo is a brood {{parasite}} and {{the female}} lays her eggs in the nest of another species of bird, typically the southern pied babbler (Turdoides bicolor), the bare-cheeked babbler (Turdoides gymnogenys), the Hartlaub's babbler (Turdoides hartlaubii) or the <b>arrow-marked</b> <b>babbler</b> (Turdoides jardineii). Both {{the male and female}} cuckoo fly around acrobatically to distract the host birds. The male continues the distraction while the female lays the egg. Unlike many other species of cuckoo, the newly-hatched cuckoo chick does not push the other eggs and nestlings out of the nest. It leaves the nest after about ten days and becomes independent in four to six weeks.|$|E
