5|$|The massive {{amount of}} {{exponentially}} growing sequence data is a daunting challenge that {{is complicated by the}} complexity of the metadata associated with metagenomic projects. Metadata includes detailed information about the three-dimensional (including depth, or height) geography and environmental features of the sample, physical data about the sample site, and the methodology of the sampling. This information is necessary both to ensure replicability and to enable downstream analysis. Because of its importance, metadata <b>and</b> <b>collaborative</b> data review and curation require standardized data formats located in specialized databases, such as the Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD).|$|E
5|$|Kurtzman, a cartoonist, {{created the}} series at the {{culmination}} of his career. He had launched Mad magazine, worked briefly for Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner and {{on a series of}} solo <b>and</b> <b>collaborative</b> projects, then returned to working for Hefner with Little Annie Fanny. Each episode of the comic strip was designed and written by Kurtzman and rendered in oil, tempera, and watercolor by Elder. Hefner edited each episode, often requiring detailed changes to ensure that the series remained true to the magazine's editorial style. Critical reaction was mixed, with most praising the elaborate, fully painted comic, but some dismissing it as falling short of Kurtzman's full potential. The complete series was first collected into two volumes in 2000 and 2001 by Dark Horse Comics.|$|E
5|$|Students explore broad {{learning}} themes at {{each level}} {{that allow them to}} learn across subjects and engage them in creative <b>and</b> <b>collaborative</b> projects. The second group, for example, spends much of their year on the study of trees, using trees as a focus for biology, mathematics, art, and creative writing. Students adopt and study a personal space in the nearby forest preserve. The year culminates with the tapping of maple trees to make syrup, which they share {{with the rest of the}} school. Each group engages different themes and group projects. Lower school students simulate an airplane flight to Paris and host a Japanese luncheon. The fourth group holds a Native American Fair, the fifth group creates an original Egyptian style mastaba, the sixth group presents a World's Fair, and the eighth group organizes an Immigration and Ethnic Fair.|$|E
