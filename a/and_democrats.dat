5|$|As {{a lifelong}} Democrat, Beauregard worked to end Republican rule during Reconstruction. His {{outrage over the}} {{perceived}} excesses of Reconstruction was a principal source for his indecision about remaining in the United States and his flirtation with foreign armies, which lasted until 1875. He {{was active in the}} Reform Party, an association of conservative New Orleans businessmen, which spoke in favor of civil rights and voting for former slaves, hoping to form alliances between African-Americans <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> to vote out the Radical Republicans in the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Early in his term, Breathitt won favor {{from both}} Whigs <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> by {{opposing}} South Carolina's actions during the Nullification Crisis. Following Breathitt's lead, {{the state legislature}} passed resolutions condemning the doctrine of nullification on February 2, 1833. This action was particularly significant because John C. Calhoun's justification for nullification was largely based on the 1799 Kentucky Resolutions.|$|E
5|$|However, {{because of}} {{political}} infighting between Liberal Republicans <b>and</b> <b>Democrats,</b> and due to several campaign blunders, the physically ailing Greeley {{was no match for}} Grant, who won in a landslide. Grant won 286 of the 352 Electoral College votes, and received 55.8 {{percent of the popular vote}} nationwide. The President's reelection victory also brought an overwhelming Republican majority into both house of Congress. Heartbroken after a hard fought political campaign, Greeley died a few weeks after the election. Out of respect for Greeley, Grant attended his funeral.|$|E

5|$|In 1862 Morton {{attended}} the Loyal War Governors' Conference in Altoona, Pennsylvania, organized by Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Gregg Curtin, that gave Lincoln the support needed for his Emancipation Proclamation. Emancipation and the conscription {{of men to}} fight a protracted war became major issues that divided Republicans <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> during Morton's tenure as governor.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Ford ran for {{lieutenant}} governor, {{this time}} against {{the wishes of}} Breathitt and Combs, whose pick was state attorney general Robert Matthews. Ford defeated Matthews by 631 votes, 0.2% of the total vote count in the primary. He ran an independent campaign and won {{in the general election}} even as Combs-Breathitt pick Henry Ward lost the race for governor to Republican Louie B. Nunn. Republicans <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> split the state offices, with five going to Republicans and four going to Democrats.|$|E

5|$|As 91 {{votes are}} needed to elect the Governor from the 180-member body <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> and Progressives held 112 seats, it was {{considered}} unlikely that Milne would win. Milne argued that legislators should decide the election in line with how their individual districts voted. Neal Goswami of the Vermont Press Bureau calculated that if each legislator voted according to the results in their district, the vote {{would result in a}} 90–90 tie. Milne disagreed with this calculation and claimed voting according to district outcome would result in his winning 93–87.|$|E
5|$|Enunciation of the Truman Doctrine {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a US bipartisan defense and foreign policy consensus between Republicans <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> focused on containment and deterrence that weakened during and after the Vietnam War, but ultimately persisted thereafter. Moderate and conservative parties in Europe, as well as social democrats, gave virtually unconditional support to the Western alliance, while European and American Communists, financed by the KGB and involved in its intelligence operations, adhered to Moscow's line, although dissent began to appear after 1956. Other critiques of the consensus policy came from anti-Vietnam War activists, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the anti-nuclear movement.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Territory of Hawaii in 1900, White {{became a member of the}} Home Rule Party, which was formed by the former leaders of Hui Aloha ʻĀina and Hui Kālaiʻāina. The party consisted of Native Hawaiians who had been leaders during the monarchy and other former royalists and loyalists such as Robert William Wilcox, who was elected the first congressional delegate from Hawaii under the Home Rule ticket. During this period, the party would share the political stage and contend with the Republicans <b>and</b> <b>Democrats.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hindman joined Confederate {{refugees}} in the Mexican town of Carlota, where he engaged in coffee planting and attempted to practice law. By April 1867, he was confident enough in the situation at home to return to Arkansas and apply to President Andrew Johnson for a pardon. Hindman's application {{was one of the}} few denied; nonetheless, he attempted to return to his former life. Politics still called to him and, although ineligible to run for office, he came out against the Reconstruction Constitution, which put him in direct conflict with reconstruction authorities. These authorities revived a treason indictment against him and had him arrested. This did not stop Hindman, who went on the political circuit and had some success building an unlikely coalition of newly freed slaves <b>and</b> <b>Democrats.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nixon won the Republican {{primary and}} Douglas the Democratic contest, with each also {{finishing}} {{third in the}} other party's contest (Boddy finished second in both races). The contentious Democratic race left the party divided, <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> were slow to rally to Douglas—some even endorsed Nixon. The Korean War broke out only days after the primaries, and both Nixon and Douglas contended that the other had often voted with Marcantonio {{to the detriment of}} national security. Nixon's attacks were far more effective, and he won the November 7 general election by almost 20percentage points, carrying 53 of California's 58counties and all metropolitan areas.|$|E

5|$|The {{war effort}} {{was the source}} of {{continued}} disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions {{on both sides of the}} aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|A popular Congressman {{and former}} Army officer, Hayes was {{considered}} by Ohio Republicans {{to be an}} excellent standard-bearer for the 1867 election campaign. Hayes's political views were more moderate than the Republican party's platform, although he agreed with the proposed amendment to the Ohio state constitution that would guarantee suffrage to black male Ohioans. Hayes's opponent, Allen G. Thurman, made the proposed amendment {{the centerpiece of the}} campaign and opposed black suffrage. Both men campaigned vigorously, making speeches across the state, mostly focusing on the suffrage question. The election was mostly a disappointment to Republicans, as the amendment failed to pass <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> gained a majority in the state legislature. Hayes thought at first that he, too, had lost, but the final tally showed that he had won the election by 2,983 votes of 484,603 votes cast.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} the election, Clay resigned, but Crittenden now {{declined}} the appointment to fill his unexpired term. Instead, the legislature elected Dixon to the remainder of Clay's term, set to expire in March 1855. Three weeks before Clay's death in 1852, he sent for Crittenden, and the two were reconciled; Critteden delivered a eulogy for Clay in September 1852, publicly dispelling the feud. After Clay's death, Crittenden became the most prominent Whig leader in Kentucky. He encouraged the party to support the nomination of Millard Fillmore for the presidency in 1852, but the nomination ultimately went to Winfield Scott. Crittenden was proposed as the nominee for vice-president, but he declined. Democrat Franklin Pierce carried the state by 2,700 votes {{in the general election}} <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> also captured the governorship that year; both were harbingers of the demise of the Whig Party in Kentucky.|$|E
