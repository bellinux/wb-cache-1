5|$|Feminist {{jurisprudence}} signifies {{a reaction}} to the philosophical approach of modern legal scholars, who typically see law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a society's universal, gender-neutral ideals. Feminist legal scholars claim that this fails to acknowledge women's values or legal interests or the harms that they may <b>anticipate</b> or experience.|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} explores {{the relationship between}} <b>anticipated</b> emotions and pro-environmental decision making comparing two differently valenced emotions: <b>anticipated</b> pride and guilt. In an experimental design, we examined the causal effects of <b>anticipated</b> pride versus guilt on pro-environmental decision making and behavioral intentions by making <b>anticipated</b> emotions (i. e. pride and guilt) salient just prior to asking participants to make a series of environmental decisions. We find evidence that <b>anticipating</b> one's positive future emotional state from green action just prior to making an environmental decision leads to higher pro-environmental behavioral intentions compared to <b>anticipating</b> one's negative emotional state from inaction. This finding suggests a rethinking {{in the domain of}} environmental and climate change messaging, which has traditionally favored inducing negative emotions such as guilt to promote pro-environmental action. Furthermore, exploratory results comparing <b>anticipated</b> pride and guilt inductions to baseline behavior point toward a reactance eliciting effect of <b>anticipated</b> guilt...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method of {{distinguishing}} between the effect of <b>anticipated</b> and unanticipated changes in oil prices and oil inventories on the US gasoline prices. I show that gasoline price adjustments are faster and stronger for <b>anticipated</b> changes in oil prices and inventory levels than for unanticipated changes. The dynamics of the gasoline price response depends on {{the relative importance of}} <b>anticipated</b> and unanticipated changes in oil prices and oil inventories in the model. In all versions of the adjustment model, the response of gasoline prices to unanticipated oil price changes is lagged and incomplete. In versions of the model where <b>anticipated</b> oil price changes are relatively important, the response of gasoline prices to <b>anticipated</b> changes in oil prices is immediate and large. As <b>anticipated</b> oil price changes become less important, the response of gasoline prices to <b>anticipated</b> oil price changes becomes muted and delayed. gasoline price response, <b>anticipated</b> price changes, oil inventory...|$|R

Part 1 (N = 145) of a two-part {{study was conducted to}} examine the relationship between self-stigma and the <b>anticipated</b> outcomes (risks and benefits) associated with seeking counseling on attitudes toward counseling among those currently experiencing or at risk for an eating disorder. The results of multiple hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that self-stigma, <b>anticipated</b> risks, and <b>anticipated</b> benefits significantly predicted attitudes towards seeking help for people with disordered eating. In addition, self-stigma had a stronger relationship with men 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes towards seeking help than women 2 ̆ 7 s and <b>anticipated</b> benefits had a stronger relationship with women 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes than men 2 ̆ 7 s. Part 2 (N = 676) used a pretest posttest experimental design to measure the effects of an educational intervention hypothesized to improve attitudes, increase the <b>anticipated</b> benefits and lessen the self-stigma, public stigma, and the <b>anticipated</b> risks associated with seeking counseling for an eating disorder.

Instead, his reading of the game helps him <b>anticipate</b> any attacking threats from the opposition team, {{most of the time}} by covering space and making interceptions. His distribution of the ball, creativity, and range of passing, which are among the best in comparison to other midfielders in Europe, add to his importance in dictating the tempo of the game, as well as initiating team attacks.|$|E

40|$|Although prior {{pedagogy}} {{research indicates}} {{significant relationships between}} several student characteristics and cheating intentions, no research has examined the simulta-neous effect of cognition and <b>anticipated</b> emotions on such intentions. To explore the possibility that imagined outcomes—prompted by <b>anticipated</b> emotions—and select cognitive factors antecede cheating intentions, the authors developed and tested a model that relates <b>anticipated</b> regret, <b>anticipated</b> elation, locus of control, and personal expertise to willingness to cheat. The empirical results, which rely on five extant scales and a new multiitem vignette measure of cheating intentions, validate this dual-process model. Also, {{the results show that}} <b>anticipated</b> elation is a source of value for students, which positively affects their willingness to cheat...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{theories}} about the relation between emotion and behavior hold that social behavior is influenced {{not only by the}} experience of emotion, but also by the anticipation of emotion. We argue that <b>anticipating</b> future emotional states is an emotion regulation strategy when it leads to a change in behavior. In the current studies we examined how construal of a fair or an unfair situation in terms of positive or negative <b>anticipated</b> emotions influences the fairness of subsequent behavior. We used the Ultimatum Bargaining Game – an experimental game in which participants divide a resource between themselves and another person – as a social situation that offers the opportunity to engage in fair and unfair behavior. In Study 1 we used an autobiographical recall task to manipulate <b>anticipated</b> emotions. Although the task did not influence <b>anticipated</b> emotions directly, results showed that <b>anticipated</b> pride about fair behavior increased levels of fairness, whereas <b>anticipated</b> pride about unfair behavior decreased levels of fairness. Similarly, <b>anticipated</b> regret about fair behavior decreased levels of fairness, whereas <b>anticipated</b> regret about unfair behavior increased levels of fairness. In Study 2 we replicated this pattern of findings, and found that participants who thought about their <b>anticipated</b> emotions (pride or regret) in relation to unfair behavior behaved more fairly. We discuss these findings in relation to theories of emotion regulation and economic decision-making...|$|R

5|$|After Cold Harbor, Lee and the Confederate {{high command}} {{were unable to}} <b>anticipate</b> Grant's next move, but Beauregard's {{strategic}} sense allowed {{him to make a}} prophetic prediction: Grant would cross the James River and attempt to seize Petersburg, which was lightly defended, but contained critical rail junctions supporting Richmond and Lee. Despite persistent pleas to reinforce this sector, Beauregard could not convince his colleagues of the danger. On June 15, his weak 5,400-man force—including boys, old men, and patients from military hospitals—resisted an assault by 16,000 Federals, known as the Second Battle of Petersburg. He gambled by withdrawing his Bermuda Hundred defenses to reinforce the city, assuming correctly that Butler would not capitalize on the opening. His gamble succeeded, and he held Petersburg long enough for Lee's army to arrive. It was arguably his finest combat performance of the war.|$|E
