5|$|A seventeen-year-old girl, Lisa Donovan (Alice Kremelberg), is {{declared}} brain dead at {{a hospital}} and is pulled off life support. While the doctors remove her organs for donation, she suddenly comes {{back from the dead}} and yells highly classified naval missile codes. Fringe Division arrives to investigate, along with a naval officer; he tells them the codes <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> a missing sailor called Andrew Rusk (Chazz Menendez). Lisa is unaware of the numbers or Rusk, but suddenly starts speaking Russian while Olivia (Anna Torv), Peter (Joshua Jackson), and Walter (John Noble) question her. The naval officer informs them that Rusk is fluent in the language.|$|E
5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb is {{the only}} known {{exoplanet}} in the orbit of host star MOA-2009-BLG-387L. The planet {{is estimated to be}} 2.6 times the mass of Jupiter. However, because knowledge of the exact parameters of the planet <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> the host star's parameters, and the host star's parameters are not well-constrained, uncertainty places MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb's mass between 1.0 and 6.7 times that of Jupiter. The planet is estimated to orbit its host star every 1970 days at a distance of 1.8 AU, some 1.8 times the mean distance between Earth and the Sun. Uncertainty broadens the mean distance to between 1.1 and 2.7 AU.|$|E
5|$|Naming {{groups of}} organisms {{in a way}} that is clear and widely agreed is important, as some {{disputes}} in paleontology have been based just on misunderstandings over names. Linnaean taxonomy is commonly used for classifying living organisms, but runs into difficulties when dealing with newly discovered organisms that are significantly different from known ones. For example: it is hard to decide at what level to place a new higher-level grouping, e.g. genus or family or order; this is important since the Linnaean rules for naming groups <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> their levels, and hence if a group is moved to a different level it must be renamed.|$|E
5000|$|Degree-based CPT <b>is</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> {{the degree}} {{but not to}} a {{specific}} course. Course-based CPT <b>is</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> a specific course, and can be taken only by students enrolled in that course.|$|R
50|$|The blast {{may have}} <b>been</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> the {{fighting}} in the north, or it may have <b>been</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> the series of bombings and assassinations of anti-Syrian figures going back to Rafiq Hariri's killing.|$|R
50|$|At the barracks, {{one person}} would <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> a fixture with a rope, {{while the other}} would <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> another with an elastic. The second team member had to fight the elastic to hand over a flag to their partner.|$|R
5|$|Saint Paul's {{history and}} growth as a landing port <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> water. The city's {{defining}} physical characteristic, {{the confluence of}} the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers, was carved into the region during the last ice age, as were the steep river bluffs and dramatic palisades on which the city is built. Receding glaciers and Lake Agassiz forced torrents of water from a glacial river that undercut the river valleys. The city is situated in east-central Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|The Penguin Jazz Guide {{commented that}} Hope's {{compositions}} were strongly melodic, with some containing concepts of fugue and canon taken from classical music, but retaining foundations in the blues. Atkins stated that Hope wrote highly structured, complex compositions that {{he played with}} improvisational flexibility. Mathieson pointed out that, despite the originality of Hope's compositions, they have been taken up by other musicians only rarely, as they <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> Hope's idiosyncratic form of expression and remain difficult to play.|$|E
5|$|The {{history and}} {{economic}} growth of Minneapolis <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> water, the city's defining physical characteristic, which {{was brought to the}} region during the last ice age ten thousand years ago. Ice blocks deposited in valleys by retreating glaciers created the lakes of Minneapolis. Fed by a receding glacier and Lake Agassiz, torrents of water from a glacial river cut the Mississippi riverbed and created the river's only waterfall, Saint Anthony Falls, important to the early settlers of Minneapolis.|$|E
50|$|In {{these early}} days, {{the price for}} calling 0845 numbers from landlines <b>was</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> BT's price for calls to local {{geographic}} numbers. Similarly, the price for calling 0870 numbers from landlines <b>was</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> BT's price for national calls to geographic numbers.|$|R
5000|$|The idea {{of having}} two, totally {{opposite}} genders <b>is</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> sexuality through what gender theorist Judith Butler calls a [...] "compulsory practice of heterosexuality". Because oppositional sexism <b>is</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> heteronormativity in this way, non-heterosexuals are seen as breaking gender norms.|$|R
50|$|Its economy <b>is</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> {{farming and}} forestry.|$|R
5|$|Amon {{was the son}} of King Manasseh of Judah and Meshullemeth, a {{daughter}} of Haruz of Jotbah. Although the date is unknown, the Hebrew Bible records that he married Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath. Amon began his reign of Judah at the age of 22, and reigned for two years. Biblical scholar and archeologist William F. Albright has dated his reign to 642 – 640, while professor E. R. Thiele offers the dates 643/642– 641/640. Thiele's dates <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> the reign of Amon's son Josiah, whose death at the hands of Pharaoh Necho II occurred in the summer of 609. Josiah's death, which is independently confirmed in Egyptian history, places the end of Amon's reign, 31 years earlier, in 641 or 640 and the beginning of his rule in 643 or 642.|$|E
5|$|Henry begins time {{traveling}} {{at the age}} of five, jumping forward and backward relative to his own timeline. When he leaves, where he goes, or how long his trips will last are all beyond his control. His destinations <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> his subconscious—he most often travels to places and times related to his own history. Certain stimuli such as stress can trigger Henry's time traveling; he often goes jogging to keep calm and remain in the present. He searches out pharmaceuticals in the future that may be able to help control his time traveling. He also seeks the advice of a geneticist, Dr. Kendrick. Henry cannot take anything with him into the future or the past; he always arrives naked and then struggles to find clothing, shelter, and food. He amasses a number of survival skills including lock-picking, self-defense, and pickpocketing. Much of this he learns from older versions of himself.|$|E
5|$|Several {{women in}} Carnivàle <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> Avatars, {{but only two}} have Avataric blood: Belyakov's {{daughter}} Iris is a Vectorus by definition, and Justin's daughter Sofie is the Omega. Although Sofie is {{two years older than}} Ben, her father's Avataric generation places her in the next Avataric generation. The other affected women are human mothers who began to suffer from mental illness or strange behavior after giving birth to an Avatar. Ben's mother Flora was a religious fanatic who would not touch her son. Scudder's mother Emma cut her eyes out and killed several of her family members the night Scudder was born. Sofie's mother Apollonia became catatonic after Sofie's birth. Justin's and his older sister Iris's mother receives no special mention in the series, but the Pitch Document mentions her chronic paranoid schizophrenia after Justin's birth. As far as known, none of these mothers became pregnant after giving birth to an Avatar.|$|E

5|$|The Festivals are Nativity, Epiphany, the Baptism of our Lord, the Transfiguration, the Annunciation, Palm Sunday, Easter, the Ascension, Pentecost, Holy Trinity, All Saints, and Christ the King. Most {{of these}} festivals <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> the {{moveable}} feast of Easter. Festivals {{take precedence over}} all other days, including Sundays, have their own collects and Eucharistic proper prefaces. Of the festivals, Christmas {{is considered to be}} twelve days in length (from December 25 until January 5) and Easter is fifty days in length (from Easter Sunday up to and inclusive of Pentecost). For Easter, Sundays are considered to be another part of the festival. For the Ascension which, falling on fortieth day of Easter, will always be on a Thursday, the festival is sometimes transferred to the Seventh Sunday of Easter in addition to or in place of the normal part of the Easter festival for that day.|$|E
5|$|The Sands the Prince {{collects}} from {{enemies and}} the environment <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> his magical abilities, themselves connected with the Dagger. The most basic power is Rewind, the ability for the Prince to rewind time by up to ten seconds if he makes a mistake in platforming or dies. In combat, the Prince can also slow time immediately around him, freeze time for a single enemy, and freeze time completely so the Prince can attack his enemies at great speed while {{they are unable to}} move. Each use of power uses up one Sand Tank, and when empty, all powers become inaccessible until more Sand is collected. More powerful abilities, such as freezing time, are powered by Power Tanks. Increasing their number unlocks new Sand-based powers. Starting out {{with a small amount of}} Sand available to him, its capacity can be increased by collecting Sand from enemies, along with Sand Clouds scattered around the palace. Large columns of Sand within the Palace grant visions of future areas and act as save points.|$|E
25|$|Tegucigalpa's {{economic}} challenges <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> {{those of}} the rest of the country, such as overcoming crime, anomalies in the judicial system, educational backwardness, and deficient infrastructure in order to continue to encourage foreign investors and permit growth of local entrepreneurs.|$|E

25|$|Some methods <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> a {{particular}} company or school, {{and are not}} used in mainstream teaching. Besides those mentioned below, {{there are dozens of}} competitors, each slightly different. Notable are the computer courses which use speech recognition to give feedback on pronunciation.|$|E
25|$|Some groups <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> song structures, such as Sonic Youth. Although {{they are}} not {{representative}} of the entire genre, they helped popularize noise rock among alternative rock audiences by incorporating melodies into their droning textures of sound, which set a template that numerous other groups followed.|$|E
25|$|Generally, the association's {{activities}} <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> {{the purpose}} above, {{in particular the}} development of a popular entity called the University of Knowledge of the Elderly (UNISAVIE: Université du savoir des vieux), and the initiation of a movement to promote other living places that are organized into similar networks.|$|E

25|$|Pointe {{shoes are}} {{designed}} for ballet dancing. These have a toe box that is stiffened with glue and a hardened sole so the dancer can stand on the tips of their toes. They are secured by elastic straps and ribbons that <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> the dancer's ankles.|$|E
25|$|Convergent {{thinking}} {{is a fundamental}} tool in a child's education. Today, most educational opportunities <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> one's performance on standardized tests that are often multiple choice in nature. When a student contemplates the possible answers available, they use convergent thinking to weigh alternatives within a construct. This allows one to find a single best solution that is measurable.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{gustatory}} {{disorders are}} challenging to diagnose and evaluate. Because gustatory functions <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> {{the sense of}} smell, the somatosensory system, {{and the perception of}} pain (such as in tasting spicy foods), it is difficult to examine sensations mediated through an individual system. In addition, gustatory dysfunction is rare when compared to olfactory disorders.|$|E
