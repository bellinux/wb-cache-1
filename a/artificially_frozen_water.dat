40|$|This paper {{describes}} a molecular dynamics and molecular mechanics {{study of the}} solvation and selectivity of the narrow pore and vestibule region of a model-built structure for the voltage-gated sodium channel. The particular structure used was one proposed by Guy and Durell. However, many of the features we saw would likely be shared with other possible models for this channel, {{such as the one}} proposed by Lipkind and Fozzard. It was found that the water mobility was reduced in the channel and the water orientations were significantly ordered by the channel environment. Water mobility depended on protein mobility; in a computer experiment in which the protein was <b>artificially</b> <b>frozen,</b> channel <b>water</b> at 300 degrees K was immobilized. Water motions were defined in significant part by a series of discrete moves from one pattern of hydrogen bonding with particular amino acids to another. However, {{there are so many different}} hydrogen bonding patterns that a description of the motion in terms of transitions among a small number of discrete states is not appropriate. In the model whose solvation we explored, several charged residues seem to play a particularly significant role in determining solvation and water motions. Based on energy minimization studies, the structure clearly shows selectivity for univalent cations over anions...|$|R

The flakes of <b>frozen</b> <b>water</b> remain {{in the press and}} only the sweet juice flows. This is the principle of ice wine. Cryoextraction is a recent technique invented to reproduce the phenomenon in the regions which are not cold enough: the grapes are <b>artificially</b> <b>frozen</b> before being pressed. This method overcomes the climate and harvesting work can continue without waiting for the frosts (risk of loss of the grapes by weather accident or attack by hungry sparrows), but shortening the maturation does not give the same flavour.|$|R

However since the field was <b>artificially</b> <b>frozen,</b> the opening season was much longer that with natural ice. The actual arena was constructed in 1973. This allowed teams to play indoors. The new arena with spectator capacity of 3,000 was inaugurated on November 2006.|$|R

50|$|Fractional {{freezing}} {{can be used}} to desalinate sea water. In {{a process}} that naturally occurs with sea ice, <b>frozen</b> salt <b>water,</b> when partially melted, leaves behind ice that is of a much lower salt content. Because sodium chloride lowers the melting point of water, the salt in sea water tends to be forced out of pure water while freezing. Likewise, the <b>frozen</b> <b>water</b> with the highest concentration of salt melts first. Either method decreases the salinity of the <b>frozen</b> <b>water</b> left over, and with multiple runs can be drinkable.|$|R

The thermal conductivity of the pulps was also investigated {{as a function of}} the <b>frozen</b> <b>water</b> fraction and temperature using a coaxial dual-cylinder apparatus. Above the initial {{freezing point}}, thermal conductivity fitted the polynomial equations well.
