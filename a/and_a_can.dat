25|$|Nominative–accusative {{alignment}} {{can also}} be distinguished through behavioral properties, {{in the way a}} nominative or accusative argument will behave when placed in particular syntactic constructions. This {{has to do with the}} impact of alignment on the level of the whole sentence rather than the individual word. Morphosyntactic alignment determines which arguments can be omitted in a coordinate structure during the process of conjunction reduction (deleting arguments from the ends of joined clauses). In nominative–accusative, only arguments S <b>and</b> <b>A</b> <b>can</b> be omitted and not argument O.|$|E

2500|$|On 17 August 1985, Reyat {{became a}} third suspect once the receipt for the tuner {{was found with}} his name.
