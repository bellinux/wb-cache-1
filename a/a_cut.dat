Likewise, the original Egyptian pigments were discarded in favor of Greek lead-based inks. The adoption of Greco-Roman writing tools influenced Egyptian handwriting, as hieratic signs became more spaced, had rounder flourishes, and greater angular precision.|$|E

5|$|One {{section of}} the M11 {{extension}} was due to tunnel under George Green in Wanstead.

5|$|A cutset in an {{arbitrary}} connected graph is {{a subset of}} edges defined from a partition of the vertices into two subsets, by including an edge in the subset when it has one endpoint {{on each side of}} the partition. Removing the edges of a cutset necessarily splits the graph into at least two connected components. A minimal cutset (also called a bond) is a cutset with the property that every proper subset of the cutset is not itself <b>a</b> <b>cut.</b> A minimal cutset of a connected graph necessarily separates its graph into exactly two components, and consists of the set of edges that have one endpoint in each component. A simple cycle is a connected subgraph in which each vertex of the cycle is incident to exactly two edges of the cycle.|$|E
5000|$|At least a {{score of}} decipherments have been claimed since then, none {{of which have been}} {{accepted}} by other rongorongo epigraphers. For instance, ethnographer Irina Fedorova published purported translations of the two St Petersburg tablets and portions of four others. More rigorous than most attempts, she restricts each glyph to a single logographic reading. However, the results make little sense as texts. For example, tablet P begins (with each rongorongo ligature marked by a comma in the translation): he <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> rangi sugarcane, a tara yam, he cut lots of taro, of stalks (?), he <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> yam, he harvested, he <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> yam, he <b>cut,</b> he pulled up, he <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> honui, he <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> sugarcane, he <b>cut,</b> he harvested, he took, a kihi, he chose a kihi, he took a kihi … Text P, recto, line 1 and continues in this vein to the end: he harvested a yam, a poporo, a calabash, he pulled up <b>a</b> yam, he <b>cut,</b> he cut one plant, he <b>cut</b> one plant, <b>a</b> yam, he <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> banana, he harvested <b>a</b> sugarcane, he <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> taro, he <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> kahu yam, a yam, a yam … Text P, verso, line 11 The other texts are similar. For example, the Mamari calendar makes no mention of time or the moon in Fedorova's account: a root, a root, a root, a root, a root, a root is, a lot of roots, a tuber, he took, he <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> potato tuber, he dug up yam shoots, a yam tuber, a potato tuber, a tuber … Text C, recto, line 7 which even Fedorova characterized as [...] "worthy of a maniac".|$|R

5|$|A further Bill in 1740 sought {{powers to}} improve the river from Barnby Dun to Fishlake Ferry. Despite serious opposition, which {{included}} the merchants and traders of Doncaster as well as Doncaster Corporation, the Bill was passed, giving the company new powers to make the river deeper and create <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> to avoid the shallows at Stainforth and Bramwith. Work on this northern section started almost immediately. The southern section to Tinsley was navigable by 1751, although the wharf and warehouse had not been completed by that date, and the towpath from Rotherham was not completed until 1822.|$|E
5|$|After Australia {{ended with}} 509 {{and took a}} 334-run lead, Tallon took two {{difficult}} catches to dismiss key batsmen {{at the start of}} England's second innings. Miller removed Cyril Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot to Tallon. Bill Edrich was then caught behind attempting <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> from the off spin of Johnson. He did not read the arm ball that went straight on and the ball took the outside edge, leaving England at 2/39. He thus helped Australia to seize the initiative by denying England a good start, but they recovered. Later, he caught Godfrey Evans for 50 from Johnson as England ended at 441. Australia reached their target of 98 with two wickets down, completing an eight-wicket victory. Tallon conceded five and 12 byes in the two innings respectively.|$|E
5|$|Although the snuff film {{allegations}} were disproven, the Italian courts decided to ban Cannibal Holocaust {{due to the}} genuine animal slayings, citing animal cruelty laws. Deodato, Franco Palaggi, Franco Di Nunzio, Gianfranco Clerici, producer Alda Pia and United Artists Europa representative Sandro Perotti each received a four-month suspended sentence after they were all convicted of obscenity and violence. Deodato fought in the courts for three additional years to get his film unbanned. In 1984, the courts {{ruled in favor of}} Deodato, and Cannibal Holocaust was granted a rating certificate of VM18 for <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> print. It would later be re-released uncut.|$|E
30|$|First we recall some notations. We denote by κ'(G) and δ(G) {{the edge}} {{connectivity}} and the minimum degree of a graph G, respectively. Let S be a nonempty proper subset of V. We use G[S] to denote the subgraph of G induced by S. The edge cut of G, denoted by ∂(S), is {{a subset of}} E(G) of the form [S,S̅], where S̅=V S. An edge cut ∂(v) (v∈ V) is called <b>a</b> trivial edge <b>cut.</b> <b>A</b> k-edge <b>cut</b> is <b>an</b> edge <b>cut</b> of k elements. Let G∈G_n,k. Then G must have <b>a</b> k-edge <b>cut</b> ∂(S) with 1 ≤|S| ≤n/ 2.|$|R

5|$|As the Market {{was being}} built, <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> and cover railway tunnel was {{constructed}} underground City street level {{to create a}} triangular junction with the railway between Blackfriars and Kings Cross through Snow Hill Tunnel — closed in 1916, it has been revived and is now used for Thameslink rail services. The construction of extensive railway sidings, beneath Smithfield Park, facilitated the transfer of animal carcases to its Cold Store, and directly up to the Meat Market via lifts. These sidings closed in the 1960s, and are now used as a car park, accessed via a cobbled descent at the centre of Smithfield Park. Today, much of the meat is delivered to market by road.|$|E
5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} collaborations with Bryan Singer on The Usual Suspects, Superman Returns and X2, editor and composer John Ottman edited the film without a temp track, noting if {{the film was}} working well without music, it was becoming a strong product. Since Valkyrie drew its inspirations from previous World War II films like The Great Escape (1963), Where Eagles Dare (1968), Patton (1970), and Midway (1976), filmmakers initially had <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> where title cards introduced characters and their roles. When the cut was test screened with an American audience, the title cards were removed due to complaints that {{there were too many}} characters to follow.|$|E
5|$|Capper {{oversaw the}} first Army aeroplanes. He briefly flew Dunne's first glider, the D.1, during secret trials at Blair Atholl in Scotland in 1907. The flight had {{lasted only a}} few seconds when the glider crashed into a wall, with Capper {{sustaining}} <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> to the head. The next year, Cody flew the first British-built aeroplane at Farnborough, which earned it the title British Army Aeroplane No.1. This was an ironic achievement for Capper's command, as he had pinned his personal hopes on Dunne, whose D.4 achieved {{no more than a few}} hops.|$|E
