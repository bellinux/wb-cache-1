40|$|Eligibility {{reform in}} the VA and the {{resulting}} increased caseloads have brought about unacceptable wait times for new audiology appointments. Mandates to decrease wait times without increased resources have brought new demands on audiology clinics. One proposed solution is the addition of audiology technicians to VA audiology clinic practice. The first {{purpose of this study}} was to survey the attitudes of VA audiologists and service chiefs regarding the use of technicians. The second purpose was to ask the survey respondents to assign as generally appropriate or inappropriate, job duties which might be accomplished by an <b>audiology</b> <b>technician.</b> Following a pre-survey to pilot the questionnaire, the final survey was e-mailed to all members of a national e-mail group. Ninety-three acceptable responses were analyzed. The survey responses indicate that a large majority of the respondents hold positive attitudes concerning the use of technicians, believe technicians can accomplish some duties now done by audiologists and believe technicians can help reduce current appointment backlogs. The respondents assigned a number of clerical, assistive, minor hearing aid repair and other duties as appropriate for technicians and many testing, evaluation, programming, and perceived professional duties as inappropriate for technicians. There were several items which were not clearly assigned as either appropriate or inappropriate technician duties. Open-ended responses indicated that strong feelings, both positive and negative, exist within the audiology and service chief community. The survey results will be used to develop an <b>audiology</b> <b>technician</b> job description and to identify specific training needs for establishing <b>audiology</b> <b>technician</b> positions throughout the VA healthcare system...|$|E
40|$|WORLD SERVICE PROJECTS QUOTA CLUB OF BA, FijI: 1989 - 1991 Project: H. A. R. T. (Housing Assistance Relief Trust) is an organi 2 ation that {{provides}} housing to the destitute. These are mainly deserted wives, widows, {{and others in}} similar situations. H. A. R. T. relies heavily on donations, yet it can only provide a roofand four walls-no furniture and only bare concrete Ooors. Objective: To sponsor families who cannot afford food or shelter. Project details: Ba has 24 units. The original units in Ba are wooden. One of them was occupied by Gauri, a deserted mother ofa six-year-old, with a bed-ridden blind mother to look after. Her unit is so unfit to live in­ronen Ooor and falling room partitions-that the H. A. R. T. committee has shifted her to a safer unit. wt year we provided her with groceries {{so that she could}} stay home and look after her invalid mother, and paid her daughter's kindergarten fees, while we waited to receive help from our Quotarian sisters to repair her unit. Late last year her mother died, so Gauri can work fuU time now, but her unit is still uninhabitable. Financial requirements: H. A. R. T. relies on donations only. It does not receiYe government subsidy. H. A. R. T. tenants are expected to pay a 110 deposit, S 2 a month for rent, and 11 a month for electricity. Most cannot pay this, but are not evicted. Consequently, we need U. S. l 1, 500 to 12, 000 to complete this project.

Background: 'The Quota Club of Madras, India, had the largest membership among the Indian Quota clubs, with more than 23 dedicated members. We would like to appeal to our fellow members all over the world for support ofone ofour Shaner Silence projects as their dul>to-club project. We have {{for the past four years}} been inroived with and provided much financial support for the Mary ClubwallaJadhav School for the Deaf (children) in our city. One ofour current projects for the school is an annual sports meet for the children. Through this event, they experience a sense ofparticipation and involvement in extracurricular activities. 1 bedub purchases the prizes and pays for expenses incurred. Other projects to benefit the school include an annual academic best outgOing student prize and cash donations toward soundproofing the dassrooms. Our members have made other small personal contribu­tions. Objective: Mary Clubwalla Jadhav is a unique school in that admission is not based on age ofentry, but on degree of deafness with regards to educability, hence proriding an opportunity for those children in whom the hearing handicap is partial, but detected later. 1 Financial requirements: The school authorities have proposed expansion ofthe school premises and the Quota Club of Madras has already donated 10, 000 rupees (U. S. S 6 OO) t -atd the construction of the first floor. We would like to contribute more toward this goal since the school is an ongoing project for our club. Therefore. we. the Quota Club of Madras, India, are putting forth a v [...] orldv. -ide appeal for suppon for our project. Club contact: Ms. Zainab Kanchwalla C/o Guild ofService (Central) 28. Casa Major Road Egmore, Madras· 600 008 India QUOTA CLUB OF NEW DELHI, INDIA: 1989 · 1991 _______ Project: To build a home for the abandoned and destitute Io'Omen of Delhi. Project details: The project consists ofbuilding eight units each consisting of 10 family rooms that will allow a mother and her children to live comfortably as human beings. The length ofsay in the home will be between 12 and 24 months or until the woman is trained in a useful and productive occupation that will provide for her family needs and give her the opportunity to adjust to her new Status as a wonhwhile woman and not a slave in a patriarchal society. Once the woman is able to earn she will contribute to the family's living expenses and education. The Delhi Quotarians are committed to the building ofone of these homes to be called the Quota House. Once finished, it will be managed and financed by a women's organization, headed by Mrs. Tara Ali Baig, chief administrator ofwomen's affairs in Delhi and chiefadministrator ofS. O. S. villages in India. Background: The traditional role ofan Indian woman (the indoctrination begins in the cradle) is that she exists as a vassal ofman. She is the servant ofhis family, compelled by tradition to accept whatever treatment is meted out. Her whole life from the day of her marriage (often as a child) is set on a course ofserfdom. If her marriage fails, she has nowhere to go. The only escape for these abandoned and destitute creatures in the past has been suicide by immolation or the brothels. The Quota Oub ofNew Delhi recognizes this terrible problem and its members have vowed to establish a refuge for these unwanted women. Project location: Faridabab. a township on the outskirts ofDelhi. Progress and financial requirements: The Quota Club ofNew Delhi has held functions annually to raise funds for this home. We also have received donations from many Quota clubs around the wodd. The amount received so far is more than Rs. 288, 000 rupees (U. S. 18. S(0). These funds are in a beddeposit for which we receive interest. How­ever, we need an additional Rs. one million rupees (L. S. 61, 000) to complete our project.

Purpose oftbe project: This project is a very concrete way ofshowing and practicing Quota's motto, "We Share," since the day­care centre takes care ofthree-to six. year-old preschoolers who are otherwise left neglected by their financially deprived parents. This setĆS as a venue ofhelping the children to be better prepared for formal schooling by age seven. It is also a forum for early education and values orientation. Parents benefit from the project because it relieves them ofsomeoftheir home responsibilities. The community enjoys an improved standard ofliving as a result ofthe project's informational and educa­tional aspects. Objectives: 1. Aclose follow-up on the information and educational curriculum. 2. Health and medical follow-ups in the form ofdeworming and regular medical checks by the committee chairman and other invited medical personnel. 3. Formation ofa parents' group to encourage self-help activities. 4. Maintenance of the centre's facilities (tables and chairs) as well as the provision ofother essential equipment and teaching materials. 5. Provision of monthly stipend to the day-care worker. 6. Provision ofeducational seminars such as classes for mothers, sanitation classes, etc. 7. Support of the feeding program for the mild and moderately malnourished children of the centre. 8.

Objectives: 1. To provide for higher education of the elementary school graduates ofthe SPED School for Exceptional Children who are hearing and speech impaired. Secondary or high school education will better prepare these handicapped children for their adult role in society-that ofbecoming productive dtizens ofthe country. 2. To better equip these individuals with skills needed to get jobs in the near future. 3. To instill in the minds ofthese adolescents proper values and attitudes despite their handicap. 4. To provide further education for deafindividuals who are intellectuallyendowed, and who would benefit from further (college) education in the future.. QUOTA CLUB OF COLOMBO, SRI LANKA: 1989 · 1991 [...] ­Project: Deafscreening and assessment centre. Background: Since Sri Lanka is a country ofgreat poveny and illiteracy, the incidence ofdeafness is greater and the ability to overcome is less. Deafness does not evoke a sympathetic response at first Sight and eë 1 l physi­cians do not consider deafness as serious as other handicaps. This results in a double disability of lost hearing and speech and a resulting communication gap. Unlike blindness, the disabling aspect of deafness can be overcome ifproper steps are taken. We would like to initiate a deafscreening center in Sri Lanka. Objectives: 1. To prevent abnormal development in children due to deafness and dumbness at an early age and to promote optimal child health-physical, mental, and emotional-thus enabling Céry child to develop his or her full potential and overcome the disability. 2. To encourage deafness awareness in parents, interested persons. and agencies concerned with child care and development. 3. To make immunization facilities that prevent deafness related diseases available to all. 4. To benefit pregnant mothets and children ofboth sexes from birth to 19 yeats ofage. i. rrespccth-e ofnationality.

40|$|A {{decision}} support system (DSS) is used for analysing a situation and making decisions. The goal {{of this research is}} to mine a large set of heterogeneous audiology data and create a DSS to help <b>audiology</b> <b>technicians</b> to choose between an ITE or BTE hearing aid. Although, in many cases such a choice is clear cut, but at other times this system {{could be used as a}} second opinion to predict the hearing aid type. A number of data mining techniques, such as clustering of audiograms, association analysis of variables (such as, age, gender, diagnosis, masker, mould and free text keywords) using contingency tables and principal component analysis on audiograms were used to find candidate variables to be combined into a DSS. The DSS was created using the techniques of logistic regression, Naïve Bayesian analysis and Bayesian networks, and these systems were tested and validated on test data to see which of the techniques produced the better results. This DSS takes air and bone conduction frequencies, age, gender, diagnosis, masker, mould and some free text words associated with a patient as input and gives as the output a decision as to whether the patient would be more likely to prefer an ITE or a BTE hearing aid type. The highest agreement between predicted results and actual hearing aid type in the data were obtained using Bayesian networks, with 93 to 94 percent similarity overall, with a precision of 0. 91 for ITE and 0. 96 for BTE. The reason for this might be that the Bayesian network also considers interaction between variables while the other two techniques (logistic regression and Naïve Bayesian analysis) consider only the individual variables. One of the important features of this DSS is that once the final choice of hearing aid type is predicted, the decision process can be tracked back to see which factors (variables) contributed how much to the final decision. The theoretical upper bound of classifier performance is the inter-annotator agreement (Altman, 1991), in this case the rate at which two expert audiologists would assign the same hearing aid to the same patient. Unfortunately, this type of data was not included in the audiology database...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the data mining {{of a large}} set of patient records from the hearing aid clinic at James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough, UK. As typical of medical data in general, these audiology records are heterogeneous, containing the following three different types of data: Audiograms (graphs of hearing ability at different frequencies) Structured tabular data (such as gender, date of birth and diagnosis) Unstructured text (specific observations made about each patient in a free- text or comment field) This audiology data set is unique, as it contains records of patients prescribed with both ITE and BTE hearing aids. ITE hearing aids are not generally available on the British National Health Service in England, as they are more expensive than BTE hearing aids. However, both types of aids are prescribed at James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough, UK, which {{is also an important}} feature of this data. There are two research questions for this research: Which factors influence the choice of ITE (in the ear) as opposed to BTE (behind the ear) hearing aids? For patients diagnosed with tinnitus (ringing in the ear), which factors influence the decision whether to fit a tinnitus masker (a gentle sound source, worn like a hearing aid, designed to drown out tinnitus) ? A number of data mining techniques, such as clustering of audiograms, association analysis of variables (such as, age, gender, diagnosis, masker, mould and free text keywords) using contingency tables and principal component analysis on audiograms were used to find candidate variables to be combined into a decision support system (OSS) where unseen patient records are presented to the system, and the relative likelihood that a patient should be fitted with an ITE as opposed to a BTE aid or a tinnitus with masker as opposed to tinnitus not with masker is returned. The DSS was created using the techniques of logistic regression, Nalve Bayesian analysis and Bayesian network, and these systems were tested using 5 fold cross validations to see which of the techniques produced the better results. The advantage of these techniques for the combination of evidence is that {{it is easy to see}} which variables contributed to the final d~~Jpion. The constructed models and the data behind them were validated by"presenting them to the Principal audiologist, Dr. Robertshaw at James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough for comments and suggestions for improvements. The techniques developed in this thesis for the construction of prediction models were also used successfully on a different audiology data set from Malaysia. These decisions are typically made by <b>audiology</b> <b>technicians</b> working in the out- patient clinics, on the basis of audiogram results and in consultation with the patients. In many cases, the choice is clear cut, but at other times the technicians might benefit from a second opinion given by an automatic system with an explanation of how that second opinion was arrived at.

40|$|Poster Session II - Panel 4 For {{over fifty}} years {{audiology}} has advanced as a clinical specialty {{in the developed}} world. Over recent {{years there has been}} a rapid growth in the numbers of audiologists and in the sophistication of audiology assessment techniques and rehabilitation procedures. In developed economies most individuals with hearing impairment now have access to appropriate screening programs, audiological diagnostic assessment, hearing aid fitting and support for their rehabilitation needs. In developing countries however this is not the case. Many children still have undetected hearing loss; many adults with hearing disorders struggle to fulfill their social and economic roles without the benefits that appropriate amplification could bring. At least two-thirds of the 278 million adults and children with significant hearing loss live in nations with less developed economies. Living in such countries, professional help may be scarce and often distant, and assessment equipment and hearing aids or other amplification devices, unaffordable for most of the community. For example, it is estimated that only one million hearing aids are fitted in developing countries each year, when the actual need is for thirty million. There are many concerned individuals and organizations in both developed and developing countries who are now working to change this situation. Increasing attention is being paid to hearing loss in developing countries by international agencies, and professional organizations in the developed world now regularly acknowledge the humanitarian work of their members with awards and grants. Governments, private agencies and individuals in developing nations have commenced programs to detect hearing loss and initiatives to promote affordable hearing devices are now ongoing. At the same time, more <b>audiology</b> professionals and <b>technicians</b> are working in developing countries. An international charitable agency, World Wide Hearing Care for Developing Countries (WWHearing), has emerged as a leading contributor to these initiatives. WWHearing is an initiative founded in 2003 by members of concerned organizations and individuals. In 2006 WWHearing became a charitable association in Switzerland and signed a project collaboration agreement with the World Health Organization. Its mission is to promote and enable better hearing worldwide through the provision of affordable hearing aids and services, especially in under-served areas. In particular, WWHearing aims to (1) build partnerships and networks among those providing hearing health care in developing countries, (2) provide support for hearing health advocacy and national capacity building, (3) coordinate research projects appropriate to a developing country context and disseminate the findings of such research and (4) establish a permanent organizational and administrative structure. To further these aims WWHearing has developed the AUDIO 20 / 20 initiative—which aims to make prevention, research, education, equipment, training, and advocacy related to hearing loss priorities throughout the developing world. This presentation will give a broad overview of WWHearing’s present and planned contributions hearing health care in developing nations. The aim of the presentation is to give professionals a greater awareness of the issues involved in hearing health care as it relates to developing nations and the key role played by WWHearing. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 30 th International Congress of Audiology (ICA-EIA 2010), São Paulo, Brasi, 28 March- 1 April 2010.
