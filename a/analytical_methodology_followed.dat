40|$|The {{status of}} any section of {{population}} {{in a society}} is intimately connected with its economic position. The development strategy which neglects the need for enhancing {{the role of women}} cannot lead to comprehensive socio – economic development. Globalisation has introduced enormous economic opportunities for women, but they are associated with mounting threats. The research paper intends to comprehend and give an an overview on the impact of globalisation in current scenario on women‘s employment in India with special focus on Tamilnadu. The objective of the study is to highlight the Gender gap and Gender divide through the sectoral participation of women. <b>Analytical</b> <b>methodology</b> is <b>followed</b> to give a critical note on the contribution of women in the socio-economic transformation of the state. Besides, both qualitative and quantitative analysis on the economic contribution of women is adopted in this study to analyse the implications of Globalisation...|$|R
40|$|A new polar {{monolith}} {{based on}} poly(poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate-co-pentaerythritol triacrylate) (poly(PEGMA-co-PETRA)) was first synthesised, after the optimisation of the polymerisation conditions, and applied as a coating for the stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) {{of a group}} of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from environmental water samples. Several parameters affecting extraction and liquid desorption in SBSE were investigated to achieve the optimal sorption efficiencies for the studied analytes. Under the optimised experimental conditions, a rapid, simple and sensitive SBSE performance was provided by the in-house monolithic stir bar. Moreover, the in-house coating was able to extract and desorb most of the studied analytes more effectively and quickly, due to its polar behaviour and suitable mechanical and physical properties, in comparison with the recently commercialised polar stir bars (EG Silicone Twister® and Acrylate Twister®). The <b>analytical</b> <b>methodology,</b> including SBSE <b>followed</b> by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), was validated and successfully applied for the determination {{of a group of}} PPCPs in wastewater samples...|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{degradation}} is {{the most}} important process to remove organic pollutants in Waste Water Treatment Plants. Regarding chiral compounds this process is normally enantioselective and needs the suitable <b>analytical</b> <b>methodology</b> to <b>follow</b> the removal of both enantiomers in an accurate way. Thus, this paper describes the development and validation of an enantioselective High Performance Liquid Chromatography with Fluorescence Detection (HPLC-FD) method for simultaneous analysis of fluoxetine (FLX) and norfluoxetine (NFLX) in wastewater effluents. Briefly, this method preconcentrated a small volume of wastewater samples (50 mL) on 500 mg Oasis MCX cartridges and used HPLC-FD with a vancomycin-based chiral stationary phase under reversed mode for analyses. The optimized mobile phase was EtOH/aqueous ammonium acetate buffer (92. 5 / 7. 5, v/v) at pH 6. 8. The effect of EtOH percentage, buffer concentration, pH, column oven temperature and flow rate on chromatographic parameters was systematically investigated. The developed method was validated within the wastewater effluent used in microcosms laboratory assays. Linearity (R 2 > 0. 99), selectivity and sensitivity were achieved in the range of 4. 0 – 60 ng mL 1 for enantiomers of FLX and 2. 0 – 30 ng mL 1 for enantiomers of NFLX. The limits of detection were between 0. 8 and 2. 0 ng mL 1 and the limits of quantification were between 2. 0 and 4. 0 ng mL 1 for both enantiomers of FLX and the enantiomers of its demethylated metabolite NFLX. The validated method was successfully applied and proved to be robust to follow the degradation of both enantiomers of FLX in wastewater samples, during 46 days...|$|R

40|$|Legal {{theory is}} {{a branch of}} {{political}} philosophy. This means that an adequate theory of law has {{to take a stand}} on certain contested issues in political philosophy. I don’t say “on all contested issues,” because there is more to political philosophy than what legal theory need address (although some deny even this limit). In making this overall point I will expand on some things I said about Scott Shapiro’s book, Legality (2011), in a review I wrote shortly after it came out. But I will structure what I say using a framework drawn from Julie Dickson’s Evaluation and Legal Theory (2001). Dickson’s book is about the <b>methodology</b> of <b>analytical</b> jurisprudence. <b>Methodology</b> should <b>follow</b> subject matter (in my opinion, which I suppose is the common-sense opinion) and not the reverse. But in the field of analytical legal philosophy, increasingly over recent years, methodology has come to define the subject matter. I hope to make some contribution toward setting this straight, {{and it would be a}} bigger contribution if I could persuade Shapiro and others to see the tasks of legal theory, or some of them, as I do. Analytical jurisprudence is an inquiry into the nature of law. Foremost among its tasks, it seeks to identify those necessary properties of law that capture its essence. Although Shapiro prefers to speak of “nature ” rather than “essence, ” it is clear that he is part of this enterprise (2011...|$|R

In this work we described {{the development of}} formulations of meglumine antimoniate injectable medication, {{as well as the}} <b>analytical</b> <b>methodology</b> used in the selective determination of Sb(III) and Sb(Total) by hydride generation - inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (HG-ICP-AES) and ICP-AES, respectively.

The formulations using propylene glycol/water as vehicles in a 20 : 80 proportion were more appropriate for subsequent use in industrial scale.
