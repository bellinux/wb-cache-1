In her first speech to the English Parliament, on 11 March, she distanced herself from her late Dutch brother-in-law and said, [...] "As I know my heart to be entirely English, I can very sincerely assure you there is not <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> expect or desire from me which I shall not be ready {{to do for the}} happiness and prosperity of England." ...|$|E

His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: [...] "Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'" [...] According to Sigurður, [...] "Collecting penises is like collecting <b>anything.</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> never stop, you can never catch up, you can always get a new one, a better one." ...|$|E
500|$|Hamm {{has been}} called the most {{marketable}} female athlete of her generation. During her time as an international soccer player, she signed endorsement deals with Gatorade, Nike, Dreyer's Ice Cream, Pepsi, Nabisco, Fleet Bank, Earthgrains, and Powerbar. Hamm was featured on a Wheaties box following the 1999 World Cup and endorsed the first Soccer Barbie by Mattel. She co-starred with Michael Jordan in a popular television commercial for Gatorade which featured the two athletes competing against each other in a variety of sports while the song <b>Anything</b> <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> Do (I Can Do Better) is heard. The commercial ends with Hamm throwing Jordan to the ground in a judo match. In 1997, she starred in a popular commercial for Pert Plus. In 2000, the video game, Mia Hamm Soccer 64 was released for Nintendo 64. It was the first game to feature female athletes only and sold a [...] "relatively high" [...] 42,886 copies in the United States.|$|E

The whole idea about the dude with Slayer in his arms was brought about because reality is scarier than <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> make up." [...] The production of the album posed as a challenge to the record company, [...] "how to market a group whose gore-soaked, extreme music is anathema to radio programmers." [...] It is the company's first attempt to [...] "hit the thrash band's core-audience of rabid enthusiasts with a fan-orientated marketing assault." [...] Araya related: [...] "We decided to take more time to bring this one together. We actually went into the studio with more written material than the past. We completed three out of seven songs outside the studio. We all sort of felt it was important to do it slowly. After the last tour, we had the intention to take the break." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wood {{struggled}} {{to be as}} efficient {{as possible in the}} often low-paying comics industry. Over time he created a series of layout techniques sketched on pieces of paper which he taped up near his drawing table. These [...] "visual notes," [...] collected on three pages, reminded Wood (and select assistants he showed the pages to) of various layouts and compositional techniques to keep his pages dynamic and interesting. (In the same vein, Wood also taped up another note to himself: [...] "Never draw <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> copy, never copy <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> trace, never trace <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> cut out and paste up.") ...|$|E

Those sort of bowlers, especially spinners, are a very rare breed in Australia. Batsmen here don't get much practice against a left hander. <b>Anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do a little different is a help." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his review, Roger Ebert {{defended the}} artistic license of Russian roulette, arguing [...] "it is the {{organizing}} {{symbol of the}} film: <b>Anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> believe about the game, about its deliberately random violence, about how it touches the sanity of men forced to play it, will apply to the war as a whole. It is a brilliant symbol because, {{in the context of}} this story, it makes any ideological statement about the war superfluous." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anthony {{was born}} in the Red Hook {{projects}} in Brooklyn, New York City. He was born to a Black Puerto Rican father and an African-American mother, Mary Anthony. His father (after whom he is named) died of cancer when Anthony was two years old. When Anthony turned eight, his family moved to Baltimore, where he honed not only his athletic skills, but his survival skills. Kenny Minor, one of Anthony's childhood friends, said, [...] "from drugs, to killings, to <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> name that goes on in the roughest parts of town, we've seen and witnessed hands on. Those are the things that teach you toughness and keep you mentally focused on your goals." [...] Sports would serve as an important diversion from the violence and drug dealing that were pervasive in the housing projects {{a few blocks from the}} homes of Anthony and his friends.|$|E
2500|$|Encouraged {{by their}} Australian success, the band {{undertook}} their first international tour. They {{flew to the}} UK on 17 September 1976 to play a show in London's Hyde Park supporting Queen. They then opened shows {{in the rest of}} Europe for the Hollies during September and October. Birtles advised fellow Australian bands that [...] "It's so much easier when you have a product to sell... And the money you make on the club circuit in Australia while establishing yourself is better than <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> make in Britain, where there is so much competition." [...] In November 1976 they performed their first US concert, in Harrisonburg, Virginia, as the opening act for Average White Band. Due to their US appearances and support from FM stations, [...] "It's a Long Way There" [...] reached No.28 on the Billboard Hot 100. This galvanised the commitment of the band members to tackle the US record market.|$|E

2500|$|Though Chamberlain {{was always}} very {{supportive}} of German imperialism, he had nothing but scorn for British imperialism, viewing Britain as the world's biggest bully, a view that he expressed more and more vehemently as the 1890s went on. In 1895, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt about the Hamidian massacres in the Ottoman Empire during 1894–96:The Armenian insurrection [...] with the inevitable retaliation of massacres and persecution (of course enormously exaggerated by those greatest liars in creation, backed by their worthy friends the English journalists) was all got up at the precise moment when English politics required a [...] "diversion". In 1896, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt:The English press is the most insufferably arrogant, generally ignorant, the most passionately one-sided and narrow-minded in its judgments that I know; it is the universal bully, always laying down the law for everybody, always speaking {{as if it were}} umpire of the universe, always abusing everybody all round and putting party spirit in all its judgments, envenoming thus the most peaceful discussions. It is this and this only which has made England hated all the world over. During the whole year 1895, I never opened an English newspaper without finding War predicated or threatened…No other nation in the world has wanted war or done anything but pray for peace-England alone, the world's bully, has been stirring it up on all sides. During the 1890s, Chamberlain was an outspoken critic of British policy in South Africa, writing to his uncle in 1898: We are the heathen nation and race par excellence. War, conquest, commerce, money and above all an eternal readiness to knock every man down who stands in our way. And the only thing thoroughly distasteful to me in England and Englishmen generally, and English politics in particular, is this eternal coquetting with a religion to which every one of their feelings and opinions and acts is in direct contradiction. At the time of the Boer War, Chamberlain supported the Boers against the British, though not publicly and he expressed much regret that two white peoples should be killing each other {{at a time when he}} believed that white supremacy around the world was being threatened by the alleged [...] "Yellow Peril". In July 1900, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt: One thing I can clearly see, that is that it is criminal for Englishmen and Dutchmen to go on murdering each other for all sorts of sophisticated reasons, while the Great Yellow Danger overshadows us white men and threatens destruction...The fact that a tiny nation of peasants absolutely untrained in the conduct of war, has been able to keep the whole united empire at bay for months, and has only been overcome-and has it been overcome?-by sending out an army superior in number to the whole population including women and children, has lowered respect for England beyond <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> imagine on your side of the water, and will certainly not remain lost on the minds of those countless millions who have hitherto been subdued by our prestige only. Chamberlain seized upon the fact that some of the Randlords were Jewish to argue in his letters to Cosima Wagner that the war was a case of Anglo-Jewish aggression against the Germanic Afrikaners. Wagner wrote back to Chamberlain: [...] "This extermination of one of the most excellent Germanic races is so horrible that I know of nothing I have experienced which is comparable to it".|$|E
