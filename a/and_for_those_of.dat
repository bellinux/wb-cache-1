2500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, most Puritans and Calvinists did not wear black for everyday, {{especially}} in England, Scotland and colonial America. Black dye was expensive, faded quickly and black clothing {{was reserved for}} the most formal occasions (including having one's portrait painted), for elders in a community <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> higher rank. Richer puritans, like their Dutch Calvinist contemporaries, probably did wear it often but in silk, often patterned. Typical colours for most were brown, murrey (mulberry, a brownish-maroon), dull greens and tawny colours. Wool and linen were preferred over silks and satins, though Puritan women of rank wore modest amounts of lace and embroidery as appropriate to their station, believing that the various ranks of society were divinely ordained and should be reflected {{even in the most}} modest dress. William Perkins wrote [...] "...that apparel is necessary for Scholar, the Tradesman, the Countryman, the Gentleman; which serveth not only to defend their bodies from cold, but which belongs also to the place, degree, calling, and condition of them all" [...] (Cases of Conscience, 1616).|$|E

6000|$|James, if not {{pressed in}} this fashion, had no {{particular}} reason for desiring Episcopal government of the Kirk, but being so pressed he saw no refuge save in bishops. Meanwhile his chief advisers--d'Aubigny, now Duke of Lennox, and James Stewart, the destroyer of Morton, now, to the prejudice of the Hamiltons, Earl of Arran--were men whose private life, at least in Arran's case, was scandalous. If Arran were a Protestant, he was impatient {{of the rule of}} the pulpiteers; and Lennox was working, if not sincerely in Mary's interests, certainly in his own <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the Catholic House of Guise. At the same time he favoured the king's Episcopal schemes, and, late in 1581, appointed a preacher named Montgomery to the recently vacant Archbishopric of Glasgow, while he himself, like Morton, drew most of the revenues. Hence arose tumults, and, late in 1581 and in 1582, priestly and Jesuit emissaries went and came, intriguing for a Catholic rising, to be supported by a large foreign force which they had not the slightest chance of obtaining from any quarter.

60|$|But I {{hear you}} asking me in alarm whether I have {{actually}} put all this tub thumping into a Don Juan comedy. I have not. I have only made my Don Juan a political pamphleteer, and given you his pamphlet in full by way of appendix. You will find {{it at the end}} of the book. I am sorry to say that it is a common practice with romancers to announce their hero as a man of extraordinary genius, and to leave his works entirely to the reader's imagination; so that {{at the end of the}} book you whisper to yourself ruefully that but for the author's solemn preliminary assurance you should hardly have given the gentleman credit for ordinary good sense. You cannot accuse me of this pitiable barrenness, this feeble evasion. I not only tell you that my hero wrote a revolutionists' handbook: I give you the handbook at full length for your edification if you care to read it.

Not that I disclaim the fullest responsibility for his opinions <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> all my characters, pleasant and unpleasant. They are all right from their several points of view; and their points of view are, for the dramatic moment, mine also. This may puzzle the people who believe that there is such a thing as an absolutely right point of view, usually their own. It may seem to them that nobody who doubts this can be in a state of grace. However that may be, it is certainly true that nobody who agrees with them can possibly be a dramatist, or indeed anything else that turns upon a knowledge of mankind. Hence it has been pointed out that Shakespear had no conscience. Neither have I, in that sense.|$|E
