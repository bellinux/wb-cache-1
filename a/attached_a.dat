5|$|For {{the shot}} of the levitating truck, which {{was used in the}} film to {{demonstrate}} the strange phenomena brought on by the coming of the alignment of the worlds, filmmakers <b>attached</b> <b>a</b> cement truck to a large hydraulic rig, which could be programmed to change speed and movement. In order to create Algrim's transformation into Kurse, Double Negative morphed live action performances of Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as both Algrim and Kurse. Double Negative then added in smoke and lava-like effects.|$|E
5|$|Samson went out, {{gathered}} 300 foxes, {{and tied}} {{them together in}} pairs by their tails. He then <b>attached</b> <b>a</b> burning torch to each pair of foxes' tails and turned them loose in the grain fields and olive groves of the Philistines. The Philistines learned why Samson burned their crops and burned Samson's wife and father-in-law to death in retribution.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{commonly}} used configurations of manifold. The oldest type is a tube with a connector on each end which {{is attached to}} the cylinder valve outlet, and an outlet connection in the middle, to which the regulator is <b>attached.</b> <b>A</b> variation on this pattern includes a reserve valve at the outlet connector. The cylinders are isolated from the manifold when closed, and the manifold can be attached or disconnected while the cylinders are pressurised.|$|E

5|$|Captain Pulteney Malcolm on Donegal {{attacked}} Brave directly, firing his starboard {{guns and}} then crossing Braves stern, inflicting severe damage with a raking broadside, before pulling alongside again and engaging from close range. Badly damaged, Brave surrendered. Malcolm then ordered Captain Richard Dunn in Acasta to take possession as Donegal moved forward to engage Jupiter. With Donegal alongside Jupiter, Captain Samuel Pym in Atlas abandoned his brief {{engagement with the}} French ship and steered for the melee surrounding the increasingly isolated Imp√©rial. Taking advantage of his ship's superior speed, Malcolm pulled ahead of Jupiter and then rammed her bow, securing the ships together to prevent the French vessel from escaping. Recognising that further resistance was hopeless, Captain Gaspard Laignel surrendered immediately. Malcolm then sent 100 men on board as a prize crew and <b>attached</b> <b>a</b> towline to the French ship, just as the trailing Agamemnon finally reached the battle.|$|E
5|$|During Resident Evil 5, Redfield {{discovers that}} Valentine {{is alive and}} goes in search of her. Wesker has <b>attached</b> <b>a</b> mind-control device to Valentine's chest, which makes her fight Redfield and his new partner, Sheva Alomar, a local agent. Valentine knows that she is doing this but is barely able to stop herself, {{although}} she has enough control to open her jumpsuit so that Alomar and Redfield can see the device. Alomar pulls it off and Valentine is freed from Wesker's control. She urges Alomar and Redfield to continue with their mission to stop Wesker. The DLC episode Desperate Escape describes Valentine's escape to safety {{with the help of}} another local BSAA agent, Josh Stone.|$|E
5|$|Further {{work was}} {{conducted}} by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have <b>attached</b> <b>a</b> metal key {{to the bottom of}} a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key {{to the back of his}} hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.|$|E

5|$|It also {{provided}} for the Court of First Instance (now known as the General Court) to be based in Luxembourg with the Court of Justice, which remained there. However, this agreement dropped the provision from the 1965 decision, which gave priority to Luxembourg for any new judicial and financial bodies. In response, Luxembourg <b>attached</b> <b>a</b> unilateral declaration stating it did not renounce this article. However they did renounce any claim to {{the seat of the}} judicial Boards of Appeal of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market via the Treaty of Nice.|$|E
5|$|Sir Thomas Modyford {{had been}} {{appointed}} the Governor of Jamaica in February 1664 with instructions to limit {{the activities of the}} privateers; he made a proclamation against their activities on 11 June 1664, but economic practicalities led to him reversing the policy {{by the end of the}} month. About 1,500 privateers used Jamaica as a base for their activity and brought significant revenue to the island. As the planting community of 5,000 was still new and developing, the revenue from the privateers was needed to avoid economic collapse. A privateer was granted a letter of marque which gave him a licence to attack and seize vessels, normally of a specific country, or with conditions <b>attached.</b> <b>A</b> portion of all spoils obtained by the privateers was given to the sovereign or the issuing ambassador.|$|E
5|$|The Mari Lwyd itself {{consists}} of a horse's skull that is decorated with ribbons and affixed to a pole; {{to the back of}} the skull is <b>attached</b> <b>a</b> white sheet, which drapes down to conceal both the pole and the individual carrying this device. On occasion, the horse's head was represented not by a skull but was instead made from wood or even paper. In some instances, the horse's jaw was able to open and close as a result of string or lever attached to it, and there are accounts of pieces of glass being affixed into the eye sockets of some examples, representing eyes. An observer of the tradition as it was performed at Llangynwyd during the nineteenth century noted that preparation for the activity was a communal event, with many locals involving themselves in the decorating of the Mari Lwyd.|$|E

5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{descriptions of}} the tree of heaven were made shortly after it was introduced to Europe by the French Jesuit Pierre Nicholas d'Incarville. D'Incarville had sent seeds from Peking via Siberia to his botanist friend Bernard de Jussieu in the 1740s. The seeds sent by d'Incarville {{were thought to be}} from the economically important and similar looking Chinese varnish tree (Toxicodendron vernicifluum), which he had observed in the lower Yangtze region, rather than the tree of heaven. D'Incarville <b>attached</b> <b>a</b> note indicating this, which caused much taxonomic confusion over the next few decades. In 1751, Jussieu planted a few seeds in France and sent others on to Philip Miller, the superintendent at the Chelsea Physic Garden, and to Philip C. Webb, the owner of an exotic plant garden in Busbridge, England.|$|E
5|$|To market Radioland Murders, Universal <b>attached</b> <b>a</b> film trailer to The Flintstones in May 1994. The studio {{believed}} both films would specifically {{appeal to}} the Baby Boom Generation. Radioland Murders was originally set to be theatrically released in September 1994 before it was pushed back. The film was released in the United States on October 21, 1994 in 844 theaters, only grossing $1.37 million. Ultimately the film bombed {{at the box office}} because it did not recoup its $15 million budget. It ranks among the top ten widely released films for having the biggest second weekend drop at the box office, dropping 78.5% from $835,570 to $179,315.|$|E
5|$|Many {{critics have}} {{challenged}} the second premise of this argument, {{by offering a}} biological and sociological account {{of the development of}} human morality which suggests that it is neither objective nor absolute. This account, supported by biologist E. O. Wilson and philosopher Michael Ruse, proposes that the human experience of morality is a by-product of natural selection, a theory philosopher Mark D. Linville calls evolutionary naturalism. According to the theory, the human experience of moral obligations was the result of evolutionary pressures, which <b>attached</b> <b>a</b> sense of morality to human psychology because it was useful for moral development; this entails that moral values do not exist independently of the human mind. Morality might be better understood as an evolutionary imperative in order to propagate genes and ultimately reproduce. No human society today advocates immorality, such as theft or murder, because it would undoubtedly lead to the end of that particular society and any chance for future survival of offspring. Scottish empiricist David Hume made a similar argument, that belief in objective moral truths is unwarranted and to discuss them is meaningless.|$|E

5|$|William Rufus {{granted the}} town, abbey and mint to a royal physician, John of Tours, who became Bishop of Wells and Abbot of Bath, {{following}} the sacking {{of the town}} during the Rebellion of 1088. It was papal policy for bishops to move to more urban seats, and John of Tours translated his own from Wells to Bath. The bishop planned and began a much larger church as his cathedral, to which was <b>attached</b> <b>a</b> priory, with the bishop's palace beside it. New baths were built around the three springs. Later bishops returned the episcopal seat to Wells while retaining the name Bath in the title, Bishop of Bath and Wells. St John's Hospital was founded around 1180 by Bishop Reginald Fitz Jocelin and is among the oldest almshouses in England. The 'hospital of the baths' was built beside the hot springs of the Cross Bath, for their health-giving properties and to provide shelter for the poor infirm.|$|E
