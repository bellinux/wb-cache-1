5|$|A case {{somewhat}} similar to Batesian mimicry {{is that of}} mimetic weeds, which imitate agricultural crops. In weed or Vavilovian mimicry, the weed survives by having seeds which winnowing machinery identifies <b>as</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> the crop. Vavilovian mimicry is not Batesian, because man and crop are not enemies.|$|E

5|$|Characteristics of {{the tail}} {{vertebrae}} {{and the presence of}} osteoderms indicate that Ampelosaurus belongs to Lithostrotia, a group of derived titanosaurians which also includes Alamosaurus and Saltasaurus. Many other paleotologists have classified Ampelosaurus <b>as</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> Titanosauria, Saltasauridae, and Titanosauridae. Ampelosaurus may have an uncertain classification, but it is clearly a titanosaur, with many features found in titanosaurs.|$|E

5|$|During the Hellenistic period, mythology {{took on the}} {{prestige}} of elite knowledge that marks its possessors <b>as</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> a certain class. At the same time, the skeptical turn of the Classical age became even more pronounced. Greek mythographer Euhemerus established the tradition of seeking an actual historical basis for mythical beings and events. Although his original work (Sacred Scriptures) is lost, much is known about it from what is recorded by Diodorus and Lactantius.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Lisa Rosenberger {{published}} a phylogenetic analysis of 14 Dasyatis species, based on morphology. The common stingray {{was reported to}} be the most basal member of the genus, other than the bluespotted stingray (D. kuhlii) and pelagic stingray (D. violacea). However, D. violacea has generally been recognized <b>as</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> its own genus Pteroplatytrygon, and recently D. kuhlii has also been placed in a different genus, Neotrygon.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus, who {{classified}} most {{kinds of}} sessile animals <b>as</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> the order Zoophyta {{in the class}} Vermes, mistakenly identified the genus Spongia as plants in the order Algae. For a long time thereafter sponges were assigned to a separate subkingdom, Parazoa ("beside the animals"), separate from the Eumetazoa which formed {{the rest of the}} kingdom Animalia. They have been regarded as a paraphyletic phylum, from which the higher animals have evolved. Other research indicates Porifera is monophyletic.|$|E
5|$|Subfossil {{bones of}} the Mascarene grey parakeet found on Mauritius were first {{described}} in 1973 <b>as</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> a smaller relative of the broad-billed parrot in the genus Lophopsittacus.

The subfossils were later connected with 17th- and 18th-century descriptions of small grey parrots on Mauritius and Réunion, together with a single illustration published in a journal describing a voyage in 1602, and the species was instead reassigned to the genus Psittacula.|$|E

5|$|Teeth {{from what}} is now {{documented}} as a Tyrannosaurus rex were found in 1874 by Arthur Lakes near Golden, Colorado. In the early 1890s, John Bell Hatcher collected postcranial elements in eastern Wyoming. The fossils {{were believed to be}} from a large species of Ornithomimus (O. grandis) but are now considered Tyrannosaurus rex remains. Vertebral fragments found by Edward Drinker Cope in western South Dakota in 1892 and assigned to Manospondylus gigas have also been recognized <b>as</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> Tyrannosaurus rex.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{has been}} {{described}} <b>as</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> the genres of revisionist history and feminist literature, and employs themes of gender, religion, and power. Bradley wrote it after the success of her 1983 novel The Mists of Avalon, a re-telling of the Arthurian legend from a female perspective. To appeal to a wider readership, The Firebrand includes fewer elements of fantasy than Bradley's previous works. Her only novel set in ancient Greece, her husband Walter H. Breen helped her research the story.|$|E
