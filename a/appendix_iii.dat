Moreover, the unusual four-horned skull and the horns have been a popular target for trophy hunters. In India, the species is protected under Schedule I the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 and the Nepalese population is listed in CITES <b>Appendix</b> <b>III.</b> The {{four-horned antelope}} is classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|In the Mediterranean Sea, the {{porbeagle}} is on {{the verge}} of extinction, with a population decline of over 99.99% since the mid-20th century. Its range has contracted to the waters around the Italian Peninsula, where there may be a nursery area. Only a few dozen specimens have been recorded in the past few decades, from scientific surveys, swordfish fishery bycatch, and sport fishers. In 1995, it was included in Annex III ("species whose exploitation is regulated") of the Barcelona Convention Protocol on protected areas and biodiversity in the Mediterranean, which has not been ratified. In 1997, it was listed on <b>Appendix</b> <b>III</b> of the Bern Convention (the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats). However, these listings have yet to result in the implementation of new management plans, despite the recognized need for urgent action.|$|E

25|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, {{the very last}} strongholds of the European moose {{appeared}} to be in Fennoscandian areas and patchy tracts of Russia, with a few migrants found in what is now Estonia and Lithuania. The USSR and Poland managed to restore portions of the range within its borders (such as the 1951 reintroduction into Kampinos National Park and the later 1958 reintroduction in Belarus), but political complications limited the ability to reintroduce it to other portions of its range. Attempts in 1930 and again in 1967 in marshland north of Berlin were unsuccessful. At present in Poland, populations are recorded in the Biebrza river valley, Kampinos, and in Białowieża Forest. It has migrated into other parts of Eastern Europe and has been spotted in eastern and southern Germany. Unsuccessful thus far in recolonizing these areas via natural dispersal from source populations in Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Czech Republic and Slovakia, it appears to be having more success migrating south into the Caucasus.

40|$|New {{applications}} in electronics and optics require methods of forming micro- and nanostructures {{in ways that}} are applicable to different classes of materials and substrates. These methods should also be simple, inexpensive, and accessible to the greatest number of users possible. This dissertation explores several unconventional methods of forming micro- and nanostructures for electronic and optical applications. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the most prominent method of nanofabrication in this dissertation, nanoskiving, which is the use of mechanical sectioning of encapsulated thin films to generate nanostructures. Several ancillary techniques are used to prepare substrates for nanoskiving: shadow evaporation, chemical synthesis, electrodeposition, soft lithographic molding, spin-coating, and rolling. Chapter 2, Appendix I, II, and IV, survey the materials and methods of nanoskiving. <b>Appendices</b> <b>III</b> and VI describe combinations of nanoskiving with soft lithographic molding to generate and replicate two-dimensional structures for electronic and optical applications. Chapter 3 and Appendix V detail contact and non-contact methods to manipulate the structures produced by nanoskivin...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} the coalescence of fluid drops at flat interfaces and in laminar shear flow. The investigation was undertaken as one of a series which have been conducted in this laboratory on the behaviour of suspensions of fluid and rigid particles. The method of presentation requires some explanation. Part I deals briefly with the nature of the problem, a short review of the background and the objectives and scope of the investigations. The main experimental work is presented in Parts II, III, and IV. These parts have been written to achieve brevity without loss of clarity and to permit publication in the scientific literature without further modification [...] For this reason certain experimental and technical details have been omitted from the main text and presented in Appendices V to VIII. Concluding Remarks and Suggestions for Further are given in Part V. Some results of experiments on the effect of emulsifiers on coalescence and the action of defoamers are contained in Appendices I and II, and the experimental verification of a previously derived theoretical equation for the approach of a sphere to a plane interface is given in <b>Appendices</b> <b>III</b> and IV...|$|R
