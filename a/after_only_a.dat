5|$|A large {{army was}} {{assembled}} slowly and marched into Scotland. Not only was no pitched battle ever attempted, but the king {{did not try}} and besiege Scotland's capital, Edinburgh. Henry's army left {{at the end of}} the summer <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> brief stay, mostly camped near Leith (near Edinburgh) where it could maintain contact with its supply fleet. The campaign ultimately accomplished little except to further deplete the king's coffers, and is historically notable only for being the last one led by an English king on Scottish soil.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few Segunda División matches, Pablo {{received}} his first call-up to the Spanish under-21 team, for a friendly match against Bulgaria on 19 November 2002. Despite the media's assumption {{that he would}} be among the substitutes, he played the whole match as Spain won 7–1. He was a regular selection over the next 12 months, and finished his under-21 career with ten caps. His last appearances came as Spain were eliminated by Sweden in the qualification play-offs for the 2004 European Under-21 Championships.|$|E

5|$|At age twenty-seven, {{he entered}} the Monastery of Stoudios, giving his life over {{completely}} to discipleship to his teacher Symeon the Studite. The elder Symeon was not an ordained priest, but a simple monk who was considered holy by many people. The younger Symeon was extremely zealous in his practices and in following his teacher—to {{such an extent that}} the abbot of the monastery insisted that Symeon leave <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few months.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, Australia's economy had been quite small and {{dependent}} largely upon agriculture and the resources industries for export earnings, while most manufactured products were imported from overseas. Almost immediately uncertainty over the continuation of foreign trade led to a rise in unemployment, indeed it was estimated that <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> couple of days of Britain having declared war, that up to 15,000 men had been retrenched in New South Wales alone due to concerns about the continued availability of foreign markets for Australian produce.|$|E

5|$|Crease {{was born}} at Ince Castle, in Cornwall, {{the son of a}} Royal Navy captain. He earned his BA from Clare College, Cambridge and then studied law at the Middle Temple. Though called to the bar in June 1849, he did not {{immediately}} pursue his career in law. Instead he joined his parents in an unsuccessful canal building endeavour in Upper Canada. <b>After</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> short turn as a barrister on his return to England, he took a job in Cornwall managing a tin mine owned by Great Wheal Vor United Mines, which ended with his employer suing him.|$|E
5|$|David joined WISPA {{and turned}} {{professional}} in 2000 {{when she won}} her first WISPA title, <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> month in the tour. The victory came in February, when she defeated Salma Shabana in {{the final of the}} Savcor Finnish Open with a score of 9–1, 9–0 and 9–5. Within a month, Hotel Equatorial announced its two-year worldwide sponsorship for her. David also won a sponsorship on the WISPA tour by Dunlop squash.|$|E
5|$|During closing arguments, {{defense counsel}} John Pope {{attempted}} to discredit Darby; the latter reacted by assaulting one of Pope's co-counselors with a cane. The trial lasted thirteen days, {{and despite the}} absence of any physical evidence, including a murder weapon, the jury returned <b>a</b> guilty verdict <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> hour of deliberation on May 19. Beauchamp was sentenced to be executed by hanging on June 16, 1826.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the second}} U-boat stealthily maneuvered to attack Block Island, Bronstein made sonar contact {{on her and}} {{immediately}} began dropping depth charges. <b>After</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> hour's work, the warship's crew received the reward of a tremendous explosion that {{could only have been}} the end of the submarine, later identified as [...] The hunter-killer group put into Casablanca on 8 March for voyage repairs and refueling.|$|R
50|$|Mainwaring briefs {{the men on}} the exercise, {{and takes}} the {{opportunity}} to ridicule Captain Square and the Eastgate platoon's efforts the previous weeks (he was captured <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> hour). Unbeknownst to Mainwaring, the Verger and Warden are watching them, discussing their plans to sabotage the platoon's efforts, on the orders of Captain Square who has offered them a pound each to foil Mainwaring.|$|R
5|$|Dirty Dancing has {{appeared}} in other forms than the stage version. In 1988, a music tour named Dirty Dancing: Live in Concert, featuring Bill Medley and Eric Carmen, played 90 cities in three months.

The series was canceled <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few episodes.|$|E
5|$|He {{grew up in}} Nordhausen {{in central}} Germany and was {{orphaned}} at an early age. After embarking on a nautical career {{at the age of}} 16, he served briefly in the Imperial German Navy {{at the start of the}} 20th century. His ill health forced him to abandon a naval career, but he remained in the naval reserve. He joined the Hamburg America Line to work as a tour guide. While escorting a party of tourists, he met and married a German-American woman, but the marriage broke down <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few months. His wife divorced him and he returned to Berlin.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} manager of Football Conference club Dover Athletic in December 2001. His managing stint at the Kent club {{was short and}} he was sacked in March 2002, <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few months in charge, after the club's new owners decided to promote his assistant Clive Walker. He later made cameo appearances as a player at Canvey Island. He also began teaching young people from deprived backgrounds how to coach in a community scheme called Soccer Skills, and later worked in the special education sector. He set up his own educational consultancy that specialised in working with NEETs, in partnership with Brooklands College.|$|E
5000|$|MTV France has {{launched}} the French version (...) of the American show on January 24, 2007. The format {{was different from}} the original concept: there wasn't the countdown with the 10 favourite videos and in every episode there was a movie's mini-documentaries entitled [...] The show closed <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> episode on January 25, 2007 and it has cancelled from the schedule of MTV France.|$|R

5|$|In 1898 an Austrian chemist Auer von Welsbach {{developed}} the Oslamp with a filament made of osmium, which he introduced commercially in 1902. <b>After</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few years, osmium {{was replaced by}} the more stable metal tungsten. Tungsten has the highest melting point among all metals, and its use in light bulbs increases the luminous efficacy and life of incandescent lamps.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, while {{studying}} mathematics at Poznań University, Rejewski attended a secret cryptology course {{conducted by the}} Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau (Biuro Szyfrów), which he joined in September 1932. The Bureau had had no success in reading Enigma-enciphered messages and set Rejewski {{to work on the}} problem in late 1932; he deduced the machine's secret internal wiring <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few weeks. Rejewski and his two colleagues then developed successive techniques for the regular decryption of Enigma messages. His contributions included the cryptologic card catalog, derived using the cyclometer that he had invented, and the cryptologic bomb.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Newman {{devised a}} thriller series for ABC called Police Surgeon, {{starring}} Ian Hendry. Although Police Surgeon {{was not a}} success and was cancelled <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> short run, Newman took Hendry as the star, {{and some of the}} ethos of the programme, to create a new series (not a direct sequel as is sometimes claimed) called The Avengers. Debuting in January 1961, The Avengers became an international success, although in later years its premise differed somewhat from Newman's initial set-up, veering into more humorous territory rather than remaining a gritty thriller.|$|E
5000|$|Young gives {{credit to}} [...] Dennis Johnson, a former schoolmate and {{composer}} from UCLA, for inspiring The Well-Tuned Piano. Johnson wrote an extensive, improvisatory, solo piano piece titled November in 1959, {{a few years}} before Young began working on The Well-Tuned Piano. Although the piece is said to be as long as six hours, the tape recording made in 1962 cuts off suddenly <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> hour and a half.|$|R

5|$|In {{the seventh}} stage to Bordeaux, Trousselier {{punctured}} <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few kilometers. The {{rest of the}} cyclists quickly sped away from him, and Trousselier had to follow them alone for 200km. A few kilometers before Bordeaux, Trousselier {{caught up with the}} rest, and even managed to win the sprint. Louis Trousselier kept his lead {{until the end of the}} race, winning five stages. Trousselier was accused of bad sportsmanship: he reportedly smashed the inkstands of a control post to prevent his opponents from signing. Unlike the 1904 Tour de France, no stage winners, nor anyone from the top ten of the general classification, were disqualified.|$|E
5|$|Priestley {{founded the}} Theological Repository in 1768, a journal {{committed}} to the open and rational inquiry of theological questions. Although he promised to print any contribution, only like-minded authors submitted articles. He was therefore obliged to provide much of the journal's content himself (this material {{became the basis for}} many of his later theological and metaphysical works). <b>After</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few years, {{due to a lack of}} funds, he was forced to cease publishing the journal. He revived it in 1784 with similar results.|$|E
5|$|Smetana's first {{noteworthy}} public {{success was}} his initial opera The Brandenburgers in Bohemia, in 1866 {{when he was}} already 42 years old. His second opera, The Bartered Bride, survived the unfortunate mistiming of its opening night and became an enduring popular triumph. The different style of his third opera, Dalibor, closer to that of Wagnerian music drama, was not readily understood by the public and was condemned by critics who believed that Czech opera {{should be based on}} folk-song. It disappeared from the repertory <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> handful of performances. Thereafter the machinations that accompanied Smetana's tenure as Provisional Theatre conductor restricted his creative output until 1874.|$|E
50|$|Despite only playing {{four major}} league {{games for the}} Giants, Uggla {{received}} a World Series ring <b>after</b> <b>only</b> being <b>a</b> member of the 2014 championship team for that short period.|$|R

6000|$|On the {{verandah}} {{he stopped}} short on purpose to address to us anxiously a long remark which I {{failed to understand}} completely. It sounded like some horrible unknown language. But when Captain Giles, <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> instant for reflection, assured him with homely friendliness, [...] "Aye, to be sure. You are right there," [...] he appeared very much gratified indeed, and went away (pretty straight, too) to seek a distant long chair.|$|R
