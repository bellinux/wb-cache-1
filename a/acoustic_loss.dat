40|$|Measurements of {{ultrasound}} {{wave velocity}} and attenuation {{are used to}} investigate the structure of Na(_ 2) O-B(_ 2) O(_ 3) -SiO(_ 2) glasses. The propagation characteristics of longitudinal and shear waves between 1. 3 K and 400 K at frequencies between 12 MHz and 60 MHz are dominated by a broad and intense <b>acoustic</b> <b>loss</b> peak whose height and position are frequency sensitive. Of the previously proposed models for the mechanism of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>loss,</b> which also occurs in other inorganic glasses, the ultrasound absorption is most consistent with a thermally activated structural relaxation involving the transverse vibration of an oxygen atom between two potential wells of equal or nearly equal depth in the plane of a non linear cation-oxygen-cation bond. An Akhieser type acoustic phonon-thermal phonon interaction is shown no {{to be responsible for}} the observed loss. An attempt frequency of l 0 (^ 13) Hz and a distribution of activation energies out to 12 K cal/mole but with a mean value of about 3 K cal/mole are found for the relaxation mechanism in the Na(_ 2) O-B(_ 2) O(_ 3) -SiO(_ 2) glasses. The absolute value and the temperature coefficient of ultrasound velocity, and the maximum <b>acoustic</b> <b>loss</b> are strongly dependent on the total Na(_ 2) O content of the glasses. Ultrasound propagation characteristics are also affected by phase-separation inducing heat treatment: the steady rise in the height of the loss peak and the complex behaviour of the ultrasound velocity with time of treatment suggest that structural rearrangement is still taking place in the individual glassy phases even after long periods of heat treatment. Also reported is the existence of a small <b>acoustic</b> <b>loss</b> peak at liquid helium temperatures in the Na(_ 2) O-B(_ 2) O(_ 2) -SiO(_ 2) glasses. This feature of the ultrasound absorption spectrum is characteristic of many tetrahedrally coordinated inorganic glasses.

This is attributed to freezing of a succession of strain-coupled defects with a range of relaxation times and is consistent with a report in the literature that PFN develops a tweed microstructure over a wide temperature interval. No overt anomaly was observed near the expected Neel point, similar to 145 K, consistent with weak/absent spin/lattice coupling but heat capacity measurements showed that the antiferromagnetic transition is actually smeared out or suppressed. Instead, the sample is weakly ferromagnetic up to similar to 560 K, though it has not been possible to exclude definitively the possibility that this could be due to some magnetic impurity.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study of the acoustic properties of an automotive air intake system. Modern air intake systems for personal cars are largely made of plastic materials. When trying to make an acoustic model for the sound transmission through the intake system it is questionable if the walls of different components can be modelled as acoustically rigid. The <b>acoustic</b> <b>losses</b> which determine the transmitted sound level at breakthrough frequencies may be especially difficult to model. To find out if <b>acoustic</b> <b>losses</b> associated with wall vibrations or with flow interaction are dominating for a typical intake system an experimental investigation has been performed. The acoustic plane-wave transmission matrices have been measured, using the two-source replacement technique, for the complete intake system and for separate parts. Measurements were made in a flow test rig without flow and for two different flow speeds. The measurements were then repeated with sand loading on the walls to reduce wall vibrations. The results indicate that flow related losses dominates at low frequencies while losses associated with acoustically non-rigid walls dominate at higher frequencies, giving an additional transmission loss in the order of 2 dB for the complete system. Both effects will therefore have {{to be taken into account}} in an accurate model. Comparisons will also be made between results from an acoustic FE-model and experimental results.

For purely structural transitions they would be described as improper ferroelastic and therefore fulfil the condition for multiferroic phase {{transitions in}} combining {{two out of three}} properties, ferro/antiferromagnetism, ferroelectricity and ferroelasticity. Here lattice parameter data from the literature and new measurements of elastic and anelastic properties, by resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, for NdCo₂ and ErCo₂ have been analysed from this perspective. The temperature dependence of symmetry-breaking shear strains is consistent with the cubic ↔ tetragonal transition in NdCo₂ being close to tricritical in character and the cubic ↔ rhombohedral transition in ErCo₂ being first order. Elastic softening and <b>acoustic</b> <b>loss</b> within the stability ranges of the ferroelastic phases can be understood in terms of a combination of intrinsic softening due to strain/order parameter coupling and ferroelastic twin-wall motion. Softening ahead of the transitions does not fit with standard macroscopic descriptions of dynamic effects from other systems but, rather, in the case of NdCo₂, might be attributed to the involvement of a second zone centre order parameter related to a separate instability driven by cooperative Jahn–Teller distortions.
