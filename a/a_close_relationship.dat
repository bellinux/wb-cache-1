5|$|Conversely, the {{woodwasp}} {{is fully}} {{dependent on the}} symbionts. Decomposition enables the larvae to unlock the wood by producing white rot.

Without the process of decomposition of the host tree and weakening of the infested tree, the development of larvae is arrested. If the tree can recover {{from the consequences of}} the wasp secretion, it blocks the boreholes with resin, thus killing the larvae.|$|E

Any such programme could attempt to control disease mainly by preventive methods, establish a complete parasite control programme and incorporate a high degree of instruction.
