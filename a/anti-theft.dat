25|$|Ayres and Levitt (1998) used a new dataset on the {{prevalence}} of LoJack automobile <b>anti-theft</b> devices to estimate the social externality associated with its use. They find that the marginal social benefit of Lojack is fifteen {{times greater than the}} marginal social cost in high crime areas, but that those who install LoJack obtain less than ten percent of the total social benefits.|$|E
25|$|The 1986 Corvette saw the {{reintroduction}} of {{the convertible}} {{and was named}} as the Pace Car for the Indianapolis 500. 1986 also saw {{the introduction of the}} Pass Key I passive <b>anti-theft</b> system, wherein each key contained a special pellet that could be detected and identified by the car's computer system by detecting electrical resistance. Being early in the rollout of this new technology, there were only 15 different resistance values available, which, once thieves discovered this weakness, markedly reduced the value of this early system.|$|E
25|$|The VAM Javelin saw {{considerable}} aesthetic {{changes with}} only minor technical ones. The VAM models included the same novelties as its AMC counterpart, {{such as new}} headlight bezels and grille, smooth front fender extensions and bumpers without divisions, larger tail lights without wraparound portions and a single central back-up light, larger side marker lights with both light and reflector sections in both amber and red, and new wheel cover designs resembling Magnum 500 wheels. The discontinuation of the central rear reflector {{in favor of the}} back-up light resulted in the addition of a fourth Javelin emblem placed on the right corner of the trunk lid. Two hood designs were available, the one with the Ram Air-type scoops at the front center, and a smoother one with the two rectangular stripped bulges. Despite this, no Ram Air system was ever offered for the car, at least at a factory level. In the interior, a new collapsible steering column with built-in ignition switch and <b>anti-theft</b> lock plus a new simulated two-arm three-spoke sports steering wheel with a central bulls eye emblem were present. A secondary <b>anti-theft</b> mechanism was present {{in the form of the}} floor-mounted shifters being linked to the ignition switch regardless of the transmission type. AMC's new dashboard design included full woodgrain surfaces, complete with a new center console and shifter design for the automatic transmission. However, all three gauges were still the same as in the previous two years. New door panels were also included.|$|E
25|$|Vault {{technology}} {{developed in}} a type of arms race with bank robbers. As burglars came up with new ways to break into vaults, vault makers found innovative ways to foil them. Modern vaults may be armed with {{a wide array of}} alarms and <b>anti-theft</b> devices. Some nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century vaults were built so well that today they are almost impossible to destroy. These older vaults were typically made with steel-reinforced concrete. The walls were usually at least 1ft (0.3 m) thick, and the door itself was typically 3.5ft (1.1 m) thick. Total weight ran into the hundreds of tons (see the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland). Today vaults are made with thinner, lighter materials that, while still secure, are easier to dismantle than their earlier counterparts.|$|E
25|$|For 1974, a new {{rear bumper}} system {{replaced}} the squared tail and chrome rear bumper blades introduced in 1968 with a trim, tapering urethane cover carrying an integral license plate holder and recesses for the trademark round taillights. Underneath sat a box-section aluminum impact bar on two Omark-bolt slider brackets {{similar to the}} system used in the nose which allowed the Corvette to pass federal five-mph impact tests at the rear {{as well as the}} front. The new rear design was quite beautiful, and more up-to-date than the 60's shape that it replaced with the vast majority of enthusiasts embracing the new design. For the 1974 model only, casting limitations mandated left and right bumper covers with a vertical center seam. The <b>anti-theft</b> alarm key activator was moved from the rear panel to the front left fender. Tailpipes were now turned down as the new bumper cover eliminated the tailpipe extensions.|$|E
25|$|A {{firmware}} rootkit uses device or platform firmware {{to create}} a persistent malware image in hardware, such as a router, network card, hard drive, or the system BIOS. The rootkit hides in firmware, because firmware is not usually inspected for code integrity. John Heasman demonstrated the viability of firmware rootkits in both ACPI firmware routines and in a PCI expansion card ROM. In October 2008, criminals tampered with European credit card-reading machines before they were installed. The devices intercepted and transmitted credit card details via a mobile phone network. In March 2009, researchers Alfredo Ortega and Anibal Sacco published details of a BIOS-level Windows rootkit that was able to survive disk replacement and operating system re-installation. A few months later they learned that some laptops are sold with a legitimate rootkit, known as Absolute CompuTrace or Absolute LoJack for Laptops, preinstalled in many BIOS images. This is an <b>anti-theft</b> technology system that researchers showed can be turned to malicious purposes.|$|E
25|$|Many of the membership-based {{systems are}} {{operated}} through public-private partnerships. Several European cities, including the French cities of Lyon and Paris {{as well as}} London, Barcelona, Stockholm and Oslo, have signed contracts with private advertising agencies (JCDecaux in Brussels, Lyon, Paris, Seville and Dublin; Clear Channel in Stockholm, Oslo, Barcelona, Antwerp, Perpignan and Zaragoza) which supply the city with thousands of bicycles free of charge (or for a minor fee). In return, the agencies are allowed to advertise both on the bikes themselves and in other select locations in the city. Some other programmes are not linked to an advertising deal (for example Smoove) and are financed {{as a part of}} public transportation scheme. These programmes attempt to reduce losses from theft by requiring users to purchase subscriptions with a credit card or debit card (this option requiring a large, temporary deposit) and by equipping the bike with complex <b>anti-theft</b> and bike maintenance sensors. If the bike is not returned within the subscription period, or returned with significant damage, the bike sharing operator withdraws money from the user's credit card account.|$|E
2500|$|The laptops {{include an}} <b>anti-theft</b> system which can, optionally, require each laptop to {{periodically}} {{make contact with}} a server to renew its cryptographic lease token. If the cryptographic lease expires before the server is contacted, the laptop will be locked until a new token is provided. The contact may be to a country-specific server over a network or to a local, school-level server that has been manually loaded with cryptographic [...] "lease" [...] tokens that enable a laptop to run for days or even months between contacts. Cryptographic lease tokens can be supplied on a USB flash drive for non-networked schools. The mass production laptops are also tivoized, disallowing installation of additional software or replacement of the operating system. Users interested in development need to obtain the unlocking key separately (most developer laptops for Western users already come unlocked). It is claimed that locking prevents unintentional bricking and {{is part of the}} <b>anti-theft</b> system.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} 3.1L V6, {{installed in}} SE models, gained 15 horsepower (now 175). New standard equipment included rear child-seat anchors and an <b>anti-theft</b> system that disabled the starter unless the proper ignition key was used. Pontiac also launched a Daytona 500 pace-car replica, with silver paint, unique [...] aluminum wheels, functional hood vents, a NASCAR-inspired decklid spoiler, polished quad exhaust tips, and Daytona decals. Only 2,000 were planned.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} {{period of the}} {{issuance}} of postage stamps in the United States a number of patents were issued for cancelling devices or machines that increased (or were purported to increase) the difficulty of washing off and reusing postage stamps. [...] These methods generally involved the scraping or cutting-away of part of the stamp, or perhaps punching a hole through its middle. [...] (These forms of cancellation must be distinguished from perfins, {{a series of small}} holes punched in stamps, typically by private companies as an <b>anti-theft</b> device.) ...|$|E
2500|$|According to British {{historian}} Alan Bullock, [...] "the total Soviet grain crop was {{no worse}} than that of 1931... {{it was not a}} crop failure but the excessive demands of the state, ruthlessly enforced, that cost the lives of as many as five million Ukrainian peasants." [...] Stalin refused to release large grain reserves that could have alleviated the famine, while continuing to export grain, and he strictly enforced new draconian <b>anti-theft</b> laws on the collective farm. Other historians hold the view that it was largely the insufficient harvests of 1931 and 1932 caused by a variety of natural disasters that resulted in famine, with the successful harvest of 1933 ending the famine.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1999, several {{noteworthy}} {{changes for}} the P11 came as a refresh in the 2000 model year, when the 145 crank horsepower roller rocker variant of the SR20DE engine was implemented, newer automatic and manual transmission variations were introduced, <b>anti-theft</b> immobilizer circuitry was added, anti-glare side mirrors became standard, and a remote trunk release {{was added to the}} keyless entry fob. In 2001, the G20t was dropped and a Sport model was introduced. In addition to the prior G20t's limited slip differential and decklid spoiler, this model featured two-tone leather/suede sport seats, 16" [...] wheels, and a variety of minor cosmetic modifications. The 2002 base G20 received the 12-spoke Touring alloy wheels as standard.|$|E
2500|$|Tsarnaev and {{his brother}} murdered MIT police officer Sean Collier on April 18 at the MIT campus in an {{unsuccessful}} attempt to steal his gun, before traveling to the Boston neighborhood of Allston. There, the brothers carjacked an SUV and robbed the owner. However, {{the owner of the}} car, said he managed to escape when the Tsarnaevs became momentarily distracted in the process of refueling the car at a cash-only gas station. The man, who would not give his name to the media but said he goes by the name [...] "Danny," [...] said he fled to another nearby gas station and contacted the police. Police were then able to track the location of the car through the man's cellphone and the SUV's <b>anti-theft</b> tracking device.|$|E
2500|$|This Batmobile's gadgets {{include a}} nose-mounted {{aluminum}} Cable Cutter Blade, Bat Ray Projector, <b>Anti-Theft</b> Device, Detect-a-scope, Batscope, Bat Eye Switch, Antenna Activator, Police Band Cut-In Switch, Automatic Tire Inflation Device, Remote Batcomputer—radio {{linked to the}} main Batcomputer in the Batcave, the Batphone, Emergency Bat Turn Lever, Anti-Fire Activator, Bat Smoke, Bat Photoscope, and many other Bat gadgets. If needed, the Batmobile is capable of a quick 180° [...] "bat-turn" [...] thanks to two rear-mounted ten-foot Deist parachutes. [...] The main license plate seen throughout the series was 2F-3567 (1966). Some changes were made during {{the run of the}} series, including different license plates (TP-3567; BT-1 and BAT-1), removal of the Futura steering wheel and substitution with a 1958 Edsel steering wheel, and the addition of extra gadgets such as a net in the trunk, remote-controlled driving, a rear-facing camera under the turbine exhaust port, and the Bat Ram.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, {{the same}} way then 1996, there were two {{different}} phases: In the first one, the Beetle kept being sold {{the same way}} as in previous years (Volkswagen Sedán City and Volkswagen Sedán Clásico), while in the second one, both versions were replaced by a new [...] "unique" [...] version, mostly referred to as the Volkswagen Sedán Unificado, which takes the City's upholstery, and the improvements and the metallic colors from the Sedán Clásico. This new Volkswagen Beetle was the last regular version which remained unchanged until 2003. This year appeared, in addition to the <b>anti-theft</b> alarm and with the intention of lowering the high index of thefts and therefore, the extraordinarily expensive premiums of insurance policies, the Transponder, a device with an entry located in the dashboard, which allows the ignition and operation of the car. When it was offline, the car cannot even be started when using the ignition key.|$|E
2500|$|The 1969 98 {{conventional}} front engine/rear drive car {{remained the}} top-of-the-line Oldsmobile. It {{was the largest}} Oldsmobile product offered and now had a [...] wheelbase. Six body styles were now available with a hardtop version of the Luxury Sedan added to the lineup. New to the 98 series were a recessed padded instrument panel, <b>anti-theft</b> lock within the steering column, rear view mirror map light, mini-buckle seat belts, and deeply padded head restraints. Standard equipment included: power brakes, self-regulating electric clock, full carpeting, courtesy lamps, paint stripes, power seat adjuster, seat belts and shoulder harnasses, power steering, Deluxe steering wheel, power windows, Turbo-Hydramatic transmission, custom sport seat, foam padded front seat, and wheel discs (hub caps). Standard tire size was 8.85 x 14inches. Upholstery was vinyl, cloth or leather. The 98's standard engine was still the Rocket 455 which required premium leaded gas. All 98s were made in Lansing and had the code letter M.|$|E
2500|$|Presented at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show, the Super Trofeo Stradale was {{a limited}} (150 units) {{version of the}} LP570-4 Superleggera. Boasting a dry weight of , it is [...] lighter than a comparably {{equipped}} LP570-4 Superleggera. Essentially a road version of the Super Trofeo race car, equipped with the same adjustable rear spoiler that offers an aerodynamic load 3 {{times that of the}} standard Gallardo LP 560-4 for increased dynamic stability during tight, high-speed driving. Another element taken directly from the racing version was the removable engine hood with quick-release system. The vehicle included Rosso Mars (red) body colour, 6-speed E-gear transmission, carbon fibre and Alcantara interior upholstery with red stitching, double-A-arm suspension, 19-inch wheels, titanium bearing and bolts, Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires. Optional equipment included carbon-ceramic brake discs, a tubular interior roll cage, 4-point safety belts and fire extinguisher, satellite navigation, with Bluetooth connection for mobile phones, an <b>anti-theft</b> system, and a lifting system that raises the front axle, grey or white brake caliper.|$|E
2500|$|Security – Packaging {{can play}} an {{important}} role in reducing the security risks of shipment. [...] Packages can be made with improved tamper resistance to deter manipulation and they can also have tamper-evident features indicating that tampering has taken place. Packages can be engineered to help reduce the risks of package pilferage or the theft and resale of products: [...] Some package constructions are more resistant to pilferage than other types, and some have pilfer-indicating seals. Counterfeit consumer goods, unauthorized sales (diversion), material substitution and tampering can all be minimized or prevented with such anti-counterfeiting technologies. Packages may include authentication seals and use security printing to help indicate that the package and contents are not counterfeit. Packages also can include <b>anti-theft</b> devices such as dye-packs, RFID tags, or electronic article surveillance tags that can be activated or detected by devices at exit points and require specialized tools to deactivate. [...] Using packaging in this way is a means of retail loss prevention.|$|E
2500|$|The newspaper, in an editorial, {{called the}} school's {{decision}} to use the remote-camera feature [...] "misguided", and wrote [...] "families {{had every right to}} be shocked. [...] As an <b>anti-theft</b> strategy, the webcam tracking was overkill–and not even as useful as other means. Then failing to disclose the webcam use was a huge gaffe, compounded by a lack of policies safeguarding students' privacy." [...] Talk radio host and The Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Michael Smerconish added: [...] ost shocking were the [...] showing the faces or … postings of [...] with whom Robbins was communicating. What gave Lower Merion the right to invade the privacy of these people? [...] Their images represent a gross violation of privacy, akin to listening in on a private telephone communication between two individuals, at least one of whom has absolutely no idea of the presence of an interloper. That's the real outrage … it was inexcusable for the school district to invade the privacy of third parties en route to violating that of Blake Robbins.|$|E
2500|$|Sales of the V10 Camry in the US {{began in}} March 1983 after exports commerced in January, and by 1985 it had sold 128,000units. Unlike other markets, federalized quad {{headlamps}} were fitted for the 1983 and 1984 model years. Buyers could specify sedan or liftback bodies with a five-speed manual transmission or extra-cost four-speed automatic paired to the 2.0-liter gasoline 2S-ELC motor rated at [...] Toyota then offered DX (deluxe) and LE (luxury edition) trim levels, the latter adding standard {{features such as}} body-colored bumpers, tachometer, tilt steering wheel, upgraded stereo, electric mirrors and variable intermittent windscreen wipers. Updates for the 1984 model year included an overdrive lockout switch for the automatic transmission. Also optional was the manual-only 1.8-liter 1C-TLC turbo diesel for the DX with , a special gauge cluster, and quieter exhaust system. Changes for 1985 involved the facelift (now with one-piece headlamps), {{the transfer of the}} optional cruise control's switchgear from the dashboard to the wiper stalk, and wider LE-type tires for the DX trim (from [...] ). 1985 cars received gas-charged front shock absorbers and stiffer rear springs, an <b>anti-theft</b> alarm system was now optional on both grades, automatic became an option for the diesel, the DX added a standard tilt steering wheel, and the LE models offered an optional electronic instrument cluster. For 1986, a replacement diesel engine, the automatic-only 2.0-liter 2C-TLC arrived for the DX and LE (...) , and the gasoline model increased power by around [...] Other revisions for this model year were a revised powered brake system and new cloth seat and door trim for LEs.|$|E
2500|$|... 1972 was {{the last}} year for chrome bumpers at both front and rear, the vacuum {{actuated}} pop-up windshield wiper door, as well as the removable rear window common to all 1968-72 coupes. The key activated <b>anti-theft</b> alarm system became standard. The increasingly popular choice of an automatic transmission was installed in most corvettes for the first time, with nearly 54 percent so equipped. This year SAE net measurement for horsepower was now utilized (away from the previous SAE gross standard), and was largely responsible for the much lower engine output figures such as the [...] rating on the standard [...] motor. This was the final year for the LT-1 engine, rated at , and the ZR1 racing package built around it. Although the M22 HD 4-speed was no longer a Regular Production Option, it continued to be fitted to cars outfitted with the ZR1 package. The LT-1 could now be ordered with air conditioning, a combination not permitted the two previous years. The LS5 [...] big block was again available and came in at [...] Noteworthy is in ’72 the LS5 was not available to California buyers. This {{was the beginning of a}} trend where Chevrolet restricted certain power train choices to California buyers due to that state's practice of applying more stringent emission (smog) standards than mandated by federal regulations. Convertibles were a vanishing breed by ‘72, and the Stingray was no exception. It sold only 6,508 copies, amounting to 9% of the market, placing it number three; it was beaten by the number one-selling , with 11,571, but beat the Impala's 6,456 and the Mustang's 6,401. Rare options: ZR1 special engine package (20), shoulder belts with convertibles (749), LT1 engine option (1,741).|$|E
2500|$|For 1968, {{both the}} Corvette body and {{interior}} were completely redesigned. As before, {{the car was}} available in either coupe or convertible models, but coupe was now a notchback fitted with a near-vertical removable rear window and removable roof panels (T-tops). A soft folding top was included with convertibles, while an auxiliary hardtop with a glass rear window was offered at additional cost. Included with coupes were hold down straps {{and a pair of}} vinyl bags to store the roof panels, and above the luggage area was a rear window stowage tray. The enduring new body's concealed headlights moved into position via a vacuum operated system rather than electrically as on the previous generation, and the new hide-away windshield wipers utilized a problematic vacuum door. The door handles were flush with the top of the doors with a separate release button. Front fenders had functional engine cooling vents. Side vent windows were eliminated from all models, replaced with [...] "Astro Ventilation", a fresh air circulation system. In the cabin, a large round speedometer and matching tachometer were positioned in front of the driver. Auxiliary gauges were clustered above the forward end of the console and included oil pressure, water temperature, ammeter, fuel gauge, and an analog clock. A fiber-optic system appeared on the console that monitored exterior lights and there was no glove box. The battery was relocated from the engine area to one of three compartments behind the seats to improve weight distribution. New options included a rear window defroster, <b>anti-theft</b> alarm system, bright metal wheel covers, and an AM-FM Stereo radio. All cars ordered with a radio, like the C2 cars, continued to be fitted with chrome-plated ignition shielding covering the distributor to reduce interference.|$|E
2500|$|... 1979 saw the crossed-flag emblems on {{the nose}} and fuel door revert to those seen on the '77 model. Three popular {{features}} introduced on the '78 pace car replicas made it into this year’s production: the new bucket seats, {{the front and rear}} spoiler package, and the glass roof panels. The new lightweight “high back” seats were made standard equipment. The new seats had better side bolster, provided easier access to the rear storage area, and the seat pair resulted in a weight reduction of about 24pounds. The bolt-on front and rear spoilers were offered as an option and nearly 7,000 cars were ordered so equipped. Functionally, the spoilers decreased drag by about 15% and increased fuel economy by about a half-mile per gallon. A bigger hit were the glass mirror-tint roof panels, now a regular option, with nearly 15,000 cars so fitted despite their costing $365. All T-tops were now wired into the standard <b>anti-theft</b> alarm system. Tungsten-halogen high-beam headlights became standard as did an AM-FM radio, {{and for the first time}} a cassette tape player could be added as a $234 option. Heavy duty shock absorbers could now be ordered without the full Gymkhana suspension. An auxiliary electric engine cooling fan was first installed, but only on L-82 equipped cars with air conditioning. Rocker panels and rear window trim were painted black. Output for all engines increased due to new [...] "open flow" [...] mufflers. The dual-snorkel air intake introduced on L-82 cars the previous year was now fitted to all cars and the base engine now generated [...] The optional L-82 engine increased to [...] This was the final year a manual gearbox could be ordered with the L-82 engine. This was also the last year for the M21 close-ratio 4-speed, a gearbox that, as in previous years, required the optional L-82 engine. A wide-ratio 4-speed was available for all cars. Noteworthy is that about 82% of the cars were ordered with manual transmissions in 1968. In '79, less than 20% of the cars were delivered with manual gearboxes. This year reached an all-time high in Corvette popularity. Production hit its peak in 1979 at 53,807, a record that stands to this day.|$|E
