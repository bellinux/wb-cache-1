5|$|The Era of Martyrs (Latin: anno martyrum or AM), {{also known}} as the Diocletian era (Latin: anno Diocletiani), is a method of {{numbering}} years used by the Church of Alexandria beginning in the 4th century <b>anno</b> <b>Domini</b> and by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria from the 5th century to the present. In this system of counting, the beginning of Diocletian's reign in 284 was used as the epoch, making Diocletian's first year in power into the Year 1 of that calendar. Western Christians were aware of this count but did not use it; Dionysius Exiguus replaced the anno Diocletiani era with his <b>anno</b> <b>Domini</b> era because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The <b>anno</b> <b>Domini</b> era became dominant in the Latin West but was not used in the Greek East until modern times.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} Bede wrote the Historia Ecclesiastica, {{there were two}} common ways of {{referring}} to dates. One was to use indictions, which were 15-year cycles, counting from 312 AD. There were three different varieties of indiction, each starting on a different day of the year. The other approach was to use regnal years—the reigning Roman emperor, for example, or the ruler of whichever kingdom was under discussion. This meant that in discussing conflicts between kingdoms, the date {{would have to be}} given in the regnal years of all the kings involved. Bede used both these approaches on occasion, but adopted a third method as his main approach to dating: the <b>Anno</b> <b>Domini</b> method invented by Dionysius Exiguus. Although Bede did not invent this method, his adoption of it, and his promulgation of it in De Temporum Ratione, his work on chronology, is the main reason why it is now so widely used. Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle, contained in De Temporum Ratione, was developed from Dionysius Exiguus’ famous Easter table.|$|E

In this same history, he also used another Latin term, ante vero incarnationis dominicae tempus anno sexagesimo ("in fact in the 60th year before the time of the Lord's incarnation"), equivalent to the English [...] "before Christ", to identify years before the first year of this era. [...] Both Dionysius and Bede regarded <b>Anno</b> <b>Domini</b> as beginning at the incarnation of Jesus, but [...] "the distinction between Incarnation and Nativity was not drawn until the late 9th century, when in some places the Incarnation epoch was identified with Christ's conception, i.e., the Annunciation on March 25" [...] (Annunciation style).|$|E
