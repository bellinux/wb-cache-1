50|$|The Wolf {{consists}} of a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Ford F-550 chassis modified by Manning Equipment, an OEM up-fitter located in Louisville, KY {{so it can be}} easily maintained anywhere. It is equipped with a diesel, 6 litre 325 HP engine and automatic 5 speed transmission. It can weigh up to 8 tonnes. The automotive systems require no changes when the armor is applied. The armor protects crew compartment, <b>automotive</b> <b>elements</b> and wheels. The armor envelope is built independently from the chassis, so it is possible to use the same armor envelope on another chassis (of the same model) when the chassis goes out for service.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{production}} system and management used in automotive industry. Just-In-Time (JIT) production system is originates from Japan and claimed {{as one of}} the best production system that leads Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) {{as one of the}} best car manufacturer in the world. Even there have been a lot of studies related to JIT production system in automotive industry globally; there is still lack of evidence that Malaysia automotive industry is practicing this remarkable production system. Because of that, this study conducted to explore and figure out on JIT implementation in Malaysia automotive industry. This study started on reviewing elements suggested by literature that are considered important to ensure the successfulness of JIT implementation in an organization. These identified elements then used in investigation of JIT implementation in Malaysia automotive industry. A set of questionnaire designed based on activities that related to elements figured in order to further investigate of JIT implementation in an organization. This questionnaire then distributed randomly to automotive companies all over Malaysia. All data then collected and tested by using a well-known statistical test, a Chi-Square test. Chi-Square test used to find the relationship between elements and activities with types of industry practices in Malaysia <b>automotive</b> industry. These <b>elements</b> are then analyzed and decided either independent or dependent on types of industry. The findings are then summarized with some recommendations suggested to automotive company that is planning to implement JIT in their organization...|$|R

40|$|Glass {{is one of}} {{the most}} common types of trace {{evidence}} found at crime scenes and on suspects. The elemental analysis of float glass has become increasingly important as the range in values of refractive index has substantially narrowed due to increased quality control in glass manufacture. The purpose of this research was to investigate the variation of <b>elements</b> in <b>automotive</b> float glass relevant to New Zealand for the purpose of classifying and discriminating samples. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) was used to analyse the elemental composition of 243 automotive glass samples. An intact side window (tempered pane) and an intact windscreen (laminated pane) were analysed to investigate the spatial trend of <b>elements</b> in <b>automotive</b> glass. Most <b>elements</b> displayed no spatial variation over the panes. Pb had the largest variation in the windscreen and was also found to have a large variation in the database. Most samples were able to be classified into the vehicles' country of origin using a multiclass classifier. However, this was not possible for all samples, due to the origin of glass differing from the origin of the vehicle in some cases. The elemental composition of Australian and Northern Hemisphere samples differed greatly making them easy to separate; however, there was little variation within the Australian samples, making it hard to discriminate between different samples. A three step method, which combined the use of elemental composition, △RI and RI, was used to discriminate database samples. The method distinguished 84 % (172 / 204) of samples in the database. When Australian samples were removed from the analysis, the discrimination increased to 95 % (148 / 156). The type II errors were reduced by using both elemental composition and RI measurement...|$|R
40|$|ESP] La búsqueda de grupos adimensionales de cualquier problema de ciencias o ingeniería constituye un objetivo esencial para el investigador ya que simplifica enormemente su trabajo al reducir el número de parámetros independientes de los que depende su solución a los llamados grupos o números (también monomios) adimensionales. Estos monomios están constituidos por agrupaciones de una parte del conjunto total de parámetros, {{magnitudes}} físicas y variables que intervienen en el problema. Esta reducción está basada formalmente en el hecho de que la solución de cualquier sistema de ecuaciones de gobierno que se constituye en el modelo matemático de un determinado fenómeno sujeto a leyes físicas, {{puede ser}} descrita mediante una relación entre monomios adimensionales. El primer paso para realizar la adimensionalización es elegir las magnitudes de referencia que permiten definir las variables adimensionales (una o más variables dependientes, según se trate de problemas acoplados o desacoplados, y una sola variable independiente). Las referencias, obviamente, son magnitudes con la misma dimensión que las correspondientes variables que convierten en adimensionales. En la adimensionalización clásica, éste es el único requisito que se impone, y dado que en general pueden existir diferentes opciones para elegir estas referencias, según se elija una u otra, los grupos adimensionales resultantes se expresan de diferente modo y poco se puede afirmar sobre su significado físico ni sobre su potencial valor u orden de magnitud. En primer lugar, parece conveniente elegir referencias de modo que el rango de variación del valor numérico de las variables adimensionales (dependientes e independientes) que definen sea el mismo o muy similar. Si este rango cubre el intervalo numérico [0 - 1] hablaremos de variables adimensionales normalizadas. La normalización permite asumir que una vez establecida la ecuación o ecuaciones adimensionales, por sustitución de las variables dimensionales por sus correspondientes adimensionales, los factores de sus sumandos (términos de las ecuaciones) formados por las variables adimensionales y sus cambios (o derivadas) son de orden de magnitud unidad en primera aproximación. Simplificadas las ecuaciones por eliminación de estos factores, lo que queda es una suma de términos o coeficientes formados por parámetros físicos y geométricos del problema, suma en la que todos los términos deben ser del mismo orden en tanto que se balancean entre sí en la nueva ecuación. Los cocientes entre estos coeficientes son los grupos adimensionales (discriminados) del problema, grupos con dos propiedades importantes: tienen un orden de magnitud unidad y pueden interpretarse físicamente como cociente de magnitudes que se balancean en la ecuación o ecuaciones de gobierno del problema. Merced a que los grupos adimensionales, tanto los que contienen incógnitas como los que no, son del orden de magnitud unidad, cuando se ha realizado la adimensionalización en forma normalizada, es obvio que la función arbitraria que los relaciona en la expresión de la solución del problema también ha de ser del orden de magnitud unidad. Este es un aspecto sobre el que se hace hincapié en las aplicaciones. Así, la modulación del orden de magnitud de un monomio dependiente por la función arbitraria de los grupos independientes es relativa, y el valor del proceso de adimensionalización normalizada se revela importante, pues un orden de magnitud unidad para los grupos dependientes es ya una información valiosa con independencia de la existencia o no de grupos independientes en el problema. Finalmente, el orden de magnitud de las incógnitas se obtiene de la solución de los monomios con incógnitas. [ENG] A large variety {{of mechanical engineering}} problems with two or more freedom degrees are formulated by coupled, ordinary differential equations and system of them with time as the independent variable. Translational components of machines are formed by springs and dampers, mobile masses jointed by a spring, sets of masses and pulleys and <b>automotive</b> suspension <b>elements,</b> as well as rotational components, such as aircraft engine and propeller, and shaft and gear systems, are typical examples {{of this kind of}} problems. These problems also emerge in other fields of engineering such as electrochemical processes and convection heat transfer. The behaviour of ecosystems with several interaction predator-prey species governed by population dynamic models of Lotka-Volterra type are also problems formulated by coupled ordinary differential equations in which we are interested to be modelled. Most of these problems are non-lineal or even chaotic, since they contain addends with time harmonic dependencies or with potential functions of the dependent variables, and have, usually, to be solved by numerical analysis. However, there is a procedure which contributes information about the solutions of this kind of problems within a good approximation. The nondimensionalization of the governing equations of a physical problem is a known method, currently used in engineering for extracting the dimensionless groups that influence the solution of a large variety of complex problems, since any equation or system of equations that contain mathematical formulation of laws determining a physical phenomenon can be represented as a relation between dimensionless quantities. This is applied to all kind of mathematical models, partial derivative or ordinary differential equations. In most of books of heat transfer and fluid dynamics, this procedure is explained as one of the applications of dimensional analysis by which the researcher can reach qualitative information with little mathematical effort. In the scientific literature, the procedure is also applied in complex phenomena ruled by coupled partial differential equations. However, both textbooks and scientific literature, usually give short shrift the technique of nondimensionalization when deals with the study of coupled or not, ordinary differential equations. To nondimensionalize an equation or boundary condition, we must firstly select characteristic or reference quantities, which may appear or not explicitly in the statement of the problem or be implicit {{in the evolution of the}} physical phenomenon involved, that best describe it in order to define the dimensionless dependent and independent variables. The choice of these references, a critical step in the nondimensionalization method, requires a thorough study up to a deep understanding of the physical meaning of the terms involved both in governing equation and boundary conditions. As regards the dependent variables, this choice must not be arbitrary, but they must have an inherent physical meaning related to their respective dimensional variable or equation. As for independent variables, against the current use, the references may be different for each one of the coupled equations. This is a kind of discrimination, a concept very productive in the search of dimensionless groups. Generally, the references are not explicit in the statement of the problem–particularly, those related to the independent variables–and are just the unknowns looked for in the nondimensionalization process. Another point of interest in this process, not always possible, refers to an interesting requirement that can be demanded to the references. This is that the range of values of the dimensionless variables they define must expand the interval [0 - 1]. This, in turn, forces the changes in the variables and their derivatives to be, in first approximation, of an order of magnitude unity–unless the nonlinearities of the problem were very sharp. As we will see, this requirement provides an order of magnitude unity to the dimensionless groups. Once the dimensionless variables are defined, they are introduced in the governing equations allowing the dimensionless groups be derived following a simple mathematical protocol. The terms of the dimensionless governing equations are formed by two factors: one is a grouping of parameters, constants and physical characteristics of the problem and the other, a function of the dimensionless variables and their changes. Since the last factor is of an order of magnitude unity in all the terms of the equation, the rest of the factors are also of the same order of magnitude–not necessarily unity–, and the ratios between them, just the dimensionless groups in which we are interested, of an order of magnitude unity...|$|R
