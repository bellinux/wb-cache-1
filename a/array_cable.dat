40|$|The Surface Suspended Acoustic Receiver (SSAR) is a free-drifting {{platform}} {{intended for}} use as a receiver in large scale acoustic tomography experiments. Early prototypes of the SSAR exhibited very poor signal-to-noise ratios in the frequency band of the hydrophones. This thesis details efforts to reduce the hydrophone noise level by combining the analysis of experimental data with the results from numerical models. Experiments were conducted to quantify both the frequency content and magnitude of noise generated on the SSAR. Through a program of sea trials and pond testing, two noise sources were identified. The dominant source of noise in the SSAR is velocity dependent flow noise that results from turbulent pressure fluctuations on the hydrophones. A second noise source results from the acceleration sensitivity of the hydrophones in conjunction with high frequency accelerations present in the hydrophone <b>array</b> <b>cable.</b> These high frequency accelerations also show a velocity dependence. The presence of the acceleration-induced noise leads to correlations between the signals from adjacent hydrophones, thus distorting the typical picture that flow noise should be uncorrelated along an array. The primary methods of eliminating the noise are encapsulating the hydrophone in a flow shield, eliminating the <b>array</b> <b>cable,</b> and slowing the system down by replacing the wave following surface buoy with a spar buoy. Using the experimental results, empirical relationships between hydrophone velocity and expected noise level are formed for both shielded and unshielded hydrophones. The numerical models developed as a part of this effort are then used to predict the velocities {{for a wide range of}} possible SSAR configurations. The models can also provide information, such as system tensions, that is useful in evaluating the longevity and survivability of SSARs. Modeled design fixes include subsurface component changes as well as comparing a wave following surface buoy to a spar buoy. by Jason I. Gobat. Thesis (M. S.)

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. Application of semiconductor photocatalysis in a fixed-bed fiber-optic bundled <b>array</b> <b>cable</b> reactor (OFR) for the purification of contaminated water is investigated in this thesis. An {{optical fiber cable}} is employed {{as a means of}} light transmission and distribution to solid-supported TiO 2. The system is designed for remote delivery of light to the photocatalyst, to allow for measurement of light fluxes for direct determination of quantum yields and for reuse of the reactor to test various coatings and light input angles, and to minimize possible heat build-up and delamination problems. Experiments are carried out to determine the operational factors affecting the chemical efficiency of the OFR system. The uniformity and extent of light propagation down the fiber, the degree of light absorption by the TiO 2 coating, the fiber diameter, the input light intensity, and the ability of the chemical substrates to diffuse into the TiO 2 coating are determined to be important parameters. In addition, a TiO 2 coating that minimizes the interfacial surface area of the quartz core and TiO 2 particles and operation with incident irradiation angles near 90 ° enhance light propagation down the fibers. Relative quantum efficiencies in the OFR are found to be comparable to slurry-phase photochemical reaction systems. The OFR is shown to effectively degrade several model chemical contaminants such as pentachlorophenol (PCP), 4 -chlorophenol (4 CP), dichloroacetate (DCA), and oxalate (OX) under varying reaction conditions. Relatively high quantum efficiencies of [ [...] . ] = 0. 010, 0. 015, 0. 08, and 0. 17, respectively, and complete mineralization to CO 2, H 2 O and HCl are observed. When iron(III) -doped quantum-sized (Q) TiO 2 (Fe/Q-TiO 2) is used as a photocatalytic coating, the extent of linear light transmission in a single fiber is doubled relative to Degussa P 25. However, the Fe/Q-TiO 2 coating is found to have inferior light absorption properties and chemical reactivity leading to lower relative quantum efficiencies. A concentrating, solar powered prototype OFR is designed and tested. Photoefficiencies with sunlight were comparable to that achieved with a Xe-arc source. Lower light intensity-to-photocatalytic surface area ratios result in increased relative quantum efficiencies. A mathematical model of a fiber-optic bundled array reactor system is developed using Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics and compared to experimental data. A global quantum efficiency, [ [...] . ], is defined and used as a model fitting parameter. It incorporates reaction parameters such as the absorbed light intensity, the intrinsic rate constant, and the effects of other adsorbed reactants and reaction intermediates. An empirical term to describe the radiation field within the coated fiber is derived and normalized by the coating photocatalyst particle concentration to account for the inverse relationship between the absorbed light intensity and the reaction quantum efficiency. The [ [...] . ] is determined to be independent of the absorbed light intensity and calculated values are in excellent agreement with experimental values. An analysis of conventional and advanced remediation technologies is performed (Appendix). The chemistry and engineering behind advanced oxidation systems is reviewed, and a means of technical evaluation and comparison is presented. The "electrical energy per order," or EEO is defined as the electrical energy required to reduce the concentration of a given pollutant by one order of magnitude in 1000 gal of water. The EEO can be used to compare the efficacy of remediation technologies with other AOT's and conventional systems for a particular cleanup application...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study aims to {{contribute}} to an improved understanding of the environmental implications of offshore power grid and wind power development pathways. To achieve this aim, we present two assessments. First, we investigate the impacts of a North Sea power grid enabling enhanced trade and integration of offshore wind power. Second, we assess {{the benefit of the}} North Sea grid and wind power through a comparison of scenarios for power generation in affected countries. Methods: The grid scenario explored in the first assessment is the most ambitious scenario of the Windspeed project, and is the result of cost minimization analysis using a transmission expansion planning model. We develop a hybrid life cycle inventory for <b>array</b> <b>cables,</b> HVDC links and substations. The functional unit is 1 kWh of electricity transmitted. The second assessment compares two different energy scenarios of Windspeed for the North Sea and surrounding countries. Here we utilize life cycle inventory for offshore grid components together with inventory for a catalog of power generation technologies from Ecoinvent, and couple these inventories with grid configurations and electricity mixes determined by the optimization procedure in Windspeed. Results and discussion: Developing, operating and dismantling the grid cause emissions of 2. 5 g CO 2 -Eq per kWh electricity transmission, or 36 Mt CO 2 -Eq in total. HVDC cables are the major cause of environmental damage, causing for example half of total climate change effects. The next most important contributors are substations and <b>array</b> <b>cabling</b> used in offshore wind parks. Toxicity and eutrophication effects stem largely from leakages from disposed copper and iron mine tailings and overburden. Results from the comparison of two scenarios demonstrate a substantial environmental benefit from North Sea grid extension and the associated wind power development compared to an alternative generation of electricity from fossil fuels. Offshore grid and wind power, however, entail an increased use of metals and hence a higher metal depletion indicator. Conclusions: We present the first life cycle assessment of a large offshore power grid, using results of an energy planning model as input. HVDC links are the major cause of environmental damage. There are differences across impact categories with respect to which components or types of activities that are responsible for damage. North Sea grid and wind power are environmentally beneficial by an array of criteria if displacing fossil fuels, but cause substantial metal use.    </p...|$|R

It has undergone extensive revisions and updates [NASA JSC HITF website; Christiansen et al., 1992, 1997]. NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) has applied BUMPER to risk assessments for Space Station, Shuttle, Mir, Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMU) space suits, and other spacecraft (e. g., LDEF, Iridium, TDRS, and Hubble Space Telescope). Bumper continues to be updated with changes in the ballistic limit equations describing failure threshold of various spacecraft components, as well as changes in the meteoroid and debris environment models. Significant efforts are expended to validate Bumper and benchmark it to other meteoroid/debris risk assessment codes. Bumper 3 is a refactored version of Bumper II. The structure of the code was extensively modified to improve maintenance, performance and flexibility. The architecture was changed to separate the frequently updated ballistic limit equations from the relatively stable common core functions of the program. These updates allow NASA to produce specific editions of the Bumper 3 that are tailored for specific customer requirements. The core consists of common code necessary to process the Micrometeoroid and Orbital Debris (MMOD) environment models, assess shadowing and calculate MMOD risk.
