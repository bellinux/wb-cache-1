40|$|Accuracy of a five-axis CNC {{machine tool}} is {{affected}} by {{a vast number of}} error sources. This paper investigates volumetric error modeling and its compensation to the basis for creation of new tool path for improvement of work pieces accuracy. The volumetric error model of a five-axis machine tool with the configuration RTTTR (tilting head B-axis and rotary table in work piece side A΄) was set up taking into consideration rigid body kinematics and homogeneous transformation matrix, in which 43 error components are included. Volumetric error comprises 43 error components that can separately reduce geometrical and dimensional <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> pieces. The machining <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> piece is guaranteed due to the position of the cutting tool center point (TCP) relative to the work piece. The cutting tool is deviated from its ideal position relative to the work piece and machining error is experienced. For compensation process detection of the present tool path and analysis of the RTTTR five-axis CNC machine tools geometrical error, translating current position of component to compensated positions using the Kinematics error model, converting newly created component to new tool paths using the compensation algorithms and finally editing old G-codes using G-code generator algorithm have been employed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this research, {{sub-region}} curing and mask DPI modification {{are used}} to improve the accuracy of MPSL. Because the curing shrinkage at the discrete region does not cause the shrinkage of the entire resin surface, {{the accuracy of the}} RP work piece under sub-regional MPSL can be improved effectively.

The research results show that <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> piece less than 12 mm can be improved through DPI (Dot per Inch) modification.

40|$|This is {{a report}} on the {{accuracy}} of machining which is changed by a rise in temperature of main spindle. The machine tool and cutters used in this experiment were a bed-type milling machine and end mills made of high speed steel respectively. The following conclusions were obtained. 1. In the case of high revolution number, the temperature of main spindle has risen remarkably for an hour. Since a dislocation of main spindle and a error of cutting surface increase with rise in temperature of it, a predrive is required. 2. The predrive had better be done in higher revolution number than used cutting condition. In this experiment, the revolution number of predrive is two times as many rotations as that of main spindle used, so that <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> obtained by predrive only twenty minutes is sufficientl...|$|E
