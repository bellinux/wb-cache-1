50|$|As {{the port}} neared completion, Forrest lobbied the British to have Fremantle as {{the port of}} call for the <b>Mail</b> <b>Packets.</b> Victoria and New South Wales fought for the {{retention}} of Albany as the <b>Mail</b> <b>Packet</b> port, as they were fearful they would lose business. Forrest threatened Western Australia may {{stay out of the}} proposed federation of Australian colonies unless they agreed. On 3 August 1900, Forrest won when the Postmaster-General in London informed the Post Master-General in Perth that Fremantle would be substituted for Albany as the port of call for <b>Mail</b> <b>Packets.</b> Ten days later the Orient Steam Navigation Company's RMS Ormuz, homeward bound from Sydney to London, was the first British mail carrier to enter and berth in Fremantle Harbour. In 1901 Fremantle surpassed Albany {{for the first time in}} total tonnage of ships and the following year in the number of ships when it cleared 410 ships (1,045,170 tons) to Albany's 248 ships (540,910 tons).|$|R

Domestic <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> became obsolete in 1975, and international <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> in 1995, when the USPS began transporting First-Class <b>mail</b> by <b>air</b> on a routine basis.|$|R
50|$|The Post Office <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> contract, {{controlled}} by Postmaster General Walter Folger Brown, {{went to their}} rival company Eastern Air Transport (EAT) for 89 cents a mile - over three times what Ludington bid.

This inflated <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> contract and takeover of Ludington Airline by EAT started an investigation that became known as the <b>Air</b> <b>Mail</b> scandal.|$|R
50|$|With the {{establishment}} of the first air-mail route in 1918, and the later additional routes, plus the accepted use of premium priced <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> by the public, it was only natural that the Railway Mail Service (RMS), being in charge of transit mail, was assigned the task of establishing <b>Air</b> <b>Mail</b> Field (AMF) postal facilities at the major airports. Only outgoing <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> was distributed at these workrooms, channeled there by both the post offices and Railway Post Office (RPO) routes. This mail was distributed and dispatched to other AMFs via the different flight connections. Incoming mail from other AMFs was distributed by general scheme and pouched to outgoing RPOs and necessary post offices. The Motor Vehicle Service provided frequent trips between the city post office and the AMF for <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> ground transportation. In 1951, there were 1200 clerks manning forty AMFs. They continue to exist within the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and are now called <b>Air</b> <b>Mail</b> Centers (AMCs).|$|R

50|$|In 1934, {{following}} a Congressional investigation of how <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> contracts had been awarded by the United States Postal Service, President Franklin D. Roosevelt cancelled all existing <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> contracts and assigned {{the duty of}} flying the <b>mail</b> to the <b>Air</b> Corps. The squadron began flying its P-12s on <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> routes, but they proved unsuitable for the work, lacking instruments to fly at night or in adverse weather. Moreover, they could only carry about 50 lbs of mail, and with the mail load, the planes were tail heavy and difficult to fly. The P-12s were withdrawn from the project within a week, although the larger observation aircraft continued to fly mail until May, when new <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> contracts were awarded.|$|R
