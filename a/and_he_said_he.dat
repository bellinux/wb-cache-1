Naoto Kan took an increasingly anti-nuclear stance {{in the months following}} the Fukushima disaster. In May, he ordered that the aging Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant be closed over earthquake and tsunami fears, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would freeze plans to build new reactors.|$|E
25|$|Sage {{stated that}} on Sunday afternoon, July 22, Dillinger {{asked her if}} she {{wanted to go to the}} show with them, he and Polly.She asked him what show was he going to see, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would 'like to see the theater around the corner,' meaning the Biograph Theater. She stated she was unable to leave the house to inform Purvis or Martin about Dillinger's plans to attend the Biograph, but as they were going to have fried chicken for the evening meal, she told Polly she had nothing in which to fry the chicken, and was going to the store to get some butter; that while at the store she called Mr. Purvis and {{informed}} him of Dillinger's plans to attend the Biograph that evening, at the same time obtaining the butter. She then returned to the house so Polly would not be suspicious that she went out to call anyone.|$|E
25|$|In March 1982 {{he worked}} in Modena, Italy, and from November, Basquiat worked from the ground-floor display and studio space Larry Gagosian had built below his Venice, California, home and {{commenced}} a series of paintings for a 1983 show, his second at Gagosian Gallery, then in West Hollywood. He brought along his girlfriend, then unknown aspiring singer Madonna. Gagosian recalls, “Everything was going along fine. Jean-Michel was making paintings, I was selling them, and {{we were having a}} lot of fun. But then one day Jean-Michel said, ‘My girlfriend is coming to stay with me.’ I was a little concerned-one too many eggs can spoil an omelet, you know? So I said, ‘Well, what’s she like?’ <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>He</b> said, ‘Her name is Madonna and she’s going to be huge.’ I’ll never forget that he said that. So Madonna came out and stayed for a few months and we all got along like one big, happy family.” During this time he took considerable interest in the work that Robert Rauschenberg was producing at Gemini G.E.L. in West Hollywood, visiting him on several occasions and finding inspiration in the accomplishments of the painter. In 1982, Basquiat worked briefly with musician and artist David Bowie.|$|E

500|$|As part {{of press}} junkets {{promoting}} the album, Idol reportedly insisted attending journalists {{be familiar with}} cyberpunk fiction. It was also revealed that Idol was not entirely as familiar with the genre as he had proclaimed. William Gibson reported in an interview, [...] "A London journalist told me when Billy did his 'Cyberpunk' press junket over there, he made it a condition of getting an interview with him, that every journalist had to have read Neuromancer...Anyway, they all did but when they met with Billy, {{the first thing that}} became really apparent was that Billy hadn't read it.

500|$|Having {{attracted}} a following {{outside of his}} former mainstream audience, Ice began recording independently, despite still being signed at Universal. During a recording session, Ice met the all-female American hard rock band from Southern California, Betty Blowtorch. The late Bianca Halstead bonded with Ice {{and asked if he}} wanted to contribute a rap interlude to their track Size Queen. On Ice's collaboration with the band, lead vocalist and bassist Halstead was quoted saying [...] "I asked him if he could rap over [...] <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> can rap over anything.

[...] Per his stepfather's request, Ice started working with his former manager Tommy Quon again, while hoping to re-create some of the magic that they worked hard on in the early 1990s, Ice denied any interest in trying to become big again and that his only passion was music, not fame.|$|E

500|$|Writer Rob LaZebnik {{told the}} New York Post that the episode was {{inspired}} by his son Johnny, who came out as gay while at high school: [...] "I am a Midwestern guy, so I don’t tend to wear my emotions on my sleeve, but I thought, 'What better way to tell my son I love him than to write a cartoon about it?'". He added that he pitched the storyline three years earlier, and got approval for his script from his son. Smithers' coming out is low-key, as was Johnny's; he told the Post that as he was [...] "the gayest little kid", his parents were not surprised by his sexual orientation. The episode aired five days before Johnny's 22nd birthday, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would have a viewing party because the episode would be [...] "particularly meaningful" [...] to him. The elder LaZebnik stated his opinion that LGBT-related television can have a [...] "real impact on people's thinking".|$|E
500|$|On 3 March 1910 Troy Middleton enlisted {{into the}} 29th Infantry Regiment at Fort Porter in Buffalo, New York. [...] He {{was put to}} work as a company clerk, and as a private earned $15 a month, which was paid in gold until it became scarce, and was then paid in silver. [...] Private Middleton tired of this desk work quickly and asked to become a soldier. While this did not happen at Fort Porter, his talents as a {{football}} player became known, and he was pressed into duty as the quarterback of the local team, which played civilian teams in the Buffalo area as well as other army teams such as the one at Fort Niagara near Niagara Falls. [...] For the next several years Middleton would play a lot of football, a sport that was strongly endorsed by the army. After getting a commission, an officer is never returned to the same unit from which he served as an enlisted member, but Middleton became the exception because of his talents as a quarterback. Middleton felt that football provided him with the finest training he received while in the army, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> never met a good football player who wasn't also a good soldier.|$|E
500|$|Page also {{suggested}} Cat Power's {{cover of the}} song [...] "Sea of Love", which Reitman was hesitant to include as {{it had already been}} featured in the 1989 film Sea of Love; however, he decided that its inclusion would mark a [...] "new take" [...] on the film's cinematic references. Initially, Reitman had conceived of Juno being a fan of glam rock, but rejected it as too inauthentic, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> wanted to construct Juno to be [...] "into music very real and authentic", making her a fan of punk rock, including The Runaways, Patti Smith and Iggy Pop and the Stooges. [...] He felt that the Sonic Youth cover of [...] "Superstar" [...] defined Juno and Mark's relationship—Juno preferring the classic 1971 version by The Carpenters while Mark preferred Sonic Youth's 1994 cover. [...] "A Well Respected Man" [...] by The Kinks was a song Reitman had associated with a character from another of his screenplays and says it was [...] "heart-breaking" [...] when he decided to include the song as an introduction for Paulie instead, despite feeling it suited the scene perfectly. He found children's songwriter Barry Louis Polisar's [...] "All I Want Is You" [...] after [...] "surfing iTunes for hours on end" [...] using different words and names as search terms and thought that the handmade quality was perfect for the opening titles, which were afterwards made to correspond to the song. [...] The [...] "Brunch Bowlz" [...] jingle, Mark writes in the film, was composed by advertisement writer Chris Corley with whom Reitman had previously worked on a set of commercials for Wal-Mart.|$|E

500|$|The first {{volley of}} gunfire killed the Tsar, the Empress and two male servants, and wounded the family's {{doctor and the}} empress' maidservant. Maria tried to escape through the doors {{at the rear of}} the room, which led to a storage area, but the doors were nailed shut. The noise as she rattled the doors {{attracted}} the attention of the drunken military commissar Peter Ermakov. [...] A heavy layer of smoke had accumulated in the room from the gunfire and from plaster dust released from the walls by errant bullets, and the gunmen could see only the lower bodies of those who were still alive. [...] Ermakov fired at Maria, and his bullet struck her in the thigh. She fell to the floor with Anastasia and Demidova and lay there moaning. [...] The assassins then left the room for several minutes to let the haze clear, and when they returned they killed Dr Botkin, Tsarevich Alexei and Grand Duchesses Olga and Tatiana. [...] Ermakov then turned on the wounded Maria and Anastasia, who was still unharmed. He struggled with Maria and tried to stab her with a bayonet. [...] The jewels sewn into her clothes protected her, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> finally shot her in the head. [...] But the skull that is almost certainly Maria's has no bullet wound. [...] Perhaps the drunken Ermakov inflicted a scalp wound, knocking her unconscious and producing a considerable flow of blood, leading Ermakov to think he had killed her. [...] He then struggled with Anastasia, whom he also claimed he shot in the head. [...] As the bodies were being removed from the house, Maria regained consciousness and screamed. Ermakov tried to stab her again but failed, and struck her in the face until she was silent. [...] The facial area of Maria's skull was indeed destroyed, but Yurovsky wrote that the victims' faces were shattered with rifle butts at the burial site. [...] Though Maria unquestionably died with her family, the exact cause of her death remains a mystery.|$|E
