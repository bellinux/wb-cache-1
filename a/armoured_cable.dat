500|$|Rotary {{drilling}} is {{the main}} method of drilling for minerals and {{it has also been}} used for ice drilling. It uses a string of drill pipe rotated from the top, and drilling fluid is pumped down through the pipe and back up around it. [...] The cuttings are removed from the fluid {{at the top of the}} hole and the fluid is then pumped back down. [...] This approach requires long trip times, since the entire drill string must be hoisted out of the hole, and each length of pipe must be separately disconnected, and then reconnected when the drill string is reinserted. [...] Along with the logistical difficulties associated with bringing heavy equipment to ice sheets, this makes traditional rotary drills unattractive. [...] In contrast, wireline drills allow the removal of the core barrel from the drill assembly while it is still at the bottom of the borehole. [...] The core barrel is hoisted to the surface, and the core removed; the barrel is lowered again and reconnected to the drill assembly. [...] Another alternative is flexible drill-stem rigs, in which the drill string is flexible enough to be coiled when at the surface. [...] This eliminates the need to disconnect and reconnect the pipes during a trip.The need for a string of drillpipe that extends from the surface to the bottom of the borehole can be eliminated by suspending the entire downhole assembly on an <b>armoured</b> <b>cable</b> that conveys power to the downhole motor. [...] These cable-suspended drills can be used for both shallow and deep holes; they require an anti-torque device, such as leaf-springs that press against the borehole, to prevent the drill assembly rotating around the drillhead as it cuts the core. [...] The drilling fluid is usually circulated down around the outside of the drill and back up between the core and core barrel; the cuttings are stored in the downhole assembly, in a chamber above the core. [...] When the core is retrieved, the cuttings chamber is emptied for the next run. [...] Some drills have been designed to retrieve a second annular core outside the central core, and in these drills the space between the two cores can be used for circulation. [...] Cable-suspended drills have proved to be the most reliable design for deep ice drilling.|$|E

50|$|Cables {{usually are}} secured with special {{fittings}} where they enter electrical apparatus; {{this may be}} a simple screw clamp for jacketed cables in a dry location, or a polymer-gasketed cable connector that mechanically engages the armour of an <b>armoured</b> <b>cable</b> and provides a water-resistant connection. Special cable fittings may be applied to prevent explosive gases from flowing in the interior of jacketed cables, where the cable passes through areas where flammable gases are present. To prevent loosening of the connections of individual conductors of a cable, cables must be supported near their entrance to devices and at regular intervals along their runs. In tall buildings, special designs are required to support the conductors of vertical runs of cable. Generally, only one cable per fitting is permitted, unless the fitting is rated or listed for multiple cables.|$|E
5000|$|Labour Cost: During {{installation}} MI cable {{must not}} be bent repeatedly as this will cause work hardening and cracks in the cladding and cores. A minimum bend radius must be observed and the cable must be supported at regular intervals. The magnesium oxide insulation is hygroscopic so MICC cable must be protected from moisture until it has been terminated. Termination requires stripping back the copper cladding and attaching a compression gland fitting. Individual conductors are insulated with plastic sleeves. A sealing tape, insulating putty or an epoxy resin is then poured into the compression gland fitting to provide a watertight seal. If a termination is faulty due to workmanship or damage then the magnesium oxide will absorb moisture and lose its insulating properties. Depending on the size and number of conductors, a single termination can take between 1 and 2 hours of labour (an electrician {{should be able to}} make a termination in 10 to 15 minutes on up to 4 core smaller sizes). Installation of a three-conductor MI cable (size No. 10 AWG â€” about 5 square mm) takes about 65% more time than installation of a PVC-sheathed <b>armoured</b> <b>cable</b> of the same conductor size. Installation of MICC is therefore a costly task. Certain PTFE, silicone or other polymer-insulated cables have been substituted in applications which require similar properties in terms of flame spread, which use less labour to terminate. MICC is still used in applications which are particularly suited to its combination of properties.|$|E

IEC 60287 - 1 - 1 gives a strong overestimation of armour and screen power losses and consequently an important underestimation of cable current rating.

40|$|The {{frequency}} {{characteristics of a}} drill cable determines both the type of communication {{that can be used}} between a drill or logger and the surface, as well as the maximum rate of information that can be transferred. In order to revise the design, the attenuation of the cable was measured. The result was far from the characteristics of a coaxial cable. At medium audio frequencies, the attenuation was quite low. However at both low and high frequencies, the attenuation increased significantly, and the high frequency cut off could be approximated by a 3 -order low pass filter with a cut off frequency of 8 kHz. For comparison, the attenuation of a similar size coaxial type cable will be in order of 1 dB/ 300 m at 150 kHz increasing to 2 dB/ 300 m at 1 MHz.

40|$|When single {{armoured}} cables {{are under}} tension they {{will start to}} twist in direction depending on the lay angle of the armour wires on the cable. The cables start to twist due to the induced torque that appear within the cable and this induced torque can in the worst-case cause loops and kinks on the cable. These negative consequences are the subject to exploration by implementing a known analytical solution developed by Lanteigne (1985), into an external function in OrcaFlex which is a finite element software program capable of solving 3 D non-linear arbitrarily deflections. It is specifically designed {{to be used for}} doing static and dynamic analysis on marine and offshore structures. Different cable installation scenarios cases have been created and some of these are validated through experimental testing at the testing facility at ABB, Karlskrona. The results from the different cases shows a good representation of the real twist and rotation of the cable. However, results also conclude that the induced torque that appear within the cable was not possible to be correctly represented by applying external torque from an external function. These results are important for further research within the area and they help creating a greater understanding of torque related problems with single <b>armoured</b> <b>cable</b> under tension...|$|E

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding and {{quantifying}} groundwater {{and surface}} water interactions are key elements for the managementof {{water quality and}} quantity, {{but also for the}} preservation of groundwater dependent ecosystems and riparianhabitat. We developed a methodology to quantify groundwater and surface water interactions, by setting up anactive heat tracer experiment using fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS). The experimental setup consists in heating an <b>armoured</b> fiber-optic <b>cable</b> that has been previously deployedalong the streambed within the sediments. Then, the increase in temperature along the heated cable is a functionof the thermal properties of the sediments and of the fluid flow velocity within the sediments. The cable isheated electrically through the steel armouring of the cable while the elevations in temperature are continuouslymonitored. We tested this methodology on the Kerbernez catchment, located in south-western Brittany (France) and {{which is part of the}} AgrHys hydrological observatory. We deploy the cable in a first-order stream within thissmall agricultural catchment (0. 12 km 2). Temperature was monitored along 60 meters of stream with a spatial andtemporal resolution respectively equal to 29 cm and 30 s. To interpret the data, we used an analytical solutiondeveloped for geothermal energy that considers advection and conduction of temperature in porous media. Tovalidate the use of the analytical solution and to define the limits of the method, a 2 D numerical model has beendeveloped. This model simulates heat transport and conduction with steady state fluid flow using the ConjugateHeat Transfer module of COMSOL MultiphysicsÂ®. During heating and cooling, the measured temperature was particularly variable along the section withtemperature increases that range between 16 to 36 C. This variability can directly be associated with localvariations of water fluxes by applying the appropriate analytical solution. Henceforth, it is possible to modelfield data, just by adjusting one free parameter: the flow velocity within the sediments. For the electrical powerused, these preliminary tests permits to estimate fluxes between groundwater and surface water between 8. 10 ^- 7 to 6. 10 ^- 5 m. s- 1.

40|$|International audienceUnderstand the {{dynamics}} of the fresh-salt water interface in aquifers is a key issue to comprehend mixing processand to quantity the discharge of nutrients in to coastal areas. In order to go beyond the current knowledge inthis issue an experimental site has been set up at the alluvial aquifer Riera Argentona (Barcelona â€“ Spain). Thesite comprises 16 shallow piezometers installed between 30 and 90 m from the seashore, with depths rangingbetween 15 and 25 meters. The seawater interface is being monitored using several techniques, the combinationof which will help us to understand the spatial and temporal behaviour of the mixing zone and the geochemicalprocesses occurring there. Specially the deepest piezometers are equipped with electrodes in order to performcross-hole electrical resistivity tomography (CHERT). In addition, all piezometers are also equipped with FiberOptic cable to perform distributed temperature measurements. Two single steel <b>armoured</b> fibre optic <b>cable</b> lines ofaround 600 m length were installed in all boreholes. The objective is to use the cable both as passive and activetemperature sensor. The first is being done for the continuous monitoring of temperature whereas; the secondprovides a higher temperature resolution used to monitor field experiments. Periodic CHERT measurements are carried out between the piezometer equipped with electrodes, resultingin parallel and perpendicular vertical cross sections of the site resistivity. The position of the fresh-salt waterinterface can be identified due to the resistivity contrast between the saline and fresh water. Preliminary resultsof periodic distributed temperature measurements will be also be used to monitor the position of the mixing zonethanks to the contrast and seasonal temperature changes. Periodic down-hole EC profiles will be used to validatethe method.
