Her father sold his ancestral land to educate her, and worked double shifts to continue to pay for her schooling. In an interview he related that as a youth he had dreamed of becoming a school teacher, but at that time education was not considered important and girls were not even sent to school. [...] "Attitudes are changing back home now, but when I left 30 years ago, I vowed never deny my children so sending them to school was fulfilling my desire for knowledge." [...] He said that he put his daughter's education above that of even his two sons. [...] "It never entered our hearts to ever discriminate. How could I be happy if my son is happy <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> isn't? And it was impossible to refuse a little girl who loved going to school." ...|$|E
500|$|When Elaine finally arrives, she {{explains}} that Kramer promised her a lift if she would wait in his car for two minutes. He returned over twenty minutes later, and the car had been towed for being illegally parked. She was eventually forced {{to walk to the}} restaurant. Alton, returning from the bathroom, greets Elaine and tells Jerry and [...] "chorus boy" [...] George {{that they are going to}} a Pakistani restaurant five blocks away. On their way out, they notice it is snowing. Jerry knows snow would ruin his suede jacket and asks Alton if they can take a cab, but Alton replies that it is only a few blocks away. George suggests that Jerry could turn the jacket inside out, but because of the candy stripe lining, Alton notices and tells him to turn it back, saying he looks [...] "like a damn fool" [...] and that he's [...] "not going to walk down the street with me <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> dressed like that." [...] George then reminds Jerry that the restaurant is only a few blocks away; Jerry, reluctantly, puts his jacket back to normal.|$|E
