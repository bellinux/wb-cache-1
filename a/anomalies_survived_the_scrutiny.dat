They all have slightly different priorities. The Research Council funds projects which demonstrate the highest quality in social science research and which may impact on practice or policy.

In 1993, the FCC was granted the authority to auction spectrum allocation, provided that the FCC ensured the economic opportunity of minority-owned business under such a competitive bidding regulatory regime.

All six hearts had morphologically severe disease with gross right atrial dilation and marked apical displacement of the tricuspid valve. All had a secundum atrial septal defect and four had additional cardiac lesions (pulmonary atresia in two, ventricular septal defect in two). There was significant thinning of the right ventricular free wall distal to the tricuspid valve (3 ± 0. 2 mm vs. control 4. 2 ± 0. 2, p < 0. 01) and right ventricular fiber diameter was reduced (7. 2 ± 0) μm vs. control 11. 4 ± 0. 6, p < 0. 001). The fibrous tissue content of both right and left ventricular free walls was increased (right, 29. 3 ± 2. 6 % vs. control 8. 7 ± 1. 1, p < 0. 091; left, 23. 2 ± 1. 5 % vs. control 8. 5 ± 0. 7 %, p < 0. 001).

By calling for an expansive and flexible analysis and disapproving of the use of rigid formulas in evaluating an invention for obviousness, KSR may appear {{to make it easier for}} generic competitors to challenge the validity of drug patents. But an examination of the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s nonobviousness jurisprudence in the context of such challenges reveals that the Federal Circuit has been employing all along the sort of flexible approach that the Supreme Court admonished it to use in KSR. The decisions of the Federal Circuit considering obviousness challenges to pharmaceuticalp atents suggest that the pharmaceutical industry does indeed have a nonobviousness problem, but that problem is not KSR. Rather, the problem is that many of the patents that the industry relies upon are invalid for obviousness under time-honored patent doctrine. Although perhaps able to <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> limited <b>scrutiny</b> that is possible on the basis of the information available at the prosecution stage, these patents cannot withstand a validity challenge with the benefit of a full evidentiary record at the infringement stage.

40|$|The {{technique}} of appending substantive provisions to appropriations bills {{has become a}} favorite tool of the legislative trade in recent years. Congress has employed appropriations riders to dictate the outcome of public policy issues ranging from abortion to oil development in pristine wilderness areas. Riders have been used with particularly destructive effect to circumvent long-standing environmental policies, especially those involving the use {{of natural resources and}} public lands. In many cases, the policies affected were the result of decades of activity in Congress and in the courts, and retain broad public and legislative support. Appropriations riders have also allowed these significant changes in policy to be made without public input or legislative accountability. The policy changes implemented through the appropriations process would likely not <b>survive</b> <b>the</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of natural resources committees and full floor debate. Appropriations riders have mandated dramatic changes in these carefully brokered policies, with highly disruptive effects on the long-term management and the sustainability of the public lands and natural resources. This Article explores several recent environmental riders and proposed riders, and their likely long-term effects. In particular, it focuses on the effects of the 1995 Rescissions Act [...] specifically the Emergency Timber Salvage Rider 3 [...] on the management of natural resources within federal forest lands in the Pacific Northwest. In an attempt to provide relief to communities dependent on logging of public lands, this rider undermined decades of land management planning and overturned policies developed through extended litigation and negotiations between industry, environmentalists, state and local governments, and the executive branch of the federal government. The cumulative environmental effects of the rider are likely to persist long after the 2 ̆ 2 emergency 2 ̆ 2 indicated by the rider has passed. Yet, because of the abbreviated nature of the appropriations process, neither the public nor the legislators who voted on the timber rider were aware of its potentially far-reaching consequences. This Article argues that the appropriations process is an ill-suited vehicle for formulating major changes in policy and establishing national priorities. Indeed, the repeated abuse of the process to force executive action and, curtail judicial oversight has created a serious crisis. This Article examines several possible remedies, including the possibility of stricter judicial scrutiny of legislation passed by rider, as well as the enactment of line-item veto legislation and legislation that would give congressional germaneness rules (limiting the subject matter of provisions that can be appended to a bill) the force of law. Such legislation may be {{a step in the right}} direction; however, it may raise constitutional challenges, and, in any event, none of these options would go far enough to prevent future legislative subterfuge. Moreover, as a practical matter, the fact that an interest is,deemed a 2 ̆ 2 right 2 ̆ 2 does not necessarily preclude erosion of that right through appropriations riders. ...|$|R

Many papers have studied the Monty Hall anomaly under different perspectives (i. e. computerizing, learning, grouping, talking, and even teaching how to play it), but <b>the</b> <b>anomaly</b> still <b>survives.</b> <b>The</b> most common explanation for this is that subjects are unable to carry out correctly the Bayesian updating necessary. Our approach is different from all previous attempts to explain and correct the Monty Hall anomaly, inasmuch we developed a more radical "debiasing test". Even if the game remains identical in terms of probabilities and subjects task, we eliminate the necessity for any Bayesian updating, as our new framework does not require subjects to make any probability calculations. Consequently, having eliminated the cause, also the effect should have disappeared. In order to make our results robust, we also run an intermediate treatment. Even though we observe an evident monotonic increase in the switching percentage across the three treatments, as we expected (from 41. 5 % in the treatment that replicates the standard design, to 45. 5 % for the intermediate treatment, up to 58 % in the new framework), this percentage remains still too low, even though no Bayesian updating is involved. These results drive us to conclude that this anomaly, even if attenuated by design conditions, is not a weak effect, but rather a systematic behavioural regularity. It could be attributed to some psychological underpinnings, such as the status quo bias. We comment on these, and alternative explanations, in our conclusions.

40|$|From {{a string}} theory {{point of view}} the most natural gauge action on the fuzzy sphere S 2 L is the Alekseev-Recknagel-Schomerus action which is a {{particular}} combination of the Yang-Mills action and the Chern-Simons term. Since the differential calculus on the fuzzy sphere is 3 −dimensional the field content of this model consists naturally of a 2 -dimensional gauge field together with a scalar fluctuation normal to the sphere. For U(1) gauge theory we compute the quadratic effective action and shows explicitly that the tadpole diagrams and the vacuum polarization tensor contain a gauge-invariant UV-IR mixing in the continuum limit L−→ ∞ where L is the matrix size of the fuzzy sphere. In other words the quantum U(1) effective action does not vanish in the commutative limit and a noncommutative <b>anomaly</b> <b>survives.</b> We compute <b>the</b> scalar effective potential and prove the gauge-fixing-independence of the limiting model L = ∞ and then show explicitly that the one-loop result predicts a first order phase transition which was observed recently in simulation [10]. The one-loop result for the U(1) theory is exact in this limit. It is also argued that if we add a large mass term for the scalar mode the UV-IR mixing will be completely removed from the gauge sector. It is found in this case to be confined to the scalar sector only. This is {{in accordance with the}} large L analysis of the model [7]. Finally we show that the phase transition becomes harder to reach starting from small couplings when we increase M. ...|$|R
