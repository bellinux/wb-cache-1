Many historians consider the discovery of artificially produced radionuclides by Frédéric Joliot-Curie and Irène Joliot-Curie in 1934 as the most significant milestone in nuclear medicine. In February 1934, they reported the first artificial production of radioactive material in the journal Nature, after discovering radioactivity in aluminum foil that was irradiated with a polonium preparation. Their work built upon earlier discoveries by Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen for X-ray, Henri Becquerel for radioactive uranium salts, and Marie Curie (mother of Irène Curie) for radioactive thorium, polonium and coining the term [...] "radioactivity." [...] Taro Takemi studied the application of nuclear physics to medicine in the 1930s. The history of nuclear medicine will not be complete without mentioning these early pioneers. Nuclear medicine gained public recognition as a potential specialty on December 7, 1946 when an article was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association by Sam Seidlin. The article described a successful treatment of a patient with thyroid cancer metastases using radioiodine (I-131). This is considered by many historians as the most important article ever published in nuclear medicine. Although the earliest use of I-131 was devoted to therapy of thyroid cancer, its use was later expanded to include imaging of the thyroid gland, quantification of the thyroid function, and therapy for hyperthyroidism. Among the many radionuclides that were discovered for medical-use, none were as important as the discovery and development of Technetium-99m. It was first discovered in 1937 by C. Perrier and E. Segre as an artificial element to fill space number 43 in the Periodic Table. The development of a generator system to produce Technetium-99m in the 1960s became a practical method for medical use. Today, Technetium-99m is the most utilized element in nuclear medicine and is employed {{in a wide variety of}} nuclear medicine imaging studies. Widespread clinical use of nuclear medicine began in the early 1950s, as knowledge expanded about radionuclides, detection of radioactivity, and using certain radionuclides to trace biochemical processes. Pioneering works by Benedict Cassen in developing the first rectilinear scanner and Hal O. Anger's scintillation camera (Anger camera) broadened the young discipline of nuclear medicine into a full-fledged medical imaging specialty.|$|E

We also discuss <b>artificial</b> <b>radionuclide</b> contamination and high natural radioactivity areas. The interpretation of 14 C-, 137 Cs-, and 210 Pb-derived sedimentation rates has provided evidence that inappropriate soil use by urban and agricultural activities has intensified erosion processes on land, which is reflected in depositional environments, such as coastal lagoons, estuaries and mangroves. Of the processes discussed in this paper, SGD is the one that requires the most scientific effort in the short-term. There have been only two case studies using 222 Rn and radium isotopes as groundwater tracers in Brazil. These investigations showed that SGD can be a major source of nutrients and other dissolved species to the coastal ocean.

However, deep sea sediments {{have the potential to}} store and accumulate pollutants, including <b>artificial</b> <b>radionuclides.</b> Deep sea marine sediment cores were collected from Mediterranean Sea abyssal plains (depth > 2000 m) and analysed for 239, 240 Pu and 137 Cs to elucidate the concentrations, inventories and sources of these radionuclides in the deepest areas of the Mediterranean. The activity — depth profiles of 210 Pb, together with 14 C dating, indicate that sediment mixing redistributes the <b>artificial</b> <b>radionuclides</b> within the first 2. 5 cm of the sedimentary column. The excess 210 Pb inventory was used to normalize 239, 240 Pu and 137 Cs inventories for variable sediment fluxes. The 239, 240 Pu/ 210 Pbxs ratio was uniform across the entire sea, with a mean value of 1. 24 × 10 − 3, indicating homogeneous fallout of 239, 240 Pu. The 137 Cs/ 210 Pbxs ratio showed differences between the eastern (0. 049) and western basins (0. 030), clearly significant impact of deep sea sediments from the Chernobyl accident. The inventory ratios of 239, 240 Pu/ 137 Cs were 0. 041 and 0. 025 in the western and eastern basins respectively, greater than the fallout ratio, 0. 021, showing more efficient scavenging of 239, 240 Pu in the water column and major sedimentation of 137 Cs in the eastern basin. Although areas with water depths of > 2000 m constitute around 40 % of the entire Mediterranean basin, the sediments in these regions only contained 2. 7 % of the 239, 240 Pu and 0. 95 % of the 137 Cs deposited across the Sea in 2000.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{presents}} {{an attempt to}} use radionuclide profiles to date four short sediment cores taken from two Chilean lakes located in a highly active geodynamic setting. In such settings, sediment series commonly contain earthquake-triggered reworked layers and/or volcanic ash layers. All of these layers affect the vertical distribution of radionuclides. The drawing up of accurate chronologies is made even more problematic by the low fallout rates of both natural (210 Pb) and artificial (137 Cs, 241 Am) radionuclides. However, radionuclide profiles can be “corrected” by subtracting the influence of instantaneous deposits that have been identified from detailed sedimentological studies. Thus, radionuclides {{can be used to}} provide approximate dates for sediment. Independent confirmation of these dates can be provided by varve counting and/or the recognition of historical events. For Lake Puyehue, this approach has allowed particular sediment features {{to be related to the}} effects of the 1960 Chilean earthquake (Mw 9. 5) on the lake basin and its catchment area. For Lake Icalma, there is a good agreement between radionuclide dates and the dates of the three tephra layers formed during large eruptions of the Llaima volcano in 1946, 1917 and 1883. For both lakes, <b>artificial</b> <b>radionuclide</b> fallout, which culminated in 1965, provides more robust chronological information than 210 Pb dating...|$|E
40|$|For {{the current}} on-site {{evaluation}} of the environmental contamination and contributory external exposure after the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (CNPP) and the nuclear tests at the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Testing Site (SNTS), the concentrations of <b>artificial</b> <b>radionuclides</b> in soil samples from each area were analyzed by gamma spectrometry. Four <b>artificial</b> <b>radionuclides</b> ((241) Am, (134) Cs, (137) Cs, and (60) Co) were detected in surface soil around CNPP, whereas seven <b>artificial</b> <b>radionuclides</b> ((241) Am, (57) Co, (137) Cs, (95) Zr, (95) Nb, (58) Co, and (60) Co) were detected in surface soil around SNTS. Effective doses around CNPP were over the public dose limit of 1 mSv/y (International Commission on Radiological Protection, 1991). These levels in a contaminated area 12 km from Unit 4 were high, whereas levels in a decontaminated area 12 km from Unit 4 and another contaminated area 15 km from Unit 4 were comparatively low. On the other hand, the effective doses around SNTS were below the public dose limit. These {{findings suggest that the}} environmental contamination and effective doses on the ground definitely decrease with decontamination such as removing surface soil, although the effective doses of the sampling points around CNPP {{in the present study were}} all over the public dose limit. Thus, the remediation of soil as a countermeasure could be an extremely effective method not only for areas around CNPP and SNTS but also for areas around the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (FNPP), and external exposure levels will be certainly reduced. Long-term follow-up of environmental monitoring around CNPP, SNTS, and FNPP, as well as {{evaluation of the}} health effects in the population residing around these areas, could contribute to radiation safety and reduce unnecessary exposure to the public...|$|R
40|$|Considering {{the growing}} public concern over marine {{environmental}} quality, {{a program of}} monitoring radionuclids in imported fishery products has been established. The analyses have been performed by gamma spectrometry allowing the rapid detection of many <b>artificial</b> <b>radionuclides</b> such as 137 Cs, 134 Cs and 40 K. The data obtained show Cs radionuclides levels within expected limits. The detection of natural radionuclide K showed different levels in the same fishery product as they came from different sea areas...|$|R
