5|$|About half <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> ago, {{the newly}} {{captured}} star began {{to expand into}} a red giant (see stellar evolution).|$|E
5|$|Even {{before it}} becomes a red giant, the {{luminosity}} of the Sun will have nearly doubled, and Earth will receive as much sunlight as Venus receives today. Once the core hydrogen is exhausted in 5.4 billion years, the Sun will expand into a subgiant phase and slowly double in size over about half <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>years.</b> It will then expand more rapidly over about half <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> until it is over two hundred times larger than today {{and a couple of}} thousand times more luminous. This then starts the red-giant-branch phase where the Sun will spend around <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> and lose around a third of its mass.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{observations}} of the morphology and distribution of galaxies and quasars are {{in agreement with the}} current state of the Big Bang theory. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> after the Big Bang, and since then, larger structures have been forming, such as galaxy clusters and superclusters.|$|E

50|$|At the Paris Conference in 2015 {{where the}} Agreement was negotiated, the {{developed}} countries reaffirmed the commitment to mobilize $100 <b>billion</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> in climate finance by 2020, and agreed to continue mobilizing finance {{at the level of}} $100 <b>billion</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> until 2025. The commitment refers to the pre-existing plan to provide US$100 <b>billion</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> in aid to developing countries for actions on climate change adaptation and mitigation.|$|R
5|$|Highly {{energetic}} {{chemistry is}} thought to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago, and half <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> later the last common ancestor of all life existed. The current scientific consensus is that the complex biochemistry that makes up life came from simpler chemical reactions. The beginning of life may have included self-replicating molecules such as RNA and the assembly of simple cells.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{prominent}} families in the asteroid belt (in order of increasing semi-major axes) are the Flora, Eunoma, Koronis, Eos, and Themis families. The Flora family, one of the largest with more than 800 known members, may have formed from a collision less than <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{effective}} surface temperature of IK Pegasi B {{is estimated to}} be about , making it a strong source of ultraviolet radiation. Under normal conditions this white dwarf would continue to cool for more than <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>years,</b> while its radius would remain essentially unchanged.|$|E
5000|$|The geology {{comprised}} <b>a</b> 2.6 <b>billion</b> <b>year</b> old rock formation altered 1.5 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> {{ago by the}} Grenville Metamorphic Event into granite, one of {{the hardest}} rock types on the planet, excellent armour against a nuclear strike.|$|R

5|$|The first {{form of life}} {{to develop}} on the Earth were microbes, and they {{remained}} the only form of life until about <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> ago when multi-cellular organisms began to appear. Microorganisms are single-celled organisms that are generally microscopic, and smaller than the human eye can see. They include Bacteria, Fungi, Archaea, and Protista.|$|E
5|$|The {{intermediate}} inclinations 60° < i < 140° are {{devoid of}} known moons {{due to the}} Kozai instability. In this instability region, solar perturbations at apoapse cause the moons to acquire large eccentricities that lead to collisions with inner satellites or ejection. The lifetime of moons in the instability region is from 10 million to <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
5|$|Haumea has an {{orbital period}} of 284 Earth years, a {{perihelion}} of 35 AU, and an orbital inclination of 28°. It passed aphelion in early 1992, {{and is currently}} more than 50 AU from the Sun. Haumea's orbit has a slightly greater eccentricity {{than that of the}} other members of its collisional family. This is thought to be due to Haumea's weak 7:12 orbital resonance with Neptune gradually modifying its initial orbit over the course of <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>years,</b> through the Kozai effect, which allows the exchange of an orbit's inclination for increased eccentricity.|$|E
25|$|A {{wormhole}} could connect extremely {{long distances}} such as <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> light <b>years</b> or more, short distances {{such as a}} few meters, different universes, or different points of time.|$|R
50|$|On other issues, the conferees {{were able}} to come to {{agreement}} much more easily. Although the House bill projected spending of $9 <b>billion</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> over three years and the Senate $7 <b>billion</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> over three years, but both sides agreed to cut spending down to $5 billion or $6 <b>billion</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> over three years. The Senate also agreed to ease requirements that states meet certain civil rights and environmental standards, which would allow a number of highway construction projects which had been help up to move forward.|$|R
50|$|The Komatii Formation is <b>a</b> 3.475 <b>billion</b> <b>year</b> old rock formation, {{named after}} the nearby Komati River in South Africa. It is the type {{locality}} for komatiite, a high temperature, Magnesium-rich volcanic rock.|$|R
5|$|Receiving {{light and}} other signals from distant astronomical sources can even take much longer. For example, {{it has taken}} 13billion (13) years for light to travel to Earth from the faraway galaxies viewed in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field images. Those photographs, taken today, capture images of the galaxies as they {{appeared}} 13billion years ago, {{when the universe was}} less than <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> old. The fact that more distant objects appear to be younger, due to the finite speed of light, allows astronomers to infer the evolution of stars, of galaxies, and of the universe itself.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{the outcome}} of the {{continental}} migration, the continued subduction process causes water to be transported to the mantle. After <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> from the present, a geophysical model gives an estimate that 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted. If this process were to continue unmodified into the future, the subduction and release would reach an equilibrium after 65% of the current ocean mass has been subducted.|$|E
5|$|The {{protoplanetary disk}} is an {{accretion}} disk that feeds the central star. Initially very hot, the disk later cools {{in what is}} known as the T tauri star stage; here, formation of small dust grains made of rocks and ice is possible. The grains eventually may coagulate into kilometer-sized planetesimals. If the disk is massive enough, the runaway accretions begin, resulting in the rapid—100,000 to 300,000years—formation of Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos. Near the star, the planetary embryos go through a stage of violent mergers, producing a few terrestrial planets. The last stage takes approximately 100million to <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
40|$|Normally {{one thinks}} of {{the motion of the}} planets around the Sun as a highly {{classical}} phenomenon, so that one can neglect quantum gravity in the Solar System. However, classical chaos in the planetary motion amplifies quantum uncertainties so that they become very large, giving huge quantum gravity effects. For example, evidence suggests that Uranus may eventually be ejected from the Solar System, but quantum uncertainties would make the direction at which it leaves almost entirely uncertain, and the time of its exit uncertain by about <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>billion</b> <b>years.</b> For <b>a</b> time <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> from now, there are huge quantum uncertainties whether Uranus will be within the Solar System, within the Galaxy, or even within causal contact of the Galaxy...|$|R

5|$|Thermal {{modeling}} of Saturn's moon Dione, {{which is similar}} to Ariel in size, density, and surface temperature, suggests that solid state convection could have lasted in Ariel's interior for billions of years, and that temperatures in excess of 173 K (the melting point of aqueous ammonia) may have persisted near its surface for several hundred million years after formation, and near <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> closer to the core.|$|E
5|$|Within <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> of a galaxy's formation, key {{structures}} {{begin to}} appear. Globular clusters, the central supermassive black hole, and a galactic bulge of metal-poor Population II stars form. The {{creation of a}} supermassive black hole appears to {{play a key role}} in actively regulating the growth of galaxies by limiting the total amount of additional matter added. During this early epoch, galaxies undergo a major burst of star formation.|$|E
5|$|A planet {{could also}} be perturbed from a distant {{circular}} orbit into an eccentric orbit by an encounter with another star. The in situ formation of a planet at this distance would require a very massive and extensive disk, or the outward drift of solids in a dissipating disk forming a narrow ring from which the planet accreted over <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>years.</b> If a planet formed at such a great distance while the Sun was in its birth cluster, the probability of it remaining bound to the Sun in a highly eccentric orbit is roughly 10%. A previous paper found that a massive disk extending beyond 80 AU would drive Kozai oscillations of objects scattered outward by Jupiter and Saturn, leaving {{some of them in}} high inclination (inc > 50°), low eccentricity orbits which have not been observed.|$|E
50|$|Hence, {{the lower}} Mekong basin yields about 4.5 million tonnes {{of fish and}} aquatic {{products}} annually. The total economic value of the fishery is between US$3.9 and US$7 <b>billion</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> Wild capture fisheries alone have been valued at US$2 <b>billion</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> This value increases considerably when the multiplier effect is included, but estimates vary widely.|$|R

5|$|M64 (NGC 4826) {{is known}} as the Black Eye Galaxy because of the {{prominent}} dark dust lane in front of the galaxy's bright nucleus. Also known as the Sleeping Beauty and Evil Eye galaxy, it is about 24 million light-years away. Recent studies indicate that the interstellar gas in the galaxy's outer regions rotates in the opposite direction from that in the inner regions, leading astronomers to believe that at least one satellite galaxy collided with it less than <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> ago. All other evidence of the smaller galaxy has been assimilated. At the interface between the clockwise- and counterclockwise-rotating regions are many new nebulae and young stars.|$|E
5|$|Spanning {{a period}} of over <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>years,</b> the game's story {{involves}} Gaia, daughter {{of the sun and}} mystical embodiment of the Earth, guiding the player through five distinct geological periods of the planet's history. Beginning the game as a fish, the player must travel across the planet defeating enemies and gaining the strength to evolve into more powerful and complex organisms before eventually earning a chance to enter the paradise realm of Eden, becoming Gaia's immortal partner. Crystals with the ability to influence evolution are laden throughout the player's quest, with the mystery of their origin becoming a secondary factor to the main story.|$|E
5|$|The star is {{estimated}} to be less than <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> old. Because of its relative youth, Epsilon Eridani has a higher level of magnetic activity than the present-day Sun, with a stellar wind 30 times as strong. Its rotation period is 11.2days at the equator. Epsilon Eridani is smaller and less massive than the Sun, and has a comparatively lower level of elements heavier than helium. It is a main-sequence star of spectral class K2, which means that energy generated at the core through nuclear fusion of hydrogen is emitted from the surface at a temperature of about , giving it an orange hue.|$|E
