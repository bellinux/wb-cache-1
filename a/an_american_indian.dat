5|$|After his {{athletic}} career, Thorpe struggled {{to provide for}} his family. He {{found it difficult to}} work a non-sports-related job and never held a job {{for an extended period of}} time. During the Great Depression in particular, he had various jobs, among others as an extra for several movies, usually playing <b>an</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> chief in Westerns. He also worked as a construction worker, a doorman (bouncer), a security guard and a ditch digger, and briefly joined the United States Merchant Marine in 1945.

5|$|Thorpe, {{whose parents}} were both half Caucasian, was raised as <b>an</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian.</b> His accomplishments {{occurred}} {{during a period of}} severe racial inequality in the United States. It has often been suggested that his medals were stripped because of his ethnicity.* Elfers. pg. 18 While it is difficult to prove this, the public comment at the time largely reflected this view. At the time Thorpe won his gold medals, not all Native Americans were recognized as U.S.citizens. (The U.S.government had wanted them to make concessions to adopt European-American ways to receive such recognition.) Citizenship was not granted to all American Indians until 1924.|$|E
