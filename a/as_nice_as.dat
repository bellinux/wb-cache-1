25|$|There are notable {{differences}} between the various LM-1 revisions. The Rev. 1 LM-1 is recognizable by its engraved buttons and lack of Shuffle and Auto-Correct LEDs. The drum buttons were engraved with a small symbol of the drum it represented (the bass drum button had a small engraving of a bass drum on it). These buttons were later discontinued {{because they were too}} expensive to manufacture. Internally it was different as well. It had single chips for the kick, tom, and conga sounds, and double chips for the clap. The Rev. 1 LM-1's did not have the filter on the kick, toms, and congas that Rev. 2 and later machines had. As a result, it didn't sound <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> the Rev. 2 and later machines, but the toms and congas could be played simultaneously.|$|E

500|$|The third album, titled Nice in the UK and Everything <b>As</b> <b>Nice</b> <b>As</b> Mother Makes It in the US, {{featured}} {{one side}} recorded live on their American tour and {{one side of}} studio material. As with previous albums, it included arrangements of classical material, {{in this case the}} Third Movement of Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony (Pathetique), and rearrangements of Bob Dylan's [...] "She Belongs to Me" [...] and Tim Hardin's [...] "Hang on to a Dream".|$|E
6000|$|... "No he's not, Mademoiselle; he's <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> a pair <b>as</b> you'd wish to see; that is, begging your pardon, <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> a pair <b>as</b> I'd wish to see; and he's not {{a jealous}} man either about other things." ...|$|R
60|$|THE WIFE [terrified] Us! But we {{have done}} nothing: we have been <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> to them <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> could be. Oh, Amby, come away, come away: there is {{something}} dreadful about this place and these people.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, precisely--so that I {{shall have}} these {{few moments to}} ask you for {{directions:}} you must know him by this time so well. I only want, heaven help me, to be <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> to him <b>as</b> I possibly can." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{soundtrack of}} the game was less well received. Critics panned the music as [...] "easily the worst Castlevania soundtrack" [...] and [...] "muddy, plodding, and {{reminiscent}} of the days of four-channel NES soundtracks". Conversely, GameSpot found that the music was [...] "decent" [...] and occasionally [...] "fitting or even catchy", but {{failed to live up}} to the high expectations of the series. IGN felt that while not [...] "quite as bad as importers have made it out to be", the songs [...] "aren't nearly <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> they have been in past Castlevania adventures." [...] Reviewers also disliked the lack of difficulty with GamePro describing it as the game's [...] "biggest flaw". Other criticism included predictable and easy boss battles, and [...] "a much smaller explorable area and somewhat less compelling map design".|$|E
500|$|As a stop-gap measure, the {{fortified}} vaults in {{the basement}} of the United States Treasury Building were converted into living quarters for the president and his family, to be used in the event an attack came prior to the bunker's completion. Unlike the White House, which was a fragile structure with what was then a shallow basement, the Treasury Building has a deep basement built into a foundation of granite and its vaults are nested into stone. The ten-room presidential suite sat two floors below the cash room behind a steel bank door and was described as [...] "every bit <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> a suite at the Mayflower Hotel". The tunnel, connecting the White House to the open areaway of the Treasury Building, was excavated to allow the evacuation of the president from one building to the other without the need to make the crossing outdoors.|$|E
60|$|Didn't {{you have}} a dreadful fear that I shouldn't be <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> you imagined? Now, come--honestly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll dig it up {{good and}} plenty if you don't leave these boys alone! I don't {{know much about}} 'em, {{but they seem to}} be {{perfectly}} straightforward, and their father is <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> a man <b>as</b> I ever met." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I daresay it will," [...] said Anne gravely. [...] "You ARE a {{handsome}} boy, Davy," [...] . Marilla looked volumes of disapproval [...] "but you must {{live up to}} it and be just <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> and gentlemanly <b>as</b> you look to be." ...|$|R
6000|$|I am stupid at letter-writing again; I don't know why. I hope {{it may not}} be permanent; in the meantime, {{you must}} take what you can get and be hopeful. The Russian ladies are <b>as</b> kind and <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> ever.--Ever your affectionate son, ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{tried hard}} to be gallant. [...] "Yes, she is interesting, but of course she ain't anywheres near <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> you are, Nelly, be--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that's the fellow," [...] {{said the}} man, when shown Tom's photograph. [...] "But he didn't look quite <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> that. He looked--well, wild like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She won't be <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> Mary Louise, though," [...] was the reply. [...] "There's no girl in {{the world}} as sweet and lovely as Mary Louise!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I gave two {{thousand}} dollars for her. I bought her in New Orleans and brought her up the river myself. The folks around here don't know much about gasoline launches, but I think she's <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> a craft <b>as</b> anybody would wish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay, {{that she}} would,' rejoined the other; 'she had a merry heart. 'A many, many, {{beautiful}} corpses she laid out, <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> and neat <b>as</b> waxwork. My old eyes have seen them--ay, and those old hands touched them too; for I have helped her, scores of times.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'To Alda! I looked {{twice to}} be sure that there was no {{confusion}} between the names, but it is my sister Alda beyond a doubt. He would not ask my consent if it were Marilda. Here's the letter, <b>as</b> good and <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> possible, dear good fellow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But he isn't <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> some boys," [...] went on Grace {{in a lower}} tone, {{and giving}} Sam an arch smile that made him feel very happy.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{must have}} had a chance to get off when the men started for us; but I'll bet he don't look <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> he did this morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know," [...] said Bessie, {{giving the}} blue-silk doll a fond kiss, [...] "and she's just lovely. But she ain't <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> you, Tommy, for all." ...|$|E
60|$|At the Hawkins’ {{farmhouse}} he {{had several}} things which {{he wished to}} get. Not clothing—he was too poor to own more than what was on his back—but mementos of former days, when he had had <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> a home <b>as</b> any lad in the Hopsville district.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} him {{twenty years ago}} and more; <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> a boy <b>as</b> you would wish to see. His father was the fourth of the brothers. Dear, dear! Three of them are gone; {{and the only one}} remaining is old Barty, whom no one ever loved." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Eh? O, well, I {{suppose he}} does,’ said Rosa, pouting again; ‘I am sure I {{have no right}} to say he doesn’t. Perhaps it’s my fault. Perhaps I am not <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> to him <b>as</b> I ought to be. I don’t think I am. But it is so ridiculous!’ ...|$|R
6000|$|Jacinta rose. [...] "You are <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> I {{expected}} {{you would}} be," [...] she said. [...] "Now {{it is getting}} chilly, and I have a letter to write." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I won't 'old {{you back}} no more, Piggy. Go away an' get your medal, an' I'll {{make you a}} new button-bag <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> I know how,' she whispered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you see," [...] said Makely, [...] "a fellow don't {{like to ask}} a girl {{to share}} a home that isn't <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> the home she has left." ...|$|E
6000|$|Maisie was now {{busy with}} her breakfast, and her {{companion}} attacked his own; {{so that it}} was all, in form at least, even more than their old sociability. [...] "Everything she could think of. She was <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> to her <b>as</b> you are," [...] the child said. [...] "She talked to her all day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] said he, [...] "that this is {{a strange}} girl of mine?" [...] She {{positively}} refuses to come and live with us. We had counted upon having her, and had made all our arrangements for it. She is <b>as</b> good and <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> she can be, {{but we can not}} move her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are miners. My {{husband has}} a mine {{up in the}} Basin, but he's putting in some new {{machinery}} just now and is unable to come down but once a week." [...] Then mildly resenting his implied criticism of the town, she added: [...] "We have just <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> people here <b>as</b> you'll find anywhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't 'old {{you back}} no more, Piggy. Go away an' get your medal, an' I'll {{make you a}} new button-bag <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> I know how," [...] she whispered.|$|E
60|$|Was Grizel not <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> {{she used}} to be? How can I answer, who love her the more only? There is one at least, Grizel, who will never desert you.|$|E
6000|$|... "What fun I'll {{have over}} there," [...] thought Jill, {{watching}} the merry scene with intense interest, {{and wondering if}} the little girls she saw were <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> Molly and Merry.|$|E
50|$|In addition, UTA {{had limited}} rights to carry passengers, {{cargo and mail}} on the {{internal}} legs of its long-haul services, between Paris Charles de Gaulle and Lyon, Marseille, <b>Nice</b> <b>as</b> well as Bordeaux. However, flights were too infrequent to {{pose a threat to}} Air Inter.|$|R
50|$|The {{department}} was reconstituted in 1860 when {{the county of}} Nice was annexed by France. It included the county of <b>Nice</b> <b>as</b> well as the previously (at least nominally) independent towns of Menton and Roquebrune, and the arrondissement of Grasse {{in the department of}} Var.|$|R
50|$|The next day's photo-shoot is for {{the very}} high fashion Catalogue magazine, with each girl having to pose seductively with a male model while dressed in regal attire. Sophie sets the bar high with an {{impressive}} performance on set, while Jade also shines, delivering some sexy poses, which leaves Sophie questioning whether Jade is <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> and innocent <b>as</b> she seems.|$|R
