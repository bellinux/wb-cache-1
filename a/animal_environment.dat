50|$|The Upper Harz National Park was {{established}} {{as part of}} GDR's national park programme on 1 October 1990, {{two days before the}} reunification of Germany, {{on the basis of a}} ministerial decision by the East German government. The park included large parts of the eastern Harz, roughly from the Ecker Dam and the national park municipality of Ilsenburg in the north and Schierke in the south as well as the Brocken. The region is characterised by a relatively undisturbed plant and <b>animal</b> <b>environment,</b> which is mainly due to its location immediately next to the old Inner German Border. In the German Democratic Republic era, the Brocken was accessible until 1961 with an easily obtained pass. From 13 August 1961 it became an out-of-bounds area, which meant that tourists could no longer visit it. In the mid-1980s the first problems appeared in the Harz, such as bark beetle and fungal infestation. In the wake of the spirit of optimism during the time around reunification it was exactly this that gave impetus for the establishment of the national park. On 1 January 1991 a national park headquarters in Wernigerode was set up under the leadership of Hubertus Hlawatsch. Hlawatsch's successor was Peter Gaffert, who ran the eastern park from 1995 until its merger with the Harz National Park in the western Harz on 1 January 2006.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to reveal out the prevalence of Sarcoptic mite infestation and the risk factors associated with occurrence of mange in one-humped camels (Camulus dromedarius) at smallholder farms in Upper Egypt, and to develop an applicable therapeutical protocol for the Sarcoptic mange infested camels. A total of 660 one-humped camels were randomly selected from different villages of Assiut, Upper Egypt. The animals were undergone clinical and parasitological examinations. Skin scrapings revealed that Sarcoptes scabiei var. cameli mite was present in 6. 06 % (n= 40 / 660) camels of the area. Statistical analysis of some ecological parameters showed that there was significant relationship (P< 0. 05) between mite infestation in camels and season, housing management, and use of acaricides. On the other hand, age and sex did not significantly affect the prevalence of the disease. Topical application of moxidectin at 0. 5 mg/kg bwt or subcutaneous administration of doramectin at 200 μg/kg bwt, along with treatment of <b>animal</b> <b>environment</b> was found to be the best protocol for the eradication and prevention of Sarcoptic mange in camel.

40|$|Six {{selected}} pig farms of a fattening {{association in}} Lower Saxony, Germany, were surveyed for Salmonella and Campylobacter. It was {{the aim of}} the study to find out possible relationships between positive results and predilection sites or farm management. The procedure: Samples were taken from the <b>animal</b> <b>environment.</b> Following the black and white separation scheme of the farms, samples were allocated to the interior (faeces, slatted floors, feeding and drinking troughs, flies, boots), to the exterior (water from the site, soil, bird faeces, rectal swabs from dogs or cats) and from the supply and disposing area (feed silos, municipal or fountain water, compost). In addition, farm internal management factors were taken as well as a ground view of the aerea was set up. All farms were visited twice during the year 2003 (between January and June and between September and November). In total, 657 samples were tested for Salmonella (following DIN ISO 6579) and Campylobacter (following ISO DIS 10272). The obtained Salmonella strains were serotyped at the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, the species differentiation of the Campylobacter isolates was performed via biochemical reactions in the laboratory of the institute. Results: Isolates: Results reflect a different burden and distribution of the zoonotic agents in the environment. Salmonella was detected in 5, 9 % of all samples. Three of six farms were positive, the percentage ranged from 0, 0 % to 28, 1 %. Based on all results, isolates were obtained from 6 % of samples from the interior, from 7, 8 % of samples from the exterior and in 2, 7 % of cases from the supply and disposal area. Predominantly identified were Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Derby. Campylobacter was obtained from 27, 4 % of all samples, with a detection rate between 12, 5 % and 41, 2 %. Campylobacter isolates were only found in the interior (35, 0 %) and in the exterior (11, 6 %). Predominantly identified species were Campylobacter lari and Campylobacter coli. Management: Circumstances which might promote the occurrence of Salmonella and Campylobacter were identified. Salmonella positive were the animal environments in farms with more than 12 animals per pen (farm D and F) as well as farms with a stocking number of more than 1000 and more animals (farm C and D). However, the effect of stocking number was not always the case: (farm E and F). It was concluded that the presence of more than one species present on the site (farm C) or not appropriate hygiene and farm management (defect drinking trough facilities, spilling liquid manure [farm D]) might further promote the occurrence of Salmonella in the <b>animal</b> <b>environment.</b> A higher burden of Campylobacter was obtained in the environment of farms without disinfection in contrast to farms performing disinfection (farm A and C), with the exemption of farm F (no disinfection), showing the second lowest Campylobacter detection rate.

30|$|An {{increasing}} {{trend in}} aquaculture {{is to reduce}} the reliance on antibiotics since these can be an effective prophylactic against disease as well as growth promoter when used at low doses, the long-term consequences can be harmful to the host <b>animal,</b> <b>environment</b> and potentially the human consumer (reviewed by Defoirdt et al. 2009; Marshall and Levy 2011). A promising alternative to antibiotics are organic acids, which include short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), which are “generally regarded as safe” compounds with one or more carboxyl groups and less than six carbons in their molecular formula. These have been used for many decades in the terrestrial animal feed industry as an antimicrobial and growth promoter (Thompson and Hinton 1997; Kluge et al. 2006). In more recent years, organic acids such as lactic, formic, citric and propionic acids and their associated salts have been the focus of research for use in aquatic animal feeds (Ng and Koh 2011, 2016; Sukor et al. 2016).|$|E
