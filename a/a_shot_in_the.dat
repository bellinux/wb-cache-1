5|$|Colbert {{attended}} Charleston's Episcopal Porter-Gaud School, {{where he}} participated in several school plays {{and contributed to the}} school newspaper but was not highly motivated academically. During his adolescence, he briefly fronted <b>A</b> <b>Shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dark, a Rolling Stones cover band. When he was younger, he had hoped to study marine biology, but surgery intended to repair a severely perforated eardrum caused him inner ear damage. The damage was severe enough that he was unable to pursue a career that would involve scuba diving. The damage also left him deaf in his right ear.|$|E
5|$|Sauerbrunn {{was named}} to the roster for the 2016 SheBelieves Cup that took place from March 3 to 9. She started in the team's opening match of the tournament on March 3 against England. Sauerbrunn was noted for her good {{positioning}} during the match, helping block <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 59th minute. She also made appearances in other two matches of the tournament, helping the United States win the 2016 SheBelieves Cup with a 2–1 win over Germany in their final game.|$|E
5|$|After playing 48 {{games in}} the 2006–07 NHL season, Kesler {{suffered}} a torn acetabular labrum and missed {{the remainder of the}} regular season, finishing the season with sixteen points. Kesler returned to the Canucks lineup for the first game of their quarterfinal playoff series versus the Dallas Stars. While blocking <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth overtime of the game, Kesler was re-injured, suffering a displaced index finger. Despite finishing the game, Kesler was forced to undergo surgery to repair the damage and missed the remainder of the playoffs. In the off-season, the Canucks re-signed Kesler to a three-year, $5.25-million contract extension on May 24, 2007. In comparison to his previous contract, facilitated by the Flyers' offer sheet, the deal represented a $150,000 paycut in terms of average annual salary.|$|E

5|$|Asylum {{digitally}} created {{weapons for}} various scenes. In {{the scene in}} which Nolan is killed suddenly by <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> head from Jason's arrow, Asylum created the arrow in post-production. Another scene involved Jason hurling a hatchet at Lawrence as he runs away, striking him in the back. The shot of a hatchet flying through the airin one instance appearing in the same frame as the actorwould be too difficult to achieve practically. Asylum rendered a complete 3D model of the hatchet then inserted the model into the frames {{leading up to the}} frame in which it hits the character in the back. One of the final images added by Asylum was for Trent's death scene. Here, Asylum digitally created a metal spike that bursts through Trent's chest as Jason slams him onto the back of a tow truck.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{signed for}} Ebbsfleet's Conference Premier rivals York City on a free {{transfer}} on 29 June 2009. He made his debut in a 2–1 defeat to Oxford on 8 August 2009, before scoring his first {{goal for the}} club with the opener in a 1–1 draw with Luton Town on 20 October with <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bottom corner. He scored the opening goal in a 3–1 defeat to Premier League team Stoke City in the FA Cup third round on 2 January 2010, with a header from an Alex Lawless free kick. He picked up a hamstring injury during March 2010, missing one match before making his return in a 1–0 victory over Mansfield Town later that month. He played in both legs of York's play-off semi-final victory over Luton, which finished 2–0 on aggregate. He signed a new one-year contract with York on 13 May 2010. He started in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 16 May, being substituted on 81 minutes, with York losing 3–1 to Oxford. He finished 2009–10 with 51 appearances and five goals for York.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} staircase set in Washington, D.C. {{was filmed}} in San Francisco's City Hall. The University of the Pacific's campus in Stockton, California, stood {{in for the}} exterior of the college where Jones works, while his classroom and the hall where he meets the American intelligence agents was filmed at the Royal Masonic School for Girls in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, England, which was again used in The Last Crusade. His home exteriors were filmed in San Rafael, California. Opening sequence exteriors were filmed in Kauai, Hawaii, with Spielberg wrapping in September in 73days, finishing under schedule in contrast to his previous film, 1941. The Washington, D.C. coda, although it appeared in the script's early drafts, was not included in early edits but was added later when it was realized that there was no resolution to Jones' relationship with Marion. Shots of the Douglas DC-3 Jones flies on to Nepal were taken from Lost Horizon, and a street scene was from <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Hindenburg. Filming of Jones boarding a Boeing Clipper flying-boat was complicated by the lack of a surviving aircraft. Eventually, a post-war British Short Solent flying-boat formerly owned by Howard Hughes was located in California and substituted.|$|E

25|$|As {{the series}} shifted back to Sacramento for Game 5, the Kings trailed {{almost the entire}} fourth quarter, but a jump shot by Bibby off a screen with 8.2 seconds left gave them the lead and was the game-winner in a 92-91 win. Bibby scored 23 in all, and Webber had 29 points and 13 rebounds in support. Bryant led L.A. with 30 points, but missed a {{potential}} game winner at the buzzer.

Again severely wounded, by <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stomach from close range, Tolsdorff managed to return to active duty within a few weeks.

Paterson, now with a rifle, ran back outside and onto Champ Street. He decided he could not get a clear shot, so he stood on a low wall in the prison's front garden. He aimed his rifle at Ryan, and claimed he fired <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air when a woman came into his line of sight.|$|E

Searching for Standard Gravure's President, Michael Shea, and other supervisors and managers of the plant, Wesbecker calmly walked through the hallways, deliberately shooting at people. He killed James Husband and injured Forrest Conrad, Paula Warman and John Stein, a bindery supervisor whom he shot in the head and abdomen.

25|$|Porter's 21 mortar schooners were {{in place}} on April 18. They were placed close to the river banks {{downstream}} from the barrier chain, which was still in place. Their tops were covered with bushes for camouflage; this was replaced {{as soon as it}} was stripped away by the shock of firing their weapons. Commencing in the early morning, the mortars kept up a steady fire all day. Porter had specified a rate of a shot every ten minutes from each mortar, which would have kept <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air throughout the bombardment. The rate could not be maintained, but more than 1400 shots were fired on the first day. The rate of fire was somewhat less on subsequent days.|$|E
25|$|British Army corporals David Howes and Derek Wood {{were killed}} by the Provisional IRA on 19 March 1988 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in an event which became known as the corporals killings. The off-duty {{soldiers}} were wearing plain-clothes when they {{were killed by}} the IRA after encountering the funeral procession of an IRA member whilst returning from Belfast to Lisburn. Three days before, loyalist paramilitary Michael Stone had attacked an IRA funeral and killed three people. Believing the soldiers were loyalists intent on repeating Stone's attack, dozens of people surrounded and attacked their car. During this, Corporal Wood drew his service pistol and fired <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. The soldiers were then dragged from the car, beaten, and taken to nearby waste ground where they were stripped and shot dead.|$|E
