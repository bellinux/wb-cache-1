40|$|Grapevine-associated {{microbiota}} influences wine organoleptic properties. Spoilage due to undesired microorganisms and biogenic amines (BAs) presence are {{two main}} constrains that must be seriously considered. In wine, BAs can originate from the grape berries or can be produced during fermentation, ageing or storage. This work aimed to understand if the high BAs levels observed in musts can have its origin in the microbial community present on grapes. The following methodologies were done: bacterial and fungal grapes communities' isolation, BAs quantification in grapes <b>and</b> <b>musts</b> <b>and</b> molecular amplification of the genes related to BAs production. For comparative purposes, microbial communities from grapes <b>and</b> <b>musts</b> from Douro (low BAs levels in <b>musts)</b> <b>and</b> Alentejo (high BAs levels in musts) were used. Higher number and diversity of bacteria were observed in Alentejo grapes comparatively to Douro ones. Filamentous fungi were predominant when compared with yeasts and the diversity was higher in Alentejo. BAs levels mainly due to putrescin were about ten times higher in grapes <b>and</b> <b>musts</b> from Alentejo. As bacteria isolated from Alentejo grapes showed a great BAs-production potential, namely putrescin, our results suggest a bacterial grape origin for the high putrescine levels found in fresh musts of this region...|$|R

The player is then sent to Bug Court, where they sign their work visa. The player then travels under the water below Bug Mars, while listening to a narrated history {{of the creation of}} boxing.
