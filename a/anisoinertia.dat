40|$|A Kearfott {{pendulous}} accelerometer was integrated with a United Aircraft pulse torque servo assembly (PTSA) forced binary loop. The test {{objective was to}} measure dynamic errors due to <b>anisoinertia</b> and OA coupling effects. The instrument and its torque loop are described, and the technique for isolating the <b>anisoinertia</b> error from centripetal acceleration effects is discussed in detail. The measured <b>anisoinertia</b> error coefficient was 3. 0 cm, and the testing confirmed that no rectified OA coupling error was present...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the primary strapdown inertial system computational elements and their interrelationship. Using an aircraft type strapdown inertial navigation system as a representative example, the paper provides differential equations for attitude, velocity, position determination, associated integral solution functions, and representative algorithms for system computer implementation. For the inertial sensor errors, angular rate sensor and accelerometer analytical models are presented including associated compensation algorithms for correction in the system computer. Sensor compensation techniques are discussed for coning, sculling, scrolling computation algorithms and for accelerometer output adjustment for physical size effect separation and <b>anisoinertia</b> error. Navigation error parameters are described and related to errors in the system computed attitude, velocity, position solutions. Differential equations for the navigation error parameters are presented showing error parameter propagation in response to residual inertial sensor errors (following sensor compensation) and to errors in the gravity model used in the system computer.
