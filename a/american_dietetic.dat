25|$|In Australia {{malnutrition}} or risk {{of malnutrition}} occurs in 80 percent {{of elderly people}} presented to hospitals for admission. Malnutrition and weight loss can contribute to sarcopenia with loss of lean body mass and muscle function. Abdominal obesity or weight loss coupled with sarcopenia lead to immobility, skeletal disorders, insulin resistance, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and metabolic disorders. A paper from the Journal of the <b>American</b> <b>Dietetic</b> Association noted that routine nutrition screenings represent one way to detect and therefore decrease the prevalence of malnutrition in the elderly.|$|E
25|$|The <b>American</b> <b>Dietetic</b> Association said in 2009 that {{a variety}} of plant foods {{consumed}} {{over the course of a}} day can provide all the essential amino acids for healthy adults, which means that protein combining in the same meal may not be necessary. Mangels et al. write that there is little reason to advise vegans to increase their protein intake, but erring on the side of caution, they recommend a 25 percent increase over the RDA for adults, to 1.0gram of protein per kilogram of body weight.|$|E

Some key risk factors for obesity in truckers are poor eating habits, lack of access to healthy food, lack of exercise, sedentary lifestyle, long work hours, and lack of access to care.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>American</b> <b>Dietetic</b> Association has {{presented}} evidence that vegetarian diets {{may be more}} common among adolescents with eating disorders. At {{the same time the}} association cautions however, that the adoption of a vegetarian diet may not necessarily lead to eating disorders, rather that [...] "vegetarian diets may be selected to camouflage an existing eating disorder". Other studies and statements by dietitians and counselors support this conclusion.|$|E
2500|$|Blanket {{recommendations}} to lower saturated fat were criticized at a 2010 conference debate of the <b>American</b> <b>Dietetic</b> Association for focusing too narrowly on reducing saturated fats rather than emphasizing increased consumption of healthy fats and unrefined carbohydrates. [...] Concern was expressed over {{the health risks}} of replacing saturated fats in the diet with refined carbohydrates, which carry {{a high risk of}} obesity and heart disease, particularly at the expense of polyunsaturated fats which may have health benefits. [...] None of the panelists recommended heavy consumption of saturated fats, emphasizing instead the importance of overall dietary quality to cardiovascular health.|$|E
2500|$|In some countries, {{recombinant}} (GM) {{bovine somatotropin}} (also called rBST, or {{bovine growth hormone}} or BGH) is approved for administration to increase milk production. rBST may be present in milk from rBST treated cows, but it is destroyed in the digestive system and even if directly injected into the human bloodstream, has no observable effect on humans. The FDA, World Health Organization, American Medical Association, <b>American</b> <b>Dietetic</b> Association and the National Institutes of Health have independently stated that dairy products and meat from rBST-treated cows are safe for human consumption. However, on 30 September 2010, the United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, analyzing submitted evidence, found a [...] "compositional difference" [...] between milk from rBGH-treated cows and milk from untreated cows. The court stated that milk from rBGH-treated cows has: increased levels of the hormone Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1); higher fat content and lower protein content when produced at certain points in the cow's lactation cycle; and more somatic cell counts, which may [...] "make the milk turn sour more quickly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Efamol {{continued}} to ship EPO into the United States and to market its products. In a 1989 article on [...] "health food frauds", the New York Times {{reported on the}} FDA's seizure of [...] "more than $1 million worth" [...] of illegal EPO. The FDA again accused Efamol of marketing the oil [...] "with unsubstantiated claims of treating {{a wide variety of}} illnesses". [...] Efamol's lawyers responded that the product was not dangerous and that it had not made unsubstantiated claims. The <b>American</b> <b>Dietetic</b> Association, representing over 50,000 nutritionists, questioned the value of Horrobin's product since [...] "one-tenth of a teaspoon of ordinary corn oil has as much of the fatty acids as a capsule of Evening Primrose Oil, {{at a fraction of the}} cost". In 1989, the FDA commissioned a report by investigator Stephen Barrett, a medical doctor and consumer protection advocate. Barrett advised the FDA that Horrobin's marketing of Efamol was done in [...] "a transparent attempt to evade the food and drug laws". In a report on the incident published by the consumer information organisation Quackwatch, Barrett also questions Horrobin's research ethics: [...] "Would someone that contemptuous of the law have any qualms about faking data?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Vegetarian diets {{typically}} contain similar {{levels of}} iron to non-vegetarian diets, {{but this has}} lower bioavailability than iron from meat sources, and its absorption can sometimes be inhibited by other dietary constituents. According to the Vegetarian Resource Group, consuming food that contains vitamin C, such as citrus fruit or juices, tomatoes, or broccoli, {{is a good way}} to increase the amount of iron absorbed at a meal. Vegetarian foods rich in iron include black beans, cashews, hempseed, kidney beans, broccoli, lentils, oatmeal, raisins, [...] spinach, cabbage, lettuce, black-eyed peas, soybeans, many breakfast cereals, sunflower seeds, chickpeas, tomato juice, tempeh, molasses, thyme, and whole-wheat bread. The related vegan diets can often be higher in iron than vegetarian diets, because dairy products are low in iron. Iron stores often tend to be lower in vegetarians than non-vegetarians, and a few small studies report very high rates of iron deficiency (up to 40%, and 58% of the respective vegetarian or vegan groups). However, the <b>American</b> <b>Dietetic</b> Association states that iron deficiency is no more common in vegetarians than non-vegetarians (adult males are rarely iron deficient); iron deficiency anaemia is rare no matter the diet.|$|E
