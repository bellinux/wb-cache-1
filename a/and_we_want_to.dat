To do this, we could allocate the first school numbers 1to150, the second school 151 to 330(=150+180), the third school 331 to 530, and so on to the last school (1011 to1500). We then generate a random start between 1 and 500 (equal to1500/3) and count through the school populations by multiples of 500. If our random start was 137, we would select the schools which have been allocated numbers 137, 637, and1137, i.e. the first, fourth, and sixth schools.|$|E

500|$|Along with coaching, Harry Sinden {{was given}} the task of {{selecting}} Team Canada, {{which would be the}} first true [...] "team" [...] composed of NHL all-stars. When Sinden announced the list of 35 Canadian players on July 12, one of the conditions of playing was revealed; that players would have to have a signed NHL contract by August 13. His list of players included Bobby Hull, who by that time had already signed with the rival World Hockey Association (WHA) league. Three other players Sinden named: Gerry Cheevers, Derek Sanderson and J. C. Tremblay had not yet signed with the WHA, but would do so and become ineligible. The condition had been negotiated between the NHL and Hockey Canada, and the NHL would not relent. The condition was widely criticized, including by the NHL's own Harold Ballard, the Toronto Maple Leafs owner and a harsh opponent of the WHA. Ballard felt that the series was the [...] "unofficial world series of hockey <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> win". Phil Reimer, a governor of Hockey Canada, resigned over the matter. Prime Minister Trudeau made a personal appeal, but Doug Fisher, chairman of Hockey Canada refused to re-open the agreement between the NHL and Hockey Canada.|$|E
500|$|Several {{scenes in}} Inside Man {{required}} multiple-camera setups, {{which meant that}} Libatique had to instruct and work with multiple camera operators. Lee {{wanted to create a}} visual distinction between the characters Russell (Owen) and Frazier (Washington), while incorporating visual metaphors. Russell's scenes, in which he masterminds the bank heist, were shot with a Steadicam to suggest that the character is in control. Frazier's scenes, in which he is tasked with handling the hostage situation, were filmed with multiple hand-held cameras to display the character's confusion. Libatique explained, [...] "I said, 'We want {{to create a sense of}} control and largely centered frames with Clive’s character, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> have movement with Denzel’s.' Having three operators on the same character, I’d watch all three. In a handheld shot, a long lens has a little bit of movement and a wider lens is inherently smoother. I would actually talk to the operator and tell him not to be so steady. It was the first time I’d worked with so many operators where I wasn’t one myself." [...] Telephone conversations between Russell and Frazier were shot using two cameras simultaneously filming the actors performing on two different sets of a soundstage at Steiner Studios. [...] Steadicam operator Stephen Consentino estimated that 80% of the film was shot with hand-held cameras or a Steadicam. A total of seven cameras were used to film the scene where the hostages are finally released. A Technocrane was used for a crane shot that would cover the following moment, in which the hostages are placed in buses.|$|E

500|$|Kristen Bell was lauded for her {{performance}} as Anna in the film. Michelle Im, {{writing for the}} Eye of the Tiger referred to the character as [...] "bubbly and spirited", and commented, [...] "Not only was [...] able to nail those vibratos and belting notes in her songs, it was actually her singing them." [...] The Coast News review of the film wrote that Bell [...] "earns top marks" [...] for instilling a spirited sensibility in the clumsy but well-meaning Anna. Cinenerd, a film critic for Blogcritics, commended the actress' singing ability, stating that she and Menzel [...] "sing their hearts out, with two showstoppers in Let it Go and For the First Time in Forever". Colin Covert of Colorado Springs' The Gazette considered Bell's performance as a [...] "flawless delivery". Matt Goldberg extolled the relationship between Anna and her elder sister Elsa, writing, [...] "There's so much to love about Frozen, but {{at the top of}} the list is the emphasis on [...] and Elsa's relationship. Anna still has an infatuation with the charming Hans and romantic chemistry with the flustered Kristoff, but her greatest love is for her sister. [...] is mostly scared and guilt-ridden. She's an incredibly sympathetic character, and it's a fresh spin on depicting estrangement between siblings. Anna has so much life and enthusiasm, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see her share it with Elsa." [...] Magdalena Lachowicz of The Heights referred to this sisterly bond as [...] "what truly makes the film and the moral that comes with it", commenting, [...] "the plot is set up to lead the viewer into thinking that it needs to be true love's kiss—something which Anna then goes to seek. This journey sends her on a difficult adventure in which she learns about both sacrifice and love." [...] Debbie Lynn Elias of Culver City Observer commented, [...] "Female driven with confidence and positivity, Elsa and Anna are like two sides of a coin, both strong, albeit one through power and confidence and the other through clumsy sticktuitiveness and love," [...] while Stephen Holden from The New York Times appreciated that instead of a romantic attachment, it was a sisterly love and devotion that drove the story, which departed greatly from traditional Disney formula. Noah Lee described Anna and Elsa's relationship as [...] "genuine", saying, [...] "watching those themes of family and love versus isolation and fear touched my heart in more ways than one." ...|$|E
