5|$|Stainless steels {{contain a}} minimum of 11% chromium, often {{combined}} with nickel, to resist corrosion. Some stainless steels, such as the ferritic stainless steels are magnetic, while others, such as the <b>austenitic,</b> are nonmagnetic. Corrosion-resistant steels are abbreviated as CRES.|$|E
5|$|Three of {{the most}} {{commonly}} used crystal lattice structures in metals are the body-centred cubic, face-centred cubic and close-packed hexagonal. Ferritic steel has a body-centred cubic structure and <b>austenitic</b> steel, non-ferrous metals like aluminum, copper and nickel have the face-centred cubic structure.|$|E
5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the mixtures are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase the speed {{and quality of the}} AC welding of aluminum, and also make it easier to strike an arc. Another shielding gas mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the austenite in <b>austenitic</b> stainless steels and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.|$|E
5|$|When steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a {{eutectoid}} steel), are cooled, the <b>austenitic</b> phase (FCC) of {{the mixture}} attempts {{to revert to}} the ferrite phase (BCC). The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite, leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with {{a small percentage of}} carbon in solution. The two, ferrite and cementite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called pearlite, named for its resemblance to mother of pearl. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon), the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the austenite grain boundaries until the percenage of carbon in the grains has decreased to the eutectoid composition (0.8% carbon), at which point the pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% carbon (hypoeutectoid), ferrite will first form within the grains until the remaining composition rises to 0.8% of carbon, at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in hypoeuctoid steel. The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.|$|E
25|$|Production of high purity <b>austenitic</b> {{stainless}} steel. High purity <b>austenitic</b> {{stainless steel}} was of interest {{as a potential}} cladding material for nuclear fuel elements. Fulmer produced high purity chromium by electro-deposition from a fluoride bath. Zone refining using induction heating was used to produce high-purity iron and nickel and to remove oxygen from chromium. Impurity levels of 1-40 parts per million were achieved.|$|E
25|$|The strength-enhancing {{effect of}} wire drawing can be substantial. The highest {{strengths}} available on any steel {{have been recorded}} on small-diameter cold-drawn <b>austenitic</b> stainless wire. Tensile strength can {{be as high as}} 400 ksi (2760 MPa).|$|E
25|$|The lower {{loops of}} hottest superheaters {{can be made}} of <b>austenitic</b> material, with better {{corrosion}} resistance. The steam velocity in the hottest superheater tubes is high, decreasing the tube surface temperature. Low tube surface temperatures are essential to prevent superheater corrosion. A high steam side pressure loss over the hot superheaters ensures uniform steam flow in tube elements.|$|E
25|$|Alastair Pilkington {{invented the}} float glass method of {{manufacture}} in 1957 at St Helens, announcing it in January 1959. It was manufacturered from 1961, and 80% of the world's glass is made with the process; the former site closed in 2014 and it is made now at the Green Gate site. Pears soap, made at Port Sunlight, is the world's first registered brand, and world's oldest brand in existence. Elihu Thomson, born in Manchester who subsequently moved to America, formed Thomson-CSF which became Thales Group in 2000. The British part (British Thomson-Houston) would later become part of GEC; he invented the arc lamp. Henry Brunner from Liverpool would join with Ludwig Mond in the 1860s to form a chemical company which became ICI in 1926. Mossbay Steelworks in Workington, when opened in 1877, were the world's first large-scale steelworks; its <b>austenitic</b> manganese steel (mangalloy) was produced from 1877 until 1974, with Britain's railways converting from iron to steel by the 1880s. Track was made there for the UK's railways (exclusively from the 1970s onwards, with the steel made in Teesside) until August 2006; much of the rails made were exported (from 1882), with its main competitor being Voestalpine of Austria, and a plant (bought by British Steel in 1999) in Hayange, France, who make all of SNCF's railway tracks, and the Katowice Steelworks in Poland. Workington was thought {{to make the best}} quality rail track in the world.|$|E
500|$|For GTAW {{of carbon}} and {{stainless}} steels, {{the selection of}} a filler material is important to prevent excessive porosity. Oxides on the filler material and workpieces must be removed before welding to prevent contamination, and immediately prior to welding, alcohol or acetone should be used to clean the surface. Preheating is generally not necessary for mild steels less than one inch thick, but low alloy steels may require preheating to slow the cooling process and prevent the formation of martensite in the heat-affected zone. [...] Tool steels should also be preheated to prevent cracking in the heat-affected zone. <b>Austenitic</b> stainless steels do not require preheating, but martensitic and ferritic chromium stainless steels do. A DCEN power source is normally used, and thoriated electrodes, tapered to a sharp point, are recommended. Pure argon is used for thin workpieces, but helium can be introduced as thickness increases.|$|E
500|$|The Chrysler Building uses silvery [...] "Enduro KA-2" [...] metal {{extensively}} in its design. The metal is an <b>austenitic</b> stainless steel developed in Germany by Krupp and marketed under the trade name [...] "Nirosta" [...] (a German acronym for nichtrostender Stahl, meaning [...] "non-rusting steel"). The Nirosta steel, whose first use in an American project {{was in the}} Chrysler Building, was was {{also referred to as}} [...] "18-8 stainless steel" [...] because it was composed of 18% chromium and 8% nickel. Nirosta was used in the exterior ornaments, the window frames, the crown, and the needle. The steel {{was an integral part of}} Van Alen's design, as E.E. Thum explains: [...] "The use of permanently bright metal was of greatest aid in the carrying of rising lines and the diminishing circular forms in the roof treatment, so as to accentuate the gradual upward swing until it literally dissolves into the sky...." [...] Stainless steel producers used the Chrysler Building to experiment with the durability of stainless steel in architecture. In 1929, the American Society for Testing Materials created a stainless steel inspection committee. Its members saw the Chrysler Building as the best location to study the effect of the environment on stainless steel, so they created a smaller subcommittee to examine the building's panels every five years. The inspections were canceled after 1960 because the panels had shown minimal deterioration.|$|E
2500|$|Ferritic nitrocarburizing diffuses mostly {{nitrogen}} and some carbon {{into the case}} of a workpiece below the critical temperature, approximately [...] Under the critical temperature the workpiece's microstructure does not convert to an <b>austenitic</b> phase, but stays in the ferritic phase, which is why it is called ferritic nitrocarburization.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the narrow}} range of {{mixtures}} of hydrogen and iron that make an iron hydride at atmospheric pressure, {{a small number of}} different metallurgical structures with different properties can form. At room temperature, the most stable form of pure iron is the body-centerd cubic (BCC) structure called alpha-iron or α-iron. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a very small concentration of hydrogen, no more than 0.0002% at [...] and 0.0004 wt% at [...] The inclusion of hydrogen in alpha iron is called ferritic iron hydride. At [...] pure iron transforms into a face-centred cubic (FCC) structure, called gamma-iron or γ-iron. The inclusion of hydrogen in gamma iron is called <b>austenitic</b> iron hydride. The more open FCC structure of <b>austenitic</b> iron can dissolve somewhat more hydrogen, as much as 0.0009% hydrogen at [...] At this temperature iron transforms into another BCC structure called delta-iron or δ-iron. It can dissolve even more hydrogen, as much as 0.001% hydrogen at , which reflects the upper hydrogen content of iron hydride.|$|E
2500|$|Some <b>austenitic</b> {{stainless}} steels and nickel-based alloys {{are prone to}} intergranular corrosion. When subjected to temperatures around [...] for too long a time, chromium reacts with carbon in the material, forming chromium carbide and depleting the crystal edges of chromium, impairing their corrosion resistance in a process called sensitization. Such sensitized steel undergoes corrosion in the areas near the welds where the temperature-time was favorable for forming the carbide. This kind of corrosion is often termed weld decay.|$|E
2500|$|Ferritic nitrocarburizing, {{also known}} by the {{proprietary}} names Tennifer/ Tenifer and Melonite, [...] is a range of proprietary case hardening processes that diffuse nitrogen and carbon into ferrous metals at sub-critical temperatures during a salt bath. The processing temperature ranges from [...] to , but usually occurs at [...] At this temperature steels and other ferrous alloys are still in a ferritic phase, which is advantageous compared to other case hardening processes {{that occur in the}} <b>austenitic</b> phase. There are four main classes of ferritic nitrocarburizing: gaseous, salt bath, ion or plasma, and fluidized-bed.|$|E

Each valve is held closed by a pair of concentric coil springs. A single, seven-bearing camshaft, located centrally on the top of each cylinder head operates 24 individual steel rockers; 12 pivoting from a rocker shaft on the inner, intake side of the block to actuate the exhaust valves, the others pivoting from a shaft on the exhaust side of the block to actuate the inlet valves.|$|E

50|$|<b>Austenitic</b> {{stainless}} steel {{is a specific}} type of {{stainless steel}} alloy. Stainless steels may be classified by their crystalline structure into three main types: <b>austenitic,</b> ferritic and martensitic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Austenitic,</b> or 200 and 300 series, {{stainless}} steels have an <b>austenitic</b> crystalline structure, {{which is a}} face-centered cubic crystal structure. Austenite steels make up over 70% of total stainless steel production. They contain a maximum of 0.15% carbon, a minimum of 16% chromium, and sufficient nickel and/or manganese to retain an <b>austenitic</b> structure at all temperatures from the cryogenic region to the melting point of the alloy.|$|E
5000|$|... 300 Series <b>austenitic</b> {{stainless}} steel has austenite as its primary phase (face centered cubic crystal). These are alloys containing chromium and nickel, and sometimes molybdenum and nitrogen, structured around the Type 302 composition of iron, 18% chromium, and 8% nickel. 200 Series <b>austenitic</b> {{stainless steel}}s replace {{the majority of}} their nickel content with manganese to reduce cost. <b>Austenitic</b> steels are not hardenable by heat treatment. The most familiar stainless steel is probably SAE 304 stainless steel, also called 18/8 or A2 stainless steel.

50|$|Niti wires {{are known}} to have a unique {{property}} of shape memory. Niti wires can exist in two forms known as <b>Austenitic</b> and Martensitic. A temperature phase known as Temperature Transition Range (TTR) serves two define these earlier phase of the Niti wire. Below the TTR temperature, the crystals of Niti wires exist in the Martensitic form and above the TTR, crystals exist as the <b>Austenitic</b> form. The <b>austenitic</b> form happens at high temperatures, low stresses and martensitic phase occurs at low temperatures and high stresses. <b>Austenitic</b> form has body centered cubic (BCC) structure and Martensitic has distorted monoclinic, triclinic or Hexagonal structure. The wire is manufactured and fabricated at temperatures which exist above the TTR. As the wire is warmed above this temperature, it remembers its original shape and conforms to it. Therefore, this property of the wire is known as Shape-memory alloy.|$|E
