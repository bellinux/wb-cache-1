40|$|Highlights: • <b>Regional</b> <b>initiatives</b> have {{recently}} developed in areas beyond national jurisdiction. • They advance {{the governance of}} these areas while the global discussions are on-going. • They however face many challenges, which should be tackled. • Global discussions and regional actions are two interconnected processes. Abstract: The development of <b>regional</b> <b>initiatives</b> {{for the protection of}} the environment is a cornerstone of international environmental policies. With regard to marine and coastal issues, this regionalisation has mainly been taking place through regional seas programmes and Regional Fisheries Management Organisations. Some <b>regional</b> <b>initiatives</b> and organisations have progressively extended their activities to areas beyond national jurisdiction. This paper aims at analysing these recent developments, highlighting their interests and challenges, and proposing options to strengthen the efficiency of regional actions in these areas. It also highlights the need to consider the global discussions on a possible new global agreement and the development of regional actions as two interconnected processes...|$|R

40|$|Ph. D. [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Humanities, School of Social Sciences, International RelationsAfrican governments {{regularly}} advocate regionalism as a {{means for}} facilitating economic development, but the record of intergovernmental cooperation to implement <b>regional</b> <b>initiatives</b> has been disappointing. Most explanations for this record are based on a simplistic portrayal of the challenges of cooperation. They imply that if governments prefer cooperative outcomes, they will cooperate; conversely, if governments are seen not cooperate, they must not have preferred cooperative outcomes. This thesis uses an alternative framework – derived from game-theoretic perspectives on the logic of collective action – to show that <b>regional</b> <b>initiatives</b> do not succeed or fail simply because of {{the presence or absence of}} gains from cooperation. The strategic self-interests of governments are often at odds with the achievement of cooperative outcomes. The inability to overcome resulting problems of collective action explains why many <b>regional</b> <b>initiatives</b> fail despite the support of all member governments. The thesis analyzes several different collective-action problems, using four initiatives of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) as case studies – involving trade liberalization, financial regulation, infrastructural development, and governance reform. The aim is not just to present a new theoretical perspective on regional cooperation in Africa, but also to illuminate the practical challenges that must be addressed if <b>regional</b> <b>initiatives</b> are to succeed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the process of {{establishment}} of a new Regional Electricity Market in South East Europe. This is an example of an intra-regional cooperation between the countries from the Western Balkans. In addition, the differences between this regional energy market and other Electricity <b>Regional</b> <b>Initiatives</b> in Europe up to date will be underlined, having in mind that the ultimate objective is that SEE REM shall be integrated into the internal energy market of the EU. So far, the <b>regional</b> <b>initiatives</b> covering the SEE countries in other fields have been characterized with a limited success {{due to the fact that}} most of these <b>regional</b> <b>initiatives</b> were initiated by external actors and a genuine will for cooperation between the SEE countries was missing in cases when an external incentive was lacking behind. Nevertheless, as it could be incurred from the existing successful REMs in other parts of Europe, the political will and dedication of the market players is essential for an effective integration of the national electricity markets. Even though the SEE REM was initiated as an idea of the EU and the Stability Pact, the development of the SEE REM in the framework of the Energy Community has been impressive in the short period of its existence. Despite the many remaining open issues before its effective functioning and integration with the other REMs in Europe, many steps and great reforms have been undertaken in electricity markets of the SEE countries at national but also at cross-border level. The clear enlargement perspective of the countries involved was the main incentive for reforms of the national electricity markets in SEE and for the establishment of the Energy Community. Therefore, this <b>regional</b> <b>initiative</b> is being transformed into regional cooperation seen more as an 'open regionalism' achieved from within the region and with regionally owned institutions and solutions for solving the regional problems. That is where the positive expectations for a success of the <b>regional</b> <b>initiative</b> between the SEE countries in the energy field, come from and that is why this article argues that the Energy Community is a positive example of a <b>regional</b> <b>initiative</b> for the SEE countries.
