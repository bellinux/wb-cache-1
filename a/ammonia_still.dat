5000|$|The [...] "gas nuisance" [...] {{was finally}} solved by the [...] "iron ore" [...] process. Enterprising gas-works {{engineers}} discovered that {{bog iron ore}} {{could be used to}} remove the sulfuretted hydrogen from the gas, and not only could it be used for such, but it could be used in the purifier, exposed to the air, whence it would be rejuvenated, without emitting noxious sulfuretted hydrogen gas, the sulfur being retained in the iron ore. Then it could be reinserted into the purifier, and reused and rejuvenated multiple times, until it was thoroughly embedded with sulfur. It could then be sold to the sulfuric acid works for a small profit. Lime was sometimes still used after the iron ore had thoroughly removed the sulfuret of hydrogen, to remove carbonic acid (carbon dioxide, CO2), the bisulfuret of carbon (carbon disulfide, CS2), and any <b>ammonia</b> <b>still</b> aeroform after its travels through the works. But it was not made noxious as before, and usually could fetch a decent rate as fertilizer when impregnated with ammonia. This finally solved the greatest pollution nuisances of the gas-works, but still lesser problems remained - not any that the purifier house could solve, though.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAqueous ammonia {{can be used}} {{to capture}} CO 2 from flue gas of coal -fi red power plant with {{acceptable}} CO 2 removal efficiency, high loading capacity of CO 2, low corrosion, low cost, and less degradation, and it could remove other acid gas pollutants at the same time. However, the CO 2 absorption rate and mass transfer in aqueous <b>ammonia</b> <b>still</b> need to study more deeply. The mass transfer characteristics of CO 2 in aqueous ammonia were investigated in this paper. A small wetted wall column (WWC) was used to study the kinetics of CO 2 absorbed in aqueous ammonia. The correlation of gas -side mass transfer coefficient kg was fitted as Sh= 3. 79 (Re×Sc×d/h) 0. 486 based on the experimental data of CO 2 absorption in 30 %wt MEA solution for this WWC reactor. The reaction rates of CO 2 in 1 wt%, 2. 5 wt%, 5 wt% to 7. 5 wt% aqueous ammonia were measured at the temperatures of 10  °C, 20  °C, 30  °Cto 40  °C, and the second-order reaction rate constant k 2 was calculated.

40|$|Field data on ammonia {{emission}} after liquid cattle manure (‘slurry’) application to grassland were statistically analysed {{to reveal the}} effect of manure and field characteristics and of weather conditions in eight consecutive periods after manure application. Logistic regression models, modelling the emission expressed {{as a percentage of}} the <b>ammonia</b> <b>still</b> present at the start of each period as the response variable, were developed separately for broadcast spreading, narrow band application (trailing shoe) and shallow injection. Wind speed, temperature, soil type, total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) content and dry matter content of the manure, application rate and grass height were selected as significant explanatory variables. Their effects differed for each application method and among periods. Temperature and wind speed were generally the most important drivers for emission. The fitted regression models were used to reveal seasonal trends in NH 3 emission employing historical meteorological data for the years 1991 – 2014. The overall average emission was higher in early and midsummer than in early spring and late summer. This seasonal trend was most pronounced for broadcast spreading followed by narrow band application, and was almost absent for shallow injection. However, due to the large variation in weather conditions, emission on a particular day in early spring can be higher than on a particular day in summer. The analysis further revealed that, in a specific scenario and depending on the application technique, emission could be reduced with 20 – 30 % by restricting manure application to favourable days, i. e. with weather conditions with minimal emission levels...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS Patients {{with chronic}} liver disease, yet without severe encephalopathy, {{were found to}} show {{evidence}} of increased brain utilization of glucose. The changes were abolished after an intra-venous infusion of 15 g ornithine alpha oxoglutarate, given {{over a period of}} 15 minutes. The possible implications of these observations are discussed. When ammonium salts were given intravenously to freely ventilating dogs to raise the blood ammonia to those levels found in hepatic encephalopathy, the glucose utilization of the brain was increased without similar increase in oxygen consumption. This rise in glucose utilization resulted in lactic acidosis and hyper-ventilation (James et al., 1974). The earliest disturbance of brain metabolism in patients with liver disease was an increase in the cerebral utilization of glucose at a time when oxygen consumption was little changed. Cere-bral blood flow initially was elevated (Porro et al., 1969). However, as the encephalopathy became more severe, oxygen and then glucose consump-tion of the brain, together with cerebral blood flow, decreased. These changes have been interpreted as showing evidence of anaerobic glycolysis (Alexander et al., 1965). Despite the fact that Fazekas et al. (1956) were unable to detect any correlation be-tween the changes in cerebral oxygen con-sumption and the elevation of blood ammonia in their patients, of all possible aetiological factors concerned in the genesis of encephalo-pathy, <b>ammonia</b> <b>still</b> {{remains one of the most}} favoured (Zieve, 1966).

Rat hippocampal neuronal and astrocytes co-cultures in vitro, fluorescent microscopy and perforated patch clamp were used to monitor the changes in intracellular Ca 2 +- and membrane potential produced by ammonium ions and various modulators in the cells implicated in neural networks. Low concentrations of NH 4 Cl (0. 1 - 4 mM) produce short temporal effects on network activity. Application of 5 - 8 mM NH 4 Cl: invariably transforms diverse network firing regimen to identical burst patterns, characterized by substantial neuronal membrane depolarization at plateau phase of potential and high-amplitude Ca 2 +-oscillations; raises frequency and average for period of oscillations Ca 2 +-level in all cells implicated in network; results in the appearance of group of «run out» cells with high intracellular Ca 2 + and steadily diminished amplitudes of oscillations; increases astrocyte Ca 2 +-signalling, characterized by the appearance of groups of cells with increased intracellular Ca 2 +-level and/or chaotic Ca 2 +-oscillations.

40|$|AbstractAqueous ammonia {{can be used}} {{to capture}} CO 2 from flue gas of {{coal-fired}} power plant with quick reaction rate, high removal efficiency, and high loading capacity of CO 2.

More research is necessary for these characters of ammonia solution as CO 2 absorbent. The paper will focus on the fundamental characteristics of CO 2 in aqueous ammonia. A series of tests were conducted in a semi-batch reactor that has been developed in this paper. CO 2 removal efficiencies at different concentrations of aqueous ammonia have been studied in the similar operation conditions to compare their basic characters in the CO 2 absorption process. And a small wetted wall column (WWC) with a contact area of about 41. 45  cm 2 was also built {{for the study of the}} absorption rate, diffusion, and solubility of carbon dioxide in the aqueous solution.

Here, we investigated the autotrophic nitrification activity of AOA and AOB in five strongly acidic soils (pH< 4. 50) during microcosm incubation for 30 days. Significantly positive correlations between nitrate concentration and amoA gene abundance of AOA, but not of AOB, were observed during the active nitrification. (CO 2) -C- 13 -DNA-stable isotope probing results showed significant assimilation of C- 13 -labeled carbon source into the amoA gene of AOA, but not of AOB, in one of the selected soil samples. High levels of thaumarchaeal amoA gene abundance were observed during the active nitrification, coupled with increasing intensity of two denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis bands for specific thaumarchaeal community. Addition of the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) completely inhibited the nitrification activity and CO 2 fixation by AOA, accompanied by decreasing thaumarchaeal amoA gene abundance. Bacterial amoA gene abundance decreased in all microcosms irrespective of DCD addition, and mostly showed no correlation with nitrate concentrations. Phylogenetic analysis of thaumarchaeal amoA gene and 16 S rRNA gene revealed active (CO 2) -C- 13 -labeled AOA belonged to groups 1. 1 a-associated and 1. 1 b.

40|$|As {{the first}} and rate-limiting step of nitrification, ammonia {{oxidation}} can be realized either by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) or archaea (AOA). However, the key factors driving the abundance, community structure and activity of <b>ammonia</b> oxidizers are <b>still</b> unclear, and {{the relative importance of}} AOA and AOB in ammonia oxidation is unresolved. In the present study, we examined the effects of long-term (6 years) nitrogen (N) addition and simulated precipitation increment on the abundance and community composition of AOA and AOB based on a field trial in a typical temperate steppe of northern China. We used combined approaches of quantitative PCR, terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and clone library analyses of amoA genes. The study objective was to determine (1) AOA and AOB diversity and activity in response to N addition and increased precipitation and (2) the relative contributions of AOA and AOB to soil ammonia oxidation in the typical temperate steppe. The results showed that the potential nitrification rate (PNR) increased with N addition, but decreased with increased precipitation. Both N addition and increased precipitation significantly increased AOB but not AOA abundance, and a significant correlation was only observed between PNR and AOB amoA gene copies. The T-RFLP analysis showed that both N and precipitation were key factors in shaping the composition of AOB, while AOA were only marginally influenced. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that all AOA clones fell within the soil and sediment lineage while all AOB clones fell within the Nitrosospira. The study suggested that AOA and AOB had distinct physiological characteristics and ecological niches. AOB were shown to be more sensitive to N and precipitation than AOA, and the ammonia oxidation process was therefore supposed to be mainly driven by AOB in this temperate steppe. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the physical environment on water and ammonia abundances across the S 140 photodissociation region (PDR) with an embedded outflow. We used the Odin satellite to obtain strip maps of the ground-state rotational transitions of ortho-water and ortho-ammonia, as well as CO(5 - 4) and 13 co(5 - 4) across the PDR, and H_ 2 ^ 18 O in the central position. A physi-chemical inhomogeneous PDR model was used to compute the temperature and abundance distributions for water, ammonia, and CO. A multi-zone escape probability method then calculated the level populations and intensity distributions. These results are compared to a homogeneous model computed with an enhanced version of the RADEX code. H_ 2 O, NH_ 3, and ^ 13 CO show emission from an extended PDR with a narrow line width of ~ 3 km/s. Like CO, the water line profile is dominated by outflow emission, but mainly in the red wing. Even though CO shows strong self-absorption, no signs of self-absorption are seen in the water line. The H_ 2 ^ 18 O molecule is not detected. The PDR model suggests that the water emission arises mainly from the surfaces of optically thick, high-density clumps with n(H_ 2) > 10 ^ 6 cm^- 3 and a clump water abundance, with respect to H_ 2, of 5 * 10 ^- 8. The mean water abundance in the PDR is 5 * 10 ^- 9 and between ~ 4 * 10 ^- 8 - 4 * 10 ^- 7 in the outflow derived from a simple two-level approximation. The RADEX model points to a somewhat higher average PDR water abundance of 1 * 10 ^- 8. At low temperatures deep in the cloud, the water emission is weaker, likely due to adsorption onto dust grains, while <b>ammonia</b> is <b>still</b> abundant. <b>Ammonia</b> is also observed in the extended clumpy PDR, likely from the same high density and warm clumps as water. The average ammonia abundance is about the same as for water: 4 * 10 ^- 9 and 8 * 10 ^- 9 given by the PDR model and RADEX, respectively. The differences between the models most likely arise from uncertainties in density,beam-filling, and volume-filling of clumps. The similarity of water and ammonia PDR emission is also seen in the almost identical line profiles observed close to the bright rim. Around the central position, ammonia also shows some outflow emission, although weaker than water in the red wing. Predictions of the H_ 2 O 1 (1, 0) - 1 (0, 1) and 1 (1, 1) - 0 (0, 0) antenna temperatures across the PDR are estimated with our PDR model for the forthcoming observations with the Herschel Space Observatory...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of hydrogen storage systems remains a grand technical challenge. The key issue {{is to find}} and synthesize materials with required physicochemical properties for hydrogen storage. Ammonia borane (AB) {{is considered to be}} one of the most promising candidates for a chemical method as it contains remarkable hydrogen content and is stable under normal storage conditions. This thesis focuses on synthesizing porous silica and carbon as nanoporous scaffolds for encapsulating AB and investigating the thermal decomposition performance of AB in the scaffolds with tunable pore structures and compositions. A systematical investigation has been carried out on the influence of trifluoroacetic acid, acetic acid and their salts on the synthesis of helical mesoporous materials in the presence of a cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a template. Results show that helical mesostructures can be successfully synthesized when CF₃COO⁻ anions were used as additives with an additive/CATB molar ratio (R) range of 0. 1 - 0. 375 for the CF₃COOH/CTAB templating system and a relatively wider R range of 0. 1 - 0. 5 for the CF₃COONa/CTAB templating system. Our synthesis strategy can be used for the fabrication of helical mesostructured porous materials with adjustable pore and helical pitch sizes. The influence of the time of 1, 3, 5 -trimethylbenzene (TMB) addition on the self-assembled organic/inorganic composite structures in a nonionic block copolymer templating system has been investigated. By controlling the time at which TMB is added to the system, an evolution from multilamellar vesicle to ordered hexagonal mesostructure has been observed, providing a simple and novel approach for the synthesis of self-assembled porous silica materials with adjustable structures and tunable pore sizes. In the {{development of}} porous carbon materials, a sol-gel polymerization induced colloid aggregation method is adopted with the use of a commercial polymeric melamine formaldehyde resin as nitrogen doped carbon precursor. The results show that the microstructure of porous carbon materials can be adjusted by polymerization of precursors and interposition of silica particles as a hard template. Moreover, the nitrogen content and functionality make the surface properties of the porous carbon unique and different from pure carbon materials. The presence of appropriate nitrogen functionalities can improve their behaviours and extend the application of porous carbon materials, such as electrode materials for double layer capacitors and catalytic materials for proton exchange membrane fuel cells. The thermal decomposition behaviour of AB confined in nanoporous scaffolds with controlled pore structures and wall compositions is investigated. The nanoporous scaffolds tested include Silica- 1 with a helical structure and a pore diameter of 1. 8 nm, Silica- 2 with a vesicular structure and a pore diameter of 18 nm, as well as a macroporous N-doped carbon sample synthesized using 250 nm silica particles as a hard template. It is shown that in the case of Silica- 1 with a small pore diameter of 1. 8 nm, AB cannot be efficiently impregnated into the nanopores and the thermal decomposition of AB is associated with the formation of volatile by-products. For Silica- 2 with a large pore diameter of 18 nm, it is a relatively better candidate compared to small pore Silica- 1 because the formation of most by-products is suppressed and the first hydrogen desorption peak is lowered by 13 °C compared to neat AB. However, a small amount of released <b>ammonia</b> is <b>still</b> observed. In the case of the macroporous N-doped carbon material, the total amount of hydrogen released is 6 wt...|$|R

Maximum rates of NH 4 + oxidation are considerably lower than in ammonia oxidizers, and the affinity for NH 4 + is generally lower than in ammonia oxidizers. NH 4 + does not apparently support growth in methanotrophs. Both ammonia monooxygenase and methane monooxygenase oxidize CO to CO 2, but CO cannot support growth in either ammonia oxidizers or methanotrophs. These organisms have affinities for CO which are comparable to those for their growth substrates and often higher than those in carboxydobacteria. The methane monooxygenases of methanotrophs exist in two forms: a soluble form and a particulate form. The soluble form is well characterized and appears unrelated to the particulate. Ammonia monooxygenase and the particulate methane monooxygenase share a number of similarities. Both enzymes contain copper and are membrane bound. They oxidize a variety of inorganic and organic compounds, and their inhibitor profiles are similar. Inhibitors thought to be specific to ammonia oxidizers have been used in environmental studies of nitrification. However, almost all of the numerous compounds found to inhibit ammonia oxidizers also inhibit methanotrophs, and most of the inhibitors act upon the monooxygenases. Many probably exert their effect by chelating copper, which is essential to the proper functioning of some monooxygenases. The lack of inhibitors specific for one or the other {{of the two groups}} of bacteria hampers the determination of their relative roles in nature...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} had the {{objective}} of evaluate the broiler litter treatment with active aluminosilicate {{in relation to the}} productive parameters of broiler chickens. Wes used 400 –day broiler-type (Ross 308) were grown in 8 floor pens each containing 50 birds (50 % males and 50 females), which were classified in two groups; 200 birds were raised on untreated litter with aluminosilicate (Group A) and the others 200 birds were raised on untreated litter(Group B). The productive performance of the birds, the ammonia concentrations, the atmospheric ph, the litter ph, the moisture ratio of the litter were analysed weekly. At the end of the trail was also evaluated the incidence of breast blisters and lesions on foot pads. The broilers raised on untreated litter had 0. 01 feed conversion ratio and 55 g. of body weight more than the broilers raised on treatment litter. No significant statistic difference were observed (p menor a 0. 05) in the productive parameters of both groups. No lesions on the breast were observed. The lesions in the foot pads were not significant statistically between the groups. The ammonia concentrations, the atmospheric ph, the litter ph were more in the groups with no treatment litter during the production period. The atmospheric ph showed significant statistic difference the 7, 14, 18, 21, 25 and 39 days of the productive period, while the litter ph showed this difference the 7, 14, 18, 21, 32 and 44 days. The European production index was a litter better on tiller treatment. The moisture ratios of the litter were constant in both groups and no significant difference they showed. The ammonia control with litter treatment for decrease the ammonia concentrations are being more popular in different countries. This treatment decreases the respiratory diseases and improves the salubrity and the broiler performance. In this study the treatment of the litter with aluminosilicate was effective to control the <b>ammonia</b> concentrations. <b>Still,</b> it did not have {{a significant difference in the}} productive parameters of the birds.

Este estudio tuvo como finalidad evaluar el efecto del tratamiento de la cama con un aluminosilicato activado sobre los parámetros productivos en pollos de carne criados sobre cama tratada y no tratada. Para esto se usó 400 pollos de carne (♂ y ♀) de la línea Ross 308; 200 fueron criadas sobre cama tratada con aluminosilicato (Grupo A) y 200 aves sobre cama no tratada (Grupo B). Semanalmente se analizó los parámetros productivos de las aves así como los niveles de amoniaco, pH atmosférico, pH de la cama, porcentaje de humedad de la cama. También se evaluó la presencia de lesiones a nivel de la pechuga y patas. Los pollos criados en cama no tratada obtuvieron 0. 01 más de índice de conversión alimenticia y 55 g. más de peso corporal comparado con las aves criadas sobre cama tratada con aluminosilicato, pero estas cifras no fueron diferentes estadísticamente (P menor a 0. 05) en relación a los parámetros productivos para ambos grupos. No se evidenció lesiones a nivel de la pechuga de los pollos. Las lesiones a nivel de las patas de los 2 grupos no fueron estadísticamente significativas. El nivel de amoniaco, pH atmosférico y pH de cama de cama fueron mayores en el grupo de aves criadas sobre cama no tratada. El pH atmosférico presentó diferencia estadística significativa a los 7, 14, 18, 21, 25, y 39 días de edad, mientras que el pH de cama a los 7, 14, 18, 21, 32 y 44 días. El índice de eficiencia productivo fue similar en ambos grupos. El control del amoniaco mediante tratamientos de cama se esta volviendo muy populares en diversos países del mundo ya que ha sido demostrado que contribuye a disminuir los problemas respiratorios y mejorar la sanidad y rendimiento de las aves. En el presente estudio el tratamiento de la cama con aluminosilicato fue efectivo en controlar los niveles de amoniaco, sin embargo esto no se reflejó estadísticamente a nivel de parámetros productivos en las aves.
