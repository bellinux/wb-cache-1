Although associational standing is in principle excluded under that provision, associations acting in the public interest may, under certain well-specified conditions, intervene before the Court of First Instance or the European Court of Justice, thus contributing – to the extent that these jurisdictions are competent – to the fully deliberative character of the judicial process, and ensuring that the Courts take into account the collective interests such associations seek to represent. Moreover, the current case-law of the European Courts considers that the right of certain organisations to be parties to administrative proceedings may justify according those organisations a right to file an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> the <b>annulment</b> of the act adopted on the basis of those proceedings, which may constitute an important incentive for the creation of associations and their active implication in the political or administrative decision-making process.

40|$|The {{right of}} private {{applicants}} to bring <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> in European Union courts is regulated by article 263 (4) TFEU. According to the article, private parties may bring <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> only in three situations. First, {{as stated in}} the first limb, they may institute proceedings against an act addressed to them. Second, the second limb enables instituting proceedings against an act, which is of direct and individual concern to them. The third limb and last possibility is to institute proceedings against a regulatory act, which is of direct concern to them and does not entail implementing measures. These limitations raise {{the question of whether the}} effective judicial protection is sufficiently ensured in the Union legal order. The principle of effective judicial protection is a general principle of Union law. It can be seen as one of the emanations of rule of law, which is a foundational value of the European Union. The principle is also laid down in article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which is inspired by articles 6 and 13 of the European Convention of Human Rights. The judicial protection in the European Union rests on two pillars: the Union remedies and the remedies before national courts. Although the European Union offers a complete legal system of legal remedies and procedures, the effectiveness of the alternative remedies is not always adequate. The Court of Justice of the European Union has consequently interpreted especially the criterion of individual concern strictly. However, it has used a more generous approach in the fields of competition, state aid, and anti-dumping. It seems like the Court has been more willing to safeguard the effectiveness of European Union law than the effective judicial protection of individuals. If the Union legal system wishes to be a modern, value-driven legal system that is accountable for its substance, it should match its effectiveness understanding with a right to effective judicial protection...|$|R

The case-law further shows that a Member State, such as the applicant in Case C‑475/10 P, may admissibly bring an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> of a measure producing binding legal effects without having to demonstrate that it has an interest in bringing proceedings....37 Where the <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> against an act adopted by an institution is brought by a natural or legal person, the Court of Justice had repeatedly held that the action lies only if the binding legal effects of that act are capable of affecting the interests of the applicant by bringing about a distinct change in his legal position (see, in particular, IBM v Commission, paragraph 9; Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, paragraph 29; Case C‑322/09 P NDSHT v Commission 2010 ECR I-0000, paragraph 45).38 It must, however, be emphasised that the case-law cited in the paragraph above was {{developed in the}} context of actions brought before the EU judicature by natural or legal persons against measures of which they were the addressees. Where, as in the case giving rise to the order in Deutsche Post v Commission, an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> is brought by a non-privileged applicant against a measure that has not been addressed to it, the requirement that the binding legal effects of the measure being challenged must be capable of affecting the interests of the applicant by bringing about a distinct change in his legal position overlaps with the conditions laid down in the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU....45 It follows from the above that a decision taken pursuant to Article 10(3) of Regulation No 659/1999 is intended to produce binding legal effects within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph 36 of this judgment, and therefore constitutes an act open to challenge for the purposes of Article 263 TFEU....53 Next, the case-law shows that an intermediate measure is also not capable of forming the subject-matter of an action if it is established that the illegality attaching to that measure can be relied on in support of an action against the final decision for which it represents a preparatory step. In such circumstances, the action brought against the decision terminating the procedure will provide sufficient judicial protection (IBM v Commission, paragraph 12; Case 53/85 AKZO Chemie and AKZO Chemie UK v Commission 1986 ECR 1965, paragraph 19; Case C-400/99 Italy v Commission 2001 ECR I 7303, paragraph 63).54 However, if that latter condition is not satisfied, it will be considered that the intermediate measure - independently of whether the latter expresses a provisional opinion of the institution concerned - produces independent legal effects and must therefore be capable of forming the subject-matter of an action for annulment....55 in this case, it must be held that an information under Article 10(3) of Regulation No 659/1999 produces independent legal effects....71 As for whether Deutsche Post is individually concerned by the act at issue, it should be recalled that, according to consistent case-law of the Court of Justice, persons other than those to whom a decision is addressed may claim to be individually concerned only if that decision affects them by reason of certain attributes which are peculiar to them or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons and, by virtue of those factors, distinguishes them individually just {{as in the case of}} the person addressed....73 in that respect, it should be noted that the fact that the act at issue is not addressed to Deutsche Post is irrelevant for assessing whether that undertaking is individually concerned by that measure, for the purposes of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU.74 Next, it must be noted that the information injunction refers to a procedure for examining a State aid measure from which Deutsche Post is alleged to have benefited. The information concerned by the act at issue concern only Deutsche Post. The latter is thus individually concerned by that measure for the purposes of the case-law cited in paragraph 71 of this judgment.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In Brazil, despite {{there being}} {{specific}} legislation regulating forced tax collection proceedings, these are still largely influenced by case law of national courts. We are {{now living in}} the third decade of Federal Law No. 6, 830, promulgated in 1980, which aimed to guarantee greater privileges to the treasury {{in the course of}} the debt collection saga. However, the many loopholes and lacunae gaping throughout the text have left all stakeholders – government, taxpayers and judges – somewhat exasperated. Part II of this Paper analyzes the main features of forced tax collection proceedings: registration of the tax liability, presumption of liquidity and certainty; definition of “responsible” persons in terms of the law; collateralization and challenges to the debt; and the tax liability vis-à-vis other debts. A brief look is given to other pieces of procedural legislation related to tax disputes, most importantly the suits for a writ of mandamus; <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> restoration of undue payments, and <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> <b>annulment.</b> Finally, summaries of case law of the Superior Court of Justice are considered.

40|$|From the Introduction. According to Article 220 of the EC Treaty, the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance (hereinafter CFI) “each {{within its}} jurisdiction, shall ensure {{that in the}} {{interpretation}} and application of [the EC] Treaty the law is observed”. The “pre-Nice” allocation of jurisdiction between the two Community courts can be summarized as follows. At Court of Justice level, mention should first of all be made of references for a preliminary ruling. A national court, in a case pending before it, can - or in some circumstances must - refer to the Court of Justice a question relating to the interpretation of provisions of the EC Treaty or of secondary Community law, or relating to the validity of provisions of secondary Community law. 1 Moreover, the Court of Justice ensures the observance {{of the law in}} the context of <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> or failure to act brought before it by the Community institutions, the European Central Bank (hereinafter ECB) and the Member States. 2 These actions concern, respectively, the legality of an act of secondary Community law and the legality of the failure of the institution concerned to adopt such act. The Court of Justice also has jurisdiction in actions brought by the Commission or by a Member State relating to the infringement of Community law by a Member State (hereinafter infringement actions) 3 and in actions relating to compensation for non-contractual damage brought by Member States against the Community. 4 Finally, as regards the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice, mention should be made of appeals which can be lodged on points of law only against rulings of the CFI. ...|$|R

Besides the applicant’s legal interest in bringing the <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>annulment,</b> which led to the dismissal, the Court {{had to deal with the}} situation of the applicant’s counsel in light of Article 17(2) of the Statute of the Court, according to which parties other than any EFTA State, ESA, the European Union and the Commission must be represented by a lawyer. The Court examined the relationship between the applicant and the two lawyers that signed the application. The independence of one lawyer was not found to be affected by her position as head of the Business Legislation Department of NHO as the Court had not been provided with information demonstrating that the interests of NHO were largely the same as those of the applicant. The other lawyer was also deemed sufficiently independent from the applicant as an employee of an independent law firm, from where she continued to receive her salary, regardless of a contract between NHO and the law firm for the temporary provision of her services. The applicant was thus found to be properly represented before the Court, showing that the right of audience of in-house counsel must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.|$|E

In the European Union it was of significant importance to create a system {{of control over the}} acts of the EU institutions given the democratic deficit within the Union and the limited supervisory role of the European Parliament. Binding acts of the EU institutions are subject to review through a number of routes provided by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and the Treaty on the European Union (TEU), namely <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> (Art. 263 TFEU), the plea of illegality (Art. 277 TFEU), the preliminary reference (Art. 267 TFEU) and the action for damages (Arts. 268 and 340 TFEU). The Court has consistently endeavoured to treat the several strands as a complex and coherent system of judicial review within the Union based on the rule of law. The <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> under Art. 263 TFEU plays a crucial role for individuals as it is in practice the only direct way open to individuals to challenge the acts of EU institutions.

In my opinion, the main reason consisted in tobacco companies and lobby groups activity. Adoption of tobacco directive was partly inevitable, but the above mentioned interest groups succeeded (via Germany) in limiting the directive's impact and postponing its adoption. Long-term and elaborated tobacco company's strategy succeeded in persuasion the German public. They, inter alia, indirectly force them to believe that tobacco industry is essential for the German economic growth. In my opinion, the strategy was successful because of its complexity and sophistication. Even though Germany was not successful before European Court of Justice with its second <b>action</b> <b>for</b> directive <b>annulment,</b> it still indirectly achieved to limit the directive impact and postponed its adoption for several years.

[...] "The dogma of absolute inviolability of the parliamentary assemblies has been breached. The parliamentary assemblies are now accountable not just to the electors but also to the courts.A first breach in the dogma of the inviolability of the assemblies was opened up by the Le Ski judgement of 27 May 1971, in which the Court of Cassation upheld the supremacy of the norm of self-executing international law.In 1980, Article 142 of the Constitution (former Article 107ter) established a Court of Arbitration in Belgium, nowadays the Constitutional Court, charged with hearing <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> of laws. It would hand down its first judgement on 5 April 1985. (...) A second breach was opened in the dogma of inviolability of the assemblies in Belgium by the Constitutional Court, in its judgement no. 31/96 of 15 May 1996. The Council of State, the highest administrative Court in Belgium, had till then always declared that it had no jurisdiction to hear annulment applications against the administrative acts by the Houses of Parliament. The Constitutional Court, declaring that the absence of any possibility to apply <b>for</b> the <b>annulment</b> of such acts was contrary to the constitutional principles of equality and non-discrimination, opened up a new avenue for judicial review of Parliament’s acts: the laws of 25 May 1999 and of 15 May 2007, adopted {{in the wake of the}} Court’s judgement, extended the jurisdiction of the Supreme Administrative Court to the acts and Rules of Procedure of the legislative assemblies or their organs with regard to public procurement and personnel (...) Finally, concerning the decisions taken by the assemblies with regard to MPs or political groups, the civil courts have not hesitated to sanction them when subjective rights were at stake. MPs [...] "enjoy the protection of their subjective rights by the law courts. This principle applies both for rights deriving from the law in the broad sense and for rights which have a regulatory basis" [...] (Civ. Brussels, 21 April 1997).".|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{relation}} between the <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> under Art 230 EC and the control of validity within the scope of the preliminary ruling procedure under Art 234 (1) (b) EC. Despite some fundamental differences between both procedures - Art 230 EC is a direct action before the community courts, while Art 234 EC is a procedure of co-operation between national courts and the ECJ - overlaps are possible: After expiration of the time-limit, pursuant to Art. 230 (5) EC, legal acts of community institutions become final. Yet, since the institution of a preliminary ruling procedure is not subject to any time-limit, such legal acts can be subject to a preliminary reference concerning their validity after the time limit pursuant to Art 230 (5) has already expired. Making a reference in favour of a person who could bring an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> against such an act but has failed to do so, would thus circumvent the finality of that act. For this reason the ECJ rejects references concerning the validity of acts under Art 234 EC, if an annulment action of the person in whose favour the reference is made was obviously admissible but no such action was brought.
