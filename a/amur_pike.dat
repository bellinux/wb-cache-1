50|$|Some <b>Amur</b> <b>pike</b> {{escaped from}} the Benner Spring Fish Hatchery where the {{original}} eggs and subsequent brood stock were hatched and kept. The hatchery is in the Delaware River watershed, so it's possible <b>Amur</b> <b>pike</b> could be present in that river system. However, none have ever been caught and no signs of reproduction of <b>Amur</b> <b>pike</b> in the wild in America has been documented, even in Glendale Lake.|$|E
5000|$|It is not {{commonly}} found outside its native range. However, {{it was introduced}} to Glendale Lake, Cambria County, Pennsylvania, by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission (PFBC) in 1968. The lake is {{just south of the}} native range of the northern pike. Pure <b>Amur</b> <b>pike</b> were last spawned in 1971. All of the Pennsylvania Fish Commission's brood stock was lost in the summer of 1976. That same year the world record <b>Amur</b> <b>pike</b> was caught from the lake. The year after, the PFBC also stocked 168 northern pike x <b>Amur</b> <b>pike</b> hybrids into the lake. With a lack of success, the <b>Amur</b> <b>pike</b> program was cancelled. Glendale Lake was chosen because its outflow leads into heavily polluted waters in which fish cannot survive. Pure northern pike are found in the lake today, however it is likely no pure or hybrid <b>Amur</b> <b>pike</b> remain.|$|E
5000|$|The most commercially {{important}} {{are the following}} types of Amur fish (Kaluga, carp, skygazer, Elopichthys Bambusa, tachysurus fulvidraco, <b>Amur</b> <b>pike,</b> snakehead, catfish) ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Amur</b> <b>pike,</b> {{also known}} as the blackspotted pike, (Esox reichertii) is a pike native to the Amur River system in east Asia, as well as {{freshwater}} habitat on the island of Sakhalin. [...] Closely related to the northern pike, it reaches a length of 115 cm (45 inches), a weight of 12.5 kg (27+ pounds), sporting a silvery body with small, black spots. Like other pike, this species is prized for sport fishing.|$|E
50|$|The Poronay River is crossed by {{only two}} bridges, one rail and one road bridge. Both bridges are {{next to each}} other, {{in the middle of}} the river between the towns of Pobedino and Pervomaisk. The river valley, {{especially}} the area between the downstream Poronay and the Deer River (a small river to the east), has many lakes. The Poronay river system is a rich breeding ground for salmon and other anadromous fish, as well as freshwater fish such as <b>Amur</b> <b>pike.</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Freshwater fishes of {{the genus}} Esox are found {{throughout}} the Holarctic region. The northern pike (E. lucius) has a circumpolar distribution whereas the assumed sister species the <b>Amur</b> <b>pike</b> (E. reichertii) is only found in the Amur region. The genetic structure and post-glacial dispersal of these species are not well known. Here, we use sequence variation at two mitochondrial DNA regions (cytb and D-loop) to investigate the phylogeography, infer location of glacial refugia and investigate the time of divergence and potential demographic expansion of the various clades detected. Results: The two species did not share haplotypes implying long-term isolation with no gene flow, and divergence of the taxa were estimated at 4. 55 Myr. The northern pike mtDNA haplotypes revealed three main lineages. One of the northern pike mtDNA lineages was found throughout the entire Holarctic region suggesting transcontinental dispersal from a single refugium. The three lineages exhibited a star phylogeny, indicating population expansion following isolation in separate glacial refugia. Estimated time of divergence of these lineages was 0. 18 Â¿ 0. 26 Myr. Conclusions: The precise location of the glacial refugia is uncertain, but our data suggests an Asian origin. The expansion of the circumpolar lineage {{is estimated to be}} around {{the end of the second}} glacial, implying that the current distribution is due to a recent recolonization from an east-Asian refugium. All three northern pike mtDNA lineages occurred sympatrically in Europe, possibly due to secondary contact. Two of the lineages probably originated from different European refugia, one in the Danube-region and one in Western Europe, the latter seems to be the primary source for recolonization of northern Europe...|$|E
