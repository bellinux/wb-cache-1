5|$|Head: The head {{should be}} broad with {{slightly}} pronounced eyebrows. The eyes should be kind and expressive. Appropriate eye colours are brown and hazel. The lining <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> should be black. The ears should hang {{close to the}} head and set slightly above the eyes.|$|E
5|$|The Sunda slow loris has dark rings {{around its}} large eyes, a white nose with a whitish strip that {{extends to the}} {{forehead}} and a dark stripe that stretches {{from the back of}} the head along the spine. Its soft, thick, woolly fur ranges from light brown to deep reddish brown, with a lighter underside. The species is distinct from the Bengal slow loris due to the dark inverse teardrop markings <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> which meet the dark dorsal stripe on the back of the head. It tends to have a much more distinct white stripe between the eyes, more distinct dark coloring <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> and a browner coat than the Bengal slow loris which is larger, grayer, and shows less contrast. The Sunda slow loris has less white facial coloring than the much smaller pygmy slow loris. Local color variations are known to occur.|$|E

5|$|Horses have a {{great sense}} of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly {{developed}} proprioception—the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times. A horse's sense of touch is well developed. The most sensitive areas are <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> ears, and nose. Horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} marine animals exist and rely, {{directly}} or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes penguins, blue whales, orcas, colossal squids and fur seals. The emperor penguin {{is the only}} penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the Adélie penguin breeds farther south than any other penguin. The southern rockhopper penguin has distinctive feathers <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. King penguins, chinstrap penguins, and gentoo penguins also breed in the Antarctic.|$|E
5|$|The Castillonais or Cheval Ariègeois de Castillon, {{once called}} the cheval du Biros or Saint-Gironnais, {{is an ancient}} breed of small riding horse from the Ariège département of southwestern France. The breed's {{phenotype}} is currently in flux, but overall it resembles (and is sometimes confused with) the more common Merens horse. Members of the breed are either dark bay or black, and all have pangare color modification, which results in paler color <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> and muzzle and {{on the underside of}} the body. Today it is used principally for pleasure riding (including equine tourism) and driving.|$|E

5|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey differs in coloration from South American {{squirrel monkey}}s. While South American squirrel monkeys {{tend to be}} primarily greenish in color, the Central American species has an orange back with olive shoulders, hips and tail and white undersides. The hands and feet are also orange. There is a black cap {{at the top of}} the head, and a black tip at the end of the tail. Males generally have lighter caps than females. The face is white with black rims <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> and black around the nose and mouth.|$|E
5|$|The Puerto Rican amazon (Amazona vittata), {{also known}} as the Puerto Rican parrot or iguaca, is the only extant bird endemic to the {{archipelago}} of Puerto Rico belonging to the Neotropical genus Amazona. Measuring , the bird is a predominantly green parrot with a red forehead and white rings <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes.</b> Two subspecies have been described, although there are doubts regarding the distinctiveness of the form gracilipes from Culebra Island, extinct since 1912. Its closest relatives are believed to be the Cuban amazon (Amazona leucocephala) and the Hispaniolan amazon (Amazona ventralis).|$|E
5|$|The {{juvenile}} {{resembles the}} adult in plumage, but the areas {{corresponding to the}} adult black feathers are browner and less glossy. The scapulars, wing and upper tail coverts have pale tips. The legs, bill and bare skin <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> are greyish green. It could possibly {{be confused with the}} juvenile yellow-billed stork, but the latter has paler wings and mantle, a longer bill and white under the wings.|$|E
50|$|Cluster {{headache}} (CH) is {{a neurological}} disorder characterized by recurrent, severe headaches {{on one side}} of <b>the</b> head, typically <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> There is often accompanying eye watering, nasal congestion, or swelling <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> on <b>the</b> affected side. These symptoms typically last 15 minutes to 3 hours. Attacks often occur in clusters which typically last for weeks or months and occasionally more than a year.|$|R
50|$|The male has {{a larger}} casque {{on a dark}} bill, and the culmen and lower {{mandible}} are yellowish. <b>The</b> bare skin <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> is dark in the male, but sometimes pale reddish in females. The female has a more yellowish bill with black on the basal half and on the casque.The juveniles lack the casque, and <b>the</b> bare skin <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> is dull orange.|$|R

5|$|Akodon caenosus is the {{smallest}} of the Argentine members of the A.boliviensis group–indeed, among {{the smallest}} of all species of Akodon. The upperparts are uniformly colored, but their tone is variable: generally ochraceous brown, but approaching yellow, red, or olivaceous in some individuals. Reddish tones occur mostly in lactating females. High-altitude animals are generally lighter, but there is also conspicuous variation within populations. The ears are similar to the upperparts, but some individuals have the sides more rich and clear in color. The underparts are clearly different in color, varying from light gray to yellowish or reddish. There are yellowish rings <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> which are more highly developed in high-altitude populations. There are white to yellowish hairs on the fore- and hindfeet. The tail is variably covered with hair and is dark brown above and white to buffy below.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban macaw had a red {{forehead}} fading {{to orange}} {{and then to}} yellow {{at the nape of}} the neck. It had white unfeathered areas <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> and yellow irises. The face, chin, chest, abdomen and thighs were orange. The legs were brown. The upper back was brownish red with feathers scalloped with green. The rump, undertail feathers, and lower back were blue. The wing feathers were brown, red and purplish blue. The upper surface of the tail was dark red fading to blue at the tip, and the under surface of the tail was brownish red. The beak has variously been described as dark, all-black, and greyish black. The sexes were identical in external appearance, as with other macaws.|$|E
5|$|The Limousin {{is a large}} framed {{breed of}} beef cattle with a bright wheat-coloured coat, not too dark, a little lighter on the belly, {{the rear of the}} thighs, between the legs, on the anus, around the {{testicles}} or udder, and the tail tip. Absence of any spots or pigmentation, with pink mucous membranes. Short head, broad forehead and muzzle, lighter area <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> and muzzle, fine horns curved forward and slightly raised at the tip (if present). Short neck. Chest broad and rounded. Side round. Pelvis wide, especially at the pin bones, not too inclined. Bones of lower back and hips slightly protruding. Forequarter well-muscled, wide above and very muscular. Hindquarters thick, deep and rounded. Horns and hooves lighter coloured. Correct limbs. Fine supple hide.|$|E

50|$|Periorbital {{cellulitis}}, {{also known}} as preseptal cellulitis (and {{not to be confused}} with orbital cellulitis, which is behind the septum), is an inflammation and infection of the eyelid and portions of skin <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> anterior to <b>the</b> orbital septum. It may be caused by breaks in <b>the</b> skin <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> and subsequent spread to the eyelid; infection of <b>the</b> sinuses <b>around</b> <b>the</b> nose (sinusitis); or from spread of an infection elsewhere through the blood.|$|R
5|$|The {{coloration}} of the upperparts {{is generally}} uniform, with some scattered darker hairs. There is a yellow ring <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{which is more}} prominent than in A.sylvanus. The underparts are not strongly demarcated from the upperparts in color and are yellow-brown to gray. There are some scattered white hairs on the chin. Although this white spot is better developed than in A.sylvanus, A.spegazzinii lacks the conspicuous white spot seen in A.simulator. The color of the feet ranges from white and yellow-brown to gray. Ungual tufts of hairs cover the claws; these hairs are grayish-brown at the bases and whitish at the tips. The amount of hair on the tail is variable, but it is dark brown above and white to yellow-brown below. High-altitude animals tend to have hairier ears and tails.|$|E
5|$|The white fur on {{the chin}} and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> is in sharp {{contrast}} with the black stripes on the face. The coat of males shows two-tone colouration: while the upper parts and outsides of the legs are dark brown to black, the underparts and the insides of the legs are all white. Darkness typically increases as the male ages. On the other hand, females and juveniles are yellowish fawn to tan. In Texas, blackbuck moult in spring, following which the males look notably lighter, though darkness persists on the face and the legs. On the contrary, males will grow darker as the breeding season approaches. Both melanism and albinism have been observed in wild blackbuck. Albino blackbuck are often zoo attractions as in the Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (Andhra Pradesh, India).|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus had {{a massive}} skull that could reach more than 1meter (3.3ft) in length. The bones were heavily {{constructed}} and some, including the nasal bones {{on top of}} the snout, were fused for strength. Large fenestrae (openings) in the skull reduced its weight. An adult Daspletosaurus was armed with about six dozen teeth that were very long but oval in cross section rather than blade-like. Unlike its other teeth, those in the premaxilla {{at the end of the}} upper jaw had a D-shaped cross section, an example of heterodonty always seen in tyrannosaurids. Unique skull features included the rough outer surface of the maxilla (upper jaw bone) and the pronounced crests <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> on the lacrimal, postorbital, and jugal bones. The orbit (eye socket) was a tall oval, somewhere in between the circular shape seen in Gorgosaurus and the 'keyhole' shape of Tyrannosaurus. Split carinae have been found on Daspletosaurus teeth.|$|E
50|$|It is 27-30 cm {{long with}} a {{wingspan}} of 60-68 cm. The upperparts are grey and the tail is dark. The underparts are whitish with dark grey streaks on {{the throat and}} upper breast and dark grey barring on the lower breast and belly. <b>The</b> feet, <b>eyes</b> and cere are yellow and there is bare yellow skin <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> Juvenile birds are browner than the adults with darker eyes and less bare skin <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|R

Later she meets other people in leather and masks, before being {{surrounded}} by a troop of lace-clad dancers. One shot shows a man in colourful clothes and leopard print Speedos surrounded by bubbles in a bathtub. Another room contains a family of four mannequins in a 1960s-styled kitchen, preparing for a plastic-looking meal. A bare African-American is seen dancing and painting herself with a large brush while being almost naked. She is also seen with her legs spread around a TV screen and Beyoncé is seen on it, singing the song. During one scene, Beyoncé performs a dance choreography on a couch along with several other female dancers. Throughout the video, she is seen wearing a tuxedo with a tie, a white fur jacket and platform heels designed by Saint Laurent. The black-and-white jumpsuit she wears is designed by Russian designer Ulyana Sergeenko. Her look is further complete with dark make-up <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> and red lipstick while her hair is marcelled and blonde.|$|E
5|$|P. sibiricus is {{the largest}} known species of Psittacosaurus. The skull of the type {{specimen}} is 20.7centimetres long (8.25in), and the femur is 22.3cm (8.75in) in length. It is also distinguished by its neck frill, which is longer than any other species, at 15 to 18% of skull length. A very striking feature of P. sibiricus {{is the number of}} 'horns' <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> with three prominences on each postorbital, and one in front of each eye, on the palpebral bones. Similar horns found on the postorbital of P. sinensis are not as pronounced but may be homologous. The jugal has extremely prominent 'horns' and may contact the premaxilla, both features also seen in the possibly related P. sinensis. There is a flange on the dentary of the lower jaw, similar to P. mongoliensis, P. meileyingensis, and P. sattayaraki. It can be told apart from the other species of Psittacosaurus by a combination of 32 anatomical features, including six that are unique to the species. Most of these are skull details, but one unusual feature is the presence of 23 vertebrae between the skull and pelvis, unlike the 21 or 22 in the other species where the vertebrae are known.|$|E
5|$|Since {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} extinct macaws exist only for the species on Cuba, {{it is impossible to}} determine the species' relationships. It has been suggested that the closest mainland relative of the Cuban macaw is the scarlet macaw (Ara macao), due to the similar distribution of red and blue in their plumage, and the presence of a white patch <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> naked except for lines of small red feathers. Furthermore, the range of the scarlet macaw extends to the margins of the Caribbean Sea. The Cuban macaw is distinct due to its lack of a yellow shoulder patch, its all-black beak, and its smaller size. The two also share a species of feather mite, which supports their relationship. James Greenway believed the scarlet macaw and the Cuban macaw formed a superspecies with the other extinct species suggested to have inhabited Jamaica, Hispaniola and Guadeloupe.|$|E
