50|$|Tadini was an Italian {{itinerant}} ophthalmologist {{who lived}} {{in the second half of}} the 18th century. Advertisements in old newspapers testify to the fact that he performed eye operations in many towns in Europe, including Lübeck and Ghent. Tadini had a box containing artificial lenses made of glass, which he showed to Giacomo Casanova. It is therefore probable that Tadini first conceived the idea of intraocular correction of <b>aphakia.</b> Presumably Casanova conveyed the idea to Casaamata, an ophthalmic surgeon in Dresden. At any rate, Casaamata was the first to actually attempt the correction of <b>aphakia</b> by implanting a lens.|$|E

50|$|The lens blocks most {{ultraviolet}} {{light in the}} wavelength range of 300-400 nm; shorter wavelengths are blocked by the cornea. High intensity {{ultraviolet light}} can harm the retina, and artificial intraocular lenses are therefore manufactured to also block ultraviolet light. People lacking a lens (a condition known as <b>aphakia)</b> perceive ultraviolet light as whitish blue or whitish-violet.|$|E
5000|$|Without the {{focusing}} {{power of}} the lens, the eye becomes very farsighted. This can be corrected by wearing glasses, contact lenses, or by implant of an artificial lens. Artificial lenses are described as [...] "pseudophakic." [...] Also, since the lens is responsible for adjusting the focus of vision to different lengths, patients with <b>aphakia</b> have a total loss of accommodation.|$|E
50|$|Babies {{are rarely}} born with <b>aphakia.</b> Occurrence most often results from {{surgery to remove}} {{congenital}} cataract (clouding of the eye's lens, which can block light from entering the eye and focusing clearly). Congenital cataracts usually develop {{as a result of}} infection of the fetus or genetic reasons. It is often difficult to identify the exact cause of these cataracts, especially if only one eye is affected.|$|E
5000|$|Convex {{aspheric}} curvatures {{are used}} in many presbyopic vari-focal lenses to increase the optical power over part of the lens, aiding in near-pointed tasks such as reading. The reading portion is an aspheric [...] "progressive add". Also, in <b>aphakia</b> or extreme hyperopia, high plus power aspheric lenses can be prescribed, but this practice is becoming obsolete, replaced by surgical implants of intra-ocular lenses. Many convex types of lens have been approved by governing agencies regulating prescriptions.|$|E
50|$|One {{cause of}} {{significant}} anisometropia and subsequent aniseikonia has been <b>aphakia.</b> Aphakic patients {{do not have}} a crystalline lens. The crystalline lens is often removed because of opacities called cataracts. The absence of this lens left the patient highly hyperopic (farsighted) in that eye. For some patients the removal was only performed on one eye, resulting in the anisometropia / aniseikonia. Today, this is rarely a problem because when the lens is removed in cataract surgery, an intraocular lens, or IOL is left in its place.|$|E
50|$|Humans cannot see {{ultraviolet}} light directly because {{the lens of}} the eye blocks most light in the wavelength range of 300-400 nm; shorter wavelengths are blocked by the cornea. The photoreceptor cells of the retina are sensitive to near {{ultraviolet light}} and people lacking a lens (a condition known as <b>aphakia)</b> see near ultraviolet light (down to 300 nm) as whitish blue, or for some wavelengths, whitish violet, probably because all three types of cones are roughly equally sensitive to ultraviolet light, but blue cones a bit more.|$|E
50|$|In 1993, {{there were}} 15,000 {{cataract}} surgeries performed in Nepal, only 1000 of which utilized intraocular lenses. Most of these 1000 modern surgeries were performed by HCP's Co-Director, Dr. Sanduk Ruit, who brought microsurgery with intraocular lens {{technology to the}} region. Before this technology, cataract surgery consisted of intracapsular cataract extraction, in which the entire lens and capsule are removed from the eye and the patient is given cumbersome thick eyeglasses that provide no peripheral vision and distorted direct vision. At that time, {{the second and third}} leading etiologies of blindness after cataracts were <b>aphakia</b> due to the loss of these thick glasses, and failed cataract surgery.|$|E
50|$|Deprivation {{amblyopia}} (amblyopia ex anopsia) {{results when}} the ocular media become opaque, such {{as is the}} case with congenital cataract or corneal haziness. These opacities prevent adequate visual input from reaching the eye, and disrupt development. If not treated in a timely fashion, amblyopia may persist even after the cause of the opacity is removed. Sometimes, drooping of the eyelid (ptosis) or some other problem causes the upper eyelid to physically occlude a child's vision, which may cause amblyopia quickly. Occlusion amblyopia may be a complication of a hemangioma that blocks some or all of the eye. Other possible causes of deprivation and occlusion amblyopia include obstruction in the vitreous and <b>aphakia.</b> Deprivation amblyopia accounts for less than 3% of all individuals affected by amblyopia.|$|E

Reindeer use near-UV radiation to see polar bears, who are poorly visible in regular light because they blend in with the snow. UV also allows mammals to see urine trails, which is helpful for prey animals to find food in the wild. The males and females of some butterfly species look identical to the human eye but very different to UV-sensitive eyes—the males sport bright patterns in order to attract the females.|$|E
50|$|The colour yellow, for example, is {{perceived}} when the L cones are stimulated {{slightly more than}} the M cones, and the colour red {{is perceived}} when the L cones are stimulated significantly more than the M cones. Similarly, blue and violet hues are perceived when the S receptor is stimulated more. Cones are most sensitive to light at wavelengths around 420 nm. However, the lens and cornea of the human eye are increasingly absorptive to shorter wavelengths, and this sets the short wavelength limit of human-visible light to approximately 380 nm, which is therefore called 'ultraviolet' light. People with <b>aphakia,</b> a condition where the eye lacks a lens, sometimes report {{the ability to see}} into the ultraviolet range. At moderate to bright light levels where the cones function, the eye is more sensitive to yellowish-green light than other colors because this stimulates the two most common (M and L) of the three kinds of cones almost equally. At lower light levels, where only the rod cells function, the sensitivity is greatest at a blueish-green wavelength.|$|E
50|$|Multifocal glued IOLs {{have been}} done with the ReZoom (Abbott Medical Optics), and Tecnis (Advanced Medical Optics or AMO) IOLs. This makes it {{possible}} to offer the accommodative IOL advantage even to patients with an absent capsule. The modified Prolene polyvinylidene fluoride haptic in these IOLs helps in being more stiff as well as having superior memory. Sutured scleral-fixated IOLs in pediatric eyes have been known to be associated with problems.Multifocal IOLs allow good vision at a range of distances. Monofocal intraocular lenses which are commonly available give clear point of focus in the distance or closer, but you can choose only one focal point. Multifocal intraocular lenses are designed to avoid the need for glasses by providing two or more points of focus. These intraocular lenses are intended to be placed in the capsular bag. Until recently, it was difficult to provide multifocality for patients who had complicated cataract surgeries which lack normal capsules. <b>Aphakia</b> with deficient capsule has been a limitation for obtaining multifocality. Now multifocality is possible even in complicated cataract surgeries by the Multifocal Glued IOL procedure. In this multifocal IOL implantation is done even in eyes with large posterior capsular rupture (PCR) and aphakias with deficient posterior capsule.|$|E
50|$|Normal human lens {{is placed}} inside a capsular bag by nature. During trauma, surgery or {{sometimes}} by genetic cause the bag is damaged, weak or absent. Under this condition, one cannot place a normal intraocular lens (IOL) in the bag. To overcome this problem, {{the technique of}} glued IOL was introduced by Prof Amar Agarwal in 2007, December for lens implantation in eyes with the absent or deficient capsular bag.9,10 Here 2 scleral flaps about 180 degrees apart are made and the IOL is inserted through the corneal incision (Fig 3). After making the sclerotomy below the flaps, the haptics are externalized and tucked in a scleral tunnel {{at the point of}} exit. Maggi and Maggi in 1997 were the first to report sutureless scleral fixation of a special IOL. Gabor Scharioth and Pavilidis in 2006 reported the scleral tuck and intrascleral haptic fixation of a posterior chamber Intra ocular lens (PC IOL). Fibrin glue is applied for apposing the flaps and conjunctiva. PDEK can be combined or performed simultaneously with glued IOL implantation in eyes with existing corneal decompensation with <b>aphakia,</b> IOL decenteration or dislocated lens. Sometimes, one may require removal of the existing lens (as in Anterior Chamber IOL) and replacement with the other by this method. So far we have seen good anatomical and functional outcome in combined PDEK with glued IOL (Fig 4).|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} {{incidence}} of <b>aphakia</b> after cataract surgery, the surgical complications {{that can lead to}} it, and the visual outcome. Setting: Six community-run eye clinics participating in the Swedish National Cataract Register. Methods: Data on cataract extractions were collected prospectively from 1997 through 2001. The data also covered the type of surgery and type of intraocular lens, including a "no lens implanted" option. All data were stored in a database. These data were supplemented with data on the intended type of surgery, type of complications, possible second surgery, and visual outcome. Results: The overall incidence of postoperative <b>aphakia</b> was 0. 65 %. In 87. 1 % of cases, the <b>aphakia</b> was not planned, corresponding to an incidence of 0. 48 %. Unplanned <b>aphakia</b> was significantly related to poor preoperative vision, old age, and the presence of ocular comorbidity. The most frequent reasons for unplanned <b>aphakia</b> were intraoperative capsule problems and vitreous loss. In two thirds of cases, a second operation was performed. In 41 % of all cases, the final visual acuity was 0. 5 or better and in 27. 7 %, worse than 0. 1. Conclusions: During the study period, 1 of every 200 routine cataract surgeries ended in unplanned <b>aphakia.</b> The incidence of surgical complications leading to unplanned <b>aphakia</b> and a final visual acuity worse than 0. 1 (20 / 200) was 7. 8 per 10 000 operations in cases with no ocular comorbidity and 27. 6 per 10 000 operations in cases with ocular comorbidity.
