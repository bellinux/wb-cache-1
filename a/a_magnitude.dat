5|$|By 6May, a {{total of}} five light {{aftershocks}} had occurred near the earthquake's epicenter. Of the five, the first registered <b>a</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 3.7(ML) and struck about 15 minutes after the main shock, and was succeeded by <b>a</b> <b>magnitude</b> 3.9(ML) tremor at 10:09 local time. Two similar quakes of minor intensity struck the region the next day; however, the strongest and final aftershock registered <b>a</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 4.1(ML) and occurred at 04:00 in the morning.|$|E

5|$|The June 2011 Christchurch {{earthquake}} was {{a shallow}} magnitude 6.3 ML earthquake that occurred on 13 June 2011 at 14:20 NZST (02:20 UTC). It was centred {{at a depth}} of 6km (3.8mi), about 10km (6mi) from Christchurch, which had previously been devastated by another magnitude 6.3 ML earthquake in February 2011. The June quake was preceded by <b>a</b> <b>magnitude</b> 5.9 ML tremor that struck the region at a slightly deeper 8.9km (5.5mi).

5|$|Alpha Apodis is {{an orange}} giant of {{spectral}} type K3III located 447 ± 8 {{light years away}} from Earth, with an apparent magnitude of 3.8. It spent much of its life as a blue-white (B-type) main sequence star before expanding, cooling and brightening as it used up its core hydrogen. It has swollen to 48 times the Sun's diameter, and shines with a luminosity approximately 928 {{times that of the}} Sun, with a surface temperature of 4312 K.

Gamma Apodis is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III located 156 ± 1 light-years away, with <b>a</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 3.87. It is approximately 63 times as luminous the Sun, with a surface temperature of 5279 K. Delta Apodis is a double star, the two components of which are 103 arcseconds apart and visible through binoculars. Delta1 is a red giant star of spectral type M4III located 760 ± 30 light years away. It is a semiregular variable that varies from magnitude +4.66 to +4.87, with pulsations of multiple periods of 68.0, 94.9 and 101.7 days.

5|$|Buildings swayed {{with the}} tremor in Mexico City, {{prompting}} evacuations and causing panic among many. Following the quake, police patrolled city streets for safety reasons and damage assessments {{were carried out}} across the affected region.

A number of light aftershocks succeeded the main event, of which the strongest measured <b>a</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 4.1(ML).|$|E
5|$|Canis Minor {{contains}} only two stars {{brighter than the}} fourth magnitude, Procyon (Alpha Canis Minoris), with <b>a</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 0.34, and Gomeisa (Beta Canis Minoris), with <b>a</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 2.9. The constellation's dimmer stars were noted by Johann Bayer, who named eight stars including Alpha and Beta, and John Flamsteed, who numbered fourteen. Procyon is the seventh-brightest star in the night sky, {{as well as one}} of the closest. A yellow-white main sequence star, it has a white dwarf companion. Gomeisa is a blue-white main sequence star. Luyten's Star is a ninth-magnitude red dwarf and the Solar System's next closest stellar neighbour in the constellation after Procyon. The fourth-magnitude HD 66141, which has evolved into an orange giant towards the end of its life cycle, was discovered to have a planet in 2012. There are two faint deep sky objects within the constellation's borders. The 11 Canis-Minorids are a meteor shower that can be seen in early December.|$|E
5|$|Close to Gamma Corvi {{and visible}} in the same {{binocular}} field is R Corvi, a long period (Mira) variable star. It ranges in brightness from <b>a</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 6.7 to 14.4 with a period of approximately 317 days. TT Corvi is a semiregular variable red giant of spectral type M3III and apparent magnitude 6.48 around 923 light years distant. It is around 993 times as luminous as the Sun.

5|$|Corvus {{contains}} no Messier objects. It has several galaxies and a planetary nebula observable with amateur telescopes. The center of Corvus {{is home to}} a planetary nebula, NGC 4361.

5|$|From Jupiter's surface—or rather, {{from just}} above its cloudtops—Amalthea would appear very bright, shining with <b>a</b> <b>magnitude</b> of −4.7, {{similar to that}} of Venus from Earth. At only 8 arcminutes across, its disc would be barely discernible. Amalthea's orbital period is only {{slightly}} longer than its parent planet's day (about 20% in this case), which means it would cross Jupiter's sky very slowly. The time between moonrise and moonset would be over 29 hours.|$|E
5|$|Its {{size and}} unusually bright surface make Vesta the {{brightest}} asteroid, {{and it is}} occasionally {{visible to the naked}} eye from dark skies (without light pollution).

Theta Pyxidis is a red giant of spectral type M1III and semi-regular variable with two measured periods of 13 and 98.3 days, and an average magnitude of 4.71, and is 500 ± 30 light-years distant from Earth.

5|$|NGC 1664 is {{a fairly}} large open cluster, with a {{diameter}} of 18 arcminutes, and moderately bright, with <b>a</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 7.6, comparable to several other open clusters in Auriga.

5|$|On March 30, 2014, <b>a</b> <b>magnitude</b> 4.8 {{earthquake}} struck {{almost the}} very middle of Yellowstone near the Norris Basin at 6:34 am; reports indicated no damage. This {{was the largest}} earthquake to hit the park since February 22, 1980.|$|E
5|$|Seismologists {{reported}} that the earthquakes {{were part of a}} prolonged aftershock sequence associated with the major magnitude 7.1 earthquake of September 2010, which includes the February 2011 event. They were succeeded by multiple lighter aftershocks; the strongest, a moderate magnitude 5.1 ML struck a minute after the event. Another tremor 5.0 ML struck the region two days later. Despite significant energy release, the earthquakes were believed to have increased the risk of an additional aftershock of similar magnitude; calculations from GNS Science indicated a 23 percent probability of <b>a</b> <b>magnitude</b> 6.0–6.9 ML earthquake occurring in the Canterbury aftershock zone within the 12 months following the event. Weeks later, <b>a</b> <b>magnitude</b> 5.4 ML tremor jolted Christchurch overnight on 22 June, causing additional damage and prompting evacuations.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the more}} {{prominent}} double stars include Gamma Coronae Australis—a pair of yellowish white stars 58 light years away from Earth, which orbit each other every 122 years. Widening since 1990, the two stars {{can be seen as}} separate with a 100mm aperture telescope; they are separated by 1.3 arcseconds at an angle of 61 degrees. They have a combined visual magnitude of 4.2; each component is an F8V dwarf star with <b>a</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 5.01. Epsilon Coronae Australis is an eclipsing binary belonging to a class of stars known as W Ursae Majoris variables. These star systems are known as contact binaries as the component stars are so close together they touch. Varying by a quarter of <b>a</b> <b>magnitude</b> around an average apparent magnitude of 4.83 every seven hours, the star system lies 98 light years away. Its spectral type is F4VFe-0.8+. At {{the southern end of the}} crown asterism are the stars Eta¹ and Eta² Coronae Australis, which form an optical double. Of magnitude 5.1 and 5.5, they are separable with the naked eye and are both white. Kappa Coronae Australis is an easily resolved optical double—the components are of apparent magnitudes 6.3 and 5.7 and are 1700 and 490 light years away respectively. They appear at an angle of 359 degrees, separated by 21.6 arcseconds. Kappa² is actually the brighter of the pair and is more bluish white, with a spectral type of B9V, while Kappa¹ is of spectral type A0III. Lying 202 light years away, Lambda Coronae Australis is a double splittable in small telescopes. The primary is a white star of spectral type A2Vn and magnitude of 5.1, while the companion star has <b>a</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 9.7.

5000|$|Thus in 1856 Norman Pogson of Oxford {{proposed}} that a logarithmic scale of [...] ≈ 2.512 be adopted between magnitudes, so five magnitude steps corresponded precisely to {{a factor of}} 100 in brightness.
