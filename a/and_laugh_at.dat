5|$|Kelly {{admits to}} some problems, while making excuses for her boyfriend, {{such as his}} busy {{schedule}} and her own moodiness. Beyoncé, however, rolls her eyes at the thin excuses, and assures Kelly that she and Michelle love her and she does not need not to suffer alone. At this, Kelly begins to cry <b>and</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> the same time. Michelle goes on to tell her of the day she confronted her boyfriend {{when she saw him}} browsing through jewelry with another woman. During the last minute of the video, Kelly can seen be seen looking cold and angry as her boyfriend comes home. He arrives apologetic, but she perks up, dangling a pair of fuzzy handcuffs. He smiles and begins to follow her upstairs. In the following scene, he is naked except for a pair of boxers (in some versions, his rear-end is blurred out) and handcuffed to the balcony. With her bags packed and the handcuff key in hand, she leaves—laughing happily leaving her partner shocked and angry. The girls are finally seen walking down the city street, holding hands, as an image of the album cover of Destiny Fulfilled passes by on a city bus.|$|E
25|$|Belvile, Willmore, Frederick, and Pedro {{break into}} Blunt's room <b>and</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> him. Blunt says {{that just a}} moment {{before there was a}} wench in his chamber and shows them the ring Florinda gave him. Belvile recognizes the ring as the one he gave Florinda when they {{exchanged}} vows. The other men, unaware that the girl is Florinda, decide to let her out and have their way with her. They draw swords to see who has the longest. Don Pedro wins and unlocks Florinda's door.|$|E
25|$|David Bevington {{argues that}} the play {{represents}} {{the dark side of}} love. He writes that the fairies make light of love by mistaking the lovers and by applying a love potion to Titania's eyes, forcing her {{to fall in love with}} an ass. In the forest, both couples are beset by problems. Hermia and Lysander are both met by Puck, who provides some comic relief in the play by confounding the four lovers in the forest. However, the play also alludes to serious themes. At the end of the play, Hippolyta and Theseus, happily married, watch the play about the unfortunate lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe, and are able to enjoy <b>and</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> it. Helena and Demetrius are both oblivious to the dark side of their love, totally unaware of what may have come of the events in the forest.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Paul Feig, making it his sixth directorial credit for the series. Eisenberg and Stupnitsky later noted that, because the episode {{was the first to}} be filmed following the strike, there was [...] "a great, loose vibe on set", and as such, many of the actors would break character <b>and</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> the jokes. The majority of the episode took place at Michael's condo. This was the same location used in the second season entry [...] "Office Olympics". Eisenberg and Stupnitsky explained that [...] "the production design team did an amazing job to transform the condo from Michael's design aesthetic to Jan's." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{town meeting}} {{attracted}} a packed crowd of over a thousand, with Nixon supporters distributing anti-Voorhis literature at the door. The Senate proxies spoke first for their candidates, followed by Voorhis. Nixon, who had notified organizers {{that he would}} be late due to another commitment, arrived during Voorhis's speech, and remained backstage until the congressman had completed his talk. He then came onstage, shook hands with Voorhis, and delivered a fifteen-minute address. A question-and-answer period then followed, with a Nixon supporter asking Voorhis about his onetime Socialist registration, and about his views on monetary policy. [...] After the representative responded, a Voorhis supporter asked Nixon why he was making [...] "false charges" [...] about the supposed Voorhis CIO-PAC endorsement. [...] In response, Nixon reached into his pocket and pulled out a copy of a Southern California NCPAC bulletin mentioning the group's endorsement of Voorhis. [...] The congressman was unaware of the endorsement; those of his aides in the know had [...] "completely forgotten" [...] to tell him. [...] Nixon walked halfway across the stage and displayed it to Voorhis, asking him to read it for himself. Voorhis came from his seat and took it, and (according to Bullock, who served as timekeeper at the debate) [...] "mumbled" [...] that this seemed to be a different organization from the CIO-PAC. [...] Nixon reclaimed the document, and began to read out names {{of the members of the}} boards of directors of the two groups, [...] "It's the same thing, virtually, when they have the same directors." [...] The crowd began to cheer Nixon, who later wrote, [...] "I could tell by the audience reaction that I had made my point", and to jeer Voorhis, who wrote, [...] "They'd boo <b>and</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> my remarks, and this disturbed me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Among {{those who}} earned their {{living in the}} streets of London, the more criticized were the hackney coach drivers. Moreton defines them [...] "the scum of the people, and, {{generally}} speaking, the worst of rogues", robbing their customers on a regular basis, and often in league with highway robbers. Hackney coach travellers were generally at the mercy of their carriers, and even the simplest travel could easily turn into a real danger. Even the most [...] "honest" [...] among them were used to rework the city routes and rates as they pleased in order to increase their profits. Hackney coach drivers were so severely criticized for being rude and abusive, that in 1682 the Common Council had to pass an act for their regulation aiming: to limit their number, to establish a valid licence and a fair charge, and to set out places where they could wait for hire. Moreton brings the attention of the reader on a technicality that might explain why these drivers most of the time managed to walk unpunished. As a matter of fact, the renter of the coach rarely appears to be the actual driver (although they might be in league), therefore [...] "the penalty, which used to be on the renter, being now on the driver, the renter or owner of that figure is clear, and the driver has nothing to do but to be absent <b>and</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> the complainant". For this reason, the law needs to be amended so that both the driver and the renter (for Moreton equally guilty) might be accountable for extortion, insolence, or offences. In addition, the renter should be obliged to register and respond for the behaviour of the driver he rented his coach to.|$|E

60|$|The {{closing of}} the ---- Congress was not unlike the {{closing of the}} several {{preceding}} Congresses. There was the same unbusiness-like, impractical haste; the same hurried, unjust, and utterly inadequate adjustment of unfinished, ill-digested business, {{that would not have been}} tolerated for a moment by the sovereign people in any private interest they controlled. There were frauds rushed through; there were long-suffering, righteous demands shelved; there were honest, unpaid debts dishonored by scant appropriations; there were closing scenes which only the saving sense of American humor kept from being utterly vile. The actors, the legislators themselves, knew it, <b>and</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> it; the commentators, the Press, knew it <b>and</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> it; the audience, the great American people, knew it <b>and</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> it. <b>And</b> nobody for an instant conceived that it ever, under any circumstances, might be otherwise.|$|R
