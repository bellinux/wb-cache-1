5|$|Breath-hold diving by an {{air-breathing}} {{animal is}} limited to the physiological capacity to perform the dive on the oxygen available until it returns to a source of fresh breathing gas, usually the <b>air</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> surface. As this internal oxygen supply reduces, the animal experiences an increasing urge to breathe caused by buildup of carbon dioxide and lactate in the blood, followed by loss of consciousness due to central nervous system hypoxia. If this occurs underwater, it will drown.|$|E

5|$|Over {{elevated}} surfaces, heating of {{the ground}} exceeds the heating of the surrounding <b>air</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same altitude above sea level, creating an associated thermal low over the terrain and enhancing any thermal lows that would have otherwise existed, and changing the wind circulation of the region. In areas where there is rugged topography that significantly interrupts the environmental wind flow, the wind circulation between mountains and valleys {{is the most important}} contributor to the prevailing winds. Hills and valleys substantially distort the airflow by increasing friction between the atmosphere and landmass by acting as a physical block to the flow, deflecting the wind parallel to the range just upstream of the topography, which is known as a barrier jet. This barrier jet can increase the low level wind by 45%. Wind direction also changes because of the contour of the land.|$|E
5|$|The SABRE engine design aims {{to avoid}} the {{historic}} weight-performance issue by {{using some of the}} liquid hydrogen fuel to cool helium within a closed-cycle precooler, which quickly reduces the temperature of the <b>air</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> inlet. The air is then used for combustion in a similar manner to a conventional jet engine; once the helium has left the pre-cooler, it is further heated by the products of the pre-burner, giving it enough energy to drive the turbine and the liquid hydrogen pump. As a consequence of the air being cooled at all speeds, the jet can be built of light alloys and the weight is roughly halved. Additionally, more fuel can be burnt at high speeds. Beyond Mach5.5, the air would normally become unusably hot despite the cooling; accordingly, the air inlet is closed upon attaining this speed and the engine instead is solely fed via on-board liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel, as in a traditional rocket.|$|E
