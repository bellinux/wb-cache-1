40|$|Summary. A piloted flight {{simulator}} {{study of the}} low speed handling of the BAC 221 slender-wing research aircraft was performed for validation of the simulation of slender-wing supersonic transport aircraft. The lateral representation of the aircraft was satisfactory, and lateral control problems experienced on the real <b>aircraft</b> at high <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> were reproduced on the simulator and investigated in more detail than would be practicable in flight. There were several discrepancies in the longitudinal characteristics of the simulation, some {{of which can be}} attributed to inadequate representation of visual cues: satisfactory explanation of other discrepancies has not yet been obtained but a further simulation may resolve these problems. Sidestep manoeuvres and crosswind landings were studied, and the overall quality of the simulation is discussed in relation to previous supersonic transport aircraft simulations...|$|R

40|$|The basic {{principle}} of the improved passive flux sampler {{has been reported in}} a companion paper. In the present paper, the performance of different types of the sampler as a function <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> airflow was studied in a wind tunnel. The following types of sampler were examined: a basic straight sampler (220 mm long); straight samplers (220 mm long) with openings that had been modified in one of several different ways, all aimed at reducing turbulence around the openings and thus achieving nearer-to-perfect performance as <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> changed; a cranked sampler, designed to reduce the distance between the planes of the two openings to 80 mm (type useful in confined spaces); and two types of sampler (dual curved and angular) for both of which the two openings are in the same plane, albeit offset transversely (useful for space-boarded buildings). The dependency on the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> the different sampler types was compared by measuring the pressure drop across the sampler, and hence calculating a normalised air velocity through each sampler's precision central orifice for each <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence.</b> Ideal performance would yield a cosine relationship between air velocity through the sampler and <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence.</b> Any deviations from such a cosine relationship imply a potential under- or over-estimation of ammonia flux rate, the magnitude of which depends on the relative persistence <b>of</b> the relevant <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> during the exposure period of the sampler. The closest approach to ideal performance as <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> changes was achieved by the straight sampler modified by the addition of solid tear-drop shapes around both its openings. However, the overall length of the straight sampler means that it is not suitable for all sampling scenarios. For confined spaces e. g. complex geometries in the roof ridges of livestock buildings, the cranked sampler is more suitable, accepting that it does not so closely approach ideal performance as the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> changes. Likewise, the dual curved and angular samplers are more suitable for ammonia fluxes through space-boarded walls or similar: in both the above scenarios, non-ideal performance is mitigated by the fact that, with defined air pathways in the roof ridge, and with a space-boarded wall of finite thickness, respectively, the range <b>of</b> <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> likely to be seen by the cranked, dual curved and angular samplers is generally limited to angles near to 0 or 180 °...|$|R
