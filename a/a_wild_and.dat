5|$|In the arts, Romanticism {{manifested}} itself in literature and drama in {{the adoption of the}} mythical bard Ossian, the exploration of national poetry in the work of Robert Burns and in the historical novels of Walter Scott. Scott also had a major impact on the development of a national Scottish drama. Art was heavily influenced by Ossian and a new view of the Highlands as the location of <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>and</b> dramatic landscape. Scott profoundly affected architecture through his re-building of Abbotsford House in the early nineteenth century, which set off the boom in the Scots Baronial revival. In music, Burns was part of an attempt to produce a canon of Scottish song, which resulted in a cross fertilisation of Scottish and continental classical music, with romantic music becoming dominant in Scotland into the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Sheriff Hill, Carr Hill and Low Fell, Deckham's {{history is}} sparsely recorded. It {{indicates}} that, {{by the middle}} of the 19th century, there was a small settlement which was part of Gateshead Fell; <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>and</b> treacherous area of common land notable for the criminality of the tinkers and hawkers who lived there. Ordnance survey mapping illustrates the sparsity of buildings in 1860; the area contained little except Deckham Hall, a few other dwellings and two public houses at the point where the old turnpike road branched off towards Carr's Hill. The two public houses were the 'Speed the Plough' and 'The Ship'.|$|E

25|$|Local {{legend has}} it that Shovell was alive, at least barely, when he reached the shore of Scilly at Porthellick Cove but was murdered by a woman {{for the sake of his}} priceless emerald ring, which had been given to him by a close friend, Captain James Lord Dursley. At that time, the Scillies had <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>and</b> lawless reputation. It is claimed that the murder came to light only some thirty years later when the woman, on her deathbed, confessed to a clergyman to having killed the admiral and {{produced}} the stolen ring, which was sent back to Dursley. Several historians doubt the murder story as there is no indication that the ring was recovered and the legend stems from a romantic and unverifiable deathbed confession.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>wild</b> <b>and</b> dreary country; {{there is}} a great deal of poor land in it, covered with broom, and several wastes or little commons, with cottages {{interspersed}} among them. The soil of it is in general a stiff clay, and in some parts mixed with gravel, the water throughout it is very brackish. The southern part of it is mostly coppice woods, a considerable quantity of which belong to the archbishop. and are in his own occupation. There are thirty-seven teams kept in this parish. There are about seventeen acres of hops in it, and not long ago double that number, and these are continually displanting. It also produces much canary-seed, of which it has sometimes had one hundred acres... Northward from (Herne) is Underwood farm, and opposite to it the parsonagehouse, formerly the residence of the Milles's. These are within the hamlet of Eddinton, in which, further on upon the road, is a new-built house, belonging to Mr. Edward Reynolds.|$|E

The California Water Impact Network stated channel rehabilitation was [...] "an activity equivalent to a clear-cut on <b>a</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>and</b> Scenic River." [...] Bulldozing of the riverbanks to clear space for juvenile salmon habitat has harmed steelhead spawning grounds, impacted public access and allowed the spread of invasive plant species.

500|$|Many historians, notably Hugh Trevor-Roper, have {{suggested}} that the witch trials of the 16th and 17th centuries were a consequence of the religious struggles of the period, with both the Catholic and Protestant Churches determined to stamp out what they regarded as heresy. The trial of the Samlesbury witches is perhaps one clear example of that trend; it has been described as [...] "largely a piece of anti-Catholic propaganda", and even as a show-trial, to demonstrate that Lancashire, considered at that time to be <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>and</b> lawless region, was being purged not only of witches but also of [...] "popish plotters" [...] (i.e. recusant Catholics).|$|E

500|$|Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide {{said that}} {{although}} [...] "30 Rock gave us yet another riff on what <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>and</b> crazy guy Tracy Jordan is", the series was really finding its footing. Mitovich enjoyed the appearances of Dratch and Parnell, labeling the latter as {{the highlight of the}} episode. Robert Canning of IGN said that the episode [...] "failed to deliver the comic gold we were hoping for." [...] Canning had hoped that Tracy's storyline would be a [...] "subtle, fairly straightforward plot", in contrast to the wackiness the series had a reputation for, but found it unfunny. The reviewer did not enjoy the appearances of Dratch and Winters, and felt Conan O'Brien was not used to his full potential. Canning rated the episode 5 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|The accused witches {{lived in}} the area around Pendle Hill in Lancashire, a county which, {{at the end of the}} 16th century, was {{regarded}} by the authorities as <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>and</b> lawless region: an area [...] "fabled for its theft, violence and sexual laxity, where the church was honoured without much understanding of its doctrines by the common people". The nearby Cistercian abbey at Whalley had been dissolved by Henry VIII in 1537, a move strongly resisted by the local people, over whose lives the abbey had until then exerted a powerful influence. Despite the abbey's closure, and the execution of its abbot, the people of Pendle remained largely faithful to their Roman Catholic beliefs and were quick to revert to Catholicism on Queen Mary's accession to the throne in 1553.|$|E

500|$|Parts of {{the early}} village were in Upper Heworth, and the {{remainder}} in Gateshead Fell, <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>and</b> treacherous area of common land notable for the criminality of the tinkers and hawkers who lived there. There is some evidence of Roman occupation; a proposed enclosure map of Heworth Common from 1766 charts a Roman Causeway running between Carr Hill Lane (now Carr Hill Road) and Blue Quarries in Sheriff Hill. The likely explanation for Roman interest in the area is Swan Pond, {{twice the size of}} the pond at Saltwell Park, the fresh water from which might be used to fill bathhouses and flush latrines. Indeed, in 1697, William Yarnold obtained a lease for the laying of cisterns and pipes to bring water from [...] "the Great Pond at Carr's Hill", shown on ordnance survey maps as Swan Pond, to Newcastle upon Tyne.|$|E
500|$|The accused witches {{lived in}} Lancashire, an English county which, {{at the end}} of the 16th century, was {{regarded}} by the authorities as <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>and</b> lawless region, [...] "fabled for its theft, violence and sexual laxity, where the church was honoured without much understanding of its doctrines by the common people". Since the death of Queen Mary and the accession to the throne of her half-sister Elizabeth in 1558, Catholic priests had been forced into hiding, but in remote areas like Lancashire they continued to celebrate mass in secret. In early 1612, the year of the trials, each justice of the peace (JP) in Lancashire was ordered to compile a list of the recusants in their area– those who refused to attend the services of the Church of England, a criminal offence at that time.|$|E
500|$|In 1647, Gateshead Fell was {{surveyed}} and {{was found}} to consist of [...] of land. A number of small, isolated settlements had developed around the road at modern-day Deckham, Wrekenton, [...] Low Fell and Sheriff Hill. The few cottages and properties at Sheriff Hill were of such poor quality that in 1713, the total of ninety-one cottages returned only £89s6d in rent. The rental rate declined {{over the years and}} eventually, poverty rates were so high that several tenants paid no rent. The houses were extremely unappealing; many were essentially mud hutsearth mounds carved into dwellings and roofed with sod. The length of the road that ran through Sheriff Hill was called Sodhouse Bank. By the middle of the 18th century, the area had become <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>and</b> frightening place and when theologian John Wesley arrived in 1785, he found a [...] "pathless waste of white".|$|E
