5|$|After a 1994 {{plan was}} <b>approved</b> <b>and</b> a bond issue passed, {{additional}} elementary magnet schools were opened and district attendance plans redrawn, {{which resulted in}} the Topeka schools meeting court standards of racial balance by 1998. Unified status was eventually granted to Topeka Unified School District No. 501 on July 27, 1999. One of the new magnet schools is named after the Scott family attorneys for their role in the Brown case and civil rights.|$|E

50|$|On May 10, 2005, Riley's {{approval}} ratings were 36% <b>approving</b> <b>and</b> 52% disapproving {{of his job}} as governor. By September 20, 2005, Riley’s {{approval ratings}} had increased substantially to 58 percent <b>approving</b> <b>and</b> 38% disapproving. Analysis of this increase {{seems to indicate that}} it may be attributed to the public’s perception of Riley’s response to Hurricane Katrina. By February 14, 2006, Riley's approval ratings had slightly decreased, with 52% <b>approving</b> <b>and</b> 43% disapproving of his job as governor. By August 2006, his approval rating was at 62% with a disapproval rating of 35%.|$|R
500|$|In January 2009 {{he stood}} at 46% <b>approving</b> <b>and</b> 40% disapproving. Woolley {{asserted}} that the governor was faring relatively well in public opinion considering [...] "the enormous and growing pressure on the state budget and on the governor to protect various constituencies". [...] Come March 2009, the PublicMind Poll found that, [...] "Gov. Jon Corzine's standing with the New Jersey public is suffering along with the economy," [...] {{and as a result}} his approvals began to slip with 40% of voters <b>approving</b> <b>and</b> 43% disapproving. His approvals continued to decline in April as he contended with the budget and the financial crisis with 40% <b>approving</b> <b>and</b> 49% disapproving. [...] At the end of his term, in January 2010, Corzine’s approvals landed at their lowest point during the administration with 33% <b>approving</b> <b>and</b> 58% disapproving.|$|R

5|$|Crittenden {{remained}} in Washington {{for a few}} weeks after Congress adjourned. Having learned that John Archibald Campbell, an Alabaman serving on the Supreme Court, had decided to resign in light of his state's secession, President Lincoln proposed to appoint Crittenden to the vacant seat. Lincoln's cabinet <b>approved,</b> <b>and</b> the nomination papers were drafted, but Campbell belatedly reconsidered his resignation, {{and by the time he}} definitely determined to resign, Lincoln had changed his mind regarding Crittenden's nomination.|$|E

5|$|A novel {{vaccine for}} dengue fever has been <b>approved</b> <b>and</b> is commercially {{available}} {{in a number of}} countries. Other methods of prevention are by reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases blood transfusion may be required. About half a million people require admission to hospital a year. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen should not be used.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} was reached in 1984 between the Grand County Commission and the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) to balance the conflicting public demands to retire and preserve the aging bridge. As part of this agreement, UDOT would commission a new bridge and once finished, transfer ownership of the original bridge back to Grand County. Grand County agreed to petition to have the bridge {{be included in the}} National Register of Historic Places, assume maintenance and guarantee the bridge would be preserved. The nomination was <b>approved</b> <b>and</b> the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 12, 1984. In 1988, the replacement bridge was completed, and the title deed to the Dewey Bridge was handed over to the county in 1989. Grand County completed a restoration project in 2000.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, British {{submarines}} began reconnoitering the German patrol lines. On 23 August, several British commanders submitted {{a plan to}} attack the patrol line with the light cruisers and destroyers of the Harwich Force, commanded by Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt. These ships would be supported by submarines and Vice Admiral David Beatty's battlecruisers and associated light forces. The plan was <b>approved</b> <b>and</b> set for 28 August. The British forces began to leave port {{on the evening of}} 26 August, beginning with the submarines assigned to the operation. Most of the surface forces went to sea early on the following morning; the 7th Cruiser Squadron, which had been added to provide further support to the Harwich Force, left port later in the day.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} state, {{the constitution of}} 1816 began to be criticized. Opponents claimed the constitution had too many appointed positions, the terms established were inadequate, {{and some of the}} clauses were too easily manipulated by the political parties that did not exist when then constitution was written. The first constitution had not been put to a vote by the general public, and following the great population growth in the state, it was seen as inadequate. A constitutional convention was called in January 1851 to create a new one. The new constitution was approved by the convention on February 10, 1851, and submitted for a vote to the electorate that year. It was <b>approved</b> <b>and</b> has since been the official constitution.|$|E
5|$|By September 20, 1928, the {{extension}} of US141 northward from Green Bay along WIS57 to the Michigan state line had been <b>approved,</b> <b>and</b> the signage was readied for installation the following month. The US102 designation was decommissioned when US141 was also extended to replace M-57 from the state line, along US2 to Crystal Falls and north to Covington. US8's eastern end was rerouted along a separate bridge over the Menominee River to a new terminus at an intersection with US2 in Norway in 1929. US141 was fully paved in Wisconsin in the early 1930s; the last segment to be completed was between Pound and Abrams.|$|E
