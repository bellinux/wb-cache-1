40|$|Purpose. It is {{important}} for Ukraine to have a network of airports, which would promote the current and long-term implementation of air transportation needs {{of the population and}} the economics. This study aims to establish criteria of <b>airports</b> <b>classification</b> to determine their {{role in the development of}} the air transport system of Ukraine. Methodology. The methods of statistical analysis were used for the processing of data according to categories of airport productivity and geographic information system for data visualization. Findings. It is established that the existing division of Ukrainian airports into international and domestic, as well as into coordinated and non-coordinated ones is not relevant for determining the role of airport in the development of air transport system of the country and accordingly for the priority in financing of their modernization. The approach to the determination of <b>airports</b> <b>classifications</b> using analysis of performance categories was developed. Originality. Classification criterions of the airports in Ukraine are proposed: by type of activity and by the maintenance of scheduled route network. It is proposed to classify the airports by the type of activity to the primary commercial, commercial, cargo primary commercial, cargo commercial and general aviation. According to the scheduled route network maintenane it is proposed to classify the airports as the primary, non-primary and auxiliary hubs. An example of classification by the given criteria is submitted. Practical value. The value of the obtained results is in the possibility of using the proposed classification in the task of determining the priorities for financing the country's airports. As opposed to the practice of directed funding procedure in the framework of the state program of airports development, it is proposed to take into account the fact that the resumption of the functioning of the airport and/or its modernization should be as a response to effective demand of consumers (in this case, airlines), which will be the guarantors of investment return...|$|R

40|$|<b>Airport</b> <b>classification</b> is {{a common}} need in the air {{transport}} field due to several purposes—such as resource allocation, identification of crucial nodes, and real-time identification of substitute nodes—which also depend on the involved actors’ expectations. In this paper a fuzzy-based procedure has been proposed to cluster airports by using a fuzzy geometric point of view according {{to the concept of}} unit-hypercube. By representing each airport as a point in the given reference metric space, the geometric distance among airports—which corresponds to a measure of similarity—has in fact an intrinsic fuzzy nature due to the airport specific characteristics.

40|$|Government {{agencies}} classify airports {{for different}} purposes, including {{the allocation of}} public funding for capacity developments. In a context of hub classification, determining the contribution of each airport to the national network {{in terms of the}} two dimensions of hubbing -i. e., traffic generation and connectivity- is a key aspect. In this regard, the choice of an appropriate connectivity indicator is still an unresolved issue. This paper adapts the well-known flow centrality indicator to an air transport context and develops a novel measure of airport connectivity. An application to the US domestic network is provided, using quarterly data on passenger demand to perform a detailed time-series analysis of airport connectivity patterns between 1993 and 2012. The flow centrality indicator is then used to define an alternative <b>airport</b> <b>classification</b> method {{within the context of the}} Federal Aviation Administration’s National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIASs).

40|$|Analyzing airports' role {{in global}} air {{transportation}} and monitoring their development over time provides an additional {{perspective on the}} dynamics of network evolution. In {{order to understand the}} different roles airports can play in the network an integrated and multi-dimensional approach is needed. Therefore, an approach to <b>airport</b> <b>classification</b> through hierarchical clustering considering several parameters from network theory is presented in this paper. By applying a 29  year record of global flight data and calculating the conditional transition probabilities the results are displayed as an evolution graph similar to a discrete-time Markov chain. With this analytical concept the meaning of airports is analyzed from a network perspective and a new airport taxonomy is established. The presented methodology allows tracking the development of airports from certain categories into others over time. Results show that airports of equal classes run through similar stages of development with a limited number of alternatives, indicating clear evolutionary patterns. Apart from giving an overview of the results the paper illustrates the exact data-driven approach and suggests an evaluation scheme. The methodology can help the public and industry sector to make informed strategy decisions when it comes to air transportation infrastructure...|$|E

50|$|Only one {{incident}} {{has been reported}} to the National Transportation Safety Board since 2000: an airplane left the side of the runway, attributed to pilot error. Before 2000, three doctors were killed on a football Saturday when they crashed into the runway. Runway expansions have been proposed since the 1980s but have been denied on each occasion by city councils. The need for runway expansion on safety grounds is unclear as purported over-runs were actually {{off the side of the}} runway and attributed to pilot error after investigation. The most recent proposed runway expansion project, first floated to the Ann Arbor City Council in 2007, proposes lengthening the runway by 800 feet, and moving the entire runway toward the south west corner of the airport (closer to neighboring residential subdivisions). This would not change the <b>airport's</b> <b>classification</b> but could affect the size of the aircraft using the airport; the decision to land is made on an individual basis at the discretion of the pilot. All B-II small aircraft are currently capable of operating on the existing 3,505 ft runway without weight restriction. However, larger airplanes (jets) already do use this B-II certified runway but with weight and fuel restrictions. Any extension to the runway will not change the operation of B-II classification aircraft, but will allow larger aircraft (jets in the C-I and C-II categories) to land and operate out of the airport with full weight and fuel. The proposal is undergoing environmental impact studies, but has experienced delays because of initial inaccuracies supplied in the proposal, prolonged review by the FAA, and opposition from Pittsfield Township and the local citizens' group Committee for Preserving Community Quality, made up of citizens from Pittsfield and Lodi, as well as some Ann Arborites who view the project as too expensive or unlikely to be approved. On March 24, 2009, Pittsfield unanimously approved a Resolution Opposing Proposed Expansion of the Ann Arbor Municipal Airport Runway. Lodi Township, which is adjacent to Pittsfield on the west side and also impacted by ARB, passed a similar resolution on May 12, 2009. A legal petition has been made to the Secretary of Transportation Washington, D.C. in opposition to the proposed expansion.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, a {{methodology}} is {{proposed for the}} conceptual design and optimisation of twin-turboprop Commuter & Regional aircraft suitable for operation over a spe¬cific short-haul route. Using this methodology, the optimum configuration and flight profiles of such aircraft for operation over various stage-lengths can be obtained. By significantly modifying an existing computer code for synthesis and trajectory opti¬misation of Commuter aircraft (CASTOR), a new code (CRAGER) has been developed to estimate the Generalised cost of travel incurred by a passenger for air-travel be¬tween two cities. A new sub-module has been developed for the geometric sizing of a suitable airport as per ICAO/FAA recommendations, and estimation of the Airport cost, i. e. the cost associated with setting-up and operating this airport {{at one of the}} two cities. This module is incorporated into CRAGER. Generalised cost is assumed to consist of the Access cost, Flight cost, Time cost and the Airport cost, and is proposed as a new objective function to be minimised. In an exploratory case study, the efficacy of two stochastic optimisation methods viz. Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Simulated Annealing (SA) was demonstrated for handling complicated objective functions related to aircraft conceptual design. In particular, the SIMANN SA code was found to be quite robust and easy to imple¬ment, and came up with better solutions compared to conventional gradient based optimisers for multi-modal objective functions. As an example of the application of the proposed methodology, several case studies were carried out for business travel in India, using both CASTOR & CRAGER. Based on a survey of existing regional airports in India, the airports were classified under three levels, enabling estimation of Airport cost associated with operating a specific aircraft. A model was developed for predicting the demand for business travel in India between a metropolitan city (hub) and another city located near-by (spoke). The case studies revealed the non-linear nature of the airport sub-module, due to the <b>airport</b> <b>classification</b> system followed by ICAO & FAA. It was seen that when the annual travel demand is low, the Generalised cost is dominated by the Airport cost and the Time cost. With increase in annual travel demand, however, the Flight costs dominate the Generalised cost, hence larger aircraft have lower Generalised costs. High-capacity aircraft were seen to have a low Flight cost, but this advantage was more than overcome by the excessively high Airport and Time costs associated with them. Compared to pressurised aircraft, the un-pressurised commuter aircraft suffer from severe penalties due to limitations imposed on their cruising altitude and descent profile. Finally, the optimum 50 seater aircraft obtained by CRAGER had better or marginally lower DOC and Generalised cost compared to existing aircraft...|$|E
40|$|The western United States {{offers a}} case study on the {{importance}} of access to large population centers and their markets, via road and air travel, for economic development.

40|$|Since deregulation, {{passenger}} {{air travel}} and {{the airline industry}} as a whole have changed dramatically. While most previous research has focused on the changes experienced by the airlines, this thesis seeks to understand the effects of industry changes on passenger accessibility. This work develops a methodology to quantitatively measure accessibility changes and then applies the methodology to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics' DBIB dataset, a 10 % sample of all tickets purchased in the United States. The analysis reviews changes in accessibility based on 4 measures: a new path quality measure, passenger volume, circuity, and fares at all continental US Primary and Commercial Service airports. The results indicate that between 1980 and 2010 accessibility declined in terms of path quality and circuity, but those declines were offset by accessibility increases in terms of lower fares which resulted in increased passenger volume. While the primary analysis was aggregated by FAA <b>airport</b> size <b>classifications,</b> the methodology can also be used at a regional scale. This is demonstrated through a case study of the 3 largest airports in the Boston region which have developed symbiotically despite having overlapping catchment areas. The results yield insights that would otherwise be missed in a higher level analysis and highlight the importance of regional analysis to understanding passenger accessibility. The thesis also uses the methodology and data {{to examine the effects of}} industry changes on rural communities by looking at the Essential Air Service program, which subsidizes air service to rural communities. The analysis found that the program has performed well in terms of preserving rural air accessibility but that certain program regulations make the program financially inefficient. Several changes are proposed to improve the program's effectiveness and value to passengers. Finally, the analysis looks towards the future and the extension of this work as a foundation for thinking about how to improve passenger accessibility while dealing with the challenges facing the industry including financial instability, airport congestion, the potential for partial re-regulation, future changes in the network structure, and potential reduction in EAS funding. by James Joseph Jenkins.

40|$|The Surface Movement Guidance and Control System (SMGCS) is {{a system}} {{providing}} the surveillance, routing, guidance and control supports to the airport traffic. The moving objects being managed include all the aircraft and vehicles in the interested area on the surface; the personnel making use of this system are the pilots, vehicle drivers, and ground controllers. The airport surface traffic management has long been discussed because of the operational challenges; this includes the increasing complexity of the field movement management and the density of airport traffic. To improve airport operation qualities, the Advanced Surface Movement Control and Guidance System (A-SMGCS) was introduced. In terms of architecture and capability differences, there are two levels of the A-SMGCS, which are A-SMGCS I & II. The positive impacts on the airport surface operation are: safety, capacity, efficiency, human factor conditions, and economic issues. This project deals with an investigation on SMGCS baseline and the A-SMGCS, covering the system conception, background, current developments and relative technologies. The applications in practical operations are discussed as well. There is also an analysis about the <b>airport</b> surface incursion <b>classification</b> and severity. Based on this, a simulation is presented to illustrate the practical applications of the A-SMGCS. The simulation results show the functions of Human Machine Interface (HMI) in A-SMGCS, including the designation and diversion for clearance, the real-time view of surface target movements and the indications for contracted incursions. Over all, the research aims are to work on an investigation and explanation of A-SMGCS, and to implement a simulation of the system functions. The implementation includes the image processing, system architecture definition in Simulink, Graphical User Interface (GUI) design for the HMI, and the corresponding Matlab programming for simulation environment establishment...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} ground collision in poor weather conditions. As bad weather is an adverse factor when airplanes are taxiing, an obstacle detection system based on thermal vision is proposed to enhance the awareness of pilots during taxiing in poor weather conditions. Two infrared cameras are employed to detect the objects and estimate {{the distance of the}} obstacle. The distance is computed by stereo vision technology. A warning will be given if the distance is less than the safe distance predefined. To make the system independent, the proposed system is an on-board system which does not rely on airports or other airplanes. The type of obstacle is classified by the temperature of the object. Fuzzy logic is employed in the classification. Obstacles are classified into three main categories: aircraft, vehicle and people. Membership functions are built based on the temperature distribution of obstacles measured at the airport. In order to improve the accuracy of classification, a concept of using position information is proposed. Different types of obstacle are predefined according to different area at the <b>airport.</b> In the <b>classification,</b> obstacles are classified according to the types limited in that area. Due to the limitation of the thermal infrared camera borrowed, images were captured first and then processed offline. Experiments were carried out to evaluate the detecting distance error and the performance of system in poor weather conditions. The classification of obstacle is simulated with real thermal images and pseudo position information at the airport. The results suggest that the stereo vision system developed in this research was able to detect the obstacle and estimate the distance. The classification method classified the obstacles to a certain extent. Therefore, the proposed system can improve safety of aircraft and enhance situational awareness of pilots. The programming language of the system is Python 2. 7. Computer graphic library OpenCV 2. 3 is used in processing images. MATLAB is used in the simulation of obstacle classification...|$|R
