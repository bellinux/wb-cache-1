5|$|Chemical {{principles}} govern specific RNA {{interaction with}} <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> Experiments with aptamers showed that some <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> have a selective chemical affinity for their codons. Experiments showed that of 8 <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> tested, 6 show some RNA triplet-amino acid association.|$|E
5|$|Most {{microorganisms}} {{and plants}} can biosynthesize all 20 standard <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> while animals (including humans) must obtain {{some of the}} <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> from the diet. The <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> that an organism cannot synthesize on its own {{are referred to as}} essential <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> Key enzymes that synthesize certain <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> are not present in animals — such as aspartokinase, which catalyses {{the first step in the}} synthesis of lysine, methionine, and threonine from aspartate. If <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> are present in the environment, microorganisms can conserve energy by taking up the <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> from their surroundings and downregulating their biosynthetic pathways.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amino</b> <b>acids</b> {{that share}} the same biosynthetic pathway tend {{to have the same}} first base in their codons. This could be an {{evolutionary}} relic of an early, simpler genetic code with fewer <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> that later evolved to code a larger set of <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> It could also reflect steric and chemical properties that had another effect on the codon during its evolution. <b>Amino</b> <b>acids</b> with similar physical properties also tend to have similar codons, reducing the problems caused by point mutations and mistranslations.|$|E
50|$|Excitatory <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> {{receptor}} ligands are ligands of excitatory <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> receptors (EAARs), {{also known}} as glutamate receptors. They include excitatory <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> receptor agonists and excitatory <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> receptor antagonists.|$|R
50|$|A glutamatergic agent (or drug) is a {{chemical}} that directly modulates the excitatory <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> (glutamate/aspartate) {{system in the}} body or brain. Examples include excitatory <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> receptor agonists, excitatory <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> receptor antagonists, and excitatory <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> reuptake inhibitors.|$|R
25|$|<b>Amino</b> <b>acid</b> {{substitution}} (e.g., D111E) — The {{first letter}} {{is the one}} letter code of the wild-type <b>amino</b> <b>acid,</b> the number is {{the position of the}} <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> from the N-terminus, and the second letter is the one letter code of the <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> present in the mutation. Nonsense mutations are represented with an X for the second <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> (e.g. D111X).|$|R
5|$|In <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> {{that have}} a carbon chain {{attached}} to the α–carbon (such as lysine, shown to the right) the carbons are labeled in order as α, β, γ, δ, and so on. In some <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> the amine group {{is attached to the}} β or γ-carbon, and these are therefore referred to as beta or gamma <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b>|$|E
5|$|Organisms vary {{in their}} ability to {{synthesize}} the 20 common <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> Most bacteria and plants can synthesize all twenty, but mammals can only synthesize eleven nonessential <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> so nine essential <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> must be obtained from food. Some simple parasites, such as the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae, lack all amino acid synthesis and take their <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> directly from their hosts. All <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> are synthesized from intermediates in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, or the pentose phosphate pathway. Nitrogen is provided by glutamate and glutamine. Amino acid synthesis depends on the formation of the appropriate alpha-keto acid, which is then transaminated to form an amino acid.|$|E
5|$|The 20 <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> {{that are}} encoded {{directly}} by the codons of the universal genetic code are called standard or canonical <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> A modified form of methionine (N-formylmethionine) is often incorporated in place of methionine as the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Other <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> are called non-standard or non-canonical. Most of the non-standard <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> are also non-proteinogenic (i.e. they cannot be incorporated into proteins during translation), but {{two of them are}} proteinogenic, as they can be incorporated translationally into proteins by exploiting information not encoded in the universal genetic code.|$|E
50|$|The potato {{inhibitor}} is synthesised as a precursor, {{having a}} 29 <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> N-terminal signal peptide, a 27 <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> pro-peptide, the 39 <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> mature inhibitor region and a 7 <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> C-terminal extension. The 7 <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> C-terminal extension {{is involved in}} inhibitor inactivation and may be required for targeting to the vacuole where the mature active inhibitor accumulates.|$|R
50|$|<b>Amino</b> <b>acid</b> {{replacement}} is {{a change}} from one <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> to a different <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> due to point mutation in DNA sequence. It is caused by nonsynonymous missense mutation which alters the codon sequence to code other <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> instead of the originals.|$|R
40|$|The {{property}} of an <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> is different {{according to the}} variation of protein secondary structure. Each central <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> corresponds to a position specific <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> distribution around it. Based on the probability distribution for the central <b>amino</b> <b>acid,</b> we get <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> distance matrices and classifications for helix, sheet, coil and turn. It is observed that evident discrepancy exists in <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> distance for different protein secondary structure. Some obvious difference between the distance matrices and blocks substitution matrix(BLOSUM) is found which {{can tell the difference}} of <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> property between in certain protein secondary structure and the whole protein database. The classification of <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> alphabets for specific protein secondary structure provide a clue for observing these difference...|$|R
5|$|The {{first few}} <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> were {{discovered}} in the early 19th century. In 1806, French chemists Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin and Pierre Jean Robiquet isolated a compound in asparagus that was subsequently named asparagine, the first amino acid to be discovered. Cystine was discovered in 1810, although its monomer, cysteine, remained undiscovered until 1884. Glycine and leucine {{were discovered in}} 1820. The last of the 20 common <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> to be discovered was threonine in 1935 by William Cumming Rose, who also determined the essential <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> and established the minimum daily requirements of all <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> for optimal growth.|$|E

5|$|A {{comparative}} study of the amino acid composition of eleven Portuguese wild edible mushroom species showed Boletus edulis to have the highest total amino acid content, about 2.3g per 100g of dried mushroom. This total includes {{a full complement of}} 20 essential and nonessential <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> Analysis of the free <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> (that is, those not bound up in protein) revealed glutamine and alanine to be the principal <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> (each about 25% of total compounds); a separate analysis concluded that lysine is another predominant compound.|$|E
40|$|Bovine {{thyrocalcitonin}} {{has been}} isolated in homogeneous form, and its complete <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> sequence determined. The bovine hormone is a singlechain 32 <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> polypeptide. It contains a 1 - 7 amino terminal disulfide bridge, and the carboxyl terminal <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> is prolinamide.

40|$|<b>Amino</b> <b>acid</b> {{transport}} in <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> auxotrophs of Thiobacillus thioparus was enhanced during {{growth on}} rate-limiting <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> concentration. A pleiotropic mutation enhanced general <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> transport as manifested by higher values of Vmax of <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> transport. Affinity constants remained unaltered. Mutants with enhanced transport properties {{did not show}} changes in oxidation of thiosulfate, did not oxidize various organic compounds, and did not increase the heterotrophic potential of T. thioparus. The mutations for enhanced transport caused increased synthesis of <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> transport system components. A method for genetic transformation of T. thioparus is described...|$|R
50|$|C21orf62 has a myristoylation {{site from}} <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> 26-31. It has a sumoylation site from <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> 132-135. Additionally, {{it has a}} nuclear export signal from <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> 98-104.|$|R
5|$|<b>Amino</b> <b>acids</b> are the {{structural}} units (monomers) {{that make up}} proteins. They join together to form short polymer chains called peptides or longer chains called either polypeptides or proteins. These polymers are linear and unbranched, with each amino acid within the chain attached to two neighboring <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> The process of making proteins encoded by DNA/RNA genetic material is called translation and involves the step-by-step addition of <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> to a growing protein chain by a ribozyme that is called a ribosome. The order in which the <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> are added is read through the genetic code from an mRNA template, which is a RNA copy {{of one of the}} organism's genes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amino</b> <b>acids</b> {{are usually}} {{classified}} by {{the properties of}} their side chain into four groups. The side chain can make an amino acid a weak acid or a weak base, and a hydrophile if the side chain is polar or a hydrophobe if it is nonpolar. The chemical structures of the 22 standard <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> along with their chemical properties, are described more fully in the article on these proteinogenic <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} 22 proteinogenic <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> many non-proteinogenic <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> are known. Those either are {{not found in}} {{proteins}} (for example carnitine, GABA, Levothyroxine) or are not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery (for example, hydroxyproline and selenomethionine).|$|E
40|$|<b>Amino</b> <b>acid</b> {{absorption}} from a peptide-containing {{protein hydrolysate}} and an equivalent <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> mixture over {{a range of}} concentrations of the two [...] such as {{is thought to be}} found in the normal intestine after a meal [...] has been studied using a jejunal perfusion technique in man. The relative rates of <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> absorption from the protein hydrolysate and <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> mixture varied markedly with concentration, demonstrating that the global hypothesis that peptides confer an advantage in <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> absorption in vivo is too simple. There is a highly significant correlation between <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> absorption and the concentrations of <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> in the perfusate, whether this contained <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> or protein hydrolysate, suggesting that, under these experimental conditions at least, the presence of distinct <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> and peptide transport systems is relatively unimportant. Doubt is thus cast upon suggestions derived from previous intestinal perfusion experiments that intact peptide transport may be nutritionally significant in man...|$|R

5|$|IUPAC {{also has}} a system for giving codes to {{identify}} <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> and nucleotide bases. IUPAC needed a coding system that represented long sequences of <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> This would allow for these sequences to be compared {{to try to find}} homologies. These codes can consist of either a one letter code or a three letter code.|$|E
5|$|In animals, <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> are {{obtained}} through {{the consumption of}} foods containing protein. Ingested proteins are then broken down into <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> through digestion, which typically involves denaturation of the protein through exposure to acid and hydrolysis by enzymes called proteases. Some ingested <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> are used for protein biosynthesis, while others are converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis, or fed into the citric acid cycle. This use of protein as a fuel is particularly important under starvation conditions as it allows the body's own proteins {{to be used to}} support life, particularly those found in muscle.|$|E

5|$|In humans, {{at least}} three {{transcript}} variants are known for EFS: isoform 1, containing 6 exons end encoding the full-length protein with 561 amino acids; isoform 2, containing 5 exons and encoding a shorter protein (468 <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> in length); and isoform 3, containing 6 exons and encoding the shortest protein (392 <b>amino</b> <b>acids).</b>|$|E
5|$|In transcription, the codons {{of a gene}} are copied into {{messenger}} RNA by RNA polymerase. This RNA copy is then decoded by a ribosome {{that reads}} the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to transfer RNA, which carries <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (43combinations). These encode the twenty standard <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> giving most <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> more than one possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying {{the end of the}} coding region; these are the TAA, TGA, and TAG codons.|$|E
5|$|Nonstandard <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> {{are usually}} formed through {{modifications}} to standard <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> For example, homocysteine is formed through the transsulfuration pathway {{or by the}} demethylation of methionine via the intermediate metabolite S-adenosyl methionine, while hydroxyproline is made by a posttranslational modification of proline.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{of similar}} design {{were conducted with}} male broiler chickens over two body weight ranges, 200 to 800 g in Experiment 1 and 800 to 1, 600 g in Experiment 2. The data were {{used to test the}} hypothesis that protein deposition rate increases (linearly) with increasing <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> intake, until energy intake becomes limiting for protein deposition rate. Additional <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> intake above this point would be deposited less efficiently. An increase in energy intake would increase lipid deposition rate, but should, at low <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> intakes, not affect protein deposition rate. Each experiment consisted of 18 treatments: two levels of protein-free energy (energy(pf)) intake, combined with nine <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> to energypf ratios. Protein was balanced for <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> content and lysine was the first limiting <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> in the diet. Protein deposition rate increased with additional <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> intake. No evidence was found that energy(pf) intake limited protein deposition rate at high <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> intake. Extra intake of energy(pf) increased lipid deposition rate, which was independent of <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> intake. Where <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> intake was limiting, additional intake of energy(pf) had generally no effect on protein deposition rate. The marginal efficiency of <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> utilization for protein deposition did not depend on body weight. The facts are relevant to the modeling of the growth of broiler chickens...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} sorbate on L-serine and L-histidine uptake in Salmonella typhimurium was studied at various pH levels, temperatures, and <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> and sorbate concentrations.
