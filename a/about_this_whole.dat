500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times also was {{impressed}} with the cast's singing abilities, and praised the writers' risk-taking: [...] "that just goes to show how well thought out, creative, and just plain fun tonight’s “Fringe” really was. A lot of people would have pegged a 1940s film noir musical episode as a big risk, but the bigger the risk, the bigger the pay out". Rhee Dee of Pinkraygun.com commented [...] "After the revelation in the last episode, and Peter running away, this episode was a great way to express Walter’s grief and guilt <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> situation without actually watching Walter talk about how sad and guilty he feels about everything. Walter’s story serves as a powerful metaphor for how he actually feels". Tim Grierson of New York Magazine thought the episode turned out to be simply mediocre because [...] "its noir elements weren’t incorporated in a really interesting way, and as for the musical numbers, they tended to be throwaway bits, save for “fictional” Dunham crooning “For Once in My Life” to the seemingly dying “fictional” Peter near the episode’s end". Grierson continued that [...] "If a show is going to completely throw away its usual rulebook for a fun onetime-only episode, {{it would be great if}} the writers could come up with a story as audacious as their premise. But aside from some Chinatown references, fancy threads, and mildly clever mirroring of the show’s mythology — Massive Dynamic is up to no good in this story-land world as well — 'Brown Betty' wasn’t all that enjoyable because it didn’t do a great job of capturing what generally makes Fringe enjoyable".|$|E
2500|$|Hughes {{was accused}} of being a Communist by many on the {{political}} right, but he always denied it. When asked why he never joined the Communist Party, he wrote, [...] "it was based on strict discipline and the acceptance of directives that I, as a writer, did not wish to accept." [...] In 1953, he was called before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations led by Senator Joseph McCarthy. He stated, [...] "I never read the theoretical books of socialism or communism or the Democratic or Republican parties for that matter, and so my interest in whatever may be considered political has been non-theoretical, non-sectarian, and largely emotional and born out of my own need to find some way of thinking <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> problem of myself." [...] Following his testimony, Hughes distanced himself from Communism. He was rebuked by some on the Radical Left who had previously supported him. He moved away from overtly political poems and towards more lyric subjects. When selecting his poetry for his Selected Poems (1959) he excluded all his radical socialist verse from the 1930s.|$|E

However, Barthelme 2 ̆ 7 s nebulous status somewhere within the realm of 2 ̆ 2 postmodern 2 ̆ 2 fiction, itself an extremely opaque and undefinable term, leads me to wonder how to go <b>about</b> tackling <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> enterprise. Can Barthelme 2 ̆ 7 s fiction be understood if it is divorced from the larger body·of postmodern fiction, if a description of the general cha acteristics of postmodern fiction is ignored? For that matter, can postmodern fiction, with its basic antimimetic presuppositions, really be adequately xamined without delving into the past to modernist fiction and investigating how postmodern fiction is both a rejection and a continuation of various conventions and assumptions of modernist fiction...|$|R

For a year of teaching input we had encountered a variety of issues but the common theme to all was change. All of us had personal experience of change and were becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of guidance on implementation and making change stick. We wanted to unlock the secrets to successful change within organisations. Many a book has been written <b>about</b> <b>this</b> and <b>whole</b> industries have grown up to support it. And yet we are still faced with the harsh reality that most change initiatives are not successful, in fact, much literature quotes 70 % as the failure rate. So as manufacturing managers, as change leaders do we accept that this is an unalterable fact of business life? I...|$|R

5000|$|J.L.H. {{asked for}} {{support from the}} {{municipal}} coffers. The council’s opinion was as follows: “Applicant is a sturdy man of 37 years, who from youth onwards adapted himself to begging. He calls himself a day labourer, but will work for nobody and busies himself merely with gathering horse dung in the streets, where he can be an idler. He could have work the year round in fieldwork and in winter in threshing. This year he was offered work in caring for geese, for which he could have earned from May to November 40 guilders and for each goose a pound of bread, but which he also did not take on. His wife, 36 years old, strong and healthy, is just as shy of work; even in the harvest these two highly lazy people take on no harvesting work. <b>About</b> <b>this,</b> the <b>whole</b> municipality is angered and gives nothing further. The policeman has the duty of disrupting begging. Were it further allowed the couple, {{they would have been}} able to live continually without fending for food. Such people are unworthy of being supported.” ...|$|R
5000|$|In the film, the {{character}} Nic finally listens and hears [...] "The Signal" [...] {{and in a}} fiery burst Nic discovers his true feelings: love. Having found his true emotions, Nic chooses to follow {{a course of action}} based on love. Eubank discusses this claim saying the critical part of the film is [...] "to watch Nic arc out, to decide 'You know what, I’ve been trying to think logically <b>about</b> <b>this</b> the <b>whole</b> time... and have always been trying to run away from my emotions, here’s a situation that says logically I shouldn’t do this or I’m at great risk if I do this, so logically I should do nothing.' And he decides to do something, and to go for it, and he embraces it." [...] This decision {{flies in the face of}} logic but trusting love empowers him and this transformation enables him to break out of the allegorical cave of darkness he had formerly found himself in and out into the wide field of reality.|$|R

That is the discouraging thing <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> business; you can't convince any one by {{any amount of}} evidence. A man will stand out against Zöllner, Crookes, Lodge, and Myers, discounting {{all the rest of}} the great investigators, and then crumple up like a caterpillar at the first touch of The Invisible Hand when it comes to him directly. This same young man gave me the most convincing demonstrations of materialized forms I have ever seen. In his own little home, under the simplest conditions, he commanded forth from a little bedroom a figure which was unmistakably not a mechanism. A lamp was burning in the room, and the young fellow was perfectly visible at the same moment as the phantom which stood and bowed three times." ...|$|E

6000|$|Lord Lufton, whose anger {{during the}} whole {{interview}} had been extreme, and who had become more angry the more he talked, had now walked once or twice {{up and down the}} room; and as he so walked the idea did occur to him that he had been unjust. He had come there with the intention of exclaiming against Sowerby, and of inducing Robarts to convey to that gentleman, that if he, Lord Lufton, were made to undergo any further annoyance <b>about</b> <b>this</b> bill, the <b>whole</b> affair should be thrown into the lawyer's hands; but instead of doing this, he had brought an accusation against Robarts. That Robarts had latterly become Sowerby's friend rather than his own in all these horrid money dealings, had galled him; and now he had expressed himself in terms much stronger than he had intended to use. [...] "As to you personally, Mark," [...] he said, coming back to the spot on which Robarts was standing, [...] "I do not wish to say anything that shall annoy you." ...|$|R
