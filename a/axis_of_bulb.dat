40|$|The {{suitability}} of image analysis was studied to measure bulb characteristics for varietal testing of onions (Allium cepa L.). Eighteen genotypes were used, which covered {{a whole range}} of onion shapes, including some quite identical ones. The characteristic height and diameter were measured both by image analysis and by hand. The methods gave comparable results with regard to precision and discriminating power. The discriminating power of the image analysis method could be increased by adding a new characteristic: the relative position of the diameter. For determining the height <b>of</b> the <b>bulb</b> with image analysis two methods are described to locate the top <b>of</b> a <b>bulb.</b> One method is to use the location of the inflection point as the top <b>of</b> the <b>bulb.</b> For most bulb shapes, this point coincides with the top <b>of</b> the <b>bulb</b> as indicated by a crop expert. For ovate shaped onions, however, the inflection point is below the top <b>of</b> the <b>bulb</b> as indicated by the crop expert. The other method is to use the location of the intercept of the tangent at the inflection point with the length <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bulb</b> as the top <b>of</b> the <b>bulb.</b> This point is always above the top as indicated by the crop expert. Moreover it seems to perform slightly worse for the discrimination of cultivars. Therefore the location of the inflection point as the top <b>of</b> the <b>bulb</b> is preferred...|$|R
40|$|The brain {{neuronal}} {{network is}} complex. This elaborated wiring relies on an extensive number of guidance cues and receptors. Based on studies from several neuronal systems, numerous molecules have been characterized in the navigation of neurites. Here, we studied the wiring of mouse olfactory sensory neurons towards an anterior brain structure, the olfactory bulb. Each olfactory sensory neuron population usually forms one glomerulus on the lateral side {{and one on}} the medial side <b>of</b> each <b>bulb</b> in a symmetric fashion, creating thus intra-bulb mirror images. Recent studies suggested a role for Neuropilin 1 and Semaphorin 3 a in axonal targeting along the antero-posterior <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the olfactory <b>bulbs.</b> We studied the role played by these molecules in the glomerular map formation. We used genetically controlled removal of either Neuropilin 1 or Semaphorin 3 a to assess this role...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIn {{the mouse}} {{olfactory}} system, the anatomical locations of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) roughly correlate with their axonal projection sites along the dorsal-ventral (D-V) <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the olfactory <b>bulb</b> (OB). Here {{we report that}} an axon guidance receptor, Neuropilin- 2 (Nrp 2), and its repulsive ligand, Semaphorin- 3 F (Sema 3 F), are expressed by OSNs in a complementary manner that is important for establishing olfactory map topography. Sema 3 F is secreted by early-arriving axons of OSNs and is deposited at the anterodorsal OB to repel Nrp 2 -positive axons that arrive later. Sequential arrival of OSN axons {{as well as the}} graded and complementary expression of Nrp 2 and Sema 3 F by OSNs help to form the topographic order along the D-V axis...|$|R
40|$|Each primary {{olfactory}} neuron in {{the mouse}} expresses a single type of odorant receptor. All neurons expressing the same odorant receptor gene typically project to two topographically fixed glomeruli, one each on the medial and lateral surfaces <b>of</b> the olfactory <b>bulb.</b> While topographic gradients of guidance receptors and their ligands help {{to establish the}} retinotectal projection, similar orthogonal distributions of cues {{have not yet been}} detected within the olfactory system. While odorant receptors are crucial for the final targeting of axons to glomeruli, it is unclear whether the olfactory bulb itself provides instructive cues for the establishment of the topographic map. To begin to understand the role <b>of</b> the olfactory <b>bulb</b> {{in the formation of the}} olfactory nerve pathway, we developed a model whereby the gross shape <b>of</b> the <b>bulb</b> in the P 2 -IRES-tau-LacZ line of mice was radically altered during postnatal development. We have shown here that the topography of axons expressing the P 2 odorant receptor is dependent on the shape <b>of</b> the olfactory <b>bulb.</b> When the dorsoventral <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the olfactory <b>bulb</b> was compressed during the early postnatal period, newly developing P 2 axons projected to multiple inappropriate glomeruli surrounding their normal target site. These results suggest that the distribution of local guidance cues within the olfactory bulb is influenced by the shape <b>of</b> the olfactory <b>bulb</b> and that these cues contribute to the topographic positioning of glomeruli.

50|$|During activation, whilst {{the bulb}} {{is still on}} the pump, an R.F. {{induction}} heating coil connected to a powerful R.F. oscillator operating in the 27 MHz or 40.68 MHz ISM band is positioned around the bulb in the plane of the ring. The coil acts as the primary of a transformer and the ring as a single shorted turn. Large R. F. currents flow in the ring, heating it. The coil is moved along the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bulb</b> so as not to overheat and melt the ring. Once the ring is heated the barium azide decomposes into barium vapor and nitrogen. The nitrogen is pumped out and the barium condenses on the bulb above the plane of the ring forming a mirror like deposit with a large surface area. The powdered glass in the ring melts and entraps any particles which could otherwise escape loose inside the bulb causing later problems. The barium combines with any free gas when activated and continues to act after the bulb is sealed off from the pump. During use, the internal electrodes {{and other parts of the}} tube get hot. This can cause adsorbed gases to be released from metallic parts, such as anodes (plates), grids or non metallic—but porous—parts, such as sintered ceramic parts. The gas is trapped on the large area of reactive barium on the bulb wall and removed from the tube.|$|R
40|$|The {{atypical}} glomeruli {{constitute a}} particular subset of olfactory glomeruli in the rat olfactory bulb which is mainly {{characterized by a}} strong centrifugal cholinergic innervation. In the present study, the topographical organization of the mucoso-bulbar projection of these glomeruli was analysed using small injections of WGA-HRP into the anterior nasal cavity of adult rats. The atypical olfactory glomeruli were visualized on adjacent bulbar sections using acetylcholinesterase histochemistry. A mean of 29 atypical glomeruli per bulb was observed in several areas of the posterior half <b>of</b> the olfactory <b>bulb.</b> Following the rostro-caudal <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the olfactory <b>bulb,</b> the first atypical glomeruli were located in lateral positions, then in dorsal and ventral ones. The most posterior atypical glomeruli were located in the bulbar medial side. Concerning the projections from the periphery to the atypical glomeruli, various WGA-HRP patterns of labelling were observed. When the surface area of injection sites in the anterior part of the olfactory sheet was between 30 and 40 mm 2, half of the atypical population was labelled with the atypical glomeruli being heavily labelled. All sites of distribution previously described were represented. When the surface area of injection sites was inferior to 20 mm 2, only some positions distributed along the bulbar antero-posterior axis were represented. These atypical glomeruli were generally partially labelled. Taken together, these results suggest that, although atypical glomeruli are restricted in the posterior olfactory bulb, they receive peripheral projections diffusely organized along the antero-posterior <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the olfactory mucosa. This profile was {{compared with that of}} other classical olfactory glomeruli. Chem. Senses 21 : 303 - 312, 1996...|$|R

40|$|To {{explain the}} multi-wavelength light curves (from radio to X-ray) of HST- 1 in the M 87 jet, we propose an {{hourglass}} model {{that is a}} modified two-zone system of Tavecchio & Ghisellini (hereafter TG 08) : a slow hourglass-shaped or Laval nozzle-shaped layer connected by two revolving exponential surfaces surrounding a fast spine, through which plasma blobs flow. Based on the conservation of magnetic flux, the magnetic field changes along the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the hourglass. We adopt the result of TG 08 [...] -the high-energy emission from GeV to TeV can be produced through inverse Compton by the two-zone system, and the photons from radio to X-ray are mainly radiated by the fast inner zone system. Here, we only discuss the light curves of the fast inner blob from radio to X-ray. When a compressible blob travels down the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the first <b>bulb</b> in the hourglass, because of magnetic flux conservation, its cross section experiences an adiabatic compression process, which results in particle acceleration and the brightening of HST- 1. When the blob moves into the second <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> the hourglass, because of magnetic flux conservation, the dimming of the knot occurs along with an adiabatic expansion of its cross section. A similar broken exponential function could fit the TeV peaks in M 87, which may imply a correlation between the TeV flares of M 87 and the light curves from radio to X-ray in HST- 1. The Very Large Array (VLA) 22 GHz radio light curve of HST- 1 verifies our prediction based on the model fit to the main peak of the VLA 15 GHz radio light curve.

40|$|The plant {{quarantine}} measures for tulip and lily bulbs were abolished in 1988. A {{removal of the}} quarantine made Japanese bulb growers face international competition in the markets. Since then the imports <b>of</b> <b>bulbs,</b> mainly from Holland, increased rapidly and bulb prices tended to decline gradually, while the Japanese production <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> did not decrease. The imports also introduced new varieties <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> to Japan. The demand for tulip bulbs increased greatly until the late 1990 s, but in the 2000 s the Japanese bulb markets stagnated. Bulb prices decreased, and the domestic production <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> decreased sharply, which caused a great {{reduction in the number}} <b>of</b> <b>bulb</b> farmers. Consequently, the rate of self-sufficiency for producing tulip bulbs in Japan decreased from 80 % in 1988 to 20 % in 2006, even though the volume <b>of</b> imported <b>bulbs</b> decreased in the 2000 s. This paper analyzes the demand and supply conditions <b>of</b> tulip <b>bulbs,</b> and reports estimates of the Japanese demand and supply functions <b>of</b> tulip <b>bulbs</b> by regression analysis.

40|$|ABSTRACT Although its {{importance}} as vegetable, {{a considerable amount}} <b>of</b> onion <b>bulbs</b> is lost in storage. That's why storage condition {{is one of the}} most important issues to maintain post-harvest quality. For this purpose, a factorial experiment based on randomized complete block design with two factors and three replicates was carried out. The factors were storage conditions <b>of</b> onion <b>bulbs</b> with five levels (4 oC in the seed storage apparatus, 25 and 30 oC without using rosemary leaves and branches in the incubator, and 25 and 30 oC using rosemary leaves and branches in the incubator) and storage times with ten levels (10 consecutive weeks). The storage feedbacks <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> in terms <b>of</b> the weight loss (WL) and the average bud length (ABL) <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> were analyzed. The storage <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> at 25 oC using rosemary fresh leaves and branches inside each bag <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> after 10 weeks resulted in the lowest weight loss and average bud length, and significantly controlled the post-harvest fungal rotting and improved the shelf life <b>of</b> <b>bulbs.</b> The findings <b>of</b> this study indicated the high potential of rosemary fresh leaves and branches, which can be considered as an alternative strategy to control post-harvest fungal rotting and to improve the storage life <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> considering its simplicity and efficacy in decreasing the storage cost, the weight loss and sprouting without causing any environmental toxicity...|$|R

40|$|The aim of my diploma thesis was to {{evaluate}} four densities of growth by chosen varieties of potatoes. The thesis {{deals with the}} experiment on 4 different varieties of potatoes. I have chosen the standard technology of growing ware potatoes. The selected densities of growth were 35 000, 40 000, 45 000 and 50 000 young plants ha- 1. Each variant was repeated four times. I have evaluated the yield <b>of</b> <b>bulbs,</b> the share and yield <b>of</b> ware <b>bulbs,</b> the average number <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> for one plant, the weight <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> for one plant, the average weight <b>of</b> a <b>bulb</b> and the average weight <b>of</b> ware <b>bulbs.</b> The research was done on a private farm like the field experiment. The farm is located in potato-growing area in Vysočina Region, 490 metres above the sea level. Potatoes are grown approximately over 7 hectares on the farm. The experiment started in 2010. The potato planter MARS 42 {{was used for the}} planting. The distance between drills was 0, 75 metre. Parcels consisted of 4 drills, each drill equals one repetition, each parcel equals one density of growth. On purchase of samples was realized the kickoff of 10 plants from each repetition. What followed was division <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> according to their size in each sample. They were divided into bulbs smaller than 40 millimetres and bigger. After that the samples were weighed and bulbs were counted. The number <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> and the weight <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> are very important for subtotal. It was established the variety Mirage made the best results when the density was 45 000 plants ha- 1. The variety Agria had two suitable densities of growth, namely 40 000 and 45 000 plants ha- 1. There was no considerable difference between them. In contrast with previous, the varieties Victoria and Marabel made the best result when the density was 35 000 plants ha- 1. I have realized the density 50 000 plants ha- 1 is explicitly unsuitable for all varieties. This density of growth is loss-making especially because of lowering of all assessed indexes. Another disadvantage is higher costs (more bulbs are required) and then there is also bigger risk of diseases and pests...|$|R
