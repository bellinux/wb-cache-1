5|$|I {{examined}} Mr. Andrew Wilson on Feb. 15 & 16, 1982. He {{had multiple}} bruises, swellings and abrasions {{on his face}} and head. His right eye was battered and had a superficial laceration. Andrew Wilson had several linear blisters on his right thigh, right cheek and anterior chest which were consistent with radiator burns. He stated he'd been cuffed to a radiator and pushed into it. He also stated that electrical shocks had been administered to his gums, lips and genitals. All these injuries occurred prior to his arrival <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jail.</b> There must be a thorough investigation of this alleged brutality.|$|E
5|$|Laura and L. D. {{were due}} to be arraigned on May 25. Between 11:30 and midnight on May 24, a group of between a dozen and 40 men arrived <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>jail.</b> They entered it {{through the front door}} of the sheriff's office. Payne, the jailer, said he had left it {{unlocked}} to let in a detective from McAlester, who was looking for an escaped prisoner. He said the men bound, gagged and blindfolded him at gunpoint, took his keys, and cut the telephone line. He was unable to identify them.|$|E
5|$|At Villa Imperial, one of {{the richest}} cities of Upper Peru, an open cabildo called on Goyeneche to {{withdraw}} from their territory. He obeyed, as {{he did not have the}} military strength to prevail. The Bishop of La Paz, Remigio La Santa y Ortega, fled with him. Castelli was received in Potosí and requesting that the locals swear allegiance to the Junta. He also requested that the royalist generals Francisco de Paula Sanz and José de Córdoba y Rojas submit to him. He made arrangements that the operation to capture Vicente Nieto should be carried out exclusively by the surviving members of the Regiment of Patricians from the mines of Potosi, who had been incorporated with honors into the Army of the North. Sanz, Nieto, and Córdoba were executed at the Plaza of Potosí. Nieto claimed that he died happy, because it was under the Spanish flag. Goyeneche and Ortega, on the other hand, were safe on royalist land. Bernardo Monteagudo, inmate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jail</b> of the Court of Chuquisaca for his participation in the revolution of 1809, escaped to join the ranks of the army. Castelli, who already knew Monteagudo's background, appointed him his secretary.|$|E

25|$|During {{his stay}} in Kea, Papadopoulos seemed {{confident}} {{that he and the}} members of his junta would be granted amnesty and they would eventually run for office and get elected. However, following a three-month stay on the island, in February 1975, Papadopoulos and the other four junta principals were transported by a torpedo boat to the port of Piraeus on their way to Korydallos prison.

His father and a friend (a Tulsa police detective) were rabbit hunting while off-duty around 9pm when {{approached}} by four armed men who attempted to rob them.

25|$|Roof waived his {{extradition}} {{rights and}} was flown to Sheriff Al Cannon Detention Center in North Charleston {{on the evening}} of June 18. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>jail,</b> his cell-block neighbor was Michael Slager, the former North Charleston police officer charged with murder after he shot Walter Scott. According to unconfirmed reports, Roof confessed to committing the attack and said his purpose was to start a race war.

25|$|That night Osborne again {{mounted the}} rostrum, {{and spoke to}} an {{audience}} of 200 for about 20 minutes before a policeman again approached him and told him to quit. Osborne refused and was immediately arrested. His party comrades arrived immediately with money for bail, but regular bail <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>jail</b> was refused by orders of the Chief and Osborne was held overnight in the Seattle city jail — a decision which further provoked the Socialists and led to banner headlines in the Seattle Socialist detailing the affair. A protest meeting was scheduled for Sunday night by the party, who saw a fight against the new public speaking rules on Pike Street as a matter of fundamental principle.|$|E

25|$|Rolando Espinosa, then {{mayor of}} Albuera, Leyte, died on November 5, 2016, at the Baybay City Provincial Jail. He was {{detained}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>jail</b> {{due to his}} arrest for illegal drug possession in October 2016. According to the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), Espinosa was killed during a shootout that he initiated when the CIDG came to the jail to serve him a search warrant. Espinosa's death occurred amid allegations {{that he was involved}} in the drug trade by President Rodrigo Duterte, who initiated the Philippine Drug War intending to kill criminals using or distributing drugs. The Commission on Human Rights and Karapatan have held Duterte accountable for Espinosa's death, with Senate condemning the death as an instance of extrajudicial killing.|$|E
25|$|Act Two {{begins with}} fitness queen, Brooke Wyndham, and her fitness team's workout video, {{which is being}} viewed by Elle, Callahan, Emmett, Vivienne, Warner, and Enid ("Whipped Into Shape"). Callahan tells the legal team that Brooke is accused of murdering her billionaire husband. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>jail,</b> the legal team are unable to get Brooke to tell them her alibi and refuses to plead guilty. Upon {{learning}} that they were both Delta Nu sisters, Brooke then privately tells Elle her alibi that she was getting liposuction, but makes Elle promise not to tell anyone ("Delta Nu Nu Nu"). Because of Elle's loyalty to her client and refusal to state the alibi, Elle and Emmett are shunned by the group. To cheer Emmett up and to increase his chances of impressing Callahan, Elle gives him a makeover ("Take It Like A Man").|$|E
25|$|On 5 March, about 7000-8000 people {{broke into}} the Dimapur Central Jail. They dragged the accused out, while parading him naked, pelted him with stones and beat him. They dragged the accused to a clock tower about 7km away, by tying a rope to his waist from a motorcycle. The accused died on the way. The body was {{displayed}} from the clock tower's railings, until the police came and took it down. The Superintendent of Police Meren Jamir later said that the mob was led {{by a group of}} a few hundred school and college girls in uniforms, which prevented the police from using more force. Jamir said that the initial crowd was small and they had been repelled by baton charges. But, later the mob returned with larger numbers. Even though 8 companies of security forces were present <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>jail,</b> they failed to stop the mob. The police later said that there was at least one former inmate of the prison, who knew the interior layout of the jail.|$|E

25|$|On March 7, 2016, Vann {{was charged}} with murder {{in the deaths of}} five {{additional}} victims. The death penalty is being sought for each. The following day, Vann {{was charged with}} rape and attempted murder for an alleged February 2014 attack. Vann was also charged with battery by bodily waste for allegedly throwing a carton of urine and feces at a Lake County correctional officer <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>jail</b> on February 24, 2016. In April 2016, Judge Samuel Cappas denied a motion by Vann's attorneys to sever the murder cases of Anith Jones and Afrikka Hardy, and, as a result, the capital murder trial in said cases will continue as one. In a motion filed August 5, 2016, Vann's attorneys argued that Indiana's death penalty law is unconstitutional. In November 2016, Judge Samuel Cappas denied Vann's motion to declare the state's death penalty statute unconstitutional. In January 2017, a Lake County judge decided that Vann could make an appeal with his claims that Indiana's death penalty statute is unconstitutional. In April 2017, the Indiana Supreme Court turned down Vann's request to look at the constitutionality of the state's death penalty statute before he goes to trial. At a status hearing in April 2017, Judge Samuel Cappas set jury selection to begin the week of February 12, 2018, with the actual jury trial beginning around March 12, 2018. In October 2017, Lake Superior Court Judge Samuel Cappas delayed the trial date, with jury selection being scheduled to begin September 17, 2018, and the trial beginning October 22, 2018.|$|E

Khalid Sheikh, the prison superintendent, said that while he wanted her to be treated [...] "like any other prisoner", she had to be kept away from other inmates for her own well-being, as other individuals accused of blasphemy had been killed while in prison. Out of concern that she could be poisoned, prison officials began giving Noreen raw materials to cook her own food. The Masihi Foundation, a human rights group, described her physical condition as [...] "very frail", and her health was reported to be in decline due to poor living conditions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>jail.</b> She has also been threatened by other inmates and subjected to physical abuse from prison guards.|$|E
