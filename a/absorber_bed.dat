In a few instances, a buildup of ammonium bisulfate within the activated carbon <b>bed</b> <b>absorbers</b> has become an issue. The carbon <b>bed</b> <b>absorbers</b> are used {{for the removal of}} mercury from the incinerator flue gas. Buildup of this compound on the carbon surface results in increases in the pressure drop across the adsorber, as well as decreases in the efficiency of the unit. This eventually leads to the need to shutdown the afflicted train in order to clean the absorbers and replace the activated carbon. Based upon literature research, it is believed that sulfuric acid aerosols in the system reacts with ammonia entering the gas stream from the scrubber service water to form ammonium bisulfate. In order to reduce the production of ammonium bisulfate aerosols within the gas stream, a caustic scrubbing system will be added to the system to neutralize acidic sulfur oxide species present in the waste gas. Process information provided by Infilco was used to develop a process simulation through AspenTech. Using this simulation, recommendations for the rate of sodium hydroxide addition in the gas scrubber were made. Furthermore, the change in aerosol formation due to the reduction in sulfuric acid was estimated. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Two {{models of}} {{absorber}} {{have been developed}} which describe the absorption of H 2 S and CO 2 from natural gases by aqueous di-isopropanolamine (DIPA) or methyl-di-ethanolamine (MDEA) solutions. In these models mass transfer, reaction and equilibrium processes as they prevail in conventional tray absorbers and in cascades of trickle bed reactors are incorporated. Owing to the better mass transfer characteristics of the latter type of absorber, i. e. the larger ratio between the gas phase and liquid phase mass transfer coefficients, kg/kℓ, higher selectivities for the absorption of H 2 S from sour natural gases are realized. The influence of variation {{of a number of}} operation and design parameters on tray absorber performance, H 2 S selectivity and solvent flowrate is demonstrated.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{experimental}} method {{for determining the}} kinetics of fast precipitation reactions is introduced. Use is made of a laminar jet reactor, which is also frequently applied to determine the kinetics of homogeneous gas-liquid reactions. The liquid containing {{one or more of}} the precipitating reactants passes a gas-filled reactor as a stagnant jet in which no mixing occurs. The remaining reactant needed for precipitation is supplied in gaseous form and causes the precipitation reaction to occur while it is diffusing into the jet. Hydrodynamics as well as transport phenomena are precisely known for this system, whereas agglomeration can be minimized by adjustment of the concentration of the solute supplied by the gas. The kinetics of the different crystallization steps can be determined by analyzing the size distribution of the produced particles. This new method is experimentally demonstrated for the precipitation of CuS using H 2 S gas. The obtained data were successfully used to simulate a packed <b>bed</b> <b>absorber</b> in which H 2 S is absorbed by a CuSO 4 solution. ...|$|R

The RPB had an inner diameter of 7. 6  cm, an outer diameter of 16  cm, and {{a height of}} 2  cm. The CO 2 capture efficiency was found to increase with increasing temperature {{in a range of}} 303 to 333  K. It was also found to be dependent on rotating speed, gas flow rate, and liquid flow rate. The 30 wt% mixed alkanolamine solutions containing MEA or AEEA with at least 10 wt% PZ were the appropriate absorbents compared with the single alkanolamine and the mixed alkanolamine solutions containing AMP. A higher portion of PZ in a mixture was more favourable to CO 2 capture. Because of short contact time in a RPB, alkanolamines with high reaction rate with CO 2 are suggested to use. For the solutions containing 15 wt% MEA or AEEA and 15  wt% PZ, the highest gas flow rate allowed to achieve a capture efficiency more than 90 % were 30  L/min at a solution of 100 mL/min and 50 L/min at a solution of 300  mL/min.

The carbon bed provided rapid heating (∼ 18 °C/min) and a localized reaction hot zone that thermally promoted extensive pyrolysis cracking of the waste oil at 450 °C, leading to increased production of a biofuel product in a process taking less than 25 min. It also created a reducing reaction environment that prevented the formation of undesirable oxidized compounds in the biofuel. The pyrolysis produced a biofuel product that is low in oxygen, free of sulphur, carboxylic acid and triglycerides, and which also contains light C 10 -C 15 hydrocarbons and a high calorific value nearly comparable to diesel fuel, thus showing great potential {{to be used as}} fuel. This pyrolysis approach offers an attractive alternative to transesterification that avoids the use of solvents and catalysts, and the need to remove free fatty acids and glycerol from the hydrocarbon product.

40|$|A {{dual-stage}} {{method was}} developed to first efficaciously degrade metaldehyde into acetaldehyde, before subsequent removal of acetaldehyde using an amine functionalized ion-exchange resin. A range of Macronets, with different surface areas, pore volumes, pore size distributions and extents of functionalisation were evaluated for the depolymerisation of metaldehyde. NMR spectroscopy was used to confirm the compete degradation of metaldehyde by the selected Macronets. Kinetic studies showed that the rates of catalytic degradation were primarily determined by the porous structure of the materials rather than the extent of surface functionalization, since high levels of acid surface groups were observed to decrease the porosity significantly. The rate constants obtained show excellent correlation with non-micro pore volumes, which are of import as the only pores that are accessible to hydrogen bonded metaldehyde molecules; Macronet MN 502 exhibits the largest non-micro pore volume and, hence, demonstrated the best kinetic performance. The effect of competing ions on catalytic performance was also studied and the results demonstrate that competing ions compromise {{the performance of the}} proposed system to some extent, however, it is notable that a good level of performance is maintained even for competing ion concentrations as high as 100 times that of metaldehyde. Isothermal studies of acetaldehyde onto ion-exchange resin A 830, including kinetic evaluation, showed that acetaldehyde could be chemically adsorbed by the resin. Consequently, a dual-column system was proposed, which was determined to effectively degrade metaldehyde (MN 502) and remove the resulting by-product, acetaldehyde, via a second fixed <b>bed</b> <b>absorber</b> (A 830); this method could easily be adapted to existing facilities in water treatment works, making it very cost-effective and of great practical interest...|$|R

The proposed system includes a counter-flow packed <b>bed</b> <b>absorber,</b> a counter-flow packed bed regenerator and a solar water heating system which consists of an array of flat plate solar collectors integrated with a thermal storage tank and an electric heater. It is designed {{to benefit from the}} low cost evaporative cooling technique in cooling the dehumidified processed air and the strong desiccant solution. Heat exchangers are used to improve the thermal performance of the system or prevent the direct contact between the liquid desiccant and water. Various aspects such as proper system design, selection of appropriate types of dehumidifiers and liquid desiccants, and modelling of the different system components are addressed in this study. Lithium chloride solution is utilised as the working fluid owing to its excellent dehumidification performance and low regeneration energy requirements. A simplified approach has been developed to predict the size and the pressure drop of the absorber and regenerator at the design stage. A parametric study has been carried out to investigate the effects of various design and operational variables on the overall system performance, especially on the performance of the absorber and regenerator. A thorough simulation platform for the proposed system has been developed using the Matlab Simulink integrating the models of the individual components developed and selected. The results revealed that enormous free solar energy for Sydney location could be used to reduce the electricity consumption in re-concentrating the liquid desiccant. The simulation results indicated that the proposed system has an average daily thermal coefficient of performance of 0. 5 - 0. 55.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} technical feasibility of upgrading the Waste Experimental Reduction Facility (WERF) at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory to meet the offgas emission limits proposed in the Maximum Achievable Control Technologies (MACT) rule. Four practicable offgas treatment processes were identified, which, if installed, would enable the WERF to meet the anticipated MACT emission limits for dioxins and furans (D/F), hydrochloric acid (HCI), and mercury (Hg). Due to the three-year time restraint for MACT compliance, any technology chosen for the upgrade must be performed within the general plant project funding limit of $ 5 M. The option selected consists of a partial-quench evaporative cooler with dry sorbent injection for HCI removal followed by a sulfur-impregnated activated carbon bed for Hg control. The planning cost estimate for implementing the option is $ 4. 17 M (with 24 % contingency). The total estimated cost includes capital costs, design and construction costs, and project management costs. Capital costs include {{the purchase of a}} new offgas evaporative cooler, a dry sorbent injection system with reagent storage, a new fabric filter baghouse, a fixed carbon <b>bed</b> <b>absorber,</b> and two offgas induced draft exhaust fans. It is estimated that 21 months will be required to complete the recommended modification to the WERF. The partial-quench cooler is designed to rapidly cool the offgas exiting the secondary combustion chamber to minimize D/F formation. Dry sorbent injection of an alkali reagent into the offgas is recommended. The alkali reacts with the HCI to form a salt, which is captured with the fly ash in the baghouse. A design HCI removal efficiency of 97. 2 % allows for the feeding 20 lbs/hr of chlorine to the WERF incinerator. The sorbent feed rate can be adjusted to achieve the desired HCI removal efficiency. A fixed bed of sulfur-impregnated carbon was conservatively sized for a total Hg removal capacity when feeding 10 g/hr Hg to the WERF incinerator. An added benefit for using carbon adsorption is that the activated carbon will also capture a large fraction of any residual D/F present in the offgas...|$|R
40|$|This PhD Thesis {{analyses}} {{the technical}} and economic feasibility of the gasification {{of one of the}} most promising energy crops in terms of biomass yield and plantation costs: Cynara cardunculus L. (cynara). The aim of this analysis is to assess the bioenergy production via fluidized bed gasification (FBG) and the ulterior treatment of the synthesis gas (syngas) produced in the FBG reactor to adequate it to end-use applications such as gas turbines and internal combustion engines. To achieve this objective, this thesis proposes a formulation model approach for evaluating the electricity generation costs (Chapter 2), the reactor performance (Chapter 3) and the syngas conditioning efficiency (Chapter 4). For this purpose, the Autonomous Community of Madrid (CAM) has been taken as study case. The analysis estimates that the cynara has the potential to provide 1708 GWh yr- 1, that is, around 42 % of national biomass-based electricity supply and exceeds 72 % of total renewable-based electricity supply in CAM. Therefore, the implementation of cynara projects could help reducing the total energy consumption of CAM by 0. 05 %, what would suppose to avoid up to 66 % of CO 2 emissions from fossil fuels. The economic assessment performed in the present work evaluates the use of two thermochemical technologies for cynara conversion into electricity to be used for different applications or sold to the national grid. The technological solutions considered are: a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant and an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) power generator. The CCGT solution was studied for an installed capacity range of 5 - 30 MW, while the ICE solution was analysed for a range of 1 - 30 MW. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the effects of variables such as biomass yield, discount rate, transport cost, operation and maintenance. For a cynara yield of 17 t/ha in an 8 MW plant as base case, the economic analysis estimates a production costs of 21. 60 c€/kWh and 24. 32 c€/kW for the CCGT and ICE solutions, respectively. Accordingly, CCGT plants are the best choice for a plant size above 8 MW, while ICE plants constitute the most suitable technology below 8 MW. With regards to the discount rate, the results show that for the same base case (8 MW), for a discount rate of 10 % the cost of electricity is estimated to be 16. 69 c€/kWh for CCGT plants and 19. 08 c€/kWh for ICE plants. On the contrary, the use of the lowest discount rate (1 %) yields a cost of electricity of 12. 70 and 15. 13 c€/kWh for CCGT and ICE solutions, respectively. Concerning to the total capital investment, it grows with the plant size, representing up to 93 and 92 % of the total CCGT and ICE plant cost, respectively. Such percentages correspond to 42. 17 M€ and 41. 46 M€ for a CCGT and ICE plant for a base case of 8 MW. Nevertheless, the ICE plants show a stronger economy of scale in energy production than the CCGT solution. In addition to this, the total operating costs for an 8 MW CCGT scenario is estimated to be 2. 94 M€ and around 3. 65 M€ for an ICE plant. In relation to the thermochemical conversion route of cynara, the gasification of biomass in a FB reactor has been modelled to analyse such process for Cynara cardunculus L. taking into consideration the particular biomass behavior. It is well known that the FB reactor thermal state and the biomass volatiles generation are crucial in its operation and performance. Hence, the bubble flow pattern controls the FB temperature profile driving devolatilization and tars cracking kinetics. This underlies in the fact that alkali compounds of biomass fuels, which are featured by a low melting point, can transform into vapours and ash fly that are prone to deposit on heat surfaces in boilers and/or react with the particles of the inert bed material inside the FB. Thus, the formation of agglomerates (the so-called bed agglomeration) would start and then, the defluidization of FB leading to the shut-down of the FBG reactor. Therefore, a modelling approach focused on the bubble phase, which can act as “bypassing” hot spots inside the FB region influencing on ash-related problems, can help to monitor the location of ash sintering and bed agglomeration risk regions and predict undesired FBG reactor performance. A new formulation for biomass FBG reactor modelling that considers the instantaneous devolatilization and temperature peaks due to volatiles combustion inside the FB region is proposed in the present work. A bubble phase and a FB energy balance are used to monitor the gradual release of biomass volatiles along the FB and to check the performance of the FBG reactor. The one-dimensional, steady-state proposed model uses a two-phase (bubble and emulsion) and two zone (bottom dense bed and upper freeboard) modelling approach to account for the complex nature of FBG reactor dynamics. Furthermore, no catalytic effects of ash composition from biomass are taken into consideration. For further validation and tuning up of the model proposed, a sensitivity analysis of cynara gasification in FB, under bubbling regime, was performed considering the specification design of the pilot-plant scale FBG reactor in the Thermal and Fluid Engineering Department facilities at Carlos III University of Madrid. The simulation campaign yields a syngas composition (on dry basis) of 4. 79 - 14. 84 % for CO, 19. 77 - 21. 35 % for CO 2, 6. 11 - 15. 00 % for H 2 and 2. 16 - 5. 73 % for CH 4. Besides, the lower heating value and tar content of the syngas fall in the range of 2. 25 - 6. 25 MJ/Nm 3 and 60 - 180 g/Nm 3, respectively. These results correspond to a syngas-biomass flows ratio in the range of 1. 309 - 2. 392 Nm 3 /kg, accounting for N 2 in the raw syngas produced. The analysis of the results in comparison with previous experiments stands out: 1) the good predictive capability of the model proposed and 2) the discrepancies between simulations and experimental works are attributable to the data heterogeneity found in the literature, that is, different biomass compositions, operating conditions, (catalytic) bed material used, sampling methods for syngas and tar compositions, etc. Hence, further experimental research would help improving the predictive capability of the proposed model. Finally, the conditioning of the syngas produced from the FBG reactor is needed in order to achieve end-use requirements in ICE and gas turbines (GT) plants, since the lack or inefficiency of syngas clean-up could lead to operational problems in downstream equipment and then, unscheduled shut-down and extra maintenance and repair costs. For example, particulate material can cause clogging and fouling, while tars can condensate producing blockage and attrition in filters, exit pipes, heat exchangers, etc. Furthermore, the syngas treatment to reduce its pollutants would influence the performance, investment and operational costs of the gas cleaning devices. Nowadays, gas cleaning systems are aimed to reduce particulate and tars material levels below the allowable concentrations (mg/Nm 3) for ICE and GT devices: 50 - 50 and 30 - 5, respectively. Thus, as a part of the present thesis, the modelling and analysis of a moving bed heat exchange filter (MBHEF) is proposed as hot gas clean-up equipment. The MBHEF stands out because its benefits: high temperature operation (700 - 800 ºC the exhaust gas temperature from the FB reactor), no-clogging and non-pressure increase during operation, which can lead to unscheduled shut-down if using other typical hot gas cleaning devices such as ceramic filters, bag filters. Additionally, the MBHEF would provide a high contact area between gas and solids without entrainment nor elutriation of solids. This compact size equipment would allow saving costs. Eventually, the MBHEF solution for hot gas cleaning would also avoid extra costs derived from the reactor design modification and the use of additives/catalysts in order to remove tars. It is presented a modelling approach for simulating tars and particulate removal in a MBHEF. The two-dimension, adiabatic, steady-state proposed model accounts for twophase (gas and solid) and neglects conduction and mass diffusion. Tars condensation is modelled through representative tar class lumps: phenol (class 2), naphthalene (class 4), and pyrene (class 5) according to the literature. The model also considers tar concentration influence on tar dew point, while the filtration model is taken from literature. Furthermore, an exergy study was conducted in order to optimise the equipment size and help the choice of the less expensive operating conditions. A sensitivity analysis was performed varying the particle size and superficial gas velocity as key operating parameters. To accomplish this, a syngas composition from experiments reported in the literature has been taken as study case. Thus, maps of temperature, tars abatement and particulate removal efficiencies are presented, which show the MBHEF performance for reducing impurities content. The simulation results indicate the feasibility of use a MBHEF as tars removal equipment benefiting its advantages against other gas-cleaning methods with acceptable pollutant removal efficiencies, ranging 88 - 94 %. As observed, the MBHEF yields efficiencies, at least, the same order of magnitude of the ones attainable with the use of catalytic crackers, venture scrubbers or sand filter at much lower temperatures and higher than the ones achieved by means of wash towers, wet electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters and fixed <b>bed</b> <b>absorbers.</b> In case of not reaching the reduction level for each end-use application, the MBHEF device can be used as effective secondary removal method for eliminating tars from the syngas, with the advantages stated above as opposed the rest of removal technologies. Results also point out that low gas velocities (0. 5 - 1 m/s) and high particle size (400 - 700 μm) for saving costs are the most suitable|$|R
