The <b>anchor</b> <b>cell</b> also produces another signal (the Notch ligand LAG-2) that induces adjacent uterine cells to become the π cells, some of which will later connect the uterus to the vulva. The <b>anchor</b> <b>cell</b> next removes the basement membrane that separates the uterus and vulva and invades, initiating {{the connection between the}} uterus and the vulva. Finally the <b>anchor</b> <b>cell</b> fuses with eight of the π cells to form the uterine seam cell.|$|E
50|$|The six VPCs form an {{equivalence}} {{group because}} all of the six cells are competent to take on any of the available fates (1°, 2°, and 3°) dependent on their proximity to the <b>anchor</b> <b>cell.</b> Ablation experiments indicate that all VPCs are able to adopt vulva fates. For example, if the P6.p cell that normally becomes 1° is ablated then the VPC closest to the <b>anchor</b> <b>cell,</b> either P5.p or P7.p, assumes the 1° fate. Furthermore, if all VPCs are destroyed except the most anterior P3.p cell then the <b>anchor</b> <b>cell</b> designates this cell the 1° fate.

5000|$|The <b>anchor</b> <b>cell</b> {{directly}} induces the vulva fates by secreting the epidermal {{growth factor}} (EGF)-like ligand LIN-3. The P6.p cell receives the LIN-3 signal via the receptor tyrosine kinase LET-23 (P5.p and P7.p also receive LIN-3 but to a lesser extent). Activation of LET-23 in P6.p results in the activation of LIN-12 (Notch) in P5.p and P7.p. Experimental evidence shows that LIN-12 is necessary and sufficient {{for the formation of}} the 2° fate. Through lateral inhibition LIN-12 prevents the P5.p and P7.p cells from adopting the 1° lineage.

40|$|AbstractDuring Caenorhabditis elegans {{hermaphrodite}} development, the <b>anchor</b> <b>cell</b> induces the vulva and the uterine π cells whose daughters {{connect to}} the vulva, thereby organizing the uterine–vulval connection. Both the initial selection of a single <b>anchor</b> <b>cell</b> during the <b>anchor</b> <b>cell</b> vs. ventral uterine precursor cell decision and the subsequent induction of the π cell fate by the <b>anchor</b> <b>cell</b> are mediated by the lin- 12 gene. Members of the presenilin gene family can cause early onset Alzheimer's disease when mutated and are also required for LIN- 12 /Notch signaling during development. We have shown that, in C. elegans, mutation of the sel- 12 -encoded presenilin results in π cell induction defects. By contrast, other lin- 12 -mediated cell fate decisions occur normally in sel- 12 mutants due to the redundant function of a second C. elegans presenilin called HOP- 1. We found that the sel- 12 egg-laying defect was partially rescued by expression of the sel- 12 gene in the π cells. sel- 12 -mediated π cell fate specification provides a useful system {{for the analysis of}} presenilin function at single cell resolution...|$|E

40|$|Development of the {{nematode}} egg-laying system {{requires the}} formation of a connection between the uterine lumen acid the developing vulval lumen, thus allowing a passage for eggs and sperm. This relatively simple process serves as a model for certain aspects of organogenesis. Such a connection demands that cells in both tissues become specialized to participate in the connection, and that the specialized cells are brought in register. A single cell, the <b>anchor</b> <b>cell,</b> acts to induce and to organize specialization of the epidermal and uterine epithelia, and registrates these tissues. The inductions act via evolutionarily conserved intercellular signaling pathways.

40|$|The Caenorhabditis elegans {{hermaphrodite}} egg-laying system comprises several tissues, {{including the}} uterus and vulva. lin- 11 encodes a LIM domain transcription factor needed for certain vulval precursor cells to divide asymmetrically.

To investigate the role of CWAP of non-pathogen Gram-positive bacteria in the initial steps of biofilm formation, we evaluated the physico-chemical properties and adhesion to solid surfaces of Lactococcus lactis. To be able to grow in milk this dairy bacterium expresses a <b>cell</b> wall <b>anchored</b> proteinase PrtP for breakdown of milk caseins. Results The influence of the <b>anchored</b> <b>cell</b> wall proteinase PrtP on microbial surface physico-chemical properties, and consequently on adhesion, was evaluated using lactococci carrying different alleles of prtP. The presence of <b>cell</b> wall <b>anchored</b> proteinase on the surface of lactococcal cells resulted in an increased affinity to solvents with different physico-chemical properties (apolar and Lewis acid-base solvents).

40|$|Background: Free-living flatworms, in both {{marine and}} {{freshwater}} environments, {{are able to}} adhere to and release from a substrate several times within a second. This reversible adhesion relies on adhesive organs comprised of three cell types: an adhesive gland cell, a releasing gland cell, and an <b>anchor</b> <b>cell,</b> which is a modified epidermal cell responsible for structural support. However, nothing is currently known about the molecules {{that are involved in}} this adhesion process. Results: In this study we present the detailed morphology of the adhesive organs of the free-living marine flatworm Macrostomum lignano. About 130 adhesive organs are located in a horse-shoe-shaped arc along the ventral side of the tail plate. Each organ consists of exactly three cells, an adhesive gland cell, a releasing gland cell, and an <b>anchor</b> <b>cell.</b> The necks of the two gland cells penetrate the <b>anchor</b> <b>cell</b> through a common pore. Modified microvilli of the <b>anchor</b> <b>cell</b> form a collar surrounding the necks of the adhesive- and releasing glands, jointly forming the papilla, the outer visible part of the adhesive organs. Next, we identified an intermediate filament (IF) gene, macif 1, which is expressed in the anchor cells. RNA interference mediated knock-down resulted in the first experimentally induced non-adhesion phenotype in any marine animal. Specifically, the absence of intermediate filaments in the anchor cells led to papillae with open tips, a reduction of the cytoskeleton network, a decline in hemidesmosomal connections, and to shortened microvilli containing less actin. Conclusion: Our findings reveal an elaborate biological adhesion system in a free-living flatworm, which permits impressively rapid temporary adhesion-release performance in the marine environment. We demonstrate that the structural integrity of the supportive cell, the <b>anchor</b> <b>cell,</b> is essential for this adhesion process: the knock-down of the anchor cell-specific intermediate filament gene resulted in the inability of the animals to adhere. The RNAi mediated changes of the <b>anchor</b> <b>cell</b> morphology are comparable to situations observed in human gut epithelia. Therefore, our current findings and future investigations using this powerful flatworm model system might contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the function of intermediate filaments and their associated human diseases...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of the vulva of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is induced by a signal from the <b>anchor</b> <b>cell</b> of the somatic gonad. Activity of the gene lin- 3 {{is required for the}} Vulval Precursor Cells (VPCs) to assume vulval fates. It is shown here that lin- 3 encodes the vulval-inducing signal. lin- 3 was molecularly cloned by transposon-tagging and shown to encode a nematode member ofthe Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) family. Genetic epistasis experiments indicate that lin- 3 acts upstream of let- 23, which encodes a homologue of the EGF-Receptor. lin- 3 transgenes that contain multiple copies of wild-type lin- 3 genomic DNA clones confer a dominant multivulva phenotype in which up to all six of the VPCs assume vulval fates. The properties of these trans genes suggest that lin- 3 can act in the <b>anchor</b> <b>cell</b> to induce vulval fates. Ablation of the gonadal precursors, which prevents the {{development of}} the AC, strongly reduces the ability of lin- 3 transgenes to stimulate vulval development. A lin- 3 recorder transgene that retains the ability to stimulate vulval development is expressed specifically in the <b>anchor</b> <b>cell</b> at the time of vulval induction. Expression of an obligate secreted form of the EGF domain of Lin-S from a heterologous promoter is sufficient to induce vulval fates {{in the absence of the}} normal source of the inductive signal. This result suggests that Lin-S may act as a secreted factor, and that Lin-S may be the sole vulval-inducing signal made by the <b>anchor</b> <b>cell.</b> lin- 3 transgenes can cause adjacent VPCs to assume the 1 ° vulval fate and thus can override the action of the lateral signal mediated by lin- 12 that normally prevents adjacent 1 ° fates.
