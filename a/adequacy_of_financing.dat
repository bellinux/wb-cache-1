40|$|Triggered by {{the need}} to make {{decisions}} concerning the purchase or investment in new economic entities, with correct and detailed information on their status and economic development conditions, the due diligence process identifies ever better its role and meaning. Knowing the impact generated by the financing strategy on organizational values, as well as the factors that {{play a role in the}} process of evaluating the financial structure are essential elements that contribute to the success of such an approach. Based on a sample made up of 60 companies quoted in the Bucharest Stock exchange, this study aims to draw a series of mathematical models that could be used as instruments for the identification and quantification of the influences generated by the financial structure on the companies’ value. At the same time, this study attempts to identify the internal factors, specific to the company, that determine the composition of the financial structure, as well as the sense and intensity of their actions upon financial leverage. This paper introduces in the analysis the influence of specific activity to the indebtedness, reflecting the need for assessing the <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>financing</b> strategies based on the activity filed of the enterprises. To obtain the research results, methods of data analysis were used such as: ratios technique, multiple linear regression analysis and linear regression analysis with alternative independent variables, ANCOVA type.

40|$|Purpose: The general {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to assess the factors influencing provision of health care in a devolved system of government, with a special focus on Bungoma County. Methodology: The research design was a descriptive survey utilizing both the quantitative and qualitative aspect. The target population will be all the heads of the health facilities in Bungoma County. The sampling technique will be Non Probability Sampling where Purposive Sampling will be used to identify all the heads of government hospitals, Health Centers and dispensaries in the county as they possess the relevant knowledge required for the study. Questionnaires will then be used to obtain primary data. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 12) was used to analyze quantitative data and presented using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data will be analyzed using thematic analysis and presented in form of narratives and themes. Results: Based on the findings the study concluded that disbursement and <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>finances,</b> supplies and equipment affected health care provision in a devolved system of government. The study also concluded that drugs procurement challenges affected health care provision in a devolved system of government. Findings further concluded that disbursement and <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>finances,</b> supplies and equipment has a positive and significant effect on health care provision as supported by (r= 0. 502, p= 0. 002). However, procurement challenges has a positively and insignificant association on health care provision as supported (r= 0. 309, p= 0. 603) The results revealed that healthcare personnel had a positively and a significantly association to health care provision (r= 0. 406, p= 0. 013). Policy recommendation: The findings of this study will be of great significance to the ministries of Health and that of Devolution and Planning plus the County Governments in Kenya on the factors that face devolution of health in order to come up with practical solutions.

40|$|Global {{climate change}} has moved {{high on the}} agenda of key policy makers in many {{industrial}} countries. As a â€œglobal public good,â€ a coordinated global response in terms of efforts at mitigation will be critically necessary. Equally, many countries will face serious economic harm in the absence of adaptation efforts. As one of the key global institutions with responsibility for global economic stability and growth, this paper argues that climate change should be on the economic surveillance agenda of the International Monetary Fund, with the focus principally on the macroeconomic implications. While the IMF’s role would be necessarily limited, the paper raises questions about the <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>financing</b> and organization <b>of</b> current global coordination mechanisms to address climate change. ...|$|R

This paper estimates the present value of lifetime healthcare expenses (PVHE) of the Singaporean male and female elderly upon retirement at age 62. The estimation involves calibrating the stream of future healthcare expenditure; stochastic forecasting of cohort survival probabilities; and discounting the projected lifetime healthcare expenditure.

40|$|Individuals {{with serious}} mental illness {{experience}} numerous barriers that prevent achieving a meaningful life, {{as well as}} {{increase the risk of}} social isolation and ostracism. However, recovery from serious mental illness is an emerging reality for many who experience psychiatric illness. Psychiatric rehabilitation programs that promote recovery, community integration, and acceptance aim to combat the potentially detrimental consequences of mental illness. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine how inter/intrapersonal variables, such as sense of mattering, sense of community, and perceived stigma influence recovery from mental illness among consumers who participate in psychiatric rehabilitation programs, known as clubhouses. In addition, readiness for change was examined to determine if stage of change was predictive of greater recovery. This study involved in-depth interviews with 143 mental health consumers from 10 clubhouses in Michigan. The Recovery Assessment Scale was used to measure the subjective experience of recovery. Functional indicators of recovery, such as decrease in symptoms and <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>finances,</b> were predictive <b>of,</b> and therefore substantiated, the subjective experience of recovery. Multivariate regression analysis revealed consumers that spent more time at the clubhouse was predictive of stages of change. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that consumers experienced greater recovery when they perceived less stigmatizing attitudes about their illness and experienced a personal sense of mattering and sense of community. In addition, experiencing a sense of mattering was significant in reducing perceived stigma. Based on the theoretical framework of the belongingness hypothesis a conceptual model was developed identifying sense of belonging as the underpinnings for the development of recovery. Hypothesized relationships between specific constructs were examined using Structural Equation Modeling. The conceptualized model provided a good fit for the data and indicated that sense of belonging significantly predicts factors of recovery including, positive identity, hope and meaning, and illness responsibility and support. These results offer clinical implications and implore further research on sense of mattering and achieving recovery...|$|R
40|$|The {{needs for}} {{long-term}} care (LTC) are expected to increase gradually due to population ageing in Europe. The population aged 65 or older, which is more at risk of dependency, will more than double by 2050 according to the forecasts of the European Union (Pestieau & Ponthière 2010). It is however unclear if the population in need for care will increase in the same proportion due to compression of morbidity (potential increase of life expectancy in good health). In assessing the <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>financing</b> and provision <b>of</b> long-term care, {{it is important to}} take into account the abilities of the countries to rely on the informal provision of care to older individuals in the future. Recent studies, using inter alia SHARE data (e. g. Bolin et al. 2008), showed that long-term care is mainly provided by informal caregivers. In this paper, we show that children and especially daughters play an important role in the supply of informal care. Then we prove that the availability of potential informal caregivers, i. e. the children, decreases the probability of purchasing private voluntary long-term care insurance. Future research on long-term care should focus on characteristics of potential substitutes for insurance policies (children and partner). Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{societies}} {{have failed to}} find affordable ways to fund needed infrastructure. Problems have multiplied from ignoring the particular characteristics of infrastructure and assuming the <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> the conventional <b>finance</b> <b>of</b> recent times, be this publicly or privately sourced. These failures, compounded by insensitive monetary stances, {{have led to a}} lingering economic and financial malaise, one particularly evident in some regions. Such failures have also contributed to the parlous position of many governments and the current global crisis. Infrastructure affordability is a central theme in this paper. Affordability, investment and credit are explored using simple numerical illustrations to highlight important aspects of probably the most pervasive means <b>of</b> <b>finance,</b> debt. Interest rate and other movements over decades can generate significant variations in yields realised from investments. Conditions over recent decades appear to have made debt-financed infrastructure more unaffordable than any time in the century since the States of Australia federated. It is little wonder that all States are currently struggling with infrastructure provision. A new era may be emerging from current crises but its eventual success, or otherwise, will reflect how well (un-) affordability is addressed. Prospective yields on investments need to be sufficiently realisable. Recognition and accommodation of the peculiarities of various forms of investment will be part of any adequate new foundations. The “infrastructure (un-) affordability problem” needs to be much better appreciated, understood and accommodated, by private and public parties alike...|$|R

40|$|Entrepreneurship and SME {{sector is}} {{extremely}} important for general economic development in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In order to enhance further development of the SME sector adequate sources <b>of</b> <b>financing</b> for businesses need to be available and accessible. Entrepreneurs and owners of small and medium businesses in Bosnia and Herzegovina are facing certain challenges in obtaining <b>finances.</b> The issue <b>of</b> accessing sources <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> for SMEs {{in this country has}} remained problematic for years. Many relevant studies worldwide emphasise the importance of adequate sources <b>of</b> <b>financing</b> entrepreneurship and SME development. However, a variety <b>of</b> factors influence <b>financing</b> <b>of</b> SMEs depending on the region, economic development, development of financial markets etc. In this paper the authors are addressing the problem <b>of</b> <b>financing</b> SMEs focusing on the governmental support, with emphasis on Bosnia and Herzegovina. The main aim of the paper is to provide an answer to the question whether the government support in Bosnia and Herzegovina enables SMEs to access initial financing, needed for their entrepreneurial activity. The paper presents results of an empirical research conducted among managers of SMEs in Bosnia and Herzegovina in regards to availability and <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> financial products for these businesses. The results indicate that entrepreneurs in B&H rarely use government funds as a source <b>of</b> <b>financing</b> business activities, which is mostly caused by insufficient funds and inefficient government procedures...|$|R
