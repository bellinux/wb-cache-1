25|$|A “flapping tremor,” or <b>asterixis,</b> is {{characterized}} by irregular flapping-hand movement, which appears most often with outstretched arms and wrist extension. Individuals with this condition resemble birds flapping their wings.|$|E
25|$|Liver {{cirrhosis}} (with {{an increased}} risk of hepatocellular carcinoma) Liver disease is always preceded by evidence of liver dysfunction including elevated serum enzymes specific to the liver, clubbing of the fingers, leuconychia, <b>asterixis,</b> hepatomegaly, palmar erythema and spider naevi. Cirrhosis can also present with jaundice (yellowing of the skin) and ascites.|$|E
25|$|Alcoholism, {{excessive}} alcohol consumption, {{or alcohol}} withdrawal can kill certain nerve cells, {{resulting in a}} tremor known as <b>asterixis.</b> Conversely, small amounts of alcohol may help to decrease familial and essential tremor, but the mechanism behind it is unknown.

25|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} – {{the liver}} does not clear ammonia and related nitrogenous substances from the blood, which are {{carried to the}} brain, affecting cerebral functioning: neglect of personal appearance, unresponsiveness, forgetfulness, trouble concentrating, changes in sleep habits or psychosis may result.

500|$|More severe {{forms of}} hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{lead to a}} worsening level of consciousness, from lethargy to somnolence and eventually coma. In the intermediate stages, a characteristic jerking movement of the limbs is observed (<b>asterixis,</b> [...] "liver flap" [...] due to its flapping character); this disappears as the somnolence worsens. There is disorientation and amnesia, and uninhibited behaviour may occur. In the third stage, neurological examination may reveal clonus and positive Babinski sign. Coma and seizures represent the most advanced stage; cerebral oedema (swelling of the brain tissue) leads to death.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Asterixis</b> is seen {{most often}} in drowsy or stuporous {{patients}} with metabolic encephalopathies, especially in decompensated cirrhosis or acute liver failure.|$|E
5000|$|R.D. Adams and J.M. Foley first {{described}} <b>asterixis</b> in 1949 {{in patients with}} severe liver failure and encephalopathy. Initially Foley and Adams referred to <b>asterixis</b> simply as [...] "tremor" [...] but realized that they needed a more appropriate term. On a literature search they found a poorly described phenomenon in similar patients mentioned by German physicians called “jactitations” but the reference was vague. Foley consulted Father Cadigan, a Jesuit classics scholar, who suggested “anisosterixis” (an [...] "negative"-iso [...] "equal"-sterixis [...] "firmness") but Foley shortened this to <b>asterixis</b> due to the former being too difficult to pronounce. They introduced the term in 1953 {{by way of a}} medical abstract and later Adams solidified its medical use as he was an author and editor of the widely influential Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Asterixis</b> is the {{inability}} to maintain posture due to a metabolic encephalopathy. This can be elicited on physical exam by having the patient extend their arms and bend their hands back. With a metabolic encephalopathy, the patient is unable to hold their hands back resulting in a “flapping” motion consistent with <b>asterixis.</b> It {{can be seen in}} any metabolic encephalopathy e.g. chronic renal failure, severe congestive heart failure, acute respiratory failure and commonly in decompensated liver failure.|$|E
50|$|Some {{drugs are}} known to cause <b>asterixis,</b> {{particularly}} phenytoin (when it is known as phenytoin flap). Other drugs implicated include benzodiazepines, barbiturates, valproate, gabapentin, lithium, ceftazidime, and metoclopramide.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Asterixis</b> (also {{called the}} {{flapping}} tremor, or liver flap) is a tremor {{of the hand}} when the wrist is extended, sometimes said to resemble a bird flapping its wings. This motor disorder is characterized by an inability to maintain a position, which is demonstrated by jerking movements of the outstretched hands when bent upward at the wrist. The tremor is caused by abnormal function of the diencephalic motor centers in the brain, which regulate the muscles involved in maintaining position. <b>Asterixis</b> is associated with various encephalopathies due especially to faulty metabolism. The term derives from the Greek a, [...] "not" [...] and stērixis, [...] "fixed position".|$|E
50|$|Usually {{there are}} brief, arrhythmic interruptions of {{sustained}} voluntary muscle contraction causing brief lapses of posture, with a frequency of 3-5 Hz. It is bilateral, {{but may be}} asymmetric. Unilateral <b>asterixis</b> may occur with structural brain disease.|$|E

50|$|Many {{other causes}} for astasia have been reported, such as {{temporal}} hypoperfusion {{in the left}} hemisphere and posterior cingulate infarction. However, there have only been one or two cases in which these causes have been reported. There has also been one case that reported a patient showing a hemorrhage in the right thalamo-mesencephalic junction. This region involves important structures for the control of postural stability, motor control, ocular movements and vestibulo-ocular integration. This region of the brain is not yet well understood and according to current knowledge, {{this is the first}} reported case with the simultaneous combination of astasis, pretectal syndrome, and asymmetrical <b>asterixis.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Asterixis</b> {{is not yet}} {{considered}} a common neurological sign of cerebellum infarction, and the pathogenic mechanism for <b>asterixis</b> remains elusive. We report a 58 -year-old male with moderate hypertension who presented to our emergency department for acute headache in both cervical and occipital regions of the left side. About 2 hours later the patient developed ipsilateral <b>asterixis</b> in the upper left limb; 3 days later the <b>asterixis</b> disappeared. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain disclosed cerebellar infarctions at the left superior cerebellar artery. In conclusion, we observed that a transitory <b>asterixis</b> associated with ipsilateral headache can be an initial clinical manifestation of ipsilateral cerebellar infarctions in the superior cerebellar artery area.

40|$|<b>Asterixis</b> was {{studied in}} nine patients, {{using a new}} {{electrophysiological}} technique: silent period locked averaging (SPLA). There were two types of electromyographic (EMG) silence in the movements clinically judged as <b>asterixis.</b> The jerky movement {{in one of the}} two types might be caused by the silent period after the subclinical cortical myoclonus. SPLA would be useful for studying <b>asterixis</b> as well as other EMG silences...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Severe hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{gives rise to}} <b>asterixis,</b> a striking motor symptom also called flapping tremor, which {{is characterized by a}} sudden ceasing of muscle tone in all muscles of a limb. In this study, we aimed at scrutinizing the cortical activation associated with <b>asterixis</b> and unraveling the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Material and methods: We recorded simultaneously neural activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and muscle activity with surface EMG in nine patients with manifest {{hepatic encephalopathy}} showing <b>asterixis.</b> <b>Asterixis</b> events were detected semiautomatically and served as triggers for averaging MEG signals. Evoked responses averaged time-locked to <b>asterixis</b> events were subjected to equivalent current dipole (ECD) modeling. Additionally, we localized the strongest cortico-muscular coherence in the frequency of the co-occurring tremulousness. Results: Evoked fields averaged time-locked to <b>asterixis</b> events were best explained by a single dipolar source in the contralateral primary motor cortex (M 1, Talairach coordinates of mean localization: − 40, − 20, and 64; Brodmann area 4). This dipole showed a twofold field reversal, that is biphasic wave, with frontal dipole orientation at 49  ms before flap onset and 99  ms after flap onset. Conversely, two maxima with occipital dipole orientation were observed 2  ms and 160  ms after flap onset. Cortico-muscular coherence for the tremulousness was likewise localized in the contralateral M 1 confirming earlier findings in the present patient cohort. Conclusions: Our results reveal an involvement of M 1 in the generation of <b>asterixis.</b> As also tremulousness, also called mini-asterixis, was shown to originate in M 1, <b>asterixis</b> and mini-asterixis may share common pathophysiological mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Objective]:Unilateral <b>asterixis</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} in patients with thalamic lesion. This study aims at elucidating the pathophysiology of the thalamic <b>asterixis.</b> [Methods]:Two cases with unilateral <b>asterixis</b> caused by an infarction in the lateral thalamus were studied by analysing the asterixis-related cortical activities, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for motor cortex excitability and probabilistic diffusion tractography for the thalamo-cortical connectivity. [Results]:Averaging of electroencephalogram (EEG) time-locked to the <b>asterixis</b> revealed rhythmic oscillations of a beta band at the central area contralateral to the affected hand. TMS revealed a decrease in the motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and a prolongation of the silent period (SP). The anatomical mapping of connections between the thalamus and cortical areas using a diffusion-weighted image (DWI) showed that the lateral thalamus involved by the infarction was connected to the premotor cortex, the primary motor cortex (M 1) and the primary somatosensory cortex (S 1) of the corresponding hemisphere. [Conclusions]:The thalamic <b>asterixis</b> is mediated by the sensorimotor cortex, which is subjected to excessive inhibition {{as a result of the}} thalamic lesion involving the ventral lateral nucleus. [Significance]:This is the first demonstration of participation of the sensorimotor cortex in the generation of <b>asterixis</b> due to the lateral thalamic lesion...|$|E

Pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity and teratogenicity are the most significant adverse drug reactions. Cases of hyperammonemia are rarely reported as VPA-induced, probably because this increased level of ammonia in blood can vary between asymptomatic, with an incidence of 16 - 52 % (Carr & Sherwsbury 2007), and clinically relevant levels. Symptomatology due to VPA-induced hyperammonemia include: lethargy, impaired consciousness, focal neurological signs and symptoms and increased seizure frequency.
