5|$|Dohavali (दोहावली, 1581), {{literally}} Collection of Dohas, {{is a work}} {{consisting of}} 573 miscellaneous Doha and Sortha verses mainly in Braja with some verses in Awadhi. The verses are aphorisms on topics related to tact, political wisdom, righteousness <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> life. 85 Dohas from this work are {{also found in the}} Ramcharitmanas, 35 in Ramagya Prashna, two in Vairagya Sandipani and some in Rama Satsai, another work of 700 Dohas attributed to Tulsidas.|$|E
5|$|Meher Baba's teachings can roughly {{be divided}} into two main categories: his metaphysics {{on the nature of the}} soul and the Universe, and {{practical}} advice for the spiritual aspirant. The two are interrelated. His metaphysics is mostly found in his principal book on the subject, God Speaks. It contains detailed statements on his cosmology <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> life as well as the progression of the soul, while his elucidations on the practical spiritual life are mostly contained in Discourses, although it also covers many metaphysical areas mirroring or amplifying God Speaks.|$|E
5|$|The Platonic {{influence}} on Maximus' thought {{can be seen}} most clearly in his theological anthropology. Here, Maximus adopted the Platonic model of exitus-reditus (exit and return), teaching that humanity {{was made in the}} image of God, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> salvation is to restore us to unity with God. This emphasis on divinization or theosis helped secure Maximus' place in Eastern theology, as these concepts have always held an important place in Eastern Christianity.|$|E

25|$|The square is {{normally}} {{open to the}} public, but remains under heavy security. Before entry, visitors and their belongings are searched, a common practice at many Chinese tourist sites, although the square is somewhat unusual in that domestic visitors often have their identification documents checked <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> their visit questioned.

25|$|Generations passed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> {{the monastery}} was forgotten. A small town named Tristram sprang {{up next to}} the monastery's ruins. When King Leoric rebuilt the monastery as a cathedral, Diablo {{manipulated}} its archbishop, Lazarus, to destroy his soulstone prison. Diablo subsequently possessed the king, sending out his knights and priests to battle against peaceful kingdoms, and then possessed the king's son, Prince Albrecht, filling the caves and catacombs beneath the cathedral with creatures formed from the young boy's nightmares.|$|E

There are some notable Huichol artists in the yarn painting and beadwork fields, and both types of work have been commissioned for public display.|$|E

25|$|Manichaeism conceives of two coexistent {{realms of}} light and {{darkness}} that become embroiled in conflict. Certain elements of the light became entrapped within darkness, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> material creation is {{to engage in the}} slow process of extraction of these individual elements. In the end the kingdom of light will prevail over darkness. Manicheanism inherits this dualistic mythology from Zurvanist Zoroastrianism, in which the eternal spirit Ahura Mazda is opposed by his antithesis, Angra Mainyu. This dualistic teaching embodied an elaborate cosmological myth that included the defeat of a primal man by the powers of darkness that devoured and imprisoned the particles of light.|$|E
25|$|Obligatory Bahá'í {{prayers are}} prayers which {{are to be}} said daily by Bahá'ís {{according}} to a fixed form decreed by Bahá'u'lláh. Prayers in the Bahá'í Faith are reverent words which are addressed to God, and refers to two distinct concepts: obligatory prayer and devotional prayer (general prayer). The act of prayer {{is one of the}} most important Bahá'í laws for individual discipline. Along with fasting, obligatory prayer is one of the greatest obligations of a Bahá'í, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the obligatory prayer is to foster the development of humility and devotion. The obligation of daily obligatory prayer was prescribed by Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, in his book of laws, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.|$|E
25|$|Jewish mysticism {{depicts the}} Tree of Life {{in the form}} of ten {{interconnected}} nodes, as the central symbol of the Kabbalah. It comprises the ten Sephirot powers in the Divine realm. The panentheistic and anthropomorphic emphasis of this emanationist theology interpreted the Torah, Jewish observance, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> Creation as the symbolic esoteric drama of unification in the Sephirot, restoring harmony to Creation. From the time of the Renaissance onwards, Jewish Kabbalah became incorporated as an important tradition in non-Jewish Western culture, first through its adoption by Christian Cabala, and continuing in Western esotericism occult Hermetic Qabalah. These adapted the Judaic Kabbalah Tree of Life syncretically by associating it with other religious traditions, esoteric theologies, and magical practices.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary {{voluntary}} decision prediction tasks {{have been}} criticised {{based on the}} possibility the neuronal signatures for pre-conscious decisions could actually correspond to lower conscious processing rather than unconscious processing. People may be aware of their decisions before making their report yet need to wait several seconds to be certain. Such a model does not however explain what is left unconscious if everything can be conscious at some level (<b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> defining separate systems). Yet limitations remain in free will prediction research to date. In particular, the prediction of considered judgements from brain activity involving thought processes beginning minutes rather than seconds before a conscious will to act, including the rejection of a conflicting desire. Such are generally seen to be the product of sequences of evidence accumulating judgements.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{with the}} Religions Law of May 1938, a cult of Emperor-worship closely {{modeled after the}} Imperial cult in Japan where the Showa Emperor was worshiped as a living god, began in Manchukuo. Just as in Japan, {{schoolchildren}} began their classes by praying to {{a portrait of the}} emperor while imperial rescripts and the imperial regalia become sacred relics imbued with magical powers by being associated with the god-emperor. As the Emperor Puyi was considered to be a living god, his will could not be limited by any law, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the law was starkly reduced down to serving the will of the emperor rather than upholding values and rules. As in Japan, the idea governing the legal philosophy in Manchukuo was the Emperor was a living god who was responsible to no-one and who delegated some of his powers down to mere human beings who had the duty of obeying the will of the god-emperors. In Japan and Manchukuo, the actions of the god-emperors were always just and moral because gods could never do wrong, rather than because the god-emperors were acting to uphold moral values that existed a prior.|$|E

500|$|Whorf {{was also}} {{influenced}} by gestalt psychology, believing that languages require their speakers to describe the same events as different gestalt constructions, which he called [...] "isolates from experience". An example is how the action of cleaning a gun is different in English and Shawnee: English focuses on the instrumental relation between two objects <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the action (removing dirt); whereas the Shawnee language focuses on the movement—using an arm to create a dry space in a hole.
