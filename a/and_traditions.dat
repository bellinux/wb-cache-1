40|$|Culture <b>and</b> <b>tradition</b> are two highly contested {{concepts}} in religious education. Grounding their theoretical contribution in concrete practice, the authors {{begin with a}} report on a summer camp with young adults and analyze that experience in light of concepts of culture <b>and</b> <b>tradition,</b> focusing on participation and transformation as two core characteristics. Finally, the relationship of culture <b>and</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>and</b> religious education is dealt with using a Peircean, abductive line of interpretation as an alternative way of understanding the dynamic relationship of culture <b>and</b> <b>tradition.</b> Copyright © The Religious Education Association...|$|R
