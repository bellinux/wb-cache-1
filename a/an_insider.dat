5|$|From 1994 to 1995 Tomlinson {{worked in}} the {{operational}} counter-proliferation department. His first posting in this capacity was to work as an undercover agent against Iran, where he succeeded in penetrating the Iranian Intelligence Service. He posed as a British businessman, and infiltrated a network of arms dealers that included Nahum Manbar. The British government supplied the Iranians with materials for chemical weapons {{in order to gain}} intelligence on Iran's military programme. Tomlinson's description of his Iranian activities are generally considered to be true, due to his personal involvement and knowledge of details that only <b>an</b> <b>insider</b> would know.|$|E
5|$|The {{check on}} Forbes' {{authority}} at Perryville was Dr. Sawyer, Harding's physician {{and chairman of}} the Federal Hospitalization Board. Sawyer told Harding that Forbes was selling valuable hospital supplies to <b>an</b> <b>insider</b> contractor. At first Harding did not believe it, but Sawyer secured proof in January 1923. A shocked Harding, who alternated between rage and despondency over the corruption in his administration, summoned Forbes to the White House and demanded his resignation. Harding did not want an open scandal and allowed Forbes to flee to Europe, from where he resigned on February 15, 1923. In spite of Harding's efforts, gossip about Forbes' activities resulted in the Senate ordering an investigation two weeks later, and in mid-March, Cramer committed suicide.|$|E

25|$|Conduct by a {{fiduciary}} may {{be deemed}} constructive fraud {{when it is}} based on acts, omissions or concealments considered fraudulent and that gives one an advantage against the other because such conduct—though not actually fraudulent, dishonest or deceitful—demands redress for reasons of public policy.

Breach of fiduciary duty by a lawyer with regard to a client, if negligent, may be a form of legal malpractice; if intentional, it may be remedied in equity.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 March 1995, Aum members {{released}} sarin in a coordinated attack on five trains in the Tokyo subway system, killing 13 commuters, seriously injuring 54 and affecting 980 more. Some estimates claim as many as 6,000 people were injured by the sarin. It is difficult to obtain exact numbers since many victims are reluctant to come forward. Prosecutors allege that Asahara was tipped off about planned police raids on cult facilities by <b>an</b> <b>insider,</b> and ordered an attack in central Tokyo to divert police {{attention away from the}} group. The attack evidently backfired, and police conducted huge simultaneous raids on cult compounds across the country.|$|E
25|$|According to John K.

Moreover, Lê Văn Hưu and Ngô Sĩ Liên belonged to another dynasties, hence they could hardly praise the achievements of a different dynasty with its officials like the Lý Dynasty with its Đỗ Anh Vũ.|$|E

25|$|Insider {{trading is}} the trading of a corporation's stock or other {{securities}} (e.g. bonds or stock options) by individuals with potential access to non-public {{information about the}} company. In most countries, trading by corporate insiders such as officers, key employees, directors, and large shareholders may be legal, if this trading is done {{in a way that}} does not take advantage of non-public information. However, the term is frequently used to refer to a practice in which <b>an</b> <b>insider</b> or a related party trades based on material non-public information obtained during the performance of the insider's duties at the corporation, or otherwise in breach of a fiduciary or other relationship of trust and confidence or where the non-public information was misappropriated from the company. Illegal insider trading is believed to raise the cost of capital for securities issuers, thus decreasing overall economic growth.|$|E
