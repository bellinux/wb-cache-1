5|$|After the {{critical}} and commercial success of Awakening, development began on Fates, {{with the staff}} of Awakening returning to their previous roles. The team's main concern was adding new features and refinements to the original gameplay, and improving the story, which had received criticism from fans. To this end, writer Shin Kibayashi was brought in. To show {{all sides of the}} story and provide players with different Fire Emblem experiences, the game was split up into multiple versions. Upon release, it met with highly positive reviews: Birthright was generally seen as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> place for new players, Conquest was praised for its challenge, while Revelation was noted as a good middle ground between the two releases.|$|E
5|$|When the Germans {{launched}} {{the invasion of}} Crete on 20 May, Kippenberger, {{like most of the}} defenders of the island, was surprised at the sight of hundreds of Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) descending under parachutes. He quickly recovered and was making his way to his headquarters, when a burst of gunfire from a paratrooper was directed his way. After twisting his ankle in avoiding the gunfire, he stalked and killed the paratrooper with a shot to the head. His brigade was positioned east of Maleme airfield, on the Galatas plains. It was well positioned to counterattack scattered paratroopers who were beginning to consolidate into <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> position from which an attack on the airfield could be launched. His request to do so was denied by the acting divisional commander, Brigadier Edward Puttick. An attack launched later without Kippenberger's knowledge failed although he believed the outcome could have been different if his troops had been involved.|$|E

25|$|Molecular {{biology is}} the study of {{molecular}} underpinnings of the process of replication, transcription and translation of the genetic material. The central dogma of molecular biology where genetic material is transcribed into RNA and then translated into protein, despite being an oversimplified picture of molecular biology, still provides <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> point for understanding the field.

25|$|Side reins are {{adjusted}} {{longer for}} less-experienced horses, and gradually shortened, and raised higher (from {{point of shoulder}} {{up to the point}} of hip) as a horse becomes better trained. For green horses, the side reins are adjusted so that the horse can take contact with the bit, but does not have to flex beyond its abilities. <b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> point is to adjust the reins so the green horse carries its head approximately 4inches in front of the vertical. In any case, the head is not to be pulled behind the vertical.|$|E
25|$|Gaining {{popularity}} as a folk {{instrument in}} the early 19th century in the Celtic music revivals, penny whistles now play {{an integral part of}} several folk traditions. Whistles are a prevalent starting instrument in English traditional music, Scottish traditional music and Irish traditional music, since they are often cheap (under US$10), relatively easy to start with (no tricky embouchure such as found with the flute), and the fingerings are nearly identical to those on the traditional six holed flute (Irish flute, baroque flute). The tin whistle is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> instrument to learn the uilleann pipes, which has similar finger technique, range of notes and repertoire. The tin whistle is the most popular instrument in Irish traditional music today.|$|E

Unlike most races during the season, the qualifying session only determined {{the first two}} positions, {{while the rest of}} the drivers qualified by the 2011 Gatorade Duels. Earnhardt clinched his 10th pole position during his career, with a time of 48.364seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Jeff Gordon. Once the qualifying session completed, Earnhardt commented, [...] "The main thing [...] does for me is take the pressure off Thursday's race.

500|$|Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio {{first learned}} of Powers' novel On Stranger Tides during the {{back-to-back}} production of [...] (2006) and , and considered it <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> {{point for a}} new movie in the series. Pre-production started {{after the end of}} the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, with Depp collaborating with the writers on the story design. Principal photography rolled for 106 days between June and November 2010, with locations in Hawaii, the United Kingdom, Puerto Rico and California. Filming employed 3D cameras similar to those used in the production of the 2009 film Avatar, and ten companies were involved with the film's visual effects. Following inflated production costs it is currently noted as the most expensive film ever made with a net budget of $379 million.|$|E
500|$|Flanders {{argues that}} nonhuman animals could be [...] "below" [...] politics, {{in that they}} do not have {{politically}} considerable interests, or [...] "above" [...] politics, in that they have rights which trump political decision-making processes. Flanders argues that if animals are excluded from basic justice, as John Rawls held, they can be defended on metaphysical grounds (what Rawls refers to as on the basis of comprehensive doctrines, as opposed to the public reasons which must be used for arguments in the political realm). This is potentially liberating for animal advocates. Nonetheless, Flanders argues, animal issues may be matters of basic justice insofar as they affect humans or the animals themselves have rights. Alternatively, the wrongness of animal cruelty may be a [...] "fixed point" [...] in our political reasoning. Flanders concludes that Rawlsianism provides <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> point for the inclusion of animals in political decision-making.|$|E

500|$|The Enterprise {{reaches the}} Neutral Zone and {{confirms}} that the outposts have been destroyed. They are soon met by a Romulan Warbird and Commander Tebok (Marc Alaimo) questions why the Enterprise has approached the zone. As Picard tries to explain his actions, Offenhouse arrives on the bridge and threatens to disrupt the tense situation, though he correctly ascertains that the Romulans are also seeking answers. Picard and the Romulans agree to pool their resources to discover the culprit. Picard later comments that while the encounter went favorably, the Romulans may be a significant threat in future engagements. Picard arranges to transport the 20th-Century humans to Earth. [...] Troi locates one of Claire's descendants on Earth, and while Claire is unsure of her place in her new reality, Troi suggests that family is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> point. Clemmons expresses enthusiasm for the future, and Picard sets Offenhouse the challenge of improving himself.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Ryan Geddes {{called it}} [...] "a strong anime-style Japanese RPG", {{generally}} citing {{the game as}} an enjoyable experience. Francesca Reyes, writing for Official Xbox Magazine, found {{some aspects of the}} battle system frustrating, but stated that most other aspects of the game made up for this deficiency. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot was positive overall, despite noting a lack of strategy in a lot of battles and similarity to previous Tales games. Hardcore Gamers Steve Hannley called the game <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> point for the series on then-current consoles. RPGFan's Ashton Liu said that, while it stood as perhaps the best entry in the series, he also noted that it had not evolved very much mechanically when compared to other RPG series. GameSpy's Gabe Graziani cited it as a graphical improvement over other JRPGs on the console, and praised the characters despite citing the story as being conventional, and called it [...] " [...] superior blend of style and production value".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the album}} was mixed, with writers acknowledging the album's uniqueness but questioning its lyrical and musical quality. Sam Davies of The Wire wrote, [...] "There are hits and misses: platitudes and cliches, interspersed with bursts of surreal genius. [...] So much indie hiphop [...] tries to challenge mainstream orthodoxy through a cryptic acceleration of thought and voice [...] but Lil B's slower, more ruminative delivery here feels far braver for being more exposed and vulnerable." [...] A positive review in Vice called Lil B [...] "the most revolutionary MC of the last 15 years," [...] but said Rain in England is not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> point for people new to his music because the album is [...] "a bit too raw for most life forms to process". Rating the album a 6 out of 10, Charles Aaron of Spin said {{the album was}} Lil B's [...] "least accessible" [...] release to date and sounded like [...] "a therapy-session testimony that sounds like Soulja Boy having a Damascus moment in the champagne room over a beatless synth tide." ...|$|E

500|$|Asian {{martial arts}} films began {{appearing}} as imports regularly during the 1970s. These [...] "kung fu" [...] films {{as they were}} often called, whatever martial art they featured, were popularized in the United States by the Hong Kong–produced movies of Bruce Lee and marketed to the same audience targeted by AIP and New World. Horror continued to attract young, independent American directors. As Roger Ebert explained in one 1974 review, [...] "Horror and exploitation films almost always turn a profit if they're brought in at the right price. So they provide <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> place for ambitious would-be filmmakers who can't get more conventional projects off the ground." [...] The movie under consideration was The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Made by Tobe Hooper for less than $300,000, it {{became one of the}} most influential horror films of the 1970s. John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), produced on a $320,000 budget, grossed over [...] worldwide and effectively established the slasher flick as horror's primary mode for the next decade. Just as Hooper had learned from Romero's work, Halloween, in turn, largely followed the model of Black Christmas (1974), directed by Deathdreams Bob Clark.|$|E
500|$|Climax Studios, the {{developer}} of Silent Hill: Origins, developed Shattered Memories with a development team {{made up of}} more than 55 members and a supporting network of more than 90 artists. With the completion of Origins—for which they had attempted to closely replicate the atmosphere and gameplay elements of the first Silent Hill game (1999)—Climax Studios {{wanted to create a}} different horror game. Because of the tenth anniversary of the first Silent Hill installment, Konami thought the time was ideal [...] "to revisit" [...] the game. Climax Studios saw the then-newly introduced Wii platform as a way to reach a wider range of gamers, especially as outside Japan, no Silent Hill title had been exclusively released on a Nintendo platform. Development costs for the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 and their gamers' [...] "mindset" [...] factored into the decision for the gaming platform. Additionally, {{the developer}}s wanted to use the Wii Remote to incorporate the gameplay elements of the flashlight and radio static. Climax felt that the first game would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> point, instead of continuing any existing storylines or adding onto the mythology of the town. To please fans of the series and bring in new ones, they decided to reimagine the setting and characters, such as Dahlia, who was changed from [...] "a haggard old woman" [...] who led the town's cult into a physically attractive young woman.|$|E
500|$|The Litigators {{is said to}} be [...] "an amusing and appalling {{look into}} the machinations of a {{nationwide}} class-action suit," [...] according to Tobin Harshaw of Bloomberg L.P. [...] The Wall Street Journals Christopher John Farley noted that the book is lighter than Grisham's other works. Publishers Weekly called it a [...] "bitingly farcical look at lawyers {{at the bottom of the}} food chain". CNN described the book as an original perspective of [...] "the best and worst the American system of justice has to offer". Louis Bayard of The Washington Post, who described himself as someone who abandoned Grisham after his first three novels, noted that this book might be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> point for those who have tired of Grisham. [...] Andrea Simakis of The Plain Dealer describes the book as a [...] "heartier meal" [...] than Grisham's usual [...] "potato-chip fiction". Publishers Weekly also notes that the fairy tale ending is not really in keeping with the introduction's dark humor. Rick Arthur of The United Arab Emirates publication The National describes the book unfavorably as a cross between prior Grisham works The Street Lawyer and The King of Torts and similarly describes the protagonist unfavorably to those of The Firm and The Rainmaker. Geoffrey Wansell of the Daily Mail presented one of the more favorable reviews describing the book as [...] "a spectacular return to form, displaying the clarity and passion that were there in his first thrillers but seemed to ebb away." [...] Wansell notes that Grisham returned to one of his seminal themes of the idealistic young lawyer fighting with the realization that corporations only care about maximizing profits.|$|E
