25|$|The Allo-Inclusive Scale {{is adapted}} from the Inclusion of Others in the Self (IOS) Scale by Aron et al. (1992). The Allo-Inclusive Scale {{contains}} seven pairs of Venn diagrams that range in how far apart the circles are. In the first pair, there is no overlap but as {{you get to the}} second, or third pair, the circles begin to overlap more and more. In the last pair (the seventh pair) the circles completely overlap. Participants respond to eight items by choosing the pair of circles that best denotes their connection with that particular item. A sample item is “The connection between you and a wild animal (such as a squirrel, deer, or wolf).” There are also eight other items to this scale that assess how connected participants feel to people. This scale shows <b>acceptable</b> <b>reliability</b> (Cronbach's α = 0.75) and validity (correlations with concern for environment). This scale is not contaminated with social desirability biases. The NR scale, the Allo-Inclusive scale, and the CN scale are highly correlated with one another suggesting they {{are all part of the}} nature connectedness construct.|$|E
2500|$|The Connectedness to Nature Scale (CNS). This scale {{measures}} how emotionally {{connected people}} feel {{to the natural}} world, animals, and plants. It also assesses people's perceived equality between nature and themselves. An example of an item is [...] "I recognize and appreciate the intelligence of other living organisms." [...] These items are rated on a Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) where higher scores demonstrate a higher connection to nature. This scale can be used both at the trait and state level. The state version is 13-items and shows <b>acceptable</b> <b>reliability</b> (α = [...]91,). The trait version is 14-items and also demonstrates good reliability (α = [...]82). This scale's validity is demonstrated by its positive associations with other environmental scales (such as the New Ecological Paradigm Scale) but is not associated with verbal ability or social desirability. See also Connectedness to nature scale.|$|E

5000|$|Because the NPI was {{originally}} based on DSM criteria for NPD, {{there has been}} much research on its factor structure. Raskin and Terry (1988) identified seven factors of the NPI (i.e., authority, superiority, exhibitionism, entitlement, vanity, [...] and self-sufficiency), mapping roughly onto the DSM criteria for NPD. Since then, several studies have further examined the factor structure of the NPI with varying results. For example, some studies report three factors; some report four factors. It is also often the case that factors of the NPI exhibit very low internal consistency (although the full scale exhibits <b>acceptable</b> <b>reliability).</b> A 2015 study attempted to measure narcissism with a single item. Compared to the NPI, one advantage of the single-item measure {{is that it does not}} seem to conflate narcissism with normal, or healthy, self-esteem.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{aspect of}} allocentrism is the {{priority}} of in-group goals over personal goals and this can be measured using the Collectivism Scale [...] or scales that look at interdependence versus independence. Triandis et al., 1995 Allocentrism has been measured utilizing The Collectivism Scale in three cultures—Korean, Japanese, and American—and found to have good concurrent and criterion validity and <b>acceptable</b> <b>reliability</b> (Cronbach’s Alpha [...]77-.88). It is a ten item, five point Likert scale that assesses how much an individual acts {{in his or her}} own self-interest versus his or her group’s interest. The group can be defined in various ways such as one’s family, peer group, or work group. Allocentrism is a very broad construct and therefore cannot be measured using only a few items; therefore, it is suggested that it be measured with multi-methods due to the limitations of each method ...|$|E
50|$|By luck (and {{pressure}} by Ernst Udet), RLM reconsidered {{the ideas of}} the Kampfzerstörer and began focusing on the Zerstörer. Due to these changes, the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke design better fitted RLM's requests. On 12 May 1936, Rudolf Opitz flew the first Bf 110 out of Augsburg. But, as many pre-war designs found, the engine technologies promised were not up to <b>acceptable</b> <b>reliability</b> standards. Even with the temperamental DB 600 engines, the RLM found the Bf 110, while not as maneuverable as desired, was quite a bit faster than its original request specified, as well as faster than the then-current front line fighter, the Bf 109 B-1. Thus the order for four pre-production A-0 units was placed. The first of these were delivered on January 1937. During this testing, both the Focke-Wulf Fw 187 and Henschel Hs 124 competitors were rejected and the Bf 110 was ordered into full production.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop an {{instrument}} to measure healthcare professionals’ knowledge and attitudes about near-death experiences (NDEs) that would demonstrate acceptable psychometric properties. In consultation with a focus group of six NDE experts, I developed the 50 -item Knowledge and Attitudes toward Near-Death Experiences Scale (KANDES), including the 24 -item KANDES–Attitude subscale (KANDES-A) and the 26 -item KANDES–Knowledge subscale (KANDES-K). Including a pilot administration in which feedback indicated no need for revision, a total of 256 professional and student counselors completed the KANDES. Separate reliability and validity analyses were conducted for each subscale. For the KANDES–A, Cronbach’s alpha was. 909, and Pearson’s r for test-retest was. 748, both indicating <b>acceptable</b> <b>reliability.</b> An exploratory factor analysis indicated four factors to retain and yielded a factor solution that explained 54. 87 % of the variance, an acceptable amount of variance to substantiate construct validity.

Confirmatory factor analysis established the three-factor structure of the goals measure. All scales had <b>acceptable</b> <b>reliabilities.</b> job satisfaction was positively related to mastery goals, unrelated to performance approach goals, and negatively related to performance avoidance goals.

40|$|ABSTRACT. In this study, the {{reservoir}} operating rules for satisfying reliable water releases under uncertain inflows and water de-mands were developed.

The reservoir inflows and water demands in different operating sea-sons were of normal distribution with known means and variances. The minimum cost of water releases from {{the reservoir}} was achieved by keeping minimum storage, maintaining sufficient flood and drought control capacities, achieving water demands of users, and satisfying releases to downstream channel with <b>acceptable</b> <b>reliabilities.</b> The complex interrelationships among water releases, ini-tial reservoir storage, and reliability level were revealed through the developed model.

40|$|Objective: Aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} test-retest reliability of the Isernhagen Work System Functional Capacity Evaluation (IWS FCE) in healthy subjects. Design: Test-retest reliability was studied of 28 IWS FCE tests. Two FCE sessions were held within a 2 to 3 week interval. Descriptives per session, Intra Class Correlation (ICC), limits of agreement, Cohen’s Kappa and percentage of agreement were calculated where appropriate. An ICC of ≥ 0. 75, a Kappa value ≥ 0. 60 and a percentage of absolute agreement of ≥ 80 % were considered <b>acceptable</b> <b>reliability.</b> Subjects: A convenience sample of 26 healthy subjects participated in the study. The subjects ’ mean age was 34. 9 years. Results: <b>Acceptable</b> <b>reliability</b> was demonstrated for 7 out of 9 tests (78 %) of the material handling group and the shuttle walk test based on ICC analyses only. Sixteen out of 17 criterion and ceiling tests (94 %) showed <b>acceptable</b> <b>reliability</b> based on Kappa values and percentage of agreement. Of these 17 tests, 8 were eligible for further analysis, and of those 8 tests the reliability of one test was acceptable based on ICC analyses (13 %).
