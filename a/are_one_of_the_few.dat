5|$|Figs {{flower and}} fruit asynchronously. Flowering and fruiting is {{staggered}} throughout the population. This fact {{is important for}} fig wasps—female wasps {{need to find a}} syconium in which to lay their eggs within a few days of emergence, something that would not be possible if all the trees in a population flowered and fruited at the same time. This also makes figs important food resources for frugivores (animals that feed nearly exclusively on fruit); figs <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> fruit available at times of the year when fruit are scarce.|$|E

5|$|Adam Berry, the show's {{original}} score composer, used {{sound synthesis}} to simulate a small orchestra, and frequently alluded to existing famous pieces of music. Berry also used signature acoustic guitar and mandolin cues as leitmotifs for the show's establishing shots. After Berry left in 2001, Jamie Dunlap and Scott Nickoley of the Los Angeles-based Mad City Production Studios provided the show's original {{music for the}} next seven seasons. Since 2008, Dunlap has been credited as the show's sole score composer. Dunlap's contributions to the show <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> that are not achieved at the show's own production offices.

5|$|Agouti species <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> animal {{groups that}} can break open the large {{capsules}} of the Brazil nut fruit. Too many seeds are inside {{to be consumed}} in one meal, so the agouti carries some off and caches them. This helps dispersal of the seeds as any that the agouti fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate. Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear a glut of fruits in the autumn. These are too numerous to be eaten in one meal and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices and hollow trees. In desert regions, seeds are often available only for short periods. The kangaroo rat collects all it can find and stores them in larder chambers in its burrow.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, Ocean Software ported {{the game}} to home gaming systems, {{including}} the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. Due to the hardware limitations of the various systems, the graphics and sounds of the ports differ from the original arcade version. Some home versions use a light gun peripheral to simulate the control scheme of the arcade format. The Sega Master System port uses the Sega Light Phaser accessory. The Amiga and Atari ST versions <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> games to use the Trojan Light Gun. In developing the Amiga conversion, the team video taped the arcade machine in operation as a reference for the graphics, pausing the video at relevant spots to take notes before recreating them. Programmer Damien Stones spent four months on the ZX Spectrum version. He kept the graphical detail of the backgrounds simple to allow for more action in the foreground. Taking into account the system's lower capabilities compared to the arcade hardware, Stones designed {{the game to}} handle {{a large number of}} on-screen sprites. In 2005, Space Gun was included in the compilation title Taito Legends for the PlayStation 2, personal computer and Xbox.|$|E
5|$|Kronprinz Wilhelm {{was never}} raised for scrapping, {{unlike most of}} the other capital ships that were scuttled. Kronprinz Wilhelm and two of her sisters had sunk in deeper water than the other capital ships, which made a salvage attempt more difficult. The {{outbreak}} of World War II in 1939 put a halt to all salvage operations, and after the war it was determined that salvaging the deeper wrecks was financially impractical. The rights to future salvage operations on the wreck were sold to Britain in 1962. The depth in which the three battleships sank insulated them from the radiation released by the use of atomic weapons. As a result, Kronprinz Wilhelm and her sisters <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> remaining sources of radiation-free steel. The ships have occasionally had steel removed for use in scientific devices. Kronprinz Wilhelm and the other vessels on the bottom of Scapa Flow are a popular dive site, and are protected by a policy barring divers from recovering items from the wrecks. In 2017, marine archaeologists from the Orkney Research Center for Archaeology conducted extensive surveys of Kronprinz Wilhelm and nine other wrecks in the area, including six other German and three British warships. The archaeologists mapped the wrecks with sonar and examined them with remotely operated underwater vehicles {{as part of an effort}} to determine how the wrecks are deteriorating.|$|E

5|$|Polled Dorsets are a {{medium-sized}} sheep that are long lived and prolific, heavy milkers. They produce hardy lambs with moderate growth and maturity that yield heavily muscled carcasses. Their fleece is very white, strong, close, free from dark fiber and extends down the legs. When shorn, fleece averages {{between five and}} nine pounds (2.23 to 4kg) in ewes and fifty to seventy percent of their fleece can be used. The staple length ranges from 2.5 to 4 inches (6 to 10cm) with a numeric count of 46's-58's. The fiber diameter ranges from 27.0 to 33.0 microns. At maturity, ewes weigh between 150 and 200 pounds (67 to 91kg), some weighing more in show condition. Mature rams range in weight from 225 to 275 pounds (102 to 125kg). Dorsets are noted {{for their ability to}} be bred more than once per year and are commonly used in crossbreeding to produce females for out-of-season breeding. They <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> breeds that have this characteristic. Multiple births are common and they work well in commercial operations, including programs where rams are specifically used to sire lambs for slaughter. These rams are known as terminal sires since their genetics are more suitable for slaughter than breeding purposes.|$|E
5|$|The Antankarana {{split off}} from the Sakalava in the early 17th century {{following}} a succession dispute. The group settled at {{the northern end of}} the island where they established sovereignty over and integrated the existing communities. During periods of conflict with Sakalava in the 17th century and the Kingdom of Imerina in the 19th century, the community periodically sought refuge in the natural stone shelters and caves of the modern Ankarana Reserve, eventually taking their name from the locale and holding it as sacred. In the early 19th century an Antankarana king signed a treaty with French envoys in Reunion that mobilized French troops to expel the Merina from Antankarana territory in exchange for French control over several small islands off Madagascar's west coast. They also aided the French in staging attacks on the Merina monarchy that resulted in the 1896 French colonization of Madagascar. The Antankarana <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> communities that continues to honor a single king and reaffirm his sacred ancestral role through traditional ceremonies that date back centuries.|$|E
5|$|The main {{veins and}} the crossveins form the wing venation pattern. The venation {{patterns}} {{are different in}} different species. There may be very numerous crossveins or rather few. The Australian Flatwing Damselfly's wings <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> veins patterns. The venation pattern is useful for species identification. Almost all Anisoptera settle with the wings held out sideways or slightly downward, however most Zygoptera settle with the wings held together, dorsal surfaces apposed. The thorax of Zygoptera is so oblique that when held {{in this way the}} wings fit neatly {{along the top of the}} abdomen. They do not appear to be held straight up as in butterflies or mayflies. In a few zygopteran families the wings are held horizontally at rest, and in one anisopteran genus (e.g. Cordulephya, Corduliidae) the wings are held in the typical damselfly resting position. Adult species possess two pairs of equal or subequal wings. There appear to be only five main vein stems. A nodus is formed where the second main vein (subcosta) meets the leading edge of the wing. In most families a conspicuous pterostigma is carried near the wing tip. Identification as Odonata can be based on the venation. The only likely confusion is with some lacewings (order Neuroptera) which have many crossveins in the wings. Until the early years of the 20th century Odonata were often regarded as being related to lacewings and were given the ordinal name Paraneuroptera, but any resemblance between these two orders is entirely superficial. In Anisoptera the hindwing is broader than the forewing and in both wings a crossvein divides the discoidal cell into a Triangle and Supertriangle.|$|E
