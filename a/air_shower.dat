25|$|When {{cosmic rays}} enter the Earth's {{atmosphere}} they collide with atoms and molecules, mainly oxygen and nitrogen. The interaction produces {{a cascade of}} lighter particles, a so-called <b>air</b> <b>shower</b> secondary radiation that rains down, including x-rays, muons, protons, alpha particles, pions, electrons, and neutrons.

40|$|In the {{basement}} of the central detector of KASCADE 32 large position sensitive multiwire proportional chambers (MWPC) are used to measure the muon component of extensive <b>air</b> <b>showers.</b> The MWPCs are installed and the operation parameters are optimized in extended test measurements. Some 168 000 measured <b>air</b> <b>showers</b> are analyzed in respect to an average and a local particle density. An analyzing algorithm is developed and tested for the case of high particle densities (> 2 /m" 2) inside the muon chambers. The lateral decrease of the particle density in high energy <b>air</b> <b>showers</b> can be seen. For reconstructing the real muon numbers, the measured particle density have to be corrected with the distance of the shower core. Using the integral primary cosmic flux spectrum, a minimum energy for the primary particle of the detected <b>air</b> <b>showers</b> is estimated. The effect of the chemical composition and the primary spectrum in analyzing <b>air</b> <b>showers</b> with high particle densities is examined by the use of CORSIKA simulated <b>air</b> <b>showers.</b> (orig.)

25|$|When a high-energy (TeV) gamma photon or cosmic ray {{interacts with}} the Earth's atmosphere, it may produce an electron-positron pair with {{enormous}} velocities. The Cherenkov radiation emitted in the atmosphere by these charged particles is {{used to determine the}} direction and energy of the cosmic ray or gamma ray, which is used for example in the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Technique (IACT), by experiments such as VERITAS, H.E.S.S., MAGIC. Cherenkov radiation emitted in tanks filled with water by those charged particles reaching earth is used for the same goal by the Extensive <b>Air</b> <b>Shower</b> experiment HAWC, the Pierre Auger Observatory and other projects. Similar methods are used in very large neutrino detectors, such as the Super-Kamiokande, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) and IceCube. Other projects operated in the past applying related techniques, such as STACEE, a former solar tower refurbished to work as a non-imaging Cherenkov observatory, which was located in New Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The Earth and {{all living}} things on it are {{constantly}} bombarded by radiation from outer space. This radiation primarily consists of positively charged ions from protons to iron and larger nuclei derived sources outside our solar system. This radiation interacts with atoms in the atmosphere to create an <b>air</b> <b>shower</b> of secondary radiation, including X-rays, muons, protons, alpha particles, pions, electrons, and neutrons. The immediate dose from cosmic radiation is largely from muons, neutrons, and electrons, and this dose varies {{in different parts of}} the world based largely on the geomagnetic field and altitude. For example, the city of Denver in the United States (at 1650 meters elevation) receives a cosmic ray dose roughly twice that of a location at sea level. This radiation is much more intense in the upper troposphere, around 10km altitude, and is thus of particular concern for airline crews and frequent passengers, who spend many hours per year in this environment. During their flights airline crews typically get an extra dose on the order of 2.2mSv (220 mrem) per year.|$|E
25|$|Measurements of {{the energy}} and arrival {{directions}} of the ultra-high energy primary cosmic rays by the techniques of density sampling and fast timing of extensive air showers were first carried out in 1954 {{by members of the}} Rossi Cosmic Ray Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The experiment employed eleven scintillation detectors arranged within a circle 460 meters in diameter {{on the grounds of the}} Agassiz Station of the Harvard College Observatory. From that work, and from many other experiments carried out all over the world, the energy spectrum of the primary cosmic rays is now known to extend beyond 1020eV. A huge <b>air</b> <b>shower</b> experiment called the Auger Project is currently operated at a site on the pampas of Argentina by an international consortium of physicists, led by James Cronin, winner of the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics from the University of Chicago, and Alan Watson of the University of Leeds. Their aim is to explore the properties and arrival directions of the very highest-energy primary cosmic rays. The results are expected to have important implications for particle physics and cosmology, due to a theoretical Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit to the energies of cosmic rays from long distances (about 160 million light years) which occurs above 1020eV because of interactions with the remnant photons from the Big Bang origin of the universe.|$|E
