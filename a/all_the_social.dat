5|$|Duhalde was {{succeeded by}} Néstor Kirchner on May 25, 2003. Kirchner soon {{distanced himself from}} Duhalde, and removed all the people close to Duhalde from the {{government}} to reduce his political influence. Kirchner also sought supporters from <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> and political spectra to counter the influence of Duhalde within the party. However, both men delayed an open dispute and stuck together during the 2003 legislative elections, held in October. The dispute continued in the 2005 midterm elections. Without consensus in the PJ for a single candidate for senator of the Buenos Aires province, both leaders had their respective wives run for the office: Hilda González de Duhalde for the PJ, and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner for the Front for Victory, which was kept by the Kirchners. Cristina Kirchner won those elections.|$|E
5|$|In May 1966, Imelda {{pushed through}} with campaigning for social welfare. Her {{plan was to}} pool {{together}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> welfare efforts of several dozen social welfare groups. Imelda wanted to build welfare villages {{to meet the needs}} of children with problems, and reorient a personnel to staff the villages. The scheme called for 12 million pesos. In November 1966, the cornerstone for the Reception and Study Center in Quezon City was laid. Until 1968, other villages were built: Marilla Hills in Alabang, the Children's Orphanage in Pasay City, the Molave Village in Tanay, a Home for the Aged in Quezon City, and the Philippine Village at the Manila International Airport.|$|E

Little Rascals was one of the pieces which absorbed <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> changes.|$|E

Because of their {{attempts}} to free Maximilian, the prince was again accepted at court along with his wife. In Europe she was the star of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> circles in the capital {{as well as in}} Karlsruhe where she lived. During the war she continued to travel along with her husband and served among the medical staff. She was awarded the Cross of Merit for Women and Girls for army relief work.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only were}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> {{institutions}} of Turkish society reorganized, but {{the social and}} political values of the state were replaced as well. This new, secular state ideology was to become known as Kemalism, and it is the basis of the democratic Turkish republic. Since the establishment of the republic the Turkish military has perceived itself as the guardian of Kemalism, and it has intervened in Turkish politics to that end on several occasions, including the overthrow of civilian governments by coup d'état. While this may seem contrary to democratic ideals, it was argued by military authorities and secularists as necessary in the light of Turkish history, ongoing efforts to maintain secular government, {{and the fact that the}} reforms were implemented at a time when the military occupied 16.9% of the professional job positions (the corresponding figure today is only 3%).|$|E
25|$|Agnes, on {{the other}} hand, has a preprogrammed script in her head that {{contains}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> rules of conduct. She is easily embarrassed and uses most of her energies attempting to keep others from saying or doing things that go against her rules. In other words, she escapes the nasty or difficult parts of life by defining them as taboo subjects. Agnes hides from reality behind the rules. If the rules do not offer shelter, she then escapes reality through pure avoidance. She {{does not want to}} talk about things that are unpleasant, unless, of course, she is discussing her sister’s poor excuse for a life. She avoids her daughter’s temper tantrum, assuming that her daughter will eventually work things out on her own. Agnes, in the meantime, does not have time to deal with all those emotions. Even though she suspects that her husband had an affair, she only asks the people whom she knows will not confirm her suspicions.|$|E

500|$|Patriarchy is {{a social}} system in which society is {{organized}} around male authority figures. In this system fathers have authority over women, children, and property. It implies the institutions of male rule and privilege, and is dependent on female subordination. Most forms of feminism characterize patriarchy as an unjust social system that is oppressive to women. Carole Pateman argues that the patriarchal distinction [...] "between masculinity and femininity is the political difference between freedom and subjection." [...] In feminist theory the concept of patriarchy often includes <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> mechanisms that reproduce and exert male dominance over women. Feminist theory typically characterizes patriarchy as a social construction, which can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations. [...] Some radical feminists have proposed that because patriarchy is too deeply rooted in society, separatism is the only viable solution. Other feminists have criticized these views as being anti-men.|$|E
500|$|Irving Louis Horowitz, in his The Decomposition of Sociology (1994), {{has argued}} that the discipline, while {{arriving}} from a [...] "distinguished lineage and tradition", is in decline due to deeply ideological theory and a lack of relevance to policy making: [...] "The decomposition of sociology began when this great tradition became subject to ideological thinking, and an inferior tradition surfaced in the wake of totalitarian triumphs." [...] Furthermore: [...] "A problem yet unmentioned is that sociology's malaise has left <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> sciences vulnerable to pure positivism—to an empiricism lacking any theoretical basis. Talented individuals who might, in an earlier time, have gone into sociology are seeking intellectual stimulation in business, law, the natural sciences, and even creative writing; this drains sociology of much needed potential." [...] Horowitz cites the lack of a 'core discipline' as exacerbating the problem. Randall Collins, the Dorothy Swaine Thomas Professor in Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania {{and a member of the}} Advisory Editors Council of the Social Evolution & History journal, has voiced similar sentiments: [...] "we have lost all coherence as a discipline, we are breaking up into a conglomerate of specialities, each going on its own way and with none too high regard for each other." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Metamorphosis" [...] chronicles Machin's narrow {{survival}} {{of an explosion}} {{and use of the}} confusion in its aftermath to fake his death. Several months later, he is now stated to be fifteen-years old and has begun a new plan to liberate the world of government. As Anarky, he attempts to create a device which will emit beams of light on frequencies which will trigger the human brain of all who see it. The people will then be [...] "de-brainwashed" [...] of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> constraints which society has placed on the individual. Utilizing a makeshift teleportation device capable of summoning a boom tube, he begins a quest to capture the power sources his invention will need: the madness of Etrigan, the evil of Darkseid, and the goodness of Batman. Desiring to tempt Batman into confronting him, Anarky successfully lures Batman's attention by hiring Legs and other homeless men to monitor Batman's movements. During the confrontation between Anarky and Batman, the device is damaged. Thus, when Machin activates it, it only affects himself. The vision that follows reveals what may have happened if he had succeeded, with nightmarish consequences. In the hallucination, the slightest infraction against a smooth-running society is met with banishment to a prison-city. The effects of his machine eventually wear off, and the most dangerous elements of the prison escape, causing havoc. The conclusion Anarky draws from this is that if society is to change, individuals must accept that change voluntarily. [...] When Batman turns off the machine, Anarky awakens and promptly escapes, vowing to continue his mission, [...] "until they all learn to choose for themselves..." ...|$|E
