500|$|Large {{quantities}} of <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> were melted in the 1930s {{by the government}} after they were called in under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Although many of the <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> exported in bulk in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were melted—records show that most sent to the United Kingdom were recoined into sovereigns—millions remained in banks. Large {{quantities of}} <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> {{were found in the}} vaults of European banks beginning in the 1940s, and were placed on the numismatic market. Many common and low-grade Liberty Head <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> have been sold as investments, valued based on their bullion content. Type I <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> have been recovered from shipwrecks, bringing many high-grade early specimens onto the market, with the romance of [...] "treasure coins" [...] increasing the public demand.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, Steve Brodie hit {{the first}} <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> in any Ben Hogan Tour event, {{which was also}} the only <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> on that Tour that year. In 1992, the winner earned $25,000.|$|R
25|$|Until {{the early}} 1970s (when President Nixon took the United States off the gold {{standard}} and President Ford signed legislation that again made it legal {{for the public to}} own gold bullion), any recovered 1933 <b>double</b> <b>eagle,</b> as gold bullion, was required to be melted. Therefore, while <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> recovered prior to 1974 were melted down, any <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> recovered now can be spared this fate. Currently, {{with the exception of the}} one sold on July 30, 2002, 1933 <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> coins cannot be the legal possession of any member of the public, as they were never issued and hence remain the property of the United States government.|$|R
500|$|The <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> {{soon became}} the most popular gold coin {{in terms of the}} number of pieces struck.

Of all gold coins struck from the start of gold coinage for circulation in 1795 to the end in 1933, just under half of the coins struck were <b>double</b> <b>eagles,</b> but 78% of the gold used was struck into twenty-dollar pieces. According to Bowers, the <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> [...] "represented the most efficient way to coin a given quantity of gold bullion into coin form".|$|R

50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>Eagle</b> was {{designed}} by Ed Yost and had a 101,000 cubic foot (2,860 cubic meter) envelope. Abruzzo and Anderson rode in an insulated open gondola measuring 6 by 6.5 feet (1.8 by 2 meters) which was later reused for <b>Double</b> <b>Eagle</b> II.|$|R
50|$|The Liberty Head <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> or Coronet <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> is an <b>American</b> twenty-dollar gold piece struck as {{a pattern}} coin in 1849, and for {{commerce}} from 1850 to 1907. It {{was designed by}} Mint of the United States Chief Engraver James B. Longacre.|$|R
50|$|Abruzzo {{was also}} on the <b>Double</b> <b>Eagle</b> V team. The <b>Double</b> <b>Eagle</b> V was {{the first team to}} cross the Pacific Ocean in a gas balloon in November 1981. This flight also set a record for longest trip by a team in a balloon.|$|R

25|$|Coin {{experts in}} the numismatic world have {{advanced}} an argument that Switt could have legally obtained the 1933 coins when he was exchanging gold bullion for coins. Although the Mint records clearly show that no 1933 <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> were issued, there were allegedly three weeks in March 1933 when new <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> could possibly have been legally obtained. The mint began striking <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> on March 15, and Roosevelt's executive order to ban them was not finalized until April 5. On March 6, 1933, the Secretary of the Treasury ordered the Director of the Mint to pay gold only under license issued by the Secretary, and the United States Mint cashier's daily statements do not reflect that any 1933 <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> were paid out.|$|R
500|$|There {{are many}} ways to collect Liberty Head <b>double</b> <b>eagles.</b> [...] Some, wishing only a few pieces, may choose one each of the three major types, or seek pieces from the five mints that struck them. Carson City <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> are highly popular. [...] As the 1870-CC is almost unobtainable, {{collectors}} may limit themselves to Carson City Type III pieces (1877–1893). [...] Collectors seeking one <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> per year of mintage will find it expensive to fill the 1886 entry, a year in which <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> were only struck at Philadelphia, and just 1,000 business strikes and 106 proof pieces were issued. The 2015 edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the 1886 in Very Fine condition (VF-20) at $22,500.|$|R

50|$|Though {{it was in}} {{a losing}} effort, Lowery played a memorable stretch of golf at The International in 2002. He holed out a shot from over 200 yards for a rare <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> (or albatross) on the 71st hole to pull within one point, {{ultimately}} losing by the same margin after missing a birdie putt on the last hole. Coming near {{the very end of the}} tournament and creating such a close finish, Lowery's <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> was one of the most dramatic in PGA Tour history since Gene Sarazen made a <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> at 15 in the final round of the 1935 Masters Tournament. Two holes before his <b>double</b> <b>eagle,</b> Lowery also holed out a wedge from the fairway for an eagle.|$|R

50|$|On August 11, 1978, the <b>Double</b> <b>Eagle</b> II was {{launched}} from a Presque Isle field carrying three passengers. It {{made the first}} successful transatlantic balloon crossing. In honor of the <b>Double</b> <b>Eagle</b> II, the city holds an annual celebration called The Crown of Maine Balloon Festival. The popular event includes balloon rides, plane tours, amateur photo contests and children’s fair rides. Sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce and other local organizations, it is held in late August. The field from which the <b>Double</b> <b>Eagle</b> II lifted off now features a commemorative model balloon.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2002, a 1933 <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> was {{auctioned}} off for US$7,590,020 which shattered the old record of $4,140,000 paid at a public auction for an 1804 silver dollar. This piece is unique as the only 1933 <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> the U.S. government has deemed legal for its citizens to own (having been negotiated as such through terms of a U.S. treaty with a foreign government). [...] Even illegal instances of the 1933 <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> could be worth {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars, but it would be illegal for a U.S. coin dealer to broker a deal with one of these coins. There is no other date of St.-Gaudens <b>double</b> <b>eagle</b> that is worth a significant fraction of this extraordinary coin. A complete uncirculated set of all other St.-Gaudens <b>double</b> <b>eagles</b> could be put together for just over three million dollars (less than half the price paid for the 1933), including the extremely rare, ultra-high relief, proof pattern. Without the rare pattern, the set would be less than $750,000.|$|R
