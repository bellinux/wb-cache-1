40|$|The {{principles}} and practices for forest harvesting in Indonesia (2000) {{have been developed}} to provide a uniform set of minimum standards for logging practices in the production and limited production forests in Indonesia. The provide the standard for WHAT is involved in planning and implementing logging activities in natural forest and WHY certain operations should be undertaken. The Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) guidelines for Indonesia provides the mechanism for HOW the standards will be applied in the field or "how to do the work". Tractor skidding [...] mostly by crawlers and skidders [...] is the most common system (ca. 90 %) used in the Indonesian Selective Cutting and Planting (TPTI) System. Considering the fact that familiarity with more environmentally friendly logging system (such as cable and <b>aerial</b> <b>logging)</b> is still lacking in Indonesia, often due to cost, etc., RIL guidelines focus on ground-based harvesting which can be implemented in the lowland and hill forests in Indonesia. Target groups of this guidelines are production supervisors, RIL planners, bolck inspectors, road network planners, road construction supervisors, machine operators, chainsaw operators, tractor operators and their assistants...|$|E

50|$|Spear {{conducted}} antisubmarine patrols off Ulithi {{during the}} first three weeks of December 1944; escorted a convoy to Hollandia; and then resumed her ASW duties off Ulithi until mid-March 1945. On the 19th, she sortied with Task Group (TG) 52.14, Minesweeper Group 1 of the Amphibious Support Force, for the Okinawa assault. On the night of 26 March, Spear rescued several downed fliers. During the campaign, the minesweeper protected anchorages from enemy submarines and swept enemy mines. In 82 days of uninterrupted operations off Okinawa, Spear was under almost daily <b>aerial</b> attack, <b>logging</b> 202 attacks by enemy planes in April. Spear steamed to Guam in June for tender availability and, six weeks later, was back at Okinawa when hostilities with Japan ended.|$|R
40|$|Datasets grow in size as {{they are}} {{increasingly}} being gathered by cheap and numerous information-sensing mobile devices, <b>aerial,</b> software <b>logs,</b> microphones, wireless sensor networks and cameras. This paper presents a structure for simply, easily and competently parallelizing data mining algorithms for those huge datasets together with the incremental mining. MapReduce concept is use to execute the parallel FP-Growth algorithm by running the windows services parallel. The proposed algorithm eliminates duplicated work and spurious items. Also, it shortens the response time to a query for the set of frequent items. The proposed algorithm is implemented by parallel running of many windows services and experimental results shows tremendous advantages. The proposed algorithm runs 66 % faster than the traditional algorithm of data mining. Also, memory utilization reduces by 37 %...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Cable logging {{systems are}} being applied {{frequently}} in thinning young-growth forests, but {{the dynamics of}} these systems are relatively unknown. This study {{is part of a}} research project to develop <b>aerial</b> <b>logging</b> systems for thinning and to analyze them for economic, silvicultural, and environmental implications. The objectives of my study were: 1) To measure the influence of thinning intensity, slope steepness, load size, skyline distance, lateral rigging distance, and number of workers on yarding times. 2) To develop a model to simulate these relationships under varying working conditions of the skyline system and to identify proposals for improved logging methods. I observed a cable-thinning operation on a 35 - 40 year old Douglas-fir stand on gentle and medium steep slopes. Three thinning intensities of 70, 50, and 20 percent, respectively, were applied. The skyline yarding work cycle was separated into six regular and three irregular e 1 ennts. I used the multimoment time study method to observe these elements and obtained values for the variables that influenced these elements. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyze the effect of these variables on tine required to finish an element. I developed regressions for four regular elements, carriage out, lateral out, lateral in, carriage in, and for total regular yarding tine. Regressions with the observed variables did not produce adequate results for other elements. I analyzed only their frequency distribution. I tested the results of the analysis against a sample from the same yarding system in a different operation. Close correspondence in a chi-square and t-test, respectively, suggests the reliability of the regressions. Several suggestions were made for modifications that may improve the skyline system. They concern hooking and unhooking, the cable configuration, and lateral yarding. I developed a simulation model in the GPSS-computer language to simulate skyline thinning. The elements of the model can be modified to adjust to distinctive situations. I tested the influence of lateral yarding distance on total yarding time and simulated a regular approach with limited lateral yarding distance and a "line thinning" method...|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after graduating}} from high school in 1965, Bonin became engaged to marry; this {{engagement}} had largely been at the behest of his mother, who believed the prospect of marriage would quell her son's evident sexual preference for males. The same year of his graduation, Bonin joined the U.S. Air Force. He later served five months of active duty in the Vietnam War as an <b>aerial</b> gunner, <b>logging</b> over 700 hours of combat and patrol time. Bonin was to later claim his experiences in Vietnam had installed a belief within him that human life is overvalued. On one occasion, while under enemy fire, he risked his own life to save the life of a wounded fellow airman. For this act, Bonin received a Good Conduct Medal in recognition of his gallantry. Bonin later claimed to have engaged in consensual sexual relations with both males and females in Vietnam; he also later admitted to sexually assaulting two fellow soldiers at gunpoint during the period of the Tet Offensive.|$|R

50|$|By 1907 {{the line}} was 6½ miles long, and the mill had an annual output of 2.5M superfeet (~5,900 cubic meteres) of timber, and in 1909 9,200 tons of logs were hauled on the line, {{increasing}} to 15,000 tons in 1915, by which time the line has reached its maximum length of 16½ miles, plus the 2½ mile (~4 km) Flying Fox Creek branch and the 1¼ mile (~2 km) Prices Creek branch, built {{at a cost of}} £26,000. Bridges on the line were up to 40' (~13m) high and 150' (~50m) long, and there were sidings at Witheren, 3m (~5 km) from Canungra, Ferny Glen Junction (6m/~10 km), Prices Creek Junction (7m/~12 km) and Little Flying Fox Junction on the Flying Fox Creek branch, where an <b>aerial</b> cableway lowered <b>logs</b> 1000' (~300m) from an adjacent spur.|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} questionnaire study summarizes {{an evaluation}} of approaches, techniques and parameters of slope-instability investigation and monitoring of their occurrence, reliability and {{the applicability of the}} monitoring techniques for early warning. The study is based on information collected from 86 monitored landslides in 14 European and Asian countries. Based on the responses, lidar ALS (airborne laser scanners), geophysical <b>logging,</b> <b>aerial</b> photographs, resistivity surveying, GB InSAR (ground-based synthetic aperture radar interferometer) and the refraction seismic were considered the most reliable methods for investigation of structure and character of landslides. Especially lidar ALS and geophysical logging were ranked high despite their application at relatively few landslides. Precipitation amount, pore-water pressure and displacement monitored by wire extensometers, dGPS and total stations, followed by air temperature and EM-emissions monitoring and displacement monitored by the TM 71 crack gauge were considered the most promising parameters for early warning...|$|R
50|$|The {{district}} {{includes a}} mining adit and stope, an <b>aerial</b> tramway, four <b>log</b> structures, a log ore mill, a stable, trash dumps and a dam on Johnson Lake. Three cabins were built for accommodations, three small cabins for sleeping and storage, {{and a larger}} communal cabin. There is also evidence of tent platforms. The site is well preserved, {{with some of the}} mining equipment intact. The aerial tramway transported ore from the mine 300 m across a steep slope to a terminal building, where the ore was packing in barrels and hauled by mule 1.1 km to the mill. The milled ore was then packed 1.8 mi to the location of the present Shoshone Campground and further transferred 18 mi to Garrison, Utah. From Garrison the ore went 75 mi to the railroad at Frisco, Utah.|$|R
40|$|Harvesting {{operations}} in Turkey are performed using traditional methods employing mostly animals and manpower for skidding and tractors mainly for winching. To apply these methods efficiently, the trees {{have to be}} bucked into short lengths logs (3 - 4 m), which reduces log values and overall profits. To produce longer <b>logs,</b> <b>aerial</b> harvesting methods such as cable logging and helicopter logging could be implemented, especially in productive forests located in steep mountainous regions of Turkey. Almost all of the forests in Turkey are state forests and managed by the General Directorate of Forestry (GDF). The GDF uses helicopters in firefighting activities; however, helicopters have not been used in harvesting operations. Using helicopters in both firefighting and harvesting may increase the utilization rate of helicopters and reduce the average helicopter unit cost. The {{purpose of this study}} is to identify the factors affecting the cost and productivity of helicopter logging and to analyze the utilization of helicopter logging in Turkish forestry...|$|R
40|$|The {{handbook}} {{does not}} attempt to define a single “best ” system for any site. Instead, it presumes that readers {{need to be aware}} of the key factors that influence the probability of achieving success with any given combination of equipment and site characteristics. Readers will then use their own judgement to evaluate the merits of the various options. The information in the handbook should be considered only as part of an overall process for equipment selection which will vary from company to company. PRIMARY TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT Harvesting timber consists of several phases: falling the trees, manufacturing them into logs, and transporting the logs from the stump to a landing or roadside and then to a conversion facility. Many factors influence the exact sequence and details of these phases, but regardless of the details, the basic concept remains the same: harvesting timber consists of cutting trees and transporting them from one location to another. The operations are conducted sequentially, and the output of one phase becomes the input to the subsequent phase. The most common method for classifying harvesting systems is to consider the primary transport phase; that is, from stump to the landing or roadside. Although usually the second phase in sequence, primary transport is discussed first in the handbook because of its importance. The three basic classes of primary transport are ground-based, cable, and aerial. In groundbased harvesting systems, the logs are dragged or carried from the stump to the landing by a machine that travels over the ground. In cable systems, an overhead cable attached to a stationary machine is used to drag or carry the logs; in <b>aerial</b> systems, the <b>logs</b> are lifted above the ground by a machine that derives its lift from the air. This section of the handbook describes the defining features of these three classes of primary transport equipment. The features described here determine the generally accepted operating range of the equipment, but not necessarily the entire operating range. Some makes or models may include unique features used to extend the normal operating range. These unique design Figure 4 A mid-sized skidder, typical of many ground-based operations in th...|$|R
