40|$|Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) {{are thought}} to result from the {{interaction}} of an extremely relativistic outflow interacting {{with a small amount}} of material surrounding the site of the explosion. Multi-wavelength observations covering the gamma-ray to radio wavebands allow investigations of this "fireball" model. On 23 January 1999 optical emission was detected while the gamma-ray burst was still underway. Here we report the results of gamma-ray, optical/infra-red, sub-mm, mm and radio observations of this burst and its <b>afterflow,</b> which indicate that the prompt and <b>afterflow</b> emissions from GRB 990123 are associated with three distinct regions in the fireball. The afterglow one day after the burst has a much lower peak frequency than those of previous bursts; this explains the short-lived nature of the radio emission, which is not expected to reapear. We suggest that such differences reflect variations in the magnetic-field strengths in the afterglow emitting regions...|$|E
40|$|A fast flow {{discharge}} apparatus {{was used to}} measure the rate constant for the reaction of ground state oxygen atoms with dichlorine monoxide in the temperature range 236 - 295 K. The air <b>afterflow</b> technique (NO 2 chemiluminescence) was used for detection of oxygen atoms. The Arrhenius expression for the rate constant was found to be 2. 7 plus or minus 0. 3 times 10 to the - 11 th power exp(- 560 plus or minus 80 /T) cu cm per molecule per sec. At 295 K the rate constant is 4. 1 plus or minus 0. 5 times 10 to the - 12 th power cu cm per molecule per sec...|$|E
40|$|Ideally, the {{reflection}} of a shock from the closed end of a shock tube provides, for laboratory study, a quantity of stationary gas at extremely high temperature. Because of the action of viscosity, however, the flow in the real case is not one-dimensional, and a boundary layer grows in the fluid following the initial shock wave. In this paper simplifying assumptions are made to allow {{an analysis of the}} interaction of the shock reflected from the closed end with the boundary layer of the initial shock <b>afterflow.</b> The analysis predicts that interactions of several different types will exist in different ranges of initial shock Mach number. It is shown that the cooling effect of the wall on the <b>afterflow</b> boundary layer accounts for the change in interaction type. An experiment is carried out which verifies the existence of the several interaction regions and shows that they are satisfactorily predicted by the theory. Along with these results, sufficient information is obtained from the experiments to make possible a model for the interaction in the most complicated case. This model is further verified by measurements made during the experiment. The case of interaction with a turbulent boundary layer is also considered. Identifying the type of interaction with the state of turbulence of the interacting boundary layer allows for an estimate of the state of turbulence of the boundary layer based on an experimental investigation of the type of interaction. A method is proposed whereby the effect of the boundary-layer interaction on the strength of the reflected shock may be calculated. The calculation indicates that the reflected shock is rapidly attenuated for a short distance after reflection, and this result compares favorably with available experimental results...|$|E
50|$|The Nimbus Fish Hatchery was {{established}} {{as part of}} a greater habitat mitigation network. Currently in the system small Chinook fry from the hatchery are being released lower down river in the American and Sacramento river to avoid predation from larger fish, such as bass. The small fry are often targets of other fish and water fowl in the environmental corridor. A goal of the hatchery is to increase the annual salmon return by releasing closer up river near the hatchery. With this comes a further distance to the ocean, but it may be a safer one. By doing so it would imbed in the hatchery salmon the migratory route {{to come back to the}} hatchery from which they came. The Hatchery also plans to find colder water sources for summer runs to minimize the water temperature in regards to the warming climate. The hatchery is there to provide adequate space, <b>afterflows,</b> and temperature regimes.|$|R
50|$|The {{hatchery}} supplements {{the natural}} population but also draws up many concerns on its potential effects. One concern {{is how the}} hatchery population relates to the natural population. Main concerns focus on competition, predation, effects of behavior, and potential disease. Due to a varied type of rearing, hatchery fish populations may react to the natural environment differently. They are coming from a controlled environment and entering habitats not only impacted by nature, but societies urban impacts also. In some land locked populations they fight greater for survival. Ever since a small egg first laid in gravel the natural population has had to fight for survival and food. This does give natural populations an advantage to regional familiarity The hatchery is there to provide adequate space, <b>afterflows,</b> and temperature regimes. To greater understand the impacts of the hatchery population, monitoring teams need {{to be put in}} place. This will allow for special groups to ensure cohabitation without detriment to the naturally occurring population.|$|R
50|$|The {{hatchery}} {{is part of}} {{a greater}} interconnected network within the region. The dams upstream from the hatchery generate power, supply water, and are a main source of flood control. As shown in figure 3, the weirs guide salmon {{in the direction of the}} ladder to enter the hatchery. The ladder brings them up to harvest and spawning tanks. In November through March the fish Ladder is filled with water to allow for the fish to move up to the ladder. The gates close when the raceway is full, and there is potential for overcrowding. From here workers harvest milk from the adult salmon and fertilize the eggs. There are separate holding tanks for each species, Chinook salmon, steelhead, and rainbow trout. As the fish grow in size they move down the holding tanks. There is a one way gate leading to the holding ponds. The fish then move into a tranquilizing tank on the spawning deck. Only mature salmon are harvested. The holding tanks simulate the natural river flow. The fish jump up the flow to move between tanks. Once the fish grow large enough to survive on their own, between four and six inches, they are carried in tanks further down the river. From here they make their way down stream and eventually journey out to sea. The hatchery is there to provide adequate space, <b>afterflows,</b> and temperature regimes.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the shock {{reflection}} process at plane walls (wedges) which is known as pseudo-steady. Questions still arise concerning the transition from regular reflection to irregular reflection, when the experimental transition data are compared to von Neumanns theoretical predictions. Recently several authors have shown experimentally that for weak incident shocks the transition takes place at wedges with inclinations at which the corner signal is able {{to catch up to}} the reflection point (sonic criterion). The paper intends to confirm this result for stronger incident shocks by evaluation of visualized experiments. Furthermore it will be shwon, by using gage measurements, that the corner signal is followed by a rather intensive rarefaction wave. This wave strongly influences the <b>afterflow</b> region of the reflected shock. The boundary conditions of the von Neumann Theory are discussed in light of this, and an approach by Skews is quoted...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study is}} made of the transient response in two acoustic systems. Each system consists of an ideal fluid in contact with an elastic solid. In one case the interface is plane, in the other case it is cylindrical. In the plane case {{it is found that}} an exact algebraic solution can be obtained on the axis of symmetry. The vertical displacement at axial points is composed of the acoustic, <b>afterflow,</b> and correction terms. In solids for which Poisson's ratio is greater than one third the initial variation of the correction is toward positive values (corresponding to motion directed toward the interface). In solids for which Poisson's ratio is less than one third the initial variation may be either positive or negative depending on the magnitude of the compressional velocity ratio. An interface wave is shown to exist regardless of the choice of elastic parameters. It is found that the reflected wave has a forerunner in the region of the fluid in which the refracted wave is the first arrival. In the cylindrical case the initial pulse shape is distorted upon reflection. It is found that as the wave approaches the axis of the cylinder the leading edge steepens. If, at the source, the initial slope of the pressure-time curve is finite the amount of steepening is infinite. An exact expresson for the transient response at points off the axis is obtained which can be evaluated by numerical means...|$|E
