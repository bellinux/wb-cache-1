30|$|Estimation of pore-fluid {{pressures}} {{depends on}} the <b>assumed</b> <b>stress</b> pattern, as demonstrated in the previous section. The discrepancy between the assumed and true stress patterns yields modeling errors in the estimation of pore-fluid pressure. Unlike random observation errors, modeling errors will cause biased results in inversion analysis (e.g., Yagi and Fukahata 2008). In this section, we consider the estimation errors of the regional stress pattern (Terakawa et al. 2016) in the FMT analysis. In “Estimation errors of the regional stress field around Mt. Ontake” section, we evaluated the estimation errors of the regional stress pattern using multivariate normal random numbers. In “FMT analysis considering estimation errors of the <b>assumed</b> <b>stress</b> pattern” section, we determined the average value of the pore-fluid pressure triggering each event in the final dataset in “Data for the FMT analysis” section, considering the estimation errors of the <b>assumed</b> <b>stress</b> pattern. Subsequently, we applied the FMT method to these data to estimate the pore-fluid pressure field. Comparing the pore-fluid pressure field in “Pore-fluid pressure field with the regional stress pattern” section with that in “FMT analysis considering estimation errors of the <b>assumed</b> <b>stress</b> pattern” section, we evaluated the level of pore-fluid pressure driving microseismic swarm activity.|$|E

Based on, it is concluded. in theory that the zero-energy stress m ode cannot suppress the zero-energy deformation modes but increase the extra rigidity to the nonzero-energy deformation modes of the element instead. So {{they should not be}} employed to assume the stress field. In addition, the parasitic stress modes will produce the spurious parasitic energy and result the element behaving over rigidity. Thus, they should not be used into the <b>assumed</b> <b>stress</b> field even though they can suppress the zero-energy deformation modes of the element. The numerical examples show the performance of the elements including the zero-energy stress modes or the parasitic stress modes...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} eight-node solid-shell {{elements for}} geometric non-linear analysis of elastic shells. To subdue shear, trapezoidal and thickness locking, the assumed natural strain method and {{an ad hoc}} modified generalized laminate stiffness matrix are employed. A selectively reduced integrated element is formulated with its membrane and bending shear strain components taken to be constant and equal to the ones evaluated at the element centroid. With the generalized stresses arising from the modified generalized laminate stiffness matrix assumed to be independent from the ones obtained from the displacement, an extended Hellinger-Reissner functional can be derived. By choosing the <b>assumed</b> generalized <b>stresses</b> similar to the <b>assumed</b> <b>stresses</b> of a previous solid element, a hybrid-stress solid-shell element is formulated. Commonly employed geometric non-linear homogeneous and laminated shell problems are attempted and our results are close {{to those of other}} state-of-the-art elements.

40|$|A novel {{method is}} {{presented}} to orthogonalize the basic deformation modes for hybord stress elements. It is shown that the resulting orthogonal basic deformation modes are independent of elastic constants {{and they can be}} used to investigate the hybrid elements with different <b>assumed</b> <b>stress</b> fields. It is noted that a deformation mode appears to be a zero-energy mode when its strain-driven stress mode is orthogonal to all the <b>assumed</b> <b>stress</b> modes. This provides an easy way to identify the spurious modes of a given element. In addition, based upon the orthogonality relationship between the given initial stress modes and the orthogonal basic deformation modes, the necessary stress modes to formulate a hybrid element free of spurious modes can be straightforwardly selected from the stress matrix including the given initial stress modes. Furthermore, it is found that the orthogonal condition of the basic deformation modes is not only necessary but also sufficient to derive the <b>assumed</b> <b>stress</b> field that can produce a hybrid element free of zero-energy modes. Several numerical examples are illustrated in details to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed basic deformation mode method...|$|E
30|$|In this section, we {{investigated}} {{the dependence of}} pore-fluid pressures on the <b>assumed</b> <b>stress</b> pattern and re-evaluated the 3 -D pore-fluid pressure field around Mt. Ontake. We applied the same (FMT) method to the same dataset of earthquake focal mechanism solutions as Terakawa et al. (2013 b). We assumed the regional stress field inferred from microseismicity around Mt. Ontake (Terakawa et al. 2016), whereas the stress field used by Terakawa et al. (2013 b) was based on part of the tectonic stress field in and around Japan (Terakawa and Matsu’ura 2010). In “Data for the FMT analysis” section, we summarized the dataset to estimate pore-fluid pressure. In “Pore-fluid pressure field with the regional stress pattern” section, we estimated the 3 -D distribution of pore-fluid pressure around Mt. Ontake and compared the result with that of Terakawa et al. (2013 b). In “Tectonic and regional stress fields around Mt.

40|$|Hybrid {{finite element}} methods are {{superior}} to conventional displacement-based finite element formulations in many aspects and to date many types of hybrid elements have been proposed based on different <b>assumed</b> <b>stress</b> fields. However, {{some of them are}} essentially equivalent to each other and there is no general approach available yet to determine their corresponding relationships. In addition. even though the hybrid techniques have many advantages compared to the displacement-based elements, there is an obvious disadvantage, the additional computational cost of the matrix inversions required in constructing element stiffness matrix. In this paper, we show that a linearly independent transformation of the <b>assumed</b> <b>stress</b> field for a given element leads to an equivalent hybrid finite element. This is verified through the proof of equivalence between various existing hybrid elements proposed by different researchers. To improve the computational efficiency, a new inner product including the compliant matrix of material is introduced. With this new definition of inner product, it simplified orthogonalization procedure for the <b>assumed</b> <b>stress</b> modes is then proposed. Based oil the orthonorm stress modes obtained using the proposed orthogonalization, an explicit formulation of the hybrid element stiffness matrix is presented. The effectiveness of the present method is validated by numerical examples. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|E

30|$|We re-evaluated the 3 -D pore-fluid {{pressure}} field around Mt. Ontake {{from the same}} dataset of earthquake focal mechanism solutions used in Terakawa et al. (2013 b), but used the high-resolution regional stress field (Terakawa et al. 2016). In the FMT method, we measure pore-fluid pressures by examining fault orientations relative to the stress pattern at hypocenters. When the <b>assumed</b> <b>stress</b> pattern is inappropriate, the modeling errors will yield biased results for pore-fluid pressure. We detected large {{differences between the two}} pore-fluid {{pressure field}}s in the region A, whose northern part has the most intense microseismic swarm activity for two decades (Figs.  1, 2, 3). Most focal mechanism solutions of the microseismicity were of strike-slip type with P axes along the northwest–southeast direction; these events were generally slip on faults that are favorably oriented to the regional stress pattern (Figs.  1, 4 a). However, the tectonic stress pattern, which is the <b>assumed</b> <b>stress</b> pattern of Terakawa et al. (2013 b), in the region A was characterized by reverse faulting with northwest–southeast compression (Fig.  4 b): these events were slip on misoriented faults to the tectonic stress pattern. In general, there is a larger difference between the shear stresses and fault strength on misoriented faults than that on favorably oriented faults. Therefore, decreases in fault strength resulting from increases in pore-fluid pressure are necessary to trigger events on misoriented faults (Hubbert and Rubey 1959; Hill and Thatcher 1992; Hill 1993). The difference between the <b>assumed</b> <b>stress</b> patterns resulted in that the pore-fluid pressures in the study by Terakawa et al.
