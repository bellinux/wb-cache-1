5|$|In nature, uranium {{is found}} as uranium-238 (99.2739–99.2752%), {{uranium-235}} (0.7198–0.7202%), {{and a very}} small amount of uranium-234 (0.0050–0.0059%). Uranium decays slowly by emitting an alpha particle. The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 billion years and that of uranium-235 is 704 million years, making them useful in dating the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this article}} is to {{identify}} the factors that determine <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> Lithuania’s population and to assess <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> these factors. <b>The</b> article shows Lithuanian population aging factors analysis, which consists of two main parts: the first describes <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population and its characteristics in theoretical terms. Second part is dedicated to <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> trends that influence the aging population and demographic factors and also to analyse <b>the</b> determinants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population <b>of</b> Lithuania.

5|$|Lichen-like fossils {{have been}} found in the Doushantuo Formation in {{southern}} China dating back to 635–551Ma. Lichens formed a component of the early terrestrial ecosystems, and the estimated <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oldest terrestrial lichen fossil is 400Ma; this date corresponds to the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oldest known sporocarp fossil, a Paleopyrenomycites species found in the Rhynie Chert. The oldest fossil with microscopic features resembling modern-day basidiomycetes is Palaeoancistrus, found permineralized with a fern from the Pennsylvanian. Rare in the fossil record are the Homobasidiomycetes (a taxon roughly equivalent to the mushroom-producing species of the Agaricomycetes). Two amber-preserved specimens provide evidence that the earliest known mushroom-forming fungi (the extinct species Archaeomarasmius leggetti) appeared during the late Cretaceous, 90Ma.|$|E

5|$|A new tyrannosaurid {{specimen}} (OMNH 10131), including skull fragments, {{ribs and}} parts of the hindlimb, was reported from New Mexico in 1990 and assigned to the now-defunct genus Aublysodon. Many later authors have reassigned this specimen, along with a few others from New Mexico, to yet another unnamed species of Daspletosaurus. However, research published in 2010 showed that this species, from the Hunter Wash Member of the Kirtland Formation, is actually a more primitive tyrannosauroid, and was classified in the genus Bistahieversor. There is currently disagreement over the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kirtland Formation, with some workers claiming a late Campanian age, while others suggest a younger age in the early Maastrichtian stage.|$|E

Bennington was not scrapped but was purchased in 1913 by the Matson Line for use as a molasses barge. She was towed to Honolulu and remained in use there from 1913 until 1924, when she was scuttled off Oahu.|$|E
