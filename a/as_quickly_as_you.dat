2500|$|Unlike the {{previous}} album, which involved creating [...] "microloops" [...] that involved building up one-bar samples into multiple bars {{that would make}} up a full song, Palomo said that in composing this album, he recorded a riff from a sound he made and tried to [...] "keep that momentum up". On Era Extraña, {{in order to develop}} ideas he was having while recording the record, it was necessary for him to have more control of the effects and instruments he was using for the album. Making the album helped him learn how to create synth sounds and become a [...] "gear geek", instead of relying on presets as he did with his previous works. He said, [...] "The more tedious aspects of production do have the capacity to take the wind out of your sails, so you always have to navigate through that <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can before you start feeling burnt on the song, before you forget that initial spark that made you even want to write it in the first place".|$|E

5000|$|Unlike other arcade games, {{the player}} cannot {{continue}} {{from where the}} previous game ended. The game cannot be played indefinitely; while {{there are hundreds of}} potential passengers to pick up and deliver, there are {{only a limited number of}} fares in the game. The various passengers scattered throughout the city will randomly appear and disappear throughout the game, but once one is picked up that passenger is unavailable for the rest of that game. The core gameplay in the series has been praised as being [...] "deceptively complex"; as stated by the IGN staff for their review of the Dreamcast version of Crazy Taxi: As you progress through the game's ratings scale by picking up and delivering passengers <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> possible, <b>you</b> will slowly but surely realize that there is much more to the game than getting from point a to b.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Daybreak, Foreman said he wanted viewers to like Derek. He also revealed he had played similar roles to Derek before, but said playing a [...] "hardman" [...] in EastEnders meant he could not leave his character behind when he finished work.

Foreman explained that Derek Branning {{is going to be the}} type of character that's going to really set things alight in the Square. Foreman said that when he was asked to play the part, they told him that he was dangerous, destructive and sexy. He commented: [...] "Well, I haven't seen much of the sexy, but I've seen lots of the dangerous and lots of the destructive! So I think you're going to enjoy him.
