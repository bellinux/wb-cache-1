25|$|Protagoras {{states that}} he has two good pieces of {{evidence}} that people agree with him. First, people do not rebuke the ugly, dwarfish, and weak, but pity them, because they cannot help being as they are, yet they punish the unjust and generally feel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>someone</b> is responsible for not knowing {{something that can be}} taught (323d). Second, they do instruct people who are unjust and irreligious, hoping to impart goodness in them. He says that parents begin with their children from earliest childhood, and teachers carry on the task. Protagoras notes that none of this is surprising, but what would be surprising is if this were not the case (326e). He closes by addressing Socrates' question why, if virtue is teachable, the sons of virtuous men often lack virtue. Protagoras lays out a thought experiment where a hypothetical city state is resting its survival as such to the skill of flute playing. Being {{the most important thing for}} that society, parents would be eager to teach the skill to their sons. Not everyone would be successful though, as we can imagine, as some would have a greater natural inclination than others and often the son of a good flute player would turn out bad and vice versa. Any of them however, even the bad ones, would be better than an average citizen in the real world which might have never been taught how to play. Same goes for virtue, it is considered so important that everyone is taught to a certain degree, to the point that it seems like a part of human nature while it is not (327b–d).|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{singled out}} the {{excessive}} use of angled camera shots. [...] " [...] Roger Christian has learned from better films that directors sometimes tilt their cameras," [...] wrote Ebert, [...] "but he has not learned why." [...] Derivative special effects and illogical plotting were also widely criticized. The Providence Journal highlighted the film's unusual color scheme: [...] "Battlefield Earth's primary colors are blue and gray, adding to the misery. Whenever we glimpse sunlight, the screen goes all stale yellow, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>someone</b> had urinated on the print. This, by the way, {{is not such a}} bad idea." ...|$|E
500|$|Saldívar {{accompanied}} Selena {{on a trip}} to Tennessee {{while the}} singer finished recording a song for her crossover album. Selena told Saldívar some bank statements were missing and asked her to return them as soon as they returned to Texas. Saldívar re-purchased the gun on March 27 and asked Selena to meet her alone at a motel room; this was her second attempt to kill Selena. News of Selena's arrival spread and she was soon mobbed by fans. Quintanilla, Jr. believed her fans saved her that day; there were [...] "too many witnesses". According to him, the third attempt to kill Selena was during Saldívar's trip to Monterrey in the last week of March. Dr. Martinez received telephone calls from Saldívar crying hysterically and saying she had been raped on March 29. The next day, Saldívar again called Dr. Martinez, who said the calls sounded <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>someone</b> was trying to snatch the telephone away from Saldívar. He sent an employee to her motel room to investigate; the employee found she had left a few minutes earlier.|$|E
40|$|Extract] The man jiggles the brick, gauges its weight. His stout hand, a {{flash of}} his watch dial, the sleeve rolled back, muscles on the upper arm bundled tight. His face half-erased by the dark. There's {{something}} going on beneath the surface that Murray can't grasp. He thinks of the three witches in Polanski's Macbeth, huddled together on the beach, digging a circle in the sand with bare hands, unwrapping their filthy bundle. A ritual. The brick's {{in the air and}} it's funny but Murray expected it to spin but it doesn't, it holds its position, arcs forward, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>someone’s</b> taken the sky and pulled it sideways to give the impression of movement, like those chase scenes in the Punch and Judy shows you don't see anymore. The brick hits the cement and fractures. Red dust on cops' shined shoes...|$|R

(With sudden fury he brandishes his fists <b>as</b> <b>though</b> defying <b>someone</b> and growls threateningly.) And I'll get drunk this night--dead, rotten drunk! (He seems to detect disapproval in Mrs. Brennan's face, for he shakes his fist at her and repeats like a solemn oath.) I'll get drunk this night, I'm sayin'! I'll get drunk if my soul roasts for it--and no one in the whole world is strong enough to stop me! ...|$|R
500|$|While waiting outside, {{the police}} {{questioned}} Bamber, who they said seemed calm. According to the Court of Appeal, {{he told them}} about the phone call from his father, and that it sounded <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>someone</b> had cut off the call. He said he did not get along with his sister. When asked whether she might have [...] "gone berserk with a gun", the police said he replied: [...] "I don't really know. She is a nutter. She's been having treatment." [...] The police asked why Nevill would have called Bamber and not the police. Bamber replied that his father was {{the sort of person who}} might want to keep things within the family. He said that he (Bamber) had called the police station, rather than 999, because he did not think it would affect how long the police would take to respond. Over the next few hours he talked about cars in general with one of the officers, saying that the Osea Road caravan site [...] "would be able to stand him a Porsche" [...] soon.|$|E
2500|$|More {{than once}} he had a severe {{reaction}} to a drug. In Kessler, he tried a drug named Sygen which was theorized to help reduce damage to the spinal cord. The drug caused him to go into anaphylactic shock, and his heart stopped. He claimed to have had an out-of-body experience and remembered saying, [...] "I'm sorry, but I have to go now", during the event. In his autobiography, he wrote, [...] "and then I left my body. I was up on the ceiling...I {{looked down and saw}} my body stretched out on the bed, not moving, while everybody—there were 15 or 20 people, the doctors, the EMTs, the nurses—was working on me. The noise and commotion grew quieter <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>someone</b> were gradually turning down the volume." [...] After receiving a large dose of epinephrine, he woke up and stabilized later that night.|$|E
2500|$|David Flying Hawk was {{the eldest}} son of Felix Flying Hawk. David was a {{performer}} with Wild West Shows and traveled with his grandfather Chief Flying Hawk. In 1924, David Flying Hawk performed in Rhode Island and had a notable encounter with a horse named “King Tut.” [...] “King Tut was a big bay, very rank horse, that we bought at Tribune, Kansas. [...] The real King Tut’s tomb had been discovered along about this time and papers were still carrying {{quite a bit of}} news about it, therefore the name King Tut. [...] The horse had been bucked away from a snubbing horse a few times and we thought he would develop; into a real good, tough bucking horse. [...] A lot of the credit for getting ole Tut started on the road to becoming a great horse must go to a Sioux Indian boy by the name of Dave Flying Hawk, who was on the Knights of Columbus rodeo with us in 1924. [...] This Indian and two others, of the carload that was with us, were bronc riders. [...] Dave was also part of the Indian dance troupe. The program for our opening performance in Providence, Rhode Island was somewhat in turmoil. [...] The Indian dancers had just finished when the arena director, Sammy Garrett, started calling for Flying Hawk to come to the bucking chutes, that his horse was in. [...] King Tut, being pretty wild. Had gone into the chutes first. [...] There being no time for Flying Hawk to change clothes, he came to the chutes in full dance costume—fringed buckskin clothes, feathers, bells—the whole works. [...] While the chute help saddled the big wild King Tut, who hadn’t been to town any more than the Indian had, Flying Hawk put on someone's boots and spurs and eased up over the chute and down onto Tut’s back. [...] When they opened the chute gate and those bells started ringing and those feathers started flopping, that horse went completely berserk. [...] The kid weathered the storm for about five jumps before he went into orbit. [...] It looked <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>someone</b> had shot a wild turkey—the crowd went wild. [...] They thought that it was a special act that Flying Hawk was putting on. [...] That was the funniest thong I’ve ever seen happened at a rodeo. [...] We sold King Tut, along with four or five top horses, to McCarty and Elliott of Cheyenne the next year. [...] I heard {{a few years ago that}} they bucked him until he was nearly twenty-six years old, but I’m sure that he was never as scared in his life as we was with Flying Hawk on board.” ...|$|E
60|$|Uncle Chris {{threw away}} his cigar, {{and put his}} arms round Jill. For a moment a dreadful fear came {{to her that he}} was going to cry. She prayed that he wouldn't cry. It would be too awful. It would be a memory of which she could never rid herself. She felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he were <b>someone</b> {{extraordinarily}} young and unable to look after himself, someone she must soothe and protect.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{have changed}} greatly since then,' he answered. 'I have read your books, and now I see you among all these images, and I {{understand}} you {{better than you}} do yourself, for I have been with many and many dreamers at the same cross-ways. You have shut away the world and gathered the gods about you, {{and if you do}} not throw yourself at their feet, you will be always full of lassitude, and of wavering purpose, for a man must forget he is miserable in the bustle and noise of the multitude in this world and in time; or seek a mystical union with the multitude who govern this world and time.' And then he murmured something I could not hear, and <b>as</b> <b>though</b> to <b>someone</b> I could not see.|$|R
2500|$|In Bobby Lee's [...] "Tae Do," [...] {{a parody}} of Korean dramas in a Mad TV episode, the {{subtitles}} make more sense of the story than the Korean language being spoken. [...] The subtitles are made to appear <b>as</b> <b>though</b> written by <b>someone</b> with a poor understanding of grammar and are often intentionally made longer than what they actually say in the drama. For example, an actor says [...] "Sarang" [...] ("I love you"), but the subtitle is [...] so long that it covers the whole screen.|$|R

60|$|It was <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>someone</b> {{had struck}} his heart with a whip. Never! Never! Never! And she didn't know! He turned {{back from the}} window and the {{department}} with its two apprentices was impossible. The whole glaring world was insupportable.|$|E
60|$|Sola motioned me to {{be seated}} upon a pile of silks {{near the center of}} the room, and, turning, made a {{peculiar}} hissing sound, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> signaling to <b>someone</b> in an adjoining room. In response to her call I obtained my first sight of a new Martian wonder. It waddled in on its ten short legs, and squatted down before the girl like an obedient puppy. The thing was about the size of a Shetland pony, but its head bore a slight resemblance to that of a frog, except that the jaws were equipped with three rows of long, sharp tusks.|$|R
6000|$|His {{road through}} the fields ran past Hawk's Hall, of which he {{observed}} with a thrill of dismay, that the blinds were drawn <b>as</b> <b>though</b> in it <b>someone</b> lay dead. There was no reason why {{he should have been}} dismayed, since he had heard that Isobel had gone away to somewhere in [...] "Ameriky," [...] as Mrs. Parsons had expressed it in a brief and illspelt letter, and that Sir John was living in town. Yet the sight depressed him still further with its suggestion of death, or of separation, which is almost as bad, for, be it remembered, he was at an age when such impressions come home.|$|R
50|$|Ben and Polly {{watch the}} First Doctor {{collapse}} {{to the floor}} of the TARDIS and then change into a younger man. Initially in a state of intense, pained confusion, at last regaining calm by maintaining his focus on a single lever on the TARDIS control console, the new Doctor seems to ignore or deliberately misunderstand direct questions and sometimes refers to his previous self <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he were <b>someone</b> else. Despite this, Polly believes the man is still the Doctor, while Ben suspects he is an impostor. The TARDIS lands on the planet Vulcan where, on arrival, the Doctor witnesses the murder of the examiner, a man sent from Earth to check on the human colony located on the planet. After checking the body, the Doctor discovers a badge.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing, sir, nothing, {{save that}} we only {{did what we}} were driven to do. Moreover, no harm has come of it, since {{whenever}} the noble general came {{to the edge of}} the opened pit, although he was blind, he halted and went off to right or left <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>someone</b> drew him out of danger." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Grooten {{dropped the}} {{cigarette}} {{which he had}} only just lit, and seemed for the moment unconscious of the fact. He {{made no effort to}} pick it up. He quivered <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>someone</b> had struck him a blow. For a man whose impassivity was almost a part of himself he was evidently deeply agitated.|$|E
60|$|The song {{had stopped}} as {{suddenly}} as it began--broken off, you would have said, {{in the middle of}} a note, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>someone</b> had laid his hand upon the singer's mouth. Coming through the clear, sunny atmosphere among the green tree-tops, I thought it had sounded airily and sweetly; and the effect on my companions was the stranger.|$|E
60|$|Instead {{of going}} to the sketch-class, which was held at six in the evening, she hurried to the address that Oliver Haddo had given her. She went along the crowded street stealthily, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> afraid that <b>someone</b> would see her, and her heart was in a turmoil. She desired with all her might not to go, and sought vehemently to prevent herself, and yet withal she went. She ran up the stairs and knocked at the door. She remembered his {{directions}} distinctly. In a moment Oliver Haddo stood before her. He did not seem astonished that she was there. As she stood on the landing, it occurred to her suddenly that she had no reason to offer for her visit, but his words saved her from any need for explanation.|$|R
2500|$|Going to {{the small}} {{telephone}} box with its slender wire attachments, Mr. Bell coolly asked, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> addressing <b>someone</b> in an adjoining room, [...] "Mr. Watson, are you ready!" [...] Mr. Watson, five miles away in Somerville, promptly answered in the affirmative, and soon was heard a voice singing [...] "America". [...] Going to another instrument, connected by wire with Providence, forty-three miles distant, Mr. Bell listened a moment, and said, [...] "Signor Brignolli, who is assisting at a concert in Providence Music Hall, will now sing for us." [...] In a moment the cadence of the tenor's voice rose and fell, the sound being faint, sometimes lost, and then again audible. Later, a cornet solo played in Somerville was very distinctly heard. Still later, a three-part song came over the wire from Somerville, and Mr. Bell told his audience [...] "I will switch off the song {{from one part of}} the room to another so that all can hear." [...] At a subsequent lecture in Salem, Massachusetts, communication was established with Boston, eighteen miles distant, and Mr. Watson at the latter place sang [...] "Auld Lang Syne", the National Anthem, and [...] "Hail Columbia", while the audience at Salem joined in the chorus.|$|R
60|$|So {{they began}} their descent of the hill. Meyer {{did not speak}} again; all his {{attention}} seemed to be concentrated upon finding a safe path on which the horses would not stumble. Nor did Benita speak; she was too utterly exhausted--so exhausted, indeed, that {{she could no longer}} control her mind and imagination. These seemed to loose themselves from her and to acquire new powers, notably that of entering into the secret thoughts of the man at her side. She saw them pass before her like living things, and yet she could not read them. Still, something she did understand--that she had suddenly grown important to this man, not {{in the way in which}} women are generally important to men, but otherwise. She felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she had become interwoven with the objects of his life, and was henceforth necessary to their fulfilment, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she were <b>someone</b> whom he had been seeking for years on years, the one person who could give him light in his darkness.|$|R
60|$|The lamp went out, so {{suddenly}} that Susie was vaguely frightened. It gave one flicker, {{and they were}} in total darkness.

The darkness was so peculiar that for a moment no one stirred.|$|E
60|$|All the {{way back}} to the {{stamping}} ground of the apes, Tarzan sought for an explanation of the strange power which had stayed his hand and prevented him from slaying Mbonga. It was <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>someone</b> greater than he had commanded him to spare the life of the old man. Tarzan could not understand, for he could conceive of nothing, or no one, with the authority to dictate to him what he should do, or what he should refrain from doing.|$|E
6000|$|... "A strange {{merchant}} and a grim, {{as those}} dead Frenchmen may have thought. I tell you, Sir Trader, that your talk {{and the eyes}} of that tall Moor of yours turn my back cold; it is <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>someone</b> walked over my grave. Come, Blanche, let us begone ere our horses be chilled as I am. Master Grimmer, or Hastings, you shall hear from me, unless I can do my business otherwise, and for the trinket send me a note at your leisure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They're off!" [...] That roar, {{like the}} cry of a monster, sounded all around. George steadied his glasses on the rail. Blue with white stripes was leading, the Ambler lying last. Thus they came round the further bend. And Providence, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{determined}} that <b>someone</b> should benefit by his absorption, sent a hand sliding under George's elbows, to remove the pin from his tie and slide away. Round Tattenham Corner George saw his horse take the lead. So, with straw closing up, they came into the straight. The Ambler's jockey looked back and raised his whip; in that instant, as if by magic, straw drew level; down came the whip on the Ambler's flank; again as by magic straw was in front. The saying of his old jockey darted through George's mind: [...] "Mark my words, sir, that 'orse knows what's what, and when they're like that they're best let alone." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the second}} story, twelve-year-old Amanda (Alex McKenna) {{is in an}} online chat room talking to a girl named Jessica, who is {{actually}} an online predator posing as a young girl. One night, her parents go out and rely on her teenage sister Katherine (Devon Odessa) to stay with her. Katherine leaves to go meet her boyfriend, leaving Amanda alone. Later on while searching the garage to find her dog the lights go out, and she becomes anxious and feels <b>as</b> <b>though</b> there is <b>someone</b> else in her house. After finding out that her sister Katherine has just returned home, Amanda heads back to her room. Seeing what looks like her dog under the bed, she lies down and puts her hand down {{to allow it to}} be licked by the dog. While looking in the mirror Amanda sees the phrase [...] "People can lick too" [...] and the man licking her hand. She runs to Katherine's room telling her to call 911. Katherine enters Amanda's room, finds the corpse of the family dog underneath Amanda's bed, and the window open.|$|R
5000|$|This {{is one of}} the few episodes before [...] "Kenny Dies" [...] {{in which}} Kenny does not {{actually}} die, <b>though</b> <b>someone</b> impersonating him does. The Kenny storyline was based on Tom Green and the television show Jackass.|$|R
60|$|James, too, {{was much}} disturbed. He felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>someone</b> had {{threatened}} {{his right to}} invest his money at five per cent. Jolyon had spoiled her. None of his girls would have said such a thing. James had always been exceedingly liberal to his children, and the consciousness of this made him feel {{it all the more}} deeply. He trifled moodily with his strawberries, then, deluging them with cream, he ate them quickly; they, at all events, should not escape him.|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} {{he threw a}} big handful of the roots that I have {{mentioned}} on {{to each of the}} fires, whereon tall flames leapt up from them, very unholy-looking flames which were followed by columns of dense, white smoke that emitted a most powerful and choking odour quite unlike anything that I had ever smelt before. It seemed to penetrate all through me, and that accursed stone in my throat grew as large as an apple and felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>someone</b> were poking it upwards with a stick.|$|E
60|$|Morris {{did not see}} him, for he {{had turned}} his head away; but {{at the mention of}} Mary Porson's name his father started, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>someone</b> had pricked him with a pin. But Colonel Monk had not {{commanded}} a regiment with some success and been a military attache for nothing; having filled diplomatic positions, public and private, in his time, he could keep his countenance, and play his part when he chose. Indeed, did his simpler-minded son but know it, all that evening he had been playing a part.|$|E
5000|$|Musically, {{this album}} {{is much more}} {{straightforward}} than previous albums, fusing an aggressive death metal style with elements of goth rock. <b>Though</b> <b>someone</b> named [...] "Kostas" [...] is credited for drums, all drums on this album were programmed.|$|R
50|$|One evening, Melissa {{appears to}} both Geno and Frankie. The town clock begins to chime and Frankie realizes that her death re-enactment {{is about to}} commence. The boys follow her ghost to the school then wait. Shortly thereafter, her lifeless body is seen {{descending}} the stairs <b>as</b> <b>though</b> carried by <b>someone</b> invisible. Geno and Frankie follow the body across the schoolyard {{and out into the}} forest. They then watch in horror as the body approaches the cliffs. At the last minute, she awakes and begins screaming for her mother. Her body is raised into the air and then thrown mercilessly over the edge. Her screams are abruptly cut off as the waves crash {{at the base of the}} cliff. Suddenly, a pale woman dressed in white with long streaming blonde hair steps out of the front door of the cottage calling Melissa's name. She calls desperately until she reaches the edge of the cliff and looks down. Upon seeing Melissa's lifeless body on the rocks below, she flings herself off the cliffs in agony. The ghostly scene ends and the shaken brothers head home. Finally, Frankie understands the source of Melissa's anguish. He vows to help her bring the killer to justice.|$|R
