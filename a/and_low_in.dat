5|$|Guinea pig meat is high {{in protein}} <b>and</b> <b>low</b> <b>in</b> fat and cholesterol, and is {{described}} as being similar to rabbit and the dark meat of chicken. The animal may be served fried (chactado or frito), broiled (asado), or roasted (al horno), and in urban restaurants may also be served in a casserole or a fricassee. Ecuadorians commonly consume sopa or locro de cuy, a soup dish. Pachamanca or huatia, a process similar to barbecueing, is also popular, and is usually served with corn beer (chicha) in traditional settings.|$|E
5|$|Periyar {{stated that}} the caste system in south India is, due to Indo-Aryan influence, linked {{with the arrival of}} Brahmins from the north. Ancient Tamil Nadu (part of Tamilakkam) had a {{different}} stratification of society in four or five regions (Tinai), determined by natural surroundings and adequate means of living. Periyar also argued that birds, animals, and worms, which are considered to be devoid of rationalism do not create castes, or differences of high <b>and</b> <b>low</b> <b>in</b> their own species. But man, considered to be a rational being, was suffering from these because of religion and discrimination.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} three pulses were taken which are widely uses in India. These pulses are Urad (black gram), Arhar (red gram) and Masoor (massor). Estimation of {{concentration}} of Protein, Carbohydrate and Fatty acids {{were done with}} fresh pulses, then they were stored for three months in different storage conditions like in polythene, earthen pots, papers, plastic cans and in jute sacs. After Storage the concentration of Protein, Carbohydrate and Fatty acids were decreased. Before the storage of pulses analysis the concentration of protein, carbohydrate and fatty acids.

Nusantara Bioscience 3 : 15 - 22. In order to study floristic and plant species diversity, approximately 450 ha of oak forests were selected in Chenareh, Marivan of Kordestan province in western Iran. Inventory was selectively carried out in 50 m elevation range in the different aspects. Vegetation was surveyed in the four layers including: tree (dbh > 5 cm), regeneration (dbh < 5 cm), shrub and herb. Diversity and richness indices were used to analyze data in the different vegetation layers. Results indicated that 82 plant species found in the studied site, comprise of 9 tree, 3 shrub and 70 herbaceous. The mean diversities and richness measures {{were found to be}} the highest <b>in</b> southwestern <b>and</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>in</b> southeastern <b>and</b> northern aspects for the tree layer.

25|$|IGFBP-3 {{levels in}} human serum are, like IGF-1, {{dependent}} on growth hormone (GH); for example, serum IGFBP-3 is increased in acromegaly <b>and</b> <b>low</b> <b>in</b> GH-deficient children. However, IGFBP-3 gene expression in human liver is GH-independent. Because it is stabilized in human serum by forming complexes with IGF-1 and ALS, which are both GH-dependent, serum IGFBP-3 also appears regulated by GH.

25|$|The wines have {{historically}} been predominantly white, and the finest made from Riesling. Many wines have been sweet <b>and</b> <b>low</b> <b>in</b> alcohol, light and unoaked.

However most exports are still of sweet wines, particularly to the traditional export markets such as Great Britain, which is the leading export market {{both in terms of}} volume and value. The United States (second in value, third in volume) and the Netherlands (second in volume, third in value) are two other important export markets for German wine.|$|E

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. Commercial swine diets are {{composed}} mainly of ingredients such as corn, wheat and soybean to meet energy and protein requirements. Market availability of these ingredients is variable due to limited production {{as well as}} competition among food, feed and fuel. Hence, in order to assure sustainability of swine production in places like Hawaii, alternative feeding system need to be studied, developed and extended. Some agricultural products like purple sweet potato(PSP), okinawan sweet potato (OSP), cassava and taro and some agricultural co-products like macadamia nut cake (MNC), okara, wheat millrun (WMR) and barley brewers grain (BBG), are available locally which could together provide basis for producing more affordable locally manufactured feeds. However, limited information available on nutritional value and digestibility of these potential feedstuffs, limits their use in routine swine feed formulation. The agricultural products and agricultural co-products were obtained from local market to determine nutrient profile and in vitro digestibility. Among the agricultural products, crude protein (CP) content was highest in taro (8. 8 %) <b>and</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>in</b> cassava (3. 7 %). Ether extract (EE) was highest in PSP (2. 7 %) <b>and</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>in</b> cassava (1. 0 %). Acid detergent fiber (ADF) content was highest in taro (10. 3 %) <b>and</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>in</b> PSP (5. 6 %). Neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content was highest in taro (11. 4 %) <b>and</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>in</b> PSP (7. 9 %). The starch content was highest in cassava (60. 8 %) <b>and</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>in</b> taro (38. 4 %). Gross energy was highest in taro (4333 Kcal/kg) <b>and</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>in</b> PSP (4134). Among the agricultural co-products. Crude protein content was highest in MNC (25. 5 %) <b>and</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>in</b> BBG (11. 7 %). Ether extract content was highest in okara (13. 3 %) <b>and</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>in</b> BBG (1. 7 %). The ADF content was highest in MNC (28. 0 %) <b>and</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>in</b> okara (19. 7 %). The NDF content was highest in WMR (42. 0 %) <b>and</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>in</b> okara (31. 0 %). The MNC had 2. 8 and 0. 2 %, linoleic acid and linolenic acid content, respectively, lysine concentration was 0. 7 %. In vitro dry matter digestibility was significantly higher (P ˂ 0. 001) in PSP (86. 8 %) than taro (70. 3 %). In vitro gross energy digestibility was significantly higher (P ˂ 0. 001) in PSP (87. 5 %) than taro (64. 9 %). In vitro crude protein digestibility was significantly higher (P ˂ 0. 05) in PSP (76. 3 %) and cassava (74. 4 %) than taro (63. 1 %) and OSP (63. 1 %). Among agricultural co-products, in vitro dry matter digestibility among co-products was significantly higher (P ˂ 0. 05) in MNC (75. 71 %) and okara (74. 10 %) than BBG (61. 33 %).
