5|$|He {{wore the}} #3 jersey for the New York Yankees in 1947, {{and was one}} of the last players to wear it before it was retired in honor of Babe Ruth the {{following}} year. On December 11, 1947, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians for pitcher Red Embree. To begin the 1948 Cleveland Indians season, Clark was in a crowded outfield position battle, with Larry Doby, Thurman Tucker, and Wally Judnich fighting for playing time, but Clark was noted as the most interesting to watch by The Sporting News due to owner Bill Veeck's high regard for him. The only weakness noted in his game was a sore arm from the previous season, to which Clark responded that reading the newspaper was the first time he noticed <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> bad arm.|$|E
25|$|In {{letters and}} diaries that have surfaced, neither George Washington, Col. Ross, Robert Morris, {{nor any other}} member of Congress {{mentioned}} <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> national flag in 1776. Francis Hopkinson, a treasurer of loans and {{a consultant to the}} second congressional committee, has a naval design from 1780 which was clearly a derivative of earlier designs.|$|E
25|$|Following this success, Crowe {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} for 1984's The Wild Life, the pseudo-sequel to Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Whereas its predecessor followed teenagers' lives in high school, The Wild Life traced {{the lives of}} several teenagers after high school living in an apartment complex. Filmmaker James L. Brooks noticed Crowe's original voice and {{wanted to work with}} him. Brooks executive produced Crowe's first directing effort, 1989's Say <b>Anything...,</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> young man pining away for the affections of the seemingly perfect girl. Though it could have easily ended up a formulaic teen love story, Say Anything... got glowing reception from critics. They applauded the way Crowe crafted an intriguing and insightful tale that also involved the girl's relationship with her father and how it is threatened when she discovers he is caught up in a shady business deal.|$|E

40|$|I {{demonstrate}} that econometric estimations of {{nominal interest rate}} rules may tell little, if <b>anything,</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> economy's determinacy properties. In particular, correct inference about the interest-rate response to inflation provides no information about determinacy. Instead, it could reveal whether optimal monetary policymaking is performed under discretion or commitment. ...|$|R
25|$|Davidson {{points out}} that beliefs and {{meanings}} are inseparable. A person holds a sentence true {{based on what he}} believes and what he takes the sentence to mean. If the interpreter knew what a person believed when that person held a sentence to be true, the meaning of the sentence could then be inferred. Vice versa, if the interpreter knew what a person took a sentence to mean when that person held it to be true, the belief of the speaker could be inferred. So Davidson doesn't allow the interpreter to have access to beliefs as evidence, since the interpreter would then be begging the question. Instead, Davidson allows that the interpreter can reasonably ascertain when a speaker holds a sentence true, without knowing <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> particular belief or meaning. That will then allow the interpreter to construct hypotheses relating a speaker and an utterance to a particular state of affairs at a particular time.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in the 1950s, Erickson's use of {{interventions}} influenced strategic therapy and family systems therapy of practitioners including Virginia Satir and Jay Haley.

When asked [...] "Will there be any more of The League of Gentlemen?", Shearsmith simply replied [...] "Yes" [...] but was quick to change the subject and not reveal <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> new series. On the official website, Shearsmith's blog entry for 23 May 2007 stated that the troupe had recently met up in London's West End: [...] "We discussed our next project - it seems we have hit upon something. Early days - but exciting nevertheless." ...|$|E

50|$|YXORP is {{a reverse}} proxy for HTTP, written by Sytse van Slooten. The main focus for YXORP is {{checking}} {{the validity of}} the traffic, i.e. what would be called 'application level firewalling' or 'secure reverse proxy' in commercial products. It can check, validate, and change just <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> HTTP request or response, can load balance, and perform all other normal reversed proxy functions. YXORP aims to conform to RFC 2616, RFC 2518, RFC 2109 and other applicable standards.|$|R

50|$|For instance, we {{are told}} almost daily how the average European or American feels <b>about</b> <b>a</b> topic. It allows social {{scientists}} and pundits to make inferences about cause and say “people are angry at the current administration because {{the economy is doing}} poorly.” This kind of generalization certainly makes sense, but it does not tell us <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> individual. This leads to the idea of an idealized individual, something that is the bedrock of modern economics. Most modern economic theories look at social formations, like organizations, as products of individuals all acting in their own best interest.|$|R
