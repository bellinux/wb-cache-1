Ground Clutter Processing for Wind Measurements with <b>Airport</b> <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Radars</b> Modern <b>airport</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radars</b> (<b>ASR)</b> are coherent pulsed-Doppler radars used for detecting and tracking aircraft in terminal area air-space. These radars might serve an additional role by making radial wind measurements in the immediate vicinity of an airport to provide data on low altitude wind shear (LAWS). One factor that will affect their capability in this role is the requirement that intense low-beam ground clutter be filtered from the signals prior to estimation of the reflectivity and radial velocity of weather scatterers. This report describes and analyzes a specific signal processing algorithm for ASR weather parameter measurements. An adaptively selected Finite Impulse Response high-pass filter is used for ground clutter suppression, followed by pulse-pair weather reflectivity and radial velocity estimation. Measurements from a Lincoln Laboratory-developed testbed ASR in Huntsville, Alabama are used to characterize the ground clutter environment under siting conditions that are representative of operational ASRs. Temporal fluctuations in ground clutter intensity are analyzed with attention to their impact on the adaptive clutter-filter selection procedure. The performance of the signal processing algorithms is then analyzed using the testbed ASR ground clutter measurements in combination with simulated or real weather signals. We conclude that ground clutter and the requisite Clutter filtering will not severely distort ASR wind shear measurements when the reflectivity factor of the microburst or gust front is approximately 20 dBz or greater. This is typically the case for microbursts occurring in moist conditions such as prevail over the Eastern United States during summer...|$|R
40|$|Radars have {{commonly}} {{been used}} for bird detection since the late 1940 s. More sophisticated methodologies have been developed over the past 15 years {{in an effort to}} provide advisories to pilots flying high-speed, low-level operations. More recently, radars have been used to identify and track bird movements around airports and bombing ranges to develop risk models for bird avoidance. We investigated various radar systems for detecting potentially hazardous bird movements on and in the vicinity of New Orleans International Airport. The systems were used to determine their potential in providing information for development of management strategies, active bird control efforts, community planning, and in-flight advisories. Systems evaluated include: Terminal Doppler Weather <b>Radar,</b> <b>Airport</b> <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Radar,</b> NEXRAD, mobile S-band, and tactical personnel radar. The Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) is a 5 cm wavelength (C-band) pulsed Doppler radar that was developed as part of the Integrated Terminal Weather System (ITWS). The main purpose of this system is to identify gust fronts and weather conditions likely to generate wind shear. TDWR systems are located at selected commercial airports that have had a history of turbulent weather. TDWR radar monitors are located in the tower cab and often show large bird movements around the <b>airport.</b> The <b>Airport</b> <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Radars</b> (<b>ASR)</b> are used by air traffic controllers for monitoring approaching and departing aircraft. The ASR- 9 is a 10 cm (S-band), fan-beam radar commonly found on commercial airports. These units may also depict bird movements {{in the vicinity of the}} airport when the gain is set high. The Next Generation Weather Radar (WSR 88 -D) was jointly developed by the FAA, the National Weather Service, and the Department of Defense to provide nationwide weather information. NEXRAD is a 10 cm pulsed Doppler radar that has an effective bird detection range of approximately 64 nautical miles. The uses and limitations of these systems for bird detection on commercial airports will be examined. Additionally the use of specialized bird detection radar and mobile radar systems will be discussed...|$|R

5000|$|An <b>airport</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> (<b>ASR)</b> is a {{radar system}} used at {{airports}} {{to detect and}} display the presence and position of aircraft in the terminal area, the airspace around airports. It is the main {{air traffic control system}} for the airspace around airports. At large airports it typically controls traffic within a radius of 60 miles (96 km) of the airport. The sophisticated systems at large airports consist of two different radar systems, the primary and secondary surveillance radar. [...] The primary radar typically consists of a large rotating parabolic antenna dish that sweeps a vertical fan-shaped beam of microwaves around the airspace surrounding the airport. It detects the position and range of aircraft by microwaves reflected back to the antenna from the aircraft's surface. In the US the primary radar operates at a frequency of 2.7 - 2.9 GHz in the S band with a peak radiated power of 25 kW and an average power of 2.1 kW. The secondary surveillance radar consists of a second rotating antenna, often mounted on the primary antenna, which interrogates the transponders of aircraft, which transmits a radio signal back containing the aircraft's identification, barometric altitude, and an emergency status code, which is displayed on the radar screen next to the return from the primary radar. [...] It operates at a frequency of 1.03 - 1.09 GHz in the L band with peak power of 160 - 1500 W.|$|E

The United <b>Airport</b> <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Radar</b> (<b>ASR)</b> manufacturers are proposing the use of nonlinear FM pulse compression in their all solid state radars. However there is concern that the use of pulse compression will limit the radar’s performance. High range sidelobes can cause poor performance in both target and weather detection. The theory of nonlinear FM pulse compression is derived along with a method of minimizing the sidelobes using a minimum mean square error (MMSE) technique. The results of a computer program using the MMSE technique show that very low sidelobe levels. of more ” than 100 dB down may be achieved. These very low sidelobes are affected by filter misalignment, target Doppler, and by transmitter phase errors or stability. Curves are presented demonstrating these effects. We also show ho...|$|E
