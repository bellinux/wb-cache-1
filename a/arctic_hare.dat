Attempts to introduce the <b>Arctic</b> <b>hare</b> and the muskox have both failed. There are fifteen to twenty types of marine mammals, including whales, dolphins, seals, walruses, and polar bears.|$|E
5|$|Among animals, {{variable}} snow camouflage {{is a type}} {{of seasonal}} polyphenism with a distinct winter plumage or pelage. It is found in birds such as the rock ptarmigan, lagomorphs such as the <b>Arctic</b> <b>hare,</b> mustelids such as the stoat, and one canid, the Arctic fox. Since these have evolved separately, the similar appearance is due to convergent evolution. Some high Arctic species like the snowy owl and polar bear however remain white all year round.|$|E
5|$|On {{a longer}} timescale, animals like the <b>Arctic</b> <b>hare,</b> Arctic fox, stoat, and rock {{ptarmigan}} have snow camouflage, changing their coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey {{in the summer}} to white in the winter; the Arctic fox is the only species in the dog family to do so. However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year-round.|$|E

5|$|The tundra is a sub-Arctic zone with long, cold winters and short, warm summers. Precipitation is low. Soil a meter {{below ground}} and deeper is {{permanently}} frozen (permafrost), {{which does not}} allow water to drain easily through the soil, so it collects in shallow pools. Trees and shrubs are stunted since their roots cannot grow into the permafrost. Low shrubs, lichens, mosses, and small herbaceous plants are found instead. The most common mammals on the tundra are the barren-ground caribou, Arctic wolf, Arctic fox, <b>Arctic</b> <b>hare,</b> lemmings, and voles. Occasional sightings of muskoxen have been made near Cape Chidley, Labrador's most northerly point. The polar bear is the dominant carnivore of the tundra, but is an occasional visitor to coastal Newfoundland, especially in the spring. Many birds migrate to Labrador in spring to lay their eggs and raise their young before returning south for the winter, including the common eider, harlequin duck, Common redpoll and American pipit. The Labrador tundra is also permanent home to ptarmigan.|$|E
25|$|The {{biodiversity}} of tundra is low: 1,700 {{species of}} vascular plants and only 48 species of land mammals can be found, although millions of birds migrate there {{each year for}} the marshes. There are also a few fish species. There are few species with large populations. Notable animals in the Arctic tundra include caribou (reindeer), musk ox, <b>Arctic</b> <b>hare,</b> Arctic fox, snowy owl, lemmings, and polar bears (only near ocean-fed bodies of water). Tundra is largely devoid of poikilotherms such as frogs or lizards.|$|E
25|$|The {{conditions}} {{here are}} far too severe for reptiles and amphibians to survive, and insects are also rare in the region. Muskoxen and barren-ground caribou are the only large herbivores in this environment, while polar bears and the Arctic wolf are the only large carnivores {{to be found in}} the region. Smaller herbivores include the <b>Arctic</b> <b>hare</b> and the collared lemming. Arctic foxes and stoats are some of the smaller carnivores found in the region. Marine mammals include narwhals, beluga whales, walrus, and ringed and bearded seals.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. We studied winter habitat use and {{interspecific}} associations among large- {{and medium-sized}} herbivores on southeastern Victoria Island, Arctic Canada, by documenting the deposition of feces {{in relation to}} vegetation. Associations between ptarmigan (Lagopus spp.), <b>arctic</b> <b>hares</b> (Lepus arcticus), caribou (Rangifer tarandus), and muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) were assessed using the Jaccard Index (JI) and χ 2 at two scales, i. e., with 1 m 2 and 1 ha as sampling units. JI values for species pairs were greater at the larger scale, but χ 2 revealed significant (positive) associations only at the smaller scale and only between <b>arctic</b> <b>hares</b> and caribou and between <b>arctic</b> <b>hares</b> and ptarmigan. Comparative use of habitats was described with respect to vegetation by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Ptarmigan and muskoxen were most strongly correlated with lowland vegetation and caribou with upland vegetation; <b>arctic</b> <b>hares</b> were intermediate. CCA also indicated rather wide separation in the multivariate space, further suggesting distinct patterns of habitat use. The results imply that these species were segregated {{in their use of}} resources in this High Arctic environment...|$|R

500|$|The white {{protective}} coloration {{of arctic}} animals was noted by an early student of camouflage, the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, in his 1889 book Darwinism; he listed the polar bear, the American polar hare, the snowy owl and the gyr falcon as remaining white all year, while the arctic fox, <b>arctic</b> <b>hare,</b> ermine and ptarmigan change their colour, and observed [...] "the obvious explanation", {{that it was}} for concealment. Later zoologists such as Hugh B. Cott have echoed his observations, adding that other animals of the Arctic such as musk ox, moose, reindeer, wolverine and raven never become white [...] "even in the coldest parts of their range". Cott noted that both animals that hunt, like polar bear and stoat, and prey animals like ptarmigan and mountain hare, require camouflage to hide from prey or from predators respectively. There is little experimental evidence for the adaptiveness of white as camouflage, though the ornithologist W. L. N. Tickell, reviewing proposed explanations of white plumage in birds, writes that in the ptarmigan [...] "it is difficult to escape the conclusion that cryptic brown summer plumage becomes a liability in snow, and white plumage is therefore another cryptic adaptation." [...] All the same, he notes, [...] "in spite of winter plumage, many Ptarmigan in NE Iceland are killed by Gyrfalcons throughout the winter." ...|$|E

The polar bear is also a predator, though it prefers to hunt for marine life from the ice. There are also many [...] and marine species endemic to the colder regions. Other {{terrestrial}} animals include wolverines, moose, Dall sheep, ermines, and Arctic ground squirrels. Marine mammals include seals, walrus, and several species of cetacean—baleen whales and also narwhals, killer whales, and belugas. An excellent and famous example of a ring species exists and has been described around the arctic circle {{in the form of}} the Larus gulls.|$|E

5|$|Some {{animals of}} the far north, like the showshoe and <b>Arctic</b> <b>hares,</b> <b>Arctic</b> fox, stoat, and rock {{ptarmigan}} change their coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey summer camouflage to white in the winter; the Arctic fox is the only species in the dog family to do so. However, <b>Arctic</b> <b>hares</b> which live in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year-round.

2500|$|The family Leporidae (rabbits and hares) {{is easily}} the most {{significant}} prey group, comprising about 32% of prey known to be taken by golden eagles. Twelve out of sixteen dietary studies in North America showed leporids as the most common prey group, in some areas comprising over 75% of prey remains. In the northern Rocky Mountains and Northern Plains areas, the main prey species are the white-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus townsendii) and the mountain cottontail (Sylvilagus nuttallii). In the Southwest, the Great Basin, and most of California, the main prey species are the black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus) and the desert cottontail (Sylvilagus audubonii), the former being especially important, comprising {{about a quarter of}} North America prey items in a 1976 study. In two studies in southern Idaho, the black-tailed jackrabbit and the two cottontails dominated the diet, comprising over 70% of nest remains. [...] More locally other jackrabbits and cottontails may be taken in smaller numbers. The snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) is thought to be the dominant prey species in the boreal forests of Canada but there have been no dietary studies conducted there. The snowshoe and the larger <b>Arctic</b> <b>hare</b> (Lepus arcticus) {{are some of the most}} significant prey species in Alaska, though in one central Alaskan nest they were secondary to ptarmigan and nests in Denali National Park included only 0.4% leporid remains. Nests in Alberta and Washington had almost no leporid remains as well.|$|E
2500|$|In the wild, Arctic wolves' {{primarily}} prey on muskoxen and Arctic hares. They {{have also}} been found to prey on lemmings (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus), Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus), birds and beetles. It has been also found that Arctic wolves scavenge through garbage. This sort of food source will not always {{be found in the}} Arctic wolves diet because of regional and seasonal availability. Sometimes there is debate whether the muskox or the <b>Arctic</b> <b>hare</b> is the primary prey for the hare-wolf-muskox predator-prey system. Studies provide evidence that the muskoxen are indeed their primary prey because wolf presence and reproduction seems to be higher when muskox is more available than higher hare availability. More supporting evidence suggests that muskoxen provide long-term viability and other ungulates do not appear in wolves diet. Evidence suggesting that Arctic wolves depend more on hares claims that the mature wolf population paralleled the increase of hares rather than muskoxen availability. The study {{goes on to say that}} degree of reliance between the two sources of food is uncertain and that the amount of consumption between the two species depends on the season and year. Debate continues when seasonal and diet of young wolves is discussed. According to one study, muskox calves serve as a primary food source because the needs of pups are greater but another study suggests that [...] "when hares were much more plentiful (Mech, 2000), wolves commonly fed them to their pups during summer." [...] These differences may be attributed to location as well.|$|E

2500|$|The {{estimated}} {{typical range}} of weights of hares hunted by golden eagles is , whereas rabbits hunted weigh {{a little under}} [...] on average. Except for the occasional <b>Arctic</b> <b>hare,</b> white-tailed or antelope jackrabbit (Lepus alleni), most leporids hunted in North America weigh [...] or less, including the smallest hare in the world, the [...] snowshoe hare, and the smallest rabbit in the world, the [...] pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis). In Europe, where the large brown and mountain hares, both sometimes weighing over , are habitually hunted, the prey may be dismembered before being brought to the nest. Across the golden eagle's range, hares and rabbits are generally known to be hunted via either “high soar with glide attack” or “contour flight with short glide attack”. Leporids are basically solitary animals but they can occur at high densities, such as when jackrabbits are at their peak numbers in brushy areas of Western North America or (historically at least) rabbits in similar brush habitats on the Iberian Peninsula. The goal of the golden eagle while hunting hares and rabbits is to catch the prey when it is foraging out in the open. If the leporid becomes aware of the eagle's descent upon them {{more than a few}} seconds before the strike, they invariably break into a fast, hopping run. Once contact is made, rabbits and hares will often kick or try to bite the eagle but escape is unlikely once they are pinned to the ground. In some case they are able to reach vegetative coverage and, if the said cover is sufficiently deep and dense, the eagle cannot pursue them any further. Although rare, golden eagles have been known to use the “walk and grab attack” to pull a leporid out of its cover. Many hunts in Scotland of mountain hare involve a somewhat lengthy tail chase. If the golden eagle is able to intercept a rabbit or hare far out in the open, a twisting and turning tail chase frequently occurs but the odds of survival for the prey are smaller the farther they are from coverage. On occasion, breeding pairs have been observed hunting jackrabbits together, where one will stoop on a gathering of them while the other waits out of sight and assaults one of the jackrabbits being made to run.|$|E
