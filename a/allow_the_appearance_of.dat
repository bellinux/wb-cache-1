SubjectWe describe the clinical case of a 44 -year-old man already implanted with a dual-chamber closed loop stimulation (CLS) pacemaker (PM) and admitted to our department with an ECG showing ST elevation in the inferior leads. All examinations were negative and showed no abnormalities. After CLS-PM was reprogrammed in order to <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> spontaneous atrioventricular conduction, we found a complete normalization of ST segment. ConclusionAfter a careful analysis of admission ECG, ST elevation was interpreted as ventricular fusion due {{to the presence of}} a ventricular pacing artifact and the QRS complex being a hybrid of spontaneous and totally paced beats. Intermittent ST elevation, evident only during ventricular fusion should suggest secondary ventricular repolarization and not myocardial injury...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the dynamics of}} coupled cells connected so that the network {{may or may not}} have symmetries. Focusing on transitive (strongly connected) networks that have only one type of cell (identical cell networks) we address three questions relating the network structure to dynamics. The first question is how different structures of the network relate to and force the appearance of invariant subspaces (synchrony subspaces) associated with partitions (synchrony classes) for the network. The second question is how these invariant subspaces can <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> robust heteroclinic attractors in such networks even if their symmetries are not sufficient to force their appearance. The third question is how the dynamics of coupled cell networks of different structures and numbers of cells can be related; in particular we {{consider the}} sets of possible inflations of a coupled cell network that are obtained by replacing one cell by many of the same type, such that the original network dynamics is still present within a synchrony subspace. We illustrate the results with a number of examples of networks of up to six cells...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the heat {{interaction}} between a water column and sediments on the formation, development, and duration of existence of anaerobic zones in ice-covered lakes is estimated based on observational data from five frozen lakes located in northwestern Russia and North America. A simple one-dimensional model that describes the formation {{and development of the}} dissolved oxygen deficit in shallow ice-covered lakes is suggested. The model reproduces the main features of dissolved oxygen dynamics during the ice-covered period; that is, the vertical structure, the thickness, and the rate of increase of the anaerobic zone in bottom layers. The model was verified against observational data. The results from the verification show that the model adequately describes the dissolved oxygen dynamics in winter. The consumption rates of DO by bacterial plankton and by bottom sediments, which depend on the heat transfer through the water-sediment interface, are calculated.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we study}} {{quantities}} at infinity {{and the appearance}} of limit cycles from the equator in polynomial vector fields with no singular points at infinity. We start by proving the algebraic equivalence of the corresponding quantities at infinity (also focal values at infinity) for the system and its translational system, then we obtain that the maximum number of limit cycles that can appear at infinity is invariant for the systems by translational transformation. Finally, we compute the singular point quantities of a class of cubic polynomial system and its translational system, reach with relative ease expressions of the first five quantities at infinity of the two systems, then we prove that the two cubic vector fields perturbed identically can have five limit cycles simultaneously in the neighborhood of infinity and construct two systems that <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> five limit cycles respectively.

This method requires an incubation time of between 5 and 11 days to <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> foci after several rounds of viral infection. The following work presents a rapid Andes virus (ANDV) titration assay, based on viral nucleocapsid protein (N) detection in infected cells by flow cytometry. To this end, an anti-N monoclonal antibody was used that was developed and characterized previously. ANDV N could be detected as early as 6 h post-infection, while viral release was not observed until 24 - 48 h post-infection. Given that ANDV detection was performed during its first round of infection, a time reduction for titer determination was possible and provided results in only two days. The viral titer was calculated from the percentage of N positive cells and agreed with focus assay titers. Furthermore, the assay was applied to quantify the inhibition of ANDV cell entry by patient sera and by preventing endosome acidification. This novel hantavirus titration assay is a highly quantitative and sensitive tool that facilitates infectivity titration of virus stocks, rapid screening for antiviral drugs, and may be further used to detect and quantify infectious virus in human samples...|$|E

Despite its obvious advantages in terms of reduced costs, simplified training programs and flexibility, e-learning was not always the miracle solution.

The constant interest in researching and testing the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), eLearning and multimedia in the learning process led to educational imperatives about the indicators that can reveal the level of quality for teaching and management of the course. Modern eLearning solutions now recognize the importance of learning as a social process and offer possibilities for collaboration with other learners, for interaction with the learning content and for guidance from teachers, trainers and tutors. Our aim is to analyze the importance of using ICT in a “learning society”.
