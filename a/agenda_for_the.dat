5|$|In 1981, Lunney became {{manager of}} the space shuttle program, a {{high-level}} position where Lunney found himself responsible for setting the <b>agenda</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> developing program. His responsibilities were broad ones; they included supervising program planning, budgeting and scheduling; systems engineering; and mission planning. During the earlier shuttle flights he was even involved in determining whether the weather was suitable for launch, but in later years that responsibility was largely devolved to lower levels of the hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|The {{convention}} {{decided not}} to establish a formal association, but to exist as an annual convention with a standing committee to arrange its meetings, publish its proceedings, and execute adopted plans of action. Stone {{was appointed to the}} Central Committee of nine women and nine men. The following spring, she became secretary of the committee and, except for one year, retained that position until 1858. As secretary, Stone took a leading part in organizing and setting the <b>agenda</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> national conventions throughout the decade.|$|E
5|$|Sampson's <b>agenda</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1930 {{session was}} lost in the fights over Ben Johnson and Cumberland Falls. His calls for funding the free {{textbook}} program, compulsory sterilization of the mentally ill, and restrictions on chain stores were ignored. Instead, the legislature continued eroding his gubernatorial powers, including the power to appoint members of the textbook commission. With nearly all of the governor's powers stripped away and given to a three-person commission, Lieutenant Governor James Breathitt, Jr. became the de facto governor for the remainder of Sampson's term. The General Assembly pursued its own agenda, passing a mandatory driver's license law, a revised election law, and a sales tax on retail stores. They also allocated funding for the purchase of what would become Mammoth Cave National Park. Sampson vetoed 12 bills during the 1930 session, but the legislature overrode 11 of them.|$|E

5|$|The Permanent Secretariat, {{established}} at {{the seat of the}} League at Geneva, comprised a body of experts in various spheres {{under the direction of the}} general secretary. Its principal sections were Political, Financial and Economics, Transit, Minorities and Administration (administering the Saar and Danzig), Mandates, Disarmament, Health, Social (Opium and Traffic in Women and Children), Intellectual Cooperation and International Bureaux, Legal, and Information. The staff of the Secretariat was responsible for preparing the <b>agenda</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Council and the Assembly and publishing reports of the meetings and other routine matters, effectively acting as the League's civil service. In 1931 the staff numbered 707.|$|E
5|$|In 1198, Pope Innocent III {{broached}} {{the subject of}} a new crusade through legates and encyclical letters. The stated intent of the crusade was to conquer Egypt, now the centre of Muslim power in the Levant. The crusader army that arrived at Venice in the summer of 1202 was somewhat smaller than had been anticipated, and there were not sufficient funds to pay the Venetians, whose fleet was hired by the crusaders to take them to Egypt. Venetian policy under the ageing and blind but still ambitious Doge Enrico Dandolo was potentially at variance with that of the Pope and the crusaders, because Venice was closely related commercially with Egypt. The crusaders accepted the suggestion that in lieu of payment they assist the Venetians in the capture of the (Christian) port of Zara in Dalmatia (vassal city of Venice, which had rebelled and placed itself under Hungary's protection in 1186). The city fell in November 1202 after a brief siege. Innocent tried to forbid this political attack on a Christian city, but was ignored. Reluctant to jeopardise his own <b>agenda</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Crusade, he gave conditional absolution to the crusaders—not, however, to the Venetians.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns sends hired goons to the Simpson {{house in}} order to take Homer back to Mr. Burns' Manor to negotiate. While Mr. Burns is setting the <b>agenda</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> discussion, Homer is struck by the urgent need to use the rest room. Homer asks Mr. Burns where the rest room is and {{immediately}} leaves, leading Mr. Burns to conclude that Homer is a tough negotiator who is unwilling to even hear him out. At a later union meeting, Homer tries to resign, tired of meeting with Mr. Burns. The union misunderstands his frustration, and the members nearly unanimously decide to strike. Mr. Burns is undeterred by the strike and tries several methods of breaking it up, but fails. On an edition of Kent Brockman's talk show Smartline, Mr. Burns is allowed an opening tirade and he threatens dire events if the strike is not concluded.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} I explore the {{seemingly}} contradictory notion of citizenship <b>agendas</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> abject. While abjection suggests a casting off or expulsion, citizenship implies inclusion. The youth and security policies that I argue {{can be read}} as citizenship <b>agendas</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> abject evidence this contradiction and the concomitant ambiguity. This article focuses on the workings of the youth and security assemblage' in the Amsterdam South District. This policy assemblage primarily targets unruly' young Moroccan-Dutch men from Amsterdam's notorious Diamantbuurt. In Amsterdam and elsewhere in the Netherlands, such young men have been portrayed as the ultimate troublemakers who have made urban lives unsafe and terrorized' entire neighborhoods. Through an ethnographic analysis of a public event that brought together various members of the youth and security assemblage, this article examines the tensions and organized distrust that these citizenship <b>agendas</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> abject carry within them...|$|R
