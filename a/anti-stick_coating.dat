50|$|Lovebirds {{are also}} very active and love to chew things. When they are flying within a household, {{it is wise to}} watch them {{carefully}} and protect any furniture, electrical wiring or anything else that they could possibly chew on. Try to place fresh willow or oak branches in a favorite spot (e.g. near a high/sunny platform) to satisfy this natural behavior. Other things to be aware of when keeping lovebirds (also applies to other pet birds) at home are the danger spots in the house, such as open toilet bowls for drowning, clear glass walls which might be rammed in full force by the bird, fumes from all Teflon or <b>anti-stick</b> <b>coating</b> in the kitchen, microwave coatings, oven coatings and chemical fumes from regular household cleaning products. Interaction with other pets in the house must also be supervised, such as cats and dogs which may view the lovebird as a prey animal.|$|E
30|$|For P 2 P and R 2 P (using a flat mold) NIL processes, the micro/nanostructures are {{normally}} patterned onto rigid substrates such as silicon or quartz {{using conventional techniques}} (i.e., EBL) [3, 21, 22, 48] or even nanoimprint lithography [30], where the patterns are then etched into the substrate using reactive ion etching (RIE) {{to be used as}} a flat mold in the NIL process. Other techniques such as focused ion beam (FIB) was also explored by Taniguchi and the team [54] to fabricate molds for the NIL process, which was reported to be suitable for speedy fabrication of 3 D molds with a depth resolution down to 10 Â nm. To prevent the sticking issues from occurring during imprinting, the surface of the mold is usually coated with a thin layer of <b>anti-stick</b> <b>coating</b> such as fluorinated silanes [21, 55] or polybenzoxazine [56]. In some studies, the patterned resist layer is used directly as the mold surface (with or without <b>anti-stick</b> <b>coating)</b> without etching process as observed in the works of Mohamed [2] and Ishii and Taniguchi [57].|$|E
40|$|Another spinoff to {{the food}} {{processing}} industry involves a dry lubricant developed by General Magnaplate Corp. of Linden, N. J. Used in such spacecraft as Apollo, Skylab and Viking, the lubricant is a coating bonded to metal surfaces providing permanent lubrication and corrosion resistance. The coating lengthens equipment life and permits machinery to be operated at greater speed, thus increasing productivity and reducing costs. Bonded lubricants are used in scores of commercia 1 applications. They have proved particularly valuable to food processing firms because, while increasing production efficiency, they also help meet the stringent USDA sanitation codes for food-handling equipment. For example, a cookie manufacturer plagued production interruptions because sticky batter was clogging the cookie molds had the brass molds coated to solve the problem. Similarly, a pasta producer faced USDA action on a sanitation violation because dough was clinging to an automatic ravioli-forming machine; use of the <b>anti-stick</b> <b>coating</b> on the steel forming plates solved the dual problem of sanitation deficiency and production line downtime...|$|E
