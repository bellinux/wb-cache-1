6000|$|For {{it is true}} {{that the}} admirer of his work rather misses in him that intimation of a secret {{preference}} which many strong draughtsmen show, and which is not absent, for instance (I don't mean the secret, but the intimation), from the beautiful doings of Mr. Abbey. It is extremely present in Mr. Du Maurier's work, just as it was visible, less elusively, in that of John Leech, his predecessor in Punch. Mr. Abbey has a haunting type; Du Maurier has a haunting type. There was little perhaps of the haunted about Leech, but we know very well how he wanted his pretty girls, his British swell, and his [...] "hunting men" [...] to look. He betrayed a predilection; he had his little ideal. That an artist may be a great force and not have a little ideal, the scarcely too much to be praised Charles Keene is there (I mean he is in Punch) to show us. He has not a haunting type--not he--and I think that no one has yet discovered how he would have liked his pretty girls to look. He has kept the soft conception too much to himself--he has not trifled with the common truth by letting it appear. This common truth, in its innumerable combinations, is what Mr. Rein-hart also shows us (with of course infinitely less of a parti pris of laughing at it), though, as I must hasten to add, the female face and form in his hands always happen to take on a much lovelier cast than in Mr. Keene's. These things with him, however, are not a private predilection, an artist's dream. Mr. Reinhart is solidly an artist, but I doubt whether as yet he dreams, and the absence of private predilections makes him seem a little hard. He is sometimes rough with our average humanity, and especially rough with the feminine portion of it. He usually represents American life, in which that portion is often spoken of as showing to peculiar advantage. But Mr. Reinhart sees it generally, as very bourgeois. His good ladies are apt to be rather thick and short, rather huddled and plain. I shouldn't mind it so much if they didn't look so much alive. They are incontestably possible. The long, brilliant series of drawings he made to accompany Mr. Charles Dudley Warner's papers on the American watering-places form a rich bourgeois epic, which imaginations haunted by a type must accept with philosophy, for the sketches in question will have carried the tale, and all sorts of irresistible illusion with it, to the four corners of the earth. Full of observation and reality, of happy impressionism, taking all things as they come, with many a charming picture of youthful juxtaposition, they give us a sense, to which nothing need be added, of the energy of Mr. Reinhart's pencil. They are a final collection of pictorial notes on the manners and customs, the aspects and habitats, in July and August, of the great American democracy; of which, certainly, taking one thing with another, they give a very comfortable, cheerful account. But they confirm that <b>analytic</b> <b>view</b> of which I have ventured to give a hint--the view of Mr. Reinhart as an artist of immense capacity who yet somehow doesn't care. I must add that this aspect of him is modified, in the one case very gracefully, in the other by the operation of a sort of constructive humor, remarkably strong, in his illustrations of Spanish life and his sketches of the Berlin political world.|$|E

In addition, human communication is a prerequisite for members to work towards common group goals as opposed to individual interest when these elements are in conflict. Furthermore, we draw some links between the three levels of selection, and look at how they may influence each other. Master i læring i komplekse systeme...|$|R

30|$|KC theorists (Lave and Wenger 1991; Scardamalia and Bereiter 2014; Wenger 1998) regard {{newcomer}} integration as {{laying in}} the nature of social interactions and being essential for the economy of a community.

In consequence, members of media-based KCs may apply similar social interaction and communication strategies as in face-to-face settings, however adapting them to the mediated environment, e.g., by choosing more persistent media (or media features) to exchange and display the more persistent information, and less persistent but faster media for the negotiation of meaning (Dillenbourg and Traum 2006).|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} of phrasemes is problematic both in a lexicographic view and a corpus <b>analytic</b> <b>view,</b> {{even though the}} efforts of the collocation research provide enormous amounts of output.

The following text proposes some approaches, how dictionaries can be used as corpora, and shows, which results (examples, illustrations, links etc.) can be expected. The point of origin of the idea is to use dictionaries not in the classical way – that means: searching the headword and reading the related article –, but to use the whole dictionary as a corpus.

Critics of the article pointed out that Mulvey's argument implies the impossibility of the enjoyment of classical Hollywood cinema by women, and that her argument did not seem to take into account spectatorship not organised along normative gender lines. Mulvey addresses these issues in her later 1981 article, [...] "Afterthoughts on 'Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema' inspired by King Vidor's Duel in the Sun (1946)," [...] in which she argues a metaphoric 'transvestism' in which a female viewer might oscillate between a male-coded and a female-coded <b>analytic</b> <b>viewing</b> position.

When the viewing attitude changes from analytic to holistic, the term color scission means the phenomenal replacement of the single analytically perceived gray color of an area of the pattern with the two gray colors that are perceived in the same area when such area forms a transparent surface. The concept of color scission has been used by Moore Heider and Metelli to explain phenomenal transparency. An analysis of experimental results reported in the literature shows that color scission does not occur in transparent patterns formed by only three areas and that it involves incorrect predictions of the occurrence of transparency in patterns formed by four or more areas. It is concluded that in general the concept of color scission is inadequate to explain phenomenal transparency...|$|R

The thesis {{provides}} an <b>analytic</b> <b>view</b> {{of the music}} of indigenous people of Solomon Islands which is distinguished by its frequent use of polyphony.

When an analyst selects a syndromic hotspot, temporal statistical graphs of the hotspot are created.
