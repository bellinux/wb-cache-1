The case dragged on through 1910, delayed by Pilcher's inability to return from India to attend the court.

5|$|In Britain gay saunas were {{routinely}} raided by police {{up until the}} end of the 1980s (for example raids in May 1988 on Brownies in Streatham, the owner getting a six-month jail sentence and a £5,000 fine, and the Brooklyn House Hotel sauna in Manchester). By the 1990s, with increasing scrutiny of the costs of such operations (charges of gross indecency in a sauna normally needing the expense of undercover officers), a reduced likelihood of successful prosecution, concerns of being perceived as homophobic, and little public interest in victimless crime, gay saunas became free to operate without the risk of being raided by police. Also, police attitudes meant that they were more willing to turn <b>a</b> <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> because they preferred such activity to take place in a contained environment rather than outdoors even though users were still committing the homosexual sexual offence of gross indecency, until gross indecency was wiped from the statute books following the Sexual Offences Act 2003.|$|E

40|$|Platelet-derived {{growth factors}} (PDGFs) and their receptors (PDGFRs) make {{profound}} contributions to both physiology and pathology. While {{it is widely}} believed that direct (PDGF-mediated) activation is the primary mode of activating PDGFRs, the discovery that they can also be activated indirectly begs the question of the relevance of the indirect mode of activating PDGFRs. In the context of <b>a</b> <b>blinding</b> <b>eye</b> disease, indirect activation of PDGFR results in persistent signaling, which suppresses the level of p 53 and thereby promotes viability of cells that drive pathogenesis. Under the same conditions, PDGFR fails to undergo in-direct activation. In this paper, we report that RasGAP (GTPase-activating protein of Ras) prevented indirect activation of PDGFR. RasGAP, which associates with PDGFR but not PDGFR, reduced the level of mitochondrion-derived reactive oxy-gen species, which are required for enduring activation of PDGFRs. Furthermore, preventing PDGFR from associating with RasGAP allowed it to signal enduringly and drive pathogenesis of <b>a</b> <b>blinding</b> <b>eye</b> disease. These results indicate a previously un-appreciated role of RasGAP in antagonizing indirect activation of PDGFR, define the underlying mechanism, and raise the pos-sibility that PDGFR-mediated diseases involve indirect activation of PDGFR. The receptors for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) areessential for mouse development and are implicated in a vari-ety of human diseases (1, 2). Furthermore, these observations are the basis for the consensus that, while there may be overlap in what the twoPDGF receptors (PDGFRs), PDGFR and PDGFR...|$|R

The two moved in different social circles: Olga was the daughter of a wealthy Youngstown, Ohio, steel family, living in her mother's Parisian apartment on the Right Bank, socializing with aristocrats, while his friends were mostly impoverished writers of the Left Bank. They spent the following summer in the south of France, where Pound worked with George Antheil to apply the concept of Vorticism to music, and managed to write two operas, including Le Testament de Villon. He wrote pieces for solo violin, which Olga performed.|$|E

However, when Abi finds a present that Ben has got for Paul, she realises he has feelings for Paul and confides in Babe, who helps her to publicly announce that she is pregnant.

When Ben accompanies her to a doctor's appointment, she gets him {{out of the room and}} confesses her lie to the doctor, who encourages her to be honest, but she then tells Ben the baby is due in October. Abi plans to get pregnant by Ben, but when he admits he may have caught an STI from a stranger, she is unable to have sex with him, so Babe tells her to get pregnant by another man. Babe forces her into getting drunk, and after a drunk Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) compliments her, they have unprotected sex. However, Abi does not get pregnant. She decides to tell Ben the truth, but as she is about to do so, he tells her he has caught chlamydia. Abi later tests positive for chlamydia and realises that Lee may have caught it too. Abi panics to Babe that Ben will discover she is not pregnant, so during an argument between Ben and Phil, Babe pushes Abi into Ben as he is pushed by Phil, knocking her to the ground. Babe takes Abi away from the square, and on their return, Abi tells Ben she has had a miscarriage. When she later sees Ben being comforted by Paul, she feels uneasy.|$|E

However, a safer, nonviral, {{biocompatible}} lipid-based nanoparticle {{has never been}} tested to treat <b>blinding</b> <b>eye</b> diseases. We created an artificial virus using a nanoparticle, liposome-protamine-DNA complex (LPD), modified with a cell permeable peptide and a nuclear localization signaling (NLS) peptide, to deliver a functional gene for eye disease treatment. In the eye, a photochemical, 11 -cis-retinal, allows the visual pigment rhodopsin to absorb light in the visible range. Without the photochemical, we lose {{the ability to see}} light. Retinal pigment epithelium protein 65 (Rpe 65) is the key enzyme in regulating the availability of photochemical; deficiency of this gene results in <b>a</b> <b>blinding</b> <b>eye</b> disease. Here we show {{for the first time that}} LPD promotes efficient delivery in a cell specific-manner, and a long-term expression of Rpe 65 gene to mice lacking Rpe 65 gene, leading to in vivo correction of blindness. Thus, LPD nanoparticles could provide a promising, efficient, nonviral method of gene delivery with clinical applications in eye disease treatment...|$|R
