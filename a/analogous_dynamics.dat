40|$|Modelling {{the process}} of {{recombination}} leads to a large coupled nonlinear dynamical system. Here, we consider a particular case of recombination in discrete time, allowing only for single crossovers. While the <b>analogous</b> <b>dynamics</b> in continuous time admits a closed solution, this no longer works for discrete time. A more general model (i. e. without the restriction to single crossovers) has been studied before and was solved algorithmically by means of Haldane linearisation. Using the special formalism introduced by Baake and Baake (2003), we obtain further insight into the single-crossover dynamics and the particular difficulties that arise in discrete time. We then transform the equations to a solvable system in a two-step procedure: linearisation followed by diagonalisation. Still, the coefficients of the second step must be determined in a recursive manner, but once this is done for a given system, they allow for an explicit solution valid for all times. Comment: J.

40|$|Latent viruses {{generally}} {{defend their}} host cell against superinfection by nonlatent virulent mutants that could destroy the host cell. Superinfection inhibition thus {{seems to be}} a prerequisite for the maintenance of viral latency. Yet viral latency can break down when resistance to superinfection inhibition, known as ultravirulence, occurs. To understand the evolution of viral latency, we have developed a model that analyzes the epidemiology of latent infection in the face of ultravirulence. We show that latency can be maintained when superinfection inhibition and resistance against it coevolve in an arms race, which can result in large fluctuations in virulence. An example is the coevolution of the virulence and superinfection repressor protein of phage lambda (cI) and its binding target, the lambda oLoR operator. We show that this repressor/operator coevolution is the driving force for the evolution of superinfection immunity groups. Beyond latent phages, we predict <b>analogous</b> <b>dynamics</b> for any latent virus that uses a single repressor for the simultaneous control of virulence and superinfection...|$|E

40|$|Holographic photopolymers develop {{permanent}} index change via the polymerization {{and subsequent}} diffusion of monomer. It is well-known that to achieve high-fidelity recording, {{the rate of}} polymerization must be small {{in comparison to the}} rate of diffusion, particularly for strong exposures that consume significant fractions of the available monomer. When this condition is violated, polymerization is slowed in high-intensity regions by the local depletion of monomer, resulting in broadening of recorded features. This paper shows that a diffusing inhibitor has <b>analogous</b> <b>dynamics</b> controlled by the ratio of inhibitor diffusion rate to inhibition rate. When the ratio is small, inhibitor is locally depleted in bright regions, resulting in localized acceleration of polymerization. This causes recorded index features to be narrower than the incident optical exposure. Theoretical, numerical and experimental studies are used to illustrate this fact and show that this narrowing can be used to compensate for the broadening caused by monomer dynamics. Both effects are emphasized for rapid, strong recordings, suggesting that an inhibitor may be used to increase recording fidelity in this limit...|$|E

40|$|Above a {{critical}} surface chemistry-dependent particle loading associated with nanoscale interparticle spacing, ligand-ligand interactions-both electrostatic and steric-come into play and govern {{the structure and}} dynamics of charged oligomer-functionalized nanoparticle suspensions. We report in particular on the structure, ion transport, and rheology of suspensions of nanoparticle salts created by cofunctionalization of silica particles with tethered sulfonate salts and oligomers. Dispersion of the hairy ionic particles into medium and high dielectric constant liquids yields electrolytes with unique structure and transport properties. We find that electrostatic repulsion imparted by ion dissociation can be tuned to control the dispersion state and rheology through counterion size (i. e., Li+, Na+, and K+) and dielectric properties of the dispersing medium. Analysis of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) structure factors and the mechanical modulus shows that when the interparticle spacing approaches nanometer dimensions, weakly entangled anchored ligands experience strong and long-lived topological constraints analogous to those normally found in well-entangled polymeric fluids. This finding provides insight into the molecular origins of the surprisingly similar rubbery plateau moduli observed in hairy nanoparticle suspensions and entangled polymers of the same chemistry as the tethered ligands. Additionally, we find that a time-composition superposition (TCS) principle exists for the suspensions, {{which can be used}} to substantially extend the observation time over which dynamics are observed in jammed, soft glassy suspensions.

40|$|Human {{activity}} {{has resulted in}} the emergence of fire-induced forest-shrubland mosaics in many southern temperate forest landscapes. In New Zealand (NZ), this transformation was caused by the introduction of fire to previously very low fire-frequency ecosystems. High levels of seed and seedling predation by exotic mammals and the reduction of avian pollination and seed dispersal further influence vegetation change and can cause successions to become completely arrested. <b>Analogous</b> <b>dynamics</b> occur in many other Southern Hemisphere forest landscapes where changes in fire regimes and the introduction of mammalian herbivores and predators have resulted in forest-shrubland mosaics. We developed a spatially explicit state-and-transition model to disentangle the effects of altered fire regimes; invasive pyrophyllic shrub species; seed and seedling predation by exotic mammals; and lowered rates of long-distance seed movement on long-term landscape dynamics and state transitions. Our modelling highlights a threshold in fire frequency where forest systems move to a fire-induced early-successional shrubland state. Because early-successional vegetation in NZ and many other southern temperate forests is much more flammable than mature late-successional vegetation, this shrubland state will persist until fire is suppressed. Our modelling suggests also that in the absence of fire there are critical thresholds in seed predation beyond which succession may become completely arrested in a mid-successional state. Even moderate levels of predation slow regeneration and move the tipping point at which forests shift to early-successional shrublands in the direction of less frequent fire. The presence of invasive pyrophyllic shrubs in the landscape also influences the location of thresholds in fire frequency at which state shifts occur. Restoring these landscapes to their formerly forested condition will require the removal of fire as well as mammalian seed/ling predators and the reinstatement of pollination and dispersal services. Removal of seed predators may act as an effective component of fire control by allowing secondary successions to proceed more quickly, thereby reducing landscape-level flammability...|$|E

Having constructed the Malmquist indices, using data provided by Bank Indonesia (the Indonesian central bank), for the banking industry and different bank types (i. e., listed and Islamic) and groupings, we then decomposed the industry’s Malmquist into its technical efficiency change and frontier shift components. Finally, we analysed the banks’ risk management performance, using Simar and Wilson’s (2007) truncated regression approach, before assessing its impact on productivity growth. The {{first part of the}} Malmquist analysis showed that average productivity changes for the Indonesian banking industry tended to be driven, over the sample period, by technological progress rather than by frontier shift, although a relatively stable pattern was exhibited for most of the period. However, {{at the beginning of the}} considered period, state-owned and foreign banks, as well as Islamic banks, exhibited volatile productivity movements, mainly caused by shifts in the technological frontier. With respect to the risk management analysis, most of the balance sheet variables were shown to have had the expected impact on risk management efficiency. While the risk management decomposition of technical efficiency change and frontier risk components demonstrated that, by the end of the sample period, the change in risk management efficiency and risk management effects had the same dynamic pattern, resulting in the <b>analogous</b> <b>dynamics</b> for technical efficiency changes. Therefore, a strategy based on the gradual adoption of newer technology, with a particular focus on internal risk management enhancement, seems to offer the highest potential for boosting the productivity of the financial intermediary operations of Indonesian banks...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma) are a facultatively {{anadromous}} salmonid common around much of {{the north}} Pacific Rim, but little is known {{of the factors that}} determine their migration and life-history patterns. In the Chignik Lakes system on the Alaska Peninsula, Dolly Varden are the only large bodied resident fish species and use nearly all available aquatic habitats at different life stages. In addition, they are often the numerical dominant fish in both freshwater and estuarine habitats. I employed a multifaceted approach to understand variation in Dolly Varden migration timing, growth, habitat use, and variation in anadromy. By integrating daily counts of Dolly Varden ascending rivers and streams throughout the migratory range over a wide temporal scale, I determined upstream migration generally occurs earlier in southern stream and later in northern streams. Interannual variation in ascent timing in southern streams is correlated with sea-surface temperatures, while in northern streams it was not. Plasma insulin-like growth factor 1 concentrations indicate rapid summer growth in estuarine waters compared to freshwater lake habitats. However, the growth benefits of discrete sub-regions of the estuary vary by month. Muscle tissue stable isotope analyses of carbon and nitrogen indicate non-overlapping isotopic signatures of Dolly Varden captured at each estuary sub-region. Therefore there is behavioral spatial separation among estuarine Dolly Varden despite broadly similar body size and diet across the estuarine habitat. Finally, I employed otolith microchemistry (Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca) to evaluate the lifetime migratory history of 366 Dolly Varden captured throughout the watershed. Nearly all Dolly Varden migrate to sea at least once in their life, with most doing so at age four. However, after age four migration rates decline, to near zero by age seven. Fully resident individuals exist within marine-accessible portions of the watershed, and comprise almost 15 % of fish over age six. These data demonstrate that Dolly Varden exhibit wide diversity in movement behavior among and within watersheds. These patterns change with ontogeny, and are likely shaped by the size-specific costs and benefits of alternative habitat use and resource availability. <b>Analogous</b> <b>dynamics</b> likely drive life-history diversity in many iteroparous, facultatively anadromous species...|$|E
