5|$|Operation Market Garden was an {{airborne}} assault by three {{divisions in the}} Netherlands in September 1944, including the British 1st and the American 82nd and 101st, to secure key bridges and towns along the expected Allied axis of advance. Farthest north, 1st Airborne, supported by the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade, landed at Arnhem to secure bridges across the Nederrijn. Initially expecting an easy advance, XXX Corps, under Lieutenant General Brian Horrocks, to reach the <b>airborne</b> <b>force</b> at Arnhem within two to three days.|$|E
5|$|Commanded by Generalmajor Richard Heidrich, the 1st Parachute Division {{consisted}} of the 1st, 3rd and 4th Parachute Regiments, with an artillery regiment, tank-destroyer, anti-aircraft, and engineer battalions, and other support units. The division was the successor of the original German <b>airborne</b> <b>force,</b> the 7th Air Division, and was highly experienced. It had spearheaded the German invasion in the west in 1940, and fought in the battles of Greece and Crete, and in the Soviet Union. Withdrawn from the Soviet Union in 1943, the division had already fought against British paratroops during operations in Sicily. However, on 9 September only three combat battalions and the headquarters were in Apulia.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Airborne Division was an {{airborne}} {{infantry division}} of the British Army during the Second World War. The division was formed in late 1941 during World War II, after the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, demanded an <b>airborne</b> <b>force,</b> and was initially under command of Major-General Frederick A. M. Browning. The division {{was one of two}} airborne divisions raised by the British Army during the war, with the other being the 6th Airborne Division, created in May 1943, using former units of the 1st Airborne Division.|$|E
50|$|The Defense Companies were {{initially}} trained by Soviet Spetsnaz special <b>forces,</b> VDV <b>airborne</b> <b>forces,</b> and the Soviet Army Tank Corps. They had regular Soviet advisors and conducted frequent war games and field exercises with the Soviet Army. Their expertise lay in Soviet-style combined arms operations involving armour, mechanized, artillery, and <b>airborne</b> <b>forces.</b> Defense Companies commanders {{were known to}} be personally close to several high-ranking Soviet military officials, like Vassily Margelov and Dmitri Sukhorukov, commanders of the VDF <b>Airborne</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1941, the <b>Airborne</b> <b>Forces</b> Establishment {{was created}} from the {{experimental}} and technical units, renamed in 1942 as the <b>Airborne</b> <b>Forces</b> Experimental Establishment. The Parachute Training Squadron became a unit {{in its own}} right as the Parachute Training School on 15 February 1942.|$|R
5000|$|The {{creation}} of the post-war Soviet <b>Airborne</b> <b>Forces</b> owe much {{to the efforts of}} one man, Army General Vasily Margelov, {{so much so that the}} abbreviation of VDV in the <b>Airborne</b> <b>Forces</b> is sometimes waggishly interpreted as [...] "Войска дяди Васи", [...] "Uncle Vasya's Troops".|$|R
5|$|The {{success of}} the first British {{airborne}} raid, Operation Colossus, prompted the War Office to expand the <b>airborne</b> <b>force</b> {{through the creation of}} the Parachute Regiment, and to develop plans to convert several infantry battalions into parachute and glider battalions. On 31 May 1941, a joint Army and RAF memorandum was approved by the Chiefs-of-Staff and Winston Churchill; it recommended that the British airborne forces should consist of two parachute brigades, one based in England and the other in the Middle East, and that a glider force of 10,000 men should be created.|$|E
5|$|Although Tito's headquarters, {{along with}} several other Partisan organisations, was {{temporarily}} disrupted and key staff were lost during the operation, all Partisan organisations were quickly re-located and resumed operation. Drvar reverted to Partisan control {{within a few weeks}} of the operation. The operation was a failure, as Tito, his principal headquarters staff and the allied military personnel escaped, despite their presence in Drvar {{at the time of the}} airborne assault. The operation failed due to a number of factors, including Partisan resistance in the town itself and along the approaches to Drvar. The failure of the various German intelligence agencies to share the limited intelligence available on Tito's exact location also contributed to the unsuccessful outcome for the Germans, and this failure to share intelligence was compounded by a lack of contingency planning by the commander of the German <b>airborne</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, Browning {{travelled}} to the United States, {{where he}} toured airborne training facilities with his American counterpart, Major General William C. Lee. Browning's tendency to lecture the Americans on airborne warfare made him few friends among the Americans, {{who felt that}} the British were still novices themselves. Browning was envious of the Americans' equipment, particularly the C-47 Dakota transports. On returning to the United Kingdom, he arranged for a joint exercise to be conducted with the 2nd Battalion, 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment (2/503). In mid–September, as the 1st Airborne Division was coming close to reaching full strength, Browning was informed that Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa, would take place in November. When {{he found that the}} 2/503, was to take part, Browning argued that a larger <b>airborne</b> <b>force</b> should be utilised, as the vast distances and comparatively light opposition would provide opportunities for airborne operations.|$|E

It deployed {{aircraft and}} crews to France and England, October 1965 - March 1967 and to Panama Canal Zone, March-June 1967. It provided intra-theater airlift {{and support of}} U.S. Army <b>airborne</b> <b>forces</b> from 1971 to 1973.|$|R

5|$|The Allied {{invasion}} of Southern France during the Second World War {{was given the}} code name Operation Dragoon. It would {{take place in the}} South of France, between Cannes and Toulon in August 1944. The landings would be undertaken by the U.S. Seventh Army, with the French First Army landing after the beachhead was secure. Following the success of the Normandy airborne landings, Allied planners wanted to use an <b>airborne</b> <b>force</b> to support the invasion. However the divisions in Europe, the American 82nd and 101st Airborne Division, had participated in the Normandy landings and were refitting for further operations to support the advance in France and the Low Countries. The two British divisions were also unavailable; the 1st Airborne Division was preparing for operations in Northern Europe and the 6th Airborne Division was still fighting in Normandy.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of {{extensive}} training, the <b>airborne</b> <b>force</b> took off in two aircraft–glider combinations {{on the night of}} 19 November 1942. Both managed to reach the Norwegian coast, but neither was able to reach their objective. The first pair suffered from navigational difficulties and severe weather, which resulted in the tow rope snapping and the first glider crash–landing, with its towing aircraft returning to base; three airborne troops were killed outright, with the survivors captured shortly after the crash. The second pair fared even worse, with both aircraft and glider crashing into a mountain for unknown reasons; the aircrew and some airborne troops were killed outright, and those who survived were taken prisoner. None survived for very long, being executed as a result of Adolf Hitler's Commando Order, which stated all Commando personnel were to be immediately executed upon capture. At the end of the war, Wehrmacht personnel were tried and condemned to death for their part in the executions.|$|E
5|$|Operation Freshman was the codename {{given to}} a British {{airborne}} operation conducted in November 1942 during World War II. It was the first British airborne operation conducted using gliders, and its target was the Vemork Norsk Hydro chemical plant in Telemark, Norway which produced heavy water for Nazi Germany. By 1942, the German nuclear weapons programme had come close {{to being able to}} develop a nuclear reactor, but in order for the reactor to function it would require a great deal of heavy water. The source of the heavy water was the Norsk Hydro plant, which had been occupied in 1940; when the British government learned of the German nuclear developments, it was decided that a raid would be launched to destroy the plant and deny the Germans the heavy water required to develop a nuclear weapon. Several tactics were discussed and discarded as impractical, and it was finally decided that a small <b>airborne</b> <b>force</b> composed of sappers from the Royal Engineer units attached to 1st Airborne Division would land by glider a short distance from the plant, demolish it with explosives and then escape over the Norwegian border into Sweden.|$|E

5|$|Operation Rösselsprung was a coup de main operation, {{involving}} {{direct action}} {{by a combined}} parachute and glider-borne assault by the 500th SS Parachute Battalion and a planned subsequent link-up with ground forces of the XV Mountain Corps converging on Drvar. The airborne assault was preceded by heavy bombing of the town by the Luftwaffe. The ground forces included Home Guard forces of the Independent State of Croatia. Tito, his principal headquarters staff and the Allied military personnel escaped, despite their presence in Drvar {{at the time of}} the airborne assault. The operation failed due to a number of factors, including Partisan resistance in the town itself and along the approaches to Drvar. The failure of the various German intelligence agencies to share the limited intelligence available on Tito's exact location and the lack of contingency planning by the commander of the German <b>airborne</b> <b>force</b> also contributed to the unsuccessful outcome for the Germans.|$|E
5|$|General Eisenhower had {{reviewed}} the airborne role in Operation Husky, and {{had concluded that}} large-scale formations were too difficult to control in combat to be practical. Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair, commander of Army Ground Forces, had similar misgivings: once an airborne supporter, he had been greatly disappointed by their performance in North Africa and, more recently, Sicily. However, other high-ranking officers believed otherwise, notably the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, George Marshall. He persuaded Eisenhower {{to set up a}} review board and to withhold judgement on the effectiveness of divisional-sized airborne forces until a large-scale maneuver could be tried in December. When Swing returned to the United States to resume command of the 11th Airborne Division in mid-September 1943, he had an additional role. McNair ordered him to form a committeethe Swing Board–composed of U.S. Army Air Forces, parachute and glider infantry, and artillery officers to arrange a large-scale maneuver that would effectively decide the fate of the divisional-sized <b>airborne</b> <b>force.</b> As the 11th Airborne Division was in reserve in the United States, and had not yet been earmarked for overseas shipment, the Swing Board chose it as the test formation; it would be opposed by a composite combat team from the 17th Airborne Division with a battalion from the 541st Parachute Infantry Regiment temporarily attached. The maneuver would also provide both divisions with further airborne training, as had occurred several months previously in a large-scale maneuver undertaken by the 82nd and the 101st Airborne Divisions.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} {{was part}} of 1st Parachute Brigade, which by mid-1942 had been expanded into 1st Airborne Division {{under the command of}} Major-General F.A.M. Browning. In July 1942 the 1st Parachute Battalion was selected to participate in the Dieppe Raid, and got as far as being loaded onto transport aircraft before poor weather cancelled the operation; when the raid was planned for a second time the parachute battalion was removed because their deployment was too dependent on there being good weather {{on the day of the}} raid. In midSeptember, as 1st Airborne Division was coming close to reaching full strength, Browning was informed that Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, would take place in November. After being informed that an American airborne unit, the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion, was to be used during the invasion, Browning successfully advocated for the 1st Parachute Brigade to also be included. He argued that a larger <b>airborne</b> <b>force</b> should be utilised during the invasion, as the large distances and comparatively light opposition would provide a number of opportunities for airborne operations. The War Office and CommanderinChief, Home Forces were won over by the argument, and agreed to detach the brigade from 1st Airborne Division and place it under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would command all Allied troops participating in the invasion. After it had been brought to full operational strength, partly by crossposting personnel from the newlyformed 2nd Parachute Brigade, and had been provided with sufficient equipment and resources, the brigade departed for North Africa at the beginning of November 1942.|$|E

25|$|In 1941, the British <b>airborne</b> <b>forces</b> {{were being}} raised and needed an {{artillery}} formation, so the battery was renamed the 1st Airlanding Light Battery {{and it was}} converted into an airborne unit.

50|$|The JADTEU traces {{its history}} to the Army's <b>Airborne</b> <b>Forces</b> Development Centre and the RAF's <b>Airborne</b> <b>Forces</b> Tactical Development Unit.

It was renamed Joint Air Transport Evaluation Unit (JATEU) in 1998.|$|R
5|$|A {{training}} establishment for parachute troops {{was set up}} at RAF Ringway, near Manchester, on 21 June 1940 and named the Central Landing Establishment, and the initial 500 volunteers began training for airborne operations. A number of gliders were being designed and constructed by the Royal Air Force, which had also provided a number of Armstrong Whitworth Whitley medium bombers for conversion into transport aircraft. Organizational plans were also being laid down, with the War Office calling for two parachute brigades to be operational by 1943. However, the immediate development of any further airborne formations, {{as well as the}} initial 500 volunteers already training, was hampered by three problems. With the threat of invasion in 1940, many War Office officials and senior British Army officers did not believe that sufficient men could be spared from the effort to the rebuild the Army after the Battle of France to create an effective airborne force; many believed that such a force would only have a nuisance raiding value and would not affect the conflict in any useful way. There were also material problems; all three of the armed services were expanding and rebuilding, particularly the Army, and British industry had not yet been organised to a sufficient war footing to support all three services as well as the fledgling <b>airborne</b> <b>force.</b> Finally, the airborne forces lacked a single, coherent policy, with no clear idea as to how they should be organised, or whether they should come under the command of the Army or the RAF; interorganizational rivalry between the War Office and the Air Ministry, in charge of the RAF, was a major factor in delaying the further expansion of British airborne forces.|$|E
5|$|Browning was {{shortly after}} {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} Major General, and he then supervised the newlyformed division as it underwent a prolonged of expansion and intensive training, with new brigades being raised and then assigned to the division and even more new equipment being tested. By midApril 1942 the division was able to conduct a smallscale airborne exercise {{for the benefit of the}} Prime Minister, in which twentyone transport aircraft and nine gliders participated, and by late December the division had been brought up to full strength. In midSeptember, as the division was coming close to reaching full strength, Browning was informed that Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, would take place in November. After being informed that the 2nd Battalion of the American 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment was to take part in the campaign, he argued that a larger <b>airborne</b> <b>force</b> should be utilised during the invasion, as the large distances and comparatively light opposition would provide a number of opportunities for airborne operations. The War Office and CommanderinChief, Home Forces were won over by the argument, and agreed to detach 1st Parachute Brigade from 1st Airborne Division and place it under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would command all Allied troops participating in the invasion. The Air Ministry was unable to provide transport aircraft or aircrews to operate with the brigade, so the United States Army Air Forces took over this responsibility, providing 60 Group of 51 Wing which flew Douglas C-47 Dakotas. A practice drop was conducted with a unit from the brigade on 9 October, although a lack of American familiarity with British airborne equipment and parachuting technique, as well a lack of British familiarity with the Dakota, led to three men being killed; this meant a delay in training whilst new techniques were developed, which in turn resulted in the majority of the brigade's personnel travelling to North Africa without having conducted a training drop from a Dakota. After it had been brought to full operational strength, partly by crossposting personnel from the newlyformed 2nd Parachute Brigade, and had been provided with sufficient equipment and resources, the brigade departed for North Africa at the beginning of November.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} for the 11th as the attacking {{force was}} to capture Knollwood Army Auxiliary Airfield near Fort Bragg in North Carolina, {{after which the}} maneuver was named. The defending forces were to try to defend the airport {{and the surrounding area}} and repel the airborne assault. The entire operation would be observed by Lieutenant General McNair. His observations and reports to the U.S. War Department, and ultimately General Eisenhower, would do much to decide {{the success or failure of}} the exercise. The Knollwood Maneuver took place on the night of 7 December, with the troops of the 11th Airborne Division being delivered to thirteen separate objectives by 200 C-47 Dakota transport aircraft and 234 Waco CG-4A gliders, with eighty-five percent of the airborne troops being delivered to their target without navigational error. The transport aircraft were divided into four groups, each taking off from a different airfield in the Carolinas, with two groups dropping paratroopers and two towing gliders, and between them deployed 4,800 airborne troops in the first wave. These airborne troops then seized the Knollwood Army Auxiliary Airfield from the defending troops and secured the area in which the rest of the division landed, all before daylight. Having secured their initial objectives, the 11th Airborne Division then conducted a coordinated ground attack against a reinforced infantry regiment, as well as several aerial resupply and casualty evacuation missions in coordination with transport aircraft. The exercise was judged to be a great success by those who observed it. McNair reported that the success of the maneuver pleased him, and highlighted the great improvements in airborne training that had occurred in the months between the end of Operation Husky and the Knollwood Maneuver. Due to the success of the units of the 11th Airborne Division during the exercise, the divisional-sized <b>airborne</b> <b>force</b> was deemed to be effective and was allowed by Eisenhower to remain.|$|E

5|$|There {{were few}} {{airborne}} {{resources available to}} the British Army by mid-1941. The only unit trained and available for an airborne operation was No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion, {{there were very few}} transport aircraft available to transport an <b>airborne</b> <b>force,</b> there were few RAF flight crews with experience of parachute droppings and none with operational experience, and there were no specialized overseas facilities to cater exclusively for airborne operations. However, it had been decided that some form of airborne operation would have to be carried out. The reasons for mounting an operation with such meagre resources were two-fold; firstly a successful raid would demonstrate {{to the rest of the}} world that Britain was still a force to be reckoned with and had not been defeated, and secondly a raid would test the fighting ability of the battalion and its equipment, as well as the RAF's ability to deliver paratroopers at a predetermined location at a required time. The target chosen for the operation was an aqueduct that crossed the Tragino river in the Campania province of southern Italy near the town of Calitri. The aqueduct carried the main water supply for the province of Apulia, which at the time was inhabited by approximately two million Italians and included the strategically important port of Taranto; it was hoped that destroying the aqueduct and depriving the population of their regular water supply would damage their morale, and also have some impact on the Italian war efforts in North Africa and Albania. The aqueduct was a significant distance from the Italian coast, making it unlikely that a sea-borne raiding party could reach it, and it was believed that it was too strongly constructed to be destroyed by aerial bombing; as such, an airborne raid conducted by parachute troops was thought to be the ideal way to eliminate the aqueduct.|$|E

Serving in divisions of infantry, armour and a fledgling <b>airborne</b> <b>force,</b> they fought on three continents in Africa, Europe and Asia.|$|E
25|$|Requiring Milburn to wait {{stemmed from}} Ridgway's not yet having given the final {{green light to}} the {{airborne}} landing, Operation Tomahawk, as of March 21. Operation Tomahawk would take place only if Ridgway received assurances that weather conditions on March 23 would favor a parachute drop, and that ground troops could link up with the <b>airborne</b> <b>force</b> within twenty-four hours. If these assurances were forthcoming, the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team, with the 2d and 4th Ranger Companies attached, was to drop in the Munsan-ni area {{on the morning of}} March 23 and block Route 1. Milburn was to establish physical contact with and assume control of the <b>airborne</b> <b>force</b> once it was on the ground. At the same time, he was to open a general corps advance toward line Aspen, which traced the lower bank of the Imjin River west and north of Munsan-ni, then sloped eastward across the corps zone to cut Routes 33 and 3 eight miles (12km) north of Uijongbu. Once on Aspen, Milburn was to expect Ridgway's order to continue to line Benton, the final COURAGEOUS objective line, some ten miles (16km) farther north. Reaching Benton would carry the I Corps virtually to the 38th parallel except in the west where the final line fell off to the southwest along the Imjin.|$|E
