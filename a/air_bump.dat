6000|$|What is {{the secret}} of the feat? No one explains. It cannot be {{physical}} strength, for that could not drive such a feather-weight any distance. It must be art. But no one explains what the art of it is; nor how it gets around that law of nature which says you shall not throw any two-ounce thing 220 yards, either through the <b>air</b> or <b>bumping</b> along the ground. Rev. J. G. Woods says: ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2008 Adult Swim {{launched}} a nationwide casting call contest, sponsored by Burger King, whose winner {{would get to}} appear as a live-action version of Carl. The search began in July 2008 in San Diego, California during the San Diego Comic-Con, where contestants dressed as Carl performed their auditions. Fans also sent in application videos to the Adult Swim website. Willis stated {{in an interview that}} several people were turned down for the role, including Kyle Gass of Tenacious D and Samuel L. Jackson; the winner David Long, Jr. from Ebensburg, Pennsylvania.

50|$|On February 22, 1992, {{at around}} 9:30 am, Bochatay was warming {{up with a}} teammate, Pierre Yves-Jorand and US Skiers Jeff Hamilton, Jimbo Morgan and Dale Womack when he crashed into a snowcat used to groom snow on a public slope.

50|$|Lying {{between the}} Spring Mountain {{appellation}} {{and the cold}} ocean current is {{a gap in the}} coastal mountains between Bodega and Tomales Bay and extending through the Santa Rosa Plain. Summer heat in the interior of California creates a low pressure area that draws cold air from the coast through this coastal gap and across the broad Santa Rosa plain. This on-shore <b>air</b> movement is <b>bumped</b> north by Sonoma Mountain pushing the cold air flow towards Santa Rosa Creek, the Northern Mayacamas Mountains, and directly at the Spring Mountain District AVA. The ridge of the Spring Mountain District is lower than Bald Mountain to its south and Diamond Mountain to its north. This lower ridgeline allows the cool, moist coastal air to enter the Napa Valley spilling down over forest and the vineyards that lie on the slopes of Spring Mountain and moderating peak daily temperatures.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper and {{presentation}} is for fun, enjoyment and education. Also, this should prove helpful to people who deal with any level of aerophobia – the abnormal and persistent fear of flying. This activity will add greater detail to all who travel on airliners. As the five senses of our body feed information to our mind about the activities and events that take place in commercial air travel, each person processes this information differently. For a knowledgeable or unconcerned air traveler such activities and events add little or no stress. However, to someone who knows little about the activities and events of <b>air</b> travel each <b>bump,</b> noise, unusual smell, pressure change, light flicker, other aircraft movement seen out the window, mechanical noise, public address announcements, aircraft attitude changes, runway/taxi or gate delays, et cetera, all of this adds stress and concern. Sometimes stress and concern becomes irrational and cause fear and panic to people in this people-filled environment not sympathetic to outbreaks of fear or panic attacks. Most people are able to control their composure, but continue to internally deal wit...|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} opens with CL in a cafe {{with her boyfriend}} (Song Jae-rim). CL's boyfriend breaks it off, telling her not to mess with him anymore or else he'd kill her, and then gets up to leave. CL wants him to stay and grabs his hand, but he lets go and leaves. A distressed CL puts her glasses on, bumps into a girl, then accidentally bangs into a door. Minzy is waiting for her outside in her car, then CL drives off. It begins to rain and CL throws a {{relationship}} ring out of the car. In the chorus, CL is at the racetrack getting ready to race and sees her ex-boyfriend who is also wearing a race uniform with a new girl. The two race against each other but her ex-boyfriend wins, because she hesitated when he almost crashed into her. Intercut in the race are scenes of Dara and Bom. The next chorus shows Dara drinking with a devastated CL with Minzy outside the cafe standing in rain with an umbrella. Next all of the members are playing in a band in a garage with Bom playing the keyboard, Minzy on the drums, CL on the microphone, and Dara on the guitar. The next scene shows a drunk CL going {{to the house of}} her ex-boyfriend. CL knocks on the door and her ex-boyfriend tries to ignore her. CL gets angry and kicks the door. Her ex-boyfriend opens the door and drags her away where he slaps her and pushes her. CL falls to the ground and gets a bruise on her cheek. When he leaves, the other members come and help her get up. In the third chorus, CL has come to the racetrack again with an obvious bruise on her cheek and races against her ex-boyfriend again. At the last minute of the race, with tears on her face, CL bumps her ex-boyfriend's car and they both push against each other. CL's black car flies into the <b>air</b> then <b>bumps</b> into her ex-boyfriend's car again. The cars explode and start a fire. In the last scene, CL is re-covered and standing with the other members, dressed in black, looking at the car. They all turn and comfort CL, smiling as they walk away.|$|R
60|$|At {{no great}} {{distance}} lay the little city {{which had been}} handed over {{to us by the}} French Government for a naval base, one of the ports where our troops and supplies are landed. Those who know provincial France will visualize its narrow streets and reticent shops, its grey-white and ecru houses all more or less of the same design, with long French windows guarded by ornamental balconies of cast iron--a city that has never experienced {{such a thing as a}} real-estate boom. Imagine, against such a background, the bewildering effect of the dynamic presence of a few regiments of our new army! It is a curious commentary on this war that one does not think of these young men as soldiers, but as citizens engaged in a scientific undertaking of a magnitude unprecedented. You come unexpectedly upon truck-loads of tanned youngsters, whose features, despite flannel shirts and campaign hats, summon up memories of Harvard Square and the Yale Yard, of campuses at Berkeley and Ithaca. The youthful drivers of these camions are alert, intent, but a hard day's work on the docks by no means suffices to dampen the spirits of the passengers, who whistle ragtime <b>airs</b> as they <b>bump</b> over the cobbles. And the note they strike is presently sustained by a glimpse, on a siding, of an efficient-looking Baldwin, ranged alongside several of the tiny French locomotives of yesterday; sustained, too, by an acquaintance with the young colonel in command of the town. Though an officer of the regular army, he brings home to one the fact that the days of the military martinet have gone for ever. He is military, indeed-erect and soldierly--but fortune has amazingly made him a mayor and an autocrat, a builder, and in some sense a railway-manager and superintendent of docks. And to these functions have been added those of police commissioner, of administrator of social welfare and hygiene. It will be a comfort to those at home to learn that their sons in our army in France are cared for as no enlisted men have ever been cared for before.|$|R
