India {{went on to win}} after starting the tournament as outsiders. Karthik kept his place in the Indian squad for the home ODI series against Australia but was on the outer after his decline in form in England, and played in only the final match in Mumbai, making <b>a</b> <b>duck</b> as India scraped home by two wickets.|$|E

5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released in November 1974. In the game, ducks fly {{one at a}} time across the screen, and the player shoots at them using a light gun attached to the game cabinet. The player gets three shots per duck; ducks change direction away from missed shots and fall {{to the bottom of the}} screen when hit. A screen overlay adds images of reeds and a tree branch, and an image of <b>a</b> <b>duck</b> is added to a row at the top of the screen whenever <b>a</b> <b>duck</b> is hit. Games continue until a time limit, set by the machine operator, is reached.|$|E
5|$|After making <b>a</b> <b>duck</b> {{against the}} Marylebone Cricket Club, {{which was a}} dress {{rehearsal}} for the Tests as the MCC fielded a virtual England team, Woodfull scored an unbeaten 98 against Cambridge University before running out of partners. He added 69 against the South of England and 100 against Middlesex and entered the Tests with 653 runs on tour {{at an average of}} 59.36.|$|E
5|$|After making <b>a</b> <b>duck</b> in {{the first}} innings of the match between Tasmania and the touring Australian side in March 1930, members of the Australian side advised Nash to change his stance, stating {{that it was too}} unorthodox to be successful.

5|$|Harvey was {{appointed}} to captain an Australian XI in a warm-up match against the touring Englishmen, indicating that the selectors were considering him for the Test captaincy. Harvey scored <b>a</b> <b>duck</b> and 38 and the Australians lost heavily by 345 runs on a wicket with a crater. Therefore, Benaud was made Australian captain ahead of Harvey.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test at Nottingham Harvey scored 64 {{and three}} in a rain-affected draw. He then made <b>a</b> <b>duck</b> and ten as Australia took the series lead in the Second Test at Lord's.

5|$|The pintail or {{northern}} pintail (Anas acuta) is <b>a</b> <b>duck</b> with wide geographic distribution that breeds {{in the northern}} areas of Europe, Asia and North America.

5|$|This was {{followed}} by home series against the West Indies in 1930–31, the first Test tour of Australia by the Caribbean side. Ahead of the Tests, Victoria defeated the tourists by an innings and 254, but Woodfull was unable to score any runs against his Test opponents, making <b>a</b> <b>duck.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Lord's, however, {{his form}} tailed away considerably: tormented by Australia's seam-bowling attack, his {{scores for the}} rest of the series were 13, 0 and 4, and 24 and 1, {{bringing}} his batting average for the five-match series down to 27.78. Collingwood's difficulties with the bat seemed to affect his usually high-class catching, and he dropped three chances of varying degrees of difficulty on the final day of the series at the Oval, though he did take a sharp catch to dismiss Mitchell Johnson for <b>a</b> <b>duck</b> off Steve Harmison as part of England's surge to a 197-run victory in the match, and a 2–1 victory in the series.|$|E

5|$|After {{struggling}} {{in recent months}} in the limited overs format, Karthik bounced back during the Challenger Trophy {{at the start of}} the Indian domestic season. Playing for India Blue, he made <b>a</b> <b>duck</b> in the first match, but then made 65 against India Green and an unbeaten 116 in the final to guide his team through a successful run-chase against India Red. He then rounded off his preparation for the next Test series with consecutive fifties for Tamil Nadu in the Ranji Trophy.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} {{of the rest of the}} 200203 season, Karthik began to make an {{imposing}} case for senior selection. In his opening match of the season for the Tamil Nadu Under-19s, he scored 227 in his team’s 392/7 against Goa, and after making <b>a</b> <b>duck</b> in the first innings against Hyderabad, he hit 126 not out in the second innings. He then registered his third century in four innings, cracking 235 against Andhra Pradesh. His form tapered off and he only made 111 runs in his next six innings, but was nevertheless called up to the senior team to make his first-class debut.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{made two}} {{changes for the}} Test. Harvey {{replaced}} the injured Barnes, while Saggers replaced Tallon behind the stumps. Tallon's little left finger had swelled up after the Third Test and he exacerbated the injury during a tour match against Middlesex. England made three changes. Emmett was dropped after making 10 and <b>a</b> <b>duck</b> on debut and Hutton was recalled to take his opening position. Laker, the off spinner, replaced his left arm finger spinning colleague Young. Dollery, who had made only 38 in three innings, was replaced by all-rounder Cranston.|$|E
