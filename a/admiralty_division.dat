In the later of his conquest, {{records show that}} the Emperor of Maurya Empire, Chandragupta Maurya, {{as a part of}} war office, {{established}} an <b>Admiralty</b> <b>Division</b> under the Superintendent of Ships. Many historians from ancient India recorded the Indian trade relations with many countries, and even with countries as far as Java and Sumatra. There were also references to the trade routes of countries in the Pacific and Indian Ocean. India also had trade relations with the Greeks and the Romans. At one instance Roman historian Gaius Plinius Secundus mentioned of Indian traders carrying away large masses of gold and silver from Rome, in payment for skins, precious stones, clothes, indigo, sandalwood, herbs, perfumes, and spices.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Admiralty</b> <b>division</b> {{housed a}} few prisoners under naval courts-martial for mutiny, desertion, piracy, {{and what the}} deputy marshal in 1815 {{preferred}} to call [...] "unnatural crimes". Unlike {{other parts of the}} prison that had been built from scratch in 1811, the Admiralty division—as well as the northern boundary wall, the dayroom and the chapel—had been part of the old Borough gaol and were considerably run down. The cells were so rotten they were barely able to confine the prisoners; in 1817 one actually broke through his cell walls. The low boundary wall meant that Admiralty prisoners were often chained to bolts fixed to the floor in the infirmary.|$|E

There were few good barristers specialising in divorce law; two other barristers were sworn into the Probate, Divorce and <b>Admiralty</b> <b>Division</b> along with Denning, and of the three only one had ever practised divorce law.

For the first four years of his judicial career Stevenson was assigned to the Probate, Divorce and <b>Admiralty</b> <b>Division,</b> after which he was transferred to the Queen's Bench Division, where he presided over criminal cases. He then began to attract press attention. Known for his outspokenness, Stevenson described one case as a [...] "pretty anaemic kind of rape", because the victim was the accused's ex-girlfriend and had been hitch-hiking, before sentencing the man to a two-year suspended sentence. To a man acquitted of rape, he remarked [...] "I see you come from Slough. It is a terrible place. You can go back there." [...] In similar vein he told a husband involved in a divorce case that his decision to live in Manchester was [...] "a wholly incomprehensible choice for any free man to make".|$|E

On the seat opposite to her somebody had thoughtfully placed a number of the day's papers.

Her eyes fell instantly upon the name of Mr. Gladstone printed all over the sheet in type of varying size, and she sighed. Life on the ocean wave had been perilous and disagreeable enough, but at any rate she had been free from Mr. Gladstone and his doings. Whatever evil might be said of him, he was not an old man of the sea.
