5|$|An {{example of}} the use of Fleiss' kappa may be the following: Consider {{fourteen}} psychiatrists <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> look at ten patients. Each psychiatrist gives one of possibly five diagnoses to each patient. These are compiled into a matrix, and Fleiss' kappa can be computed from this matrix (see example below) to show the degree of agreement between the psychiatrists above the level of agreement expected by chance.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} round, the contestants <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> predict {{the most popular}} answer to each of three {{question}}s.

5|$|In this test, {{a number}} of cards are {{presented}} to the participants. The figures on the cards differ with respect to color, quantity, and shape. The participants are then given a pile of additional cards and <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> match each one {{to one of the}} previous cards. Typically, children between ages nine and eleven demonstrate the cognitive flexibility needed for this test.|$|E

40|$|Destination {{memory is}} the ability to {{remember}} the receiver of transmitted information. By means of a destination memory directed forgetting task, we investigated whether participants with Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) were able to suppress irrelevant information in destination memory. Twenty-six AD participants and 30 healthy elderly subjects <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> tell 10 different proverbs to 10 different celebrities (List 1). Afterwards, half of the participants were instructed to forget the destinations (i. e., the celebrities) whereas the other half <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> keep them in mind. After telling 10 other proverbs to 10 other celebrities (List 2), participants <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> read numbers aloud. Subsequently, all the participants <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> remember the destinations of List 1 and List 2, regardless of the forget or remember instructions. The results show similar destination memory in AD participants who <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> forget the destinations of List 1 and those who <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> retain them. These findings are attributed to inhibitory deficits, by which AD participants have difficulties to suppress irrelevant information in destination memory...|$|R

5|$|Participants {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the crew may help the GMs {{to set up and}} maintain the environment of the LARP during play by acting as stagehands or playing non-player characters (NPCs) who fill out the setting. Crew typically receive more information about the setting and more direction from the GMs than players do. In a tabletop role-playing game, a GM usually plays all the NPCs, whereas in a LARP, each NPC is typically played by a separate crew member. Sometimes players <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> play NPCs for periods of an event.|$|E

The water is too swift for open canoes, so visitors <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> use kayaks. The swimming area is closed to whitewater boating during the summer months.|$|E
5|$|The name-letter {{effect is}} the {{tendency}} of people to prefer the letters in their name over other letters in the alphabet.
