To maximize precision of estimated tides, only stations with long time series are used; median time series length is 567 days.

As a tool for assessing global ocean tide models, the data set is considerably more reliable than older data sets : the root-mean-square difference with a recent altimetric tide model is approximately 5 mm for the M 2 constituent. Precision is sufficiently high to allow secondary effects in altimetric and bottom-pressure tide differences to be studied. The <b>atmospheric</b> <b>tide</b> in bottom pressure is clearly detected at the S 1, S 2, and T 2 frequencies.

Using a global climate model, we show that even a relatively thin atmosphere can drive terrestrial planets' rotation away from synchronicity.

40|$|Summary. The {{results of}} {{previous}} {{work by the}} authors is used to remove most {{of the effects of}} ocean and atmospheric loading from an 18 -month Earth gravity-tide record. The remaining signal is examined for additional influence of ocean and atmosphere and for evidence of the frequency-dependence of the response of the solid earth. Variations in time of the measured tides are shown to result from the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>tide</b> at Sz and appear to result from variations in ocean tides at other frequencies. The frequency-dependence of the solid earth response near 1 cycle per siderial day is found to be consistent with the nearly diurnal free wobble. However, the influence of the ocean on the small but crucial tide is uncertain. Anomalous responses are observed at several other frequencies but except for the case of p 1 it is argued that anomalous ocean tides are plausible and could therefore explain the observations. ...|$|E
