His precinct responds to a hostage situation at a local liquor store that becomes difficult when it evolves into a media circus, complicated by an aggressive SWAT team leader, Howard Hunter (James B.

His secret lover, public defender Joyce Davenport (Veronica Hamel), appears to be his nemesis as she hounds him about <b>a</b> <b>client</b> <b>who</b> is the lost victim of police bureaucracy.

5|$|Jussi {{found himself}} in the unusual {{position}} of attempting to defend <b>a</b> <b>client</b> <b>who</b> refused to defend himself. With no evidence at his disposal to support Feletti's testimony, he was forced to rely almost entirely on his own oratory. Jussi put forward some aspects of the sequence of events that he said suggested that orders had indeed come from Rome—for example, that Feletti had sent Edgardo straight off to the capital without seeing him—and asserted that the Holy Office and the Pope were far better placed to adjudge the validity of the baptism than a secular court. He quoted at length from Angelo Padovani's account of his meeting with Anna Morisi in July 1858, then cast doubt on the grocer Lepori's claim that he did not even know how to baptise a child—Jussi produced a police report in which Lepori was described as a close friend of a Jesuit priest. Jussi proposed that Lepori and Bussolari might both be lying to protect themselves, and that Morisi's sexual impropriety did not necessarily mean her story was false. He concluded that since Feletti had been inquisitor at the time, he had merely done what that office required him to do, and no crime had been committed.|$|E

25|$|In 1996–97, {{following}} {{the success of}} prevention interventions in neighboring Thailand, the Chinese CDC launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan. These projects showed the feasibility of such programmes, which included condom use to control the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers, and have been officially promoted since 1998. Between 1999 and 2001, the World AIDS Foundation supported a five-site trial of a behavioral intervention in commercial sex workers who worked in entertainment establishments. The intervention included condom promotion, establishment of clinics for sexually transmitted diseases to provide check-ups, and outreach for health education and counseling. HIV-related knowledge improved substantially, {{and the rate of}} bacterial sexually transmitted diseases fell. The rate of condom use at last intercourse increased from around 55% to 68%, and fewer commercial sex workers agreed to sex without a condom when requested by <b>a</b> <b>client</b> <b>who</b> offered more money. The prevalence of gonorrhea fell from about 26% at baseline to 4% after intervention, and the prevalence of chlamydia fell from about 41% to 26%.|$|E

500|$|Lord Brown concurred. [...] He {{said that}} [...] "the gains to {{be derived from}} denying [...] {{immunity}} from suit for breach of that duty substantially exceed whatever loss might be thought likely to result from this", since a potential liability would lead to a [...] "sharpened awareness of the risks of pitching their initial views of the merits of their client’s case too high or too inflexibly lest these views come to expose and embarrass them at a later date." [...] He thought that this was a [...] "healthy development". It would also ensure that <b>a</b> <b>client</b> <b>who</b> was caused loss by an expert witness acting in [...] "an egregious manner" [...] would receive a proper remedy; he said that such cases were likely to be [...] "highly exceptional". Lord Collins, agreeing, noted that the result did not affect the position of the expert vis-a-vis the opposing litigant, where there were [...] "wider considerations of policy" [...] against allowing claims. He also remarked that the existing ability to prosecute expert witnesses for perjury or to take disciplinary proceedings against them for unprofessional conduct in preparing or presenting their evidence did not fit with the claim that a liability to their clients for breach of duty would have a chilling effect on experts' willingness to give evidence. Lord Kerr, who also agreed with the decision, said that if [...] "an expert expresses an honestly held view, even if it differs from that which he may have originally expressed, provided it is an opinion which is tenable, he has nothing to fear from a disgruntled party." ...|$|E

His petition was denied, and Rubin sought certiorari by the Third District Court of Appeal, which also denied the petition. When the case was rescheduled, Rubin again sought to withdraw on the same grounds and again was denied and ordered to proceed to trial. When he again refused, the court issued a contempt order (affirmed on appeal in Rubin v. State) denying review of the district court decision and denying Rubin's petition for a writ of habeas corpus, Rubin was ordered to serve 37 days in jail for contempt of court.|$|E

2500|$|From {{at least}} the late Republic onward, the toga became {{increasingly}} unsuited to manual work or physically active leisure. It was expensive, heavy, hot and sweaty, hard to keep clean, costly to launder and challenging to wear. A toga worn correctly constrained both posture and gait; it was best suited to stately processions, oratory, sitting in the theatre or circus, and displaying oneself before one's peers and inferiors while [...] "ostentatiously doing nothing" [...] at salutationes.

2500|$|In October 2009, The Guardian {{reported}} that it was forbidden to report on a parliamentary matter – a question recorded in a Commons order paper, to be answered by a minister later that week. The paper noted that it was being [...] "forbidden from telling its readers why the paper is prevented—for {{the first time in}} memory—from reporting parliament. Legal obstacles, which cannot be identified, involve proceedings, which cannot be mentioned, on behalf of <b>a</b> <b>client</b> <b>who</b> must remain secret.

[...] The paper further claimed that this case appears [...] "to call into question privileges guaranteeing free speech established under the 1688 Bill of Rights". The only parliamentary question mentioning Carter-Ruck in the relevant period was by Paul Farrelly MP, in reference to legal action by Barclays and Trafigura. The part of the question referencing Carter-Ruck relates to the latter company's September 2009 gagging order on the publication of a 2006 internal report into the 2006 Côte d'Ivoire toxic waste dump scandal, which involved a class action case that the company only settled in September 2009 after The Guardian published some of the commodity trader's internal emails. The reporting injunction was lifted the next day, as Carter-Ruck withdrew it before The Guardian could challenge it in the High Court. Alan Rusbridger credited the rapid back-down of Carter-Ruck to Twitter, as did a BBC article.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first season}} premiere episode shows Jules while she {{examines}} her naked {{body in the}} mirror for signs of aging. Jules, now divorced from her husband Bobby, tries to re-enter the dating world and relate to her young assistant Laurie. Jules' best friend and neighbor Ellie tries to prevent her from going out while her son is constantly being embarrassed by both of his parents. The show was originally about older women ("cougars") dating younger men, as Jules begins dating Josh (Nick Zano) and Barb is often seen [...] "hunting". Jules' relationship with Josh ends when he tells her that he loves her and Jules does not feel the same way. Later Jules begins a relationship with Jeff (Scott Foley) <b>a</b> <b>client</b> <b>who</b> infuriates Jules with his indecision.

After her relationship with Jeff ends, Jules falls into bed with her ex-husband Bobby (Brian Van Holt). This causes Bobby's feelings for Jules to stir even more and he later tells her that he wants her back. Jules, however, tells him that she loves him but [...] "not that way any more" [...] and that their happy ending is them as friends, raising their son Travis (Dan Byrd) together.
