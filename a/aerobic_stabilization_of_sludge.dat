40|$|The {{process of}} <b>aerobic</b> <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> {{is a process}} used in small or medium sewage {{treatment}} plants (up to 15 000 ENI). Owing to its energy intensity resulting from the need for intensive sedimentation and longterm process, many researches are being conducted on its intensification. One such method is disintegration. The purpose of disintegration {{is to increase the}} susceptibility of sewage sludge to aerobic decomposition by breaking up sediment flocs into fine particles along with the breakdown of cell membranes and then allowing biodegradation. The paper presents results of research of aerobic stabilized sludge, which is a mixture of non-disintegrated and microwave disintegrated sludge in different volume proportions. It was shown that sludge stabilized more quickly during the first days of the process. The minimum reduction of organic solids required at 38 % for stabilized sludge occure earlier in mixed sludge tests than in non-disintegrated sludge...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: The aerobic {{treatment}} {{of solid waste}} {{has been shown to}} be a viable means of rapidly stabilizing landfills through aerobically-enhanced waste degradation. <b>Aerobic</b> <b>stabilization</b> has an additional benefit of reducing landfill emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, which normally occur during anaerobic decomposition of landfilled waste. However the value of reduced methane emissions from <b>aerobic</b> <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> landfills has not been realized due to the difficulty of verifying methane destruction during {{aerobic treatment}}. The authors propose a framework for monitoring methane destruction in an <b>aerobic</b> <b>stabilization</b> system for use in verifying greenhouse gas emission reductions based on comparing the initial composition of the landfill gas with the composition of the exhaust gas from an <b>aerobic</b> <b>stabilization</b> system. 1...|$|R

Complete removal <b>of</b> the <b>sludge</b> and tank shells can become costly while providing little benefit to health, safety, and the environment. An alternative to the removal of the residual wastes and tank shells is the use of in situ solidification and stabilization techniques to immobilize the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and radioactive components present in waste storage tanks. One technology for in situ remediation of tank wastes is Ground Environmental Service's (GES's) Multi-Point-Injection (MPI.) technology. MPI technology is a patented delivery system, which uses simple and inexpensive injection tools for rapid delivery of grout or other treatment agents, {{as well as for the}} emplacement of subsurface barriers. Through the use of tailored grout formulations in conjunction with a system of specially designed grout injection tools, MPI technology is capable of producing a uniform mixture <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> and grout.

40|$|Dentel, StevenOne of {{the major}} {{challenges}} of biowaste management is efficient removal <b>of</b> water from <b>sludges</b> or biosolids, which are generally quite hydrophilic. Also, any water that is removed must be re-treated to remove contaminants that do not partition completely into the solids fraction. To address these issues, the membrane distillation process was adapted for drying and <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludges.</b> The hydrophobic membranes used in this process are non-wetting, with pore spaces that only allow vapor transport. Water vapor can be expelled due to a moderate temperature gradient. Other constituents, including both particulate and dissolved, are retained. The permeate purity, therefore, {{is expected to be}} high. This thesis presents data showing usable rates of moisture transfer with modest temperature gradients. In the modeling effort to simulate the moisture transfer from the system, effectiveness and validity of three candidate models were examined: a diffusion equation with flux type boundary conditions; a two-period model, and a stagnant film model. Among these, the stagnant film model is considered as a fundamental modeling framework, because it incorporates all of the factors controlling drying intensity and pattern, and it successfully predicts the mass transfer across the membrane. The resistance associated with the stagnant film was quantified as 0. 01 m {{in the presence of the}} membrane. The prediction is used to estimate the waste loading that a membrane enclosed pit latrine can handle daily. The provided simulation of the heat transfer accompanied with the mass transfer during the process also allows for calculation and optimization of the energy requirements for the system to operate at the desired rate.

Due to the high organic content <b>of</b> <b>sludge,</b> bentonite had been added in order to stabilize the system. For this purpose, 4 x 4 x 16 cm mortar prism samples were prepared. Their composition was: 50 % w/w sewage sludge (primary sewage sludge from Psyttalia Athens and secondary biological sewage sludge from Metamorphosis Athens), 30 % w/w cement CEMI 42. 5 and finally 20 % w/w bentonite. The samples were cured for 28 days at 25 degrees C and compressive strength was tested. Highest strength and lowest leachability were the criteria for selection of the optimum product by the S/S technique. An extensive study using several characterization techniques focusing on hydration reactions was carried out. The instrumental analysis included: X-ray diffraction analysis, thermal analysis (TGA, DTA), electron scanning microscopy (SEM), infrared analysis (FT-IR) as well as tests for the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP). The S/S products had been proven throughout the study as a viable solution for stabilizing heavy metals. They {{can be used in}} many applications such as in landfill liners, slurry walls and building blocks. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|<b>Stabilization</b> <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> (SS) {{prior to}} its land {{disposal}} may help control the mobility of SS-borne contaminants, particularly potentially toxic metals. We {{examined the effects of}} stabilized SS application on soil properties, biomass production, and phytoavailability of Cu and Zn to plants grown in two contrasting soils, Entisol and Aridisol. Stabilized SS mixtures were created by mixing SS in a 3 -to- 1 ratio with bentonite (B), sugar beet factory lime (SL), brick factory fly ash (BFA), rice straw (RS), water hyacinth (WH), and 50 : 50 mixture of RS and SL. Mixtures were applied at 50 Mg ha(- 1), and Sorghum vulgare L. and Eurica sativa were grown in a pot experiment. All the amendments increased plant availability and uptake of both Cu and Zn compared to the unamended control. The application of stabilized SS increased dry plant biomass significantly and decreased DTPA-extractable elements compared to the non-stabilized SS treatment. We conclude that of the six amendments studied, especially sugar beet factory lime (SL) and bentonite (B), are promising for the <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> metalcontaminated biosolids and should be tested under field conditions...|$|R

In addition, the skilled personnel are not easily available to assure sound maintenance and operation <b>of</b> the conventional <b>sludge</b> treatment systems such as aerobic and anaerobic digestion; therefore, it is necessary to employ low cost and low technology practices in sludge management. Using earthworms in <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge,</b> which has been approved by considerable work, can be a good alterative. This research was conducted to study the effect of stocking densities on sludge stabilization and sludge characteristics. In this regard, 40, 80 and 120 g earthworm wet weight were introduced into each of the plastic bins sizing 36 x 25 x 20 cm (length x width x height) to provide the desired stocking densities of 0. 45, 0. 90 and 1. 35 kg worms m - 2. Each bin received 2 kg waste activated sludge.

40|$|Stabilization process {{within a}} sewage sludge {{landfill}} determined through both {{particle size distribution}} and content of humic substances {{as well as by}} FT-IR analysis Ying Zhu 1, 2 and Youcai Zhao 2 Landfill is largely considered as a reliable option for sewage sludge disposal in most metropolitan areas worldwide due to the huge quantities of this waste to be disposed of and the relatively low costs of such a kind <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> management. It has been found that the sludge in the landfill degrades rapidly and becomes stabilized within a few years. In the present study, the sludge from different landfill stages was characterized by particle size distribution, humic substances contents and elemental composition, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), as the landfill time increased. In general, the mean particle size <b>of</b> the <b>sludge</b> increased from 37 mm at day 0 to 143 mm at 300 days and the corresponding median particle size increased from 13 to 70 mm. The stability of particle size distribution can be assessed by the mean or median particle size. The humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) contents extracted from dry sludge after different landfill periods increased from 4. 2 and 2. 7 % of day 0 to 5. 6 and 3. 1 %, respectively, at 400 days, thereby indicating that the <b>stabilization</b> process <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> in a landfill is also a humification process. The HA samples contained more carbon and nitrogen, and less hydrogen and oxygen than the FA samples, indicating a high degree of maturity and humification of these HA samples. The FT-IR spectra indicated that easily degradable organic matter components, such as aliphatic chains and protein, were distinctly decomposed during landfill. Based on the changes in the band relative intensity, it was concluded that after 300 days in a landfill the sludge is {{still in the process of}} degradation and maturity...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} article is to show the {{possibilities}} of chemometric tools and the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) model, {{as well as to}} understand the complexities of the fluorescence emission-excitation matrix (EEM) of water-soluble organic matter (WSOM) extracted from sewage sludge samples obtained with different origins and stabilization procedures. The variation in the composition of WSOM in the different sewage sludge samples could be correlated with the conditions of stabilization; therefore, the use of fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor these changes can be a useful tool to optimize the management of this residual flux, avoiding environmental pollution. However, the “contour density” EEM maps obtained with fluorescence present continuous spectra with different peaks, valleys, and shoulders where manual peak picking can be complicated and subjective, especially in complex matrixes such as sewage sludge. With the PARAFAC algorithm, it is possible to resolve the emission and excitation spectra of the different fluorescence components present in the samples and their contribution to the total fluorescence. Also, the contribution (scores) of the different fluorophors can be coupled with another chemometric tool to provide an effective classification method using the <b>stabilization</b> conditions <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> as main criterion. In this study, a wide survey <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> samples (287) was characterized by fluorescence emission-excitation matrix. The final molecular composition <b>of</b> the sewage <b>sludge</b> samples was not related to the <b>stabilization</b> (<b>aerobic</b> vs anaerobic) treatments.

40|$|In {{an earlier}} {{demonstration}} of an innovative mercury stabilization {{technology for the}} Department of Energy, ATG's full-scale process stabilized mercury in soils that initially contained more than 260 ppm of mercury of unknown speciation. The treated waste satisfied the leaching standards for mercury that qualify wastes containing less than 260 ppm for land disposal. This paper describes the extension of that work to demonstrate a full-scale process for the <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> a representative <b>sludge</b> that contained more than 260 ppm of Hg of several mercury species. RCRA (Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) regulations now require the recovery of mercury from any waste containing more than 260 ppm of mercury, usually with thermal retorts. The results of this work with a surrogate <b>sludge,</b> and <b>of</b> the previous work with an actual soil, support a proposal now before the U. S.

40|$|From an {{economic}} {{point of view}} in the process <b>of</b> <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> {{it is important to know}} the kinetics of decomposition of organic matter and sediment retention time in the stability chamber. This involves among other things, the investment costs of building installations, expenses related to the operation of technologies or the acreage of the occupied space. One method <b>of</b> <b>stabilization</b> is autothermal thermophilic aerobic digestion (ATAD). The speed of the process of ATAD can be illustrated by examining the individual parameters such as: dry organic matter or chemical demand for oxygen. Having knowledge of the kinetics of the process would allow for its optimization. However, in the available literature, there is no detailed information on this subject. Therefore, in order to deepen the knowledge in this regard, a study of the issue process was conducted. At the same time, a number of simplifications have been made. It was assumed that the ATAD process proceeds in accordance with the law of mass action, which allows for mathematical recognition of completeness of reaction and reaction rate. As part of its analysis the results obtained on the real object have been referred to the rate equations of various orders. The study was conducted on the sewage sludge derived from a sewage treatment plant in Olecko, where two-step process autothermal aerobic <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> digestion had been introduced.

Work to identify the kinetics of the process are aimed at, among others, creating a model describing the speed of the process, including obtaining an answer whether the above equations can be the basis for further work on identifying the factors influencing the stabilization process...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increasing}} interest in wastewater treatment in last decades to reduce human footprint. Primarily, anaerobic technology focused on treatment and <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge,</b> but now the tendency is {{to give it a}} major role in low cost treatment of high/low strength wastewaters, since anaerobic digestion offers energy generation through gas production. Anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBR) combine anaerobic digestion with membrane filtration. They are becoming a feasible option for treating previous unsuitable low-strength wastewaters, decoupling hydraulic and solid retention times, and providing successful treatment with the benefits of biogas production. However, the digestion process is optimal at mesophilic or termophilic (35 - 37 ºC), requiring heating of reactors. The more inexpensive option to treat the wastewater at its ambient temperature is feasible using AnMBR since this type of reactor can offer long sludge retention times. On the other hand, the digestion equilibrium turns out more sensible and delicate, and performing a proper and robust start-up of AnMBR in ambient temperatures is still challenging. The aim of the thesis was the successful startup and <b>stabilization</b> <b>of</b> AnMBR systems at ambient temperature (25 ºC) and low organic loading rate (OLR). Reactor operation was monitored, and the most relevant process parameters were considered for the aim. Two pilot-scale AnMBR’s (120 L) were used with an external membrane configuration. The experiment was carried out in 100 days. Substrate feeding consisted of synthetic dairy wastewater with added nutrients solution. The inoculum was provided from a full-scale anaerobic plant at a digester of BV dairy (UK) treating dairy wastewater at 30 ºC. Main operation parameters were monitored every day, along with gas production and methane yield. Laboratory tests were performed twice a week with samples of the reactors and effluent. A number of parameters were analyzed, the most important of which were total solids content (TSS), alkalinity, fatty acids, biogas content and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The startup of the two AnMBR’s differed greatly. In System 1, stable conditions were acquired in one month of operation. System 2 failed after 20 days of function, and did not achieve successful startup. It was not possible to fully recover it during the days of study due to dramatically slow growth of microorganisms and low stability of the process. Thus, satisfactory system performance could be achieved but the ambient anaerobic process was vulnerable to inhibitory conditions. Both systems showed that the delicate process operation required fast corrective measures to prevent digestion failure. Causes of instability and failure were: washout of biomass, high content of VFA, low buffering capacity and poor performance of technical equipment and low pH. However, the digestion could stand a lower pH range than found in literature. In conclusion, the best parameters to control the startup were pH, alkalinity, methane content, biomass content and organic removal. In this sense, low buffering capacity of a reactor makes it vulnerable to inhibition by sudden pH changes, easily solved by systematic addition of a buffering compound. Finally, the use of simple and fast alkalimetric methodologies can give satisfactory process overview compared to complex and more precise techniques for alkalinity measurement...|$|R
