That interface is compared to the <b>pivot</b> <b>table</b> in a laboratory-based experiment. The {{results show that the}} alternative interface is a better interface to use for ad hoc access to OLAP data. The results for the subjects using the <b>pivot</b> <b>table</b> are very poor, with nearly a third of them being unable to successfully complete any of three simple analysis tasks. These results have important implications, as many systems and software tools are now based on the <b>pivot</b> <b>table</b> interface. The <b>pivot</b> <b>table</b> could be too difficult for most users to use, limiting the success of business intelligence systems based on OLAP technology...|$|R

Our goal is cre-ating <b>pivot</b> <b>tables</b> for accessing collections of images, their content, tags, and metadata. This is a challenging task as automatic descrip-tors for image content are noisy, tags are numerous and subjective, and metadata can have many types.

40|$|Abstract—The query for triple {{information}} on product– attribute (property) –value {{is one of}} the most frequent queries in e-commerce. In storing the triple (product–attribute– value) information, a vertical schema is effective for avoiding sparse data and schema evolution, while a conventional horizontal schema often shows better query performance, since the properties are queried as groups clustered by each product. Therefore, we propose two storage schemas: a vertical schema as a primary table structure for the triple information in RDBMS and a <b>pivoted</b> <b>table</b> index created from the basic vertical table as an additional index structure for accelerating query processing. The <b>pivoted</b> <b>table</b> index is beneficial to improving the performance of the frequent pattern query on the group properties associated with each product class.

25|$|Numbers '09 {{includes}} {{a system for}} categorizing data similar to <b>pivot</b> <b>tables.</b> <b>Pivots</b> were introduced in Improv and were manipulated by dragging the category headers, allowing the user to quickly rotate rows into columns or vice versa. Although Numbers has similar draggable objects representing formulas, they are not used for this feature and the direct manipulation is missing. Instead, Numbers places pop-up menus in the column headers allowing the user to collapse multiple rows into totals (sums, averages, etc.) based on data that is common across rows. This is similar functionality to a <b>pivot</b> <b>table,</b> but lacks the ease of re-arrangement of the Improv model and other advanced features.|$|R

In this work the new modification of the <b>pivot</b> <b>tables</b> method was proposed that is besides distance computations optimized also for a number of I/O operations. Proposed Clustered <b>pivot</b> <b>tables</b> method is indexing clusters of similar objects that were created by another metric access method - the M-tree. The indexing of clustered objects has a positive effect for searching within indexed database. Whereas the clusters are paged in second memory, page containing such cluster, which do not satisfy particular query, is not accessed in second memory at all. Non-relevant objects, that are out of the query range, are not loaded into memory, what has the effect of decreasing number of I/O operations and total volume of transferred data. The correctness of proposed approach was experimentally proved and experimental results of proposed method was compared to selected metric access methods...|$|R
