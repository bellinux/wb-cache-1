5|$|Upon commissioning, Taylor joined Destroyer Division 12 of the Atlantic Fleet. She cruised {{with that}} fleet during World War I but saw no action. Following {{the war on}} 1 April 1919, she was {{assigned}} to Destroyer Division 8. In 1920, Taylor was placed in reduced commission though still operating on the Atlantic coast. That summer, on 17 July, the Navy adopted the <b>alpha-numeric</b> hull designation system, and Taylor became DD-94. In October, she was placed back in full commission and, until the summer of 1922, operated with Destroyer Division 8, Flotilla 8, Squadron 3. On 21 June 1922, the ship was placed out of commission at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Following overhaul, Texas resumed duty {{with the}} Atlantic Fleet early in 1919. On 10 March, {{she became the}} first American {{battleship}} to launch an airplane when Lieutenant Commander Edward O. McDonnell flew a British-built Sopwith Camel off the warship. Later in 1919 Texass captain, Nathan C. Twining, successfully employed naval aircraft to spot the fall of shells during a main battery exercise. The results were that aircraft-borne gunfire spotters were significantly more accurate than shipboard spotters. In testimony to the Navy General Board, Lieutenant Commander Kenneth Whiting attested that the increase in gunfire effectiveness with air spotting was likely to be as great as 200%. As a result of these first experiments, the Navy would add floatplanes to all of the fleet's battleships and newer cruisers. In May 1919, Texas served as a plane guard and navigational aid for the successful attempt by Navy Curtiss NC flying boat NC-4 to become the first airplane to cross the Atlantic. On 26 July 1919 Texas entered the Pacific Ocean as part of the newly formed Pacific Fleet and she would spend the next five and half years as a part of Pacific Fleet. On 17 July the following year, she was designated BB-35 under the Navy's newly adopted <b>alpha-numeric</b> system of hull classification symbols.|$|E
25|$|The Spa Valley Railway {{recently}} completed its extension to the National Rail network at Eridge, with through ticketing. Stations {{were given the}} <b>alpha-numeric</b> NLCs K659, Tunbridge Wells (SpVR); K570, Groombridge (SpVR); and K571, High Rocks Halt (SpVR).|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} lists all rail {{stations of}} Light Rail Transit (LRT) systems in Singapore. As the LRT systems are intra-town loop and/or shuttle services, train routes may not run in ascending/descending {{sequence of the}} stations' <b>alpha-numeric</b> codes.|$|E
25|$|VicRoads, {{the agency}} {{responsible}} for highways {{in the state of}} Victoria, has often declared rural limited-access dual carriageways as freeways. Furthermore, VicRoads applies the M designation to these roads in <b>alpha-numeric</b> route numbers, where other states will only do so if access is completely controlled.|$|E
25|$|CAPs {{were also}} redesignated {{beginning}} {{about the same}} time. They went from <b>alpha-numeric</b> designations, (such as Oscar-2), to numeric designations, such as 2-7-4. The first digit designated the group (1–4), the second designated the unit (replacing the letters), and the third designated the platoon.|$|E
25|$|In December, 2012, William Cheswick {{wrote an}} article {{published}} in ACM magazine that included the mathematical possibilities of how easy or difficult it would be to break passwords that are constructed using the commonly recommended, and sometimes followed, standards of today. In his article, William showed that a standard eight character <b>alpha-numeric</b> password could withstand a brute force attack of ten million attempts per second, and remain unbroken for 252 days. Ten million attempts each second is the acceptable rate of attempts using a multi-core system that most users would have access to. A much greater degree of attempts, at the rate of 7 billion per second, could also be achieved when using modern GPUs. At this rate, the same 8 character <b>alpha-numeric</b> password could be broken in approximately 30 seconds. Increasing the password complexity to a 13 character <b>alpha-numeric</b> password increases the time needed to crack it to more than 900,000 years at 7 billion attempts per second. This is, of course, assuming the password does not use a common word that a dictionary attack could break much sooner. Using a password of this strength reduces the obligation to change it as often as many organizations require, including the U.S. Government, as it could not be reasonably broken in such a short period of time.|$|E

25|$|Commander's Edition was, effectively, a {{ground-up}} rewrite of the rules. The old rule-number {{system was}} discarded {{in favor of}} a completely new <b>alpha-numeric</b> system. The three Expansions were scrapped and re-packaged. However, other than the new (bigger) reorganized rulebook, the initial 1983 release of the boxed set was mostly unchanged from the Designer's Edition, including the box (later printings labeled it Star Fleet Battles: Volume I).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the registration many gliders still show a large trigraph or competition number on the fin and {{on the underside of}} a wing. The 'comp' numbers are also issued by the BGA. These consisted of three-digit numbers at first but later could be any three <b>alpha-numeric</b> characters. The comp number or the trigraph is usually the most visible marking on a British glider.|$|E
25|$|In September 2012, Dubai Airports {{changed the}} names of concourses {{to make it easier}} for {{passengers}} to navigate the airport. Concourse 1, in which over 100 international airlines operate, became Concourse C. Concourse 2 became Concourse B and Concourse 3 became Concourse A. The gates in Terminal 2 were changed and are now numbered F1 to F6. The remaining <b>alpha-numeric</b> sequences are being reserved for future airport facilities that are part of the Dubai Airports' $7.8 billion expansion programme, including Concourse D.|$|E
500|$|Encoding is a {{technique}} permitting an AAC user to produce an entire word, sentence or phrase using {{only one or two}} activations of their AAC system. [...] In numeric, <b>alpha-numeric,</b> and letter encoding (also known as abbreviation-expansion), words and sentences are coded as sequences of letters and numbers. For example, typing [...] "HH" [...] may retrieve [...] "Hello, how are you?". In iconic encoding strategies, such as Semantic compaction, icons (picture symbols) are combined in a sequence to produce words or phrases.|$|E

500|$|Operation Bernhard was an {{exercise}} by Nazi Germany to forge British bank notes. The initial {{plan was to}} drop the notes over Britain {{to bring about a}} collapse of the British economy during the Second World War. The first phase was run from early 1940 by the [...] (SD) under the title [...] (Operation Andreas, Operation Andrew). The unit successfully duplicated the rag paper used by the British, produced near-identical engraving blocks and deduced the algorithm used to create the <b>alpha-numeric</b> serial code on each note. The unit closed in early 1942 after its head, Alfred Naujocks, fell out of favour with his superior officer, Reinhard Heydrich.|$|E
500|$|All cadets reside {{on campus}} for their entire {{four years in}} one of the seven barracks buildings. Most cadets are housed with one roommate, but some rooms are {{designed}} for three cadets. Cadets are grouped into companies identified by <b>alpha-numeric</b> codes. All companies live together in the same barracks area. The academy has the cadets change companies after their freshman or sophomore years. This process is known as scrambling, and the method of scrambling has changed several times in recent years. All 4,000cadets dine together at breakfast and lunch in the Washington Hall during the weekdays. The cadet fitness center, Arvin Cadet Physical Development Center (usually just called [...] "Arvin" [...] by cadets and faculty), which was rebuilt in 2004, houses extensive physical fitness facilities and equipment for student use.|$|E

2500|$|Registration {{provides}} the legal authority to {{practice as a}} marriage celebrant and a four-digit or five-digit <b>alpha-numeric</b> registration number. Once registered (or authorised as it is also known), the marriage celebrant can marry couples in virtually any location (e.g. reception centre [...] "chapels", other de-consecrated chapels and churches, historic buildings, galleries, private homes, parks and gardens, beaches, headlands, boats etc.) and {{at any time of}} the day or night. The celebrant is responsible for processing and lodging all legal paperwork to register the marriage in accordance with defined procedures. This gives the Australian Civil Marriage Celebrant more status than they enjoy in other western countries, but also additional legal responsibility.|$|E
2500|$|Emphasizing the image's {{ubiquitous}} {{nature and}} wide appeal, the Maryland Institute College of Art called the picture {{a symbol of}} the 20th century and the world's most famous photograph. Versions of it have been painted, printed, digitized, embroidered, tattooed, silk-screened, sculpted or sketched on nearly every surface imaginable, leading the Victoria and Albert Museum to say that the photograph has been reproduced more than any other image in photography. Jonathan Green, director of the UCR/California Museum of Photography, has speculated that [...] "Korda's image has worked its way into languages around the world. It has become an <b>alpha-numeric</b> symbol, a hieroglyph, an instant symbol. It mysteriously reappears whenever there's a conflict. There isn’t anything else in history that serves in this way".|$|E
2500|$|During its {{formative}} years between 1981 and 1985 the regiment {{consisted of two}} reconnaissance squadrons, with the 1st Reconnaissance Squadron responsible for the Northern Territory and the 2nd Reconnaissance Squadron responsible for the Kimberley region in Western Australia. In early 1986 the <b>alpha-numeric</b> designations gave way to geographic names, with 1 Squadron being redesignated Darwin Squadron and 2 Squadron becoming Kimberley Squadron. Further growth of the unit saw Centre Squadron and Arnhem Squadron also being raised in 1986. Each of the regional reconnaissance squadrons has its own AO, and is further divided {{into a number of}} [...] "troops", each of which consists of a number of [...] "patrols". Darwin Squadron is based a Larrakeyah Barracks in Darwin and has maintained a presence in Daly River, Jabiru, Katherine, Maningrida and Wadeye, and on Bathurst, Crocker, Goulburn and Melville islands. The Kimberly Squadron is headquartered in Broome, with elements based in Argyle, Derby, Kalumburu, Kununarra, Bidyadanga and Wyndham. Arnhem Squadron is responsible for the eastern Northern Territory with its headquarters in Nhulunbuy, and elements at Lake Evella, Milingimbi, Ngukurr, Numbulwar and Ramingining, and on Elcho Island and Groote Eylandt. Centre Squadron operates from the South Australian border northwards, including the main regional centres of Alice Springs and Tennant Creek, the sparse Barkly Tableland, and north to the Robinson River and Borroloola.|$|E
