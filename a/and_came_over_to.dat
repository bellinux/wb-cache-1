2500|$|Much of the {{background}} cast came from Mendelson's home neighborhood in northern California. According to Robbins, the children viewed the script's sophisticated dialogue as [...] "edgy," [...] finding several words and phrases, among them [...] "eastern syndicate", difficult to pronounce. He recalled the recording sessions as chaotic, with excited children running rampant. Nevertheless, the recording of A Charlie Brown Christmas was completed in one day. Jefferson Airplane was recording next door <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> get the children's autographs. Following the special's broadcast, the children became wildly popular in their respective elementary schools; Robbins recalled groups approaching him asking him to recite lines of dialogue.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} arrival of her house guests, Joan had learned that her husband was still {{maintaining}} his small apartment and still involved with Ann Kurth. On the day following the argument, Hill took his son for a haircut, and during the drive, they went to his apartment to pick up some things; the boy talked with his mother about it when he arrived home. Joan invited her friend and neighbor Vann Maxwell over to discuss the matter, and when she arrived, announced an impromptu game of bridge with Settegast and Woolen in the music room. John Hill was listening to music {{at one end of the}} room while the women played cards at the other. Joan began loudly discussing her husband, then slipping into silence whenever he approached. She told the women that she was planning to consult a lawyer on Monday, and Maxwell became uneasy with the situation. She asked Joan to be quiet or she would leave. Joan then started writing notes to her friend, in which she repeated her intention to speak to a lawyer, and to take John out of her will. After a tense evening, Hill put on a romantic record <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> stand behind his wife's chair. Settegast suggested the couple should dance, and they did. Afterwards they retired to bed. The next morning, Joan told Settegast that Hill had made her [...] "very happy" [...] the previous night. [...] "He told me things I've never heard from the man before in our whole married life. I think it's going to be all right between us from now on." ...|$|E
