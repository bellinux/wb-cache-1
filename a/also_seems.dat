5|$|The Eurymedon was {{a highly}} {{significant}} victory for the Delian League, which probably ended {{once and for all}} the threat of another Persian invasion of Greece. It <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> to have prevented any Persian attempt to reconquer the Asiatic Greeks until at least 451 BC. The accession of further cities of Asia Minor to the Delian league, particularly from Caria, probably followed Cimon's campaign there.|$|E
5|$|After {{finding out}} that Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) was flashed in the parking lot, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) opens an investigation. He orders Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to {{interview}} Phyllis and make a sketch of the flasher. However, Phyllis says she didn't {{get a good look}} at him, so Pam instead draws a picture of Dwight with a mustache and without glasses. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) assists (who <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> to notice that the sketch looks similar to Dwight) an oblivious Dwight in posting fliers with Pam's sketch on it around town.|$|E
5|$|Amenhotep's reign saw {{literary}} developments. The Book of What {{is in the}} Underworld ('the Egyptian Book of the Dead'), {{an important}} funerary text used in the New Kingdom, {{is believed to have}} reached its final form during Amenhotep's reign, since it first appears in the decoration of the tomb of his successor Thutmose I. The Ebers papyrus, which is the main source for information on ancient Egyptian medicine, <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> to date to this time (the mention of the Heliacal rise of Sothis by which the early New Kingdom chronology is usually calculated was found on the back of this document).|$|E
50|$|They <b>also</b> <b>seem</b> to be playful, {{and make}} Akira clean {{up most of}} their mess. They <b>also</b> <b>seem</b> to be {{extremely}} unskilled, or at least extremely unwilling to do housework, which makes Akira {{the only one to}} do all the cooking and cleaning.|$|R

50|$|Fans' attitudes <b>also</b> <b>seem</b> to have changed. With a lower {{barrier to}} entry, even the least {{dedicated}} can view anime {{with a few}} clicks. Newer fans <b>also</b> <b>seem</b> less willing to purchase or collect DVDs. Consequently, the anime industry's view of fansubbing has changed. US companies have begun blaming fansubbers for the decline in DVD sales.|$|R
5|$|As Sayid and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) {{discuss the}} attack on Sayid, Locke {{suggests}} that Sawyer is the culprit, since he is doing well for himself on the island, hoarding other people's possessions, and <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> to dislike Sayid. Meanwhile, Shannon begins to have trouble breathing due to her lack of medication and panic resulting from this problem. Jack tries beating answers out of Sawyer by punching him, but stops when he sees others' disapproval. Then with Jack's approval, Sayid ties Sawyer to a tree and tortures him for answers, revealing that he has tortured people before.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of Corythosaurus and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{suggest that it}} may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals. The sense of hearing in hadrosaurids, specifically such as Lophorhothon, <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> to have been greatly developed because of an elongated lagena. The presence of a thin stapes (an ear bone that is rod-like in reptiles), combined with a large eardrum implies the existence of a sensitive middle ear. It is possible that hadrosaurid ears are sensitive enough to detect as much sound as a modern crocodilian.|$|E
5|$|One of Bach's {{predecessors}} {{as director}} musices of the Neukirche in Leipzig was Melchior Hoffmann. Around 1707 he composed a German Magnificat based on Luther's German {{translation of the}} Magnificat. The portfolio of performance parts of this composition was updated until well into Bach's time in Leipzig. The work, known as Kleine Magnificat (Little Magnificat), was for some time attributed to Bach, but later listed as spurious in the BWV catalogue (BWVAnh.21 / Anh. III 168‑>). BWV189, a Visitation cantata on a libretto that paraphrases {{the text of the}} Magnificat canticle, <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> rather to have been composed by Hoffmann than by Bach, to whom this work used to be attributed.|$|E

5|$|Sinatra {{with a cold}} is Picasso without paint, Ferrari without fuel--only worse. For {{the common}} cold robs Sinatra of that uninsurable jewel, his voice, cutting into {{the core of his}} confidence, and it affects not only his own psyche but <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> to cause a kind of {{psychosomatic}} nasal drip within dozens of people who work for him, drink with him, love him, depend on him for their own welfare and stability. A Sinatra with a cold can, in a small way, send vibrations through the entertainment industry and beyond as surely as a President of the United States, suddenly sick, can shake the national economy.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{material}} in the pamphlet appears to be either a straight reprint or plagiarism of older material, including from a 1734 text, Pretty Doings in a Protestant Nation, by the pseudonymous Father Poussin. Part of the same section <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> to have appeared in William Walsh's 1691 A Dialogue Concerning Women. Another reused source is a c.1731 (1720 in some sources) pamphlet, Plain Reasons for the Growth of Sodomy in England.|$|E
5|$|The annual age-adjusted {{incidence}} rate (AAIR) of PSP {{is thought to}} be three to six times as high in males as in females. Fishman cites AAIR's of 7.4 and 1.2 cases per 100,000 person-years in males and females, respectively. Significantly above-average height is also associated with increased risk of PSP – in people who are at least 76 inches (1.93 meters) tall, the AAIR is about 200 cases per 100,000 person-years. Slim build <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> to increase the risk of PSP.|$|E

5|$|The luteal {{phase of}} the menstrual cycle {{is about the same}} length in most {{individuals}} (mean 14.13 days, SD 1.41 days) whereas the follicular phase tends to show much more variability (log-normally distributed with 95% of individuals having follicular phases between 10.3 and 16.3 days). The follicular phase <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> to get significantly shorter with age (geometric mean 14.2 days in women aged 18–24 vs. 10.4 days in women aged 40–44).|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} {{major source of}} {{information}} on the games is Cassius Dio who lived in the latter second and early third centuries. His History of Rome spans 80 books written in 22 years, but much of which are only fragments. He is noted for his attention to detail in administrative affairs, but for major events his writing can be merely impressionistic, with a greater emphasis put on his interpretation of the events' significance within the wider historical context rather than reporting details. His sources are varied: he relies on many of the major commentators but <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> to have paid close attention to public records. His account of the Titus games is not sourced.|$|E
5|$|The valley <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> to have {{suffered}} an official plundering during the virtual civil war, which started {{during the reign}} of Ramesses XI. The tombs were opened, all the valuables were removed, and the mummies were collected into two large caches. One in the tomb of Amenhotep II, contained sixteen, and others were hidden within Amenhotep I's tomb. A few years later most of them were moved to the Deir el-Bahri cache, containing no fewer than forty royal mummies and their coffins. Only tombs whose locations were lost (KV62, KV63 and KV46, although both KV62 and KV46 were robbed soon after their actual closure) were undisturbed during this period.|$|E

5|$|Use of this {{mushroom}} as a {{food source}} <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> to have existed in North America. A classic description of this use of A.muscaria by an African-American mushroom seller in Washington, D.C., in the late 19th century is described by American botanist Frederick Vernon Coville. In this case, the mushroom, after parboiling, and soaking in vinegar, is made into a mushroom sauce for steak. It is also consumed {{as a food}} in parts of Japan. The most well-known current use as an edible mushroom is in Nagano Prefecture, Japan. There, it is primarily salted and pickled.|$|E
5|$|Yet it <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> to {{many that}} science will {{eventually}} have to explain such experiences. This follows from an assumption {{about the possibility of}} reductive explanations. According to this view, if an attempt can be successfully made to explain a phenomenon reductively (e.g., water), then it can be explained why the phenomenon has all of its properties (e.g., fluidity, transparency). In the case of mental states, this means {{that there needs to be}} an explanation of why they have the property of being experienced in a certain way.|$|E
5|$|In Sandoz's apartment, Mulder and Scully find {{a picture}} of him with Albert Hosteen; they also find Merkmallen's dismembered body in a trash bag. The agents report to Skinner, with Mulder believing that Sandoz is being framed and that the {{artifact}} emits galactic radiation. He <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> to know that someone else is involved on the case, but Skinner remains silent. However, after the agents leave, Skinner hands a video tape of their conversation to Alex Krycek, who later provides it to Barnes. Scully travels to New Mexico and discovers that Hosteen is dying of cancer; Scully runs into Sandoz and corners him. Sandoz claims that Albert was helping him translate the artifacts, which had included passages from the Bible. Meanwhile, Mulder goes to the university to tail Barnes, but is overcome by his headache and passes out in the stairwell.|$|E

5|$|The Congregation elected Vermigli abbot of {{the monastery}} at San Pietro ad Aram, Naples in 1537. There he became acquainted with Juan de Valdés, {{a leader of the}} spirituali movement. Valdés {{introduced}} Vermigli to the writings of Protestant reformers. Toward the end of his time in Naples, he read Martin Bucer's commentaries on the Gospels and the Psalms, and Zwingli's De vera et falsa religione. Reading these works was an act of ecclesiastical defiance, but not an uncommon one in reformist circles. Vermigli seems to have slowly moved in a Protestant direction primarily through study of the Bible and the Church Fathers, especially Augustine. He probably read Protestant literature critically; it was common for those in reform-minded circles to do so while remaining in the Catholic Church. Vermigli embraced the Protestant doctrine of justification by faith alone during this time, and he had probably rejected the traditional Catholic view of the sacraments. Vermigli <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> to have influenced Valdés. Scholars believe that Valdés's strong doctrine of double predestination, that God has chosen some people for salvation and others for damnation, was learned from Vermigli. Vermigli in turn had acquired it from his study of Gregory of Rimini at Padua.|$|E
5|$|At Christmas, Kurt elects {{not to go}} back home, and so {{his father}} comes up to New York to set up his Christmas tree and {{spend some time with}} him. At this point, he tells Kurt that he has {{prostate}} cancer. He also has brought Blaine with him, who tries to win back Kurt's trust, but the trip is uneasy. When Kurt begins at NYADA, he struggles initially to find his place, and meets a student named Adam Crawford, a senior who wants to recruit him for his own show choir, Adam's Apples, and <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> interested in Kurt himself; Kurt eventually asks him out for coffee. While at Will and Emma's wedding, Kurt and Blaine hook up, leaving their relationship in a question, since Kurt is dating Adam, but not exclusive. When Kurt returns to New York, there is a snowstorm, leaving Kurt, Rachel, Santana, and Adam stuck together in the loft watching movies together. Santana strongly hints about Kurt's hook up with Blaine, and after they are back at school, Adam asks Kurt about his feelings for Blaine. Kurt says that he is desperately trying to get over Blaine, and Adam invites him to find their own romantic movie.|$|E
5|$|Before the 13th century, {{instances}} of Europeans going to China or of Chinese going to Europe are virtually unknown, {{with a few}} exceptions. Euthydemus I, Hellenistic ruler of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom in Central Asia during the 3rd century BC, led an expedition into the Tarim Basin (modern Xinjiang, China) in search of precious metals. Greek influence as far east as the Tarim Basin at this time <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> to be confirmed by {{the discovery of the}} Sampul tapestry, a woolen wall hanging with the painting of a blue-eyed soldier, possibly a Greek, and a prancing centaur, a common Hellenistic motif from Greek mythology. However, it is known that other Indo-European peoples such as the Yuezhi, Saka, and Tocharians inhabited the Tarim Basin before and after it was brought under Han Chinese influence during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC). Lucas Christopoulos presents an argument that the influence of Hellenistic art in China stretches back to the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC), before the establishment of the Silk Road. Christopoulos contends that Hellenistic influences in Chinese art were undoubtedly introduced by the period of the Three Kingdoms (220–265) and the sudden influx of Greco-Buddhist art from the Kushan Empire in Central Asia. Yet ancient ceramics from sites at Khotan bear clear influence from the Hellenistic Kingdom of Ptolemaic Egypt, with styles non-existent in Kushan art. This has led Christopoulos to assume the presence of peoples not only from the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom but also Greeks, Saka, and Indian people from the Indo-Greek Kingdom based at Taxila (Pakistan).|$|E
