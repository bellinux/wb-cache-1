5|$|Danaus– Featured in God of War comic #3, {{he was the}} {{champion}} of Hermes that could magically command beasts. With the animals in his village dying of a plague, Danaus was forced to seek the Ambrosia. He was decapitated in battle by Barbarian Prince Alrik, who retained Danaus' head <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> still command beasts.|$|E
5|$|Martingales {{have many}} {{applications}} in statistics, {{but it has}} been remarked that its use and application are not as widespread <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be in the field of statistics, particularly statistical inference. They have found applications in areas in probability theory such as queueing theory and Palm calculus and other fields such as economics and finance.|$|E

5|$|Both {{dogs and}} horses are {{susceptible}} to the gastrointestinal side effects associated with salicylates, {{but it is a}} convenient treatment for arthritis in older dogs, and has shown some promise in cases of laminitis in horses. It is no longer commonly used for cases of laminitis, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be counterproductive for treatment. Aspirin should be used in animals only under the direct supervision of a veterinarian; in particular, cats lack the glucuronide conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin, making it potentially toxic. No clinical signs of toxicosis occurred when cats were given 25mg/kg of aspirin every 48 hours for 4 weeks.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the North Carolina {{class was}} slowed by the {{aforementioned}} material issues, the changes {{made to the}} basic design after this date—namely the substitution of 16-inch for 14-inch guns—and the need to add both length and strength to the slipways already present in the navy yards. Increased use of welding was proposed as a possible way to reduce weight and bolster the structural design, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have reduced the ships' structural weight by 10%, but it was utilized in only about 30% of the ship. The costs associated with welding {{and an increase in}} the time of construction made it impractical.|$|E
5|$|Dreadnoughts tripod {{foremast}} {{was positioned}} behind the forward funnel {{to allow the}} vertical leg {{to serve as a}} support for the boat-handling derrick. This meant that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable in conditions of little or no wind. The Bellerophons had the foremast moved forward of the funnels to reduce the problem in the spotting top and a second tripod mast was added to handle the derrick, but it had to be positioned in front of the aft funnel to do that, which rendered the aft spotting top almost useless <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be exposed to the exhaust plumes from both funnels under certain circumstances.|$|E

5|$|During the war the Wallenberg bank, Stockholms Enskilda Bank {{collaborated with}} the German government. The Secretary of the US Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr. {{considered}} Jacob Wallenberg strongly pro-German, and in 1945 the US Federal Bureau of Investigation subjected the Bank to a blockade from engaging in business in the United States that was only lifted in 1947. Author Alan Lelchuk who interviewed, amongst others, Wallenberg's KGB interrogator, has speculated that the more powerful of the family may {{have chosen not to}} use their influence to locate Raoul <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have drawn attention to their misdeeds, and they may have considered him an embarrassment, not only for being a man of morality, but his possible homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Following the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantines {{were left}} in an {{unstable}} position. The capture of Constantinople in 1261 and subsequent campaigning did not come at a good time — the weakening of the Sultanate of Rum resulted in many beyliks breaking away as autonomous states, such as the Emirate founded by Osman I. Although this weakening of power gave the Empire of Nicaea a temporary free hand, it {{was nothing more than}} a small respite not capitalized as much <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have been.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Transport for London {{announced}} {{its intention to}} close one lane in each direction on Euston Road between 2020 and 2026 to accommodate work on High Speed 2. The decision was condemned by Camden Borough Council <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> affect business and cost more than £1 billion in lost revenue. The Automobile Association said the works were the largest ever proposed in London and would affect far more than local traffic due to its Inner Ring Road status.|$|E

5|$|In May 1916 the Australian Government {{offered the}} British Army Council a sixth {{division}} of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF), the Australian Army's main expeditionary force during World War I. This offer was an element {{of an attempt to}} establish an Australian and New Zealand Army, though the Australian Government acknowledged that forming a sixth division could cause difficulties in providing sufficient reinforcements to replace the AIF's casualties from December 1916. In such an event, the government proposed breaking up the division to reinforce the five others. The Army Council declined this offer as it preferred Australia to raise only as many units <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> reinforce.|$|E

The Silurians cause holes {{to open in the}} earth, one of which consumes Amy. The Doctor and Rory capture one Silurian, Alaya (Neve McIntosh), and the Doctor instructs Rory and a local family to not harm Alaya, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> spark a war. He then takes Nasreen in the TARDIS to the Silurian civilisation to rescue Amy and a local boy.|$|E
5|$|It must {{be taken}} into account that Soviet T-26 was one the most modern tanks of the world when it arrived to Spain, and Soviet Army tank {{doctrine}} was really advanced. Unfortunately for the Spanish Government during these years Stalin decided to eliminate all those generals that supported modern tank warfare and sent to Spain the officers that he liked. This meant Soviet tanks potential was never exploited in Spain <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>could.</b>|$|E

5|$|Many German radio {{messages}} were encoded using the Enigma machine and other enciphering techniques and the codes were changed frequently. A team of code breakers stationed at Bletchley Park worked to break codes {{as quickly as}} possible to provide advance information on German plans and troop movements. British military intelligence code-named this information Ultra intelligence <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> only be provided to the top level of commanders. The Enigma code used by Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, Oberbefehlshaber West (Supreme Commander West; OB West), commander of the Western Front, was broken by the end of March. German intelligence changed the Enigma codes right after the Allied landings of 6 June but by 17 June the Allies were again consistently able to read them.|$|E
5|$|On 15 February 1500, Cabral was {{appointed}} Capitão-mor (literally Major-Captain, or commander-in-chief) of a fleet sailing for India. It {{was then the}} custom for the Portuguese Crown to appoint nobles to naval and military commands, regardless of experience or professional competence. This {{was the case for}} the captains of the ships under Cabral's command—most were nobles like himself. The practice had obvious pitfalls, since authority could as easily be given to highly incompetent and unfit people <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> fall to talented leaders such as Afonso de Albuquerque or Dom João de Castro.|$|E
5|$|The Celestial Masters {{believed}} that qi pervaded everything, {{and in order}} to achieve immortality, the correct balance of qi had to be present within the body. Having a poor quantity of qi in the body, would result in illness, and eventually death. Meditation could be used to restore qi to the body, but sex was to be avoided, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> result in the loss of qi. If there was the correct balance of qi within the body upon death, an adherent could 'feign death' and be reborn. If not, an adherent would be transported to an earthly prison where he would face eternal torment.|$|E

5|$|The {{destruction}} of the Tuileries Palace affected the aesthetic relationship between the Palais du Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> now be seen that the two structures {{were not on the}} same axis. The Palais des Tuileries had served to disguise the fact that the Palais du Louvre is skewed slightly (6.33°) relative to the Axe historique (also known as the Voie Triomphale), a seven-kilometre straight line of structures and thoroughfares, including the Place de la Concorde, Champs-Élysées, the Arc de Triomphe and the Grande Arche de La Défense.|$|E
5|$|The lack of armour on {{both ends}} of the design sparked controversy: after the former Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy Edward James Reed visited the ships under construction, he criticized this {{particular}} design feature, arguing that in case of damage to either end the entering water would have compromised the stability; the new Italian Minister of the Navy, Simone Pacoret di Saint-Bon, replied during a Parliament session that such an event was very unlikely, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> happen only if all the bulkeads of the watertight compartments were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} of reopening the Bergen Street lower level was {{looked at as}} part of the study for the reintroduction of F express service <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> reduce the impact of less local service at the busy station. The station, if reopened, would require significant and expensive reconstruction, including making the station ADA accessible, the reconstruction of platform stairs, improved lighting and communications, waterproofing and concrete repairs, among other things. The rehabilitation would cost $75 million, and therefore the lower level is not currently planned to be reopened.|$|E
