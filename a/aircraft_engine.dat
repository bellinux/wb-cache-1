5|$|Corrosion {{and heat}} {{resistance}} makes iridium an important alloying agent. Certain long-life <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine</b> parts {{are made of}} an iridium alloy, and an iridium–titanium alloy is used for deep-water pipes because of its corrosion resistance. Iridium is also used as a hardening agent in platinum alloys. The Vickers hardness of pure platinum is 56HV, whereas platinum with 50% of iridium can reach over 500HV.|$|E

5|$|Hansell left Guam on January 21, 1945. Unknown at the time, his {{precision}} daylight attacks had succeeded, {{first in}} Japan's immediate and inefficient dispersion of its <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine</b> industry, {{and later in}} terms of actual destruction caused by the final raid under his command. A more immediate legacy of his command was his creation, {{in conjunction with the}} U.S. Navy, of an effective air-sea rescue system that saved half of all B-29 crews downed at sea in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Howe was {{determined}} to support technologically advanced industries, and saw no reason why Canada should not continue to produce aircraft after the war. His Director-General for Aircraft Production, Ralph Bell, disagreed with him, noting that Canada had no <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine</b> manufacturer, and that {{despite the presence of}} manufacturing plants and skilled workers, there was no guarantee that they could sell their products. Nevertheless, Howe took steps to keep aircraft manufacturers in business, allowing the British Hawker Siddeley Group to take over Victory Aircraft as A.V. Roe Canada (Avro Canada), while Canadair was sold to the US-based Electric Boat Company (later General Dynamics).|$|E
5|$|By 1961, {{when all}} {{airframe}} maintenance at Laverton {{was transferred to}} Nos.2 and 3 Aircraft Depots, No.1 AD had serviced forty-two aircraft types throughout its existence. It continued to maintain aero engines, and began supporting telecommunications equipment as well. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine</b> repair facilities at No.1 AD were closed down in 1968. Staff were transferred to No.3 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, {{to prepare for the}} introduction of the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber to Australian service and concentrate on maintaining the new aircraft's engines. No.1 AD's focus thereafter shifted to ground support, manufacturing, installing, servicing and providing training for navigational, air traffic control, telecommunications and motor transport equipment used by the Air Force and other sections of Defence and government. From 1968 to 1977, the depot was organised into two components, Telecommunications Installation and Maintenance Squadron and Ground Equipment Maintenance Squadron. These were subdivided in February 1977 into Telecommunications Squadron (maintaining ground communications equipment for control towers, transmitters and receiving stations in Australia and the region), Radar Squadron (supporting surveillance systems at RAAF Bases Williamtown, Amberley, Townsville, Darwin and Pearce), Ground Equipment Maintenance Squadron (maintaining motor transport, and other ground-based mechanical and electro-mechanical systems), and Intermediate Level Maintenance Squadron (communications, navigation and other ground-based maintenance at Laverton, as well as spectrometric analysis of oil used by the RAAF in aircraft and other equipment).|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War {{the running}} of Gibb and Partners fell largely to Paton and James Guthrie Brown. Gibb and Partners gained {{a large number of}} {{government}} contracts and within a few weeks of {{the start of the war}} in September 1939 the workforce increased by 2000. Paton designed and sited several Royal Ordnance Factories; and in March 1940 travelled to Turkey to construct an iron and steel works there. Whilst in Turkey he was contracted to build emplacements to contain guns from mothballed battleships in the Dardanelles. The construction of the emplacements was completed but the guns would later be prevented from reaching the site by the Axis occupation of Greece. Paton made his way back to Britain via Greece, Italy and France and arrived home two days prior to the Italian declaration of war against the Allies on 10 June 1940. He also constructed a plant at Barry in South Wales for the extraction of Magnesium Hydroxide from the sea, a turbine factory for British Thomson-Houston Company and a £7 million underground <b>aircraft</b> <b>engine</b> factory. From 1943-44 Paton supervised the construction, in London Docks, of the precast concrete caissons required for the construction of Mulberry Harbours following the Normandy Landings. From 1944-45 he was in charge of the rebuilding of houses damaged by V-2 rockets in the London districts of Wanstead and Woodford.|$|E

50|$|An Air Start Unit is {{a device}} used {{to start the}} <b>aircraft's</b> <b>engines</b> when the <b>aircraft's</b> APU is not operational. There are three primary types of these devices that exist currently: a stored air cart, a gas turbine based unit, and a diesel engine driven screw {{compressor}} unit.
