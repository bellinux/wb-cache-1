40|$|To prevent {{chromosome}} mis-segregation, the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint {{causes a}} mitotic arrest in cells containing unattached kinetochores through inhibition of CDC 20 -dependent APC/C activation. The robustness of the checkpoint {{is illustrated by}} the fact that the occurrence of even one single unattached kinetochore is sufficient to induce a mitotic arrest. Intriguingly, the checkpoint is <b>almost</b> <b>immediately</b> inactivated <b>after</b> the attachment of the last kinetochore. In this review, the mechanisms for this checkpoint silencing are discussed...|$|R

With these improvements in place, the R.IV flew again in May 1916. Even then, the engines overheated until one of the cylinders turned blue.|$|R

5|$|In October 1941, Reggie {{was offered}} a post as {{lecturer}} at Farouk University in Alexandria. The couple moved from Cairo to share a flat with fellow teacher Robert Liddell.

The emotional upset this caused prevented her from writing novels for several years.|$|E
50|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance first developed during September 13 and September 14 over the warm waters south of Acapulco. On September 15, the EPHC first classified {{the system as}} a tropical depression. Rapidly moving towards the west, the depression was embedded in deep easterly flow. The system attained tropical storm intensity on 1800 UTC September 16, thus received the name Madeline. After turning towards the west-northwest, Tropical Storm Madeline accelerated. It began a slow intensification trend, and peaked as a high-end tropical storm on 0600 UTC September 18. An upper-level low introduced strong wind shear, and Madeline began to fall apart <b>almost</b> <b>immediately</b> thereafter. <b>After</b> turning towards the north, and slowing down, Madeline dissipated on September 22.|$|R
25|$|No {{sooner had}} he {{published}} his theological lectures (the Theologia Summi Boni) than his adversaries {{picked up on}} his rationalistic interpretation of the Trinitarian dogma. Two pupils of Anselm of Laon, Alberic of Rheims and Lotulf of Lombardy, instigated proceedings against Abelard, charging him with the heresy of Sabellius in a provincial synod held at Soissons in 1121. They obtained through irregular procedures an official condemnation of his teaching, and Abelard was made to burn the Theologia himself. He was then sentenced to perpetual confinement in a monastery other than his own, {{but it seems to}} have been agreed in advance that this sentence would be revoked <b>almost</b> <b>immediately,</b> because <b>after</b> a few days in the convent of St. Medard at Soissons, Abelard returned to St. Denis.|$|R

5|$|In {{her first}} year of service, Australia visited as many major Australian ports as {{possible}}, to expose the new navy to the widest possible audience and induce feelings of nationhood: naval historian David Stevens claims that these visits did more to break down state rivalries and promote the unity of Australia as a federated commonwealth than any other event. During late 1913, footage for the film Sea Dogs of Australia was filmed aboard the battlecruiser; the film was withdrawn <b>almost</b> <b>immediately</b> <b>after</b> first screening in August 1914 because of security concerns.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Planica event and following numerous near-flat ground landings, it became clear that ski flying had once again outgrown an older hill and needed enlarging in the years to come. In 2005, <b>almost</b> <b>immediately</b> <b>after</b> the conclusion of the World Cup season, talks were under way to upgrade the hill in Vikersund. This became a reality in mid-2010, when the FIS announced major rule changes at the 47th International Ski Congress in Antalya, Turkey, to allow for ski flying hills to be constructed to their largest sizes yet.|$|E
5|$|Kraft again {{found himself}} a spectator during the landing of Apollo 11, which he viewed from Mission Control, sitting with Gilruth and George Low.
