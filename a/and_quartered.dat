5|$|As Warden, and {{afterwards}} Master, of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20 {{percent of the}} coins taken in during the Great Recoinage of 1696 were counterfeit. Counterfeiting was high treason, punishable by the felon being hanged, drawn <b>and</b> <b>quartered.</b> Despite this, convicting even the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult.

5|$|The Tichbornes, of Tichborne Park near Alresford in Hampshire, were an old English Catholic {{family who}} had been {{prominent}} in the area since before the Norman Conquest. After the Reformation in the 16th century, although one of their number was hanged, drawn <b>and</b> <b>quartered</b> for complicity in the Babington Plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth I, the family in general remained loyal to the Crown, and in 1621 Benjamin Tichborne was created a baronet for services to King James I.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Harclay was richly {{rewarded for}} his loyal and {{competent}} performance at Boroughbridge. On 15 March he was created Earl of Carlisle, and promised lands worth 1000 marks yearly. Yet Harclay, {{who had turned}} down Lancaster's overtures {{to join in the}} rebellion, was no great adherent of the King. As a warden of the Scottish Marches he grew constantly more frustrated with the King's idleness, and eventually negotiated a peace treaty with the Scots. This action on Harclay's part amounted to treason, and early in 1323 he was apprehended by the King's men, and hanged, drawn <b>and</b> <b>quartered.</b>|$|E
5|$|One {{of the two}} {{surviving}} Glastonbury chairs is {{on display}} in the palace. It was made in Britain from a description brought back from Rome in 1504 by Abbot Richard Beere to Glastonbury Abbey, and was produced for or by John Arthur Thorne, a monk who was the treasurer at the abbey. Arthur perished on Glastonbury Tor in 1539, hanged, drawn <b>and</b> <b>quartered</b> alongside his master, Richard Whiting, the last Abbot of Glastonbury, during the dissolution of the monasteries. The Abbot sat on a Glastonbury chair of this type during his trial at the Bishop's Palace. Other chairs of this age and later reproductions can also be seen.|$|E

5|$|St Michael's Church survived {{until the}} Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539 when, {{except for the}} tower, it was demolished. The Tor was the place of {{execution}} where Richard Whiting, the last Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, was hanged, drawn <b>and</b> <b>quartered</b> along {{with two of his}} monks, John Thorne and Roger James. The three-storey tower of St Michael's Church survives. It has corner buttresses and perpendicular bell openings. There is a sculptured tablet with an image of an eagle below the parapet.|$|E
5|$|The abbey {{was founded}} in the 7th century and {{enlarged}} in the 10th. It was destroyed by a major fire in 1184, but subsequently rebuilt and by the 14th century {{was one of the}} richest and most powerful monasteries in England. The abbey controlled large tracts of the surrounding land and was instrumental in major drainage projects on the Somerset Levels. The abbey was suppressed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries under King Henry VIII of England. The last abbot, Richard Whiting (Whyting), was hanged, drawn <b>and</b> <b>quartered</b> as a traitor on Glastonbury Tor in 1539.|$|E
5|$|The idea of anti-Ottoman {{struggle}} was revived by John III the Terrible (15721574) {{who refused to}} pay the tribute to the sultan. As a result, Ottoman and Wallachian troops invaded Moldavia, but they were defeated by John III in a surprise attack near Jilişte. Now the sultan sent a large army against Moldavia, and the prince was captured <b>and</b> <b>quartered.</b> Next Aaron the Tyrant joined the anti-Ottoman coalition of Transylvania and Wallachia, and started a rebellion on November 13, 1594, simultaneously with Michael the Brave of Wallachia.|$|E

5|$|The {{morning after}} the battle, forty young noblemen from Besançon, {{suspected}} of sympathizing with the Protestant insurgents, were executed after lengthy torture sessions. Other citizens suspected of heresy would receive the same punishment—some were imprisoned; others were banished from the city, or had their money and possessions taken away. Many citizens were publicly hanged {{in front of the}} city hall. Some Protestants were hanged, beheaded, <b>and</b> <b>quartered,</b> while some others were dragged onto a publicly displayed pile of bodies. Some Protestant corpses were cut up and the pieces exposed on the city gates. Masses were held at St. Jean's Cathedral and St. Stephen's Cathedral of Besançon to celebrate the defeat of the Huguenots.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the main}} {{military}} leaders on the border to Scotland, Harclay became frustrated with Edward II's inactivity, particularly the humiliating English defeat at the Battle of Old Byland on 14 October 1322, which {{made it clear that the}} war could not be won. Harclay initiated negotiations with the Scots on his own accord, and on 3 January 1323, he signed a peace treaty with Robert the Bruce. The act was without royal sanction, and amounted to treason. The king issued an arrest order for the earl, and on 25 February Harclay was taken into the king's custody. He was arraigned before royal justices on 3 March, denied a hearing, and executed the same day. He was hanged, drawn <b>and</b> <b>quartered,</b> and the various parts of his body displayed in different parts of the country. Only after five years was he allowed a proper burial, but the conviction for treason was never annulled.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536, there were over 850 monasteries, nunneries and friaries in England. By 1541, there were none. More than 15,000 monks and nuns had been {{dispersed}} and the buildings had been seized by the Crown to be sold off or leased to new lay occupiers. Glastonbury Abbey was reviewed as having significant amounts of silver and gold as well as its attached lands. In September 1539, the abbey was visited by Richard Layton, Richard Pollard and Thomas Moyle, who arrived there without warning on the orders of Thomas Cromwell. The abbey was stripped of its valuables and Abbot Richard Whiting (Whyting), who had been a signatory to the Act of Supremacy that made Henry VIII the head of the church, resisted and was hanged, drawn <b>and</b> <b>quartered</b> as a traitor on Glastonbury Tor on 15 November 1539.|$|E

5|$|During the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685, the Duke of Monmouth {{was welcomed}} {{when he passed}} through Shepton Mallet, staying in Longbridge House in Cowl Street {{on the night of}} 23 June, with his men {{quartered}} throughout the town, before setting out for Bristol the following day. Many Shepton men joined the cause, but Monmouth failed to take Bath or Bristol and had to return to Shepton on 30 June. Following the Battle of Sedgemoor, the Duke fled and spent the night of 6 July at Downside, a mile north of Shepton, before continuing his flight for two more days before his capture. Following the Bloody Assizes, twelve local supporters of Monmouth were hanged <b>and</b> <b>quartered</b> in the Market Place of the town.|$|E
5|$|Following these killings, Spanish garrisons were {{stationed}} in several towns in southern Yucatán, and rewards were offered for {{the whereabouts of}} AjK'in P'ol. The Maya governor of Oxkutzcab, Fernando Kamal, set out with 150 Maya archers to track the warleader down; they succeeded in capturing the Itza captain and his followers, together with silverware from the looted Sakalum church and items belonging to Mirones. The prisoners were taken back to the Spanish Captain Antonio Méndez de Canzo, interrogated under torture, tried, and condemned to be hanged, drawn <b>and</b> <b>quartered.</b> They were decapitated, and the heads were displayed in the plazas of towns throughout the colonial Partido de la Sierra {{in what is now}} Mexico's Yucatán state. These events ended all Spanish attempts to contact the Itza until 1695. In the 1640s internal strife in Spain distracted the government from attempts to conquer unknown lands; the Spanish Crown lacked the time, money or interest in such colonial adventures for the next four decades.|$|E
5|$|On 3 March, Harclay was arraigned {{before a}} royal justice in Carlisle, but was denied a proper hearing. He was brought forward apparelled in his robes of estate as a knight and earl. His spurs of knighthood were hewed off, and his sword was broken over his head. He was {{stripped}} of his robes, and proclaimed to be no knight, but a knave. He was then convicted as a traitor, and condemned to be hanged, drawn <b>and</b> <b>quartered.</b> He behaved with dignity at his execution, where he maintained that he had acted as he did {{out of concern for}} {{the best interest of the}} country. After his death, his head was taken to the king at Knaresborough in Yorkshire, before it was hung up on London Bridge. The four parts of his body were dispersed around the country, and displayed in Carlisle, Newcastle, Bristol, and Dover.|$|E
5|$|Although the Act of Parliament {{defining}} {{high treason}} {{remains on the}} United Kingdom's statute books, during {{a long period of}} 19th-century legal reform the sentence of hanging, drawing, <b>and</b> <b>quartering</b> was changed to drawing, hanging until dead, and posthumous beheading <b>and</b> <b>quartering,</b> before being abolished in England in 1870.

5|$|The peasants laid siege on Bern and Lucerne, whereupon {{the cities}} {{negotiated}} {{a peace agreement}} with the peasant leader Niklaus Leuenberger, the so-called peace on the Murifeld. The peasant armies retreated. The Tagsatzung, the federal council of the Old Swiss Confederacy, then sent an army from Zürich to definitely end the rebellion, and after the Battle of Wohlenschwil, the Huttwil League was forcibly annulled in the peace of Mellingen. The last resistance in the Entlebuch valley was broken {{by the end of}} June. After their victory, the city authorities took drastic punitive measures. The Huttwil League and the peace of the Murifeld were declared null and void by the city council of Bern. Many exponents of the insurrection were captured, tortured, and finally received heavy sentences. Niklaus Leuenberger was beheaded <b>and</b> <b>quartered</b> in Bern on September 6, 1653.|$|E
5|$|The {{plot was}} {{revealed}} to the authorities in an anonymous letter sent to William Parker, 4thBaron Monteagle, on 26October 1605. During {{a search of the}} House of Lords at about midnight on 4November 1605, Fawkes was discovered guarding 36barrels of gunpowder—enough to reduce the House of Lords to rubble—and arrested. Most of the conspirators fled from London as they learned of the plot's discovery, trying to enlist support along the way. Several made a stand against the pursuing Sheriff of Worcester and his men at Holbeche House; in the ensuing battle, Catesby was one of those shot and killed. At their trial on 27January 1606, eight of the survivors, including Fawkes, were convicted and sentenced to be hanged, drawn <b>and</b> <b>quartered.</b>|$|E
5|$|The rebel {{leaders were}} quickly rounded up. A rebel leader {{by the name}} of Jack Straw was {{captured}} in London and executed. John Ball was caught in Coventry, tried in St Albans, and executed on 15 July. Grindecobbe was also tried and executed in St Albans. John Wrawe was tried in London; he probably gave evidence against 24 of his colleagues in the hope of a pardon, but was sentenced to be executed by being hanged, drawn <b>and</b> <b>quartered</b> on 6 May 1382. Sir Roger Bacon was probably arrested before the final battle in Norfolk, and was tried and imprisoned in the Tower of London before finally being pardoned by the Crown. As of September 1381, Thomas Ingleby of Bridgwater had successfully evaded the authorities.|$|E
