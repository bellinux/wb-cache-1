5|$|The Boultons had two {{children}}, Matthew Robinson Boulton and Anne Boulton. Matthew Robinson in turn had {{six children}} with two wives. His eldest son Matthew Piers Watt Boulton, broadly educated {{and also a}} man of science, gained some fame posthumously for his invention of the important aeronautical flight control, the <b>aileron.</b> As his father before him, he also had two wives and six children.|$|E
5|$|All {{versions}} of the Su-25 have a metal cantilever wing, of moderate sweep, high aspect ratio and equipped with high-lift devices. The wing consists of two cantilever sections attached to a central torsion box, forming a single unit with the fuselage. The air brakes are housed in fairings {{at the tip of}} each wing. Each wing has five hardpoints for weapons carriage, with the attachment points mounted on load-bearing ribs and spars. Each wing also features a five-section leading edge slat, a two-section flap and an <b>aileron.</b>|$|E
5|$|Early {{aircraft}} {{suffered from}} leaks in wing fuel tanks that required re-sealing after each flight and 85 aircraft {{were found to}} have cracks in outer wing ribs and stringers. There were also problems with <b>aileron</b> control cylinders, electrical connectors, and engine compartment fires. Reconnaissance RF-4Cs made their debut in Vietnam on 30 October 1965, flying the hazardous post-strike reconnaissance missions. The USAF Thunderbirds used the F-4E from the 1969 season until 1974.|$|E
50|$|The B-52 Stratofortress {{also had}} {{spoilers}} augmenting small <b>ailerons,</b> known as feeler <b>ailerons.</b> These <b>ailerons</b> provided control {{forces to the}} pilot. The B-52G has no <b>ailerons.</b> The spoilers, situated inboard and forward of the trailing edge, are used for lateral control at high speeds to prevent excessive wing twist.|$|R
40|$|This report {{covers the}} sixth {{of a series}} of {{investigations}} in which various lateral control devices are compared with particular reference to their effectiveness at high angles of attack. The present report deals with flap-type <b>ailerons</b> hinged about axes having an angle with respect to the leading and trailing edges of the wing. Tests were made on four different skewed <b>ailerons,</b> including two different angles of skew and two sizes of <b>ailerons.</b> At the high angles of attack, all the skewed <b>ailerons</b> tested were slightly inferior with respect to rolling and yawing moments to straight <b>ailerons</b> having the same span and average chord. Computations indicate that the skewed <b>ailerons</b> are also inferior with respect to hinge moments...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{described in}} this report was made to determine the effectiveness of floating wing-tip <b>ailerons</b> as an airplane control in the spin. In these tests the <b>ailerons,</b> not being balanced, were set parallel to the axis of rotation, which is probably very nearly the attitude that balanced floating <b>ailerons</b> would assume in a spin. The tests were made with the spinning balance in the N. A. C. A. 5 -foot vertical tunnel. The model was tested with and without the <b>ailerons</b> in 12 spinning attitudes chosen to cover the probable spinning range. Rolling- and yawing-moment coefficients are given as measured for the model with and without the <b>ailerons,</b> and computed values are given for the <b>ailerons</b> alone. The addition of floating wing-tip <b>ailerons</b> to the model doubled the rolling-moment coefficient and increased the yawing-moment coefficient by 0. 05 and more. Both moments were in a sense to oppose the spin...|$|R
5|$|On 16 July 1964, Vulcan B.1A XA909 {{crashed in}} Anglesey after a midair {{explosion}} caused both No. 3 and No. 4 engines {{to be shut}} down. The explosion was caused by failure of a bearing in No. 4 engine. The starboard wing was extensively damaged, the pilot had insufficient <b>aileron</b> power, and both airspeed indications were highly inaccurate. The whole crew successfully abandoned XA909 and were found {{within a few minutes}} and rescued.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{into the}} crash by the Greek Air Force, and an {{independent}} investigator hired by Onassis, the Englishman Alan Hunter, concluded that it had occurred {{as a result of}} the reversing of the <b>aileron</b> connecting cables during the installation of a new control column. This cause was disputed by McGregor who believed that the wake turbulence from an Air France Boeing 727 that had taken off before them had caused the crash.|$|E
5|$|The story, set {{eighteen}} years after Destiny, follows Kyle Dunamis, {{the son of}} the previous game's protagonists Stahn <b>Aileron</b> and Rutee Katrea. Shortly after meeting a mysterious girl named Reala while trying to save Rutee's orphanage from bankruptcy, Kyle is drawn into conflict with Barbatos, a cruel warrior responsible for killing Stahn, and the machinations of Elraine, a religious leader seeking to bring peace to mankind. The gameplay uses two-dimensional character sprites and backgrounds, and the battle system is a revamped version of the series' trademark Linear Motion Battle System.|$|E
40|$|Report {{presents}} the results of flight tests comparing the relative effectiveness of conventional <b>ailerons</b> of the same size on wings of rectangular and tapered plan forms made with a Fairchild 22 airplane. Information is included comparing conventional and floating wing-tip <b>ailerons</b> on a tapered wing. The results showed that the conventional <b>ailerons</b> were somewhat more effective on the tapered than on the rectangular wing. The difference, however, was so small as to be imperceptible to the pilots. The floating wing-tip <b>ailerons</b> were only half as effective as the conventional <b>ailerons</b> and, for this reason, were considered unsatisfactory...|$|R

40|$|The {{available}} {{test results}} of internally balanced <b>ailerons</b> have been correlated and summarized herein. Although several variables have yet to-be-investigated, the results presented {{will be useful}} in the preliminary design of internally balanced <b>ailerons</b> and in {{the determination of the}} most promising modifications to unsatisfactory <b>ailerons...</b>|$|R
5|$|In air combat, the Phantom's {{greatest}} advantage was its thrust, which {{permitted a}} skilled pilot to {{engage and disengage}} from the fight at will. As a massive fighter aircraft designed to fire radar-guided missiles from beyond visual range, it lacked the agility of its Soviet opponents and was subject to adverse yaw during hard maneuvering. Although thus subject to irrecoverable spins during <b>aileron</b> rolls, pilots reported the aircraft to be very communicative and easy to fly {{on the edge of}} its performance envelope. In 1972, the F-4E model was upgraded with leading edge slats on the wing, greatly improving high angle of attack maneuverability at the expense of top speed.|$|E
5|$|The {{leading edge}} of the wing has a {{honeycomb}} structure panel construction, providing strength with minimal weight; similar panels cover the flap shrouds, elevators, rudders and sections of the fins. The skin panels are integral with the stringers and are fabricated using computer-controlled machining, reducing production time and cost. Combat experience has shown that this type of panel is more resistant to damage. The skin is not load-bearing, so damaged skin sections can be easily replaced in the field, with makeshift materials if necessary. The ailerons are at the far ends of the wings for greater rolling moment and have two distinguishing features: The ailerons are larger than is typical, almost 50 percent of the wingspan, providing improved control even at slow speeds; the <b>aileron</b> is also split, making it a deceleron.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong {{first saw}} {{action in the}} Korean War on August 29, 1951, as an escort for a photo {{reconnaissance}} plane over Songjin. Five days later on September 3, he flew armed reconnaissance over the primary transportation and storage facilities south of the village of Majon-ni, west of Wonsan. While making a low bombing run at about , Armstrong's F9F Panther was hit by anti-aircraft fire. While trying to regain control, he collided with a pole at a height of about , which sliced off about three feet (1 m) of the Panther's right wing. Armstrong flew the plane back to friendly territory, but due {{to the loss of}} the <b>aileron,</b> ejection was his only safe option. He planned to eject over water and await rescue by Navy helicopters, and therefore flew to an airfield near Pohang, but his ejection seat was blown back over land. A jeep driven by a roommate from flight school picked Armstrong up; it is unknown what happened to the wreckage of No. 125122 F9F-2.|$|E
40|$|Three model wings, {{two with}} typical slotted <b>ailerons</b> {{and one with}} typical frise <b>ailerons,</b> have been tested {{as part of a}} general {{investigation}} on lateral control devices with particular reference to their effectiveness at high angles of attack, in the 7 by 10 foot wind tunnel of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. Force tests, free-autorotation tests, and forced-rotation tests were made which show the effect of the various <b>ailerons</b> on the general performance of the wing, on the lateral controllability, and on the lateral stability, in general, rolling control at 20 degree angle of attack to plain <b>ailerons</b> of the same size. The adverse yawing moments obtained with the slotted and frise <b>ailerons</b> were, in most cases, slightly smaller than those obtained with plain <b>ailerons</b> of the same size and deflection. However, this improvement was small as compared to the improvement obtainable by the use of suitable differential movements with any of the <b>ailerons,</b> including the plain...|$|R
40|$|Discussed {{here are}} a series of {{systematic}} tests being conducted to compare different lateral control devices with particular reference to their effectiveness at high angles of attack. The present tests were made with six different forms of floating tip <b>ailerons</b> of symmetrical section. The tests showed the effect of the various <b>ailerons</b> on the general performance characteristics of the wing, and on the lateral controllability and stability characteristics. In addition, the hinge moments were measured for the most interesting cases. The results are compared with those for a rectangular wing with ordinary <b>ailerons</b> and also with those for a rectangular wing having full-chord floating tip <b>ailerons.</b> Practically all the floating tip <b>ailerons</b> gave satisfactory rolling moments at all angles of attack {{and at the same time}} gave no adverse yawing moments of appreciable magnitude. The general performance characteristics with the floating tip <b>ailerons,</b> however, were relatively poor, especially the rate of climb. None of the floating tip <b>ailerons</b> entirely eliminated the auto rotational moments at angles of attack above the stall, but all of them gave lower moments than a plain wing. Some of the floating <b>ailerons</b> fluttered if given sufficiently large deflection, but this could have been eliminated by moving the hinge axis of the <b>ailerons</b> forward. Considering all points including hinge moments, the floating tip <b>ailerons</b> on the wing with 5 : 1 taper are probably the best of those which were tested...|$|R

5|$|Delayed by {{the late}} {{delivery}} of its propeller, the first prototype was rolled out at Brough in February 1947 and then taken by road to RAF Leconfield where it made its maiden flight on 1 April that year. All three prototypes were completed {{by the end of}} September and the third prototype had been modified to reduce the outer-wing dihedral to 3 degrees. Both the second and third prototypes remained unflown when the Ministry of Supply ordered that flying be ceased and work on the aircraft be stopped. Later in the month, however, the third prototype was allocated to tests of powered <b>aileron</b> controls, as testing of the first prototype had shown that while adequate at cruise speed, the ailerons were heavy both at low and high speed. The second prototype was allocated to structural testing.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Records {{found that}} the plane {{did not respond to}} his control column. Even with the control column turned {{all the way to the}} left, {{commanding}} maximum left <b>aileron,</b> and pulled all the way back, commanding maximum up elevatorinputs that would never be used together in normal flight, commanding a roll to the left and the aircraft's nose to risethe aircraft was instead banking to the right with the nose dropping. Haynes attempted to level the aircraft with his own control column, then both Haynes and Records tried using their control columns together, but the aircraft still did not respond. Afraid the aircraft would roll into a completely inverted position (an unrecoverable situation), the crew reduced the left wingmounted engine to idle and applied maximum power to the right engine. This caused the airplane to slowly level out.|$|E
5|$|On 18 September 1932, Holden was {{travelling}} as {{a passenger}} aboard a New England Airways DH.80 Puss Moth from Sydney to Brisbane when it crashed at Byron Bay in northern New South Wales, killing him instantly. The other occupants, pilot Ralph Virtue {{and the joint}} owner of the Canberra, Holden's schoolfriend Dr George Hamilton, also perished. Investigations determined that the Puss Moth, VH-UPM, had gone down {{as a result of}} wing failure caused by <b>aileron</b> flutter. A crowded memorial service for Holden and Hamilton took place at Sydney Church of England Grammar School on 20 September; they were cremated that afternoon at Rookwood Cemetery, where eighteen aircraft piloted by friends and associates of the pair overflew the chapel. Holden was survived by his wife and children. His father Hubert carried on operating Holden's Air Transport Services, floating it as a public corporation and serving as chairman. Les Holden, George Hamilton, and one of their schoolmates who had also recently died, Henry Braddon, were commemorated with a memorial stained-glass window at the Sydney Church of England Grammar School chapel in 1934. Holden was also honoured by Holden Street, built in the Sydney suburb of Maroubra in 1943.|$|E
50|$|The Silent Club has light <b>ailerons,</b> light elevator, {{along with}} a generous rudder. The roll rate is quick due to the lively feel of the <b>ailerons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The P-61 did {{not have}} normal-sized <b>ailerons.</b> Instead, it had small <b>ailerons</b> which allowed wider span flaps and a very low landing speed. [...] These <b>ailerons,</b> known as guide <b>ailerons,</b> gave some roll control and {{provided}} acceptable feel for the pilot in rolling manoeuvres. Control of the aircraft about the roll axis was augmented with circular-arc spoilerons which provided about half the roll control at low speeds {{and most of it}} at high speeds. The spoilers were located outboard of the nacelle in front of the flaps.|$|R
40|$|Beveled <b>ailerons</b> were {{constructed}} with the bevel built up by spreading {{the upper and}} lower surfaces apart behind the hinge making a slight inside corner on each surface. During flight tests, it was noted that these <b>ailerons</b> showed a somewhat greater useful range of deflections and gave slightly better control at low speed than did original <b>ailerons...</b>|$|R

25|$|Matthew Piers Watt Boulton of Tew Park and Haseley Court, also {{published}} under the pseudonym M.P.W. Bolton (22 September 1820 – 30 June 1894), was a British classicist, elected {{member of the}} UK's Metaphysical Society, an amateur scientist and an inventor, {{best known for his}} invention of the <b>aileron,</b> a primary aeronautical flight control device.

25|$|In 1985, {{near the}} Sauk-Prairie airport shortly after takeoff, Alan was {{involved}} in a fatal mid-air collision where his airplane lost a portion of its wing, including half of the <b>aileron.</b> The other plane spun into the ground killing the pilot, but Alan was able to maneuver a landing back on the runway by keeping high airspeed and using full <b>aileron</b> deflection. From surviving this incident, Alan sought to make flying safer—ultimately leading to the brothers' pursuit of implementing a parachute on all their designs starting in the mid-1990s.|$|E
2500|$|The French journal L'Aérophile later {{published}} {{photos of}} Esnault-Pelterie's glider with its inter-wing <b>ailerons</b> in June 1905, and <b>ailerons</b> were then copied by other aircraft designers, with the interwing <b>ailerons</b> {{showing up on}} the final-flown revision of Alberto Santos-Dumont's 14-bis canard biplane on 12 November 1906, popularized by American pilot and aircraft designer Glenn Curtiss with his Golden Flyer first self-designed aircraft in 1909, and entering widespread use by 1915. [...] The Wrights, having vigorously fought others using any form of lateral flight control without the payment of onerous licensing fees to them, quietly changed their aircraft flight control systems from wing warping to <b>ailerons</b> at that time as well. It is unknown whether Esnault-Pelterie had seen Boulton's patent or reinvented <b>ailerons</b> independently.|$|R
25|$|From November 1940, a {{decision}} was taken that Supermarine would start producing light-alloy covered <b>ailerons</b> which would replace the original fabric covered versions. However, seven months after the decision was taken to install them on all marks, Spitfires were still being delivered with the original fabric covered <b>ailerons.</b> From May 1941 metal <b>ailerons</b> were fitted to all Spitfires coming off the production lines.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect of}} <b>ailerons</b> can be {{accounted}} for simply changing [...] term in Equation 3. For non-symmetric controls such as <b>ailerons</b> the [...] term changes {{on each side of}} the wing.|$|R
25|$|Initial trials {{revealed}} {{a lack of}} longitudinal control, and the single-acting ailerons caused problems when taxying downwind, so the two prototype were fitted with lengths of bungee cord attached to control horns on the upper <b>aileron</b> surface to return the <b>aileron</b> to the neutral position. This only produced a marginal improvement, so ailerons were then added to the lower wings, these being fitted to all the aircraft built apart from the two prototypes. These were linked by cables to the upper ailerons, and the bungee cord to return the ailerons was rigged between {{the top of the}} rear interplane struts and the lower ailerons.|$|E
25|$|During further testing, the {{prototype}} was destroyed on 23 August 1947 in a fatal crash on {{take off from}} Woodford which killed Roy Chadwick; air accident investigators later discovered that the crash was due to incorrect assembly of the <b>aileron</b> control circuit.|$|E

50|$|An {{early use}} of {{spoilers}} for augmenting small <b>ailerons,</b> known as guide <b>ailerons,</b> {{was in the}} Northrop P-61 Black Widow night fighter. The spoilers allowed wider-span flaps for a lower landing speed.|$|R
50|$|Roll is {{controlled}} by movable sections on {{the trailing edge of}} the wings called <b>ailerons.</b> The <b>ailerons</b> move differentially - one goes up as the other goes down. The difference in camber of the wing cause a difference in lift and thus a rolling movement. As well as <b>ailerons,</b> there are sometimes also spoilers - small hinged plates on the upper surface of the wing, originally used to produce drag to slow the aircraft down and to reduce lift when descending. On modern aircraft, which have the benefit of automation, they can be used in combination with the <b>ailerons</b> to provide roll control.|$|R
