5|$|M249s {{have seen}} action {{in every major}} {{conflict}} involving the United States since the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989. Due to the weight and age of the weapon, the United States Marine Corps is fielding the M27 Infantry <b>Automatic</b> <b>Rifle</b> with plans to partially replace the M249 in Marine Corps service.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Marine Corps {{tested the}} M27 Infantry <b>Automatic</b> <b>Rifle,</b> a lighter, magazine-fed rifle to {{supplement}} and partially replace the M249. With {{plans to buy}} up to 4,100 IARs to complement and partially replace its 10,000 M249s (of which 8,000 will remain in service) held at platoon level, it acquired 450 of the Heckler & Koch HK416–based weapons for testing. The Marines started fielding the M27 in 2010, but kept both weapons in the inventory due to the M249's greater ammunition capacity and higher sustained fire rate; rifle companies are typically issued 27 IARs and six SAWs. The U.S. Army does not plan to introduce the IAR. Colonel Robert Radcliffe of the U.S. Army Infantry Research and Development Center stated that an <b>automatic</b> <b>rifle</b> with a magazine would lower the effectiveness and firepower of a squad. While the Marine Corps has 13-man squads, the Army organizes its soldiers into squads of nine and needs considerably more firepower from the squad machine gunners {{to make up the}} difference. The U.S. Army does, however, want to replace aging M249s with newer weapons.|$|E
5|$|Hodgkinson {{worked his}} way around to the left towards the Indonesian line of approach, {{subsequently}} engaging and killing two more, and wounding a third. Guest gathered the right hand elements of 7 Platoon, hooking around Hodgkinson and counter-attacking the remaining Indonesians, killing the previously wounded soldier and one other. Yet another wounded Indonesian was observed to crawl away while the tenth proceeded to run off unharmed back in the direction from which the patrol had come. Within twenty minutes the contact was over and the Australians proceeded to collect the discarded Indonesian weapons and equipment, including a Browning <b>Automatic</b> <b>Rifle,</b> three MI rifles and 200 rounds of ammunition. Dressed in US steel helmets, green shirts and blue and khaki shorts, the Indonesian soldiers were subsequently identified as members of 440 Battalion.|$|E

5|$|The {{more typical}} soldier types of the Gorn are the Initiates, Warriors and Guardians. The former {{are the basic}} troops of the Gorn forces, and while they can run on four legs, they fight on two with an <b>automatic</b> <b>rifle</b> called the Ravager. The Warriors are more advanced, and carry a variety of {{weaponry}} along with basic armor. The Guardian type differs {{in that it is}} a melee type, armed with a large energy axe. However, the energy from the axe can also produce a shield to protect the holder as well. They are more advanced than both the Initiate and the Warrior classes in that they spend the vast majority of their time on two feet only. Of these fifteen classes, three were created to appear female.|$|E
5|$|Although the PVA 13th Army had {{a nominal}} {{strength}} of 230,000 men, its actual strength {{during the battle}} could be as low as 150,000 men. The PVA 66th Corps, for example, had only 6,600 men per division {{at the start of}} the battle, as opposed to the expected 10,000 men per division. There were also only one firearm available for every three Chinese soldiers, and the rest were employed as grenade throwers. Because most of the Chinese howitzers and guns were left behind in Manchuria, mortars were the only artillery support available for the Chinese. For the counteroffensive, the average Chinese soldier were issued with only five days worth of rations and ammunition, and resupply could only be obtained by scavenging on the battlefield. To compensate for its shortcomings, the Chinese relied extensively on night attacks and infiltrations in order to avoid the UN firepower. The primitive logistics system had also allowed the Chinese to maneuver over the rough hilly terrains, thus enabled them to by-pass the UN defenses and to surround the isolated UN positions. Because the Chinese had captured large numbers of Nationalist weapons during the Chinese Civil War, most of the Chinese weapons were composed of US made small arms such as the Thompson submachine gun, the M1 Garand rifle, the M1918 Browning <b>Automatic</b> <b>Rifle,</b> the bazooka and the M2 mortar.|$|E
5|$|Red Cloud, then a corporal, was manning {{a forward}} {{listening}} post {{in front of}} his company's command post position on the hill. In the middle of the night, he began hearing suspicious noises, before spotting a number of Chinese troops intent on surprising the Americans. Red Cloud raised an alarm and began firing on the advancing Chinese troops with an M1918 Browning <b>Automatic</b> <b>Rifle</b> (BAR). The assistant BAR man with him in their foxhole was killed by the Chinese returning fire. Red Cloud was then shot twice in the chest. In spite of these wounds and after being attended to by a company platoon medic, he refused to withdraw from his post, and continued to fire accurately on the Chinese troops which caused significant casualties among their advancing force. Crucially, his actions alerted his company to the impending attack, preventing an ambush. After he was hit again and attended to by the same medic, Red Cloud propped himself against a tree and continued to fire, exposing himself to intense Chinese fire. He was shot at least eight times in the firefight. Suffering from severe injuries and too weak to support himself, he ordered a soldier near him, to tie him upright to the tree using the soldier's web belt, and then ordered these men to withdraw with the other wounded men to the main positions. Eventually, the Chinese overran Red Cloud's position and the hill.|$|E

5|$|That {{night the}} North Koreans {{launched}} their coordinated offensive against the entire UN force. The NK 6th Division advanced first, hitting F Company {{on the north}} side of the pass on the Chungam-ni-Haman road. The ROK troops in the pass left their positions and fell back on G Company south of the pass. The North Koreans captured a 75mm recoilless rifle in the pass and turned it on American tanks, knocking out two of them. They then overran a section of 82mm mortars at the east end of the pass. South of the pass, at dawn, First Lieutenant Houston M. McMurray found that only 15 out of 69 men assigned to his platoon remained with him, a mix of US and ROK troops. The North Koreans attacked this position at dawn. They came through an opening in the barbed wire perimeter which was supposed to be covered by a man with a M1918 Browning <b>Automatic</b> <b>Rifle,</b> but he had fled. Throwing grenades and spraying the area with burp gun fire, the North Koreans quickly overran the position. Numerous officers and non-commissioned officers attempted to get the men back into line, but they would not follow these orders. In one instance South Korean troops killed their own company commander when he tried to stop them from escaping.|$|E
5|$|The new 3rd Army Ranger Infantry Company was {{formulated}} {{based on}} the Table of Organization and Equipment documents of Ranger units in World War II, all {{of which had been}} deactivated. The 3rd Ranger Infantry Company was organized into three platoons. A headquarters element of five men oversaw the platoons. However, due to lack of battalion support for clerical, transportation, supply and mess kitchen support, 3rd company had to acquire the personnel, vehicles, and other equipment needed to support their operations. This resulted in the involvement of considerably more highly trained personnel than the five called for by the TOE. Each platoon had three squads of ten men each, with a platoon sergeant and assistant platoon sergeant (a.k.a. platoon guide). Each squad had two fireteams of five men each and one man in each fireteam carried a M1918 Browning <b>Automatic</b> <b>Rifle.</b> The BAR was the largest weapon in the platoon. The 60mm M2 mortars, the 57mm recoilless rifles, and the M20 Super Bazookas were carried on the company M35 2½ ton cargo truck but seldom used. The company was authorized two vehicles; an M38 Jeep and an M35 2½ ton cargo truck. The company was more heavily armed than the Eighth Army Ranger Company but less in strength and fire power than standard infantry companies. Like the other numbered Ranger companies, its organization called for five officers and 107 enlisted men in three platoons.|$|E
5|$|Both {{factions in}} Day of Defeat: Source {{have access to}} six classes. Each class is {{designed}} with specific combat circumstances in mind, so that teams must use teamwork to succeed. The weapons and equipment carried by the classes {{are based on the}} weapons used by both the US Army and Wehrmacht during World War II. Some of classes are armed with pistols—the American M1911 or the German Walther P38—while others are equipped with trench knives or entrenching tools for melee combat. Grenades are carried by a number of classes, depending on their role in the game—riflemen are equipped with rifle grenades, the assault classes are armed with a single fragmentation grenade and a smoke grenade for providing concealment, while support classes have access to two standard fragmentation grenades. Riflemen are armed with the M1 Garand or the Karabiner 98 kurz and are designed for medium to long range combat, while the assault classes carries the M1 Thompson or the MP40 which are only effective in close quarters. The support classes are designed for medium range combat, equipped with either the M1918 Browning <b>Automatic</b> <b>Rifle</b> or the StG44. Snipers are used for attacking enemy targets from long range, and are consequently armed with the Springfield M1903 or the Karabiner 98k both equipped with long range scopes. Machine gunners carries the M1919 Browning or the MG42 to defend key locations on a level or to provide a base of fire for their team's advance. Machine gunners are required to deploy their weapons on bipods before firing in order to compensate for the machine gun's extreme recoil. The final class is armed with a Bazooka or a Panzerschreck, used in the game to displace enemy machine gun or sniper positions. This class is armed with either an M1 carbine or Mauser M712 to defend themselves with when moving.|$|E
