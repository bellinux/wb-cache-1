50|$|Immature {{chorionic}} villi <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> <b>and</b> {{have more}} central blood vessels; thus, the diffusion distance for gas <b>and</b> nutrient exchange <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>and,</b> therefore, placental function is impaired.|$|R

5|$|Goldman grouped four {{subspecies}} of couesi {{from the}} interior plateaus of central Mexico together—albiventer, crinitus, aztecus, and regillus. Three of those (albiventer from Jalisco, crinitus from the Distrito Federal, and aztecus from Morelos) were described by Merriam in 1901, and Goldman had himself described regillus from Michoacán in 1915. According to Goldman, aztecus is pale <b>and</b> large-toothed, crinitus <b>is</b> <b>large,</b> dark <b>and</b> large-toothed, regillus <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> dark, <b>and</b> albiventer <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> relatively pale.|$|R
5|$|Durian flowers <b>are</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> {{feathery}} with copious nectar, {{and give}} off a heavy, sour, and buttery odour. These features {{are typical of}} flowers pollinated by certain species of bats that eat nectar and pollen. According to research conducted in Malaysia in the 1970s, durians were pollinated almost exclusively by cave fruit bats (Eonycteris spelaea); however, a 1996 study indicated two species, D. grandiflorus and D. oblongus, were pollinated by spiderhunters (Nectariniidae) and another species, D. kutejensis, was pollinated by giant honey bees and birds as well as bats.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the adult male Eurasian sparrowhawk loses {{a small amount}} of weight while feeding his mate before she lays eggs, and also when the young <b>are</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> require more food. The weight of the adult female is highest in May, when laying eggs, and lowest in August after {{the breeding}} cycle is complete. A study suggested that the number of eggs and subsequent breeding success are dependent on the female maintaining a high weight while the male is feeding her.|$|E

50|$|The head is bifurcated, with slender tentacles {{and eyes}} in small bulges lateral {{to the base}} of tentacles. The siphon <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> {{protrudes}} over the head.

5|$|Fruit bodies can be {{inhabited}} by species of limoniid flies, such as Discobola marginata or Limonia yakushimensis, {{as well as}} several species of fungi-dwelling mites. The flies are hosts for the mites in a symbiotic association known as phoresis, whereby the mites are mechanically carried by its host. Mites are small and unable to migrate the relatively long distances between mushrooms without assistance; the insect hosts, in comparison, <b>are</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> can transfer the mites between their preferred feeding habitats.|$|E
5|$|Group 15A {{is located}} on an {{artificial}} platform formed by levelling a natural elevation. The group is formed of six structures, four of these <b>are</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> enclose a patio. Two smaller structures are located to the southeast and southwest. The group has been looted, recovered ceramics date to the Late and Terminal Classic.|$|E
5|$|In tarsiers, the sublingua {{does not}} have {{serrations}} along its tip and is much simpler and generalized in structure, making it clearly distinguishable {{from that of the}} lemuriform primates. The tarsier has a distinct plica mediana and its plicae fimbriatae <b>are</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> stick to the entire underside of the tongue. The plica sublingualis is also prominent.|$|E

5|$|Like all jumping spiders, M. inclemens has {{excellent}} vision. The main eyes, in the front-and-center position, <b>are</b> <b>large,</b> <b>and</b> {{are more}} acute {{than those of}} a cat and about 10 times as acute as a dragonfly's. The remaining three pairs of eyes are {{along the sides of}} the head, and work as motion detectors. The eyes are used for hunting, for avoiding threats and for finding and wooing mates. Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, and on other arthropods.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of sirenians {{is characterized by}} the appearance of several traits, which are found in all sirenians (monophyly). The nostrils <b>are</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> retracted, the upper-jaw bone contacts the frontal bone, the sagittal crest is missing, the mastoid fills the supratemporal fenestra (an opening {{on the top of the}} skull), a drop-like ectotympanic (a bony ring that holds the ear drum), and pachyosteosclerotic (dense and bulky) bones.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of {{slow lorises}} are forward-facing, which gives stereo vision. Their eyes <b>are</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> possess a {{reflective}} layer, called the tapetum lucidum, that improves low-light vision. It {{is possible that}} this layer blurs the images they see, as the reflected light may interfere with the incoming light. Slow lorises have monochromatic vision, meaning they see in shades of only one color. They lack the opsin gene {{that would allow them}} to detect short wavelength light, which includes the colors blue and green.|$|E

50|$|The head <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> robust with a {{complete}} head shield that does not approach the ears. The tomial sheath <b>is</b> <b>large,</b> <b>and</b> inside an alveolar ridge is distinct and well formed. The head is typically dark brown to grey above and, in females, is usually blotched with cream to white in the throat region.|$|R

5|$|The {{eyes of the}} octopus <b>are</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> {{are at the top}} of the head. They {{are similar}} in {{structure}} to those of a fish and are enclosed in a cartilaginous capsule fused to the cranium. The cornea is formed from a translucent epidermal layer and the slit-shaped pupil forms a hole in the iris and lies just behind. The lens is suspended behind the pupil and photoreceptive retinal cells cover the back of the eye. The pupil can be adjusted in size and a retinal pigment screens incident light in bright conditions.|$|E
5|$|The family Ardeidae {{contains}} the herons, egrets and bitterns. Herons and egrets are wading birds with long necks and legs. Herons <b>are</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> egrets are smaller. Bitterns {{tend to be}} shorter-necked and more secretive. Unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises, and spoonbills, members of the Ardeidae fly with their necks pulled back into a curve.|$|E
5|$|The neck {{vertebra}} {{referred to}} Hatzegopteryx sp. contains {{a number of}} traits that allow {{for it to be}} definitely identified as that of an azhdarchid. The centrum is relatively low, the zygapophyses <b>are</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> flattened, and the preserved portions of the neural spine indicate that it is bifid, or split into two.|$|E

5|$|Their eyes <b>are</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> covered {{entirely by}} a {{transparent}} secondary cornea. They are greenish at the base. A pair of prominent ridges (olfactory crests) are {{present on the}} ventral surface of the head at the rear edge of the eyes. The mouth area is supported by seven triangular flaps (buccal lappets), each with 0 to 7 suckers of less than 0.2mm in diameter and 18 to 25 teeth. The strong, curved, and short beaks (rostra) are mostly black to dark brown. The radula has seven rows of teeth.|$|E
5|$|This hamster {{is listed}} as of Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The {{population}} and distribution size <b>are</b> <b>large,</b> <b>and</b> no major or widespread threats to the species are known. However, {{the increasing number of}} livestock in the areas of distribution, such as the steppes of central Asia, some burrows are at a small risk of being destroyed. In arid areas of distribution, the reduction in the amount of water sources is also a minor concern. These hamsters are conserved in protected areas.|$|E
5|$|Aberrations in {{the shape}} of {{operculum}} have been observed. In a specimen from Vouvant in France, and another from a spring near Bar in Montenegro, a double rib was present, but the rib shield was reduced; in a specimen from Ohrid Lake, only the rib shield was reduced. Theodoxus fluviatilis can be distinguished from the other three mentioned species by having a rib pit, which is formed by the rib and the rib shield. The rib shield, and consequently a rib pit, are lacking in Theodoxus transversalis, Theodoxus danubialis and Theodoxus prevostianus. These three species differs in having, in addition to a rib, a peg, which is absent in T. fluviatilis. The visible soft parts of the animal are light yellow with a black head. The tentacles are greyish and long. The eyes <b>are</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> black; the foot is whitish.|$|E
