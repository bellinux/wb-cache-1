25|$|In the 19th century, the British {{established}} {{a number of}} botanical gardens.

25|$|A {{stronger}} form of saudade may be felt towards {{people and}} things whose whereabouts are unknown, such as old ways and sayings; a lost lover who is sadly missed; a faraway place where one was raised; loved ones who have died; feelings and stimuli one used to have; and the faded, yet golden memories of youth. Although it relates to feelings of melancholy and fond memories of things/people/days gone by, {{it can be a}} rush of sadness coupled with a paradoxical joy derived from acceptance of fate <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> of recovering or substituting what is lost by something that will either fill in the void or provide consolation.|$|E
25|$|Although World War II had {{interrupted}} {{production of}} the Ercoupe, general aviation manufacturers were enthusiastic about the prospects of a postwar aviation boom. Thousands {{of men and women}} were trained as pilots by the government, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> was that they would want to include flying in their civilian life. Production of the model 415-C resumed in 1945, and in 1946 alone 4,311 aircraft were produced and sold at a cost of US$2,665. This was the same price as in 1941. At its peak, ERCO was turning out 34 Ercoupes per day, operating three shifts per day. The aircraft was aggressively marketed through unconventional outlets such as the men's department of the Macy's department store chain.|$|E

Five hours out in the cruise South Carolina <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hope</b> turned south and two of the British frigates turned after them. Seagrove turned north, with Diomede in pursuit. She got close enough to fire a few shots, but the {{schooner}} sent out boats and towed into the wind. Eventually Diomede turned south to continue the main pursuit letting Seagrove get away. Whilst Diomede was chasing Seagrove, Constance, having never strayed from her course, had continued east and surrendered to Quebec and Astrea without pointless resistance. The British pursuit of South Carolina then continued through the night.|$|E

Palmerston conceived and executed the plan of a quadruple alliance of the constitutional states of the West {{to serve as a}} counterpoise to the northern alliance. A treaty for the pacification of the Peninsula was signed in London on 22 April 1834 and, although the struggle was somewhat prolonged in Spain, it accomplished its objective.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, WCW's {{first major}} {{pay-per-view}} event since Hogan's hiring, Bash at the Beach, saw the former WWF mainstay cleanly defeat Ric Flair for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The two {{had worked for}} the WWF at the same time from 1991 to 1992, and a feud was teased between them, but the big-money match originally planned for WrestleMania VIII was changed to Flair/Savage and Hogan/Sid. When WCW delivered the match, the event drew a high buyrate by WCW standards due to mainstream intrigue and hype. Despite being a critical and financial success, the glory would not last, as the Hogan/Flair feud would only result in one more match (at Halloween Havoc) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> for long-term effects on pay-per-view buyrates and ratings did not materialize. Turner management came to this realization when they checked up {{on the state of the}} company in mid-1995. Hence, Bischoff called Turner and requested a private meeting, which he was granted.|$|E

25|$|Despite its efforts, the Chester Police Department {{still has}} a {{strained}} relationship with its citizens {{which led to a}} probe in May 2016 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> was that it would change the relationship between the department and the community. The probe follows a March 2016 shootout that saw the department claiming the suspects fired first, but the residents of the area where the incident took place believed the police fired first. In June, the United States Department of Justice came to Chester to hear the concerns of the citizens and it heavily criticized the department, pointing out deficiencies within the department. The community gathered in the Widener University auditorium where incidents of illegal stop and frisk encounters, the lack of Spanish speaking members of the department, and police brutality were discussed. This was {{the first step in a}} 6-month program organized by the Department of Justice's Office of Community Policing. Recommendations will be made early in 2017 and a task force will be in Chester for two years to oversee any department changes.|$|E
25|$|The police {{plan was}} to move in at midnight on September 14 and evict the house while the squatters were still in their beds. In past evictions, the police did not assault a house until long after {{the moment of the}} deadline, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> was to take the squatters by {{surprise}} and minimize the time available for them to prepare their defense. A couple of days before the eviction was to take place, posters were hung up all over the city. The posters invited people to come to a demonstration in support of the house. The poster showed a large image of a burning car and the text said {{that it was a good}} idea to show up with your face masked. This did raise some eyebrows at police headquarters, but in the end the police estimated that it was just a coincidence and that nothing big was underway. The police also thought that since the demonstration was held at 10:00 pm on a Sunday, not many people would attend.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the ending}} of the British Raj in India, British {{interest}} in the Middle East remained strong: Britain had treaty relations with Jordan and Iraq and was the protecting power for Kuwait and the Trucial States, the colonial power in Aden, and the occupying power in the Suez Canal. Many right-wing Conservative MPs, organised in the so-called Suez Group, sought to retain this imperial role, though economic pressures made maintenance of it increasingly difficult. Britain did seek to maintain its huge military base in the Suez Canal zone and, in the face of Egyptian resentment, further develop its alliance with Iraq, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> was that the Americans would assist Britain, possibly through finance. While the Americans did co-operate with the British in overthrowing the Mosaddegh government in Iran, after it had nationalised British oil interests, the Americans developed their own relations in the region, taking a positive view of the Egyptian Free Officers and developing friendly relations with Saudi Arabia. Britain was eventually forced to withdraw from the canal zone and the Baghdad Pact security treaty was not supported by the United States, leaving Eden vulnerable to the charge of having failed to maintain British prestige.|$|E
