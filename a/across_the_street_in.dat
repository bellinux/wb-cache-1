5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, the building's {{exterior}} {{became increasingly}} dilapidated; among those {{concerned about the}} church's deterioration was Russian bard Vladimir Vysotsky, {{who lived in a}} house <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>In</b> the late 1970s the city considered renovating the building, possibly to use as a concert hall for organ recitals, or as a general cultural administration centre. These projects were never carried out due to resistance from the research institute.|$|E
5|$|J. Keijzer {{replaced}} de Vries {{after the}} latter's death in 1887 and headed {{the church for}} seven years. During his tenure, the church and surrounding grounds were expanded significantly. Construction of a multi-story presbytery began in the 1880s and completed on 1 August 1890. <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>in</b> 1888 the nuns established an elementary school, and they also began construction of a chapel for the convent, which was opened on 6 August 1892. During this period the church building received stained glass windows and new pews. Further construction continued into the 20th century. A pipe organ was installed in 1903; it was restored in 1993, but remains in poor condition. Also installed that year were carvings depicting the fourteen Stations of the Cross.|$|E

McCartney is barefoot and {{out of step with}} the other members. Apart from Harrison, the group are wearing suits designed by Tommy Nutter. To the left of the picture, parked next to the zebra crossing, is a white Volkswagen Beetle which belonged to one of the people living in the block of flats across from the recording studio. After the album was released, the number plate (LMW 281F) was stolen repeatedly from the car. In 1986, the car was sold at auction for £2,530 and in 2001 was on display in a museum in Germany. The man standing on the pavement to the right of the picture is Paul Cole (7 July 1911– 13 February 2008), an American tourist unaware he had been photographed until he saw the album cover months later. On the original cover, McCartney holds a cigarette; in 2003 several US poster companies airbrushed this cigarette out of the image, without permission from either Apple or McCartney.|$|E

25|$|Gore Park, whose western {{boundary}} is King and James Streets, {{formed the}} public square for the new settlement and has remained {{the centre of the}} city ever since. The original plot of land set aside for the courthouse has had four different buildings erected on it.

25|$|In 1997, the {{university}} decided to expand Kyle Field {{and build the}} Bernard C. Richardson Zone {{at the north end}} of the stadium. This necessitated the removal of the cemetery. After meeting with representatives of the Traditions Council, Student Senate, and E-2, the athletic department decided to create a temporary cemetery <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>in</b> Cain Park. Upon completion of the stadium addition in 1999, the graves were relocated to a permanent cemetery at the new, tree-lined Richardson Zone Plaza. Since the recent additions blocked the gravesites' view of Kyle Field, a miniature scoreboard was constructed on the outside of the stadium so that the dead mascots can still watch the Aggies play.|$|E

500|$|In 1914, the {{existing}} school was torn down and two new structures were built. Since schools were segregated at that time, a two-story brick building was constructed on Mimosa Boulevard {{to house the}} white students in grades 1 through 10, and a one-room wooden building was built on Pleasant Hill Avenue for black students in grades 1 through 7. [...] The Pleasant Hill facility {{also served as a}} meeting place for a local lodge and the Pleasant Hill Baptist Church until the church built its own facility <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>in</b> 1922.

[...] He then walked <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to enter the Scientology building, but was prevented from entering by three hired private security guards.

2500|$|The {{capture of}} the train, and the {{subsequent}} media broadcasts from both {{the government and the}} rebels proved to be a key tipping point in the revolution.

Mr. Garcia's new home had just been built right next to the train tracks and it served as Che's headquarters during the battle. Mr. Garcia was still living in his old house with his young family just <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>In</b> an effort to capture Che Guevara and in retaliation for the taking of the train, Mr. Garcia's new home was subsequently bombarded by Batista's army.
