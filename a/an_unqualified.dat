Meanwhile, the Allies grew doubtful, waiting for the Japanese to respond.

5|$|Managers in the Premier League are {{involved}} in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection, and player acquisition. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans. Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the UEFA 'B' and 'A' Licences. The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis (i.e. more than 12 weeks – the amount of time <b>an</b> <b>unqualified</b> caretaker manager is allowed to take control). Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment. Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker; examples include Paul Hart at Portsmouth and David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe's {{leadership}} of the Liberals was not, initially, <b>an</b> <b>unqualified</b> success; his local campaigning skills did not readily transfer to set speeches on national or international issues, and some sections of the party became restless. His engagement to Caroline Allpass, announced in April 1968, reassured those in the party who had reservations about his private life; others were shocked by Thorpe's emphasis on the political motivation for the marriage—worth five points in the polls, he opined to Mike Steele, the party's press officer. For much of 1968 Thorpe was untroubled by Scott, who had acquired new friends and, according to Bessell, had burned his Thorpe letters. His reappearance in November 1968, again penniless and without prospect of work, was particularly unwelcome to Thorpe, as he fought to establish his leadership credentials. Bessell provided immediate relief by resuming the weekly cash retainer, {{but this was a}} short-term respite.|$|E

5|$|Without {{the support}} of the Communists, the {{increasingly}} unpopular and destructive Confrontation quickly came to an end. Secret talks between Malaysia and Indonesia were held throughout late 1965 and early 1966, and a peace treaty was signed in August of the latter year. Sukarno was toppled from power by the generals on accusations of collaborating with the rebels and replaced by Suharto as President on 12 March of the following year. The conflict had been <b>an</b> <b>unqualified</b> success for Britain and the West, as she had subdued a rising Communist power in Asia and prevented the 'domino effect' from taking off. And from a purely tactical standpoint, it had been a strong performance from British troops and commanders, as they had managed to confine a brewing disaster on a Vietnamese scale to a relatively small bush war that had a relatively small human cost and stabilised a potentially dangerous political situation of South East Asia.|$|E

25|$|Lee was a {{fourth-generation}} Singaporean {{of ethnic}} Chinese ancestry Hakka descent.

Lee Kuan Yew's grandfather Lee Hoon Leong, was born in Singapore in 1871.

25|$|On July 11, 1764, the British {{government}} {{passed an}} order-in-council to permit Acadians to legally return to British territories, provided {{that they take}} <b>an</b> <b>unqualified</b> oath of allegiance. Some Acadians returned to Nova Scotia (which included present-day New Brunswick). Under the deportation orders, Acadian land tenure had been forfeited to the British crown and the returning Acadians no longer owned land. Beginning in 1760 much of their former land was distributed under grant to the New England Planters. The lack of available farmland compelled many Acadians to seek out a new livelihood as fishermen {{on the west coast}} of Nova Scotia, known as the French Shore. The British authorities scattered other Acadians in small groups along the shores of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. It was not until the 1930s, {{with the advent of the}} Acadian co-operative movements, that the Acadians became less economically disadvantaged.|$|E
25|$|His {{tenure in}} New York lasted between 1971 and 1977 {{and was not}} <b>an</b> <b>unqualified</b> success. The {{dependence}} on a subscription audience limited his programming. He introduced more key works from {{the first half of}} the twentieth-century and, with earlier repertoire, sought out less well-known pieces: in the 1972–73 season, for example, he conducted Schütz's Fili mi, Absolom and Haydn's L'incontro improvviso. He also liked to construct programmes out of extreme contrasts ("like a shower that runs hot and cold"): a concert in June 1974 began with Handel's Music for the Royal Fireworks and ended with Ligeti's Aventures via Mozart, Webern and Varèse. Performances of new music were comparatively rare. The players admired his musicianship but came to regard him as dry and unemotional by comparison with Bernstein, although it was widely accepted that he improved the standard of playing. He returned on only three occasions to the orchestra in later years.|$|E

40|$|Business and Workers: the Ciompi in Florence. The world "Ciompi" {{brings to}} mind the actors in a famous "uprising" which took place in Florence in 1378. A rich {{literature}} grew up revolving around the event, initiated by its contemporaries; but the social, structural and original reasons which sparked it off remain little known. Who were the people who dared rise up in revolt in "beautiful sweet" Florence? How did they live? In this article, the author examines the working conditions of these Florentine wool manufacturing laborers. In crossing an analysis of the accounts of a big wool manufacturer with the regulation sources and treatises on the art of wool-making, certain characteristics proper to thisgroup of workers can be brought out: their form of remuneration, and the rhythm and the technical and physical conditions of their work. <b>As</b> <b>unqualified,</b> interchangeable, massified, piece-work and hourly wage laborers, carrying out the most painful and repetitive of operations, their fate depended solely on productive necessites.

40|$|High-precision {{processing}} of materials with ultrafast laser pulses is drawing increasing attention as laser sources are finally {{catching up with}} industry requirements. In particular, very rapid progress has been achieved in ultrafast fiber lasers, which are popular {{as a result of}} their highly repeatable, environmentally robust performance, compact size and possibility to reach high average powers. Meanwhile, our understanding of the rich physics of ultrafast laser-material interaction remains incomplete, wherein lies new opportunities. A particularly exciting possibility concerns the use of groups of pulses, which are extremely closed in time. This changes the interaction physics drastically: <b>A</b> <b>unqualified</b> increase in laser repetition rate would result in severe heat accumulation and other undesirable effects. The average power can be kept at a desirable level by operating the laser in the so-called burst mode, whereby each burst contains a number of closely spaced pulses, benefiting from accumulative effects, while the bursts are repeated at much lower repetition rate. Under the right conditions, including keeping average power low enough to prevent excessive heat accumulation, relatively low peak powers for which plasma shielding and similar effects are reduced, ultrafast burst mode can lead to an order-of-magnitude increases in processing speed compared to uniform repetition rate operation of an otherwise identical laser source. © 2015 OSA...|$|R
