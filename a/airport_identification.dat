40|$|Security systems {{based on}} face {{recognition}} through video surveillance systems deserve great interest. Their use {{is important in}} several areas including <b>airport</b> security, <b>identification</b> of individuals and access control to critical areas. These systems are based either on the measurement of details of a human face or on a global approach whereby faces are considered as a whole. The recognition is then performed by comparing the measured parameters with reference values stored in a database. The result of this comparison is not deterministic because measurement results are affected by uncertainty due to random variations and/or to systematic effects. In these circumstances the recognition of a face {{is subject to the}} risk of a faulty decision. Therefore, a proper metrological characterization is needed to improve the performance of such systems. Suitable methods are proposed for a quantitative metrological characterization of face measurement systems, on which recognition procedures are based. The proposed methods are applied to three different algorithms based either on linear discrimination, on eigenface analysis, or on feature detection...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} drug {{enforcement}} agents conducting random security checks and interviews of travelers at the airport. These agents {{can be identified}} due to the items they wear such as a fanny pack, either around the waist or over the shoulder. They also carry an airport access identification card around the neck.

40|$|Security {{breaches}} involving badged airport employees 1 are {{a growing}} risk in today’s commercial aviation industry. Currently {{at almost every}} commercial airport in the United States, employees of airports, airlines, purveyors, and other tenants enjoy unfettered access to the <b>airport’s</b> Security <b>Identification</b> Display Area (SIDA), sterile, and secured areas. In recent years, {{there have been several}} high profile incidents deriving from this freedom of movement and lack of oversight which have resulted in the introduction of dangerous contraband into the aviation system. Several alternatives can be implemented to combat this problem. What is perhaps the most effective of these is also the most expensive: promulgating regulations that require 100 percent screening of all airport employees entering the SIDA. Other proposals include increasing background investigations into airport badgeholders, increasing penalties for violations of airport security rules as a means of preventing at-risk employees from ever obtaining a SIDA badge, or deterring such badgeholders from misusing their access media. Risks involving airport badgeholders grow more prevalent by the day. Immediate change and rulemaking is needed if our commercial aviation system is to remain as safe and secure as it is today...|$|R

He has {{information on a}} crime about to be perpetrated by a Serbian terrorist believed by the bureau to be dead. When the Serbian is recognized at the <b>airport</b> by facial <b>identification</b> software as Ranko Zamani (Jamie Jackson), the division head answers to Reddington’s demands {{in order to get}} his help catching Zamani. Reddington insists on working exclusively with Elizabeth Keen (Megan Boone), a profiler who had just been hired. Reddington knows quite a bit about Keen, which convinces her and the SAIC to acquiesce to Reddington’s plan. Zamani plans to kidnap and booby trap the daughter of a general responsible for destroying a chemical weapons factory that poisoned Zamani's family.|$|R
40|$|The {{security}} systems {{based on the}} face recognition through video surveillance systems are of great interest. Their use is important in several areas including <b>airport</b> security, <b>identification</b> of individuals, access control to critical areas and so on. These systems are based either on the measurement of parameters details of a human face or on a global approach considering the face as a whole. While {{in the first case}} values are associated to geometrical parameters on the face, in the second they are produced by the projection of the face images in a face space determined for example with a Principal or Independent Component Analysis. The recognition is then performed by comparison of the values obtained with those of a set of parameters stored in a database, or measurable by a reference image. The result of the comparison between the values measured and stored in the database is not deterministic because the two sets of values are affected by random type uncertainties. In these circumstances the decision on recognition of a face is certainly subject to a risk of being wrong just because of measurement uncertainty. Target of this paper is the proposal of a new approach for the quantitative assessment of the measurement uncertainty and consequently the risk in decision-making, based on the definition and identification of a model for the evaluation of the uncertainty in face related biometric measurements...|$|R

40|$|This article {{initially}} analyses {{the subject}} of bird strike of China civil aviation and introduces bird strike incidents in these years on quantity, damage, flight phase and height, season, time and other characters. Measures are subsequently presented which were taken by China civil aviation to reduce the hazard of bird strike and ensure aviation safety. First, regulations and advisory circular were issued to qualify and direct bird strike prevention at airports. Then, systematical research on bird strike prevention was done. Birdstrike Prevention Guidance Manual has been compiled to direct aerodrome, airlines, air traffic control and other agencies to cooperate on bird strike prevention. The book also directs personnel to conduct ecological environment investigation, identify dangerous birds and develop integrative bird strike prevention system at airports. Assessment Outline of Airport Wildlife Hazard Management was introduced to evaluate if effective measures had been taken at airports. Lastly, information system of bird strike prevention has been developed. Aves identification database provides several methods to identify birds and information of each birds’ figure and ecological characteristics. Time of inhabitation, quantity, level of danger and other information also can be gotten. Airport Birdstrike Prevention Information System establishes database to record and forecast bird condition by zone, which provides a useful tool of recording, analysis, forecast and management for airport personnel. The bird strike incident report system collects and analyses the information of national bird strike incidents and shares these materials. Finally, the future work of China civil aviation is mentioned, including developing requirements and materials for personnel training, establishing evaluation index system of equipment and technique on bird strike prevention to evaluate its efficacy at <b>airports,</b> bird <b>identification</b> and research on night-active birds’ detection and control, et...|$|R
40|$|NASA {{conducted}} {{a series of}} flight experiments at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport as part of the Low Visibility Landing and Surface Operations (LVLASO) Program. LVLASO is one of the subelements of the NASA Terminal Area Productivity (TAP) Program, which is focused on providing technology and operating procedures for achieving clear-weather airport capacity in instrument-weather conditions, while also improving safety. LVLASO is investigating various technologies to be applied to airport surface operations, including advanced flight deck displays and surveillance systems. The purpose of this report is to document the performance of the surveillance systems tested as part of the LVLASO flight experiment. There were three surveillance sensors tested: primary radar using Airport Surface Detection Equipment (ASDE- 3) and the Airport Movement Area Safety System (AMASS), Multilateration using the <b>Airport</b> Surface Target <b>Identification</b> System (ATIDS), and Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) operating at 1090 MHz.

40|$|Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (Prescott, AZ, USA) {{was awarded}} {{a grant from the}} William J. Hughes FAA Technical Center in October 1999 to develop and {{maintain}} a web site dealing {{with a wide variety of}} airport safety wildlife concerns. Initially, the web site enabled users to access related topics such as wildlife management (at/near <b>airports),</b> bird <b>identification</b> information, FAA wildlife management guidelines, education, pictures, current news, upcoming meetings and training, available jobs and discussion/forum sections. In April 2001, the web site was augmented with an on-line wildlife strike report (FAA Form 5200 - 7). Upon submittal on-line, “quick look” email notifications are sent to concerned government personnel. The distribution of these emails varies as to whether there was damage, human injuries/fatalities, and whether feather remains were collected and will be sent to the Smithsonian Institution for identification. In July 2002, a real-time on-line query system was incorporated to allow federal and local government agencies, airport and operator personnel, and USDA and airport wildlife biologists to access this database (which as of June 2005 contains 68, 288 researched strike reports added to at a rate of approximately 500 strike reports/month) to formulate strategies to reduce the hazards wildlife present to aviation. To date (June 2005), over 15, 000 on-line real-time queries were processed. In June 2004, ERAU was authorized to develop a graphical interface to this on-line query system. Current capabilities include mapping strikes (by species) on the US map, each of the contiguous 48 state maps (with AK and HI being added), and airport diagrams of the major metropolitan airports as well as the next 46 airports with the most reported strikes The latter capability depicts strikes by runway in plan as well as in elevation view. Currently under development is the ability to view time-sequenced strikes on the US map. This extensive graphical interface will give analysts the ability to view strike patterns with a wide variety of variables including species, seasons, migration patterns, etc. on US and state maps and airport diagrams...|$|R
