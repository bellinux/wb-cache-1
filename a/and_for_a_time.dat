5|$|A {{library was}} {{operating}} from the wooden church building by 1860. Patronage {{of the library}} had declined markedly by the 20th century and by the 1930s it was virtually unused. A mobile library began calling in the 1960s <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> called once per month. The bookmobile service was finally ended, for all places not only Whitemore, in 1998.|$|E
5|$|As {{the only}} stable {{long-term}} state in Europe during the Middle Ages, Byzantium isolated Western Europe from newly emerging {{forces to the}} East. Constantly under attack, it distanced Western Europe from Persians, Arabs, Seljuk Turks, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> the Ottomans. From a different perspective, since the 7th century, the evolution and constant reshaping of the Byzantine state were {{directly related to the}} respective progress of Islam.|$|E

5|$|Burnell {{was behind}} {{the efforts of the}} royal {{officials}} to enforce royal rights during his term of office as chancellor, including the implementation of the Quo warranto procedures. He also helped with the legislative and legal reforms of Edward's reign. During Burnell's tenure the chancellor's office and records became fixed in London rather than travelling with the king. Burnell went abroad on diplomatic missions for Edward, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> governed Gascony. He continued to enjoy the king's trust until his death in 1292; one historian has suggested that Burnell may have been the most important royal official of the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1944, {{his health}} had {{deteriorated}} {{to the extent}} that he was evacuated to Australia, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> was not expected to live. By early 1945 he had recovered sufficiently to be appointed to command the 6th Division. While flying to assume this new command, the RAAF Lockheed Hudson aircraft he was travelling in crashed into the sea, killing all on board.|$|E
5|$|Deeply {{shocked and}} {{upset by the}} accident, Wilbur {{determined}} to make even more impressive flight demonstrations; in the ensuing days and weeks he set new records for altitude and duration. In January 1909 Orville and Katharine joined him in France, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> they were the three most famous people in the world, sought after by royalty, the rich, reporters and the public.

5|$|Due to its {{originality}} and longevity, Winnie Winkle {{became a}} household name and an icon, inspiring even Pop Art artist Roy Lichtenstein. Winnie Winkle was reprinted in Dell Comics, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> her face appeared on a cigar box lid. In retrospect, Winnie Winkle is seen {{as one of the}} comic strips heralding a new, more independent role for American women after World War I.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, {{appreciation}} of Bashō's poems grew more fervent, and commentators such as Ishiko Sekisui and Moro Nanimaru {{went to great}} length to find references in his hokku to historical events, medieval books, and other poems. These commentators were often lavish in their praise of Bashō's obscure references, {{some of which were}} probably literary false cognates. In 1793 Bashō was deified by the Shinto bureaucracy, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> criticizing his poetry was literally blasphemous.|$|E
5|$|In 1685, the Duke of Monmouth led the Monmouth Rebellion {{in which}} Somerset people fought against James II. The rebels landed at Lyme Regis and {{travelled}} north hoping to capture Bristol and Bath, puritan soldiers damaged the west front of Wells Cathedral, tore {{lead from the}} roof to make bullets, broke the windows, smashed the organ and the furnishings, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> stabled their horses in the nave. They were defeated in the Battle of Sedgemoor at Westonzoyland, the last battle fought on English soil.

5|$|In 1809, Sharp {{was elected}} to {{represent}} Warren County in the Kentucky House of Representatives. During his tenure, he supported the legislature's election of Henry Clay to the U.S. Senate, {{the creation of a}} state lottery, and the creation of an academy in Barren County. He served on a number of committees, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> served as interim speaker of the house during the General Assembly's second session. He was re-elected in 1810 and 1811. By 1810, the county had nearly 12,000 residents. During the 1811 session, Sharp worked with Ben Hardin to secure passage of a bill to ensure that state officers and attorneys at law would not be involved in dueling. He also opposed a measure allowing harsher treatment of slaves.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this period that the MTO {{undertook}} an engineering review of the entire route in search of cost inefficiencies. Highways 416 and 407 were constructed during a recession in the mid-1990s. Highway407 became a tolled highway <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> it was mentioned in legislative debates that Highway416 would also be tolled, but ultimately this never happened. Instead, a hiatus in construction allowed engineers to evaluate inefficiencies in bridge and cross-section designs, as well as sensitive clay soils near Ottawa. This initiative led to a cost savings of over C$7 million {{and several of the}} unique design features located {{along the length of the}} freeway.|$|E
5|$|Maryland {{became a}} prime tobacco {{exporting}} colony in the mid-Atlantic <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> {{a refuge for}} Catholic settlers, as George Calvert had hoped. Under {{the rule of the}} Lords Baltimore, thousands of British Catholics emigrated to Maryland, establishing some of the oldest Catholic communities in what later became the United States. Catholic rule in Maryland was eventually nullified by the re-assertion of royal control over the colony.|$|E

5|$|The Old Court – New Court {{controversy}} was a 19th-century political {{controversy in}} the U.S. state of Kentucky in which the Kentucky General Assembly abolished the Kentucky Court of Appeals {{and replaced it with}} a new court.

5|$|The {{industrial}} developments, {{while they}} brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision {{for public health}} did not keep pace with them, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> living conditions {{in some of the}} towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis. The companies attracted rural workers, as well as immigrants from Catholic Ireland, by inexpensive company housing that was a dramatic move upward from the inner-city slums. This paternalistic policy led many owners to support government sponsored housing programs as well as self-help projects among the respectable working class.|$|E

5|$|Things {{changed when}} Ivan Basso's team came {{forward on the}} third climb {{of the day to}} set a much faster pace in the peloton, and Basso himself {{attacked}} and came free, with only Stefano Garzelli holding his wheel. They caught some members of the morning breakaway, as that group also splintered, but were eventually themselves caught. Danilo Di Luca launched an attack on the fourth climb of the day, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> he and Menchov were clear of the other GC contenders, but they were also caught — the top seven in the GC were unchanged after this stage.|$|E
