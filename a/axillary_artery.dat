The axillary block {{is also the}} safest of the four main approaches to the brachial plexus, as it does not risk paresis of the phrenic nerve, nor does it {{have the potential to}} cause pneumothorax. In the axilla, the nerves of the brachial plexus and the <b>axillary</b> <b>artery</b> are enclosed together in a fibrous sheath which is a continuation of the deep cervical fascia. The easily palpated <b>axillary</b> <b>artery</b> thus serves as a reliable anatomical landmark for this block, and the injection of local anesthetic close to this artery frequently leads to a good block of the brachial plexus. The axillary block is commonly performed due to its ease of performance and relatively high success rate.|$|E

40|$|Giant cell {{arteritis}} (GCA) is {{a systemic}} large vessel vasculitis, with extracranial arterial involvement described in 10 - 15 % of cases, usually affecting the aorta and its branches. Patients with GCA {{are more likely}} to develop aortic aneurysms, but these are rarely present {{at the time of the}} diagnosis. We report the case of an 80 -year-old Caucasian woman, who reported proximal muscle pain in the arms with morning stiffness of the shoulders for eight months. In the previous two months, she had developed worsening bilateral arm claudication, severe pain, cold extremities and digital necrosis. She had no palpable radial pulses and no measurable blood pressure. The patient had normochromic anemia, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 120 mm/h, and a negative infectious and autoimmune workup. Computed tomography angiography revealed concentric wall thickening of the aorta extending to the aortic arch branches, particularly the subclavian and <b>axillary</b> <b>arteries,</b> which were severely stenotic, with areas of bilateral occlusion and an aneurysm of the ascending aorta (47 mm). Despite corticosteroid therapy there was progression to acute critical ischemia. She accordingly underwent surgical revascularization using a bilateral carotid-humeral bypass. After surgery, corticosteroid therapy was maintained and at six-month follow-up she was clinically stable with reduced inflammatory markers. GCA, usually a chronic benign vasculitis, presented exceptionally in this case as acute critical upper limb ischemia, resulting from a massive inflammatory process of the subclavian and <b>axillary</b> <b>arteries,</b> treated with salvage surgical revascularization. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionBlunt {{trauma of}} the <b>axillary</b> and subclavian <b>arteries</b> is uncommon. Conventional surgery {{presents}} significant morbidity associated to the need of extensive exposure and challenging dissection through traumatized tissues. Endovascular treatment is an alternative that has increasingly been used in traumatic arterial injuries. This report presents three cases that were managed by endovascular techniques. MethodsWe report the cases of three patients with blunt traumatic injuries of the subclavian and <b>axillary</b> <b>arteries</b> who were treated at our Institution in 2013 with endovascular techniques. Each case presented distinctly, resulting from different traumatic mechanisms and the therapeutical approach was adapted accordingly. ResultsCase 1 : A 68 -year-old man was admitted with an acute limb ischemia of the left upper limb after a fall from his own walking height. A computerized tomography angiography demonstrated a dissection of the left subclavian artery. Resource to a proximal angioplasty with stent allowed {{the recovery of the}} limb perfusion fixating the flap. Case 2 : A 34 -year-old male who fell from a height of 8 m, with multiple costal arch fractures and the complete transection of the subclavian artery. In this case, a covered stent excluded the rupture. Case 3 : A 45 -year-old woman presented to our department with an acutely ischemic left upper limb with 3 days of progression after a distension of the scapuloh-umeral articulation. Although a digital amputation was ultimately necessary, hand-salvage was accomplished through thrombectomy and catheter-directed thrombolysis. ConclusionBlunt {{trauma of the}} axillosubclavian arteries is rare and its diagnosis may be challenging. Endovascular treatment of blunt traumatic injuries of the subclavian and <b>axillary</b> <b>arteries</b> is an alternative to traditional surgical treatment, which may be used solely or in combination with the latter to reduce invasiveness and improve outcome of arterial injuries...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that external-beam radiation induces a chronic impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation. BACKGROUNDRadiation therapy is used commonly in the treatment of cancer and is associated with an increased incidence of adverse vascular events related to the field of radiation, including stroke and myocardial infarction. As endothelial injury is central to the pathogenesis of vascular diseases, we hypothesized that radiotherapy induces arterial endothelial dysfunction. METHODSSixteen women with unilateral breast cancer who underwent standard external-beam radiation therapy to the breast and axilla > 3 years before enrollment and ten healthy women were studied. Vascular ultrasonography was used to image both the artery exposed to radiation and the contralateral artery. Flow-mediated, endothelium-dependent vasodilation and endothelium-independent vasodilation to nitroglycerin of both <b>axillary</b> <b>arteries</b> were measured. RESULTSEndothelium-dependent vasodilation was significantly impaired in the irradiated <b>axillary</b> <b>arteries</b> compared with the contralateral, nonirradiated arteries (− 0. 4 ± 0. 4 % vs. 3. 2 ± 0. 8 %, p < 0. 001) and also compared with control subjects’ arteries (− 0. 4 ± 0. 4 % vs. 2. 5 ± 0. 6 %, p < 0. 001). In contrast, endothelium-independent vasodilation was greater in the arteries that received radiation compared with the contralateral arteries (3. 8 ± 0. 5 % vs. 2. 0 ± 0. 4 %, p < 0. 05) and also compared with control arteries (3. 8 ± 0. 5 % vs. 2. 5 ± 0. 4 %, p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONSExternal beam radiation therapy impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation of conduit arteries, implicating a decrease in the bioavailability of nitric oxide. These abnormalities may contribute to the development of arterial occlusive disease and associated clinical events...|$|R

Ten dogs were implanted with single-branched stent-grafts; the other ten dogs were implanted with double-branched stent-grafts. The stent-grafts were implanted transluminally via the abdominal aorta. The branched limbs were caught and pulled into supra-aortic vessels using gooseneck snare wires introduced via the <b>axillary</b> <b>arteries.</b> The animals were euthanized 4 months after implantation. ResultsOne of the ten dogs implanted with a single-branched stent-graft died from failure of the implantation procedure, and two of the ten dogs implanted with double-branched stent-grafts died from failure of the procedure and excessive blood loss.
