The study involved a detailed chemical examination of four selected acid sensitive catchments from January to May 2004, viz.

Sampling sites varied as to the characteristics of their catchment, e. g. afforested, partially afforested, moorland and areas harvested of trees, allowing for comparisons of chemical data. It was demonstrated that streams draining afforested catchments were <b>artificially</b> <b>acidified</b> compared to non-forested streams. Statistical analysis rejected the null hypothesis (ANOVA: F > F Critical, T-Test: t stat > t Critical) that there was no significant difference in surface water chemical quality between afforested and moorland sampling sites and afforested and clearfelled sites. There were highly significant differences between afforested and moorland sites for pH, alkalinity, total aluminium, colour, TON, chloride and calcium at all catchments.

The pH was lowered from 4. 7 to 3. 2. Desorption of Ca and Mg and desorption or solution of Al dominated acid-neutralisation; Al mobilisation was more important later. The stream substrate released 4, 542 meq Ca, 1, 184 meq Mg, and 2, 329 meq Al over a 45 m long and 1 m wide stream segment; smaller amounts of Be, Cd, Fe, and Mn were released. Adsorption of SO 4 2 - and desorption of F ? occurred during the acidification phase of the experiment. The exchange reactions were rapidly reversible for Ca, Mg and SO 4 2 -; but not symmetric as the substrate resorbed 1083, 790 and 0 meq Ca, Mg, and Al, respectively, in a 4 -hour recovery period. Desorption of SO 4 2 -; occurred during the resorption of Ca and Mg. These exchange and dissolution reactions delay acidification, diminish the pH depression and retard recovery from episodic acidification.

This pro-cess known as ocean acidification might have severe effects on marine organisms and ecosystems. The present study ad-dresses the effect of ocean acidification on early developmen-tal stages, the most sensitive stages in life history, of the At-lantic herring (Clupea harengus L.). Eggs of the Atlantic herring were fertilized and incubated in <b>artificially</b> <b>acidified</b> seawater (pCO 2 1260, 1859, 2626, 2903, 4635 µatm) and a control treatment (pCO 2 480 µatm) until the main hatch of herring larvae occurred. The development of the embryos was monitored daily and newly hatched larvae were sampled to analyze their morphometrics, and their condition by mea-suring the RNA/DNA ratios. Elevated pCO 2 neither affected the embryogenesis nor the hatch rate. Furthermore the re-sults showed no linear relationship between pCO 2 and to-tal length, dry weight, yolk sac area and otolith area of the newly hatched larvae. For pCO 2 and RNA/DNA ratio, how-ever, a significant negative linear relationship was found. The RNA concentration at hatching was reduced at higher pCO 2 levels, {{which could lead to}} a decreased protein biosynthesis. The results indicate that an increased pCO 2 can affect the metabolism of herring embryos negatively. Accordingly, fur-ther somatic growth of the larvae could be reduced. This can have consequences for the larval fish, since smaller and slow growing individuals have a lower survival potential due to lower feeding success and increased predation mortality. The regulatory mechanisms necessary to compensate for effects of hypercapnia could therefore lead to lower larval survival. Correspondence to: C. Clemmese...|$|R

The conventional biodiesel production technology {{involves the use of}} alkaline catalysts and is therefore not compatible with large amounts of free fatty acids (FFAs) and moisture in the feedstock due to the formation of soaps that strongly affect the feasibility of glycerol separation by liquid–liquid splitting. A preliminary stage of acidity reduction is therefore necessary, for this process, if the starting material is characterized by a free acidity higher than 0. 5 % by weight often contained in cheaper feedstock which lowers the production costs.

Coelomic fluid acid-base status measures showed an accumulation of PCO 2 and a significant reduction in pH in all treatments compared with controls. Bicarbonate buffering was employed in all cases to reduce acidosis but compensation was unsuccessful even under moderate hypercapnia. Significant test dissolution was evident due to increases in magnesium ions under all pH treatments. The test is however, not thought to be a major source of bicarbonate ions for compensation. Results suggest that a reduction of surface water pH of below 7. 5 would be severely detrimental to the acid-base balance of this intertidal species of echinoid; despite its ability to tolerate fluctuations in carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCOi) and pH in the rock pool environment. A lack of respiratory pigment, poor capacity for ionic regulation and dependency on a magnesian calcite test make both intertidal and non-intertidal echinoids vulnerable to anthropogenic acidification. Geological sequestration leaks may result in dramatic localised pH reductions e. g. pH 5. 8. P. miliaris is intolerant of pH 6. 16 seawater and significant mortality is seen at pH 6. 63.

The experimental segments of the mire received S amendments since 1983, in amounts equivalent to the annual S deposition in the highest polluted areas of Canada and U. S. Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) was the predominant VSC released from the mire and varied largely with time and space (i. e., from 2. 5 to 127 nmol/m(sup - 2) h(sup - 1)).

Nitrate concentrations in WS 9 soil water increased for the first 3 years of fertilization, and then declined for another 2 years. After that time, the concentrations remained relatively constant at approximately 15 pequiv. -L-'; this period of low nitrate concentrations included 2. 3 years of fertili~ation followed by 8. 2 years of no fertili~ation. Stream-water nitrate concentrations from both water-sheds indicate they were in stage 2 of nitrogen saturation; however, the soil-water nitrate behavior observed within the setting of continued elevated nitrogen inputs {{is at odds with}} responses predicted in current nitrogen saturation theory.

To overcome problems related to the low conductivity of the samples investigated, olive oils were mixed with suitable amounts of the room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL), tri-hexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ([P 14, 6, 6, 6](+) [NTf 2](-)), which acted as a supporting electrolyte. Conditions for a reliable quantification of the acids were preliminarily investigated by performing voltammetric and chronoamperometric measurements in RTIL solutions containing oleic acid at different concentrations. Oleic acid (OA) was chosen as a model compound as it is the main component of the FFA content in olive oils. In order to establish the effect of oxygen on the electroanalytical responses, the reduction process of OA was investigated under both deoxygenated and oxygenated conditions. It was found that, in both situations, the current arising from the electrode process of OA depended linearly on the OA concentration over a wide range varying from 0. 1 % to 8 % OA (w/w). This range includes FFA values which can be found on all categories of commercially available oil samples, including extra-virgin, virgin and lampante oils. Voltammetric and chronoamperometric experiments were also performed in oil/RTIL samples <b>artificially</b> <b>acidified</b> (extra-virgin olive oils with known addition of oleic acid) and in natural olive oils from some commercial categories. The results obtained indicated that the electrochemical procedure developed was satisfactory in terms of both sensitivity and detection limits. The reliability of the proposed {{approach for}} the detection of FFA was finally assessed by comparison of the voltammetric/chronoamperometric values with those obtained by the official method for quantification of olive oil acidity, which is an acid/base volumetric titration...|$|R

40|$|Background: Lactobacillus gasseri CP 2305 (CP 2305) is {{a strain}} of Lactobacillus {{isolated}} from a stool sample from a healthy adult that showed beneficial effects on health as a paraprobiotic. In a previous study, we demonstrated that CP 2305 -fermented heat-treated milk modified gut functions more than <b>artificially</b> <b>acidified</b> sour milk. Thus, the regulatory activity of the former beverage was attributed to the inactivated CP 2305 cells. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to elucidate the contribution of non-viable paraprobiotic CP 2305 cells to regulating human gut functions. We thus conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded parallel group trial. Design: The trial included 118 healthy participants with relatively low or high stool frequencies. The test beverage was prepared by adding 1 × 1010 washed, heat-treated, and dried CP 2305 cells directly to the placebo beverage. The participants ingested a bottle of the assigned beverage daily for 3 weeks and answered daily questionnaires about defecation and quality of life. Fecal samples were collected and the fecal characteristics, microbial metabolite contents of the feces and composition of fecal microbiota were evaluated. Results: The number of evacuations and the scores for fecal odors were significantly improved in the group that consumed the CP 2305 -containing beverage compared with those of the group that consumed the placebo (p= 0. 035 and p= 0. 040, respectively). Regarding the fecal contents of microbial metabolites, the level of fecal p-cresol was significantly decreased in the CP 2305 group relative to that of the placebo group (p= 0. 013). The Bifidobacterium content of the intestinal microbiota was significantly increased in the CP 2305 group relative to that of the placebo group (p< 0. 008), whereas the content of Clostridium cluster IV was significantly decreased (p< 0. 003). The parasympathetic nerve activity of the autonomic nervous system became dominant and the total power of autonomic activity was elevated in the CP 2305 group (p= 0. 0401 and p= 0. 011, respectively). Conclusions: The continuous ingestion of heat-treated CP 2305 cells clearly affected intestinal functionality. This is the first report of sterilized Lactobacillus cells having a significant impact on the environment and functions of the intestinal tract. The observed effects might be due, at least in part, to the brain–gut interaction...|$|R
40|$|The outcrops, {{petrography}} and geochemistry of manganese deposits {{were studied}} at several {{sites on the}} Cape Peninsula (Skeleton Gorge, Kasteelpoort Path, Kommetjie and Hout Bay) {{as well as at}} Rooi Els {{on the opposite side of}} False Bay. The purpose of this study was to understand the origin and depositional history of these manganese deposits. Manganese ore samples contain between 16 and 86 wt% MnO, 0. 3 to 29 wt% Fe 2 O 3, 1. 2 and 5. 6 wt% K 2 O and a P 2 O 5 content of 0. 3 to 1. 8 wt%. The primary manganese oxide mineral present is cryptomelane (KMn 8 O 16). The iron and quartz content of bulk rock samples have a positive correlation, and a negative correlation to manganese. From the field data, petrography and chemistry by electron microprobe analysis, it was established that the method of deposition was lateral secretion and the deposits fit into Harrison’s (1998) manganese classification as a Type 1 deposit. Lateral secretion involves the reduction of manganese and iron oxides within the soil profile by <b>acidified</b> <b>rain</b> water, further leaching of oxides as reducing groundwaters flow through regolith and bedrock, and the eventual precipitation as oxides at groundwater seeps and springs. Field observations and the chemistry of water and rock samples support the lateral secret ion model in which the manganese and iron are chemically leached from the Peninsula Format ion quartzarenite sandstone bedrock and transported along fractures and faults to be deposited as oxides upon emergence at the surface. Minor surface coatings of iron and manganese oxides are ubiquitous in the study area but can become concentrated in locally historic economic deposits where the groundwater f low is focused by topography, aquitards and faults. Trace element composition of the manganese-rich deposits indicates that they are low-temperature, hydrogenous freshwater deposits. The proposed Eh - pH evolution of surface and ground water flow paths is consistent with the reduction of manganese and iron within the soil profile, and the precipitation of first iron and then manganese at springs and seeps. The Rare Earth Element (REE) pat terns suggest variable sources and transport of the manganese and iron. The manganese deposits of the Cape Peninsula are no longer economic but do provide insights into the remobilisation of metals by low temperature groundwaters during the process of lateral secretion...|$|R
25|$|Crops do not end {{up using}} all of the {{synthetic}} fertilizer it is fed. The remainder ends up polluting surrounding land. Some of it will evaporate into the air where it will <b>acidify</b> the <b>rain</b> and produce greenhouse gases. It will also seep into the groundwater or run off into nearby bodies of water, thus polluting the drinking water of nearby communities. Poor soil health resulting from overproduction, excessive fertilizer use and inappropriate application of fertilizer causes runoff and leaching. Runoff into forests or marine areas can alter the ecosystem by fertilizing some plan species and poisoning others. The result of toxic runoff from commodity agriculture surrounding the Mississippi River {{can be seen at}} the hypoxic zone where the river meets the Gulf of Mexico. Here, algae grow rampant as a result of nitrogen fertilizer runoff thereby suffocating the animal life.

40|$|The Tetras {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular groups of fishes that are kept in modern aquaria. The neon tetra, Paracheirodon innesi, is one of the most popular tetras in the world and they are the second highest fish {{imported}} to the U. S both in numbers of individuals and total value, second only to the Guppy, Poecillia reticulate. The production of neon tetra in Sri Lanka is inadequate to fulfill the demand in export market since efforts of aquarists in breeding them has failed in most instances. Commercial breeding is done successfully in other countries but breeding in small scale has also reported not successful. Water pH is recognized as the main factor affecting on neon tetra breeding and <b>artificially</b> <b>acidified</b> fresh water is recommended. Pairs of brood fish have routinely spawned in acidified, soft water at 25 0 C (pH, 5. 5 — 6. 5, adjusted with phosphoric acid; total alkalinity, 3. 2 mg 1 - 1 and total hardness, 6. 0 mg I-I, as CaC 03). Water was also conditioned with humic acids (0. 04 %). Water acidification is not a cost effective method for Sri Lanka and this study attempted to find an alternative low cost method to breed neon tetra in captivity. Twenty one glass aquarium tanks were settled inside the hatchery and rain water, river water and well water were used separately for the experiment. Temperature and the pH of water in each tank were recorded daily using a pH meter (EcoScan pH 5). Four sides of the tanks were covered with black polythene papers to control the light further. Brooders were introduced to the tanks (pair per tank) and after 24 hours the tanks were observed for the eggs. Brooders were removed from the tanks and 2 ppm methylene blue was added. Fry were started to feed with paramecium culture and fry were transferred to cement tanks after 10 days. Collected data were analyzed with Pearson Chi-Squire Test using Minitab 14 statistical package. The pH of rain water, river water and well water during the period of study were 6. 2 ± 0. 05, 8. 0 ± 0. 04 and 7. 5 ± 0. 05 respectively. Spawning and hatching were only observed in tanks filled with rain water. After the tetras were transferred to the cement tank, there was a 5 % of reduction of the population. The results of the study has shown that the rain water has a significant effect (P< 0. 05) on the breeding of neon tetra. The reported rearing pH of the neon tetra is 6. 9 — 7. 4 and the breeding pH of the neon tetra is 5. 5 — 6. 5. The tropical rain forests in South American countries where neon tetra originated also have low pH level, low light condition and moderate temperature. These findings are directly compatible with the recent findings about the neon tetra breeding. Breeding of neon tetra with rain water is possible in aquarium condition. Use of rain water is a low cost method to breed neon tetra rather than using expensive chemicals...|$|R
40|$|CHAOS (Complexation by Humic Acids in Organic Soils) is a {{quantitative}} chemical model of organic soils that incorporates complexation by the functional groups of humic substances and non-specific ion-exchange reactions. The {{two types of}} interaction are linked by the net humic charge, Z, which depends on the extents of proton and metal complexation, and which in turn determines ionic concentrations in the diffuse part of the electrical double layer, by a Donnan equilibrium. CHAOS was found to account satisfactorily {{for the results of}} acid-base titration experiments (pH range 3 – 5) with soil samples, giving reasonable simultaneous predictions of solution pH and concentration of A 13 +. Predictive calculations with CHAOS suggest that organic soils <b>acidified</b> by acid <b>rain</b> would respond on a time-scale of years-to-decades to reductions in rain acidity.

40|$|Abstract Egyptian medical papyri {{date the}} Santorini eruption, and {{reconcile}} the hitherto perceived dichotomy between archaeological/historical and scientific data. The medical documentation describes ailments, {{which can only}} have arisen from a volcanic source: ash fallout, <b>rain</b> <b>acidified</b> by ash, and a plume. Furthermore, the Egypt described by the medical texts matches {{the one in the}} series of so-called biblical plagues. This match in turn provides the length of time, 19 months, between the initial and final phases of the eruption, each phase contributing to the otherwise odd accumulation of sulfates spread over two consecutive biennia (1603 - 1600 BC) in Greenland's ice core. As a result, the initial phase of the eruption can be dated to August 21, 1603 BC, and the final one to March 1601 BC, in full agreement with the radiocarbon data (1627 - 1600 BC) based on the outermost ring on the branch of an olive tree killed by the eruption...|$|R
40|$|Samples of all rains in {{a period}} from October, 1998 to January, 1999 at Athens, Greece, were collected. The pH values of almost all of these rains {{clustered}} in a high range of 7. 0 - 7. 5, with no relation between pH and their SO 42 -, NO 3 - and Cl- contents. In addition, a few rains with low contents of chemical components similar to pure water also were observed, giving a pH (approx. 5. 5) of rain caused by dissolution of only atmospheric CO 2 in it. These {{results indicate that the}} level of air pollution of Athens by human activity has become lower during the last decade, restoring the neutral condition of rain in this area. Furthermore, the Ca contents and Ca/Mg ratios in these rains, as well as their chemical and isotopic behavior, suggest that particles of calcium carbonate taken in as dust act as a neutralizer of rains. The dust must be derived not only from the urban area of Athens but also from its environs or areas distant from it. Such a mechanism causing universally neutral rains throughout the rainy season at Athens must have worked as a natural safeguard against <b>rains</b> <b>acidified</b> naturally and <b>artificially</b> from ancient times up to recent years, keeping the remains of ancient Greece in a good state of preservation during such a long period.

40|$|Single event {{precipitation}} {{samples were}} collected at two sites in Newfoundland for stable isotopic analysis of nitrogen and oxygen of dissolved nitrate. Nitrate, the second largest <b>acidifying</b> component of <b>rain,</b> is formed during the oxidation of NO and NO₂, collectively known as NOx, {{as well as other}} nitrogen species. Both natural and anthropogenic sources exist, however fossil fuel combustion in power plants and vehicles are the main contributors of NOx to the atmosphere. Nitrogen isotopes of nitrate may give insight into the source of the atmospheric oxinitrogen species, while oxygen isotopes may provide information about the type of oxidation the NOx emissions have undergone. The isotopic signatures, in combination with chemical and meteorological data, were used to characterise the main controls of the nitrate in the precipitation. [...] The two sites chosen for this study represent different types of environments: St. John's is a marine/urban location, while McIvers is a marine/rural site with no major point sources in the area. St. John's precipitation samples generally displayed characteristics of oil combustion emissions from stationary sources (high V, Ni) with smaller inputs from the ocean. Samples collected at McIvers were not as strongly affected by inputs from fossil fuel combustion, and generally had stronger marine signatures along with wood combustion and vehicle emissions. However, several samples collected at this location did display characteristics of oil combustion as well as smelting processes, confirming that the site is affected by long range transport of pollutants from North America. [...] Nitrogen isotopes appear to be controlled by the source of the nitrogen emissions. Fossil fuel combustion in stationary sources results in δ¹⁵N values close to 0 ‰, vehicle NOx emissions range from - 2 to - 13 ‰, while natural sources such as soil and oceanic emissions can result in NOx with values as low as - 20 ‰. A seasonality in δ¹⁵N was observed at both sites, whereby samples collected during the warmer season (Apr. -Sept.) exhibited more positive δ¹⁵N values than those collected during the cold season (Oct. -Mar.). Chemical data revealed that both sites were affected more strongly by anthropogenic emissions during the warm months, while the influence of the ocean was dominant during the cold periods. [...] The oxygen isotopic composition of nitrate in this study appears to be controlled by atmospheric transformations of the oxinitrogen species, which are related to temperature. Summer samples, mainly oxidised by ozone, had more positive ¹⁸O signatures than their winter counterparts. There {{is no evidence that the}} δ¹⁸O of the nitrate in this study is controlled by the sources of the nitrate. [...] This study has provided valuable isotopic measurements of atmospheric nitrate. To the author's knowledge, the method used in this study for isolating and processing dissolved nitrate in precipitation for stable isotopic analysis had not been previously applied to single rain events, making this study unique. As well, it has shown through the combination of isotopic and chemical data how nitrogen isotopes of precipitation nitrate are controlled by sources, while the oxygen isotopes of these compounds are controlled by atmospheric oxidation processes...|$|R
