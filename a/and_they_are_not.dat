5|$|Due to {{the gradual}} {{evolution}} of the post of Prime Minister, the title is applied to early Prime Ministers only retrospectively; this has sometimes given rise to academic dispute. Lord Bath and Lord Waldegrave are both sometimes listed as prime ministers. Bath was invited to form a ministry by King George II when Henry Pelham resigned in 1746, as was Waldegrave in 1757 after the dismissal of William Pitt the Elder, who dominated the government during the Seven Years' War. Neither was able to command sufficient parliamentary support to form a government; Bath stepped down after two days, and Waldegrave after three. Modern academic consensus does not consider either man to have held office as Prime Minister, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> listed.|$|E
5|$|In {{modern times}} {{dosimetry}} is done very differently. Equivalent doses {{would not be}} reported in roentgen; they would be calculated with different weighting factors, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> considered as relevant to acute radiation syndrome as absorbed doses. Recent documents have made various interpretations of Slotin's dose, ranging from 287rad to 21sievert. Based on citations and supporting reasoning, the most reliable estimate may be a 1978 Los Alamos memo which suggested 10Gy(n) + 1.14 Gy(γ) for Slotin and 2 Gy(n) + 1.1 Gy(γ) for Daghlian. These doses {{are consistent with the}} symptoms they experienced.|$|E
5|$|Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) {{daughter}} CeCe {{is being}} christened, and Michael Scott (Steve Carell) has invited {{all the members}} of the office to the service, much to their disappointment. During the service, CeCe's dress is ruined when Jim changes her diaper. Jim scrambles to replace the gown, and CeCe is eventually baptized in an Arcade Fire T-shirt he found in the back of his car. At the end of the mass, the minister announces there will be a reception hosted by Jim and Pam, who panic because the reception was for family only <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> prepared for so many guests.|$|E
25|$|An {{earthquake}} in 1185 destroyed {{most of the}} structures; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> reconstructed.|$|R
50|$|Everywhere I went <b>they</b> thought I <b>was</b> an Iraqi, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> {{wrong in}} this.|$|R

5|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 20th century astronomers {{increasingly}} {{turned to}} computer-controlled telescopes and CCDs for hunting supernovae. While such systems are popular with amateurs, there are also professional installations such as the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope. Recently the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS) project has begun using a network of neutrino detectors to give early warning of a supernova in the Milky Way galaxy. Neutrinos are particles that are produced in great quantities by a supernova, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> significantly absorbed by the interstellar gas and dust of the galactic disk.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's parent company, Arsenal Holdings plc, {{operates}} as a non-quoted public limited company, whose ownership is considerably {{different from that of}} other football clubs. Only 62,219 shares in Arsenal have been issued, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> traded on a public exchange such as the FTSE or AIM; instead, they are traded relatively infrequently on the ICAP Securities and Derivatives Exchange, a specialist market. On 29 May 2017, a single share in Arsenal had a mid price of £18,000, which sets the club's market capitalisation value at approximately £1,119.9m. Most football clubs aren't listed on an exchange, which makes direct comparisons of their values difficult. Consultants Brand Finance valued the club's brand and intangible assets at $703m in 2015, and consider Arsenal an AAA global brand. Business magazine Forbes valued Arsenal as a whole at $2.0 billion (£1.4 billion) in 2016, ranked second in English football. Research by the Henley Business School also ranked Arsenal second in English football, modelling the club's value at £1.118 billion in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The Oddo–Harkins rule {{holds that}} {{elements}} with even atomic numbers {{are more common}} that those with odd atomic numbers, {{with the exception of}} hydrogen. This rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton {{and are more likely to}} capture another, thus increasing their atomic number. In elements with even atomic numbers, protons are paired, with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other, enhancing stability. All the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> as common as the elements with even atomic numbers adjacent to them (the noble gases and the alkaline earth metals) in the Solar System. The heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can only be synthesised in supernovae and not in stellar nucleosynthesis. Lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesised in both Big Bang nucleosynthesis and in stars: the Big Bang could only produce trace quantities of lithium, beryllium and boron due to the absence of a stable nucleus with 5 or 8 nucleons, and stellar nucleosynthesis could only pass this bottleneck by the triple-alpha process, fusing three helium nuclei to form carbon, and skipping over those three elements.|$|E
50|$|Argives: Citizens of Argos and {{neighbours}} of the Spartans, {{they had}} maintained their neutrality {{throughout the war}} <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> assisting in peace efforts (lines 475, 493). They receive mentions in other plays.|$|R
50|$|Homer {{receives}} 7 analog television stations: Because {{the stations}} are rebroadcast into Homer using repeaters, their channel numbers <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{the same in}} Homer <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> required {{to participate in the}} transition to digital television.|$|R
2500|$|Everyday use of bojagi {{declined}} in the 1950s, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> treated by Koreans as art objects until the late 1960s. In 1997, the [...] "Korean Beauty" [...] postage stamp series included four stamps featuring bojagi.|$|R

25|$|In the Vietnamese edition, {{the team}} that comes in last on non-elimination legs must come first in the next leg or be {{stripped}} of all their money, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> given any money {{at the start of}} the following leg.|$|E
25|$|Nudism is {{considered}} taboo in Nepal. Although {{there are no}} laws governing nudism, people may be detained, arrested and fined for public nudity. Nevertheless, many Hindu male sages practice nudism <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> legally detained. Nudist sages {{can be seen in}} Pashupatinath.|$|E
30|$|LS-MRI scans were {{performed}} for free, patients did not undergo any additional fee <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> thoroughly informed about their radiological and neurological conditions after any follow-up MRI scan <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> exposed {{to any kind}} of biological or psychological harm.|$|R
50|$|Although {{some say}} the first Akelarres where held in Classical Greece when women, naked and drunk, went up the {{mountain}} to celebrate parties without men, this identification <b>is</b> wrong, since <b>they</b> worshipped the God Dionysus <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> witches.|$|R
50|$|CYT006-AngQb did {{not reach}} Phase III studies because the {{antihypertensive}} effects were small compared to existing ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> reproducible across dosing schemes. Similar vaccines with modified immunogens and different adjuvants are being investigated.|$|R
25|$|Reading (40 miles) – The club's oldest rivals. Swindon first played {{competitive}} football against Reading in 1892. Due to Reading's {{movement through}} the leagues the rivalry has abated <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{considered to be}} a constant target for terrace chants.|$|E
25|$|Other colours occur occasionally, {{but are not}} {{acceptable}} for conformation showing, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> pursued by breeders who intend to breed show dogs. These colours include white, fawnequin, brindlequin, merle, merlequin, blue merle, chocolate and fawn mantle. The white Great Dane coloring is typically associated with vision and hearing impairment.|$|E
25|$|Formal neuropsychological {{assessment}} {{of children with}} Panayiotopoulos syndrome showed that these children have normal IQ <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> on any significant risk of developing cognitive and behavioural aberrations, which when they occur they are usually mild and reversible. Prognosis of cognitive function is good even for patients with atypical evolutions.|$|E
50|$|Children <b>were</b> <b>not</b> to eat eggs, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> to {{eat meat}} offered {{to them at}} other households, for it may be Nkut meat neither <b>were</b> <b>they</b> {{to go out in}} the heat of the midday sun, for they may accept food from Akut.|$|R
2500|$|Through the 1950s, {{their duties}} {{generally}} consisted as working as matrons {{in the jail}} system, or dealing with troubled youths working in detective assignments. [...] Rarely did they work any type of field assignment <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> allowed to promote above the rank of sergeant.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), God told Moses to {{apportion}} {{shares of the}} land according to population among those counted, and by lot. The Levite men aged a month old and up amounted to 23,000, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> included in the regular enrollment of Israelites, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> to have land assigned to them.|$|R
25|$|Of course, any {{consistent}} theory {{must have}} a model, so even within the minimal model of set theory there are sets that are models of ZF (assuming ZF is consistent). However, those set models are non-standard. In particular, they do not use the normal element relation <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> well founded.|$|E
25|$|When baptised, a {{child can}} get an {{additional}} name (baptismal name), especially {{if there is no}} saint who bears their name, so they take a name associated with a patron saint. In confirmation, children receive another given name, but it is not used. Both baptismal and confirmation names have religious significance only, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> on any official records.|$|E
25|$|The {{left side}} of figure 2.3.1 is the meta-process model of the Implementation phase. The four labels with a black shadow mean that these {{activities}} are closed concepts <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> expanded in this context. No arrows connect these four activities, meaning that these activities are unordered and the reporting {{will be carried out}} after the completion of all four activities.|$|E
25|$|These {{included}} excluding Africans {{from the}} West African Medical Service {{and saying that}} no European should take orders from an African, which {{had the effect of}} ruling out African doctors from serving with the army. Egerton himself did not always approve of these policies, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> strictly upheld.|$|R
30|$|In our study, senior nursing students’ {{knowledge}} of forensic nursing <b>was</b> insufficient <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> trained in this area.

25|$|Some {{city and}} state {{officials}} have simply sought to remove slums. This strategy for dealing with slums {{is rooted in the}} fact that slums typically start illegally on someone else's land property, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> recognized by the state. As the slum started by violating another's property rights, the residents have no legal claim to the land.|$|E
25|$|The Janamsākhīs (literally birth stories), are {{writings}} which {{profess to}} be biographies of Nanak. Although not scripture in the strictest sense, {{they provide a}} hagiographic look at Nanak's life and the early start of Sikhism. There are several—often contradictory and sometimes unreliable—Janamsākhīs <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> held in the same regard as other sources of scriptural knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Graduates of osteopathic {{medical schools}} in the United States (osteopathic physicians) should not be {{confused}} with osteopaths, who are trained in the European and Commonwealth nations. Osteopaths (the term used for non-American-trained practitioners who practice osteopathic manipulation) are not physicians. Their training is similar to physical therapy <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> licensed to prescribe medications or perform surgeries.|$|E
50|$|Coast of Atlanta is from Atlanta, GA {{and serves}} fresh local seafood. Coast of Atlanta was {{eliminated}} in week four in Fayetteville, AR, after three other trucks were parked at a thriving local farmer's market, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> allowed to park there. They lost out to Momma's Grizzly Grub by just $24.|$|R
50|$|Her {{images were}} so {{obviously}} critical that the Army impounded most of them, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> seen publicly {{for more than}} 50 years.
