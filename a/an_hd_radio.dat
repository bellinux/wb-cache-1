50|$|Gernsback made {{significant}} contributions to the growth of early broadcasting, mostly through his efforts as a publisher. He originated the industry of specialized publications for radio with Modern Electrics and Electrical Experimenter. Later on, and more influentially, he published Radio News, which would have the largest readership among radio magazines in radio broadcasting’s formative years. He edited Radio News until 1929. For a short time he hired John F. Rider to be editor. Rider was a former engineer working with the US Army Signal Corps and a <b>radio</b> engineer for <b>A.</b> <b>H.</b> Grebe, <b>a</b> <b>radio</b> manufacturer. However Rider would soon leave Gernsback and form his own publishing company, John F. Rider Publisher, New York around 1931.|$|R

2500|$|At 02:10 {{hours on}} 3 August, while {{cruising}} {{at an altitude}} of [...] about [...] off Rhodes, the No.3 engine suddenly began to vibrate violently. At 02:15 <b>h,</b> <b>a</b> <b>radio</b> message was sent to Nicosia giving the aircraft's position flying over the coastline of Rhodes. The No.3 engine soon detached from its mounts, hit and damaged the rear of the fuselage before dropping away. Ongoing vibrations subsequently led to the loss of control on the No.4 engine. As the aircraft quickly began losing altitude, the flight crew transmitted a three minute long distress signal at 02:22h and decided to make an emergency water landing, avoiding a risky landing in mountainous terrain. They chose a site off the coast of Fethiye in South-Western Turkey after spotting the flashing light of the Kızılada Lighthouse.|$|R

40|$|Model weak D-type {{ionization}} fronts {{are used to}} show that narrow <b>H</b> I <b>radio</b> recombination lines, such as those observed in the directions of several galactic H II regions, may be formed in the outermost layers of an ionization front bounding <b>an</b> <b>H</b> II region.

The recombination line strengths given by the models are compared with observed line strengths for the H II region NGC 2024, and the observed line profiles {{are found to be}} about twice as broad as the model profiles. Some likely explanations for the discrepancy are considered, particularly a variation in front velocity over the observing beam width (Stark broadening is ruled out) ...|$|R
