5|$|The {{limestone}} {{sculpture of}} Seneb {{and his family}} {{is part of the}} collection of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. It depicts Seneb and his wife sitting next to each other with their children in the lower register. Seneb is depicted sitting cross-legged on a block of stone with his arms folded in a position characteristic of a scribe. His wife Senet sits alongside him, wearing a long robe with long sleeves and a wig covering her natural hair, which can be glimpsed on her forehead. She encircles him with her arms in a gesture of affection and support. She is shown with <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> on her face to signify her contentment and happiness.|$|E
2500|$|Without {{hesitation}} {{and knowing}} {{the fate of}} his community hung on his answer, Reb Kalish told the translator (in Yiddish): [...] "Zugim weil wir senen orientalimâ€”Tell him [...] because we are Orientals." [...] The governor, whose face had been stern throughout the confrontation, broke into <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>smile.</b> In spite of the military alliance, he did not accede to the German demand and the Shanghai Jews were never handed over.|$|E
60|$|Mr Hatton {{shook his}} head with <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> of contemptuous incredulity.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} at him, and <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> {{sinister}} <b>smile</b> contracted her white face.|$|R
6000|$|... "So I see, an' ye look business-like," [...] {{answered}} the old woman, with <b>a</b> very <b>slight</b> <b>smile,</b> and <b>a</b> significant glance at our hero's costume.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{doubt you}} do; and I suppose {{you wish to}} sell your {{knowledge}} at the highest possible figure," [...] said Dean, with <b>a</b> very <b>slight</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> {{hovered over}} the other's lips, but he quickly {{controlled}} it.|$|E
60|$|He {{returned}} her gaze steadily, but {{shook his head}} with <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> flickered {{upon her}} lips. The man's adroitness always excited her admiration.|$|E
6000|$|... "My home," [...] {{said the}} hermit, with <b>a</b> very <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> {{and the air}} of a prince, as he turned towards his visitor and waved his hand towards it.|$|R
60|$|There was <b>a</b> very <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> {{upon her}} lips, the glimmer of {{something}} that was almost appealing, in her eyes. Granet {{took her hand and}} patted it kindly. Her response was almost hysterical.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see," [...] said Boardman, {{showing his}} teeth, fine {{and even as}} grains of pop-corn, in <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> sarcastic <b>smile.</b> [...] "Sort of poetical justice," [...] he suggested.|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> {{seemed to}} move {{the corner of the}} lip that was on his side.|$|E
60|$|He {{shrugged his}} shoulders. There was <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> upon {{his lips and}} his eyes twinkled.|$|E
60|$|Helen showed it. He {{glanced at}} the initials, and laid it down with <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
60|$|Sally {{listened to}} all this with <b>a</b> <b>slight,</b> slow <b>smile,</b> not much embarrassed, for she was {{accustomed}} to her father's outbursts, but with an easy modesty which was very attractive.|$|R
60|$|She paid no heed to this, {{except that}} he noticed her face now wore <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> {{constrained}} <b>smile</b> {{as she looked at}} him. She was shy. Still she continued to regard him curiously.|$|R
6000|$|She {{stood still}} with {{repulsion}} and uncertainty. Mr. Harby, large and male, with his overhanging moustache, stood by with <b>a</b> <b>slight,</b> ugly <b>smile</b> {{at the corner}} of his eyes. The woman went on insidiously, not quite human: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stood in}} {{the opening of the}} doorway looking at them, <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> upon his lips.|$|E
60|$|Mary cast {{down her}} eyes, and {{the corners of}} her mouth twitched as if with <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
60|$|After a {{while she}} ventured to speak of her own plans and hopes. He listened with <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I think {{everybody}} seems {{happy to be}} your guest," [...] she replied, parrying, as was her custom, with <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> kind <b>smile,</b> and <b>a</b> low, sweet, unembarrassed voice, any personal allusion from Lothair of unusual energy or ardor.|$|R
6000|$|... "I had a {{birthday}} last week," [...] he said, with <b>a</b> very <b>slight</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "I {{think that it}} affected me. One begins to wonder after one has passed middle age, not what there is to look forward to, but how much it is worth while enduring." ...|$|R
60|$|Emma {{looked at}} Edwin for a second, and, with <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> but perplexed <b>smile</b> of acknowledgment, passed on.|$|R
60|$|Her {{eyes were}} sparkling. Falkner withdrew his own with <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>smile,</b> {{and raised his}} rifle with {{provoking}} deliberation.|$|E
60|$|I {{closed the}} door. Lady Angela was {{lounging}} in my easy chair with <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> upon her lips.|$|E
60|$|The {{silence was}} prolonged. Then {{he glanced up}} to find her {{watching}} him with <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> curving her lips.|$|E
6000|$|Those {{were exactly}} my own foolish words, for which I could have beaten myself afterwards; but Mr. Castleford only gave <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> grave <b>smile,</b> and said, 'You mean that your brother's real defect is in courage, moral and physical.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} you over-rate my abilities," [...] he said, with <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> deprecating <b>smile.</b> [...] "But at any rate, please {{be sure of}} one thing. You could not have asked the advice of anyone more anxious to serve you." ...|$|R
60|$|It was at {{this point}} that {{interrupting}} his flow of talk to light his pipe but holding us with his eye he inquired whether we had known Powell. Marlow with <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> reminiscent <b>smile</b> murmured that he remembered him very well.|$|R
60|$|She moved {{aside to}} let him pass, and sat {{listening}} with <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> as she heard him moving about the room.|$|E
60|$|They {{heard the}} nurse at the door, and Philip hurriedly got up. The nurse entered. There was <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> on her lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "Young Jasper Eau-douce!" [...] said Lundie, <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> <b>smile</b> {{gathering}} {{around his}} usually stern mouth. [...] "Will that lad be of your party, Sergeant?" ...|$|E
60|$|She gave me <b>a</b> <b>slight,</b> odd <b>smile,</b> and ran back. Her {{face was}} long and sallow and her nose rather red. But her gloomy black eyes {{softened}} caressively {{to me for a}} moment, with that momentary humility which makes a man lord of the earth.|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>slight</b> but furtive <b>smile</b> {{struggled}} {{around the}} mortified {{mouth of the}} Carmelite, as {{he listened to the}} naive observation of his ingenuous pupil.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Blatherwick paused, and {{appeared}} to be troubled with <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> cough. The <b>smile,</b> which Wolfenden was not altogether able to conceal, seemed somewhat to increase his embarrassment.|$|R
