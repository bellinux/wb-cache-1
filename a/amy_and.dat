The Doctor celebrates his victory, but finds Kovarian had been scanning Melody and found traces of Time Lord DNA; the Doctor speculates that Melody had been conceived while <b>Amy</b> <b>and</b> Rory were in transit on the TARDIS. The Doctor provides an old Gallifreyan cot for Melody, claiming it was his own.|$|E
5|$|Florence Fuller {{was born}} in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, in 1867, a {{daughter}} of Louisa and John Hobson Fuller. She had several siblings, including sisters <b>Amy</b> <b>and</b> Christie, both of whom subsequently became singers.|$|E
5|$|Images of the First and Second Doctors are {{displayed}} on the Doctor's mirror device and printout from the TARDIS' typewriter. The episode presents these trips as the Doctor's compensation to Amy for her fiancé Rory Williams' death in the previous episode, which Amy herself does not remember since Rory was consumed by {{a crack in the}} universe and thus erased from time. Van Gogh is able to sense Amy's sadness at Rory's death, and the Doctor later accidentally addresses <b>Amy</b> <b>and</b> Vincent as <b>Amy</b> <b>and</b> Rory, respectively.|$|E

5|$|As the Doctor and {{geologist}} Nasreen Chaudhry arrive by TARDIS in {{the massive}} Silurian underground civilisation, they are captured and taken to the Silurian doctor, Malohkeh. The Silurians' hostility is increased when the Doctor recalls his previous meeting with a similar race of reptilian humanoids which were destroyed by humans, {{a reference to the}} Third Doctor in Doctor Who and the Silurians. Meanwhile, <b>Amy</b> <b>and</b> Mo escape from Malokeh's experimentation and Mo discovers his son, Elliot, sedated in a chamber and under observation. When Malokeh realises the Doctor is not human, the leader of the Silurian warrior caste, Restac, insists both the Doctor and Nasreen be executed and escorts them to a Silurian court; though <b>Amy</b> <b>and</b> Mo interrupt the trial with stolen weapons, they too are captured. Eldane, Restac's superior, is called in by Malohkeh and demands a halt to the hostilities.|$|E

40|$|Barley is an {{important}} crop {{for the production of}} malt and beer. However, crops such as rice and wheat are rarely used for malting. α-amylase is the key enzyme that degrades starch during malting. In this study, we compared the genomic properties, gene copies, and conserved promoter motifs of α-amylase genes in barley, rice, and wheat. In all three crops, α-amylase consists of four subfamilies designated amy 1, amy 2, <b>amy</b> 3, <b>and</b> <b>amy</b> 4. In wheat and barley, members of <b>amy</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>amy</b> 2 genes are localized on chromosomes 6 and 7, respectively. In rice, members of amy 1 genes are found on chromosomes 1 <b>and</b> 2, <b>and</b> <b>amy</b> 2 genes on chromosome 6. The barley genome has six <b>amy</b> 1 members <b>and</b> three <b>amy</b> 2 members. The wheat B genome contains four <b>amy</b> 1 members <b>and</b> three <b>amy</b> 2 members, while the rice genome has three <b>amy</b> 1 members <b>and</b> one <b>amy</b> 2 member. The B genome has mostly <b>amy</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>amy</b> 2 members among the three wheat genomes. Amy 1 promoters from all three crop genomes contain a GA-responsive complex consisting of a GA-responsive element (CAATAAA), pyrimidine box (CCTTTT) and TATCCAT/C box. This study has shown that <b>amy</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>amy</b> 2 from both wheat and barley have similar genomic properties, including exon/intron structures and GA-responsive elements on promoters, but these differ in rice. Like barley, wheat should have sufficient amy activity to degrade starch completely during malting. Other factors, such as high protein with haze issues and the lack of husk causing Lauting difficulty, may limit the use of wheat for brewing...|$|R

5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Matt Smith) and {{his companions}} Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and her husband Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) crash land in 1938 Berlin when the TARDIS is hijacked by <b>Amy</b> <b>and</b> Rory's childhood friend, Mels (Nina Toussaint-White). They accidentally save Adolf Hitler (Albert Welling) who was scheduled for torture by the Teselecta, a time-travelling justice department. When shot by Hitler, Mels unexpectedly regenerates into River Song, the grown version of <b>Amy</b> <b>and</b> Rory's child who had been taken away from them. As River is a criminal herself due to her future execution of the Doctor, the Teselecta pursue her instead, whilst the Doctor faces death from her poisoned lipstick.|$|E

5|$|Amy has non-playable {{roles in}} a number of other game plots. Her {{attraction}} to Sonic is useful to Cream and Blaze the Cat in Sonic Rush, since they are also looking for him. In Shadow the Hedgehog, Amy appears at Cryptic Castle to ask him to help her find Cream, who has not returned. In the game's final story, unlocked after the player reaches the rest of the endings, Amy admiringly cheers Shadow on. In the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog game, she mistakes Silver the Hedgehog for Sonic; when he tells her he is looking for someone, she insists on helping him. When Silver attacks Sonic, Amy finds them and blocks Silver's way (saving Sonic's life); he escapes, and Amy yells at Silver. She rescues Elise (who also likes Sonic, although Amy does not know this at the time) from confinement. In Sonic Lost World, <b>Amy</b> <b>and</b> Knuckles care for forest animals while Sonic and Tails rescue the animals' friends. The Deadly Six (the game's antagonists) control one of Eggman's machines to drain life from the world; <b>Amy</b> <b>and</b> Knuckles die, but are brought back to life when Sonic and Tails replenish it.|$|E
5|$|Amy {{is a major}} {{character}} in the Sonic the Hedgehog manga. She is the girlfriend of protagonist Nicky, whose alter ego is Sonic, and is unaware that they are identical.

In Sonic Adventures, a 1994 two-issue French comic book published by Sirène, Doctor Robotnik (Eggman) uses Amy as bait to lure Sonic.
