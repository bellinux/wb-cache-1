25|$|The planisphere was a {{star chart}} invented by Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī in the early 11th century. The {{astrolabe}} was invented in the Hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BC and is often attributed to Hipparchus. A combination of the planisphere and dioptra, the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several {{different kinds of problems}} in spherical astronomy. An astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer and gear-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan, Persia in 1235. Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe, an early fixed-wired knowledge processing machine with <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> <b>train</b> and gear-wheels, circa 1000 AD. The castle clock, a hydropowered mechanical astronomical clock invented by Al-Jazari in 1206, was the first programmable analog computer.|$|E
25|$|All 567 engines utilize forced induction, {{with either}} a Roots blower or a {{turbocharger}}. The turbocharger (a combination turbo-compressor system) follows EMD's innovative design that uses <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> <b>train</b> and over-running clutch to drive the compressor rotor during low engine speed, when exhaust gas temperature (and, correspondingly, heat energy) alone is insufficient to drive the turbine. At higher engine speeds, increased exhaust gas temperature is sufficient to drive the turbine and the clutch disengages, turning the turbo-compressor system into a true turbocharger. The turbo-compressor can revert to compressor mode momentarily during demands for large increases in engine output power. While more expensive to maintain than Roots blowers, the turbocharger significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions, while improving high-altitude performance. Additionally, EMD's turbo-compressor can provide a 50 percent increase in maximum rated horsepower over Roots-blown engines for the same engine displacement.|$|E
25|$|Turbochargers {{are also}} {{employed}} in certain two-stroke cycle diesel engines, which would normally require a Roots blower for aspiration. In this specific application, mainly Electro-Motive diesel (EMD) 567, 645, and 710 Series engines, the turbocharger is initially {{driven by the}} engine's crankshaft through <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> <b>train</b> and an overrunning clutch, thereby providing aspiration for combustion. After combustion has been achieved, and after the exhaust gases have reached sufficient heat energy, the overrunning clutch is automatically disengaged, and the turbo-compressor is thereafter driven exclusively by the exhaust gases. In the EMD application, the turbocharger acts as a compressor for normal aspiration during starting and low power output settings and is used for true turbocharging during medium and high power output settings. This is particularly beneficial at high altitudes, as are often encountered on western U.S. railroads. It is possible for the turbocharger to revert to compressor mode momentarily during commands for large increases in engine power.|$|E

500|$|Expressing the {{behaviour}} of {{a mechanical}} component as a two-port or multi-port with a transfer matrix {{is a useful}} thing to do because, like electrical circuits, the component can often be operated in reverse and its behaviour {{is dependent on the}} loads at the inputs and outputs. [...] For instance, <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> <b>train</b> is often characterised simply by its gear ratio, a SISO transfer function.

2500|$|A [...] "colossal" [...] crane of 60tons {{was later}} built at Keyham, with a cell plate {{stiffened}} by four cells.

Having {{the location of the}} pumps all {{at one end of the}} engine, called the accessory drive end, fitted very well into locomotive installation.
