By this time, Serb officers and soldiers were also deserting in significant numbers.|$|E
50|$|Its {{function}} is to spoof not only caller ID but every other aspect of <b>an</b> incoming <b>telephone</b> <b>call,</b> including ringing and DC line voltage. Typically, the user physically disconnects the target line from the telephone network, connects the vermilion box, and then proceeds to create <b>a</b> completely bogus <b>telephone</b> <b>call.</b>|$|R

5|$|Just before 05:00, as his rebels {{continued}} their search, Major Hatanaka {{went to the}} NHK studios, and, brandishing a pistol, tried desperately to get some airtime to explain his actions. A little over an hour later, after receiving <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> from the Eastern District Army, Hatanaka finally gave up. He gathered his officers {{and walked out of}} the NHK studio.|$|E
5|$|On 5 October 2010, a {{car bomb}} {{exploded}} outside {{a branch of the}} Ulster Bank on Culmore Road in Derry. Two police officers were slightly injured in the blast, which also damaged a hotel and other businesses. Several telephone warnings were received an hour prior to the blast allowing police to cordon off the area. The RIRA later claimed responsibility in <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> to the Derry Journal.|$|E
5|$|Ewbank {{learned of}} the {{television}} problems {{in the locker room}} when he received <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> from his wife congratulating him on a Jets victory – Lucy Ewbank assumed the fact {{that the end of the}} game was not shown meant New York had won. Her husband profanely informed her of the game result. She was not the only Jets relative deceived – cornerback Johnny Sample flew back east after the game on personal business, and when his father picked him up at Philadelphia International Airport, he congratulated his son on a Jets triumph.|$|E

5|$|Galland {{received}} <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> from Göring on 10 May 1941, requesting Galland {{to intercept}} a Messerschmitt Bf 110 flown by Rudolf Hess heading for Scotland. Galland {{was unable to}} launch a full fighter sweep. However, Hess' flight was far {{to the north and}} he reached Scotland crashing his aircraft. Galland sent out fighters to conduct some sweeps so he could honestly claim to have carried out his orders but it was nearly dark and Galland ordered his pilots unused to night flying to stand down.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three days Marseille's Staffel was rested and taken off flying duties. On 28 September Marseille {{received}} <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> from Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel asking to return with him to Berlin. Hitler was to make a speech at the Berlin Sportpalast on 30 September and Rommel and Marseille were to attend. Marseille rejected this offer, citing that he was needed at the front and had already taken three months' vacation that year. Marseille also said he wanted to take leave at Christmas, to marry his fiancée Hanne-Lies Küpper.|$|E
5|$|The {{case against}} Martin falters as {{evidence}} disappears and witnesses fail to identify {{him in a}} line-up. Black is approached by Pepper, Martin's self-appointed lawyer, who extends Black an invitation to join his legal practice. Martin later claims in court to have killed Bletcher. Elsewhere, another Millennium Group member, Mike Atkins (Robin Gammell), receives <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> from someone pretending to be Black. Meanwhile, Black suspects that the occult-oriented murder may have been committed to draw the Group, and Black, into the open again.|$|E

50|$|R2 line {{signalling}} {{is a family}} of protocols that govern the resource acquisition and resource release related to <b>a</b> two-party <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> attempt and, if successful, the establishment of <b>a</b> two-party <b>telephone</b> <b>call.</b> Although in the 1960s R2 {{line signalling}} was represented as electrical pulses on a two-wire or four-wire circuit, by the latter 1970s these analog electrical pulses also could be represented in digital form by a signalling DS0 channel in the trunk, which is normally channel 16 in an E1 trunk.|$|R
5|$|The log {{discusses}} <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> made at 3:26am on 7 August to Chelmsford police station. According to the prosecution, this is {{the telephone}} call {{known to have been}} made by Bamber, the same call that is entered in the event log. There was only one call that night to the police station about the shooting, the prosecution says, and it was made by Bamber at or just before 3:26am. Bamber's defence team argues otherwise. They say that the radio log is not a duplicate log of Bamber's call, but that it shows Nevill also telephoned the police that night.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{argued that}} Bamber {{had not received}} <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> from his father, that Nevill was too badly injured after the first shots to have spoken to anyone, {{that there was no}} blood on the kitchen phone that had been left off the hook, and that Nevill would have called the police before calling Bamber. They also argued that, had Bamber really received such a call, he would have dialled 999, alerted the farm workers, then made his way quickly there himself.|$|E
5|$|By 16:00 the 1st Light Horse Brigade had {{captured}} No. 2 redoubt, and Chaytor reported capturing buildings and redoubts on the left. After <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> between Chauvel and Chetwode, pressure {{continued to be}} exerted and an attack by all units took place at 16:30. The Ottoman garrison held on until the dismounted attackers were within , but by that time, {{there was no doubt}} that the Ottoman garrison was losing the fight, and they began to surrender in small groups. All organised resistance ceased ten minutes later and as darkness fell, sporadic firing petered out, while prisoners were rounded up, horses collected and watered at the captured wells. Then Chauvel rode into Magdhaba and gave the order to clear the battlefield.|$|E

5|$|In the break, {{a number}} of Central Europeans, {{including}} Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani, asked for top speed. This was protested by the Scandinavian and United States jumpers, and a 40-minute discussion broke out. At one point, one of the facilitators at the in-run received <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> confirming top speed. The facilitator was skeptical, and chose to call back to the judges, who could confirm {{that they had not}} given such a go-ahead. In the end, the judges chose to allow higher speeds, with a compromise of 5.0meters more distance. However, the facilitator only moved the rope 4.5meters. This made the Swiss furious, and they used their knives to cut the rope. They then accused the participants who were opposed to full speed of being cowards.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Julian {{had written}} to the Glidden Company, a {{supplier}} of soybean oil products, to request a five-gallon sample of the oil to use as his {{starting point for the}} synthesis of human steroidal sex hormones (in part because his wife was suffering from infertility). After receiving the request, W. J. O'Brien, a vice-president at Glidden, made <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> to Julian, offering him the position of director of research at Glidden's Soya Products Division in Chicago. He was very likely offered the job by O'Brien because he was fluent in German, and Glidden had just purchased a modern continuous countercurrent solvent extraction plant from Germany for the extraction of vegetable oil from soybeans for paints and other uses.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{is driven}} back to Area 51 {{along with two}} other Men in Black, Howard Grodin and Jeff Smoodge. After an angry {{telephone}} call from Fletcher's wife, Joanne, Mulder—still inside Fletcher's body—goes to Fletcher's home. Instead of sleeping in the bedroom, he decides to sleep downstairs in an easy chair and watch pornography. When he is awoken by Joanne, he mumbles Scully's name. While changing his clothes, Mulder receives <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> from Smoodge, who explains that the military has surveyed {{the wreckage of the}} craft from the night before, finding one of the human pilots merged into a rock but still alive. Another soldier, Captain Robert McDonough, had switched bodies with an elderly Hopi woman, as evident from McDonough's aberrant behavior.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, {{the case}} {{involved}} section 10(b), the right [...] "to retain and instruct counsel without delay {{and to be}} informed of that right." [...] The Court noted it had found in R. v. Bartle (1994) that rights to be informed that one may seek counsel included rights to be told of duty counsel and how to obtain it i.e., through <b>a</b> free <b>telephone</b> <b>call.</b> Although Latimer was told that legal aid existed, he was not told {{that he could make}} <b>a</b> free <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> and obtain advice from duty counsel right away. Latimer argued this contradicted Bartle. However, Saskatchewan happened to have different hours during which one could make <b>a</b> free <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> to directly obtain duty counsel. The arrest occurred {{at a time when it}} was not available; therefore the right established in Bartle was inapplicable in this case, as it would have been of no use.|$|R

5|$|On 27 August 1964, the British {{aircraft}} carrier HMS Victorious {{and her two}} destroyer escorts sailed through the Sunda Strait, an international waterway claimed by Indonesia, en route to Australia. Upset by the casual warning the British had given of the ships' impending passage through the Strait (<b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> made two days before), the lack of mention of the carrier in the warning, and wary {{of the possibility that}} the British were attempting to provoke them into a violent response, the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided two days later to attempt to bar the warships from making the return journey to Singapore, scheduled for the middle of September.|$|E
5|$|About 20minutes {{after the}} first step, Aldrin joined Armstrong {{on the surface and}} became the second human to set foot on the Moon, and the duo began their tasks of {{investigating}} how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface. Early on, they unveiled a plaque commemorating their flight, and also planted the flag of the United States. The flag used on this mission had a metal rod to hold it horizontal from its pole. Since the rod did not fully extend, and the flag was tightly folded and packed during the journey, the flag ended up with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze. Shortly after their flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> from his office. The President spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.|$|E
5|$|After {{a couple}} of months pondering his future career plans, he {{received}} <b>a</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> from the Stockport County chairman, Victor Bernard, who offered him the position of general manager. Stockport was a struggling lower league club with a small budget, and Trautmann's appointment was an attempt to improve its image. Many people in the local area supported one of the two Manchester clubs, so to stimulate interest Trautmann and Bernard decided to move matches to Friday evenings, when neither Manchester club would be playing. This improved revenue, but the team continued to struggle. Trautmann resigned in 1966 following a disagreement with Bernard. From 1967 to 1968, he was the manager of the German team Preußen Münster, taking them to a 13th-place finish in the Regionalliga West, following which he had a short spell at Opel Rüsselsheim.|$|E
