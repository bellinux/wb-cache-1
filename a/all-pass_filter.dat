25|$|The {{definition}} of phaser typically excludes such devices where the all-pass section is a delay line; such a device {{is called a}} flanger. Using a delay line creates an unlimited series of equally spaced notches and peaks. It is possible to cascade a delay line with another type of <b>all-pass</b> <b>filter.</b> This combines the unlimited number of notches from the flanger with the uneven spacing of the phaser.|$|E
25|$|The {{electronic}} phasing {{effect is}} created by splitting an audio signal into two paths. One path treats the signal with an <b>all-pass</b> <b>filter,</b> which preserves the amplitude of the original signal and alters the phase. The amount of change in phase depends on the frequency. When signals from the two paths are mixed, the frequencies {{that are out of}} phase will cancel each other out, creating the phaser's characteristic notches. Changing the mix ratio changes the depth of the notches; the deepest notches occur when the mix ratio is 50%.|$|E

2500|$|Many early {{dispersive}} filters {{were built}} using lumped element <b>all-pass</b> <b>filter</b> sections., but these proved hard to fabricate with any accuracy {{and it was}} difficult to achieve a satisfactory and repeatable performance. [...] Consequently, the time sidelobe levels of the compressed pulses were high with these early systems, even after spectral weighting, with results no better than those achieved by phase coding or chip coding at that time. [...] Typically, sidelobe levels were in the range -20 to -25dB [...] a poor result when compared to later achievements.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The frequency-response masking {{approach}} for highspeed recursive infinite-impulse response (IIR) digital filters is introduced. In this approach, the overall filter {{consists of a}} periodic model filter, its power-complementary periodic filter, and two masking filters. The model filters are composed of two <b>all-pass</b> <b>filters</b> in parallel, whereas the masking filters are linear-phase finite-impulse response (FIR) filters. The transfer functions of the <b>all-pass</b> <b>filters</b> are functions of which implies that the maximal sample frequency for the overall filter is {{times that of the}} corresponding conventional IIR filter. The maximal sample frequency can be increased to an arbitrary level for arbitrary bandwidths. The overall filter can be designed by separately optimizing the model and masking filters with the aid of conventional approximation techniques. The obtained overall filter also serves as a good initial filter for further optimization. Both nonlinear-phase and approximately linear-phase filters are considered. By using the new approach, the potential problems of pole–zero cancellations, which are inherent in algorithm transformation techniques, are avoided. Further, robust filters under finite-arithmetic conditions can always be obtained by using wave-digital <b>all-pass</b> <b>filters</b> and nonrecursive FIR filters. Several design examples are included illustrating the properties of the new filters. I...|$|R
40|$|It is {{accepted}} knowledge that inner functions and outer functions in complex analysis correspond, respectively, to <b>all-pass</b> <b>filters</b> and signals of minimum phase. The knowledge, however, {{has not been}} justified for general inner and outer functions. In digital signal processing the correspondence and related results are based on studies of rational functions. In this paper, based on the recent result on positivity of phase derivatives of inner functions, we establish the theoretical foundation for <b>all-pass</b> <b>filters</b> and signals of minimum phase. We, in particular, deal with infinite Blaschke products and general singular inner functions induced by singular measures. A number of results known for rational functions are generalized to general inner functions. Both the discrete and continuous signals cases are rigorously treated...|$|R

50|$|A similar <b>all-pass</b> <b>filter</b> can be {{implemented}} by interchanging {{the position of the}} resistor and capacitor, which turns the high-pass filter into a low-pass filter. The result is a phase shifter with the same quadrature frequency but a −180 degree shift at high frequencies and no shift at low frequencies. In other words, the transfer function is negated, and so it has the same pole at −1/RC and reflected zero at 1/RC. Again, the phase shift of the <b>all-pass</b> <b>filter</b> is double the phase shift of the first-order filter at its non-inverting input.|$|E

The VDF-based SRC provides variable fractional delay in the passband and additional attenuation in the stopband. The design of the VDF using weighted least squares (WLS) and semidefinite programming (SDP) approaches are described and compared. Design results show that both approaches give similar performances but the computational time is significantly lower for the WLS approach.
