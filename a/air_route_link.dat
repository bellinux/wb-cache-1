A hangar was brought from Squires Gate Airport in Blackpool. On St Mary's, until its own airport opened in 1939, the planes landed on the golf course. In 1938 Great Western and Southern Airlines took over Olley Air Service and Channel Air Ferries. It continued the service throughout World War II, during which it replaced the Dragons with de Havilland Dragon Rapides.|$|R

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>route</b> network optimization, {{one of the}} {{essential}} parts of the airspace planning, is {{an effective way to}} optimize airspace resources, increase airspace capacity, and alleviate air traffic congestion. However, little has been done on the optimization of <b>air</b> <b>route</b> network in the fragmented airspace caused by prohibited, restricted, and dangerous areas (PRDs). In this paper, an <b>air</b> <b>route</b> network optimization model is developed with the total operational cost as the objective function while airspace restriction, <b>air</b> <b>route</b> network capacity, and non-straight-line factors (NSLF) are taken as major constraints. A square grid cellular space, Moore neighbors, a fixed boundary, together with a set of rules for solving the route network optimization model are designed based on cellular automata. The empirical traffic of airports with the largest traffic volume in each of the 9 flight information regions in mainland China is collected as the origin-destination (OD) airport pair demands. Based on traffic patterns, the model generates 35 <b>air</b> <b>routes</b> which successfully avoids 144 PRDs. Compared with the current <b>air</b> <b>route</b> network structure, the number of nodes decreases by 41. 67 %, while the total length of flight segments and <b>air</b> <b>routes</b> drop by 32. 03 % and 5. 82 % respectively. The NSLF decreases by 5. 82 % with changes in the total length of the <b>air</b> <b>route</b> network. More importantly, the total operational cost of the whole network decreases by 6. 22 %. The computational results show the potential benefits of the model and the advantage of the algorithm. Optimization of <b>air</b> <b>route</b> network can significantly reduce operational cost while ensuring operation safety...|$|R
