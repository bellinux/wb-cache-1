5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E

5|$|Pest {{control of}} the jack jumper ant is {{successful}} in maintaining their populations around suburban habitats.

Pouring carbon disulfide into nest holes and covering entrances up with soil is another method of removing colonies.

An online survey was conducted among predominantly young adult Facebook users who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> romantic relationship (N= 272).
