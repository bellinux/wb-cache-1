The DAB Eureka 147 standard for digital radio is coordinated by the World DMB Forum. This standard of digital radio technology was defined in the late 1980s, and is now being introduced in some European countries. Commercial DAB receivers began to be sold in 1999 and, by 2006, 500 million people were in the coverage area of DAB broadcasts, although by this time sales had only taken off in the UK and Denmark.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} link between the design of {{international}} environmental agreements and the incentives for the private sector to invest in cleaner technologies. More specifically, it compares the performance, in the Paretoo sense, of two types of agreement : an <b>agreement</b> <b>on</b> a uniform <b>standard</b> with transfers and an <b>agreement</b> <b>on</b> differentiated <b>standards</b> without transfers. To achieve this goal, we use a multi-stage game where the private sector anticipates its irreversible investment given the expected level of abatement standards, resulting from future bilateral negotiations. Our findings indicate that whenever countries are able to partially commit, the <b>agreement</b> <b>on</b> a uniform <b>standard</b> may be preferable, as it creates greater incentives for firms to invest in costly abatement technology. This result relies on the low level of the set-up cost of this technology. If this level is sufficiently high, the announcement and implementation of the <b>agreement</b> <b>on</b> a uniform <b>standard</b> with transfers is not optimal, because it takes away the incentive of all firms to invest in a new abatement technology. agreements, standards, transfers, technology adoption, irreversible investment, bargaining, transboundary pollution. ...|$|R

Altmetrics are a useful supplement to traditional citation metrics, reflecting a variety of measurement points that give different perspectives on how a dataset is used and by whom. A positive development is the integration of a number of research datasets into the ISI Data Citation Index, making datasets searchable and linking them to published articles. Yet access to data resources and tracking the resulting altmetrics depend on specific qualities of the datasets and the systems where they are archived. Though research on altmetrics use is growing, the lack of standardization across datasets and system architecture undermines its generalizability. Without some standards, stakeholders' adoption of altmetrics will be limited...|$|E

Currently, in developed countries, it is, of course, almost impossible to bring new therapies or medical devices into clinical use without any regulatory approval. Regulatory bodies, though, are not always up to date about biomedical scientific understanding and possibilities of technology, and thus, there are examples of evolutionary trajectories where regulation co-evolves with the innovation process and the market (Metcalfe et al. 2005). Statutes concerning clinical medical research in general cover much of the stem cell-based research, {{and only a few}} countries have adopted legislation devoted to stem cell research per se.

In this paper, the STOF business model framework is employed to analyze m-payment services from the point of view of one of the key players in the ecosystem i. e., banks. We apply Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method to analyze the critical design issues for four domains of the STOF model. The results of the analysis show that service domain is the most important, followed by technology, organization and finance domains. Security related issues are found to be the most important by bank representatives.

The topic is not only interesting as a case study of "make or buy", but is especially timely in the specific field of telecommunications in Europe. In June 1987, the European Commission issued its Green Paper on telecommunications liberalisation and rationalisation of Europe's equipment manufacturers. Current difficulties include national regulatory powers, cross subsidies, lack of common standards, and lack of <b>agreement</b> <b>on</b> <b>standards,</b> frequencies and tariff principles. Not least, rapid changes in the technology itself has turned telecommunications into a Strategic competitive asset for companies. The two authors of these articles argue from slightly different perspectives; White as a major user developing into a provider, and Wilson as an adviser and provider.

40|$|Industry {{requirements}} for compact, high fiber count connectors in both telecom and datacom have created increased global demand for guide pin based multifiber connectors such as MT(MPO/MPX) and MiniMT(MT-RJ) connectors. To realize the cost/performance benefits of {{these type of}} connectors, the manufacturing processes must be precisely controlled to maintain the extremely critical tolerances of angle, alignment and height of the multiple fibers. A major part of gaining control {{of this process is}} the measurement of the endface geometry. Feedback on physical parameters such as flatness, radius of curvature, surface angle, and the protrusion of the fibers allows fine tuning of the polishing process. This hard data provides the manufacturer with a basis for quality control and crucial information for quality assurance to guarantee long term performance in the field. The Telephone Industry Association (TIA) and the International Electrotechnical Committee (IEC) are working in parallel on writing Fiber Optic Test Procedures (FOTP’s) for measuring multifiber end face geometries. This paper will discuss the latest ideas on procedures which are being recommended and the standards being proposed in the industry for defining and measuring these connectors. <b>Agreement</b> <b>on</b> <b>standards</b> will allow the industry to advance its technology by improving quality, consistency, and intermateability of these intricate products...|$|E
40|$|Background: High density {{lipoprotein}} (HDL) cholesterol level {{varies with}} ethnicity and gender. In Korea {{there has not}} been an <b>agreement</b> <b>on</b> <b>standards</b> for HDL cholesterol level. Therefore, in order to establish a foundation for research on HDL cholesterol, we investigated the gender difference in HDL cholesterol level after adjusting associated factors. Methods: The study population included 4, 465 individuals (1, 833 men, 2, 632 women) representing 33, 502, 918 Koreans 20 years of age or older, who participated in the 2005 Korean National Health and Nutrition Survey. After stratifying by gender, we analyzed the HDL cholesterol level according to the general characteristics of the study population. Then we identified independent factors associated with HDL cholesterol level. After adjusting for covariates, we estimated the gender difference in HDL cholesterol level. Results: We demonstrated that age, current smoking, body mass index, alcohol intake, triglyceride and low density lipoprotein cholesterol level have significant impact on HDL cholesterol level. In addition, educational status was also an important factor for men, while fat intake was a significant factor for women. After adjusting associated factors, the means (standard errors) of HDL cholesterol level were 43. 8 (0. 2) mg/dL in men and 46. 3 (0. 2) mg/dL in women, respectively. Conclusion: The mean gender difference in HDL level (2. 5 mg/dL) in Korean adults was, therefore, less than those observe...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the historical role of ombudsmen in {{institutions of higher}} education in the United States (U. S.) and explores whether the rise of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) has significantly affected the role they play in managing conflict and disputes. It is proposed that the experiences of ombudsmen over time and the impact of ADR have pushed ombudsmen from a classical model to a systems model. The classical model emerged with the first university ombudsmen offices in the 1960 s, based upon the early Swedish parliamentary ombudsman. The systems model focuses on systematic approaches to conflict management and dispute resolution in the workplace and features the ombudsman playing {{an active role in the}} design and implementation of a system. There is a dearth of quantitative or qualitative data on ombudsmen in higher education. The need to collect data and the belief that ombudsmen in higher education are in a unique position to contribute to the future of conflict management and dispute resolution design provided motivation for this study. The approach used was to identify all ombudsmen in higher education in the U. S. and to develop and administer a survey to examine the creation of these offices and their subsequent development. The survey consisted of three parts focusing on (1) the collection of current demographic information on higher education ombudsmen offices; (2) attitudinal queries regarding the ombudsmen, focusing on their principles and beliefs; and (3) collection of demographic information on the ombudsman professional. The survey found widespread <b>agreement</b> <b>on</b> <b>standards</b> of practice – independence, neutrality, impartiality, confidentiality, and informality – with many voluntarily following the standards of practice established by professiona...|$|E
40|$|The Lisbon Treaty extends {{exclusive}} European Union {{competence to}} {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI). After a transition period this should enable the EU to conclude either international investment agreements or comprehensive trade and investment agreements with third parties. This extension of the EU’s competence offers the opportunity of promoting EU competitiveness in global markets through increased investment and better access to key third country markets. It also facilitates a greater European influence over international investment agreements a key instrument in any response to globalisation. The EU will {{need to develop a}} coherent and balanced approach to investment if it is {{to make the most of}} these opportunities. In this the EU needs to address four major issues. First, the treaty provides no definition of FDI and thus the scope of EU exclusive competence. The EU institutions must therefore work towards a consensus on the scope of competence or how to manage mixed competence negotiations. Second, there is a need to define the main elements of an EU investment policy. This will involve <b>agreement</b> <b>on</b> <b>standards</b> for investment protection, dispute settlement and arbitral procedures as well as what the EU aims should be in terms of promoting ‘sustainable investment. ’ Third, it will be necessary to decide on the basis of clear and objective criteria, which third countries should be given priority when it comes to negotiating EU level investment agreements. Finally, agreement must be found on how to manage the transition from member state bilateral investment treaties (BITs) to EU level investment agreements.

40|$|We {{aimed to}} assess the current {{organisation}} and clinical practice of teams treating children with intestinal failure (IF) across Europe and compare the results with the current guideline. A two-part online survey was sent to all the major European specialist IF services. The first part concerned general information about the team and patients monitored. The second part concerned important care topics such as vascular access and monitoring of complications. No patient identifiers were collected. Seventy-three respondents completed the first part, representing 61 teams in 20 countries. The median number of children on parenteral nutrition (PN) at home per team was 15 (range 1 - 125). Teams consisted of the following members: paediatric gastroenterologist (present in 100 % of the teams), dietitian (95 %), specialist nurse (92 %), paediatric surgeon (89 %), pharmacist (82 %), psychologist (66 %), social worker (62 %), speech therapist (48 %), physiotherapist (38 %), general paediatrician (33 %). The second part was completed by 67 / 73 respondents (59 / 61 teams). Vascular access care was comparable with the guideline. Somatostatin analogues were prescribed by 14 % of the IF teams and probiotics by 44 % of the teams. Prophylactic anticoagulation was used by 46 % of the teams. In 81 % of the teams a multicomponent lipid emulsion containing fish oil was routinely used. Bone densitometry was regularly performed in 75 % of teams, but never performed in 19 %. In conclusion, {{there is a wide}} diversity of composition of IF teams and their number of patients treated. Overall, there is good compliance to the current guideline.
