It is also partly based on the speed of action of any such solution deployed, in contrast to carbon sequestration projects such as carbon dioxide air capture which would take longer to work. However, gaps in understanding of these processes exist, for example the effect on stratospheric climate and on rainfall patterns, and further research is needed.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} ways in which drought, {{basically}} a sustained precipitation deficit, can be initiated and prolonged. Some processes that reduce precipitation include, large scale circulation anomalies, lack of moisture advected into a region, reduction of local moisture supplies, production of virga as opposed to precipitation, and possibly even the role of aerosols in the dusty environment acting to reduce precipitation. Over the five years of this drought, these processes and numerous other factors were operating at various times and locations to preclude substantial precipitation from being produced over large regions of the Prairies. While prairie drought processes have characteristic spatial and temporal scales, land surface hydrological/biophysical processes generally operate at small spatial scales (and with larger inherent spatial variability) while <b>atmospheric</b> <b>process</b> have a hierarchy of scales ranging from planetary to local turbulence. DRI is addressing the cascade of energy and movement of moisture through atmospheric processes and the horizontal scale link between land surface and groundwater processes during drought events.|$|E

40|$|Weather {{monitoring}} {{model is}} closely related to the problem of objective analysis of the field of meteorology. The amount of meteorological data is quite substantial and hence the processing of these data is one of primary problems is dynamic meteorology. Therefore, a weather system model must consider <b>atmospheric</b> <b>process,</b> which can be built by mechanistic model rather than statistical approach. Integration of numerical model and spatial model will produce spatial weather information. It should be managed in one computerized system called as an information system for weather monitoring. The approach of the research was divided into five tasks. First task was satellite data capturing and extracting, second was development of numerical modeling based on dynamic and thermodynamic of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>process,</b> third was integration of numerical modeling and geographic information system in the spatial model, fourth was to develop graphical user interface and the fifth task was application of system in the real-world. Temporal resolution of this model is one day, however, in reality weather is temporal state of atmosphere condition that change any time. Moreover, this model only describes weather condition when data satellite on the day could be captured. Therefore, to increase the temporal resolution of this model, the input data could be added or integrated with other satellite data such as GMS satellite that has one-hour temporal resolution. Spatial resolution in this model is 50 x 50 kilometers square for global and 8 x 8 kilometers for regional area. Actually, for the spatial resolution, this model has been prepared as NOAA’s spatial resolution. This model cannot simulate vertical distribution of atmosphere, so, it does not give information about relative humidity and precipitation.

An agricultural area in the Snake River Basin in Idaho and its surrounding natural vegetation regions are the study area. Two model improvements are tested in this investigation: modification to the calculations of the surface exchange coefficient and the addition of an irrigation scheme to increase available water to crop areas.

The depth of the mid-level dry layer and associated ice crystal sublimation, and subsequent disruption of ice nucleation and diffusional ice Clystal growth in the lower tropospheric moist layer, is studied. The lack of lower tropospheric warm layers (above freezing) suggest that ice crystal sublimation in the mid-level dry layer was the primary <b>atmospheric</b> <b>process</b> responsible for freezing, rather than frozen, precipitation.

40|$|In {{the paper}} an attempt {{is made to}} express the isotope {{concentration}} in precipitation {{as a function of}} the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>process</b> which transport water vapor. It is found that the fractionation which takes place is considerably less when the atmospheric transport is due to eddy motion than when transport is simply advective. In the latter case fractionation follows the Rayleigh condensation formula. In the case of eddy transport fractionation may under special circumstances follow the same formula although with a factor (I/ &- 1) instead of (a- 1). More complicated transport patterns in the atmosphere are rather difficult to express mathematically. As to the vertically integrated transport it is at present difficult to derive explicit relations over ocean areas because of the exchange which takes place between air and water. Over continents, however, the relation can be formulated more explicit under certain conditions.
