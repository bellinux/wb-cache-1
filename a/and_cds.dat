40|$|Fibrocytes {{appear to}} {{participate}} in inflammation and tissue remodeling in patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO). These patients have increased frequencies of circulating TSH receptor (TSHR) - <b>and</b> <b>CD</b> 40 -positive fibrocytes, suggesting TSHR <b>and</b> <b>CD</b> 40 may play roles in proinflammatory cytokine production, which ultimately leads to orbital inflammation and tissue remodeling. To investigate the potential interactions between the TSHR <b>and</b> <b>CD</b> 40 signaling pathways and their roles in IL- 6 <b>and</b> TNF-α production. <b>CD</b> 40 expression on fibrocytes was assessed using flow cytometry; IL- 6 and TNF-α protein release using Luminex technology; increased IL- 6 and TNF-α mRNA abundance, using real-time PCR; TSH- <b>and</b> <b>CD</b> 40 ligand (CD 40 L) -stimulated Akt phosphorylation in fibrocytes, by western blot analysis; TSHR-CD 40 protein-protein interaction, using co-immunoprecipitation, <b>and</b> <b>CD</b> 40 -TSHR co-localization, using immunocytochemistry. TSH enhances CD 40 expression at a pre-translational level in fibrocytes. Production of IL- 6 and TNF-α after costimulation with TSH <b>and</b> <b>CD</b> 40 L was greater than that after TSH or CD 40 L stimulation alone.

Both <b>CD</b> 4 cells <b>and</b> <b>CD</b> 8 cells contribute to SLP in HTLV-I infection, whereas SLP in HTLV-II infection is usually restricted to CD 8 cells.

Purified <b>CD</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>CD</b> 8 cells were separated into <b>CD</b> 45 RO+ <b>and</b> <b>CD</b> 45 RO- populations by a modified panning technique, and spontaneous proliferation (SP) of the cell subsets was assessed. For all five HTLV-I-infected persons whose mononuclear cell cultures were SLP+, only CD 45 RO+ cells, but not CD 45 RO- cells, within <b>CD</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>CD</b> 8 subsets showed SP. In contrast, five of six SLP+ HTLV-II+ individuals showed SP in both the <b>CD</b> 45 RO+ <b>and</b> the <b>CD</b> 45 RO- subsets of <b>CD</b> 4 cells, <b>and</b> 10 of 12 SLP+ HTLV-II+ individuals showed SP of both the <b>CD</b> 45 RO+ <b>and</b> <b>CD</b> 45 RO- subsets of CD 8 cells.

Methods: <b>CD</b> 80 <b>and</b> <b>CD</b> 86 were stimulated using anti-CD 80 and anti-CD 86 monoclonal antibodies. To assess apoptosis and surface protein expression, flow cytometric analysis was performed. Intracellular signal molecules were evaluated by RT-PCR and immunoblot. Morphology and localization of proteins were examined using inverted or confocal microscope. Results: Cross-linking of <b>CD</b> 80 <b>and</b> <b>CD</b> 86 induced apoptosis and interfered with proliferation of EBV-transformed B cells, and dispersion of clumped cells. We also examined that their stimulation induced ROS accumulation <b>and</b> reduced <b>CD</b> 54 expression.
