40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a simple method for selective and sensitive detection of black powder by adding chlorinated hydrocarbons in the drift gas instead {{of changing the}} structure of conventional ion mobility spectrometer (IMS). The function of chloride modifiers was to substitute Cl-(H 2 O) (n) for O- 2 - (H 2 O) (n) in the drift region {{so as to avoid}} the overlap between O- 2 (-) (H 2 O) (n) and sulfur ion peaks. Among CH 2 Cl 2, CHCl 3 and CCl 4, CCl 4 was chosen as the modifier due to the best peak-to-peak resolution and stability towards the fluctuation of modifier concentration. With 1. 4 ppm CCl 4 as the modifier, the minimum detectable quantity of 0. 1 ng for sulfur was achieved. Moreover, this method showed the ability for detection of common explosives at sub-nanogram level, such as black powder (BP), <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> (ANFO), 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT), and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). In summary, this method requiring no configuration modification has high sensitivity and selectivity, and consumes trace amount of modifier. And these characteristics make it easy to be adopted in current deployed IMS to detect black powder explosives. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Ion {{mobility}} spectrometry (IMS) {{has become}} the most deployed technique for on-site detection of trace explosives, and the reactant ions generated in the ionization source are tightly related to the performances of IMS. Combination of multiform reactant ions would provide more information and is in favor of correct identification of explosives. Fast switchable CO 3 -(H 2 O) (n) and O- 2 (-) (H 2 O) (n) reactant ions were realized in a dopant-assisted negative photoionization ion mobility spectrometer (DANP-IMS). The switching could be achieved in less than 2 s by simply changing the gas flow direction. Up to 88 % of the total reactant ions were CO 3 -(H 2 O) (n) in the bidirectional mode, and 89 % of that were O- 2 (-) (H 2 O) (n) in the unidirectional mode. The characteristics of combination of CO 3 -(H 2 O) (n) and O- 2 (-) (H 2 O) (n) were demonstrated by the detection of explosives, including 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT), cyclo- 1, 3, 5 -trimethylene- 2, 4, 6 -trinitramine (RDX), <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> (ANFO), and black powder (BP).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with scrutinising the source, distribution and detectability of seismic velocity phenomena {{that may be used}} as proxies to study conditions in the crust. Specifically, we develop modelling techniques in order to analyse the directional variation of seismic wave speed in the crust and test them at Mt. Asama in Japan and Canterbury, New Zealand. We also implement both active source and noise interferometry to identify velocity variations at Mt. Ruapehu, New Zealand. Observations of temporal variation of anisotropic seismic velocity parameters at Asama volcano in Japan indicate that there is some process (or processes) affecting anisotropy, attributed to closure of microcracks in the rock as it is subjected to volcanic stress in the crust. To test this assertion, a 3 D numerical model is created incorporating volcanic stress, ray tracing and estimation of the anisotropy to produce synthetic shear wave splitting results using a dyke stress model. Anisotropy is calculated in two ways; by considering a basic scenario where crack density is uniform and a case where the strength of anisotropy is related to dry crack closure from deviatoric stress. We find that the approach is sensitive to crack density, crack compliance, and the regional stress field. In the case of dry crack closure, modelled stress conditions produce a much smaller degree of anisotropy than indicated by measurements. We propose that the source of anisotropy changes at Asama is tied to more complex processes that may precipitate from stress changes or other volcanic processes, such as the movement of pore fluid. We develop a generalised anisotropy inversion model based on the linearised, iterative least-squares inversion technique of Abt and Fischer [2008]. The model is streamlined for use with results from the MFAST automatic shear wave splitting software [Savage et al., 2010]. The method iteratively solves for the best fitting magnitude and orientation of anisotropy in each element of the model space using numerically calculated partial derivatives. The inversion is applied to the Canterbury plains in the region surrounding the Greendale fault, using shear-wave splitting data from the 2010 Darfield earthquake sequence. Crustal anisotropy is resolved down to a depth of 20 km at a spatial resolution of 5 km, with good resolution near the Greendale fault. We identify a lateral variation in anisotropy strength across the Greendale fault, possibly associated with post-seismic stress changes. We perform active source and noise interferometry at Ruapehu in order to investigate potential seismic velocity changes and assess their use as a possible eruption forecasting method. Six co-located 100 kg <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> explosives were set off serially at Lake Moawhango, situated approximately 20 km south-east of Mount Ruapehu. Two methods of interferometry, using moving window cross correlation in the time and frequency domains, respectively, were applied to the recorded signal from each explosion pair in order to determine velocity changes from the signal coda waves. We identify possible diurnal velocity variations of ~ 0 : 7 % associated with strain caused by the solid Earth tide. Synthetic testing of velocity variation recoverability was also performed using both methods. Interferometry of noise cross-correlations during the period was also performed using moving window cross correlation in the frequency domain. Analysis of velocity variations in the ZZ, RR and TT component pairs show little coherency. This, combined with results from synthetic testing that show that the frequency domain interferometry technique employed is unstable above velocity variations of 0. 1 %, indicate that the method may not be suitable for determining velocity variations at Ruapehu...|$|E
40|$|Reaction rates {{depend on}} {{temperature}} {{as well as}} on the mechanical state. In shock wave initiation, experimental data almost always comprise mechanical measurements such as shock speed, material speed, compression, and pressure, and are accordingly modeled in terms of these parameters. Omission of temperature is one reason why mechanically based reaction rates do not extrapolate well out with the range of states used to normalize them. The model presented addresses chemical processes directly, enabling chemical kinetic data reported in terms of temperature (and at STP, generally) to be used in shock reaction models. We have recently extended a temperature-based model for use with ANFO-type formulations. Reactive material is treated as a heterogeneous mixture of components, each of which has its own model for response to dynamic loading (equation of state, strength model, reactions.) A finite-rate equilibration model is used to determine the overall response of the mixture to dynamic loading. In this model of ANFO, the <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> and the <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> are treated as separate components in the unreacted mixture...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{has been}} carried out at BAE Systems Hägglunds, a company in Örnsköldsvik which {{develops}} and produces military vehicles. The main focus in this thesis is numerical studies of non-ideal detonations such as those which arise when using ANFO as the main explosive in a charge. ANFO is a mix of <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> and <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> and often used as an improvised explosive device in terrorism activities. A non-ideal detonation means that the reaction zone is much longer than for an ideal detonation and may not be assumed to have an abrupt discontinuity. In other studies this phenomenon has shown to cause special properties, for instance a detonation velocity that depends heavily on charge radius and external confinement. In this study the purpose and aim is to show this behaviour in simulations with the finite element code LS-DYNA. The simulations were performed with cylindrical charges modelled in 2 D in axi-symmetry. The explosive was modelled either by the Jones-Wilkins-Lee equation of state or by the more advanced ignition and growth reactive flow model. A comparison between the two is made and the result shows that the ignition and growth in a good way confirm the behaviour of a non-ideal detonation. The conclusions are that the ignition and growth reactive flow model seems to be an adequate method to simulate non-ideal explosives. More material parameters for ANFO would thou be needed, now it was rather limited and own assumptions had to be made in order to use the Ignition and growth model. In the future a combination of the ignition and growth model and a more advanced equation of state, such as Williamsburg, might be an even better way to describe a non-ideal detonation. The most important thou would be more experimental data to validate the simulations with ignition and growth against. Validerat; 20110526 (anonymous...|$|R
40|$|Small scale {{experiments}} for non-ideal {{and homemade}} explosives (HMEs) were investigated, analyzed, and subsequently modeled {{in an attempt}} to develop more predictive capabilities for the threat assessment of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), as well as to provide new analysis capabilities for other investigators in the field. Non-ideal explosives and HMEs are challenging to characterize because of the nearly limitless parameter space (e. g. sample composition, density, particle morphology, etc.) which gives rise to a broad range of explosive sensitivity and performance. Large scale tests, such as rate stick and gap tests, are not feasible for characterizing every HME of interest due to limitations in time and cost. These small scale experiments utilize a 35 GHz microwave interferometer to measure the instantaneous shock and failing detonation wave velocities in explosives. Only those explosives which are transparent to the microwave radiation are evaluated, including <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> plus <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> (ANFO). It is shown {{here for the first time}} that the small scale measurements may be related to large scale sensitivity and performance for a large enough sample size and level of confinement. ^ Specifically, four different experimental configurations were explored that require only 1 - 5 g of material. By varying the charge diameter, as well as the thickness and sound speed of the confining material, the failure rate and shock front curvature of an overdriven failing detonation may be tailored. The detailed experimental data is also highly repeatable, provided that the initial sample density is uniform and consistent from test to test. Results from the MI data also reveal the existence of an inflexion point in velocity, which is thought to be related to the measurements obtained from larger rate sticks. ^ The different MI experiments were subsequently modeled in 2 d as well as 3 d using the shock physics hydrocode CTH. An ignition and growth reactive burn (IGRB) model was developed for non-ideal explosives, and shown to be relevant to capturing the behavior of some of the overdriven failing detonation waves. Many simplifying assumptions were made, so that the MI data might possibly be used for model calibration and validation. It was determined that an intermediate level of confinement utilizing low sound speed polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is most relevant for fitting the IGRB model constants, which were then used to predict the other MI experiments with partial success. ^ Overall, the CTH simulations provide much more information than what is available from the MI measurements alone. These simulations were used to investigate pressure waves in the explosive and confiner materials, and to show that the reactive waves are likely transitioning from supersonic to subsonic deflagration, where thermal effects, compaction behavior, and material strength are important. Consequently, these simulations are not able to match the weaker confinement and smaller diameter experiments over the full duration of the tests. The calibrated IGRB model was then used to make several predictions for shock sensitivity, changes to the initial density, and other large scale tests. Future work is suggested to validate these predictions and to improve the model development. Overall, the high level of integration between experimental and modeling efforts shown in this work is critical to better understand HMEs and to design new small scale experiments. ...|$|R
