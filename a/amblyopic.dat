Most of the patients who underwent this treatment gained improved visual acuity of the weaker eye, and some also showed increased stereoacuity. Another study performed at the same institute showed that dichoptic training can be more effective in adults than the more conventional amblyopia treatment of an eye patch. For this investigation, 18 adults played the game Tetris for one hour each day, half of the group wearing eye patches and the other half playing a dichoptic version of the game. After two weeks, the group who played dichoptically showed a significant improvement of vision in the weaker eye and in stereopsis acuity; the eye patch group had moderate improvements, which increased substantially after they, too, were given the dichoptic training afterwards. Dichoptic-based perceptual learning therapy, presented by means of a head-mounted display, is amenable also to <b>amblyopic</b> children, as it improves both the <b>amblyopic</b> eye's visual acuity and the stereo function. The researchers at McGill University have shown that one to three weeks of playing a dichoptic video game for one to two hours on a hand-held device [...] "can improve acuity and restore binocular function, including stereopsis in adults".

50|$|Recent {{research}} has identified the homeoprotein Otx2 {{as a possible}} molecular ‘messenger’ that is necessary for experience-driven visual plasticity during the critical period. Initially involved in embryonic head formation, Otx2 is re-expressed during the critical period of rats (>P23) and regulates the maturation of parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic interneurons (PV-cells), which control the onset of critical period plasticity. Dark-rearing from birth and binocular enucleation of rats resulted in decreased expression of PV-cells and Otx2, which suggests that these proteins are visually experience-driven. Otx2 loss-of-function experiments delayed ocular dominance plasticity by impairing the development of PV-cells. Research into Otx2 and visual plasticity during the critical period {{is of particular interest}} to the study of developmental abnormalities such as amblyopia.

50|$|The cover-uncover {{test can}} also be used for more {{problematic}} disorders of binocular vision, the tropias.

If it moved from in to out, the person has esotropia. People with exotropia or esotropia are wall-eyed or cross-eyed respectively. These are forms of strabismus that can be accompanied by amblyopia. There are numerous definitions of amblyopia.

40|$|SummaryAdults with amblyopia, {{a common}} visual cortex {{disorder}} caused primarily by binocular disruption during an early critical period, {{do not respond}} to conventional therapy involving occlusion of one eye [1]. But {{it is now clear that}} the adult human visual cortex has a significant degree of plasticity [2], suggesting that something must be actively preventing the adult brain from learning to see through the <b>amblyopic</b> eye. One possibility is an inhibitory signal from the contralateral eye that suppresses cortical inputs from the <b>amblyopic</b> eye [3, 4]. Such a gating mechanism could explain the apparent lack of plasticity within the adult <b>amblyopic</b> visual cortex [5, 6]. Here we provide direct evidence that alleviating suppression of the <b>amblyopic</b> eye through dichoptic stimulus presentation induces greater levels of plasticity than forced use of the <b>amblyopic</b> eye alone.

Ten <b>amblyopic</b> patients had to indicate whether the lower segment of the moving target was offset {{to the left or}} right relative to the upper segment. For five patients we also measured thresholds for a conventional moving vernier. Five normal subjects were measured with sharply focused and blurred interpolative verniers. At low velocities of interpolative vernier targets, results of <b>amblyopic</b> eyes are inferior to those of <b>amblyopic</b> eyes, indicating a similarity between (optical) blur using their <b>amblyopic</b> than using their normal eye at high velocities.

With some exceptions in some observers, the four main results were as follows. (1) For the monocular and dichoptic conditions, sensitivity was less in the <b>amblyopic</b> eye than in the good eye at all mask contrasts. (2) Binocular and monocular dipper functions superimposed in the good eye. (3) Monocular masking functions had a normal dipper shape in the good eye, but facilitation was diminished in the <b>amblyopic</b> eye. (4) A less consistent result was normal facilitation in dichoptic masking when testing the good eye, but a loss of this when testing the <b>amblyopic</b> eye.
