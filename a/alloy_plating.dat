40|$|We {{report the}} {{fabrication}} of photofunctional Co-Cr <b>alloy</b> <b>plate</b> that is prepared {{by a simple}} modification process for photodynamic application. Photoinduced functionality {{is provided by the}} photosensitizer of hematoporphyrin (Hp) that initially generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anion radical and singlet oxygen. The photosensitizer with carboxyl group was chemically bonded {{to the surface of the}} Co-Cr <b>alloy</b> <b>plate</b> by esterification reaction. Microstructure and elemental composition of the Co-Cr <b>alloy</b> <b>plate</b> were checked with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). Fabrication of the photofunctionality of the Co-Cr <b>alloy</b> <b>plate</b> was confirmed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), reflectance UV-Vis absorption, and emission spectroscopy. Reactive oxygen generation from the photofunctional Co-Cr <b>alloy</b> <b>plate</b> was confirmed by using the decomposition reaction of 1, 3 -diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF). The results suggest that the immobilized photosensitizer molecules on the surface of Co-Cr <b>alloy</b> <b>plate</b> still possess their optical and functional properties including reactive oxygen generation.

The aluminum <b>alloy</b> <b>plate</b> girders were fabricated by welding three plates to form an I-section. A total of 118 numerical data are presented. A non-linear finite element model is developed and verified against experimental results. Geometric and material non-linearities {{were included in the}} finite element model. The welding of the aluminum <b>alloy</b> <b>plate</b> girders and the influence of the heat affected zone (HAZ) are also considered and carefully modeled. A sensitivity analysis on geometric imperfections of the aluminum <b>alloy</b> <b>plate</b> girders was performed. It was shown that the finite element model closely predicted the ultimate loads, web deformations and failure modes of aluminum <b>alloy</b> <b>plate</b> girders. Hence, the model was used for an extensive parametric study of cross-section geometries, and the web slenderness value ranged from 49 to 393. The test results and the shear resistances predicted by the finite element analysis were compared with the design strengths obtained using the European Code and American Specification for aluminum structures. Based on the experimental and numerical results, a design method for shear resistance of aluminum <b>alloy</b> <b>plate</b> girders is proposed in this study. The proposed design method is modified from the design rules in the EC 9 Code.

These coatings are characterized for their structure, morphology and chemical composition by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). <b>Alloy</b> coatings <b>plated</b> at pH 8 are crystalline, whereas coatings electrodeposited at pH 5 are nanocrystalline in nature. XPS studies have demonstrated that as-deposited <b>alloy</b> <b>plated</b> at pH 8 with DC contain only Co 2 + and W 6 + species, whereas that <b>alloy</b> <b>plated</b> at pH 5 has significant amount of Co- 0 and W- 0 along with Co 2 + and W 6 + species.

50|$|Michael Wilkinson desiged {{the costumes}} for Batman in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). Director Zack Snyder tweeted {{a photo of}} the first Batsuit for the film on May 13, 2014. It is {{influenced}} by the Batsuit seen in The Dark Knight Returns, and is noted by Bruce and Alfred to include additional armor to compensate for Bruce's greater age, as well as a device in the cowl to alter Bruce's voice when in the suit. The Batsuit is made of a Kevlar-titanium weave, is highly durable, making it resistant to knives and low-caliber firearms, the cowl and neck area of the suit consists of fabric-coated titanium <b>alloy</b> <b>plating,</b> protecting his neck and head from blade injuries and small caliber firearms (a man using a knife could only cause sparks to fly when trying to stab Batman {{in the back of the}} neck). Not even bullets can pierce the suit at point-blank range, but some areas are somewhat vulnerable as a thug is successfully able to stab Batman with a knife in the upper arm. A second Batsuit was unveiled at ComicCon 2014, and unlike the first which is made of cloth, it is armored and features illuminated white eyes. In the film, Batman's armor is a powered exoskeleton built by him and Alfred Pennyworth to counter Superman's strength as well as to protect Batman from Superman's attacks. It is also armed with a riot gun to fire kryptonite gas grenades and a kryptonite spear, both of which are necessary to weaken Superman to the point where Batman can fight him directly. The armor is damaged in the fight with Superman, prompting Batman to return to his usual costume when he departs to save Martha Kent from her abductors.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} involves {{modification of}} Zn pure and Zn <b>alloy</b> <b>plates</b> to be utilized for dye removal. The modification is aimed to produce ZnO layer {{on the surface}} of Zn pure and Zn <b>alloy</b> <b>plates.</b> Sand blasting technique is used to remove a naturally formed oxide layer on Zn pure and Zn <b>alloy</b> <b>plates.</b> The sand blasting technique is also intended to produce a curved groove site to strengthen the ZnO layer formed {{on the surface of}} modified Zn pure and Zn <b>alloy</b> <b>plates.</b> The modification of Zn pure and Zn <b>alloy</b> <b>plates</b> consist of three different methods, electrolysis, immersing in H 2 O 2 and heating. Based on the analysis of DR UV-Vis, SEM and XRD, all three modification methods successfully produced ZnO layer on Zn pure and Zn <b>alloy</b> <b>plates.</b> The formation of ZnO layer is different in thickness and electrolysis is chosen as the best technique for the ZnO layer production. Methylene blue dye (20 ppm, pH 6. 56) is utilized as a sample solution to study the removal activity of modified Zn pure and Zn <b>alloy</b> <b>plates.</b> Results obtained from UV-Vis spectra shows that the percentage of methylene blue removal by modified Zn pure plate and was 81. 9 % and 70. 0 % respectively Zn <b>alloy</b> <b>plate.</b> Results also showed that adsorption and photocatalysis are involved in the removal of methylene blue dye. Adsorption becomes a major contributor for the removal of methylene blue dye where it contributes 50 % of methylene blue removal and photocatalysis only contributes 30 % of methylene blue removal. It was also observed that desorption of the methylene blue will occur if the plates are placed in beaker containing distilled water. Modified Zn pure and Zn <b>alloy</b> <b>plates</b> have a “weak adsorption” and “strong desorption” characteristics. The “weak adsorption” and “strong desorption” behaviours of the modified Zn pure and Zn alloy was utilized to create an integrated chemical for application in wastewater treatment in textile industry. This system combines adsorption and photocatalysis techniques for the removal of dye molecules in textile wastewater. The main benefit of this system is that it can separate the dye molecules from wastewater by weak adsorption and transferred dye molecule into a special tank by “strong desorption”.

The effect of pre-existing twins on the mechanical properties of AZ 31 <b>alloy</b> <b>plates</b> at lower elevated temperature was investigated in the current paper. The results revealed that the twinned AZ 31 <b>alloy</b> <b>plates</b> exhibited higher strength at lower elevated temperature than the as-received plates without a large reduction in elongation, especially the yield strength increased by 36, 30 and 21 MPa at {{room temperature}}, 100 °C and 200 °C, respectively. The improved strength is attributed to the grain refinement by pre-existing { 10 – 12 } twin boundaries. Compared with the as-received AZ 31 <b>alloy</b> <b>plates,</b> the twinned plates exhibited more pronounced flow softening at 200 °C, which can be interpreted by the dynamic recrystallization softening effect induced by pre-existing twins.

The field of zinc <b>alloy</b> <b>plating</b> has undergone enormous development in comparison to any other plating during the last few decades. It is also the fact that in total literage and number of installations, zinc is the leading metal deposited in the electroplating world.
