5|$|Soon thereafter, Ophelia {{rushes to}} her father, {{telling him that}} Hamlet arrived at her door the prior night half-undressed and {{behaving}} crazily. Polonius blames love for Hamlet's madness and resolves to inform Claudius and Gertrude. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>enters</b> to do so, {{the king and queen}} finish welcoming Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two student acquaintances of Hamlet, to Elsinore. The royal couple has requested that the students investigate the cause of Hamlet's mood and behavior. Additional news requires that Polonius wait to be heard: messengers from Norway inform Claudius that the King of Norway has rebuked Prince Fortinbras for attempting to re-fight his father's battles. The forces that Fortinbras had conscripted to march against Denmark will instead be sent against Poland, though they will pass through a portion of Denmark to get there.|$|E
5|$|Vincent begins {{creating}} {{the painting of}} the church and soon spots the beast inside. The Doctor demands that Amy stay back <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>enters</b> the church alone, but she and Vincent both agree they should help the Doctor. Vincent is able to save the Doctor and Amy, describing the beast's actions as they hide in the confessionals. The Doctor soon realises from Vincent's description that the beast is blind, the likely reason it was abandoned on Earth, and is frightened of its surroundings. The beast is impaled on Vincent's easel when it tries to lunge at the artist. The Doctor attempts to soothe the dying creature while Vincent empathises with its pain. After the creature dies, the three return outside the church and Vincent describes the night sky as he envisions it.|$|E

25|$|James Joyce’s novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is {{partially}} set in UCD (when it was sited on Earlsfort Terrace) where Stephen Dedalus (now {{the name of}} the IT building) is enrolled as a student. Joyce's posthumously-published autobiographical novel Stephen Hero contains stories of his time in UCD. Flann O'Brien’s novel At Swim-Two-Birds features a UCD student who writes a meta-novel wherein the author is put on trial by the characters of his novel. Maeve Binchy's novel, Circle of Friends, deals with three female friends starting college in UCD in the 1950s. However, shots of Trinity College were used in the 1995 film. The second Ross O'Carroll-Kelly novel, The Teenage Dirtbag Years, follows Ross <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>enters</b> UCD.|$|E
25|$|During {{the filming}} of The Bread and Alley in 1970, Kiarostami had major {{differences}} with his experienced cinematographer about how to film {{the boy and the}} attacking dog. While the cinematographer wanted separate shots of the boy approaching, a close-up of his hand <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>enters</b> the house and closes the door, followed by a shot of the dog, Kiarostami believed that if the three scenes could be captured as a whole it would have a more profound impact in creating tension over the situation. That one shot took around forty days to complete, until Kiarostami was fully content with the scene. Kiarostami later commented that the breaking of scenes would have disrupted the rhythm and content of the film's structure, preferring to let the scene flow as one.|$|E

Clarissa guesses that Miranda and Costello's real motive is to obtain money from Henry and she accuses him of blackmail, a word overheard by Elgin just <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>enters</b> the room to tell Clarissa {{that he and his wife}} are off out. When he has gone, Clarissa, in turn, threatens to expose Costello and Miranda's drug activities. Pippa comes into the room, appalled to see Costello there as she is terrified of the man. Clarissa throws him out of the house with the help of Miss Peake and Clarissa calms the hysterical Pippa down and sends her for her bath.|$|E
25|$|Will {{returns to}} The Great Hall, and learns the form each sign will take. Will reveals {{the first sign}} within Gwen’s pendant. As the sign-seeker, Will travels through time to find the next four signs. The Rider enlists a mysterious figure {{to help him get}} the signs from Will. When Will's brother invites Maggie to their home, she reveals some of her powers to Will. Will reveals his {{affections}} for her, saying he felt an instant connection with her. He tells her he has been thinking of her constantly. The Rider also tricks Will's older brother Max, using his magic to partially control him. The spell over Max is finally broken when Will uses his great strength to give Max a concussion. By the fifth day, The Dark that The Rider commands has now gained tremendous power and begins to attack the village with a terrible blizzard. Will locates the fifth sign but without the sixth sign, the Dark continues to rise. Maggie is revealed to be the mysterious witch helping the Rider in exchange for immortal youth. She is betrayed by him (for failing to get ANY of the signs) when she fails to get the fifth sign and ages rapidly, disintegrating into a flood of water while trying to steal them from Will. The Old Ones and Will seek sanctuary in the Great Hall, where the Rider cannot enter unless invited. However, The Rider's final trick (impersonating the voices of Will's mother and father, as well as Gwen) gains him access to The Great Hall. The Rider reveals that he has trapped Tom, whom The Rider mistook for The Seeker and kidnapped, within a glass sphere (and apparently took care of all these years). He sends Will into an evil dark cloud. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>enters,</b> Will solves the riddle of the sixth sign: he himself is the sixth sign. With all six signs identified The Rider cannot touch nor harm Will. Using his power over the dark, Will banishes both The Rider – imprisoning the evil figure within one of his own glass spheres – and The Dark. The sphere disappears into murky water. Will and Tom are reunited and return to their family, who are shocked to see Tom.|$|E

500|$|Robert Patrick makes a cameo {{appearance}} in Wayne's World (1992) as the T-1000 {{character in a}} scene where he pulls Wayne's car over, holds up a photo of John Connor and asks, [...] "Have you seen this boy?", to which Wayne, being presumably a fan of The Terminator franchise and knowing T-1000 as a time-travelling assassin, screams in panic and drives away from him. Patrick also makes a cameo appearance as the T-1000 in Last Action Hero (1993), when he is seen walking by Schwarzenegger <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>enters</b> Los Angeles Police Department headquarters. In the same film, actor Sylvester Stallone is featured as the Terminator on a Terminator2 poster instead of Schwarzenegger. In Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993), a caricature of Saddam Hussein is frozen, shattered, and reformed in a direct parody of the T-1000 from the final scene of Terminator2.|$|E

As he continues to explore, he encounters a multitude of panicking Russians, all of whom attack him. He also finds several horrifically mutilated bodies, including that of the Ravenswoods captain, Lt. Lansing. Hansen soon learns of a creature known as an [...] "exocel", which was accidentally discovered by the crew of a Russian oil rig, the Star of Sakhalin, owned by Colonel Dmitriy Yusupov, a member of the Russian mafia, and staffed by Major Yuri Anischenko and his team of mercenaries. Yusupov came to realize the exocels were parasitic organisms, which used other living organisms as hosts, and as such, he brought Dr. Viktor Kamsky to the Sakhalin to begin experimenting with infecting various species with exocel serum. These experiments led to the discovery that exocels could re-animate recently deceased humans, and the creation of an antidote to counter infection. Hansen heads to the radio room to request help, but instead he is answered by Bennett, who tells him that Yusupov is on board and must be captured for questioning. Bennett tells Hansen that if he finds Yusupov, the CIA will get him off the ship.|$|E

500|$|After Shao Kahn's {{invasion}} of Earthrealm is halted by Raiden's forces of light, Raiden blasts and sends Kahn through a portal. At {{exactly the same}} time on Earth, Superman stops Darkseid's Apokoliptian invasion by blasting Darkseid with his heat vision <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>enters</b> a boom tube. These acts do not destroy either of them, but merge them into Dark Kahn, and causes the DC and Mortal Kombat universes to merge. As this happens, the characters' abilities fluctuate, causing violent [...] "rage" [...] outbreaks that are actually the feelings of Dark Kahn being infused in the characters from afar. Because of this, certain characters gain either strength or vulnerability. This allows for such things [...] as the possibility of Superman being defeated due to his vulnerability to magic, and giving the Joker the ability to fight skilled martial artists such as his nemesis Batman and Deathstroke. With each world thinking that the other {{is responsible for the}} merger, they fight each other until only one fighter from each side remains: Raiden and Superman. In the final battle, the two fight while Dark Kahn feeds on their rage. Both realizing that the other is not working with Dark Kahn, they overcome their rage for each other and defeat their fused enemy, restoring the two worlds to their normal separation. While everyone else has been sent to their original universe, Darkseid and Shao Kahn have been switched and are both rendered powerless. In the end, they both face eternal imprisonment in the other's universe; Darkseid is restrained in the Netherealm, while Shao Kahn is trapped in the Phantom Zone.|$|E
500|$|Bruce Campbell, {{a long-time}} {{colleague}} of director Sam Raimi, has a cameo as the announcer at the wrestling ring Peter takes part in. Years later, Jeffrey Henderson, {{who worked on}} the storyboards for the cancelled Spider-Man 4 movie, released information regarding which villains would appear within the movie. One of those included Bruce Campbell's character's progression into Quentin Beck / Mysterio. Ted Raimi, Sam Raimi's actor brother, plays a small role as editor's assistant [...] "Hoffman". Sam Raimi himself appeared off-screen, throwing popcorn at Peter <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>enters</b> the arena to wrestle Bonesaw McGraw. Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee also has a cameo, in which he asks Peter, [...] "Hey kid, would you like a pair of these glasses? They're the kind they wore in X-Men." [...] The scene was cut, and Lee only briefly appears in the film to grab a young girl from falling debris during the battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin in Times Square. R/soul singer Macy Gray appears as herself. One of the stunt performers in the film is actor Johnny Tri Nguyen. Robert Kerman, best known for his performances in pornographic and exploitation films, has a bit part as a tugboat captain. Lucy Lawless makes a cameo as a punk rock girl. It was also intended for Hugh Jackman to make an appearance in the film as Logan / Wolverine, reprising the role from 2000's X-Men, but a dispute between Sony and 20th Century Fox over the characters' film rights prevented it from happening. The novelization of Spider-Man identifies Liz Allan as the character portrayed by Sally Livingstone.|$|E
