25|$|Cut off wheels, {{also known}} as parting wheels, are {{self-sharpening}} wheels that are thin in width and often have radial fibres reinforcing them. They are often used {{in the construction industry}} for cutting reinforcement bars (rebar), protruding bolts or anything that needs quick removal or trimming. Most handymen would recognise an <b>angle</b> <b>grinder</b> and the discs they use.|$|E
50|$|<b>Angle</b> <b>grinders</b> can be {{powered by}} an {{electric}} motor, petrol engine or compressed air. The motor drives a geared head at a right-angle on which is mounted an abrasive disc or a thinner cut-off disc, either {{of which can}} be replaced when worn. <b>Angle</b> <b>grinders</b> typically have an adjustable guard and a side-handle for two-handed operation. Certain <b>angle</b> <b>grinders,</b> depending on their speed range, can be used as sanders, employing a sanding disc with a backing pad or disc. The backing system is typically made of hard plastic, phenolic resin, or medium-hard rubber depending on the amount of flexibility desired.|$|R

25|$|In May 1998, armed Gardaí {{attached}} to the Emergency Response Unit shot dead {{a member of the}} Provisional IRA terrorist group, during an attempted robbery of a cash-in-transit van carrying £300,000 Irish pounds (€380,000 in Euro) in Ashford, County Wicklow. The gang of six had been under surveillance by a number of Garda units, including the National Surveillance Unit (NSU) and Special Detective Unit at the time. The armed raiders posed as county council workmen before blocking the road to stop the bank van. The gang was armed with an assault rifle, pump-action shotgun, revolver, imitation rocket launcher and an <b>angle</b> <b>grinder.</b> When the ERU moved in and foiled the robbery, 28-year-old Ronan McLoughlin was fatally shot by heavily armed ERU officers as he attempted to flee in a vehicle. 10 shots were fired by Gardaí, who had 25 firearms on scene. Nobody else was shot. Five gang members were arrested and later found guilty of terrorism offences.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, {{within a}} week of the return of Yagan's head to Perth, vandals {{beheaded}} the statue using an <b>angle</b> <b>grinder.</b> Soon after a replacement head was installed and it too was detached and stolen. Credit for the act was anonymously claimed by a [...] "British loyalist" [...] as an act of retaliation for Colbung's comments about Diana, Princess of Wales. The Western Australia Police did not succeed in identifying the vandals, nor in recovering the heads, and deemed it infeasible to have the statue fenced off or placed under guard.|$|E

50|$|Viktim {{is known}} for a high-energy in your face stage show that {{includes}} strobe lights, firebreathing, fog machines, crunching guitars, and most notably they perform with <b>Angle</b> <b>Grinders</b> on stage. Some of the other highlights have included climbing twenty-foot-high speaker columns and diving into the crowd after angle grinding on them, suspension of members from the lighting rigging in the ceiling rafters, and audience participation as gang vocals. Reviews in magazines such as Culture Asylum describe these shows in detail, from the crunching guitars to the blinding strobes, and hot steel of the <b>angle</b> <b>grinders.</b>|$|R
2500|$|On-stage theatrics {{included}} Ogre being {{suspended from}} racks and cables, {{play with a}} hangman's noose, Key cutting steel with an <b>angle</b> <b>grinder,</b> and mock executions of Ogre and George H.W. Bush. Following the 2004 Presidential Election in the United States, promoters began to ask the band to refrain from using fake blood during their performances. This reaction was prompted by {{the performance of a}} mock execution on stage, during which Ogre was decapitated by actors dressed as then U.S. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. The band was also asked by Samsung (who had been asked by Ogre to sponsor the band with a large flat screen) to [...] "not insult the president" [...] while performing on stage. In a 1987 television interview with Kim Clarke Champniss, Key explained that while Ogre follows a [...] "rough guideline" [...] during a live performance, a majority of his on-stage theatrics are thought up of spontaneously. Key told Champniss that Ogre's demeanor on stage could [...] "range from just a sort of laid back kind of lurking to a rampant psycho". Ogre once remarked that touring was, for himself, like [...] "dating hydrogen peroxide", referencing the numerous injuries which he would acquire over the course of touring.|$|E

50|$|A {{disc cutter}} is a specialised, often hand-held, power tool used for cutting hard materials, for example ceramic tile.

5000|$|The <b>angle</b> <b>grinder</b> {{was invented}} in 1954 by German company Ackermann + Schmitt (FLEX-Elektrowerkzeuge GmbH) in Steinheim an der Murr. Owing to this, in German, Dutch, Slovak, Czech, Croatian, Latvian, Romanian, Hungarian and Bulgarian (and {{possibly}} in other languages), an <b>angle</b> <b>grinder</b> is colloquially called just a [...] "flex".|$|E

50|$|Some <b>angle</b> <b>{{grinders}},</b> most tile saws, {{and some}} grinders for sharpening blades used in woodworking are wet grinders. The fluid helps with lubrication of the cutting process and with cooling to avoid cracking or damaging {{the cutting tool}} or the workpiece.|$|R
50|$|Through a sound {{pressure}} level and vibrations {{study conducted by the}} National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, grinders under an unloaded condition ranged from 91 to 103 dBA. In addition, <b>angle</b> <b>grinders</b> produce sparks when cutting ferrous metals. They also produce shards cutting other materials. The blades themselves may also break. This is a great hazard to the face and eyes especially, as well as other parts of the body, and as such, a full face shield and other protective clothing must be worn. <b>Angle</b> <b>grinders</b> should never be used without their guard or handle attached; they are there as a necessary precaution for safety. All work should be securely clamped or held firmly in a vice.|$|R
50|$|<b>Angle</b> <b>grinders</b> {{are widely}} used in {{metalworking}} and construction, {{as well as in}} emergency rescues. They are commonly found in workshops, service garages and auto body repair shops. There is a large variety of <b>angle</b> <b>grinders</b> to choose from when trying to find the right one for the job. The most important factors in choosing the right grinder are the disc size and how powerful the motor is. Other factors include power source (pneumatic or electric), rpm, and arbor size. Generally disc size and power increase together. Disc size is usually measured in inches or millimetres. Common disc sizes for <b>angle</b> <b>grinders</b> in the U.S.A. include 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 12 inches. Discs for pneumatic grinders also come much smaller. Pneumatic grinders are generally used for lighter duty jobs where more precision is required. This is likely because pneumatic grinders can be small and light yet remain powerful, because they do not contain heavy copper motor windings, while it is harder for an electric grinder to maintain adequate power with smaller size. Electric grinders are more commonly used for larger, heavy duty jobs. However, there are also small electric grinders and large pneumatic grinders.|$|R
