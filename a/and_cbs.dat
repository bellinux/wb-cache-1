40|$|Background Anxiety <b>and</b> {{challenging}} behaviour (<b>CB)</b> {{often occur}} simultaneously {{in people with}} intellectual disabilities (ID). Understanding the associations between anxiety <b>and</b> <b>CB</b> may contribute to more accurate diagnoses and management of both anxiety <b>and</b> <b>CB</b> in this population. Aims To {{examine the relationship between}} anxiety <b>and</b> <b>CB.</b> Methods A literature review covering the period from January 2000 to January 2012. Results Seven studies about the relationship between psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, <b>and</b> <b>CB</b> were identified. These studies confirm the relationship between anxiety <b>and</b> <b>CB</b> in people with ID, although the precise nature of this relationship remains unclear. Conclusions The study points toward the existence of a moderate association between anxiety <b>and</b> <b>CB.</b> Further research is needed to clarify the complex nature of the association between anxiety <b>and</b> <b>CB...</b>|$|R

5|$|Despite {{no history}} of radio {{programming}} or stable of radio stars to draw on and perennial cash shortages, DuMont was an innovative and creative network. Without the radio revenues that supported mighty NBC <b>and</b> <b>CBS,</b> DuMont programmers relied on their wits and on connections with Broadway. Eventually, the network provided original programs that are remembered more than 60 years later.|$|E
5|$|DuMont {{programs}} were by necessity low-budget affairs, {{and the network}} received relatively few awards from the TV industry.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{encapsulation}} of vegetable organogels in alginate microparticles (MPs). Mango butter (MB) <b>and</b> cocoa butter (<b>CB)</b> are natural organogels which are {{being used in the}} preparation of pharmaceutical formulations. In addition to these, mustard oil (MO) was used as the control. The thermal stability of MB <b>and</b> <b>CB</b> can be enhanced by encapsulating them and can be used in oral drug delivery formulations. Double emulsification method was followed for the preparation of MPs. By this method, spherical MPs were synthesized and the sphericity was confirmed by doing light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The size range of MPs was 107 ± 53 μm, 79 ± 43 μm and 112 ± 78 μm for MPs encapsulating MO, MB <b>and</b> <b>CB,</b> respectively. The melting endotherms of MPs with MB <b>and</b> <b>CB</b> were in exact match with the melting points of MB <b>and</b> <b>CB.</b> This confirmed the existence of MB <b>and</b> <b>CB</b> within the MPs. Encapsulation MB <b>and</b> <b>CB</b> has caused a significant change in the amorphousity of the MPs, which subsequently affected their drug release pattern. The drug release kinetics suggested that the release pattern followed the non-Fickian kinetics. The MPs were found to be hemocompatible in nature and have shown good mucoadhesive and swelling properties. Based on the preliminary results, it was suggested that the vegetable organogels can be encapsulated in alginate microparticles and used as drug delivery vehicles...|$|R
