40|$|In the Old-Polish Industrial Region (Southern Poland, Central Europe), {{specific}} {{remnants of}} former iron-ore extraction occur. These interesting post-mining habitats influence the plant cover which emerges on them. In this paper, I analyzed {{the impact of}} the former iron-ore mining on the increase of plant species richness in forest communities. I analyzed the floristic composition of 100 phytosociological relevés (plots) made in the mining areas, their surroundings and 100 associated soil samples. I found that within the island communities developing in the former mining fields, there was a considerable {{increase in the number of}} species of native flora (in comparison with communities of nontransformed areas). This increase in species richness is caused chiefly by the increased proportion of species characteristic of the syntaxa from the Querco-Fagetea class – species exclusively attached to the mesophilous forest communities developing in gob piles whose limits are marked by the material extracted and scattered around in ancient times. My research suggested that in this case, mining activity exerted a positive influence on the biodiversity in forested areas, improving the quality of soils and creating mesophilous forest communities growing on remnants of former iron-ore extraction, which are specific islands among <b>acidophilous</b> <b>forest</b> communities growing in the non-transformed areas...|$|E
40|$|Questions. How did the {{presence}} of forest roads modify plant diversity and composition in a nutrient-poor environment? What was {{the effect of the}} use of limestone gravel as road surfacing material? How did floristic succession vary between roadside and forest interior? Location. State Forest of Orléans, Loiret, Northern France. Methods. We sampled thirty pairs of 2000 -m² plots, one on road and the other 30 m inside forest, on two road surfacing materials (limestone gravel and bare soil) and three stand ages (young, middle-aged, and mature) in Scots and Corsican pine stands in a large managed forest. Plant diversity was analysed according to life-history traits (protection status, indigenousness, life form, habitat and ecological preferences). We tested the effects of plot position, road type and stand age on species richness, species composition and individual species response. Results. The species richness of all plant groups was always higher on roads compared to forest stands, and the forest plot communities were nearly completely nested within the roadside plot communities. Seven protected species and four non-native potentially invasive species were observed on roadsides. Limestone gravelled roads hosted more species than bare soil roads, but <b>acidophilous</b> <b>forest</b> and grassland species richness was higher on bare soil roads. Plant composition similarity between the roadside and forest were higher at early successional stages and lower in older stages. Conclusions. Roads have inseparable positive and negative effects on plant communities, but the negative ones are of great concern. To prevent further damage in these nutrient-poor ecosystems, we recommend monitoring road sections hosting protected acidophilous species, not increasing road density, and replacing limestone gravel by a low-pH endogenous material...|$|E

40|$|Floristic {{survey of}} the natural {{monument}} Vinice (district Příbram) was conducted during growing seasons in 2012 and 2015. The study area is located near Jince {{and it is important}} paleontological deposit of Cambrian fauna. The aim of this thesis was a floristic inventory of vascular plant species, with a focus on validation of endangered and exotic species occurrence. The thesis also includes an evaluation of previous work results and current treatment interventions in context with the management plan. In the natural monument Vinice, there were 61 vascular plant species inventoried on selected parts of the monitored area in 2015 (in 2012, there were 47 plans species determined, excluding families Poaceae, Juncaceae and Cyperaceae). Presence of two endangered species was confirmed in both years, while another three previously recorded (in year 2006) endangered species were not found at the study area in 2015. Five alien species were recorded in 2015, of which the black locust (Robinia pseudacacia) and small balsam (Impatiens parviflora) are invasive nature. Potential threat to the locality can be common broom (Cytisus scoparius), although it is not considered as an invasive species in the Czech Republic. On the basis of floristic inventories four main habitats were indicatively set (Hercynian oak - hornbeam forests, herb-rich beech <b>forests,</b> <b>acidophilous</b> thermophilous oak <b>forests</b> and dry <b>acidophilous</b> oak <b>forests).</b> To preserve this valuable paleontological and also botanical site is recommended to follow the management plan for the period 2007 - 2016, where the appropriate interventions are described.

40|$|The {{overgrown}} coppice oak {{forests that}} cover the southern slopes beneath {{the foothills of the}} Sudetes (Silesia, Central Europe)  are considered to be Euro-Siberian steppic woods with a Quercus sp. habitat (91 I 0) : a priority habitat in the European Union, according to the Natura 2000 system. In subcontinental parts of Central Europe, thermophilous oak forest vegetation is found extrazonally; its presence, in the study site, is related to previous coppice management. In this paper we explore the differentiation of the vegetation caused both by land-relief derived variables (potential heat load, slope inclination and exposition, soil depth) and soil pH, as well as spatial processes. The data on the vegetation were collected from 117 regularly arranged sampling plots, located in three mountain ranges. The vegetation consisted of a mixture of species considered as typical for different habitats (mesophilous <b>forests,</b> <b>acidophilous</b> <b>forests,</b> thermophilous oak forests, grassland, thermophilous fringes and mesophilous mantle) and was relatively rich in species. Many of the species found were rare and are protected in Poland. The results of the bioindication, on the basis of Ellenberg indicator values, suggest the pH gradient to be the most important, followed by the insolation/moisture gradient, to the differentiation of the studied vegetation. The thermophilous oak forests seem to occupy the niche between <b>acidophilous</b> and mesophilous <b>forest.</b> However the decomposition of spatial variation, assessed on the basis of semivariance values of the vegetation similarity coefficient (frequency index), emphasizes a strong differentiation of vegetation between sites and mountain ranges. 			 			The results of canonical correspondence analysis, performed on a spatially stratified sub-set of the data, revealed a stronger effect caused by spatial variation (32. 7 % of explained species variation) than environmental variables, such as soil pH and potential heat load (13. 1 %). Since the shared variation was low (1. 8 %), it showed a strong influence of spatial processes, revealing the effect of the local species pool...|$|R

40|$|Rare epixylic moss Buxbaumia viridis, {{which is}} one of the “Annex II” species of the European “Habitat directive”, has been {{recorded}} at 124 localities in the Czech Republic in course of the last 13 years. Most of them were discovered in the last five years following a dedicated search at both historical sites of occurrence and new localities with putatively suitable habitat conditions. The recent and historical area of occupancy and extent of occurrence are not obviously different, although most of the recent localities are concentrated in the Western Carpathians and the Hrubý Jeseník Mts. Surprisingly, only 38 % of the localities are located in natural forest habitats, of which herb-rich and <b>acidophilous</b> beech <b>forests</b> were among the most commonly inhabited ones. The rest of occurrences were recorded in non-natural forests (habitats strongly influenced or created by man), particularly the coniferous forest plantations. Sufficient amount of decaying wood of the advanced decay stages, as well as sufficient and constant humidity are crucial prerequisites for the occurrence of B. viridis in both types of forests. True epixylic moss Herzogiella seligeri and the liverwort Chiloscyphus profundus were recorded as the most common associated species, while the rest of commonly co-occurring species were facultatively epixylic, ground or ubiquitous bryophytes; other specialized and rare epixylic mosses or liverworts were only rarely recorded. We also designed a potential distribution model for B. viridis based on the distribution of habitats most commonly occupied by the studied moss.

40|$|In coppice-with-standards, once {{a common}} type of {{management}} in Central European lowland forests, selected trees (standards) were left to grow mature among the regularly harvested coppice stools to obtain construction wood. After the underwood was harvested, the forest canopy opened rapidly, giving standard trees an opportunity to benefit from reduced competition. Although this silvicultural system virtually disappeared after WWII, historical management cycles can still be traced in the tree-rings of remaining standards. Our research aims at answering the question whether tree-ring series of standard trees {{can be used to}} reconstruct past management practices. The study was carried out on 117 oak standard trees from five sites situated in formerly coppiced calcareous oak-hornbeam and <b>acidophilous</b> oak <b>forests</b> in the Bohemian Karst Protected Landscape Area, Czech Republic. The evaluation was based on the analysis of growth releases representing the response of the standards to coppicing events, and comparison to the archival records of coppice events. Our results showed that coppicing events can be successfully detected by tree-ring analysis, although there are some limitations. Altogether 241 releases were identified (49 % of major releases). Large number of releases could be related to historical records, with the major ones giving better results. The overall probability of correct detection (positive predictive power) was 58 %, ranging from 50 to 67 %, probability for major releases was 78 %, ranging from 63 to 100 % for different sites. The ability of individual trees to mirror past coppice events was significantly affected by competition from neighboring trees (their number and the sum of distance-weighted basal areas).

40|$|The Little Carpathians Mountains {{include a}} {{vineyard}} region with long tradition {{that dates back}} up to the Roman Empire period (and according to some opinions, even earlier). In the late 19 th century, it was strongly impacted by the phylloxera epidemic, and the vineyard area has significantly reduced here. Large areas of the former vineyards are covered by forests, which mostly have formed spontaneously, but some of them were also planted. This contribution is focused on the impact of the former vineyard land use on the productivity (aboveground, belowground, and total biomass) of such forest herb layer. Research included also the forests, which occupy rocky mounds formed by rock gathering and their placement on the vineyard borders. There were sampled by following four stands, mostly differed by tree composition, origin, age, and succession stage: (i) up to 100 years old spontaneously formed thermophilous <b>acidophilous</b> oak <b>forest</b> on the former vineyard on the granite substrate, (ii) up to 100 years old spontaneously formed oak-dominated forest on the rocky (granite) mounds (borders between the former vineyards formed by rock gathering), (iii) 40 – 60 years old planted ash stands on the gneiss bedrock, and (iv) 40 – 60 years old planted ash-dominated stands on the rocky (gneiss) mounds. According to our results, the former land use modified original relief, where the former vineyards have modified soil profile and new relief forms rocky mounds were created. These mounds with no or just shallow soils are usually much less covered by vegetation, thus production of herb layer biomass is lower here than in the adjacent former vineyards. Moreover, rocky mounds show a higher ratio of synanthropic species and apophytes than the adjacent former vineyards, and same as for ratio of therophytes. The younger the stands on the former vineyards, the higher is the ratio of synanthropic species, apophytes, and therophytes. On the other hand, when estimating the production quantity, the values of herb layer production on the former vineyards are similar to those in natural oak-hornbeam forests found in the Little Carpathians Mts. and the adjacent regions, except for the rocky mounds covered by old oak forests, which are less productive. In other words, the former vineyard land use affects the herb layer production quality rather than quantity...|$|R
40|$|Pitomi kesten (Castanea sativa Mill.) je vrsta šumskog drveća koja u širem prostoru južne Europe, a tako i Hrvatske, ima izuzetnu gospodarsku, ali i ekološku vrijednost. Problematika sušenja kestena dovela je do zanemarivanja vrste i u gospodarskom i u istraživačkom smislu, no posebice fitocenološkom. Ovaj članak donosi rezultate višegodišnjih fitocenoloških istraživanja. Analizirani su originalni fitocenološki snimci sakupljeni s čitavog područja Hrvatske, s naglaskom na glavna područja rasprostiranja (Zrinska i Petrova gora, Medvednica). Utvrđena je i opisana nova asocijacija mezofilnih kestenovih šuma (Aposeri foetidae-Castanetum sativaeass. nova) koja se od već do sada poznatih i opisanih kestenovih šuma, osim u flornom sastavu, razlikuje i po glavnim ekološkim čimbenicima (klima, tlo i geomorfologija). Raščlanjena je na dvije subasocijacije:typicumiligustretosum vulgare, a svrstana u svezu ilirsko-dinarskih bukovih šumaAremonio-Fagion, podsvezuEpimedio-Fagenion. Gospodarenje je također odlučni čimbenik u formiranju kestenovih zajednica, njihovog opstanka i dugoročnog razvoja. Stoljetno obnavljanje kestenovih šuma čistim sječama rezultiralo je posebnom, široko rasprostranjenom i po flornom sastavu vrlo siromašnom varijantom Rubus hirtus, u okviru mezofilnih kestenovih šuma. This paper {{describes}} a new association of mesophilous sweet chestnut forests with odorous pig-salad (Aposeri foetidae-Castanetum sativaeass. nova) in Croatia. The association {{is the most}} frequently found at altitudes 200 – 400 m, which refers to sites at Zrinska and Petrova gora, or higher (up to 600 meters at Medvednica, Žumberak), in both cases in transitional positions between oak and beech or in the beech belt. It occurs on northern and eastern expositions and less steep slopes (up to 20 °), which distinguish it very good from the well known <b>acidophilous</b> sweet chestnut <b>forests</b> (Querco-Castanetum sativae), which occurs at southern and more steep slopes. The most common soil type in this community is luvisol, deep and very acid to light acid, depending on subassociation. It is characterized by considerably larger number of mesophilous species from beech <b>forests</b> than <b>acidophilous</b> and thermophilous species. Phytosociological releves were collected following the principles of standard Braun-Blanquet method. In Phytosociological Table 1 there are 20 relevés of the association Aposeri foetidae-Castanetum sativae. Sweet chestnut is frequently accompanied by beech and hornbeam in the tree layer. Oak is also frequent but without important and significant role that it plays in <b>acidophilous</b> chestnut <b>forests.</b> Sometimes there are cherry, lime-trees and flowering ash in the tree layer and often silver birch in the localities with more light related to chestnut decline. In the shrub layer, together with chestnut and beech, frequent and well developed are species from order Fagetalia and alliance Carpinion betuli: Corylus avellana, Carpinus betulus, Prunus avium, Crataegus monogyna, Acer campestre, Rosa arvensis and Viburnum opulus. The other group are species from the order Quercetalia pubescentis:Fraxinus ornus,Ligustrum vulgareand Sorbus torminalis, which occurs very frequent. The ground vegetation layer is very good developed and made from the mixture of mesophilous species from the order Fagetaliaand acidophilous species from the order Quercetalia roboris-petraeae. Frequent and abundant are only Rubus hirtusand Pteridium aquilinumwhich reflect the instability of the forest community. Important for the association and its characteristics species are Aposeris foetida,Circea lutetianaandGaleopsis tetrahit, which as mesophilous and skiophilous well describe assosiations character. Other species from the order Fagetaliaand the allianceCarpinion betuliare: Epimedium alpinum,Sanicula europaea,Symphytum tuberosum,Polygonatum multiflorum,Pulmonaria officinalis, Primula vulgaris,Viola reichenbachiana,Galium sylvaticum,Lonicera caprifolium,Carex sylvatica, Lamium orvala, and from the order Quercetalia roboris-petraeae:Gentiana asclepiadea,Veronica officinalis,Melampyrum pratense,Hieracium racemosum,Luzula luzuloides,Luzula pilosa. When the association is developed on the higher elevation, in the beech belt, spring aspect is expressed with a domination of theAnemone nemorosa,Dentaria bulbiferaandGalium odoratum. According to the Code of Phytocoenological Nomenclature (Weber et al. 2000), relevé No. 6 in the ninth column of Table 1 is the nomenclatural type. Two subassociations were identified: typicumandligustretosum. Aposeri foetidae-Castanetum sativaesubass. typicumsubass. nova hoc loc is negatively distinguished typical subassociation which growes on deep luvisols and on less steep slpoes (20 °). Shade-tolerant species such as Athyrium filix-femina, Dryopteris filix-mas and Circea lutetiana are dominant in abundance. This subassociation includes widely distributed, anthropogenic, poor in species number, variant Rubus hirtus. This community is very specific by its physiognomy which refers to pure chestnut stands. Shrub layer is also not developed and in the ground vegetation layer Rubus hirtuscovers often 75 % of the area. Interesting species is Hypericum androsaemum, rare in Croatian Flora, but it occurs frequently at this community. According to the Code of Phytocoenological Nomenclature (Weber et al. 2000), relevé No. 6 in the Table 1 is the nomenclatural type of the subassociation typicum. Aposeri foetidae-Castanetum sativaesubass. ligustretosum vulgarisubass. nova hoc locois more thermophilous subassociation, distinguished by differential species Ligustrum vulgare,Mellitys melissophyllum and Lathyrus niger. The subassociation is considering mixture of termophilous, acidophilous and mesophilous species rather rich in species number. It grows on less acid soils, often on carbonate substrates. According to the Code of Phytocoenological Nomenclature (Weber et al. 2000), relevé No. 12 in the Table 1 is the nomenclatural type of the subassociation ligustretosum. AssociationAposeri foetidae-Castanetum sativaeis classified to order Fagetalia Pawl. 1928, alliance of illyrian beech forests, Aremonio-Fagion (Horvat 1938) Törek et al. 1989, suballiance Epimedio-Fagenion Marinček i dr. 1993 which refers to mesophilous and subthermophilous collin forests of Ilirija. Characteristic (Epimedium alpinum,Geranium nodosum,Knautia drymeia,Vicia oroboides) and differential (Hacquetia epipactis,Heleborus odorus,Lonicera caprifolium,Primula vulgarisandRuscus hypoglossum) species of the suballiance are more frequent and abundant in the subassociationligustretosumthan in the typicum where shade-tolerant species playing the main role. Mesophilous chestnut forests Aposeri foetidae-Castanetum sativaeass. nova hoc loco represent the terminal phase of the chestnut forests in Croatia. Primary, it originates on deep and rich soils {{in most of the}} localities on Petrova and Zrinska gora, and secondary, from the association Epimedio-Carpinetum betuli, where chestnut occurs and become predominant because of the acidification processes in the soil (north-western Croatia, Moslavina, Slavonsko gorje). There are two possible directions of the degradation processes in these forests. First goes through the overexploitation, stamping and soil acidification to <b>acidophilous</b> chestnut <b>forest.</b> The other one, more important and present in whole range of Zrinska and Petrova gora, is exclusively conditioned by management system. A few generations after clear-cutting, mixed chestnut forest turn to chestnut monoculture with onlyRubus hirtusat the ground vegetation layer, which sometimes covers 100 % of the area...|$|R
40|$|Aluminium as {{a growth}} {{limiting}} factor {{has been recognized}} for many years. At high concentrations, aluminium (Al) ions reduce nutrient availability in soils, harm plant cells and thus inhibit plant growth. In addition, Al concentration may be a major factor filtering species composition on acid soils in favour of Al-resistant plants. In this study we analyse species responses and turnover along soil pH and Al gradients and we attempt {{to interpret the results}} with respect to the recognised aluminium solubility patterns. Plant community and soil data collected from mesophilous and <b>acidophilous</b> submontane broad-leaved <b>forests</b> of Western Slovakia were used for this purpose. Topsoil horizons were analysed for soil reaction (pH), organic carbon and extractable total aluminium. Species responses to the Al measurements were analysed and tested using CCA and the Huisman-Olff-Fresco (HOF) model. We calculated species turnover by accumulating the first derivatives of all HOF response curves, and interpreted them with respect to the Al solubility pattern observed in the soil dataset. We also performed a bioindication experiment to test how a species assemblage indicates the aluminium gradient. In total, 81 % of species shows a significant response to the soil Al gradient. We identified that a rapid retreat of many species and, in consequence, high compositional turnover (ecotone) corresponded with a discontinuity in Al solubility observed at 130 mg Al kg − 1 (pH 3. 8). Here, the exchangeable Al became increasingly under-saturated with respect to the equilibrium attained at higher pH. This discontinuity was also visible in the bioindication experiment, where the prediction algorithm operated better at the acidic end of the gradient. The results indicate that the studied plant assemblages respond sensitively to soil Al solubility. Changes in aluminium solubility in soils correspond with ecotone between adjacent types of vegetation...|$|R
