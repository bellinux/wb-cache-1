Exploit-ing {{the fact that the}} azimuth-elevation antenna pattern is 2 D ban-dlimited, the problem can be transformed into a 2 D spectral analysis problem. The proposed method first decomposes the 2 D spectral analysis problem into one-dimensional case and then solved them independently. As the solution does not ensure that the estimated azimuth and elevation is in correct order, the solution is subjected to permutation ambiguity. This can then be solved by finding the permutation that best matches the 2 D spectral representation.

40|$|Associations between {{cells and}} the basementmembrane are {{critical}} {{for a variety of}} biological events including cell proliferation, cell migration, cell differentiation and themaintenance of tissue integrity. Dystroglycan is a highly glycosylated basementmembrane receptor, and is involved in physiological processes that maintain integrity of the skeletal muscle, as well as development and function of the central nervous system. Aberrant O-glycosylation of the α subunit of this protein, and a concomitant loss of dystroglycan’s ability to function as a receptor for extracellular matrix (ECM) ligands that bear laminin globular (LG) domains, occurs in several congenital/limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (also referred to as dystroglycanopathies). Recent genetic studies revealed that mutations in DAG 1 (which encodes dystroglycan) and at least 17 other genes disrupt the ECM receptor function of dystroglycan and cause disease. Here, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the enzymatic func-tions of two of these disease genes: the like-glycosyltransferase (LARGE) and protein O-mannose kinase (POMK, previously referred to as SGK 196).

40|$|We have {{assessed}} {{the accuracy of}} a simplified integral equation (SIE) modeling approach for marine controlledsource electromagnetics (CSEM) with low applied frequencies and a resistive target. The most computationally intensive part of rigorous integral equation (IE) modeling is the computation of the anomalous electric field within the target itself. This leads to <b>amatrix</b> problem with a dense coefficient matrix. It is well known that, in general, the presence of many grid cells creates a computational disadvantage for densematrix methods compared to sparse-matrix methods. The SIE approach replaces the dense-matrix part of rigorous IE modeling by sparse-matrix calculations based on an approximation of Maxwell’s equations. The approximation is justified theoretically if a certain dimensionless parameter β is small. As opposed to approximations of the Born type, {{the validity of the}} SIE approach does not rely on the anomalous field to be small in comparison with the background field in the target region. We have calculated β for a range of parameter values typical for marine CSEM, and compared the SIE approach numerically to the rigorous IE method and to the quasi-linear (QL) and quasi-analytic (QA) approximate solutions. It is found that the SIE approach is very accurate for small β, corresponding to frequencies in the lower range of those typical for marine CSEM for petroleum exploration. In addition, the SIE approach is found to be significantly more accurate than the QL and QA approximations for small β...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT We have {{recently}} reported {{the isolation of}} a novel virus, provisionally designated C/swine/Oklahoma/ 1334 / 2011 (C/ OK), with 50 % overall homology to human influenza C viruses (ICV), from a pig in Oklahoma. Deep RNA sequencing of C/OK virus found <b>amatrix</b> 1 (M 1) protein expression strategy that differed from that of ICV. The novelty of C/OK virus prompted us to investigate whether C/OK virus could exist in a nonswine species. Significantly, we found that C/OK virus was widespread in U. S. bovine herds, as demonstrated by reverse transcription (RT) -PCR and serological assays. Genome sequencing of three bo-vine viruses isolated from two herds in different states further confirmed these findings. To determine whether swine/bovine C/OK viruses can undergo reassortment with human ICV, and to clarify the taxonomic status of C/OK, in vitro reassortment and serological typing by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) were conducted. In vitro reassortment using two human ICV and two swine and bovine C/OK viruses demonstrated that human ICV and C/OK viruses were unable to reassort and produce viable progeny. Antigenically, no cross-recognition of detergent split virions was observed in AGID between human and nonhuman viruses by using polyclonal antibodies that were reactive to cognate antigens. Taken together, these results demonstrate that C/OK virus is genetically and antigenically distinct from ICV. The classification of the new virus in a separate genus of theOrtho-myxoviridae family is proposed. The finding of C/OK virus in swine and bovine indicates that this new virus may spread and es-tablish infection in other mammals, including humans...|$|E

A campaign {{is considered to}} be a series of coordinatedflights delivering cargo at a location or node. <b>Amatrix</b> representation of the cargo carried by flights for consumption in different time periods (or missions) is formulated. The matrix adopts specific structures based on the nature of the campaign, thereby allowing a quick visualization of the campaign logistics properties. A logistics strategy index is proposed for quantifying manifesting strategies, and a flight criticality index is defined to help in identifying important flights from a cargo-delivery perspective and aid in assessing impact of flight cancellations, failures, and delays. The method is demonstrated on a lunar outpost establishment and is also applied in modeling the logistics of the International Space Station. Amanifest (M) matrix and flight dependency (D) matrix is created for crew provisions cargo delivered to the ISS over a period of 10 years.

Technology assessment, TA, sets science-based overlays of scenarios for each meaningful parameter to be compared. Conclusions are drawn from each scenario according to the context and priority for the linked parameters in the technology assessment. Meaningful TA has been a tradition in management, especially for the US astronaut moon landing in 1969 spurred by the sputnik dogs in 1959, {{the creation of an}} “impact statement” culture in the 1970 ’s and the energy scenarios for the Project Independence Evaluation System, PIES, presented to Congress in 1974. Unfortunately TA has degraded from the 1990 ’s with fake pseudoscientific public-mediapolitical agendas, particularly by environmentalists and green movements. Those assessments ignore the analysis of basic economic considerations, lifecycle costing, maintenance, performance efficiency and tangible impacts. There are further confusing features in their future agendas (US Green Building Council, USGBC) with a more focused approach to “social equity” and an increasing activity in government subsidies, tax credits, control, regulations, litigious solutions and conflicting design criteria. Thus this paper outlines the development of meaningful scenarios, methods of assessment and tangible priorities for today’s technology assessment based on viable science and responsible management. An example of an inefficient, costly, poor investment solar photovoltaic system for a classroom is used to illustrate the principles and to highlight the issues with alternative solutions...|$|E
