50|$|Amfepramone (INN) is a {{stimulant}} drug of the phenethylamine, amphetamine, and cathinone {{classes that}} is used as an appetite suppressant.

Amfepramone is most closely chemically related to the antidepressant and smoking cessation aid bupropion (previously called <b>amfebutamone),</b> which has also been developed as a weight-loss medicine when in a combination product with naltrexone.|$|E
40|$|Smoking {{accounts}} for significant {{morbidity and mortality}} and has major economic consequences for healthcare delivery throughout the world. Government policy such as increasing taxes and restricting advertising go some way to reduce smoking, but {{the social and economic}} factors that affect target populations will impact on the success of any strategy. Public health interventions can also contribute to increasing cessation rates. The most successful interventions appear to be those characterised by personalised advice and assistance, repeated in different forms over the longest feasible period of time. Pharmacological aids, which are important components of a cessation programme, include nicotine replacement therapy in the form of chewing gum, patches, nasal spray, oral inhaler or sublingual tablets; bupropion (<b>amfebutamone)</b> has been approved for use in some countries. As the community pharmacy is the major point of supply of such products, the pharmacist is in a key position to encourage and support clients who wish to stop smoking. A number of studies have examined the role of the community pharmacist in assisting smokers through the so-called `cycle of change'. These studies have utilised a model that offers individualised advice through a motivational technique to encourage a change in behaviour; nicotine replacement therapy is optional. Follow-up {{is an essential part of}} these programmes to monitor progress and to provide additional support. Evaluations of these pharmacy-based initiatives have confirmed the importance of a multifaceted approach in achieving success in smoking cessation, i. e. behaviour modification, nicotine replacement therapy and client support. <b>Amfebutamone,</b> Cognitive behavioural therapy, Drug withdrawal therapies, Nicotine, Patient education, Smoking withdrawal...|$|E
40|$|Background Tobacco {{smoking is}} {{associated}} with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) in more than 80 % of cases. Our aim was to investigate the effect of sustained-release bupropion (<b>amfebutamone)</b> (SR) in promoting abstinence from smoking in patients with COPD. Methods In a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial 404 individuals with mild or moderate COPD who smoked 15 or more cigarettes per day, were assigned bupropion SR (150 mg twice daily) or placebo for 12 weeks. All patients received smoking cessation counselling. Study medication was taken for 1 week before patients attempted to stop smoking. The primary efficacy endpoint was the complete and continuous abstinence from smoking from the beginning of week 4 to the end of week 7. Participants were followed up at month 6. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings All patients were chronic smokers with a smoking history of about 51 pack-years. Continuous smoking abstinence rates from week 4 to 7 were significantly higher in participants receiving bupropion SR than in those receiving placebo (28 % [57 / 204] vs 16 % [32 / 200], p= 0 · 003). Continuous abstinence rates from weeks 4 to 12 (18 % [36 / 204] vs 10 % [20 / 200]) and weeks 4 to 26 (16 % [32 / 204] vs 9 % [18 / 200]) were also higher in participants receiving bupropion SR than in those taking placebo (p< 0 · 05). Furthermore, symptoms of tobacco craving and withdrawal were attenuated in those receiving bupropion SR. Seven individuals discontinued study medication because of adverse events. Interpretation Bupropion SR is a well-tolerated and effective aid to smoking cessation in people with mild to moderat...|$|E
