Methyl linoleate could be separated by Column Chromatography mechanism technic partition from fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) mixture, then it was treated by ethanolamine at base condition in benzene as solvent and sodium methylate as a catalyst at reflux condition for 6 hours to form an <b>alkanolamide.</b> <b>Alkanolamide</b> could be epoxydized by tert-buthyl hydroperoxyde and peroxygenase as a catalyst and it was refluxed for 6 hours at 40 °C and nitrogen gas condition to form the epoxy <b>alkanolamide</b> octadecanoate, {{and then it was}} hydrolyzed by HCl 0. 1 M to form <b>alkanolamide</b> tetrahidroxy octadecanoate (Polyol). <b>Alkanolamide</b> tetrahidroxy octadecanoate could be separated by Column Chromatography using silica gel H 40 and the eluent was the mixture of chloroform, ethyl acetate, formic acid in a ratio 90 : 10 : 1 (v/v/v/). Determination of HLB value from alknolamide tetrahydroxy octadecanoate is 13. 096. Therefore, this compound was particularly suitable for application as an o/w emulsifiers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the effect of drying time on the mechanical properties of natural rubber latex filled with cassava peel waste modified <b>alkanolamide.</b> Cassava peel is a waste, containing cellulose which is potential as fillers in natural rubber latex products. Cassava peel waste was dried and milled until the size of 100 mesh. <b>Alkanolamide</b> is one type of non-ionic surfactant which is synthesized from RBDPS (Refined Bleached Deodorized Palm Stearin) and diethanolamine. <b>Alkanolamide</b> has polar group which can modified cassava peel waste and make strong chemical bonding with natural rubber latex. The production of natural rubber latex products was started from pre-vulcanization at 70 °C until the system was cured and the chloroform number has reached number 3. Natural rubber latex was formed into films by coagulant dipping and drying method at 120 °C for 10 minutes and 20 minutes. Results show that longer drying time will improve the crosslink density and tensile strength of natural rubber latex products until the addition of 15 phr cassava peel waste powde...|$|E
3000|$|Due to the {{problems}} mentioned above, several surfactant–polymer flooding free of alkali pilot tests {{have been carried out}} in some China’s oil fields, such as Shengli, Dagang and Henan (Zhu et al. 2012). The key for the surfactant–polymer flooding is to find a well-performed surfactant that could reduce the interfacial tension between oil and water to ultra-low values. Many researchers tried to use mixed surfactants including: petroleum sulfonate formulations (Xiong et al. 2009), <b>alkanolamide</b> mixtures (Meng et al. 2010), <b>alkanolamide</b> with petroleum sulfonate (Li et al. 2010), Span with alkyl polyglycoside (Iglauer et al. 2004), mixed polyoxypropylene ether sulfates (Shinoda and Shibata 1986 [...]...|$|E
50|$|The {{considerations}} in 3 and 4 frequently {{result in a}} much greater multiplicity of surfactants being used in individual baby shampoos than in other shampoos, and the detergency and/or foaming of such products may be compromised thereby.

40|$|Abstract — Candida Antarctica lipase is {{well known}} to convert amines and {{alcohols}} into amides and esters. This report describes {{the development of a}} solvent-free enzymatic process for the production of fatty <b>alkanolamides.</b> The aminolysis of linoleyl ethyl ester with several aminoalcohols from C 2 to C 6 (linear or branched compounds), and the very high selectivity of amide compounds has been observed. Our investigation leads us to develop an original biotechnological process for the chemoselective synthesis of new active molecules for cutaneous application...|$|R
40|$|Methyl esters {{have been}} widely used as the {{intermediate}} componds for a number of derivative products in oleochemical indutries, such as fatty alcohol, <b>alkanolamide,</b> monostearat glycerol and surfactant. The purpose of this research is to study the kinetics of amidation from methyl ester and diethanolamide by using sulfuric acid catalyst. The amidation that is the reaction between methyl ester and diethanolamine was held in a glass, batch reactor for 8 hours with mole ratio 1 : 1 using acid catalyst (H 2 SO 4 0, 5...|$|E
40|$|The ergot fungus Claviceps purpurea {{produces}} both ergopeptines {{and simple}} d-lysergic acid alkylamides. In the ergopeptines, such as ergotamine, d-lysergic acid {{is linked to}} a bicyclic tripeptide in amide-like fashion, whereas in the d-lysergylalkanolamides it is linked to an amino alcohol derived from alanine. We show here that these compound classes are synthesized {{by a set of}} three non-ribosomal lysergyl peptide synthetases (LPSs), which interact in a combinatorial fashion for synthesis of the relevant product. The trimodular LPS 1 assembles with LPS 2, the d-lysergic acid recruiting module, to synthesize the d-lysergyltripeptide precursors of ergopeptines from d-lysergic acid and the three amino acids of the peptide chain. Alternatively, LPS 2 can assemble with a distinct monomodular non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) subunit (ergometrine synthetase) to synthesize the d-lysergic acid <b>alkanolamide</b> ergometrine from d-lysergic acid and alanine. The synthesis proceeds via covalently bound d-lysergyl alanine and release of dipeptide as alcohol with consumption of NADPH. Enzymatic and immunochemical analyses showed that ergometrine synthetase is most probably the enzyme LPS 3 whose gene had been identified previously as part of the ergot alkaloid biosynthesis gene cluster in C. purpurea. Inspections of all LPS sequences showed no recognizable peptide linkers for their protein-protein interactions as in NRPS subunits of bacteria. Instead, they all carry conserved N-terminal domains (C 0 -domains) with similarity to the C-terminal halves of NRPS condensation domains pointing to an alternative mechanism of subunit-subunit interactions in fungal NRPS systems. Phylogenetic analysis of LPS modules and the C 0 -domains suggests that these enzyme systems most probably evolved by module duplications and rearrangements from a bimodular ancestor...|$|E

40|$|An {{environmentally}} {{benign and}} volume efficient process for enzymatic production of <b>alkanolamides</b> is described. Immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B, Novozym (R) 435, {{was used to}} catalyze the condensation of lauric acid with monothanolamine. The raction temperature of 90 degrees C was required to keep the reactants in a liquid state. Atepwise addition of the amine minimized problems caused by {{the formation of a}} highly viscous amine/fatty acid ion pair. The enzyme was both very active and stable under the reaction conditions, with about half of the activity remaining after 2 weeks. The maximum amide yield obtained when using equimolar amounts of the r 4 eaction wa 75 %, which could be increased to 95 % upon water removal.

40|$|Shampoos are {{products}} which remove surface grease and dirt from the hair shaft and scalp. The cleansing or detergent action of a shampoo {{is a primary}} function. However, the foaming characteristic of a shampoo has {{an important role in}} its acceptability. Often <b>alkanolamides</b> are used for the formation of a stable foam; but because of producing nitrosamines, they are potentially carcinogenic compounds. Hence, the main goal of this study was the elimination of these materials from shampoo formulations. Acanthophyllum squarrosum is one of the 23 species of the genus Acanthophyllum endemic in Iran. Due to the presence of saponin in its root, chubak, has been used traditionally as a detergent. In this study, total saponins of Acanthophyllum squarrosum roots were extracted, using several solvents. A clear liquid shampoo base was formulated using Texapon as surfactant, sodium chloride as thickener, glycerin as viscosity modifier, methyl paraben as preservative and EDTA as sequestring agent. Then, a fixed amount of Texapon was substituted by 1, 2. 5 and 5 percent of total herbal saponins. Foaming ability of the shampoos prepared was evaluated by the Ross-Miles method and the cleansing power by Thompson test. The best result was found with the formula containing 20 % Texapon and 5 % total herbal saponins. Therefore, this formulation was selected as the best formula and evaluated for other characteristics. In addition to possessing the properties of a liquid shampoo, the unique characteristics of the formula containing 5 % total herbal saponins was that it produced a stable foam without the use of foam stabilizers. Evaluation of the cleansing power by Thompson test showed that the final formula is a shampoo for normal hair, with very good cleansing ability. Rheological studies showed that the final formula had a pseudoplastic behavior. Organoleptic and physicochemical characteristics of the final formula were all found to be acceptable...|$|R
