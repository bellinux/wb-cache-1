In 1997, Israeli agents entered Jordan using Canadian passports and poisoned Khaled Meshal, a senior Hamas leader. Israel provided <b>an</b> <b>antidote</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> poison and released dozens of political prisoners, including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin after King Hussein threatened to annul the peace treaty.|$|E

With the help of the life-size patchwork doll named Scraps, Bungle the snobbish Glass Cat (another of Dr. Pipt's creations), the Woozy, Dorothy, the Shaggy Man, and the Scarecrow, Ojo gathers all of these supplies but the left wing – the Tin Woodman, who rules the yellow Winkie Country, which is the only place where yellow butterflies grow, will not allow any living thing to be killed, even to save another's life.|$|E

500|$|The soundtrack {{received}} positive reviews, with [...] "Avalukkenna" [...] being {{particularly well}} received. Pradeep Madhavan of The Hindu (Tamil) states that [...] "Avalukkenna" [...] brought out Nagesh's dancing potential onscreen. M. N. Bhaskaran {{of the same}} newspaper appreciated the clarinet interludes in [...] "Avalukkena". A reviewer from Radio Mirchi wrote that [...] "Avalukkenna" [...] provided {{a new concept to}} Tamil cinema in terms of lyrics, music and dance. Balachander commented on that song, [...] "Songs like 'Avalukkenna.. [...] Listen to them today, and they will seem so fresh and amazing. [...] music is the kind that will challenge directors to come up with impressive visualisation." [...] Baradwaj Rangan, writing for The Hindu, said, [...] "Listen to the lazy drawl with which certain words taper off in ‘Avalukkenna,’ <b>an</b> <b>antidote</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rock ‘n’ roll bounce {{in the rest of the}} song." [...] Poga Poga Theriyum" [...] was later included in Old is Gold, an album compiling hit songs from films featuring Muthuraman, and was rated by The Times of India as one of the album's [...] "hot picks".|$|E
500|$|Nude as the News stated that, {{although}} {{the record is}} [...] "more reserved" [...] than the band's previous releases, it [...] "conjures up images of the Welsh winter in which the songs were recorded" [...] and fits in with the group's [...] "unique vision." [...] Melody Maker described the album as a [...] "sad, beautiful record", but {{expressed concern that the}} Super Furry Animals had moved away from the pop of Guerilla and called on them to deliver another release in the vein of the band's 1996 single [...] "The Man Don't Give a Fuck". Nevertheless, Mwng was ranked number 24 in the magazine's [...] "Albums of the year 2000" [...] feature. Website SonicNet described the record as a slightly retro album that sees the Super Furry Animals [...] "refashion the past into the present". Art Sperl, writing for Rock's Backpages in December 2000, stated that {{although the}} album [...] " [...] from the past", the band's influences are channelled [...] "into a truly organic maverick pop". [...] NME described Mwng as <b>an</b> <b>antidote</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> [...] "preservative pumped-junk" [...] music that they felt was prevalent {{at the time of the}} album's release, and placed it at number nine in their album of the year list for 2000, calling it the group's best record. The magazine also described the album as the most accessible Super Furry Animals release, despite its Welsh-language lyrics. Rhys has stated that he considers Mwng to be a [...] "really pure record".|$|E
500|$|With Wilson {{credited}} as producer, the Mothers of Invention, {{augmented by}} a studio orchestra, recorded the groundbreaking Freak Out! (1966), which, after Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde, {{was the second}} rock double album ever released. It mixed R, doo-wop, musique concrète, and experimental sound collages that captured the [...] "freak" [...] subculture of Los Angeles at that time. Although he was dissatisfied with the final product, Freak Out immediately established Zappa as a radical new voice in rock music, providing <b>an</b> <b>antidote</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> [...] "relentless consumer culture of America". The sound was raw, but the arrangements were sophisticated. While recording in the studio, some of the additional session musicians were shocked that {{they were expected to}} read the notes on sheet music from charts with Zappa conducting them, since it was not standard when recording rock music. The lyrics praised non-conformity, disparaged authorities, and had dadaist elements. Yet, there was a place for seemingly conventional love songs. Most compositions are Zappa's, which set a precedent {{for the rest of his}} recording career. He had full control over the arrangements and musical decisions and did most overdubs. Wilson provided the industry clout and connections and was able to provide the group with the financial resources needed. Although Wilson was able to provide Zappa and the Mothers with an extraordinary degree of artistic freedom for the time, the recording did not go entirely as planned. In a surviving 1967 radio interview, Zappa explained that the album's outlandish 11-minute closing track, [...] "Return of the Son of Monster Magnet" [...] was in fact an unfinished piece. The track (as it appears on the album) was created to act as the backing track for a much more complex work, but MGM refused to approve the additional recording time Zappa needed to complete it, so (much to his chagrin) it was issued in this unfinished form.|$|E
50|$|Several {{academic}} {{scholars have}} critiqued ICTs in development.

2500|$|Medieval {{culture was}} widely admired as <b>an</b> <b>antidote</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> modern {{enlightenment}} and industrial age. [...] Plays and theatrical works (such as Ivanhoe, which in 1820 {{was playing in}} six different productions in London alone) perpetuated the romanticism of knights, castles, feasts and tournaments. Caspar David Friedrich (1774–1840) of Germany painted magnificent Gothic ruins and spiritual allegories. Jane Austen (1775–1815) wrote her novel Northanger Abbey (written 1798, published 1817) as a satire on romantic affectation.|$|E
2500|$|John Russo, Oakland City Attorney, {{argued in}} the Oakland Tribune on 24 July 2006 that [...] "Instant runoff voting is <b>an</b> <b>antidote</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> disease of {{negative}} campaigning. IRV led to San Francisco candidates campaigning more cooperatively. Under the method, their candidates {{were less likely}} to engage in negative campaigning because such tactics would risk alienating the voters who support 'attacked' candidates", reducing the chance that they would support the attacker as a second or third choice.|$|E

2500|$|As for Robert Southey, Byron satirised Southey's poem [...] "A Vision of Judgment"— which {{celebrates the}} late King George III's ascent to heaven—with his own The Vision of Judgment. Although Hazlitt {{says he does}} not much care for Byron's satires (criticising {{especially}} the heavy-handedness of the early English Bards and Scotch Reviewers), he grants that [...] "the extravagance and license of [...] seems <b>a</b> proper <b>antidote</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bigotry and narrowness of" [...] Southey's.|$|R

2500|$|Feminism {{is another}} theme that has {{received}} notice. [...] Charlize Theron is a [...] "dramatic center for the film."

Another indicator of the feminist theme is [...] "in the end, the movie...sets up {{the start of a}} matriarchal society as <b>an</b> <b>antidote</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> barbarian, warlike tribes that came before".

2500|$|Following the {{expansion}} of Center for Council’s work with inmates, the California Office of the Inspector General released a special report on High Desert State Prison in December 2015 that recommends implementing a Council-based Wellness and Resiliency Skills Training program for correctional officers as <b>an</b> <b>antidote</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> “entrenched culture” of racism and violence there.
