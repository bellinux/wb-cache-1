40|$|<b>Anode</b> power {{deposition}} is {{the principal}} performance limiter of magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters. Current thrusters lose between 50 and 70 percent of the input power to the <b>anode.</b> In this work, <b>anode</b> power deposition was studied for three cylindrical applied magnetic field thrusters {{for a range of}} argon propellant flow rates, discharge currents, and applied-field strengths. Between 60 and 95 percent of the <b>anode</b> power depositions resulted from electron current conduction into the <b>anode,</b> with cathode radiation depositing between 5 and 35 percent of the <b>anode</b> power, and convective heat transfer from the hot plasma accounting for less than 5 percent. While the fractional <b>anode</b> power loss decreased with increasing applied-field strength and <b>anode</b> size, the magnitude of the <b>anode</b> power increased. The rise in <b>anode</b> power resulted from a linear rise in the <b>anode</b> fall voltage with applied-field strength and <b>anode</b> radius. The <b>anode</b> fall voltage also rose with decreasing propellant flow rate. The trends indicate that the <b>anode</b> fall region is magnetized, and suggest techniques for reducing the <b>anode</b> power loss in MPD thrusters...|$|R

40|$|Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) are a {{promising}} {{technology in the}} power-generation sector because {{of their ability to}} use either hydrocarbons or pure hydrogen. However, introducing hydrocarbons to SOFCs has the negative effect of poisoning the <b>anode</b> of the SOFC with carbon molecules. These carbon deposits in the <b>anode</b> place mechanical stress on the <b>anode</b> and crack the <b>anode</b> interrupting the nickel-based electron percolation network. Gradual interruption of this network increases <b>anode</b> electrical resistance and can eventually lead to complete SOFC functional failure.

For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting <b>anodes</b> made from zinc to the pipe. Zinc acts as the anode (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline. Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water. A zinc disc attached to a ship's iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact. Similarly, a zinc plug attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides temporary protection.|$|E

40|$|<b>Anode</b> power {{deposition}} is {{a dominant}} power loss mechanism for arc jets and MPD thrusters. In this study, a free burning arc experiment was operated at pressures and current densities {{similar to those}} in arc jets and MPD thrusters in an attempt to identify the physics controlling this loss mechanism. Use of a free burning arc allowed for the isolation of independent variables controlling <b>anode</b> power deposition and provided a convenient and flexible way to cover a broad range of currents, <b>anode</b> surface pressures, and applied magnetic field strengths and orientations using an argon gas. Test results showed that <b>anode</b> power deposition decreased with increasing <b>anode</b> surface pressure up to 6. 7 Pa (0. 05 torr) and then became insensitive to pressure. <b>Anode</b> power increased with increasing arc current while the electron number density near the <b>anode</b> surface increased linearity. <b>Anode</b> power also increased with increasing applied magnetic field strength due to an increasing <b>anode</b> fall voltage. Applied magnetic field orientation had an effect only at high currents and low <b>anode</b> surface pressures, where <b>anode</b> power decreased when applied field lines intercepted the <b>anode</b> surface. The results demonstrated that <b>anode</b> power deposition was dominated by the current carrying electrons and that the <b>anode</b> fall voltage was the largest contributor.

5000|$|The {{reason for}} the limited {{applicability}} of the screen-grid valve, and its rapid replacement by the RF pentode (introduced around 1930) was the peculiar <b>anode</b> characteristic (i.e. variation of <b>anode</b> current with respect to <b>anode</b> voltage) of the former type of tube.In normal applications, the <b>anode</b> voltage was about 150V, while that of the screen-grid was about 60V (Thrower p 183). [...] As the screen grid is positive {{with respect to the}} cathode, it collects a certain fraction (perhaps a quarter) of the electrons which would otherwise pass from the grid region to the <b>anode.</b> This causes current to flow in the screen grid circuit. Usually, the screen current due to this cause is small, and of little interest. However, if the <b>anode</b> voltage should be below that of the screen, the screen grid can also collect secondary electrons ejected from the <b>anode</b> by the impact of the energetic primary electrons. Both effects tend to reduce the <b>anode</b> current. If the <b>anode</b> voltage is increased from a low value, with the screen grid at its normal operating voltage (60V, say) the <b>anode</b> current initially increases rapidly because more of those electrons which pass through the screen-grid are collected by the <b>anode</b> rather than passing back to the screen grid. This part of the tetrode <b>anode</b> characteristic resembles the corresponding part of that of a triode or pentode. However, when the <b>anode</b> voltage is increased further, the electrons arriving at the <b>anode</b> have sufficient energy to cause copious secondary emission, and many of these secondary electrons will be captured by the screen, which is at a higher positive voltage than the <b>anode.</b> This causes the <b>anode</b> current to fall rather than increase when the <b>anode</b> voltage is increased. In some cases the <b>anode</b> current can actually become negative (current flows out of the anode); this is possible since each primary electron may produce more than one secondary. Falling positive <b>anode</b> current accompanied by rising <b>anode</b> voltage gives the <b>anode</b> characteristic a region of negative slope, and this corresponds to a negative resistance which can cause instability in certain circuits. In a higher range of <b>anode</b> voltage, the <b>anode</b> voltage sufficiently exceeds that of the screen for an increasing proportion of the secondary electrons to be attracted back to the <b>anode,</b> so the <b>anode</b> current increases once more, and the slope of the <b>anode</b> characteristic becomes positive again. In a yet higher range of <b>anode</b> voltages, the <b>anode</b> current becomes substantially constant, since all of the secondary electrons now return to the <b>anode,</b> and the main control of current through the tube is the voltage of the control grid. This is the normal operating mode of the tube.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This {{review is}} {{concerned}} with energy transport in current-carrying, thermal plasinas, in particular with energy transport close to and at the <b>anode</b> surface of high intensity arcs. Experimental studies of the <b>anode</b> region of such arcs at atmospheric pressure reveal two types of <b>anode</b> arc roots which strongly affect the heat flux distribution. In relatively short arcs {{the action of the}} cathode jet leads to a diffuse <b>anode</b> attachment (cathode jet dominated mode). In contrast, simulations of long arcs clearly demonstrate a more or less severe constriction of the current path in front of the <b>anode</b> inducing an <b>anode</b> jet (<b>anode</b> jet dominated mode). Modeling of the <b>anode</b> region under identical conditions confirms that the "natural " arc attachment in this situation will always be constricted, resulting in extremely high specific heat fluxes at the <b>anode.</b> The analysis also shows that enthalpy transport by the electrons is the dominating heat transfer mechanism in the ano. de region. An analysis of the <b>anode</b> boundary layer of high current atmospheric pressure arcs indicates that presently available <b>anode</b> fall theories are not adequate for describing this zone. A one-dimensional analysis of the nearanode zone predicts negative <b>anode</b> falls in the range from one to three volts depending on the <b>anode</b> current density and on the plasma temperature. The electron temperature is substantially elevated over the temperature of the heavy particles close to the <b>anode.</b> Because of negative <b>anode</b> falls, the <b>anode</b> heat transfer model will no longer contain a term due to the <b>anode</b> fall. It is felt that this finding will be of great practical significance for the prediction of <b>anode</b> heat transfer in arc furnaces and in other applications which employ transferred arcs.
