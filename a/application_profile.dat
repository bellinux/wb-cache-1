It {{provides}} a low-cost alternative to adding another dedicated security core to an SoC, by providing two virtual processors backed by hardware based access control. This lets the application core switch between two states, {{referred to as}} worlds (to reduce confusion with other names for capability domains), {{in order to prevent}} information from leaking from the more trusted world to the less trusted world. This world switch is generally orthogonal to all other capabilities of the processor, thus each world can operate independently of the other while using the same core. Memory and peripherals are then made aware of the operating world of the core and may use this to provide access control to secrets and code on the device.|$|E

We examine these issues in the context of the evolving Semantic Web and the DCMI commitment to RDF and the challenges presented. We frame the discussion in terms of select functions to be served by <b>application</b> <b>profiles</b> and our notion of data profiles. While much remains to be done to address these issues, positive movement toward solutions is dependent on the appropriate framing of those issues in terms of the needs of large-scale applications such as metadata aggregators...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{technical}} problems of compatibility, of {{exchange of data}} and of interconnection between services, tools and LMSs has increased with the multiplication of software applications, platforms, and e-learning formats. Standards, specifications and formalisms {{have been developed to}} obtain interoperability. However, in practice, it is necessary to maintain some flexibility in order to answer specific needs. This is why e-learning actors need tools that could help them adapt standards to their context of use. In this paper, we describe a formalism to define and generate specific <b>application</b> <b>profiles</b> based on standards. Its goals are to provide a means to describe what differs from the standard (change in vocabulary, new element, others changes), to make the interface generation easier and to harmonize and structure <b>application</b> <b>profiles.</b> We are going to present the formalism to create <b>application</b> <b>profiles...</b>|$|R
