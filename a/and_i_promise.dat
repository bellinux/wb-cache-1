500|$|Lee {{found that}} in {{contrast}} to Chinese cinema, he had to dissuade many of the actors from using a [...] "very stagy, very English tradition. Instead of just being observed {{like a human being}} and getting sympathy, they feel they have to do things, they have to carry the movie." [...] Grant in particular often had to be restrained from giving an [...] "over-the-top" [...] performance; Lee later recalled that the actor is [...] "a show stealer. You can't stop that. I let him do, I have to say, less 'star' stuff, the Hugh Grant thing... and not [...] the movie serve him, which is probably what he's used to now." [...] For the scene in which Elinor learns Edward is unmarried, Thompson found inspiration from her reaction to her father's death. Grant had been unaware that Thompson would cry through most of his speech, and the actress attempted to reassure him, [...] "'There's no other way, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>promise</b> you it'll work, and it will be funny as well as being touching.' And he said, 'Oh, all right,' and he was very good about it". Lee had one demand for the scene, that Thompson avoid the temptation to turn her head towards the camera.|$|E
500|$|Zacharias {{was born}} in Madras, India. He is descended from {{a woman of the}} Nambudiri Brahmin caste and a Christian man of the Boatman caste. His mother was from Madras (now Chennai) while his father was from Kerala. He grew up in Delhi. According to Zacharias, before her marriage, Swiss German missionaries had spoken to his Brahmin {{ancestor}} about Christianity and she had converted and had been made an outcast by her Brahmin family and community. Zacharias grew up in a nominal Anglican household, and says that he was an atheist until the age of 17 when he tried to commit suicide by swallowing poison. While in the hospital, a local Christian worker brought him a Bible and told his mother to read to him from John 14. [...] Zacharias says that it was [...] that touched him and meant to him as the defining paradigm: [...] "Because I live, you also will live." [...] He said that he thought, [...] "This may be my only hope: A new way of living. Life as defined by the Author of Life." [...] and that he committed his life to Christ praying, [...] "Jesus if You are the one who gives life as it is meant to be, I want it. Please get me out of this hospital bed well, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>promise</b> I will leave no stone unturned in my pursuit of truth." [...] In 1966 Zacharias emigrated with his family to Canada, earning his undergraduate degree from the Ontario Bible College in 1972 (now Tyndale University College & Seminary) and his M.Div. from Trinity International University. In 1990 Mr. Zacharias did a 2-3 month sabbatical at Ridley Hall in the town of Cambridge. Zacharias has multiple honorary doctoral degrees.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2010, Gaga {{disclosed}} {{that she was}} working on a new album, saying that she had written most of the songs for the proposed album. Meanwhile, producer RedOne described it as Gaga's [...] "freedom album" [...] as her manager, Troy Carter, felt her public image would begin to change after the release of Born This Way. A few months after the announcement, Gaga exclaimed that she had finished writing songs for the album: [...] "It came so quickly. I've been working on it for months, and I feel very strongly that it's finished right now. Some artists take years. I don't. I write music every day." [...] In another interview, she declared the album [...] "the anthem of [...] generation," [...] as she continued, [...] "It includes the greatest music I've ever written. I've already written the first single for the new album <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>promise</b> you, that this album is the greatest of my career." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite this, {{during the}} casting period in 1984, Taylforth auditioned {{for the role}} of Sue Osman. She was {{unsuccessful}} and that part went to Sandy Ratcliff, however, Holland and Smith asked her back to audition for another role, the part of Kathy. Smith and Holland have commented that [...] "she came into the room, bringing the whole of the 'East-end' in with her [...] In exactly half a minute she'd charmed the pants off them". She was considered perfect, apart from her age. Smith and Holland have commented in their book Inside Story that [...] " [...] was too young! They had said so from the beginning. By rights, they should not even be interviewing her. But wasn't she perfect, apart from her age? So different from any other 'Kathy' they had seen. Fresher. More down to earth. Ages were discussed and a pocket-calculator produced. If Pete Beale had been her first boyfriend, wasn't it just possible that she could have a fourteen-year-old son? Julia and Tony were trying to talk themselves into it." [...] Taylforth has commented on the audition process, [...] " [...] whipped out a calculator and kept punching in numbers. 'We're trying to work out if you could be old enough to be Ian's Mum,' they said. I said, 'I can look older. I'll put my hair up. I'll have a few late nights <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>promise</b> I'll look old enough to be Ian's Mum'." [...] According to Holland and Smith, Gillian Taylforth's [...] "freshness and earthy charm" [...] won them around and she was offered the part of Kathy.|$|E

2500|$|Amy R. Handler of Film Threat {{gave the}} film 5 (of 5) stars: [...] "Grenzfurthner's outspoken, swiftly flying little flick is the must-see indie of 2014, {{as far as}} I'm concerned. Everyone, be they intellectuals, political-types, or simply those that love great blackly comic, sensual horror, will fall {{madly in love with}} 'Die Gstettensaga: The Rise of Echsenfriedl'. See it, as soon as possible, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>promise</b> you'll never be bored at the movies again." [...] Net culture {{magazine}} Furtherfield calls it a [...] "hackploitation art house film" [...] that reimagines [...] "the makerspace as grindhouse", a [...] "retro-futuristic post-cyberpunk adventure in the tradition of cinema grotesque". Gstettensaga's [...] "fascinating cinematic pastiche {{is more than just a}} firework of rhizomatic intertextuality, a symptom of the depthlessness of postmodern aesthetics or excessive enthusiasm for experimentation in the field of form. In their infamous 1972 book Anti-Oedipus, Gilles Deleuze and FÃ©lix Guattari have identified the technique of bricolage as the characteristic mode of production under 'schizophrenic' capitalism, a facet triumphantly magnified by the filmmakers." [...] Hacker magazine [...] interprets the film as a call to class consciousness for hackers: [...] "Setting the film in the future forces hackers to confront a choice: Will we let ourselves and our ingenuity be recuperated by all-consuming market forces? Or will we come together - as is our potential - as the class that ends capitalism's conquest to secure all means of production?" [...] Pop culture theorist Stefan Tiron comments that he is [...] "overenthusiastic about Gstettensaga - because it distracts the Hollywood canon, because it is such a genre bender, a satiric H bomb, a horror movie and ex-auction house vaudeville going for the unexpected dialectical turns of current history, and leading us into the untrodden and definitely outrageous wastelands that could be populated by the likes of Surf Nazis Must Die, Escape from New York, Steel Dawn or America 3000." [...] Jason Scott Sadofsky calls it [...] "the best kind of low-budget filmmaking", it is like [...] "watching an absurdist play by Beckett, if Beckett decided to work on the Mad Max franchise." [...] V. Vale was [...] "struck by the beautiful imagery and sound, mythological plot dimensions" [...] and Richard Kadrey calls it a [...] "mad post-collapse satire of information culture and tech fetishism, in a weird sort of melding of Stalker, Network, and The Bed-Sitting Room." [...] Political scholar Sebastian Vetter interprets the satirical dimension of the plot: [...] "The old world has been reduced to ashes by the earlier beacons of hope (China stands for Maoism and Google for alternative culture). All that remains are stretches of land governed by idiocy and dialects. As Marxists, the people from Monochrom know that only the revolution can free us from capitalism. And yet the revolution is no more alive than unicorns are." [...] Film critic Bonni Rambatan says that the film [...] "forces us to think deeper about the fact that much of today's romanticized revolutions often go eerily hand in hand with the development of digital capitalism. Few films today, if any, manage to do such a feat." [...] German online magazine Telepolis praised the eclectic, multi-layered humor.The film has a fan following in the hacker and tech community.|$|E
