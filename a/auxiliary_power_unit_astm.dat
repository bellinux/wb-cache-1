40|$|In this paper, {{the control}} system for a {{catalytic}} afterburner in a diesel fuel cell <b>auxiliary</b> <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> is presented. The catalytic afterburner is used to burn the non-utilised hydrogen and other possible combustible components of the fuel cell anode off-gas. To increase the energy efficiency of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>power</b> <b>unit,</b> the thermal energy released in the catalytic afterburner is utilised to generate the steam for the fuel processor. For optimal operation of the <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> in all modes of operation including load change, stable steam generation is required and overall energy balance must be kept within design range. To achieve this, the reaction temperature of the catalytic afterburner must be stable in all modes of operation. Therefore, we propose the afterburner temperature control based on mass and thermal balances. Finally, we demonstrate {{the control system}} using the existing prototype of the diesel fuel cell <b>auxiliary</b> <b>power</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|R
