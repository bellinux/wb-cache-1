In the second stage, the mixture of epoxy and organoclay was cured with microwave of 400 W and postcured at 135 ˚C. The microstructure of the nanocomposites was characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results indicated that the basal spacing of the organoclay particles in the epoxy/clay mixture was significantly enlarged, up to around 75 Å afther the ultrasonic treatment.

The comparison between a series of mathematical models and experimental data of flexural moduli indicates the applicabilities of Paul model for alumina and zinc oxide reinforcements, and Kerner model and Ishai Cohen model for nanoclays.

A processing procedure, the so called ‘predispersing’ process of the organo-MMT was introduced prior to melt compounding process of both constituents {{in order to facilitate}} the nanofiller dispersion in the EVA matrix. Water and toluene were used as pre-dispersing medium, while magnetic <b>stirring</b> <b>and</b> <b>ultrasonication</b> were utilized as pre-dispersing method. The effects of pre-dispersing medium and method on thermal behaviour of neat EVA and EVA nanocomposites were analysed. It was anticipated that improvement in organo-MMT dispersion would enhance the matrix-nanofiller interactions, thereby the thermal properties of the resultant EVA/MMT nanocomposite. Based on thermal studies by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the organo-MMT nanofiller pre-dispersed by ultrasonication in water medium for 2 minutes (MMT(W) 2 m–u) resulted in most significant thermal stabilizing effect to the EVA copolymer. This was due to the significant improvement in the organo-MMT dispersion when the above mentioned pre-dispersing parameters were employed.

Among them, {{the use of}} CNTs as filler for polymers {{is one of the}} most promising. In this work we report on Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composites with different weight percentages (0. 0 % to 3. 0 %) of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) having diameter 10 - 30 nm and length 20 - 30 μm. To achieve optimum dispersion of CNTs in PDMS matrix, high speed mechanical <b>stirring</b> <b>and</b> <b>ultrasonication</b> were performed. By using the doctor blade technique, 70 μm thick uniform films were produced on glass. They were subsequently thermally cured and detached from the glass to get flexible and self standing films. The surface morphological study done by FESEM, shows that CNTs are well dispersed in the PDMS. Raman spectroscopy and FTIR were used to investigate the possible structural changes in the polymer composite. To examine the optical behavior UV-VIS spectroscopy was employed in both specular and diffused modes. A linear increase in absorption coefficient is found with the increasing percentage of CNTs while the transmittance decreases exponentially. The results confirm the dependence of optical limiting effect on the quantity of MWCNTs. Based on optical study, MWCNTs/PDMS composite films can be a promising material to extend performances of optical limiters against laser pulses, which is often required in lasing system...|$|R

Stirring for 7  days resulted in no toxicity up to the highest test concentration, but EC 20 values could be calculated for the other treatments although {{there seemed to be}} no clear relationship between the method used and the resulting toxicity (see Table 2). Indeed, there were two pairs of tests in which identical conditions were applied in different experiments. The results indicate that variability between experiments was more pronounced than the variability between the different treatments: 1  min <b>stirring</b> <b>and</b> 15  min <b>ultrasonication</b> gave EC 20 values of 16.1  mg/L and 27.2  mg/L in experiments A and B, whereas 1  min <b>stirring</b> <b>and</b> 3  min <b>ultrasonication</b> gave EC 20 values of 25.5  mg/L and 8.9  mg/L in Experiments B and C.

The carboxylic peak of MWCNTs treated with KMnO 4 (FCNTK) showed higher intensity as compared to acid-treated MWCNTs (FCNTA). These results are supported with the shift of O 1 s binding energy at 534. 9 eV and shoulder of C 1 s at 289. 00 eV corresponding to carboxylic groups from XPS analysis. The immobilization of tyrosinase onto FCNTA is higher than FCNTK with high catalytic activity for phenol degradation. Further sorption study showed that FCNTA with immobilized tyrosinase (FCNTA-Ty) has higher sorption towards phenol as compared to FCNTA and pristine MWCNTs. The results illustrated that FCNTA-Ty, FCNTAs and MWCNTs had relatively well adsorption capacity for phenol as described by both Langmuir and Freundlich models.

30|$|The extreme {{condition}} {{is that both}} metal flakes and nanocarbons are failed to ionize spontaneously. Different charged surfactants should be applied to modify metal powders and nanocarbons with different charge characters. Cu, with positive standard reduction potential (+ 0.337  V), has no ability to ionize in aqueous solutions, and SDBS-treated SWCNT can be barely adsorbed on its surface (Fig.  3 f). This also indicates that the strength of van der Waals forces between nanocarbons and metal flakes are not strong enough for keeping SWCNT being absorbed on metal flakes. However, after modified by dodecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (DTAB), a kind of cationic surfactant, the surface of modified Cu flake was positively charged as revealed by the positive Zeta potential value (48.8  ±  2.6  mV) (Fig.  3 a). The DTAB solution has a high wetting ability for the Cu flakes, and therefore, DTAB particles with size of ~ 50  nm can be covered on Cu flakes after mixing Cu powders with DTAB solutions and subsequent filtering, rinsing, and drying of the modified powders. Consequently, through the electrostatic interactions between the positively charged Cu flakes and negatively charged SWCNT, uniform dispersion of SWCNT on Cu flakes can be obtained as revealed in Fig.  3 e. The above comparison also reveals that the strength of electrostatic interactions between charged nanocarbons and charged metal flakes is much stronger, as it can keep the nanocarbons attached <b>after</b> mild <b>stirring</b> <b>and</b> filtering process.|$|R

They found that the nanofluids could keep stable for 48  h with mechanical agitation without adding dispersant. Tajik et al. [86] investigated the effects of different ultrasonic types (continuous or discontinues pulses) on the suspending behavior of water-based TiO 2 nanofluids. The results showed that the continuous pulses had better breaking effects than the discontinuous ones, while the latter could not separate some big aggregations. Silambarasan et al. [66] investigated experimentally the effect of stirred bead milling <b>and</b> <b>ultrasonication</b> on the suspending behavior of water-based mixture containing submicron TiO 2 particles. They found that stirred bead milling can produce stable suspensions containing submicron particles, <b>and</b> <b>ultrasonication</b> can be further applied to control the transport behavior of the TiO 2 suspensions. Longo and Zilio [87] compared the effects of mechanical <b>stirring</b> <b>and</b> ultrasonic waves on the dispersion behavior of TiO 2 –water and Al 2 O 3 –water nanofluids. They observed that treatment of sonicating at 25  kHz for 48  h showed better dispersion efficiency than just simple mechanical <b>stirring.</b> <b>After</b> these physical dispersion treatments, the both kinds of nanofluids can keep stable for more than 1  month.|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out on the {{preparation}} and characterization of dispersions of sand in ethylene glycol-water (50 - 50 %) mixture. The dispersions were prepared by stirred bead milling of 20 - 30 µm sand (in water) followed by dilution with water and ethylene glycol. The influence of temperature (31 - 45 ºC), particle concentration (< 2 vol %) <b>and</b> <b>ultrasonication</b> on the viscosity of sand-ethylene glycol-water dispersions was studied. The thermal conductivity of dispersions {{as a function of}} particle concentration <b>and</b> <b>ultrasonication</b> has also been investigated. Correlations were developed for the prediction of relative viscosity and thermal conductivity ratio of the dispersions. Our results indicate that the sand-ethylene glycol-water dispersions, prepared by stirred bead milling <b>and</b> <b>ultrasonication,</b> have potential as coolants...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{fundamental}} {{investigations of}} various carbon-based materials {{have been conducted}} {{in search of the}} application for these materials in different fields. One of these carbon-based materials is graphite felt which is produced from polyacrylonitrile fiber and is light-weight, has a large specific surface area, is permeable to gas and liquids in all directions, chemically and thermally stable, and electrically conductive. Due to these properties, it can be used for the production of electrodes for various electrochemical devices. In order to make the graphite felt electrodes suitable for conduction of electrochemical processes, they are often additionally treated thermally and modified with functional substances by using chemical and electrochemical methods. Aim of the work - to investigate the potential of graphite felt modification with Co, Co-Ni, Ni, and Ag by electroless deposition and to evaluate the electrochemical properties of the modified graphite felt with the aim to use it in the electrochemical polysulfide and bromide/bromobromide flow energy storage devices for the more effective conduction of oxidation-reduction reactions. The modification of graphite felt with Co, Co-Ni, Ni, and Ag coatings by using the electroless (chemical) deposition method with stirring of solutions with a magnetic stirrer, ultrasound <b>stirring</b> (<b>ultrasonication),</b> <b>and</b> continuous circulation in flow-through reactor was investigated. The influence of different hydrodynamic conditions on the distribution of metals in the whole volume of the modified graphite felt was determined. The electrochemical properties of electrodes from graphite felt‘s modified with the respective metals in aqueous solutions of polysulphides and bromide/bromobromide were determined...|$|R
40|$|Polymer {{composites}} {{with carbon}} nanotubes (CNT) as filler material {{is an exciting}} research area, having a huge potential of offering better mechanical properties. One of the main challenges of using CNT as a filler material is mixing of CNTs within the matrix material, as this mixing determines {{the strength of the}} composite. Some of the methods being researched for improving mixing are chemical, mechanical and surfactants. Many studies have suggested high frequency mechanical stirring as the preferred way for better mixing, but challenges exist with finding the proper solvent which can be used for <b>stirring</b> <b>and</b> at the same time doesn 2 ̆ 7 t react with the base polymer. Furthermore, the solvent selection is limited by viscosity, evaporation rate <b>and</b> stability <b>after</b> <b>stirring.</b> Functionalization of CNT may also affect the mechanical properties of the composite as functionalization is supposed to help in distribution of CNTs in polymer matrix. For this study multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) with different functionalizations(COOH 2 ̆ 6 OH) and polydimethylsiloxane is selected as CNT polymer composite. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine an effective solvent for <b>stirring</b> <b>and</b> investigate the role of dispersion on the mechanical properties of the CNT polymer composite. Additionally the secondary objective of this study is to examine how the functionalization helps in enhancing the mechanical properties of CNT polymer composite...|$|R
50|$|There was no hard {{feelings}} and Danny returned to working with Rodney and living with Len and Pearl. He briefly dated newcomer Jo Stiles (Roxanne Pallett), but found that her lifestyle was a bit too wild for him and they remained friends. Jo helped Danny when he realized {{there was a woman}} for him right under his nose. Single mum Dawn Woods (Julia Mallam) was a close pal of Danny’s and there was a spark between them. With her evil ex Scott Windsor (Ben Freeman) in prison, Danny was free to make his move and he did. For a while, they dated happily and it looked like something more serious might come of it. Unfortunately for Danny, Scott headed back to Emmerdale and had no intention of letting Dawn be happy without him. <b>After</b> much <b>stirring,</b> Scott <b>and</b> Danny ended up brawling and Dawn dropped them both. Danny was back on the singles market but didn't have too bad a time of it. His cousin Toni (Kerry Stacey) arrived in the village in 2005, and became pals with newcomer Jamie Hope (Alex Carter) - Dawn's brother - and is enjoying life to the maximum.|$|R
