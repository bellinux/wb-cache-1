25|$|Dja Faunal Reserve was {{established}} as a faunal reserve in 1950. It was designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1987 under Natural Criteria ix and x, {{on account of the}} diversity of species present in the reserve. The Dja River surrounds the reserve on most of its border, except in the northeast. In 1981 it was designated a biosphere reserve under the UNESCO Man & Biosphere Programme covering an area of 526,000 ha. It has a topography with elevation varying between 400 m and 800 m with climate of equatorial type and with average annual precipitation of about 1,570mm. It has dense rain forests and is integral part of the Congo Basin. It is reported as the largest and best-protected of rainforests in Africa with 90 percent preserved in pristine condition mostly due to its difficult accessibility. There are more than 1,500 known plant (canopy of 30-40m rising to 60m) species in the reserve, over 107 mammals including five threatened species and more than 320 bird species in the reserve. The forest canopy consists of 43 tree species. It is well known for its biodiversity and a wide variety of primates such as western lowland gorilla Gorilla gorilla (CR) and western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) with total reported species of more than 4000. As an Important Bird Area recognised by the BirdLife International, the 1993 inventory records avifauna of 349 resident species and also more than 80 species of regular migrants.

40|$|A {{number of}} extant and extinct archosaurs evolved an elongate, narrow rostrum. This longirostrine {{condition}} {{has been associated}} with a diet comprising a higher proportion of fish and smaller prey items compared to taxa with broader, more robust snouts. The evolution of longirostrine morphology and a bulbous anterior rosette of premaxillary teeth also occurs in the spinosaurid theropod dinosaurs, leading to suggestions that at least some members of this clade also had a diet comprising a notable proportion of fish or other small vertebrates. Here we compare the rostral biomechanics of the spinosaurs Baryonyx walkeri and Spinosaurus c. f. S. aegyptiacus to three extant crocodilians: two longistrine taxa, the <b>African</b> <b>slender-snouted</b> <b>crocodile</b> Mecistops cataphractus and the Indian gharial Gavialis gangeticus; and the American alligator Alligator mississippiensis. Using computed tomography (CT) data, the second moments of area and moments of inertia at successive transverse slices along the rostrum were calculated for each of the species. Size-independent results tested the biomechanical benefits of material distribution within the rostra. The two spinosaur rostra were both digitally reconstructed from CT data and compared against all three crocodilians. Results show that <b>African</b> <b>slender-snouted</b> <b>crocodile</b> skulls are more resistant to bending than an equivalent sized gharial. The alligator has the highest resistances to bending and torsion of the crocodiles for its size and greater than that of the spinosaurs. The spinosaur rostra possess similar resistance to bending and torsion despite their different morphologies. When size is accounted for, B. walkeri performs mechanicall...|$|E

50|$|This {{species is}} {{relatively}} poorly known with few {{studies of the}} wild populations. Consequently, it was rated as Data Deficient by the IUCN in 1996. Following a review in 2014, it was moved to Critically Endangered. It {{appears to have been}} entirely extirpated from several countries where formerly present and declined elsewhere. Although threatened overall, relatively robust populations remain in parts of Central Africa, especially Gabon. In contrast, it is extremely rare in West Africa where on the verge of disappearing. Threats include hunting (skin and bushmeat), habitat loss, overfishing (it mainly feeds on fish) and general disturbance (it is very shy). There is considerable uncertainty {{about the size of the}} wild population, but it is estimated that between 1,000 and 20,000 remain. <b>Slender-snouted</b> <b>crocodiles</b> are kept and bred at a number of zoos in Europe and North America, and the Ivory Coast is considering starting a captive breeding program. A study in 2015 that included 24 captive <b>slender-snouted</b> <b>crocodiles</b> in six US zoos (more than 50% of the <b>slender-snouted</b> <b>crocodiles</b> in AZA zoos) found that all were of West African origin.|$|R

5000|$|In {{most of its}} range, the West African {{crocodile}} inhabits forested regions, but it is {{also found}} widely in more open habitats. In Mauritania it has adapted to the arid desert environment of the Sahara-Sahel by staying in caves or burrows in a state of aestivation during the driest periods, leading to the alternative common name desert crocodile. When it rains, these desert crocodiles gather at gueltas. In much of its range, the West African crocodile may come into contact with other crocodile species and {{there appears to be a}} level of habitat segregation between them. The Nile crocodile typically prefers large seasonal rivers in savannah or plains, but the West African crocodile generally prefers lagoons and wetlands in forested regions, at least where the two species may come into contact. The details of this probable segregations remains to be confirmed for certain. [...] In a study of habitat use by the three crocodile species in Liberia (West <b>African,</b> <b>slender-snouted</b> and dwarf), it was found that the West African crocodile typically occupied larger, more open waterways consisting of river basins and mangrove swamps, and was the species most tolerant of brackish waters. In comparison, the <b>slender-snouted</b> <b>crocodile</b> typically occupies rivers within forest interiors, while dwarf crocodiles are distributed in smaller rivers (mainly tributaries), streams and brooks also within forested areas.|$|R

Common species of lizard include the large Nile monitor, the agama seen around settlements, the Brook's house gecko often lives inside houses, and chamaeleos.|$|R
5000|$|The diet of the <b>slender-snouted</b> <b>crocodile</b> {{consists}} {{mainly of}} fish, amphibians and crustaceans. Adults occasionally take smaller mammals, aquatic snakes, turtles and birds. This species is not typically found in groups, except during {{the onset of}} the breeding season. The female constructs a mound nest consisting mainly of plant matter. Nests are sited on the banks of rivers, and construction generally begins at {{the onset of the}} wet season, although breeding is [...] even within members of one population. It has a similar, but generally shorter nesting season than that of the sympatric dwarf crocodile, which may nest further from the riverine habitat frequented by M. cataphractus.|$|R
