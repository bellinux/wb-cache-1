5|$|Halfway {{through his}} fifth term in Parliament, on 21 November 1959, Meisdalshagen {{suffered}} from <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> indisposition after a parliamentary speech. He was hospitalized, but died {{later that same}} day. The {{cause of death was}} intracranial hemorrhage. In Parliament he was replaced by Per Mellesmo, who advanced from deputy to regular representative. He was biographized in 1982 by Nils Oddvar Bergheim.|$|E

5|$|Horatio William Bottomley (23 March 1860– 26 May 1933) was an English financier, journalist, editor, {{newspaper}} proprietor, swindler, and Member of Parliament. He is {{best known}} for his editorship of the popular magazine John Bull, and for his patriotic oratory during the First World War. His career came to <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> end when, in 1922, he was convicted of fraud and sentenced to seven years imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|In nuclear {{applications}} where graphite {{is used as}} {{a neutron}} moderator, accumulation of Wigner energy followed by <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> spontaneous release may occur. Annealing to at least 250°C can release the energy safely, although in the Windscale fire the procedure went wrong, causing other reactor materials to combust.|$|E
5|$|So far, the {{investigation}} {{had been on}} the natural frequency of transient oscillation of a resonant circuit resulting from <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> stimulus. More important {{from the point of view}} of filter theory is the behaviour of a resonant circuit when driven by an external AC signal: there is <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> peak in the circuit's response when the driving signal frequency is at the resonant frequency of the circuit. James Clerk Maxwell heard of the phenomenon from Sir William Grove in 1868 in connection with experiments on dynamos, and was also aware of the earlier work of Henry Wilde in 1866. Maxwell explained resonance mathematically, with a set of differential equations, in much the same terms that an RLC circuit is described today.|$|E

5|$|The peak was {{originally}} settled 8,000 to 10,000 {{years ago by}} ancestors of the Latgawa Native American tribe. In the early 1850s, <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> influx of non-indigenous settlers resulted in the Rogue River Wars. After the wars, the Latgawa were forced away from the region onto reservations. The peak was named in the late 1850s after one of its first landowners, Roxy Ann Bowen.|$|E

5|$|These {{ideas were}} {{informed}} by events {{prior to the}} Great Depression when – {{in the opinion of}} Keynes and others – international lending, primarily by the U.S., exceeded the capacity of sound investment and so got diverted into non-productive and speculative uses, which in turn invited default and <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> stop to the process of lending.|$|E

5|$|A further, albeit rare, {{complication}} of CSF leak is transient quadriplegia due to <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> and significant loss of CSF.

An extremely rare {{complication of}} SCSFLS is third nerve palsy, where {{the ability to move}} one's eyes becomes difficult and interrupted due to compression of the third cranial nerve.|$|E

5|$|Causes include falls, vehicle collisions, and violence. Brain trauma {{occurs as}} a {{consequence}} of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> acceleration or deceleration within the cranium or by a complex combination of both movement and sudden impact. In addition to the damage caused at the moment of injury, a variety of events in the minutes to days following the injury may result in secondary injury. These processes include alterations in cerebral blood flow and the pressure within the skull. Some of the imaging techniques used for diagnosis include computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs).|$|E

Throughout the United States, Charley caused 10deaths and $15.4billion in damage to insured residential property, making it the second costliest hurricane in United States history at the time (it has since dropped to ninth). Charley was a compact, fast-moving storm, which limited the scope and severity of the damage.|$|E
