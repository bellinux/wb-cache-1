50|$|According to the 2006 Census report, the Thai working {{force in}} Hong Kong forms about 7,414 people {{out the whole}} Thai {{population}} of 11,900 in Hong Kong. 71.9% of the working force consists of domestic helpers, whose median income is $4,000. However, Thai domestic helpers are being replaced by Indonesian workers because the latter’s demand of wages is lower and their ability of speaking Cantonese is higher. Losing those two advantages, except for those Thai domestic helpers who can speak Cantonese, the Thai domestic helpers cannot occupy the mainstream market in Hong Kong. The minimum wage for domestic helpers in Hong Kong is HKD3,270 , adjusted downwards from HKD3,670; an <b>additional</b> <b>levy</b> on the salary {{is supposed to be}} paid by the employer, but the Thai Ministry of Labour reported in 2005 that employers often forced the employee to pay this levy instead.|$|E

50|$|In Australia {{the current}} system, known as Medicare, was instituted in 1984. It coexists {{with a private}} health system. All legal {{permanent}} residents are entitled to government-paid public hospital care. Treatment by private doctors is also paid by the government when the doctor direct bills the Health Department (Bulk Billing). Medicare is funded partly by a 1.5% income tax levy (with exceptions for low-income earners), but mostly out of general revenue. An <b>additional</b> <b>levy</b> of 1% is imposed on high-income earners without private health insurance. There is a means tested 30% subsidy on private health insurance. As well as Medicare, there is a separate Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme under which listing and a government subsidy is dependent on expert evaluation of the comparative cost-effectiveness of new pharmaceuticals. In 2005, Australia spent 8.8% of GDP on health care, or US$3,181 per capita. Of that, approximately 67% was government expenditure.|$|E
50|$|CJSW {{finances}} {{its capital}} budget through a week-long funding drive held every October. Raising $13,585 {{in its first}} effort in 1985 and approximately $21,000 the following year, the totals brought in from this appeal to the community listenership have steadily increased annually. In March 1987 a second referendum, asking for a $1 per term per student increase in the station's levy, was voted upon by the University's students. In an extremely contentious decision involving partisan behaviour by the vote's chief returning officer, the <b>additional</b> <b>levy</b> was won—by one vote. Since 2001, funding drive pledge totals have been consistently above $150,000. In 2006, the station reached and surpassed its goal of $200,000 (a feat repeated in subsequent years) and exceeded $240,000 in 2014. This extraordinary success has made CJSW {{a model for other}} campus and community broadcasters across the country, and the station shares its experience and knowledge with those peers wishing to solidify their finances and public profile.|$|E
5000|$|For example, one way {{to avoid}} the lake getting more and more {{polluted}} might be through setting up an <b>additional</b> <b>levy</b> on the industrial plant based on measured concentrations of its effluent. Say the plant management has to pay into a water management fund, on a weekly or monthly basis, depending on the actual amount of waste found in the lake; they will, in this case, receive a direct benefit not just from reducing their waste output, but actually reducing it enough to achieve the desired effect of reducing concentrations in the lake. They cannot benefit from [...] "doing damage more slowly" [...] -- only from actually helping. If cutting emissions, even to zero, is insufficient to allow the lake to naturally purge the waste, then they will still be on the hook for cleanup.

In 1275, the [...] "Great and Ancient Custom" [...] began to tax woollen products and hides, with the Great Charter of 1303 imposing <b>additional</b> <b>levies</b> on foreign merchants in England, with the poundage tax introduced in 1347.

50|$|The dock was 'improved' in 1805 {{and then}} in 1837 an Act of Parliament allowed the Ipswich Dock Commissioners to {{construct}} a new wet dock whilst also placing certain conditions on them.

The Ipswich Dock Commission was provided with investment of £25,000 and the right to borrow a further £100,000 but needed a further loan of £20,000 and also an <b>additional</b> <b>levy</b> of six pence per tonne on all imported coal to fund the project.

5000|$|Many systems {{allow for}} fiscal {{transparency}} of {{certain forms of}} enterprise. For example, most countries tax partners of a partnership, rather than the partnership itself, on income of the partnership. [...] A common feature of income taxation is imposition of a levy on certain enterprises in certain forms followed by an <b>additional</b> <b>levy</b> on owners of the enterprise upon distribution of such income. For example, the U.S. imposes two levels of tax on foreign individuals or foreign corporations who own a U.S. corporation. First, the U.S. corporation {{is subject to the}} regular income tax on its profits, then subject to an additional 30% tax on the dividends paid to foreign shareholders (the branch profits tax). The foreign corporation will be subject to U.S. income tax on its effectively connected income, and will also be subject to the branch profits tax on any of its profits not reinvested in the U.S. Thus, many countries tax corporations under company tax rules and tax individual shareholders upon corporate distributions. Various countries have tried (and some still maintain) attempts at partial or full [...] "integration" [...] of the enterprise and owner taxation. Where a two level system is present but allows for fiscal transparency of some entities, definitional issues become very important.|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} the 1540s, the {{increase}} in the cultivation of currants in Zakynthos and Cephalonia attracted the attention of the local Rettore. Even by 1533, there are reports of direct trade in currants between the Ionian Islands and England without the trade being routed via Venice and so avoiding duties. In response, Venice tried to stop the proliferation of currant plantations as they were deemed potentially dangerous for Zakynthos's grain production. The situation had become so dire for Venice that by the early 1580s it is reported that Zakynthos had gone from being self-sufficient in grain to having only 3 months of supplies for local consumption and relying on imports from Ottoman territories. Venice recognised this was not viable in case of war with the Ottoman Empire. However, the farmers and merchants of Zakynthos continued to cultivate more currants - it was reported a field of currants yielded up to 60 ducats of profit, whilst a field of grain yielded around 6.One of the primary reasons currants became so much more profitable than grain was the increasing demand from the English market and the emerging relationship with English merchants in evading customs duties. In 1545, for the first time, there was some alarm regarding customs evasion, as the local authorities on Zakynthos were concerned that foreign merchants, later identified as English, were exporting out of Zakynthos and Cephalonia with the support of local inhabitants. In 1580, the returning Rettori from Zakynthos and Cephalonia - Gabriele Emo and Alvise Lando - highlighted the increased English presence in the islands. Emo and Lando recommended that an <b>additional</b> <b>levy</b> be raised to offset their encroachment on local trade.|$|E
