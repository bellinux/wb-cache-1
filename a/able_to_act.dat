5|$|Chapman took up pipe smoking aged 15, which {{continued}} {{for the remainder}} of his life. He began drinking heavily during his time at Cambridge and St Bartholomew's, favouring gin. By the time Monty Python went on tour in 1973, Chapman's drinking had begun to affect his performance, causing him to miss cues to go on stage. He stopped drinking in Christmas 1977, concerned at being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> in Life of Brian successfully, and remained sober {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Polyphenols, {{which often}} have {{antioxidant}} properties in vitro, {{are not necessarily}} antioxidants in vivo due to extensive metabolism. In many polyphenols, the catechol group acts as electron acceptor and is therefore responsible for the antioxidant activity. However, this catechol group undergoes extensive metabolism upon uptake in the human body, for example by catechol-O-methyl transferase, and is therefore no longer <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as electron acceptor. Many polyphenols may have non-antioxidant roles in minute concentrations that affect cell-to-cell signaling, receptor sensitivity, inflammatory enzyme activity or gene regulation.|$|E
5|$|Sejm deputies doing {{legislative}} {{work were}} generally not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as they pleased. Regional szlachta assemblies, the sejmiks, were summoned before sessions of general sejm; there the local nobility provided their representatives with copious {{instructions on how}} to proceed and protect the interests of the area involved. Another sejmik was called after the Sejm's conclusion. At that time the deputies would report to their constituency on what had been accomplished.|$|E

5|$|During the Siege of Petersburg, Alexander had {{to adapt}} his {{artillery}} tactics to trench warfare, including experimentation with {{various types of}} mortars. He became convinced that the Union forces were attempting to tunnel under the Confederate lines, but before he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> on this, on June 30, 1864, he {{was wounded in the}} shoulder by a sharpshooter. As he departed on medical leave to Georgia, he informed Lee of his suspicion. After unsuccessful attempts were made to locate the tunneling activity, the Battle of the Crater caught the Confederates by surprise, although it ended in a significant Union defeat. Alexander returned to the Army in February 1865 and supervised the defenses of Richmond along the James River. He retreated along with Lee's army in the Appomattox Campaign.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rebel}} capture of Brussels on 18 December, work soon began {{on a new}} constitution. In January, the rebels re-called the States-General, a {{traditional}} assembly composed of the provincial elites which had not met since the Middle Ages, to discuss the form the new state would take. Its 53 members, representing the states and social classes, met in Brussels in January 1790 to begin negotiations. The constitution eventually devised by the States-General was inspired by both the Dutch Verlatinge of 1581 and American Declaration of Independence of 1776. The liberals were disgusted that members of society from beyond the guilds, clergy and nobility should not be consulted. They also saw the closed sessions of the States-General as ridiculing the idea of popular sovereignty. The declaration of the independence was not supported by Britain and the Dutch who believed that the new independent state would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as an effective buffer against possible French territorial expansion in the region.|$|E
5|$|Despite the bad {{feelings}} generated at Damietta, Amalric still refused {{to abandon his}} dream of conquering Egypt, and he continued to seek {{good relations with the}} Byzantines in the hopes of another joined attack, which never took place. In 1171 Amalric came to Constantinople in person, after Egypt had fallen to Saladin. Manuel was thus able to organise a grand ceremonial reception which both honoured Amalric and underlined his dependence: for the rest of Amalric's reign, Jerusalem was a Byzantine satellite, and Manuel was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as a protector of the Holy Places, exerting a growing influence in the Kingdom of Jerusalem.* H. E. Mayer, The Latin East, 657 In 1177, a fleet of 150 ships was sent by Manuel I to invade Egypt, but returned home after appearing off Acre due to the refusal of Count Philip of Flanders and many important nobles of the Kingdom of Jerusalem to help.|$|E

50|$|Among {{the newer}} {{experimental}} treatments {{is the study}} of glucocorticoid antagonists, including mifepristone. These strategies may treat the underlying pathophysiology of psychotic depression by correcting an overactive HPA axis. By competitively blocking certain neuro-receptors, these medications render cortisol less <b>able</b> <b>to</b> directly <b>act</b> on the brain.|$|R

5|$|Before leaving England in 1189, Richard put the Tower of London in Longchamp's {{hands and}} {{appointed}} him jointly with Hugh de Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, {{to the office}} of Chief Justiciar, at that time not strictly a judicial office. Instead, the justiciar was the person entrusted with much of the king's authority when the king was outside the kingdom, <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> in the king's name. Along with Puiset, the king named Hugh Bardulf, William Briwerre, Geoffrey fitz Peter, and William Marshall as associates in the justiciarship, under Puiset and Longchamp. As Justiciar, Longchamp sent judges throughout the country to visit the shires on judicial visits, even though he had no previous knowledge of the judiciary. Longchamp and Puiset were unable to work together, and so in March 1190 Richard gave authority north of the River Humber to Hugh, and authority south of the river to Longchamp. Historian's opinions are divided whether Richard explicitly made Longchamp superior to Puiset at this time, or if in theory the two were supposed to co-equal in their respective spheres. By June, Longchamp had eased Puiset out of power and the justiciar's office. He also received a commission as a papal legate from Pope Clement III at this time. Supposedly Richard paid 1,500marks (Â£1,000) to the papacy to secure the legateship for Longchamp.|$|E

3000|$|..., {{in which}} the optimal policy converges in 100 steps, while an agent with policy {{uncertainty}} would not converge at all in most realizations. Although (Ortega and Braun [2010 b]) prove asymptotic convergence for general environments fulfilling a restrictive form of ergodicity condition, this condition needs to be weakened for the convergence proof to be applicable to most real problems. But {{it is clear that}} a form of ergodicity is required for an agent with policy uncertainty <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> learn <b>to</b> <b>act</b> optimally. Intuitively, this means that an agent can only learn if the environment has temporally stable statistical properties.|$|R

RFB entered into a joint venture with Grumman American to develop the Fanliner, allowing the use of components from existing Grumman American light planes.|$|E
25|$|Milton's view of monarchy and the {{decadence}} of monarchy is a theme later emphasised in Paradise Lost. Within this epic, Satan {{is directly}} linked to monarchical rule, whereas the pre-fallen Adam is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> without the pomp of the court. Instead, Milton promotes a republican form of government and believes {{that it is impossible}} for a government run by an individual to ever work even if the individual was completely virtuous. He also believed that a true republican would not accept a monarchical form of government.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} logic which {{allows us to}} reason about acting, and more {{specifically}} about sensing, i. e. actions that acquire information from the real world, and planning, i. e. actions that generate and execute plans of actions. This logic {{takes into account the}} fact that, as it happens in real systems, actions may fail, and provides the ability of reasoning about failure handling in acting, sensing and planning. We see this work as a first step towards a formal account of systems which are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> plan <b>to</b> <b>act,</b> plan <b>to</b> sense and plan to plan, and therefore, to integrate action, perception and reasoning. ...|$|R

The second generation iPod Shuffle was also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as a flash drive, just like the first generation iPod Shuffle. However, unlike the first generation iPod Shuffle, {{the second generation}} {{did not have a}} built-in USB connector.

The FBI and Justice Department refused to provide preventive guards for buses traveling through the South to reach D.C. William Johnson recruited more than 1,000 police officers to serve on this force. Julius Hobson, an FBI informant who served on the March's security force, told the team {{to be on the lookout}} for FBI infiltrators who might act as agents provocateurs.|$|E
25|$|On March 19, 1944 German troops {{occupied}} Hungary, {{prime minister}} MiklÃ³s KÃ¡llay was deposed and soon mass deportations of Jews to German death camps in occupied Poland began. SS-ObersturmbannfÃ¼hrer Adolf Eichmann went to Hungary {{to oversee the}} large-scale deportations. Between 15 May and 9 July, Hungarian authorities deported 437,402 Jews. All but 15,000 of these Jews were sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau, and 90% of those were immediately killed. One in three of all Jews killed at Auschwitz were Hungarian citizens. Sztojay, unlike previous prime ministers, answered mostly to Berlin and was thus <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> independently of Horthy. However, reports of the conditions in the concentration camps led the admiral to resist his policies.|$|E
5000|$|Rape {{trees are}} trees or bushes that mark where sexual assaults have {{occurred}} by arranging the victim's undergarments on {{or around the}} trees branches or on the ground.

25|$|The World Jewish Congress was {{established}} in Geneva, Switzerland in August, 1936, {{in reaction to the}} rise of Nazism and the growing wave of European anti-Semitism. Since its foundation, it has been a permanent body with offices around the world. The main aims of the organization were âto mobilize the Jewish people and the democratic forces against the Nazi onslaughtâ, to âfight for equal political and economic rights everywhere, and particularly for the Jewish minorities in Central and Eastern Europeâ, to support the establishment of a âJewish National Home in Palestineâ and to create âa worldwide Jewish representative body based on the concept of the unity of the Jewish people, democratically organized and <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> on matters of common concernâ.|$|E

With exception of some elevated points occupied by Parma's forces the whole country was overflowed. The Spanish army comprised almost 20,000 men and Morgan ordered sallies to be made against the besieging Spanish force whilst trenches and ravelins were built. Several were made from September 23 with success and forced the Spanish to flee from their entrenchments having lost a great deal of supplies, prisoners and equipment. During one of the sallies a young Francis Vere received a wound from a pike to this leg.|$|E
25|$|During childhood, {{siblings}} are {{a source}} of conflict and frustration as well as a support system. Adolescence may affect this relationship differently, depending on sibling gender. In same-sex sibling pairs, intimacy increases during early adolescence, then remains stable. Mixed-sex siblings pairs act differently; siblings drift apart during early adolescent years, but experience an increase in intimacy starting at middle adolescence. Sibling interactions are children's first relational experiences, the ones that shape their social and self-understanding for life. Sustaining positive sibling relations can assist adolescents in a number of ways. Siblings are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as peers, and may increase one another's sociability and feelings of self-worth. Older siblings can give guidance to younger siblings, although the impact of this can be either positive or negative depending on the activity of the older sibling.|$|E
