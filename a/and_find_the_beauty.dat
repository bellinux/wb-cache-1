50|$|In the {{contemporary}} era San Menaio saw his popularity rapidly increased, {{especially in the}} 1960s and 1970s, becoming a place of elegant and exclusive resort and holidays, and passing, unfortunately not without exceptions, trough innumerable attempts development abuses that have undermined the sobriety of urban plan, which consists mainly of villas with gardens blend perfectly in the orography of the coast.In those years Italian artist Andrea Pazienza stays here <b>and</b> <b>finds</b> inspiration from <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> of this places.

50|$|Signal {{deals with}} ephemeral and spiritual themes. Furukawa says, “each song is a {{different}} type of ceremonial goodbye song. I lost my Japanese grandmother while I was working on this album, and went through some enormous life transitions with relationships and work and travel. Like the snow falling gracefully to make everything perfect for a day, many things in our lives are transitory. I guess this album was really coming to grips with that <b>and</b> trying to <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> <b>and</b> meaning in it.” Furukawa has also composed a bilingual children’s album, “The Adventures of Chibi Neko Chan.” A limited release of some of the songs have been used for charity programs. It will officially be released through her website in the future.|$|R

60|$|With a crate, or jack, made of iron hoops, {{to contain}} your fire, and {{attached}} to the bow of your boat about three feet from the water, a fish-spear with seven tines, and fourteen feet long, a large basket, or barrow, to carry your fuel and bring back your fish, and a thick outer garment, you are equipped for a cruise. It should be a warm and still evening; {{and then with a}} fire crackling merrily at the prow, you may launch forth like a cucullo into the night. The dullest soul cannot go upon such an expedition without some of the spirit of adventure; as if he had stolen the boat of Charon and gone down the Styx on a midnight expedition into the realms of Pluto. And much speculation does this wandering star afford to the musing nightwalker, leading him on and on, jack-o'lantern-like, over the meadows; or, if he is wiser, he amuses himself with imagining what of human life, far in the silent night, is flitting mothlike round its candle. The silent navigator shoves his craft gently over the water, with a smothered pride and sense of benefaction, {{as if he were the}} phosphor, or light-bringer, to these dusky realms, or some sister moon, blessing the spaces with her light. The waters, for a rod or two on either hand and several feet in depth, are lit up with more than noonday distinctness, and he enjoys the opportunity which so many have desired, for the roofs of a city are indeed raised, and he surveys the midnight economy of the fishes. There they lie in every variety of posture; some on their backs, with their white bellies uppermost, some suspended in midwater, some sculling gently along with a dreamy motion of the fins, and others quite active and wide awake,--a scene not unlike what the human city would present. Occasionally he will encounter a turtle selecting the choicest morsels, or a musk-rat resting on a tussuck. He may exercise his dexterity, if he sees fit, on the more distant and active fish, or fork the nearer into his boat, as potatoes out of a pot, or even take the sound sleepers with his hands. But these last accomplishments he will soon learn to dispense with, distinguishing the real object of his pursuit, <b>and</b> <b>find</b> compensation in <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> <b>and</b> never-ending novelty of his position. The pines growing down to the water's edge will show newly as in the glare of a conflagration; and as he floats under the willows with his light, the song-sparrow will often wake on her perch, and sing that strain at midnight, which she had meditated for the morning. And when he has done, he may have to steer his way home through the dark by the north star, and he will feel himself some degrees nearer to it for having lost his way on the earth.|$|R

40|$|A line, the {{simplest}} way to express an artist's feelings or interpretation of an object, has its own emotions that an artist can employ for her purpose. Laser light, the most self-concentrated, self-sustained and directed, has its unique characteristics that no other medium can imitate. When a line and laser light are combined, the result is a knife-cut clean laser line that catches the viewers breath. Artists, who have chosen the laser as their tool, need to make laser line images more attractive than laser light itself. In other words, artists must <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> of laser lines. Otherwise, the tool of the work dominates the artist's work itself. In this thesis, I having already chosen the laser as my tool, tried to <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> of laser lines by first learning the technical aspects and the characteristics of lasers. Then I examined previous works done by other laser artists, before working with lasers myself. I designed four laser projects in order to find "the beauty of laser lines," and the details of my works will be presented in this thesis. by Sue-Mie Kim. Thesis (M. S. V. S.)

His most popular works, such as The Kiss and The Thinker, are widely used outside the fine arts as symbols of human emotion and character.

Jade Chang, author of The Wangs vs. The World, said of Holy Land in 2016, “Waldie's meditation on suburbia <b>finds</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> in wonky detail and weaves a wholly unconventional narrative.
