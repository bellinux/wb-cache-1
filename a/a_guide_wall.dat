40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} the impact from the geometry of guide walls (GWs) on the power output of a solar chimney power plant. Numerical simulations found {{a reduction in the}} mass flow rate after adding <b>a</b> <b>guide</b> <b>wall</b> in the system. The driving force and the velocity, however, showed a significant increase along the increasing altitude of GWs. The potential maximum power output was enlarged by 29. 6 % in a cylindrical-chimney system and by 6. 3 % in a divergent-chimney system compared to the system without guide walls. Based on the results, the GW height should be a primary criterion for designing GWs...|$|E
40|$|Partial-depth, {{impermeable}} guidance structures (or guide walls) {{are used}} to enhance downstream passage effectiveness at a hydroelectric facility by actively guiding fish to a safe passage route (i. e. the bypass). Guide walls have been installed {{in a variety of}} ways and, like many fish passage devices, have resulted in variable efficiency rates. Currently, the most common type of installment is a steel panel guide wall attached to a floating boom. While less utilized than other guidance structure options (e. g. louvers and bar racks), guide walls have been gaining popularity, particularly within the Northwest United States. The aim of this dissertation is to perform a literature review on guide walls and to provide a detailed assessment on how the key design parameters of <b>a</b> <b>guide</b> <b>wall</b> impact the flow field. Chapter 1 is broken into two sections. First, a literature review is performed on guide walls, explaining the history of their use and their effectiveness. Second, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed and used to evaluate the effect of several guide wall design parameters (depth, angle, and approach flow velocity). Chapter 2 provides another analysis of the hydraulic conditions upstream of <b>a</b> <b>guide</b> <b>wall,</b> but does so using a lab-scale model. The results of Chapter 1 are compared to that of Chapter 2. Lastly, Chapter 3 performs a sensitivity analysis by evaluating the effect of the bypass flow percentage on the key metric (the ratio of the vertical velocity component to the sweeping velocity magnitude) developed in Chapter 1 2 ̆ 6 2...|$|E

Their purpose is to guide the fish to a bypass (i. e. a sluice gate, weir, or pipe) allowing the fish to circumvent the turbine intakes and safely pass downstream. This paper details a series of experiments (nine total) performed at the USGS Conte Anadromous Fish Research Center located in Turners Falls, MA {{and a series of}} computational fluid dynamics models (24 total). The goal of the analysis was to measure the velocity components (x, y, and z) immediately upstream of the <b>guide</b> <b>wall</b> under <b>a</b> wide range of <b>guide</b> <b>wall</b> depths and angles to flow for a specified flow rate typical of a power canal.

In this paper, we design a cross structured light (CSL) {{to detect the}} weld line and propose a robust laser stripe segmentation algorithm to overcome the noises in structured light images. An adaptive monochromatic space is applied to preprocess the image with ambient noises. In the monochromatic image, the laser stripe obtained is recovered as a multichannel signal by minimum entropy deconvolution. Lastly, the stripe centre points are extracted from the image. In experiments, the CSL sensor and the proposed algorithm are applied to <b>guide</b> <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> climbing robot inspecting the weld line of a wind power tower.

40|$|Downstream fish passage {{facilities}} at the Holyoke Project were modified {{to enhance the}} passage of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts. A pier extension was installed adjacent to the Holyoke Dam bascule gate, the opening of an experimental weir inserted in the bascule gate was {{moved closer to the}} Hadley Falls Station intakes, and above-water lighting was added. An intake rack overlay was in place at both Hadley Falls Station units {{during the first half of}} this evaluation; the Unit 2 overlay was removed during the second half. Radiotagged, hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon smolts were released upstream of the Project and downstream passage routes were monitored. All releases were conducted after flashboards had been installed on the crest of the dam, closing that passage route. Overall, 63 % of the radiotagged smolts that approached Hadley Falls Station passed over the bascule gate weir and 37 % passed through the turbines. These results were comparable to results obtained in a 1992 evaluation, when <b>a</b> floating <b>guide</b> <b>wall</b> was present upstream of the intakes. Two-thirds of the radiotagged smolts that passed through the turbines at Hadley Falls Station did so through Unit 1. Removal of the Unit 2 intake rack overlay did not affect the proportion of radiotagged smolts passing through the turbines. Combining data from 1992 and 1995, a statistically significant but weak negative relationship between flow through the station and the proportion of radiotagged smolts passing over the bascule gate/weir was found. The louver/bypass system in the Holyoky Canal passed 91 % of the radiotagged smolts entering the canal back to the Hadley Falls Station tailrace. Above-water lighting installed upstream of the canal gatehouse appeared to have raised the proportion of radiotagged smolts entering the canal. When the results of passage through the bascule gate weir and the louver/bypass system were combined, 74 % of the radiotagged smolts passed through downstream passage facilities. Smolts passing through the louver/bypass system or through the turbines arrived at a location downstream of the dam more quickly than smolts that had passed through the bascule gate weir...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} closed access. This paper {{describes}} various methods {{for the construction}} of trapped-mode solutions within wave guides and along diffraction gratings; in the latter case the solutions are often called Rayleigh-Bloch waves. One of the main results is the explicit construction of a number of new trapped-mode solutions within <b>a</b> wave <b>guide</b> that correspond to eigenvalues that are embedded in the continuous spectrum of the relevant operators. The method of construction is to take 'trial' solutions of the field equation that satisfy the required conditions on the <b>guide</b> <b>walls</b> and have the correct decay at large distances and then to identify lines that can be interpreted as the boundary of a structure within the wave guide. The same idea is also investigated for Rayleigh-Bloch waves within the context of diffraction gratings.

40|$|Within {{the context}} of ever wider {{expansion}} of direct injection in spark ignition engines, this investigation was aimed at improved understanding of the correlation between fuel injection strategy and emission of nanoparticles. Measurements performed on <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>guided</b> engine allowed identifying the mechanisms involved {{in the formation of}} carbonaceous structures during combustion and their evolution in the exhaust line. In-cylinder pressure was recorded in combination with cycle-resolved flame imaging, gaseous emissions and particle size distribution. This complete characterization was performed at three injection phasing settings, with butanol and commercial gasoline. Optical accessibility from below the combustion chamber allowed visualization of diffusive flames induced by fuel deposits; these localized phenomena were correlated to observed changes in engine performance and pollutant species. With gasoline fueling, minor modifications were observed with respect to combustion parameters, when varying the start of injection. The alcohol, on the other hand, featured marked sensitivity to the fuel delivery strategy. Even though the start of injection was varied in a relatively narrow crank angle range during the intake stroke, significant differences were recorded, especially in the values of particle emissions. This was correlated to the fuel jet-wall interactions; the analysis of diffusive flames, their location and size confirmed the importance of liquid film formation in direct injection engines, especially at medium and high load...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydraulic}} efficiency of water process tanks can be significantly improved by performing simple modifications {{in the initial}} geometries of the tanks. This concept was applied in the main tanks of the water supply network of Athens, which are used for disinfection. Various modified geometries were formulated by ""inserting"" <b>guiding</b> <b>walls</b> in these tanks, a very common, simple and inexpensive modification. The {{hydraulic efficiency}} of the tanks was assessed with a CFD model, which calculated the flow fields and the flow through curves (FTCs) for the initial and the modified geometries. From the comparison of the results the following conclusions were drawn: (1) the flow for the initial geometries was characterized by high levels of short-circuiting, large re-circulation regions and high degrees of mixing, and (2) the use of <b>guiding</b> <b>walls</b> created flow fields in the tanks with significant volumes of ""plug flow"", reduced short-circuiting, smaller re-circulation regions and thus less mixing. The modified geometries showing the best hydraulic efficiency were proposed for construction. This procedure, which can be applied in the all types of water tanks, resulted in significant cost savings, because the modifications were examined with the CFD model, prior to their actual implementation in the real tanks. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the existence of}} embedded trapped modes for symmetric obstacles which are placed on the centreline of a two-dimensional acoustic waveguide. Modes are sought which are antisymmetric about the centreline of the channel but which have frequencies that are above the first cut-off for antisymmetric wave propagation down the guide. In the terminology of spectral theory {{this means that the}} eigenvalue associated with the trapped mode is embedded in the continuous spectrum of the relevant operator. A numerical procedure based on a boundary integral technique is developed to search for embedded trapped modes for bodies of general shape. In addition two approximate solutions for trapped modes are found;the first is for long plates on the centreline of the channel and the second is for slender bodies which are perturbations of plates perpendicular to the <b>guide</b> <b>walls.</b> It is found that embedded trapped modes do not exist for arbitrary symmetric bodies but if an obstacle is defined by two geometrical parameters then branches of trapped modes may be obtained by varying both of these parameters simultaneously. One such branch is found for a family of ellipses of varying aspect ratio and size. The thin plates which are parallel and perpendicular to the <b>guide</b> <b>walls</b> are found to correspond to the end points of this branch...|$|R
