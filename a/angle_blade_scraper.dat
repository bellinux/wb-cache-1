40|$|Objectives: The <b>angled</b> <b>blade</b> plate {{has been}} the {{historical}} standard in fixed-angle extramedullary subtrochanteric femur fracture fixation, but it requires an extensile lateral approach to the femur. Little formal evaluation exists for specifically designed percutaneous extramedullary implants. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare 3 locked plating constructs, all with percutaneous insertion capability, with the standard 95 -degree <b>angled</b> <b>blade</b> plate to determine whether specifically designed fixed-angle extramedullary implants for subtrochanteric femur fractures were biomechanically comparable to the <b>angled</b> <b>blade</b> plate. Methods: Forty composite adult femurs were divided into 4 equal groups. The constructs evaluated included a 95 -degree <b>angled</b> <b>blade</b> plate, a broad 4. 5 -mm combination locking plate, and a precontoured proximal femoral locking plate (PFLP) with and without an oblique, angled strut or ‘‘kickstand’’screw. A 30 -degree wedge osteotomy was used to create a subtrochanteric fracture gap model. Each specimen underwent axial and torsional stiffness testing along with cyclic axial loading to failure. Results: Axial stiffness testing revealed that the PFLP with the ‘‘kickstand’’ screw was the stiffest construct (92. 2 ± 17. 4 Nm/m), which was 211...|$|R
50|$|During the 1994 {{excavations}} of mastodon B, archaeologists identified 34 {{stone tools}} {{in association with}} the disarticulated faunal remains. These tools included prismatic <b>blades,</b> <b>scrapers,</b> gravers, and resharpening flakes. Subsequent examination of the bones from mastodon B revealed the presence of cut marks on a thoracic vertebra, which was recovered in direct contact with several flakes. The distinctive, linear, v-shaped profile of the cuts and their location along the thoracic spinous process indicated they were the result of butchering, and specifically, efforts to remove dorsal muscles along the backbone.|$|R

50|$|Stone {{artefact}} scatters {{are among}} the most common site types and provide evidence of tool use and manufacture. These are often extensive surface scatters and deep stratified deposits of flaked finegrained stone, of lithic flakes. Much of this material is waste flakes, discarded during the manufacture process. Specific types of artefacts such as <b>blades,</b> <b>scrapers</b> or burins may indicate what the area was used for, for example processing animal skins. Stone artefact material is usually rine grained silcrete, chert, and quartz. Hornfels is an unusual and rare material, but is highly distinctive.|$|R
40|$|Regenerative pump {{is a low}} {{specific}} speed and rotor-dynamic turbomachine capable of developing high heads at low flow rates. In this paper, a numerical study {{has been carried out}} in order to investigate the effect of <b>blade</b> <b>angle</b> on the performance of a regenerative pump. Two groups of impellers were employed. The first type has symmetric <b>angle</b> <b>blades</b> with identical inlet/outlet angles of ± 10 °, ± 30 °, and ± 50 ° and the second group has nonsymmetric <b>angle</b> <b>blades</b> in which the inlet angle was set to 0 ° and six different angles of ± 10 °, ± 30 °, and ± 50 ° were designed for the outlet of the blades. A total of 12 impellers, as well as primary radial blades impeller, were investigated in this study. The results showed that all forward blades have higher head coefficients than radial blades impeller at design flow coefficient. It was found that regenerative pumps with symmetric <b>angle</b> forward <b>blades</b> have better performance than other types. Also, it is worth mentioning that the highest head coefficient and efficiency occur at angle + 10 <β<+ 30 of symmetric <b>angle</b> <b>blades.</b> It was found that the maximum efficiency occurs at angle of + 15. 5 ° by curve fitting to the data obtained from numerical simulations for symmetric <b>angle</b> forward <b>blades...</b>|$|R

50|$|Dukhan {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} Paleolithic sites in the peninsula. One of the largest bifaces in Qatar, measuring 35 cm in length and 12 cm in width, was previously recovered from Dukhan. In 1960, the largest Paleolithic flint chipping site at that time was discovered 5 km south of Dukhan, around 500 ft from the shore. It covered 2.5 acres and contained an assortment of Stone Age implements such as arrowheads, <b>blades,</b> <b>scrapers</b> and hand axes. In Ras Uwainat Ali, 10 km north of Dukhan, camping grounds and flint tools were discovered. The archaeological sites of Ras Abrouq, Zekreet and Al Da'asa are also in the vicinity of Dukhan.|$|R
30|$|Reconstruction was {{performed}} with a nine-hole 95 ° <b>angle</b> <b>blade</b> plate and cancellous bone graft. The patient {{was placed in}} a lateral decubitus position; through a lateral approach, the hip plate and the screws were removed, and the lateral aspect of femur and the non-union site were exposed. At the same time, autogenous bone for graft was harvested from the ipsilateral anterior iliac crest. The fracture site was found to be grossly unstable under the stress of abduction and adduction by manual testing. Fibrous tissue between fracture ends was removed by curettage, and a 60 -mm length <b>angle</b> <b>blade</b> plate inserted into the original window for the previous hip plate supplemented with a 60 -mm cancellous screw in order to secure the proximal fragment. Following this, the non-union was reduced and the distal segment fixed to the shaft of the <b>angle</b> <b>blade</b> plate through six screws (12 cortices). Finally, autogenous bone graft was packed around the fracture site. To prevent implant overloading, partial weight-bearing was not permitted until eight weeks following surgery.|$|R

40|$|The contra {{rotating}} {{wind turbine}} is a horizontal axis turbine which has two shaft rotating {{in opposite directions}} on the same axis, and it can work at low wind speeds. In general, {{the performance of the}} wind turbine are affected by several factors, which is the aerodynamics shape of turbine, the numbers of blade and the selection <b>angle</b> of <b>blade.</b> In this study, conducted by determining the variation of <b>angle</b> on the <b>blade</b> and the <b>blade</b> <b>angle</b> used in the study is 0 o, 5 o, and 10 o, on the two rotors with diameter of front rotor is 0. 50 meters and the rear rotor is 0. 30 meters, with the position of the rotor blade is coincident with each other. The purpose of this study, is to determine the effect of <b>blade</b> <b>angle</b> variation on the turbine rotation (rpm), torque (T), the power coefficient (Cp), torque coefficient (Cq) and the efficient of the turbine at any wind speeds variations. On the graph relation of <b>blade</b> <b>angle</b> on the shaft rotation, turbine rotation riding known to along with the addition of <b>angle</b> of the <b>blade.</b> The speed of wind is very affect on the output or mechanical power and power coefficient.

30|$|The <b>blade</b> of the <b>angle</b> <b>blade</b> plate offers good {{purchase}} of the proximal fragment and secures it under rotational and bending stresses. In addition, supplementary fixation with one cancellous screw helps. We chose a nine-hole 95 ° <b>angle</b> <b>blade</b> plate for salvage surgery of the failed osteotomy because the longer shaft of this plate would provide greater purchase and stability of the distal fragment. This was borne by the mobility of the patient recovering to the pre-injury level within three months following our treatment and the non-union radiologically healed at 10 months after surgery. We recommend that distal fragments should be fixed with at least seven cortices {{for this type of}} osteotomy.|$|R
