5|$|English cuisine {{encompasses}} the cooking styles, traditions and recipes associated with England. It has distinctive attributes of its own, but also shares much with wider British cuisine, partly through {{the importation of}} ingredients and ideas from North America, China, and India {{during the time of}} the British Empire <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> post-war immigration.|$|E
5|$|Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager {{indicates}} that “Thumbelina” {{was the first}} of Andersen's tales to dramatize the sufferings of one who is different, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> being different, becomes the object of mockery. It was also the first of Andersen's tales to incorporate the swallow as the symbol of the poetic soul and Andersen’s identification with the swallow as a migratory bird whose pattern of life his own traveling days were beginning to resemble.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue that}} {{strained}} the UN logistics system {{was the lack}} of a previously drafted resupply plan. Consumption rates differed among the various units <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a lack of coordination, some UN units faced supply shortages when other units would request more material than they actually needed. In order to rectify this situation UN logisticians were forced to hastily create a plan as the need arose.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, Spain's General Francisco Franco briefly {{considered}} a naval building program after seizing {{power in the}} Spanish Civil War. Franco concluded several agreements with the Italian government that {{would have seen the}} building of four Littorio-class battleships in Spain. The Italians promised to provide all necessary technical and material support for the construction of the ships. The Italian Navy pushed to modernize and enlarge the existing shipyards in Spain, so that they could handle a vessel as large as the Littorio class. The project was abandoned after Italy became involved in World War II, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> limited Spanish industrial capacity.|$|E

However, the Ottoman Empire's entry into the war on Germany's side on 29 October meant that the strategically vital Suez Canal was threatened, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> this and overcrowding in training grounds in the United Kingdom, upon the convoy reaching the Suez at the end of November, plans {{for the use of the}} Australian force were changed and they were disembarked in Egypt instead.|$|E

At age five, Jackson mimicked his father in a speech atop a milk crate at the Operation PUSH headquarters.

5|$|Judy Taylor, {{author of}} several books about Potter and her works, observes that Potter had {{difficulty}} drawing the human form, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> her limitations, restricted depictions of Mr. McGregor in The Flopsy Bunnies to his hands and feet. Any awkwardness in their depictions was minimized by presenting his hands and feet in isolation and from the bunnies' point of view. In the few full-length illustrations of Mr. McGregor, the need to depict his face was eliminated by presenting him in the middle or far distance and from the rear.|$|E

5|$|Oil {{reserves}} {{discovered in}} the later 20th century in the seas both east and west of Shetland have provided a much-needed alternative {{source of income for}} the islands. The East Shetland Basin is one of Europe's largest oil fields <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the oil revenue and the cultural links with Norway, a small Home Rule movement developed briefly to recast the constitutional position of Shetland.

5|$|Typhoon Pongsona {{produced}} {{strong wind}} gusts peaking at 278km/h (173mph 1-min), which left the entire island of Guam without power and destroyed about 1,300houses. With strong building standards and experience from repeated typhoon strikes, {{there were no}} fatalities directly related to Pongsona, although there was one indirect death from flying glass. Damage on the island totaled over $700million (2002 USD, $ USD), making Pongsona among the five costliest typhoons on the island. The typhoon also caused heavy damage on Rota {{and elsewhere in the}} Northern Mariana Islands, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> its impact the name was retired.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Tapps in 1835, his son Sir George William Tapps-Gervis {{inherited}} his father's estate. He hired the young local architect Benjamin Ferrey to develop the coastal area {{on the east side}} of the stream. Bournemouth's first hotel, later to become part of the Royal Bath Hotel, opened in 1838 and is one of the few buildings designed by Ferrey still standing. Bournemouth started to grow at a faster rate as Tapps-Gervis began developing the area similarly to the south coast resorts of Weymouth and Brighton. Despite enormous investment, the town's share of the market remained modest. In 1841 Tapps-Gervis invited the physician and writer Augustus Granville to stay. Granville was the author of The Spas of England, which described health resorts around the country, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> his visit he included a chapter on Bournemouth in the second edition of his book. The publication of the book, and the increase in visitors seeking the medicinal use of seawater and the pine-scented air, helped the town to grow and establish itself as an early tourist destination.|$|E
5|$|Chinese troops counterattacked {{in force}} at 23:00, with two battalions of {{infantry}} supported by snipers and mortar fire. Aided by 7th Division artillery fire, the Rangers held the hill against Chinese resistance. The Rangers repulsed four successive Chinese assaults {{by one of}} the battalions, expending all of their grenades by 02:00 on 18 May, and running short on ammunition by 03:00. At that point, the second Chinese battalion commenced its assault, surprising the Rangers and driving them from the peak of Hill 581. Queen counterattacked and retook the hill by 05:00. At 06:45, the Chinese gave up the attack, having been severely mauled. In the unsuccessful attempt to take Hill 581, Chinese losses amounted to at least 120 killed and several hundred injured. The Rangers, having relied on tight interlocking crossfire and well dug-in positions, suffered only 10 wounded in the battle. Commanders in the 7th Infantry Division were stunned by the 2nd Ranger Company's effectiveness in the fight, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the action, the company came to be considered a model unit.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started at}} this station in 1969, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the New York City fiscal crisis in 1975, the station did not open until 1989. Originally, {{the station was}} {{intended}} to be a transfer point between passengers from the Sixth Avenue–Queens service and from the Broadway–Second Avenue service. This station was designed to allow for cross-platform transfers. However, in 1975, while the station was being built, construction was halted on the Second Avenue Subway. As a result, the side of the station intended for service to Second Avenue, the BMT side, was walled off with a temporary orange brick wall. Also, space intended for an exit at Third Avenue was left unused. While the Sixth Avenue side opened for service in 1989, the other side was only used for storing Broadway Line trains. The station appeared as if it had one side platform on each level.|$|E

5|$|Elected {{with support}} from the Farmers' Alliance <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> {{agricultural}} protest, Tillman was thought likely to join the Populists in their challenge to the established parties. Tillman refused, and generally opposed Populist positions that went beyond his program of increasing access to higher education and reform of the Democratic Party (white supremacy was not a Populist position). The Alliance (and Populists) demanded a system of subtreasuries under the federal government, that could accept farmers' crops and advance them 80 percent of the value interest-free. Tillman, not wanting more federal officeholders in the state (that in Republican administrations might be filled by African Americans), initially opposed the proposal. Many farmers felt strongly about this issue, and in 1891, Tillman was censured by the state Alliance for his opposition. Attuned to political necessities, Tillman gradually came to support the subtreasuries in time for his re-election campaign in 1892, though he was never an active proponent.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{may occur}} {{as a result of}} a number of other {{conditions}} including tumors, strokes, head trauma, previous infections of the central nervous system, genetic abnormalities, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> brain damage around the time of birth. Of those with brain tumors, almost 30% have epilepsy, making them the cause of about 4% of cases. The risk is greatest for tumors in the temporal lobe and those that grow slowly. Other mass lesions such as cerebral cavernous malformations and arteriovenous malformations have risks as high as 4060%. Of those who have had a stroke, 2–4% develop epilepsy. In the United Kingdom strokes account for 15% of cases and it is believed to be the cause in 30% of the elderly. Between 6 and 20% of epilepsy is believed to be due to head trauma. Mild brain injury increases the risk about two-fold while severe brain injury increases the risk seven-fold. In those who have experienced a high-powered gunshot wound to the head, the risk is about 50%.|$|E
5|$|Farnese besieged Maastricht {{in command}} of 15,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry, 20 cannons and 4,000 sappers, joined later by 5,000 {{additional}} troops. In May, while the siege developed, peace talks were held at Cologne under the mediation of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf to preserve {{the unity of the}} Netherlands. However, divisions become more serious during the process. In Brussels, fight erupted in early June between Catholics headed by Philip of Egmont, son of Lamoral of Egmont, whom the Royalist authorities had executed in 1568 and Calvinists under Olivier van den Tympel, resulting in the expulsion of Egmont and his supporters. At Mechelen, the Catholic inhabitants forced the Dutch garrison to leave, while in 's-Hertogenbosch an armed struggle resulted in the magistrates declaring support to the Royalist side. The revolt took a character of civil war, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the religious problem, the peace conference at Cologne failed. Henceforth, Farnese reconquered Flanders and the Brabant town after town, even forcing Antwerp to surrender after a long and exhausting siege in 1585.|$|E
