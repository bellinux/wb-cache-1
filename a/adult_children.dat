40|$|Using an {{innovative}} factorial vignette design embedded in an Internet survey, this study investigates how the family status of an <b>adult</b> <b>child</b> affects {{attitudes toward the}} desirability of intergenerational co-residence in response to economic hardship. Americans express greater support for co-residence between an <b>adult</b> <b>child</b> and a parent when the <b>adult</b> <b>child</b> is single rather than partnered. Support for co-residence is weaker if the <b>adult</b> <b>child</b> is cohabiting rather than married to the partner, although groups with greater exposure to cohabitation make less of a distinction between marriage and cohabitation. The presence of a grandchild does not affect views about extending help through co-residence.

5|$|After the 1836 election, Harrison did {{not really}} stop running for president, nor did his {{supporters}} stop boosting him—an Ohio political convention endorsed him as early as 1837. His finances were somewhat secured by his appointment as clerk of Hamilton County's circuit court, a post that paid no salary, but allowed considerable income from fees. The years between 1838 and 1840 were years of personal tragedy for the general, as three of his <b>adult</b> <b>children</b> died and his wife Anna fell seriously ill. Harrison {{did his best to}} manage a network of acquaintances and supporters from his home in North Bend, corresponding extensively and seeking to have items favorable to him placed in the newspapers.|$|E
40|$|Background: Given {{the growing}} life expectancy, the {{likelihood}} increases that health-care providers {{are confronted with}} older people having an <b>adult</b> <b>child</b> with a life-limiting disease. Aim: This literature review aimed to (1) explore the experiences of aged parents {{with regard to their}} position and role as a parent of an <b>adult</b> <b>child</b> with a life-limiting illness, (2) detect gaps in the existing literature and (3) make recommendations for future research. Design: A literature search of English articles, including both quantitative and qualitative designs. Data sources: Four electronic databases and the reference lists of included studies. Results: In total, 19 studies (7 quantitative and 12 qualitative) were included. Few studies describe the experiences of older people whose <b>adult</b> <b>child</b> has cancer or has died of cancer. Existing studies are merely descriptive and give no concrete recommendations for health-care providers in daily practice. The studies suggest that aged parents carry deep burdens from the prospect of losing their <b>adult</b> <b>child.</b> Aged parents want to stay involved but need to reconfigure their parent role. As soon as the cancer diagnosis is disclosed, parents are confronted with a re-awakening of parental nurturing, which clashes with the autonomy of the <b>adult</b> <b>child.</b> Even after the <b>adult</b> <b>child</b> is deceased, older parents retain the image of themselves as parents. Conclusions: There is a need for more in-depth research to understand the lived experience of these parents and what health-care providers can do to assist them...|$|R

5|$|From July 1895 to March 1901 Harrison {{served on}} the Board of Trustees of Purdue University, where Harrison Hall, a dormitory, was named in his honor. He wrote a series of {{articles}} about {{the federal government and the}} presidency which were republished in 1897 as a book titled This Country of Ours. In 1896, Harrison at age 62 remarried, to Mary Scott Lord Dimmick, the widowed 37-year-old niece and former secretary of his deceased wife. Harrison's two <b>adult</b> <b>children,</b> Russell, 41 years old at the time, and Mary (Mamie) McKee, 38, disapproved of the marriage and did not attend the wedding.

Nixon and Khrushchev had an impassioned {{argument}} in a model kitchen at the American National Exhibition in Moscow, with each defending the economic system of his country. Khrushchev was invited to visit the United States, and did so that September, spending thirteen days. Khrushchev arrived in Washington, DC on his first {{visit to the}} United States on 15 September 1959. The first visit by a Soviet premier to the United States resulted in an extended media circus. Khrushchev brought his wife, Nina Petrovna, and <b>adult</b> <b>children</b> with him, though it was not usual for Soviet officials to travel with their families. The peripatetic premier visited New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco (visiting a supermarket), Coon Rapids, Iowa (visiting Roswell Garst's farm), Pittsburgh, and Washington, concluding with a meeting with U.S. President Eisenhower at Camp David. During luncheon at the Twentieth Century-Fox Studio in Los Angeles Khrushchev engaged in an improvised yet jovial debate with his host Spyros Skouras over the respective merits of capitalism and communism. Khrushchev was supposed to visit Disneyland, but the visit was canceled for security reasons, much to his disgruntlement. He did, however, visit Eleanor Roosevelt at her home in Hyde Park, New York. While visiting IBM's new research campus in San Jose, California, Khrushchev expressed little interest in computer technology, but he greatly admired the self-service cafeteria, and, on his return, introduced self-service in the Soviet Union.|$|E

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2011. Major: Family Social Science. Advisor: Marlene S. Stum. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 145 pages, appendices I-II. Using stress process and life course theory, this dissertation investigated pathways of <b>adult</b> <b>child</b> caregivers' family (caregiving, marital, parenting) and non-family (employment) roles and {{their relation to}} caregiver psychological and physical health over time. Eight waves of data (1992 - 2006) from the Health and Retirement Study were analyzed for 1, 300 <b>adult</b> <b>child</b> caregivers. Latent class analysis provided strong substantive and statistical evidence for a 4 -class model of caregivers' role pathways. The four pathways were (a) Married, Working Caregivers (22. 5 %), (b) Married, Retired Caregivers with Co-Residing Child (12. 5 %), (c) Married, Retired Caregivers (30. 5 %), and (d) Not Married, Retired Caregivers (34. 6 %). Married, Working Caregivers, who {{were more likely to}} be male, White, and younger than most other pathways, had more optimal psychological and subjective physical health, but were more likely to have high blood pressure compared to caregivers in other pathways. Results suggest that (a) <b>adult</b> <b>child</b> caregivers have distinct family and non-family role pathways, (b) caregivers' gender, race/ethnicity, and age predict pathway membership, and (c) caregivers' role pathways are connected to psychological and physical health over time. Future research should explore how <b>adult</b> <b>child</b> caregivers' role pathways structurally differ for male versus female and younger versus older caregivers to further explain the heterogeneity of <b>adult</b> <b>child</b> caregivers' role pathways. Family practitioners may be helpful in identifying practices and policies that help <b>adult</b> <b>child</b> caregivers manage their diverse range of long-term family and non-family roles...|$|R

5000|$|Family estrangement is the {{physical}} or emotional distancing between {{at least two}} family members in an arrangement which is usually considered unsatisfactory {{by at least one}} involved party. Family estrangements can be attributed to any of several factors within the family, such as attachment disorders, differing values and beliefs, disappointment, major life events or change, or poor communication. In one typical scenario, an <b>adult</b> <b>child</b> ceases contact with his or her parents and possibly other family members as the <b>adult</b> <b>child</b> transitions into adulthood. In another scenario, an intolerant parent casts out an <b>adult</b> <b>child</b> because of life choices.
