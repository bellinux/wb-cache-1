25|$|The Second Generation Prius {{contains}} a 1.310kWh battery, composed of 28 modules. Each battery module {{is made of}} 6 individual 1.2V 6.5Ah Prismatic NiMH cells in series forming a 7.2V 6.5Ah module with 46Wh/kg energy density and 1.3kW/kg output power density. Each module {{contains a}}n integrated charge controller and relay. These modules are connected 28 in series to form a 201.6V 6.5Ah battery (traction battery), {{also known as the}} energy storage system. The computer controlled charge controller and battery management computer systems keep this battery between 38% and 82% state of charge, with a tendency to keep the average state of charge around 60%. By shallow cycling the battery {{only a small portion of}} its net available energy storage capacity is available for use (approximately 400Wh) by the hybrid drive system, but the shallow computer controlled cycling dramatically improves the cycle life, thermal management control, and net long term calendar life of the battery. Active cooling of this battery is achieved by a blower motor and <b>air</b> <b>ducting,</b> while passive thermal management was accomplished through the metal case design.|$|E

50|$|The {{mechanical}} disadvantages {{are largely}} those of added complexity. Undriven wheels require a brake shaft. Mounted inboard, {{it is more}} difficult to arrange for cooling air to flow over the rotor and <b>air</b> <b>ducting</b> can be required to prevent brake fade.|$|E

50|$|For liquid-cooled vehicles, however, this layout {{presents}} a disadvantage, since it requires either increased coolant piping from a front-mounted radiator (meaning more weight and complexity), or relocating the radiator(s) {{to the sides}} or rear, and adding <b>air</b> <b>ducting</b> {{to compensate for the}} lower airflow {{at the rear of the}} car.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. CFD {{technique}} is often employed to simulate and optimize <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> design, but the corresponding experiment validation in metro vehicle is rare. By taking an independent metro vehicle duct as research object in this paper, supply <b>air</b> through <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> is simulated and {{compared with the}} actual test results from the angle of supply air velocity at each outlet and supply air volume through several outlets of <b>air</b> <b>duct.</b> The {{results show that the}} relative deviation of simulation and test value of air velocity at most of the outlets are within or near ± 20 %, which is acceptable for the engineering applications. Moreover, the ratio of supply air volume through several outlets to the corresponding total supply air volume through main <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> or flat duct in the case of simulation is consistent with {{that in the case of}} experiment.

40|$|Background: High-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> is the {{government}} program to supply electricity needs. However, in practice, obstacles {{have been identified in}} the form of rejection from the community due to the outstanding issues that high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> have an impact on health. Aim: This research aims to analysis the magnitude of electromagnetic wave radiation of high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> construction on health. Methods: The study was conducted by measuring electromagnetic wave radiation prior to high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> (150 kV) construction and predicting the amount of radiation generated after this operation and its impact on health. Result: The field measurement result showed that the highest strength of magnetic field in the absence of construction and operation activity of high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> 150 kV was 0. 00085 mT and the highest electric field was 0. 004241251 V/m. The results of the magnetic field strength analysis showed that the highest strength of magnetic field and electric field when the high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> is completed and operated was magnetic field of 0. 00415 mT and electric field of 38. 4 V/m. The value was far lower than the standard limits recommended by IRPA / INIRC, WHO 1990 and SNI 04 - 6950 - 2003. The allowed electric field strength is 5 kV / m and the allowed magnetic field strength is 0. 1 mT. Conclusion: Electromagnetic wave radiation of High-Voltage <b>Air</b> <b>Ducts</b> is not exceeded the allowed limit, so it will not cause a direct risk to health. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{underground}} <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> along peripheral {{walls of}} a building are a remediation method, which principle is to enable an air flow along the moist building structure’s surface to allow a sufficient evaporation of moisture from the structure. This measure reduces the water transport (rising moisture) into the higher parts of the wall where the high water content in masonry is undesirable. Presently, underground <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> are designed as masonry structures, which durability in contact with ground moisture is limited. The article describes a new design of an underground <b>air</b> <b>duct,</b> {{which is based on}} specially shaped concrete blocks (without wet processes, because the blocks are completely precast). The <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> from concrete blocks is situated completely below the ground surface (exterior) or below the floor (interior). Thanks to this, the system is invisible and does not disturb the authentic look of rehabilitated historic buildings. The efficiency of the <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> technical solution was verified by the results of tests (based on the measured moisture values) conducted on a laboratory model.

40|$|The use of {{ventilated}} facades and roofs {{can help}} to reduce summer thermal loads and, therefore, the energy consumption due to air-conditioning systems. This paper discusses a simple analytical method for the calculation of the energy saving achievable by using ventilated facades in which the air flow inside the <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> is due to stack effect. Two particular cases of outstanding importance are investigated. The first in which the inner masonry wall is given, and the <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> and the outer facing have to be optimized. The second in which the outer facing is given, and the inner masonry wall and the <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> have to be optimized. The first case can occur in existing buildings renovation, while the second case can occur during the design process. Finally, {{the influence of the}} variation of some quantities necessary for calculation on the energy performance of ventilated facades is investigated. In particular, the energy performance of such facades results to be strongly influenced by the <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> width, the insulating material distribution, the solar radiation intensity, the wall outer surface thermal resistance and the roughness of the slabs delimiting the <b>air</b> <b>duct...</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{might be}} envisaged {{that such an}} {{increase}} in performance would be widely deployed, but various issues frequently preclude this. The intakes of high-speed engines are difficult to design, and they can't simply be located anywhere on the airframe whilst getting reasonable performance - in general the entire airframe needs to be built around the intake design. Another {{problem is that the}} air eventually runs out, so the amount of additional thrust is limited by how fast the rocket climbs. Finally, the <b>air</b> <b>ducting</b> weighs about 5× to 10× more than an equivalent rocket that gives the same thrust. This slows the vehicle quite a bit {{towards the end of the}} burn.|$|E

One such design was measured lifting the temperature of a house to 24 C on a partially sunny winter day (-7 °C or 19 °F), and it is claimed that the system provides passively for the bulk of the building's heating.
