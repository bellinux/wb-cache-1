500|$|The show's {{eleventh}} series saw musical montage or [...] "songtage" [...] segments become {{standard in}} each episode, introduced by McHale {{as a means}} of modernising the show. Although McHale initially considered commissioning original pieces, budgetary constraints limited choices to pre-existing tracks. The use of songtages was first popularised by the US medical drama Grey's Anatomy, however McHale stated he was unaware of this until Holby City had already adopted the technique. Music was generally selected by each episode's scriptwriter. If the writer was not specific about which songs should be used, the producers and director would select the music in post-production. Actors also have some input: Hugh Quarshie personally selected the music he believed his character Ric Griffin would listen to in theatre. Asked in June 2010 whether she felt songtages were appropriate for a serious drama show, Kyle responded: [...] "Yes – sometimes. On a multi-strand series such as Holby, they are <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>way</b> of telling stories visually – a moment from each – to open or close an episode or create the passing of time in a concise way for the audience." [...] Kris Green of entertainment and media website Digital Spy suggested that the number of songs used per episode could be [...] "very jarring", to which Kyle replied: [...] "We plan to use music carefully in the future – maybe 'songtages', as above – and sourced music within a scene, that is music actually playing in the scene itself, for example on a radio – but less incidental." ...|$|E

30|$|Bamboo grows quickly, and it {{will grow}} into useful timber in a short time. So it becomes the most {{important}} resources that get {{a wide range of}} applications in industry. A large number of residues were produced in the process of bamboo timbers. According to the statistical analysis [1 – 6], bamboo utilization rate usually < 40  % in the process of bamboo floor, bamboo plywood, bamboo mat and so on. Therefore, more than 60  % of the bamboo in processing becomes residues. However, only a subsection of the residues are utilized, and the majority are burnt or discarded. Apart from wasting resource, it seriously pollutes the environment. Consequently, to make full use of resource, it is necessary to find a new method that can utilize the bamboo processing residues efficiently.

2500|$|In the Nicomachean Ethics, {{written in}} 350 BCE, Aristotle stated that {{happiness}} (also being well and doing well) {{is the only}} thing that humans desire for its own sake, unlike riches, honour, health or friendship. He observed that men sought riches, or honour, or health not only for their own sake but also in order to be happy. Note that eudaimonia, the term we translate as [...] "happiness", is for Aristotle an activity rather than an emotion or a state. Thus understood, the happy life is the good life, that is, a life in which a person fulfills human nature in <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>way.</b> Specifically, Aristotle argues that the good life is the life of excellent rational activity. [...] He arrives at this claim with the Function Argument. [...] Basically, if it's right, every living thing has a function, that which it uniquely does. For humans, Aristotle contends, our function is to reason, since it is that alone that we uniquely do. And performing one's function well, or excellently, is one's good. Thus, the life of excellent rational activity is the happy life. Aristotle does not leave it at that, however. For he argues that there is a second best life for those incapable of excellent rational activity. This second best life is the life of moral virtue.|$|E
