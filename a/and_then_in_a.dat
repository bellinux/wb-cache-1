This was his first loss to Querrey in five career meetings. In Canada, Murray became the first player since Andre Agassi in 1995 to defend the Canadian Masters. Murray {{defeated}} Nadal and then Federer in straight sets, ending his eight-month title drought. At the Cincinnati Masters, Murray first complained about {{the speed of the}} court, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> quarterfinal match with Fish, Murray complained that the organisers refused to put the match on later in the day With temperatures reaching 33°C in the shade, Murray won the first set in a tie-breaker but began to feel ill.

5|$|The New Parishes Act 1844 {{allowed for}} the {{creation}} of a parish for Chadderton, dedicated to St Matthew the Evangelist. Services were initially held in the stables of Chadderton Hall, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> temporary wooden structure opened in 1848. The Church of St Matthew was opened for the parish in 1857 by the then Bishop of Manchester, James Prince Lee. A steeple was added in 1881. Following the construction of this church, four followed. There are now several Anglican parishes, and within them daughter and mission churches, serving the town. The parish of St Matthew united with the neighbouring parish of St Luke, and the United Benefice of St Matthew with St Luke now lies within the Oldham West Deanery of the Diocese of Manchester. The parish of Christ Church, founded in 1870, which also contains the church of St Saviour's and Crossley Christian Centre, is one of the largest numerically in the township and lies on the border with Werneth. The parish of Emmanuel, now meeting in the St George's building on Broadway, was originally part of Christ Church parish. Also within this deanery is the Parish Church of St Mark, built in the early1960s. It is a blue brick building with a graduated slate pitched roof, and a rectangular brick steeple with a high gabled roof. It was granted Grade II listed building status in 1998.|$|E

5|$|The {{authorities}} {{responded to}} the chaos with emergency legislation; the Ordinance of Labourers was passed in 1349, and the Statute of Labourers in 1351. These attempted to fix wages at pre-plague levels, making {{it a crime to}} refuse work or to break an existing contract, imposing fines on those who transgressed. The system was initially enforced through special Justices of Labourers and then, from the 1360s onwards, through the normal Justices of the Peace, typically members of the local gentry. Although in theory these laws applied to both labourers seeking higher wages and to employers tempted to outbid their competitors for workers, they were in practice applied only to labourers, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rather arbitrary fashion. The legislation was strengthened in 1361, with the penalties increased to include branding and imprisonment. The royal government had not intervened in this way before, nor allied itself with the local landowners in quite such an obvious or unpopular way.|$|E
5|$|The use of melisma, {{a gospel}} {{tradition}} adapted by vocalists Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey {{would become a}} cornerstone of contemporary R singers {{beginning in the late}} 1980s and throughout the 1990s. Hip hop came to influence contemporary R later in the 1980s, first through new jack swing <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> related series of subgenres called hip hop soul and neo soul. Hip hop soul and neo soul developed later, in the 1990s. Typified by the work of Mary J. Blige and R. Kelly, the former is a mixture of contemporary R with hip hop beats, while the images and themes of gangsta rap may be present. The latter is a more experimental, edgier, and generally less mainstream combination of 1960s and 1970s-style soul vocals with some hip hop influence, and has earned some mainstream recognition through the work of D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Alicia Keys, and Lauryn Hill. D'Angelo's critically acclaimed album Voodoo (2000) has been recognized by music writers as a masterpiece and the cornerstone of the neo soul genre.|$|E

Despite wrestling on the November 25 episode of Impact! as a face, when she answered the challenge of TNA Women's Knockout Champion Madison Rayne and then defeated her in a non-title match, Sarita resumed her status as a heel and her feud with Sky on the December 9 episode of Impact! when, despite losing to her and Love {{in the first round}} match of a tournament for the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship, Sarita claimed that Sky was a loser, and {{would never be able to}} beat her. On the December 23 episode of Impact!, Sky was set to wrestle for the Knockouts Tag Team Championship, but was forced to miss the match, after being attacked backstage by Sarita. The following week, Sarita defeated Sky in a Strap match.
