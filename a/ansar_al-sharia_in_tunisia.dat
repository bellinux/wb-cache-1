25|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} Salafist organizations is <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Sharia</b> <b>in</b> <b>Tunisia</b> (AST) that was highly involved in the political scene before being listed by the government as a terrorist group. The group was founded in April 2011 by Abu Iyadh al-Tunisi, who had previously co-founded the Tunisian Combat Group (TCG) in Afghanistan with Tarek Maaroufi. Unlike Al-Qaeda and other like-minded groups in the Arab world, the AST claims to be non-violent and engages in charitable activity as a way of gaining support providing food, medicine and clothing {{while at the same time}} preaching mainstream Salafist thinking. However, they have been involved in numerous violent incidents such as their alleged role in the storming of the US embassy in Tunis and an attack on a television station that showed the animated film Persepolis because it depicted God while repeatedly calling for the Islamization of the Tunisian media. They have also carried out attacks on art exhibits, premises that sell alcohol and ransacked ancient shrines it considered un-Islamic.|$|E

5000|$|In its weekly {{newspaper}} al-Naba, {{in an article}} eulogizing Shaykh Abu Layla Kamal Zarruq at-Tunisi al-Qurashi, a Tunisian leader in the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the Islamic State severely criticised <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Sharia</b> <b>in</b> <b>Tunisia</b> and its leader Abu Iyad, saying [...] "The Ansar ash-Shari’ah organization, which was at the forefront, suffered from several problems, the most important being the misguidance of its leader, Abu ‘Iyad, and his promotion of Ayman al-Zawahiri ideas regarding their intention to make Tunisia an ’ard da’wah” (land of invitation) and not an “ard jihad” (land of waging jihad), which reassured the taghut so-called“post-Arab revolutions governments” {{that they would not}} fight them, instead asking them to give them room to simply “invite”. It also suffered from Abu ‘Iyad’s ideas that were restricted to the country, focused on limiting the work to Tunisia, and based on his desire to lead the global jihad, despite his lack of experience and his weakness, which in turn led his organization in to the abyss when the new taghut revealed to them its new face".|$|E
