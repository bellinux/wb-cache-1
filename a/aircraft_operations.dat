5|$|JAL Cargo ended {{dedicated}} freighter <b>aircraft</b> <b>operations</b> in October 2010 {{after more}} than 30 years of service. It operated both propeller and jet aircraft through the years, most recently Boeing 747-400s (including aircraft converted from passenger to freighter configuration) and Boeing 767-300Fs. Limited cargo activity is now maintained through JAL's passenger aircraft lower deck holds.|$|E
5|$|To reduce {{rolling and}} {{increase}} stability for <b>aircraft</b> <b>operations,</b> a gyrostabilizer {{produced by the}} American Sperry Gyroscope Company was installed. The installation initially proved unreliable as the Japanese technicians were badly trained by Sperry, but eventually the system proved its worth as the technicians gained experience.|$|E
500|$|The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines general {{aviation}} (GA) as [...] "an <b>aircraft</b> <b>operation</b> {{other than a}} commercial air transport operation or an aerial work operation."

5|$|The Norwegian Air Ambulance {{operates}} both {{a helicopter}} and fixed-wing air ambulance service out of Brønnøysund Airport. <b>Aircraft</b> <b>operations</b> are subcontracted to Lufttransport, which operates an AgustaWestland AW139 helicopter and a Beech King Air fixed-wing aircraft. Both are manned by medical personnel from Helgeland Hospital Trust. In 2011, the helicopter flew 465 missions and the fixed-wing aircraft 1022 missions.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{became the}} subject of an Inquiry chaired by a Supreme Court judge. In the absence of evidence indicating the source of any water in the fuel, the Inquiry dismissed the submission that water was responsible for the accident. The Inquiry did not determine the cause of the accident but it made recommendations to enhance the safety of <b>aircraft</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E
5|$|Proposals were {{submitted}} by Boeing, General Dynamics and North American Rockwell in January 1970. In June 1970, North American Rockwell's design was selected and {{was awarded a}} development contract. The original program called for two test airframes, five flyable aircraft, and 40 engines. This was cut in 1971 to one ground and three flight test aircraft. The company {{changed its name to}} Rockwell International and named its aircraft division North American <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Operations</b> in 1973. A fourth prototype, built to production standards, was ordered in the fiscal year 1976 budget. Plans called for 240 B-1As to be built, with initial operational capability set for 1979.|$|E

50|$|In 1978, a {{consultant}} firm {{was appointed to}} select a new site for a completely new airport and thus proceeded with the Master Plan Study regarding {{the layout of the}} new airport. The development plan of the new airport back then is to accommodate the Fokker F27 turboprop <b>aircraft</b> <b>operation</b> in the beginning and thereafter Boeing 737-200 jet <b>aircraft</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|R

5|$|The main {{airport for}} Roskilde is Copenhagen Airport {{which can be}} reached in about 40 minutes by train. Since April 1973, {{there has also been}} the small local Roskilde Airport, serving light {{aircraft}} for training, taxi, and flight instruction. There are plans to expand it for use by larger aircraft, possibly including discount international flights. The plans were approved, but lack of commitment from any carriers has postponed progress. The airport currently handles up to 100,000 operations (flights) per year, most of which are light <b>aircraft</b> <b>operations</b> associated with school flights.|$|E
5|$|This CATOBAR {{arrangement}} {{allows for}} faster launching and recovery {{as well as}} a much wider range of aircraft that can be used on board compared with smaller aircraft carriers, most of which use a simpler STOVL arrangement without catapults or arrestor wires. The ship's <b>aircraft</b> <b>operations</b> are controlled by the air boss from Primary Flight Control or Pri-Fly. Four large elevators transport aircraft between the flight deck and the hangars below. These hangars are divided into three bays by thick steel doors that are designed to restrict the spread of fire.|$|E
5|$|In early March, the {{formation}} of the 4th Army was accompanied by the development of even closer coordination and liaison with the two squadrons. Air marker panels began to be used to show the forward line of friendly troops and to identify friendly vehicles, and liaison teams were deployed with the commanders of lower-level formations to communicate directly with supporting <b>aircraft.</b> <b>Operations</b> continued across Bosnia and Dalmatia in March, and were extended to include support to advances in the Lika region and during the capture of Sarajevo and Bihać. As Axis forces withdrew west towards Zagreb, the Hurricanes of No. 351 Squadron continued to harry them, ambushing convoys and rocketing artillery positions. Between 1 January and 31 March 1945, the Hurricanes of No. 351 Squadron not only flew from Cannae and Vis, but also from the airfields at Zemunik and Prkos on the mainland. In the same period the squadron lost four aircraft and suffered damage to fifteen others. Of the lost aircraft, two were destroyed {{as a result of a}} collision, one was lost after engine failure, and only one was lost to anti-aircraft fire. Four aircraft were damaged by anti-aircraft fire, the remainder being damaged by fragments from their own rockets.|$|E

25|$|The NOAA Hurricane Hunters are a {{group of}} {{aircraft}} that work under the <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Operations</b> Center (AOC), located at Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in Lakeland, Florida, United States. The <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Operations</b> Center is under the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO), which is {{a branch of the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which is in turn an agency of the Department of Commerce. The AOC resided at MacDill AFB from January 1993 to June 2017.|$|E

5|$|Services were {{originally}} flown using a Dornier Do 328 operated by Sun Air of Scandinavia. Later in that year, Krohn Air acquired a Jetstream 32 and started flights from Molde to Bergen Airport, Flesland and Stavanger Airport, Sola, but these services {{did not have}} sufficient patronage and were later terminated. By 2011, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>operation</b> was transferred to Helitrans. In the spring of 2013 the <b>aircraft</b> <b>operation</b> was transferred to AIS Airlines, using two British Aerospace Jetstream 32. The airline started a service from Ålesund Airport, Vigra to Trondheim in March 2013, but pulled out in September. The airline ceased operations on 4 February 2014.|$|R
