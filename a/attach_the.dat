5|$|OTG devices {{attached}} {{either to}} a peripheral-only B-device or a standard/embedded host have their role fixed by the cable, since in these scenarios {{it is only}} possible to <b>attach</b> <b>the</b> cable one way.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{breakout}} crew in {{the weapons}} storage began {{to inspect the}} missiles, an early-arriving transport crew hooked up the pylons and towed them away without inspecting or ensuring that the missiles had been inspected or cleared for removal. The munitions control center failed to verify that the pylon had received proper clearance and inspection and approved the pylon for loading on the B-52 at 0925. After taking eight hours to <b>attach</b> <b>the</b> pylons, the aircraft with the missiles loaded then remained parked overnight at Minot for 15 hours without the special guard required for nuclear weapons.|$|E
50|$|The {{elements}} of anchoring gear include the anchor, the cable (also called a rode), <b>the</b> method of <b>attaching</b> <b>the</b> two together, <b>the</b> method of <b>attaching</b> <b>the</b> cable to the ship, charts, and {{a method of}} learning {{the depth of the}} water.|$|R
50|$|During launch, {{the camera}} films downward; showing {{the launch pad}} and engine exhaust during ascent. The rocket's nose cone may be <b>attached</b> to <b>the</b> {{parachute}} in two ways; there are attachments {{on both ends of}} <b>the</b> nose cone. <b>Attaching</b> <b>the</b> parachute to the bottom films the parachute during descent. <b>Attaching</b> <b>the</b> parachute to the top films the approach of the ground during descent.|$|R

5|$|Decorative sword {{mountings}} of the kazari-tachi type {{carried on}} the tradition of ancient straight Chinese style tachi and were used by nobles at court ceremonies until the Muromachi period. They contained a very narrow crude unsharpened blade. Two mountain-shaped metal fittings were provided to <b>attach</b> <b>the</b> straps; the scabbard between was covered by a (tube) fitting. The hilt was covered with ray skin and the scabbard typically decorated in maki-e or mother of pearl.|$|E
5|$|In word learning, {{the mapping}} problem {{refers to the}} {{question}} of how infants <b>attach</b> <b>the</b> forms of language to the things that they experience in the world. There are infinite objects, concepts, and actions in the world that words could be mapped onto. Many theories have been proposed to account for the way in which the language learner successfully maps words onto the correct objects, concepts, and actions.|$|E
5|$|The spores of L.echinatum, roughly spherical with warts on the surface, have diameters between 4 and 6µm. The capillitia (coarse {{thick-walled}} hyphae in the gleba) are elastic, {{brown in}} color, contain small pores, and are 5–8µm thick. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells) may {{be attached to}} two to four spores, and the sterigmata (tapered spine-like projections from the basidia that <b>attach</b> <b>the</b> spores) are up to 5µm long.|$|E
25|$|In the 1989 Bond film Licence to Kill, 007 rides down on {{a rescue}} hoist cable from a USCG HH-65 Dauphin, where he <b>attaches</b> <b>the</b> cable to the antagonist's {{aircraft}} tail. Once <b>attached,</b> <b>the</b> Coast Guard helicopter is able to drag the Cessna 172 away.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> {{mesentery}} becomes <b>attached</b> to <b>the</b> colon at the gastrointestinal margin {{and continues}} as the several mesenteries of the mesocolon, sometimes collectively called the mesenteric organ. The {{parts of the}} mesocolon take their names from {{the part of the}} colon to which they <b>attach.</b> These are <b>the</b> transverse mesocolon <b>attaching</b> to <b>the</b> transverse colon, <b>the</b> sigmoid mesocolon <b>attaching</b> to <b>the</b> sigmoid colon, <b>the</b> mesoappendix <b>attaching</b> to <b>the</b> appendix, and <b>the</b> mesorectum <b>attaching</b> to <b>the</b> upper third of the rectum.|$|R
40|$|A {{gearing system}} using modular gear bearing {{component}}s. Each component {{is composed of}} a core, one or more modules <b>attached</b> to <b>the</b> core and two or more fastening modules rigidly <b>attaching</b> <b>the</b> modules to the core. The modules, which are <b>attached</b> to <b>the</b> core, may consist of gears, rollers or gear bearing components. The core orientation affects the orientation of <b>the</b> modules <b>attached</b> to <b>the</b> core. This is achieved via the keying arrangement of the core and the component modules that <b>attach</b> to <b>the</b> core. Such an arrangement will also facilitate the phase tuning of gear modules {{with respect to the}} core and other gear modules <b>attached</b> to <b>the</b> core...|$|R
5|$|When {{planning}} began for Operation Torch, the Allied {{invasion of}} North Africa in 1942, {{it was decided}} to <b>attach</b> <b>the</b> 1st Parachute Brigade, part of the 1st Airborne Division, to the Allied forces taking part, as an American airborne unit, the 2nd Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment, was also to be used during the invasion. After a short period of training and being brought up to operational strength, mainly with men from the 2nd Parachute Brigade, also part of the 1st Airborne Division, the brigade was deployed to North Africa in November 1942.|$|E
5|$|While {{hunting the}} boar, Michael is wounded {{by one of}} the animals. Kate starts leading Michael back to the beach, while Locke goes on his own into the jungle. As Kate and Michael head back, she climbs up a tree to <b>attach</b> <b>the</b> antenna. However, before she can finish, she hears the sounds of the monster, causing her to drop and break the equipment. The Monster heads {{straight}} for Locke, who stares straight at it.|$|E
5|$|In the {{anthropomorphic}} form, Varaha {{often has}} a stylized boar face, like the zoomorphic models. The snout may be shorter. The position {{and size of}} the tusks may also be altered. The ears, cheeks and eyes are generally based on human ones. Early sculptors in Udayagiri and Eran faced the issue of how to <b>attach</b> <b>the</b> boar head to the human body and did not show a human neck. However, in Badami, the problem was resolved by including a human neck. While some sculptures show a mane, it is dropped and replaced by a high conical crown - typical of Vishnu iconography - in others. Varaha sculptures generally look up to the right; there are very rare instances of left-facing Varaha depictions.|$|E
50|$|Copper bolts <b>attached</b> <b>the</b> legs to {{the base}} and <b>the</b> head was <b>attached</b> with a wooden dowel. The horns and the ears were then <b>attached</b> to <b>the</b> head.|$|R

5|$|One of the {{earliest}} works by the bard Iolo Goch was based on Tudur Hen; Iolo may have studied at the Bangor Priory. Tudur Hen's most significant legacy was his name. The naming practice {{of the time in}} Wales was to <b>attach</b> <b>the</b> father's name to the new first name, thus his son was named Goronwy ap Tudur Hen. Goronwy had children, one of whom was named Tudur, becoming another Tudur ap Goronwy. The younger Tudur was noticed by King Edward III of England and was made a knight in his service, and he was the grandfather (through Maredudd ap Tudur) of Owain ap Maredudd ap Tudur. Owain anglicised his name to become Owen Tudor, and was the grandfather of King Henry VII of England, the founder of the Royal House of Tudor.|$|E
5|$|Since so {{many new}} sets had to be created, the {{production}} commenced filming with location photography. Four days were spent in the Titan Missile Museum, south of Tucson, Arizona—the disarmed nuclear missile was fitted with a fiberglass capsule shell to stand in for the Phoenixs booster and command module. The old missile silo provided a large set that the budget would have prohibited building from scratch, but the small size created difficulties. Each camera move was planned in advance to work around areas where the lighting would be added, and electricians and grips donned rock-climbing harnesses to move down the shaft and <b>attach</b> <b>the</b> lights. To give greater dimension to the rocket and lend the missile a futuristic appearance, Leonetti chose to offset the missile's metallic surface with complementary colors. Using different-colored gels made the rocket appear longer than it actually was; to complete the effect, shots from the Phoenixs nose downwards and from the engines up were filmed with a 30mm lens to lengthen the missile.|$|E
5|$|The blacktip shark is an {{extremely}} fast, energetic predator that is usually found in groups of varying size. Segregation by sex and age does not occur; adult males and nonpregnant females are found apart from pregnant females, and both are separated from juveniles. In Terra Ceia Bay, Florida, a nursery area for this species, juvenile blacktips form aggregations {{during the day and}} disperse at night. They aggregate most strongly in the early summer when the sharks are youngest, suggesting that they are seeking refuge from predators (mostly larger sharks) in numbers. Predator avoidance may also be the reason why juvenile blacktips do not congregate in the areas of highest prey density in the bay. Adults have no known predators. Known parasites of the blacktip shark include the copepods Pandarus sinuatus and P. smithii, and the monogeneans Dermophthirius penneri and Dionchus spp., which <b>attach</b> <b>the</b> shark's skin. This species is also parasitized by nematodes in the family Philometridae, which infest the ovaries.|$|E

5|$|The cloth {{support is}} visible {{in areas where the}} paint was thinly applied. Rusty nail holes {{can be seen in the}} lower border and across the top of the picture in an area of sky that was {{initially}} covered by frame. They indicate that the woodworking was positioned much lower than Bouts had intended; generally works painted on commission were placed by professional joiners who worked independently of the painter. The low placing of the frame however protected the underlying colours over the centuries from light; they are preserved as first laid down. The panel was originally attached to its frame by pegs and nails; the nails would have been used to <b>attach</b> <b>the</b> linen to the underlying wooden frame.|$|E
5|$|The {{materials}} used in making musical instruments vary greatly by culture and application. Many of the materials have special significance owing to their source or rarity. Some cultures worked substances from the human body into their instruments. In ancient Mexico, for example, the material drums were made from might contain actual human body parts obtained from sacrificial offerings. In New Guinea, drum makers would mix human blood into the adhesive used to <b>attach</b> <b>the</b> membrane. Mulberry trees are held in high regard in China owing to their mythological significance—instrument makers would hence use them to make zithers. The Yakuts believe that making drums from trees struck by lightning gives them a special connection to nature.|$|E
5|$|The spores are spherical, and 3.5–4.5µm in diameter. They {{are covered}} with short narrow {{abruptly}} terminating projections of a translucent (hyaline) substance, which turn a pale cinnamon brown in potassium hydroxide, and a dark dull brown (nearly sepia) when stained with iodine. The capillitium is made of {{what appears to be}} encrusted cylindrical filaments 3–6µm in diameter, of a color varying from hyaline to dull yellowish brown in potassium hydroxide, and yellowish in iodine; its walls are thickened {{to the point where the}} interior (lumen) appears as only a line. Either two or four spores are attached to the basidia, and the sterigmata (extensions of the basidia that <b>attach</b> <b>the</b> spores) are long, up to 20µm. Geastrum triplex does not have cystidia.|$|E

50|$|The phrenoesophageal {{ligament}} (phrenicoesophageal ligament) is the ligament {{by which}} <b>the</b> esophagus is <b>attached</b> to <b>the</b> diaphragm. It {{is an extension}} of the inferior diaphragmatic fascia and is divided into an upper and lower limb which <b>attach</b> to <b>the</b> superior and inferior surfaces of the diaphragm respectively at the esophageal hiatus. <b>The</b> upper limb <b>attaches</b> <b>the</b> esophagus to the superior surface of the diaphragm and <b>the</b> lower limb <b>attaches</b> <b>the</b> cardia region of the stomach to the inferior surface of the diaphragm at the cardiac notch of stomach. The ligament allows independent movement of the diaphragm and esophagus during respiration and swallowing.|$|R
5|$|Casualties were {{light on}} both sides; Révolutionnaire lost five men killed and four wounded, {{including}} Thévenard {{who had suffered}} minor wounds, while Artois was the only British ship engaged, losing two sailors and a lieutenant of Royal Marines killed and five men wounded. Pellew's squadron brought Révolutionnaire back to Falmouth immediately, having discovered an outbreak of small pox among the prisoners of war taken from the French frigate. Subsequently, the light damage the ship had suffered enabled the Royal Navy to rapidly purchase and commission the frigate as the 38-gun HMS Révolutionnaire {{under the command of}} Captain Francis Cole and <b>attach</b> <b>the</b> ship to Pellew's squadron. Eighteen months later, Révolutionnaire fought and captured the French frigate Unité at the Action of 12 April 1796, and remained in the Royal Navy throughout the following 21 years of warfare. The arrival of Révolutionnaire in Britain caused a stir among naval architects as the frigate was significantly larger than those produced in Britain at the time. The ship was extensively planned and modelled and a ship was commissioned for the Royal Navy to the design of Révolutionnaire, although severe delays at the shipyards meant that HMS Forte, as the ship was eventually named, was not launched until 1814.|$|E
5|$|Exmouth {{was ordered}} on 1 November 1932 under the 1931 Naval Programme, and was laid down at Portsmouth Dockyard on 15 March 1933. She was {{launched}} on 30 January 1934, named the following day, and commissioned for service on 9 November 1934. On commissioning, Exmouth was assigned {{as leader of}} the 5th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet. The increased tensions between Italy and Abyssinia – eventually leading to the outbreak of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War – caused the Admiralty to <b>attach</b> <b>the</b> flotilla to the Mediterranean Fleet from August 1935 to March 1936, although Exmouth was refitted in Alexandria from 4 October 1935 to 5 January 1936. The ship patrolled Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War enforcing the edicts of the Non-Intervention Committee in between annual refits at Portsmouth between 17 November 1936 and 19 January 1937 and 21 November 1938 and 16 January 1939. She returned to Britain in March and Exmouth was assigned to training duties and local flotilla work based at Portsmouth on 28 April. She carried out these duties until 2 August, when she was placed into full commission {{as the leader of the}} 12th Destroyer Flotilla.|$|E
5|$|The Grenade, Hand, Anti-Tank No. 74, {{commonly}} known as the S.T. Grenade or sticky bomb, was a British hand grenade designed and produced during the Second World War. The grenade was {{one of a number of}} anti-tank weapons developed for use by the British Army and Home Guard as an ad hoc solution to a lack of sufficient anti-tank guns in the aftermath of the Dunkirk evacuation. Designed by a team from MIR(c) including Major Millis Jefferis and Stuart Macrae, the grenade consisted of a glass sphere containing an explosive made of nitroglycerin and additives (this added stability to the mix, as well as giving it its squash-head-like effect) covered in a strong adhesive and surrounded by a sheet-metal casing. When the user pulled a pin on the handle of the grenade, the casing would fall away and expose the sticky sphere. Pulling another pin would arm the firing mechanism and the user would then attempt to <b>attach</b> <b>the</b> grenade to an enemy tank or other vehicle. Letting go of the handle would release a lever that would activate a five-second fuse, which would then detonate the nitroglycerin.|$|E

50|$|The capsule is a {{soft tissue}} {{envelope}} that encircles the glenohumeral joint and <b>attaches</b> to <b>the</b> scapula, humerus, {{and head of}} the biceps. It is lined by a thin, smooth synovial membrane. This capsule is strengthened by the coracohumeral ligament which <b>attaches</b> <b>the</b> coracoid process of the scapula to the greater tubercle of the humerus. There are also three other ligaments <b>attaching</b> <b>the</b> lesser tubercle of the humerus to lateral scapula and are collectively called the glenohumeral ligaments.|$|R
