25|$|As a child, she {{was given}} a lifelike {{chimpanzee}} stuffed animal named Jubilee by her father; her fondness for the toy started her early love of animals. Today, the stuffed animal still sits on her dresser in London. As she writes in her book, Reason for Hope: “My mother’s friends were horrified by this toy, thinking it would frighten me <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> nightmares.” Goodall has a sister, Judith, who shares the same birthday, though the two were born four years apart.|$|E

500|$|The duet aria, [...] "" [...] (Take me from myself <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> to You!), {{again for}} soprano and alto, is in triple time. The tune of Johann Heermann's hymn [...] "Meinen Jesum lass ich nicht" [...] (I {{will not let}} go of my Jesus) is {{interwoven}} in the texture as a cantus firmus of the upper strings in unison. The movement is a [...] "love duet" [...] characterized by [...] "antiphonal avowals of commitment" [...] to God rather than a carnal desire. The musicologist Julian Mincham compares its presentation to Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea. The movement begins with sparse scoring and becomes more richly textured as it progresses, adding the chorale tune.|$|E

500|$|A {{few moments}} later, Tom McLaury was carried {{from the corner}} of Fremont and Third into the Harwood house on that corner, where he died without speaking. [...] Passersby carried Billy Clanton to the Harwood house, where Tom had been taken. Billy was in {{considerable}} pain and asked for a doctor and some morphine. He told those near him, [...] "They have murdered me. I have been murdered. Chase the crowd away and from the door <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> air." [...] Billy gasped for air, and someone else heard him say, [...] "Go away and let me die." [...] Ike Clanton, who had repeatedly threatened the Earps with death, was still running. William Cuddy testified that Ike passed him on Allen Street and Johnny Behan saw him a few minutes later on Toughnut Street.|$|E
500|$|I've {{had this}} idea {{in my head}} for this show Tears of a Clown which is a {{combination}} of music and storytelling.

500|$|The {{title track}} is a soca-pop song, and blends horns and {{background}} vocals with ukulele folk-pop and island percussion {{morphed into a}} programmed beat. It contains handclaps and subtle modern sound effects. Trainor uses an assertive throwback aural tone on the song. The rap verse in [...] "Title" [...] was compared to the works of Australian rapper Iggy Azalea and American duo Karmin. The song's lyrics see Trainor demanding her lover to put a name on their relationship status. It was described by the singer as [...] "call me your girlfriend, I'm sick of being your boo thing, so call me your girlfriend <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> that title". Musically, Trainor felt the song showcased what her artistic style was about, and said, [...] "I loved that 'Title' showed a little Caribbean drum before the chorus and then, like, a rap bridge that was, like… totally different sound." [...] Christina Garibaldi of MTV News wrote that the song serves a lesson for women not {{to settle for a}} friends-with-benefits relationship.|$|E

500|$|When {{he signed}} a {{professional}} football contract with the New York Giants, Timberlake stated {{that he intended to}} take ministerial training at Princeton Theological Seminary during the off-season. [...] He noted, [...] "I don't really want to play professional football, because there is no privacy and no time to be alone when you're a famous athlete." [...] He emphasized that, if he were ever forced to choose between professional football or studying for the ministry, he would give up football: [...] "I see no reason why I can't do both, but if I have to give up pro ball, I'll certainly do it." [...] Timberlake said the thing he would always remember about playing football was the 20 minutes before kickoff. [...] He recalled that those 20 minutes were [...] "horrible." [...] "You want to go home. [...] You want to quit football. [...] It is times like these when something happens to me. [...] I can't explain it. [...] I put my face in my hands and ask God to come into my heart <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> courage. He gives me peace." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Stan herself, Șerban Cazan, LeAnna James, and Naz Tokio; the {{production}} was made by Cazan. It was composed during FonoCamp 2013, the first international songwriting camp in Romania which was organized by both Fonogram and HaHaHa Studios and held in Azuga. Fellow Romanian and international singers were also present at the two-weeks event, such as Delia Matache, Mohombi, Smiley and Deepcentral. The track was mixed for HaHaHa Production and recorded at Fonogram Studios and HaHaHa Studios. In an interview in Barcelona, Spain, Stan described the song as [...] "more oriental, {{with a lot of}} spiritual meaning". She continued to explain that [...] "Give Me Your Everything" [...] was written as a present for her Arabic and Asian fans due to the song's vibe. According to Pop Shock, the track is a Caucasian-flavoured mid-tempo ballad. Lyrically, Stan tells her unidentified boyfriend not to be so hard on her, and if he really loves her, he needs to give her his everything. The chorus of [...] "Give Me Your Everything" [...] consists solely of the phrase [...] "Don't you be so hard on me / If you love me, come <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> your everything".|$|E
500|$|Saban {{was named}} {{head coach of}} the Bills for a second time in late 1971. When he arrived, Buffalo was coming off a 1–13 season, {{although}} the team had players including running back O.J. Simpson, who had run for 742 yards and five touchdowns that year. While the Bills had a 4–9–1 record, Simpson led the NFL in rushing yards in 1972. Under Saban, Simpson continued to improve in 1973, setting a single-game rushing record with 250 yards in the season opener against the New England Patriots. He surpassed the single-season rushing record later in the year with more than 2,000 yards. Before Saban's arrival, Simpson had never rushed for more than 742 yards in a season. Simpson credited Saban with helping him reach his potential. [...] "He saved my career", Simpson said in 1973, when he was named the NFL's most valuable player. [...] "He promised me he'd give me the football <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> an offensive line, and he sure kept his word." [...] The Bills had a 9–5 record that year but came in second in the AFC East and missed the playoffs.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Your Body", Aguilera sings {{of having}} a one-night stand with a random man. In the first verse, she [...] "angrily" [...] purrs, [...] "So open the box, don't need no key, I'm unlocked". Synthesizers and [...] "stuttering" [...] drums are {{featured}} at the pre-chorus, [...] "Don't even tell me your name/ All I {{need to know is}} whose place/ And let's get walking". Chris Martins of Spin commented that the lyrics actually means, [...] "The economy is in the tank, congress can't agree on anything, war and natural disasters consume us ... so, what else can we do but make love?" [...] At the second verse, she tells her lover, [...] "I am a freak, I'm disturbed/ So come on <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> your worst/ We're moving faster than slow/ If you don't know where to go/ I'll finish off on my own". The four-on-the-floor refrain has Aguilera [...] "flaunting her famous pipes" [...] on the chorus, [...] "All I wanna do is love your body/ Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it". In a track-by-track review for Lotus, Billboard critic Andrew Hampp thought that the song [...] "doesn't peak" [...] until Aguilera [...] "growls", [...] "I think you already know my name" [...] at the bridge. According to Jason Lipshutz from Billboard and Robert Cospey of Digital Spy, the lyrics of [...] "Your Body" [...] are similar to Aguilera's previous single [...] "Dirrty" [...] (2002).|$|E
2500|$|Although {{this might}} have just been dirty talk, a similar {{continuity}} error exists regarding the rank of Mack Gerhardt. In the season-one episode [...] "True Believers", his wife says to him [...] "come here sergeant major, <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a report", but his rank is later established as master sergeant. In the final wedding scene of season four, however, Mack is shown with E-7, or sergeant first class, rank on his uniform.|$|E

2500|$|While the Union Army paused, Longstreet {{reinforced}} {{his line}} {{so that there}} were four ranks of infantrymen behind the stone wall. Brig. Gen. Thomas R. R. Cobb of Georgia, who had commanded the key sector of the line, was mortally wounded by an exploding artillery shell {{and was replaced by}} Brig. Gen. Joseph B. Kershaw. General Lee expressed concerns to Longstreet about the massing troops breaking his line, but Longstreet assured his commander, [...] "General, if you put every man {{on the other side of}} the Potomac on that field to approach me over the same line, <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> plenty of ammunition, I will kill them all before they reach my line." ...|$|E
2500|$|Johnson {{then became}} {{consumed}} by the arguments George made in Progress and Poverty; read and reread it, finally requesting assistance from his business associates to find flaws in George's reasoning. [...] Johnson took the book to his lawyer and said, [...] "I must {{get out of the}} business, or prove that this book is wrong. [...] Here, Russell, is a retainer of five hundred dollars [...] I want you to read this book <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> your honest opinion on it, as you would on a legal question. Treat this retainer as you would a fee." [...] Johnson then sought out George in New York at the first possible opportunity, and the two became close friends and political collaborators. Johnson abandoned his business of rail monopoly and spent much of his fortune promoting the ideas of Henry George.|$|E
2500|$|A common {{setting for}} Friel's plays is in {{or around the}} fictional town of [...] "Ballybeg" [...] (from the Irish Baile Beag, meaning [...] "Small Town"). There are {{fourteen}} such plays: Philadelphia, Here I Come!, [...] Crystal and Fox, The Gentle Island, Living Quarters, Faith Healer, Aristocrats, Translations, The Communication Cord, Dancing at Lughnasa, Wonderful Tennessee, Molly Sweeney, Give Me Your Answer Do! and The Home Place, while the seminal event of Faith Healer {{takes place in the}} town. These plays present an extended history of this imagined community, with Translations and The Home Place set in the nineteenth century, and Dancing at Lughnasa in the 1930s. [...] With the other plays set in [...] "the present" [...] but written throughout the playwright's career from the early 1960s through the late 1990s, the audience is presented with the evolution of rural Irish society, from the isolated and backward town that Gar flees in the 1964 Philadelphia, Here I Come! to the prosperous and multicultural small city of Molly Sweeney (1994) <b>and</b> <b>Give</b> <b>Me</b> Your Answer Do! (1997), where the characters have health clubs, ethnic restaurants, and regular flights to the world's major cities.|$|E

2500|$|In his 2009 book [...] "Parkour", David Belle {{stressed}} {{that the most important}} aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. [...] "When young trainees come to see me <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better." [...] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. [...] "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: [...] "No, I am going to show you how I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1930, Davis {{moved to}} Hollywood to screen test for Universal Studios. Davis {{and her mother}} {{traveled}} by train to Hollywood and arrived on December 13, 1930. She later recounted her surprise that nobody from the studio was there to meet her at the train. [...] In fact, a studio employee had waited for her, but left because he saw nobody who [...] "looked like an actress". She failed her first screen test, but was used in several screen tests for other actors. In a 1971 interview with Dick Cavett, she related the experience with the observation, [...] "I was the most Yankee-est, most modest virgin who ever walked the earth. They laid me on a couch, and I tested fifteen men...They all had to lie {{on top of me}} <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a passionate kiss. Oh, I thought I would die. Just thought I would die." [...] A second test was arranged for Davis, for the 1931 film A House Divided. Hastily dressed in an ill-fitting costume with a low neckline, she was rebuffed by the director William Wyler, who loudly commented to the assembled crew, [...] "What do you think of these dames who show their chests and think they can get jobs?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Although the Colts {{made the}} playoffs for three {{straight}} years from 1975 to 1977, there had still been no progress made on a new park for the team. Robert Irsay first spoke with Phoenix, Arizona in 1976 and then Indianapolis, Indiana in 1977 {{about the possibility of}} relocating his team to one of those cities. In 1976, he acknowledged publicly that he had received an [...] "attractive offer" [...] to move the franchise to Phoenix, Arizona. Then, in 1977, he said, [...] "I like Baltimore and want to stay there, but {{when are we going to}} find out something about our stadium? I'm getting offers from towns like Indianapolis to build me a new stadium <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> other inducements to move there. I dont want to but I'd like to see some action in Baltimore." [...] In 1979, Hoffberger sold the Orioles to Washington D.C. attorney Edward Bennett Williams, who declared 1980 to be a trial year for the fans of Baltimore. He then went on to explain his concerns with Memorial Stadium, saying it had [...] "inadequate parking and inadequate access and egress. Frankly, I don't know if those problems will ever be solvable at that location." [...] Irsay began shopping the Colts around in earnest, talking first to officials from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission, Memphis, Tennessee, and Jacksonville, Florida where he visited the Gator Bowl packed with 50,000 cheering fans trying to convince him that Jacksonville would be the best home for the Colts. That same year Irsay presented Maryland's Governor Harry Hughes with a request for $25 million in renovation to the 64,124 seat Memorial Stadium. Irsay's request for $25 million in improvements was decreased to $23 million by the Maryland legislature. The plan added more seats (but none of the revenue-generating skyboxes), improving the plumbing and would have given both teams better office space. The plan's approval was contingent on both the Colts and Baltimore Orioles signing long term leases. The Orioles challenged the requested football improvements and refused to sign anything more than a one-year lease. Irsay also refused to sign long term. As a result, the funds and improvements never came.|$|E
