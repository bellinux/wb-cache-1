50|$|Saffire Firewire Audio Interface (2005) The Saffire Firewire {{range of}} audio {{interfaces}} marked {{a major step}} forward for Focusrite, the first being announced at NAMM in early 2005. The original Saffire, designed as a compact, portable desktop unit with vertical form factor, included a Firewire 400 interface with on-board digital signal processing, and was based around a 24-bit, 192 kHz A/D-D/A. Four inputs were provided, two Focusrite mic preamps and S/PDIF I/O. Eight balanced outputs enabled the creation of separate headphone and monitor mixes or surround-sound monitoring. MIDI I/O was also included. Along with the hardware came SaffireControl, a suite of plug-ins delivering compression, EQ, amplifier modelling, and reverb for the monitor path, along with multiple stereo mix capability, also available on playback in VST or <b>AU</b> <b>format</b> for use with the host DAW system.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Au</b> file <b>format</b> is {{a simple}} audio file format {{introduced}} by Sun Microsystems. The format was common on NeXT systems and on early Web pages. Originally it was headerless, being simply 8-bit µ-law-encoded data at an 8000 Hz sample rate. Hardware from other vendors often used sample rates as high as 8192 Hz, often integer factors of video clock signals. Newer files have a header that consists of six unsigned 32-bit words, an optional information chunk and then the data (in big endian format).|$|R

International audienceIn {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an increasing interest in improving vehicle characteristics through the use of Vehicle Control Systems (VCS). In particular, VCS for the lateral (steering) and longitudinal (velocity) dynamics are used to improve the handling properties of a vehicle. Nonetheless, the introduction of the additional elements required for implementing these control systems also increases the possibility of faults. This problem can be mitigated by using Fault Tolerant Control(FTC) systems. The most common approach for steering FTC design is based on the use of a linear Bicycle Model (BM). Using this model decentralized steering controllers can be designed. However, the BM lacks significant lateral and longitudinal cross-coupling dynamics. In fact, the steering and velocity control problem could be viewed as a multivariable cross-coupled problem. In this article VCS for the steering and velocity are designed. The resulting controllers are decentralized and capable of practically eliminating the cross-coupling. A further problem, which has not been widely reported, is the propagation of the failure of one subsystem to other subsystems. It is shown that when the Velocity Control System (VelCS) fails, then the steering subsystem has a degraded performance due to cross-coupling. The main contribution of this article consists in showing {{that it is possible to}} detect and accommodate a failure of the VelCS within the steering control system, i. e. without requiring communication among subsystems. This enables a fully independent operation even if faults occur, that is a Decentralized Fault-Tolerant Control Scheme...|$|E

50|$|More clever ways of {{digitizing}} {{an audio}} signal can reduce that waste by exploiting known {{characteristics of the}} auditory system. A classic method is nonlinear PCM, such as mu-law encoding (named after a perceptual curve in auditory perception research). Small signals are digitized with finer granularity than are large ones; the effect is to add noise that {{is proportional to the}} signal strength. Sun's <b>Au</b> file <b>format</b> for sound is a popular example of mu-law encoding. Using 8-bit mu-law encoding would cut the per-channel bitrate of CD audio down to about 350 kbit/s, or about half the standard rate. Because this simple method only minimally exploits masking effects, it produces results that are often audibly poorer than the original.|$|R

40|$|Il s’agit dans cet article de montrer comment et pourquoi l’arène médiatique s’est progressivement faite l’instrument de légitimation d’une loi dans l’espace public français, de mars 2003 à mars 2004, afin d’interdire le port du voile à l’école (promulgation d’une loi le 15 mars 2004). L’analyse d’un corpus presse et audiovisuel assez large (Le Figaro, Le Monde, La Croix, L’Humanité, AFP, chaînes de télévision hertziennes) confrontée aux paroles d’acteurs qui ont produit l’information a permis de mettre au jour la chronologie de l’événement médiatique, de repérer les acteurs mis en scène ou non, leurs registres d’argumentation avec, en particulier, l’émergence d’un définisseur {{primaire}} prééminent, la commission Stasi, alors chargée par le président de la République d’organiser le débat national sur la laïcité. Ce processus facilite la mise à distance des logiques de dénonciation du rôle des médias, en montrant l’importance des « routines » journalistiques dans le traitement de la question, en particulier la dépendance aux sources et <b>aux</b> <b>formats</b> de production de l’information. L’approfondissement de deux cas très différents, ceux du journal d’opinion L’Humanité et de l’Agence France Presse (AFP), vient étayer cette démonstration. The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the huge media controversy that led to the parliamentary vote of March 15 th, 2004, banning from schools all signs that “clearly show” a religious affiliation. The purpose was to forbid young Muslim girls from wearing headscarves. The role of media as “law makers” is discussed, showing for instance the variety of treatments among the different media. Key issues regarding the journalistic practices during the period are the way they chose their sources among people wanting the law, and the way they treated the information following journalistic “format. ” Concerning the question of sources, many of the same feminist and laic arguments were heard whereas people against a law defending liberty of conscience and education rights did not have access to the media. Furthermore, the article shows how the Stasi Commission on laïcité, appointed by President Chirac in July 2003 to report on issues associated with laïcité, became the primary definer of topics leading to a law. The concept of “format” and its determining role in media coverage is illustrated with two cases. First, the way the French Press Agency (AFP) simplified the debate choosing “prolaw” or “antilaw” actors without any other alternative viewpoint. The second case deals with the political newspaper L’Humanité, which was very uncomfortable with the debate and which, most unusually, preferred not to take sides in this case. This research is based on a media corpus analysis (mainly newspapers and television). It uses the “Alceste” statistical software to investigate newspaper coverage, and a qualitative analysis of television and interviews with journalists and Stasi Commission members involved in the process...|$|R
40|$|Although	modern	software-based	DA Ws	(Digital	Audio Workstations) {{offer the}} ability to {{interconnect}} with plug-in effects, they can be restrictive due to their architecture being largely based on hardware mixing desks. This is especially true when complex multi-effect sound design is required. This paper aims to demonstrate how a plug-in that can host other effects plug-ins can help improve the sound design possibilities in a DAW. This hosting plug-in allows other effects to be “inserted” at specific points in its internal signal flow. Details are given of a “proof of concept” plug-in that was created to demonstrate {{that it was possible}} to create plug-ins that can host other plug-ins, using Apple’s <b>AU</b> (Audio Unit) <b>format.</b> The proof of concept is a delay effect that allows other effects plug-ins to be inserted in either the “delay path”, “feedback path” or both.

Finally, details are given of how improvements can be made to the plug-in hosting delay...|$|R
