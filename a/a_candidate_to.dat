Stickland {{identified}} {{this system}} as <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>to</b> {{evolve into a}} Type Ia supernova or a cataclysmic variable. At a distance of 150light years, this makes it the nearest known candidate supernova progenitor to the Earth.

5|$|Means (Kristen Cloke) is a {{forensic}} psychologist and <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>to</b> join the Millennium Group. Like Black, Means has a nearly-supernatural insight into criminal cases (which she attributes to a guardian angel). When Means {{is prepared for}} initiation into the group the angelic presence forsakes her, leading to a mental breakdown as she shelters herself from the viral outbreak orchestrated by the group. Means gives Catherine Black her vaccine dose, which she uses to inoculate her daughter Jordan.|$|E
5|$|After the 2014 season, Banister interviewed {{with the}} Houston Astros as <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>to</b> fill their {{managing}} vacancy, following {{the firing of}} Bo Porter. The Astros instead hired A. J. Hinch. He also interviewed with the Texas Rangers, and was {{a finalist for the}} position along with Rangers' interim manager Tim Bogar and pitching coach Mike Maddux. On October 16, 2014, the Rangers named Banister their new manager. He signed a three-year contract with an option for a fourth season. Jon Daniels, the Rangers' general manager, indicated that Banister will help the Rangers to incorporate analytics into their baseball decisions.|$|E

He appeared in all nine games for the team, and recorded one assist, {{in a game against}} France, as the Americans finished fourth overall. During the 2009–10 season he was mentioned as <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>to</b> join the American team at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, but a wrist and thumb injury led to a decrease in performance and he was ultimately not selected. He was invited to join the American team at the 2010 IIHF World Championship, but declined in order to heal his injuries.|$|E
5|$|Boniface and his {{elder brother}} Amadeus IV, Count of Savoy, were sons of Thomas I, Count of Savoy, and Margaret of Geneva. He is thus {{not to be}} {{confused}} with his nephew, and fellow member of the House of Savoy, Count Boniface of Savoy, the son of Amadeus IV. The elder Boniface was born about 1207 in Savoy. He was the eleventh child of his parents. Some sources state that at a young age he joined the Carthusian Order. However, there is no evidence of this, and it would have been very unusual for a nobleman to enter that order with its very strict discipline. He also had a brother Peter of Savoy who was named Earl of Richmond in 1240 and yet another brother William of Savoy, who was Bishop of Valence and <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>to</b> be Bishop of Winchester in England.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Eccleston was {{the only}} one of the four lead actors who was already an {{established}} television face, having previously co-starred in the ITV crime drama series Cracker. Eccleston first heard about the project while working with Danny Boyle on the film Shallow Grave in the autumn of 1993. Initially, Eccleston had been considered by the production team as <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>to</b> play Geordie, but he was more interested in playing Nicky, who he saw as a more emotionally complex character. Eccleston was particularly concerned about being able to successfully perform with the Newcastle Geordie accent. He did not even attempt the accent at his audition, concentrating instead on characterisation. He drew inspiration for his performance as the older Nicky from Peter Flannery himself, basing aspects of his characterisation on Flannery's personality. He even wore some of the writer's own colourful shirts.|$|E

5|$|Clements {{began his}} {{campaign}} for re-election in 1956 by defeating Joe Bates, the candidate favored by Chandler, in the Democratic senatorial primary. On April 30, 1956, Kentucky senator Alben Barkley died suddenly of a heart attack. With the Democratic primary already over, the Democratic State Central Committee was charged with selecting <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>to</b> run for Barkley's seat. They chose Wetherby, Clements' former lieutenant governor. Journalist John Ed Pearce later recorded that Clements had favored Chandler's choice, Joseph Leary, as a candidate rather than Wetherby. Clements didn't think Leary {{had a very good}} chance of winning, but he felt Leary's selection would keep Chandler from throwing his support to the Republican candidates.|$|E
5|$|Despite heavy loss of form, {{which also}} saw the team fall outside the top ten in the FIFA rankings, Croatia {{were placed in the}} top tier of teams for the UEFA Euro 2012 {{qualifying}} draw; Croatia was previously <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>to</b> co-host the tournament with Hungary which would have allowed the team to qualify automatically, but UEFA eventually chose Poland and Ukraine as hosts instead. Despite being top-seeds in their qualifying group, Croatia finished second behind Greece, settling for a play-off against Euro 2008 rivals Turkey. Croatia proceeded to beat Turkey 3–0 on aggregate, with all three goals coming in the away leg in Istanbul, thereby qualifying for the 2012 European championship. In the proceeding group-stage draw for the tournament, Croatia were placed in the third tier of teams, and were eventually grouped with Ireland, Italy and defending champions Spain.|$|E
5|$|Despite lack of run support {{contributing}} to a poor win-loss record, Hamels was among the best pitchers in the National League, and was even mentioned as a Cy Young candidate. On September 1, Hamels pitched six innings of a Phillies combined no-hitter against the Atlanta Braves. Hamels was pulled for a pinch hitter {{in the top of}} the seventh due to having five walks, a hit-batter, and 108 pitches through six innings. Overall, Hamels was the only consistent star on the Phillies, finished sixth in Cy Young voting, and was frequently mentioned as <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>to</b> be traded in the offseason to bolster the Phillies' lackluster farm system, after he avoided being dealt at the July trading deadline.|$|E

5|$|Dewhurst {{occasionally}} captained Trinidad in the Inter-Colonial Tournament and was <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>to</b> captain the West Indies cricket team in England in 1928, {{when the}} two most likely men were {{unwilling or unable to}} lead the team. Dewhurst had acted as vice-captain of the West Indies team in 1926 to Harold Austin, but in the event, Karl Nunes was selected as captain. Dewhurst was also overlooked as vice-captain in favour of Vibart Wight although the latter had no captaincy experience. Dewhurst was named in the team to tour England, but he withdrew. Some newspaper reports blamed illness for his decision, others suggested business reasons. Critics believed that Dewhurst's absence adversely affected the team; the replacement wicket-keepers were not regarded as equal to Dewhurst's ability, and the vice-captain had little success. It was suggested that Dewhurst only missed the tour because he had not been chosen as vice-captain.|$|E
5|$|Miyuki is {{considered}} one of the strongest magicians in the world and is <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>to</b> succeed the Yotsuba. Her specialty is freezing magic, and her unique magic allows her to freeze a person's consciousness. In addition, half of her magic casting abilities is used to seal Tatsuya's powers. Before the family vacation in Okinawa, Miyuki treated Tatsuya coldly akin to how the other Yotsuba clan members did. She begins to warm up to him and when Tatsuya saves her life, devotes her existence to him. It evolves to the point she disdains the touch of other males and expresses jealousy towards females around Tatsuya. Genetically different from Tatsuya, despite being born from the same parents, Miyuki professes her love to him following their engagement under Maya's orders. She is voiced by Saori Hayami.|$|E
5|$|Phaneuf {{established}} himself as the junior hockey team's top player following the draft, earning the Bill Hunter Memorial Trophy as the top defenceman in the WHL. He was also named an Eastern Conference All-Star by the WHL, and a First Team All-Star by the Canadian Hockey League (CHL). He was considered <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>to</b> join the Flames in 2004. The 2004–05 NHL lock-out, however, forced Phaneuf to play one final year of junior hockey. He scored 56 points in 55 games to finish his junior career with 146 total points. He repeated as the WHL's Defenceman of the Year, and was again named to both WHL and CHL All-Star Teams. Prospects Hockey rated Phaneuf as the top player in the CHL in both 2004 and 2005, ahead of Sidney Crosby, naming {{him one of the}} best junior defencemen of the previous decade.|$|E

5|$|Scott {{was one of}} 37 men {{who founded}} the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge in 1787. Although he did not {{participate}} in any of the ten statehood conventions that sought to separate Kentucky from Virginia, he supported the idea in principle. When Woodford County was formed from the part of Fayette County that included Scott's fledgling settlement, Scott declined appointment as the new county's lieutenant. He did, however, consent to be <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>to</b> represent the county in the Virginia House of Delegates. During his single term, he served on the committee on privileges and election and on several special committees, including one that recommended that President George Washington supply a military guard at Big Bone Lick to facilitate the establishment of a saltworks there.|$|E

In 1917, with the United States entering World War I, she began a long association with the Red Cross. From 1917 to 1922 she worked in Europe, including time spent as {{the chief of the}} casualty division in Paris, France.
