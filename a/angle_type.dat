30|$|In the AISC-ASD specifications, top- and seat-angle {{connections}} {{are treated as}} connections intended only for transferring beam shear force. However, experimental evidence and the present study on the connections show that besides transferring beam shear force, this type of connection transfers fairly considerable beam end moment to the column. When transferring this moment through the top angle to the column, an increase in tensile force is incurred in the bolts due to local deformation of the top angle’s vertical leg. This additional tensile force {{is commonly known as}} the prying force (Q in Fig.  4). Recently, researchers have paid serious attention to this additional force in their mathematical representation of connection behavior. Initially, the T-stub modeling concept has been used for designing extended end plate connections and modified for use to design <b>angle</b> <b>type</b> of connections (Faella et al. 1996; CEN 1997).

Average acromial tilt angle was 34. 1 ° (SD 7. 6) for SIS group and 32. 1 ° (SD 7. 7) for control group. Type II acromion was found more frequent in both groups (85 % and 95 %). The association between SIS and acromial tilt angle or between SIS and type of acromion were statistically insignificant (p= 0. 241 and p= 0. 221).

Samples were collected from seventeen stratigraphic sections spanning the calciturbidities of the Yosunlukbayırı Formation and pelagic micrites of the Soğukçam Limestone. Because of rareness and difficulties for extracting of calcareous nannofossil species particularly zone markers in these type lithologies, nannoconids have particular attention in terms of biostratigraphy. Twenty nine species of nannoconids were recorded in the studied samples. Their taxonomy were revised and their stratigraphic ranges were given. The classification of genus Nannoconus {{is based on the}} gross morphology of the test, presence of central cavity or central canal, proportion of central cavity to thickness of the wall, proportion of height to width. Thickness of calcite elements, degree of horizontal intercept <b>angle,</b> <b>type</b> of apertures and degree of horizontal intercept <b>angle,</b> <b>type</b> of apertures, and degree of angle of apertural elements are also used for description of the species. Fluctuations in nannoconid abundance are related to lithological changes. High abundance of nannoconids in limestones indicates clear surface water palaeoenvironments without terrigenous influx. From the stratigraphical point of view, their importance was clarified by their high abundance peaks. Problematic zonal boundaries of the nannofossil zonation could be determined by major nannoconid bioevents...|$|E

30|$|Semi-rigid {{connections}} are receiving considerable {{interest in the}} research community because of their easy installation in steel frames and energy-dissipating capability under reversal loading (Elnashi et al. 1998; Shen and Astaneh-Asl 1999; Garlock et al. 2003; Pirmoz 2006; Cheol and Young 2007). Understanding the viability of these connections in practice, AISC (2001, 2010) adopted top- and seat-angle connections into the design specifications to transfer only the beam-shear force to the column. However, experimental evidences and the author’s past studies on the connections exposed that besides transferring beam-shear force, this type of connections transferred fairly significant beam-end-moment to the column. When transferring the moment through the top angle to the column, an increase in tensile force occurred in the bolts due to local deformation of the top angle’s vertical leg. This additional tensile force {{is commonly known as}} prying force. A few researchers have paid serious attention to this additional force in their mathematical representation of connection behaviour. The most recent stiffness modelling technique that includes individual elements behaviour reformed in equivalent T-stub connection model for both extended end plate connections and <b>angle</b> <b>type</b> of connections following the modelling technique of Weynand et al.

However, the T-stub model is somehow different in respect to interaction with the actual deformation pattern of true <b>angle</b> <b>type</b> of connections at failure and may loose its efficiency in estimation of connection strength. So, precise understanding about interaction among connection components on moment–rotation behaviour is required to represent a straightforward and accurate mechanical model of the connection.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the numerical {{study of the}} turbulent swirling flow in a combustor {{and the effect of}} cooling air, which has practical applications in industrial furnaces and jet engines. Cooling air is used to protect the combustor wall from burnout, while allowing the combustion to occur at higher temperature. The governing differential equations using k – ε turbulence model closure are solved by a control-volume based iterative finite difference technique. Computations are done for constant vane <b>angle</b> <b>type</b> swirl generation at inlet. Different swirl numbers up to 1. 5 are considered. To study the effect of cooling air on the combustor performance, calculations are repeated for two different velocities of the cooling air jet. The predicted distribution of the mean axial and tangential velocities, turbulence kinetic energy and streamline plots are discussed in the article. With the increase of swirl strength, secondary on-axis recirculation due to swirl is observed. The swirl produces larger turbulence kinetic energy and enhances mixing rate, thus require shorter combustor length. The interaction between the non-swirling cooling air and swirling core flow also increases the generation of turbulence kinetic energy and mixing rate. The capability of the computational model for predicting recirculating flows is tested by comparing the results with available experimental data and found to have reasonable matching...|$|E
