5|$|Romney Classical Institute was a 19th-century coeducational collegiate preparatory {{school in}} Romney, Virginia (present-day West Virginia), {{which was in}} {{operation}} between 1846 and some time after 1866. Prior to its establishment, Romney was served by Romney Academy. By 1831, the academy had outgrown its facilities, and the Romney Literary Society set <b>about</b> <b>raising</b> the necessary funds {{for the construction of}} a new educational building. The Virginia General Assembly permitted the society to raise funds through a lottery. By 1845 construction of the building had commenced and was completed in 1846. On December 12, 1846, the Virginia General Assembly formally established the Romney Classical Institute, and empowered the Romney Literary Society with its operation.|$|E

In the spring and summer, Agnes and Gebhard did likewise, traveling to different parts of the electorate, raising an army, and extending the Protestant cause. By October, Ernst's brother Ferdinand entered the electorate from the south, near Koblenz. In their northward progress, they left a path of fire and destruction. Agnes and Gebhard fled, as Poppelsdorf, then Godesberg, and later the capital city of the electorate, Bonn, were over-run and destroyed.|$|E

5|$|When John's {{elder brother}} Richard became king in September 1189, {{he had already}} {{declared}} his intention of joining the Third Crusade. Richard set <b>about</b> <b>raising</b> the huge sums of money required for this expedition through the sale of lands, titles and appointments, and attempted to ensure {{that he would not}} face a revolt while away from his empire. John was made Count of Mortain, was married to the wealthy Isabel of Gloucester, and was given valuable lands in Lancaster and the counties of Cornwall, Derby, Devon, Dorset, Nottingham and Somerset, all with the aim of buying his loyalty to Richard whilst the king was on crusade. Richard retained royal control of key castles in these counties, thereby preventing John from accumulating too much military and political power, and, for the time being, the king named the four-year-old Arthur of Brittany as the heir to the throne. In return, John promised not to visit England for the next three years, thereby in theory giving Richard adequate time to conduct a successful crusade and return from the Levant without fear of John seizing power. Richard left political authority in England – the post of justiciar – jointly in the hands of Bishop Hugh de Puiset and William Mandeville, and made William Longchamp, the Bishop of Ely, his chancellor. Mandeville immediately died, and Longchamp took over as joint justiciar with Puiset, which would prove a less than satisfactory partnership. Eleanor, the queen mother, convinced Richard to allow John into England in his absence.|$|E

Still perplexed by Richie, she talks with him at times, her concern more directed at {{the fact that he has}} leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant to survive. His sister, Annie, is thought to be the best candidate to be his donor, and Babe is determined to convince her to save him. But her efforts are revealed hopeless when test results show that Annie is not a good donor match for Richie after all. The revelation comes that someone else in Pine Valley is the perfect bone marrow match for Richie. With the help of her mother, Babe discovers that JR is the match. Feeling that he will not donate the bone marrow on his own due to his hate for Richie, she decides to entice JR during a runway where she wears a sexy red dress. Once she gets his attention, she propositions him with a game of strip poker. If she wins, he will have to save Richie's life. If JR wins, he can have anything he wants in regards to her.

But he surprises Babe with the news that he already knew he was a match for Richie, and that he was already going to help him. Babe is intrigued by this new, softer side of JR, and JR mentions to Babe how they both want each other. They embrace, and the two make love.|$|E
