40|$|To gather {{information}} on the interactions between the sediment and suspended organic matter pools in the Stagnone di Marsala, water and sediment samples were collected, on a monthly basis, at 11 stations. Water temperature and salinity showed a clear seasonality whilst particulate and sediment organic matter did not show any clear seasonal pattern. Relative abundances of suspended and sediment organic matter, on the other hand, appeared to be site-dependent and controlled mainly by the dynamic balance between resuspension and sedimentation. High quantities of both suspended and sediment total organic matter were present, while very low <b>algal</b> <b>biomasses</b> (in terms of chlorophyll-a concentrations) were observed both in the suspended and sediment pools thus showing the oligotrophy of the site. The contribution of phytoplankton and microphytobenthos to the total organic content of suspended and sediment matter was negligible.

40|$|The {{processes}} which {{control the}} growth, composition, succession and loss from suspension of phytoplankton algae are briefly reviewed, with special reference {{to function in}} eutrophic reservoir systems. The ecology of larger <b>algal</b> <b>biomasses</b> supported by high nutrient loading rates {{are more likely to}} be subject to physical (wash-out, underwater light penetration, thermal stability and mixing) than to chemical constraints. Sudden changes in the interactions between physical factors temporarily impair the growth of dominant algal species, and advance the succession. Certain algae may be cropped heavily, but selectively, by zooplankton feeding, but they are rarely the species which cause problems in waterworks practice. Grazing, however, does influence succession. A deeper understanding of the operation of loss control mechanism is urgently required. Potentially, manipulation of the physical environment provides an important means of alleviating day-to-day algal problems in eutrophic reservoirs; in terms of cost effectiveness these may prove to be more attractive than reducing nutrient loads at source...|$|R
30|$|Lipid-producing microalgae {{have the}} {{potential}} to permit lipid accumulation without demanding for arable land. Under favorable growth conditions, <b>algal</b> <b>biomasses</b> are successfully produced with relatively low lipid contents. Optimization of biomass and lipid in microalgae has been studied in batch, closed and open outdoor systems (Zou and Richmond [2000]; Sandnes et al. [2005]; Grobbelaar [2007]). In those culture systems, the environmental parameters and nutrient supply were found to be vital factors for growth improvement and induction of lipid in microalgae. Accordingly high lipid productivity which is a main requirement for commercial production of microalgal oil-derived biodiesel was achieved (Sharma et al. [2012]). However, increase in lipid productivity (mass of lipids per unit of area per unit of time) can be achieved by either enhancement the rate of biomass accumulation, or increase the biomass with high lipid percent on the basis of dry weight. To attain this goal, different approaches including nutrient starvation, bioprocess optimization and genetic engineering can be used (Hu et al. [2008]). However, the maximum yield will be obtained by the algal response to the surroundings.|$|R

The changes in oxygenation are considered consistent with measurements of higher <b>algal</b> <b>biomass</b> and productivity.

40|$|A {{new model}} has been {{developed}} for assessing the effects of multiple sources of phosphorus on the water quality and aquatic ecology in heterogeneous river systems. The Integrated Catchments model for Phosphorus (INCA-P) is a process-based, mass balance model that simulates the phosphorus dynamics in both the plant/soil system and the stream. The model simulates the spatial variations in phosphorus export from different land use types within a river system using a semi-distributed representation, thereby accounting for the impacts of different land management practices, such as organic and inorganic fertiliser and wastewater applications. The land phase of INCA-P includes a simplified representation of direct runoff, soilwater and groundwater flows, and the soil processes that involve phosphorus. In addition, the model includes a multi-reach in-stream component that routes water down the main river channel. It simulates Organic and Inorganic Phosphorus concentrations in the land phase, and Total Phosphorus (dissolved plus particulate phosphorus) concentrations in the in-stream phase. In-stream Soluble Reactive Phosphorus concentrations are determined from the Total Phosphorus concentrations and the macrophyte, epiphyte and <b>algal</b> <b>biomasses</b> are simulated also.

Nutrient content and turbulence in enclosures of 27 m 3 natural sea water were manipulated in situ in order to generate blooms dominated by diatoms and flagellate-microzooplankton respectively. The diatom-dominated mesocosms reached the highest <b>algal</b> <b>biomasses.</b> Calanus helgolandicus generally preferred non-diatom food, such as ciliates and metazoans, and showed similar ingestion rates in both systems. The female body-carbon-specific nauplii production was highest (10. 6 % d– 1) during a flagellate-microzooplankton bloom, before it dropped to ca 1. 7 % d– 1 during a bloom of Dictyocha speculum. In the diatomdominated water it dropped to as low as 0. 1 %, and was always < 5. 2 % d– 1. The total standing stock of calanoid copepods increased about 2. 6 times more in the flagellate-microzooplankton-dominated mesocosms. The drop in reproductive success in diatom-dominated water was recorded when feeding rates were high, and ciliates and other prey made up a substantial part of the diet. This suggests that either all prey, including the ciliates, were of poor quality and/or that inhibitory components may be an important factor during diatom blooms, even when significant amounts of alternative prey are available.

The responses of diatomcommunities to toxic stress in streamwater are disturbed by the variations of environmental parameters. In this study, periphytic algae collected in situwere exposed under controlled conditions to two major herbicides used in French agriculture (isoproturon and s-metolachlor). Three exposure regimes were tested: 5 and 30 gL− 1 for 6 days and 30 gL− 1 for 3 days followed by a recovery period of 3 days. The <b>algal</b> <b>biomasses</b> were assessed from pigment concentrations (chlorophyll a and c) and from live cell density. The highest concentration (30 gL− 1) of isoproturon inhibited the biomass increase statistically significantly. In periphyton exposed to 5 and 30 gL− 1 of s-metolachlor, chlorophyll c concentration and live cell densitywere also statistically significantly lower than in the control. Periphyton left to recover after reduced exposure duration (3 days) showed higher growth rates after treatment with s-metolachlor than with isoproturon. Taxonomic identifications showed that species like Melosira varians, Nitzschia dissipata and Cocconeis placentula were not affected by the herbicide exposure. Other species like Eolimna minima and Navicula reichardtiana were more sensitive. Studying diatoms according to their trophic mode showed that facultative heterotroph specieswere statistically significantly favoured by isoproturon exposure at the highest concentration.

40|$|The {{eutrophication}} and algal blooms {{are problems}} in many Finnish lakes and sea areas. One possible {{way to approach}} the problem is mathematical modelling. If the most important processes have been successfully modelled, {{it is easy to}} calculate the effects of nutrient load changes. This thesis presents experiences on developing and applying eutrophication models. The pre-calculated flow fields are the most important input to the water quality model, so the applications of the flow model are examined in two papers. The results indicate that the flow model can produce typical flows caused by wind. The simulations of the timing of upwelling were also successful. The excessive vertical diffusion can cause problems in eutrophication model applications. The results of simulations indicate that the greenhouse effect will advance and enlarge the spring bloom of phytoplankton. However, the average phytoplankton biomass in the Gulf of Finland will be near current level, defined in these scenarios by the available amount of nutrients almost unchanged due to the insignificant changes in the external nutrient inputs. The more significant nutrient load reductions from the major loading points have a clearly decreasing effect on the total <b>algal</b> <b>biomasses</b> even in one year long simulations.

Dunaliella salina, Oocystis sp., Porphyridium cruentum, and Scenedesmus protuberans were shown to be good candidates for the sorption/removal of the metals from waters prior to atomic spectrometric determination. Characterization of the algae was carried out by scanning electron microscopy, FTIR, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis. All biomasses behaved similarly in the optimization of sorption parameters. Solution pH of 6. 0, sorbent amount of 10. 0 mg for 10. 0 mL sample volume, shaking time of 60 min, and reaction temperature of 25 C were used in the sorption experiments. It was demonstrated that the primary sorption mechanism is the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged functional groups {{on the surface of the}} biomass and the positively (+ 2) charged metal ions in the solution. Among the biomasses investigated, Dunaliella salina has shown the highest sorption capacity for all the metal ions. It was followed by Oocystis sp., Scenedesmus protuberans and Porphyridium cruentum.

A coupling between phytoplankton and bacterial production is well documented in mid-to low-latitude oceans (e. g., Bird and Kalff 1984; Cole, Findlay and Pace 1988) and is thought to result from the heterotrophic uptake of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) released by the primary producers (i. e. the "microbial loop;" Pomeroy 1974; Bjørnsen 1988).
