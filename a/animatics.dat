5|$|The entire {{movie was}} sketched out via {{hand-drawn}} storyboards and then re-created as computer-generated 3D <b>animatics</b> {{with all of}} the 2D background photographs digitally painted to resemble the 1939 setting. With the <b>animatics</b> as a guide, grids were created to map camera and actor movements with digital characters standing in for the real actors. The grids were made into actual maps on the blue screen stage floor to help the actors move around invisible scenery.|$|E

5|$|The DVD boxset for season one was {{released}} by 20th Century Fox in the United States and Canada in September 2001, eleven years after it had completed broadcast on television. As well as every episode from the season, the DVD release features bonus material including deleted scenes, <b>Animatics,</b> and commentaries for every episode.|$|E
50|$|Often, an <b>animatic</b> or story reel is {{made after}} the soundtrack is created, but before full {{animation}} begins. An <b>animatic</b> typically consists {{of pictures of}} the storyboard synchronized with the soundtrack. This allows the animators and directors to work out any script and timing issues that may exist with the current storyboard. The storyboard and soundtrack are amended if necessary, and a new <b>animatic</b> may be created and reviewed with the director until the storyboard is perfected. Editing the film at the <b>animatic</b> stage prevents the animation of scenes that would be edited out of the film; as traditional animation is a very expensive and time-consuming process, creating scenes that will eventually be edited out of the completed cartoon is strictly avoided.|$|R

50|$|When voice {{samples and}} the sound track are available, it is {{possible}} to create a digital <b>animatic</b> by exporting all the samples together and playing them on QuickTime after synchronising them, or by making a different <b>animatic</b> using the software already used to create the storyboard.|$|R
5|$|Additions {{to the end}} musical number, {{including}} visual gags such as Bob {{appearing in}} uniform, were added after the <b>animatics.</b> The crew felt that watching the character singing would not be interesting enough {{and they had to}} include these gags to make it work. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening was surprised when he saw the additions, because he originally thought they were silly and would not appear in the final cut, but he has grown to like them.|$|E
5|$|The DVD boxset for season five was {{released}} by 20th Century Fox in the United States and Canada on December 21, 2004, ten years after it had completed broadcast on television. As well as every episode from the season, the DVD release features bonus material including deleted scenes, <b>animatics,</b> and commentaries for every episode. The menus are a different format than the previous seasons, and that format would be used in every set after.|$|E

5|$|The film advising company Warriors Inc. was enlisted {{to ensure}} the war scenes, {{including}} the attire worn by the actors, looked authentic. Former members of the U.S. military taught the actors how to handle, fire, and reload their weapons, as well as perform various tactical movements. The opening war scene was filmed over three weeks and required fifty stuntmen. <b>Animatics</b> were used to map out the necessary camera angles for filming.|$|E
5|$|To {{reduce the}} optical effects workload, Ferren {{rejected}} bluescreen compositing, opting instead for rear projection. This cheaper process, he reasoned, would save time, {{and would make}} sense for elements such as the Enterprises bridge viewer, where compositing would lack the softness of a real transmitted image. Designer Lynda Weinman used a Mac II to create the <b>animatics</b> cut into the film during production, which were eventually replaced by the film's finished effects.|$|E
5|$|The {{animated}} miniseries {{was released}} on DVD in the United States on September 8, 2015 from Cartoon Network and Warner Home Video. The DVD release took place two months earlier on July 8 in Australia. The DVD features all ten episodes of the show, commentaries, the original pilot, alternate title cards, and deleted <b>animatics.</b> Other extras on the DVD include the Composer's Cut, an option wherein a viewer can watch the show with only the visuals and the background music; and the mini-documentary Behind Over the Garden Wall.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} {{staff at}} the U.S. animation studio, Film Roman, draws storyboards, designs new characters, backgrounds, props and draws character and background layouts, which in turn become <b>animatics</b> to be screened for the writers at Gracie Films for any changes to be made before the work is shipped overseas. The overseas studios then draw the inbetweens, ink and paint, and render the animation to tape before it is shipped back to the United States to be delivered to Fox {{three to four months}} later.|$|E
5|$|The show's {{style of}} {{animation}} {{is inspired by}} the paper cut-out cartoons made by Terry Gilliam for Monty Python's Flying Circus, of which Parker and Stone have been lifelong fans. Construction paper and traditional stop motion cutout animation techniques {{were used in the}} original animated shorts and in the pilot episode. Subsequent episodes have been produced by computer animation, providing a similar look to the originals while requiring a fraction of the time to produce. Before computer artists begin animating an episode, a series of <b>animatics</b> drawn in Toon Boom are provided by the show's storyboard artists.|$|E
5|$|Unable to find wind {{machines}} {{powerful enough}} to mimic hurricane-force winds, Sertner brought in a jet engine to aim at the actors and props during necessary scenes. Three dimensional storyboards, called <b>animatics,</b> were used to allow the filmmakers {{to see what a}} scene would look like before shooting, using a digital version of the actors. The various weather scenes blended together stock footage of real natural disasters with the computer-generated shots, with care taken to match up the details of the various scenes.|$|E

50|$|The {{writers of}} the film, Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, also wrote the {{screenplay}} for The Hangover. The director, Rob Minkoff, {{is well known for}} co-directing The Lion King.Filming took place in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in June 2010. The opening <b>animatic</b> sequence was created by Geefwee Boedoe. Boedoe had been planning to fully animate the sequence, but due to budget and because Minkoff enjoyed the <b>animatic</b> so much, he decided to use that in the final product.|$|R
5|$|Ten {{months before}} Conran made the movie with his actors, he shot it entirely with stand-ins in Los Angeles and then created the whole movie in <b>animatics</b> {{so that the}} actors had {{an idea of what}} the film would look like and where to move on the soundstage. To prepare for the film, Conran had his cast watch old movies, such as Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not (1944) for Paltrow's {{performance}} and The Thin Man (1934) for the relationship between Nick and Nora that was to be echoed in the one between Joe and Polly. Avnet constantly pushed for room in this meticulously designed movie for the kind of freedom the actors needed, like being able to move around on the soundstage.|$|E
5|$|The stunt {{crew was}} the same one used in Cruise's Mission: Impossible 2, and was {{responsible}} for complex action scenes. These included the auto factory chase scene, filmed in a real facility using props such as a welding robot, and the fight between Anderton and the jetpack-clad officers, filmed in an alley set built on the Warner Bros. studio lot. Industrial Light & Magic {{did most of the}} special effects, and DreamWorks-owned PDI was responsible for the Spyder robots. The company Pixel Liberation Front did previsualization <b>animatics.</b> The holographic projections and the prison facility were filmed by several roving cameras which surrounded the actors, and the scene where Anderton gets off his car and runs along the Maglev vehicles was filmed on stationary props, which were later replaced by computer-generated vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the first}} scene filmed was the final scene {{to appear in the}} film (shot during the filming of Attack of the Clones in 2000), {{principal}} photography on the film occurred from June 30, 2003 to September 17, 2003, with additional photography occurring at Shepperton Studios and Elstree Studios in London from August 2004 to January 31, 2005. The initial filming took place on sound stages at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, although practical environments were shot as background footage later to be composited into the film. These included the limestone mountains depicting Kashyyyk, which were filmed in Phuket, Thailand (they were later damaged by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami). The production company was also fortunate enough to be shooting {{at the same time that}} Mount Etna erupted in Italy. Camera crews were sent to the location to shoot several angles of the volcano that were later spliced into the background of the <b>animatics</b> and the final film version of the planet Mustafar.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the issues involved}} {{with the introduction of}} the storyboard and the <b>animatic</b> in a design studio exercise. Storyboards - sketches used in film planning -, and the <b>animatic</b> - basically a moving storyboard - allow the student to understand space within {{in the context of a}} narrative. The purpose of the exercise was to enable the expression of subjectively experienced space in an early stage of urban context analysis. Differently than the traditional approach to animation which results a camera traveling through a path, the exercise approached animation from the perspective of the stories about the place...|$|R

5|$|Elements of {{the zero}} gravity scenes were handled by Pacific Data Images, while phaser beams and {{transporter}} effects were generated by Visual Concept Engineering, {{an offshoot of}} ILM that had contributed to The Wrath of Khan and The Final Frontier. Despite the overall count of effects shots being dropped from over 100 to 51, the project was still large, and required virtually the entire ILM staff to complete. Farrar's goal was to economize the remaining effects; if three shots were similar, {{they would try to}} tell the story with only one. Cheap <b>animatics</b> provided Meyer with placeholders to cut into the film and avoid costly surprises. Stock footage from previous films were used whenever possible, but it was often unfeasible to do so; as the original USS Enterprise had been destroyed in , all shots of the USS Enterprise-A had to feature the updated ship registry.|$|E
