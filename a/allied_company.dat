Jacobs (then 1st Lt.), Infantry, distinguished himself while serving as assistant battalion advisor, 2d Battalion, 16th Infantry, 9th Infantry Division, Army [...] of the Republic of Vietnam. The 2d Battalion was advancing to contact when it came under intense heavy machine gun and mortar fire from a Viet Cong battalion positioned in well fortified bunkers. As the 2d Battalion deployed into attack formation its advance was halted by devastating fire. Capt. Jacobs, with the command element of the lead company, called for and directed air strikes on the enemy positions to facilitate a renewed attack. Due to the intensity of the enemy fire and heavy casualties to the command group, including the company commander, the attack stopped and the friendly troops became disorganized. Although wounded by mortar fragments, Capt. Jacobs assumed command of the <b>allied</b> <b>company,</b> ordered a withdrawal from the exposed position and established a defensive perimeter. Despite profuse bleeding from head wounds which impaired his vision, Capt. Jacobs, with complete disregard for his safety, returned under intense fire to evacuate a seriously wounded advisor to the safety of a wooded area where he administered lifesaving first aid. He then returned through heavy automatic weapons fire to evacuate the wounded company commander. Capt. Jacobs made repeated trips across the fire-swept open rice paddies evacuating wounded and their weapons. On 3 separate occasions, Capt. Jacobs contacted and drove off Viet Cong squads who were searching for allied wounded and weapons, single-handedly killing 3 and wounding several others. His gallant actions and extraordinary heroism saved the lives of 1 U.S. advisor and 13 allied soldiers.

40|$|AbstractLiterature on airline {{partnerships}} is growing, and {{has thus}} far mostly dealt with the price effects of airline consolidation. There is no clear consensus, though, whether the alliances on international markets do bring benefits to the member companies. Therefore the paper focuses on examination {{of the effects of}} alliances on size-indicators of airlines based on the panel data analysis of data from 65 air-operators 14 of which are members of one of the three major alliances (Star Alliance, SkyTeam, OneWorld). Panel data analysis examines the influence of alliance membership on turnover, total assets, and number of employees. Source data are taken from the Amadeus database, and reflect 10 -year time series of 2003 - 2012. Calculated values of determination coefficients prove a very strong impact of an alliance membership on turnover and total assets, and relatively strong impact on the number of employees of a particular <b>allied</b> <b>company...</b>|$|E
