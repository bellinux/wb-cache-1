25|$|Usually {{atmospheric}} air supplies the oxygen for combustion, and limits assume the normal concentration of oxygen in air.

Interoceptive accuracy was overall fairly high (r = 0. 56 - 0. 74), but it dropped considerably (r = 0. 27), when bodily sensations were induced in high NA persons in a negative information frame (interaction, p < 0. 005).

2500|$|Diesel fuel [...] {{in general}} is any liquid fuel used in diesel engines, whose fuel {{ignition}} takes place, without any spark, {{as a result of}} compression of the inlet <b>air</b> <b>mixture</b> and then injection of fuel. (Glow plugs, grid heaters and block heaters help achieve high temperatures for combustion during engine startup in cold weather.) Diesel engines have found broad use as a result of higher thermodynamic efficiency and thus fuel efficiency. This is particularly noted where diesel engines are run at part-load; as their air supply is not throttled as in a petrol engine, their efficiency still remains very high.|$|E

40|$|The {{explosion}} behaviour of heterogeneous/homogeneous fuel-air (hybrid) mixtures is here analysed {{and compared}} to the explosion features of heterogeneous fuel-air and homogeneous fuel <b>air</b> <b>mixtures</b> separately. Experiments are performed to measure the pressure history, deflagration index and flammability limits of nicotinic acid/acetone-air mixtures in a standard 20 L Siwek bomb adapted to vapour-air mixtures. Literature data are also used for comparison. The explosion tests performed on gas-air mixtures in the same conditions as explosion tests of dust-air mixtures, show {{that the increase in}} explosion severity of dust/gas <b>air</b> <b>mixtures</b> has to be addressed to the role of initial level of turbulence prior to ignition. At a fixed value of the equivalence ratio, by substituting the dust to the flammable gas in a dust/gas-air mixture the explosion severity decreases. Furthermore, the most severe conditions of dust-gas/air mixtures is found during explosion of gas-air mixture at stoichiometric concentration. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCorrelating {{turbulent}} {{burning velocity}} to turbulence intensity and basic flame parameters-like laminar burning velocity for dust <b>air</b> <b>mixtures</b> {{is not only}} a scientific challenge but also of practical importance for the modelling of dust flame propagation in industrial facilities and choice of adequate safety strategy. The open tube method has been implemented to measure laminar and turbulent burning velocities at laboratory scale for turbulence intensities in the range of a few m/s. Special care has been given to the experimental technique so that a direct access to the desired parameters was possible minimising interpretation difficulties. In particular, the flame is propagating freely, the flame velocity is directly accessible by visualisation and the turbulence intensity is measured at the flame front during flame propagation with special aerodynamic probes. In the present paper, those achievements are briefly recalled. In addition, a complete set of experiments for diametrically opposed dusts, starch and aluminium, has been performed and is presented hereafter.
