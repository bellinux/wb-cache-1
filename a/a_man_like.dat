5|$|I had viewed Hitler and his {{movement}} with some skepticism, {{but when the}} abolition of the multi-party mess removed the obscenity of unemployment, and the first 1,000 kilometers of autobahns opened up a new era of mobility, I too saw the light: this was the time when Churchill said he hoped Great Britain would have <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> Hitler in time of peril, and when high church dignitaries and distinguished academics paid the Führer homage.|$|E
25|$|But for me {{that saying}} of Pittacus doesn’t ring true either (even {{if he was a}} smart man): he says “being good is hard.” For me, a man's good enough as long as he's not lawless, and if he has the common {{sense of right and wrong}} that does a city good—a decent guy. I {{certainly}} won’t find fault with <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> that. After all, there’s an endless supply of stupid fools. The way I see it, if there’s no great shame in it, it's all right.|$|E
25|$|Cutting a leg-break {{is always}} dangerous, and cutting Wright {{is a form}} of suicide. Why a bowler of his skill failed to get more test-match wickets always mystified me; there was of course the marked {{tendency}} to bowl no-balls, but he sent down so many good ones, and worried and beat the batsmen so often, that he should have had better results...he seemed always likely to get wickets. It is one of the toughest problems of captaincy to know when to remove <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> that from the firing -line.|$|E

25|$|In these lectures, Newman denounced various anti-Catholic utterances. These {{included}} {{those of}} the Maria Monk, the allegation of cells under his own Oratory on Hagley Road, Birmingham and those of Giacinto Achilli. Newman emphasises the importance of responding to Achilli: For how, Brothers of the Oratory, can we possibly believe <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> this , in what he says about persons and facts, and conversations, and events, when he is of the stamp of Maria Monk, of Jeffreys, and of Teodore, and of others who have had their hour, and then been dropped by the indignation or the shame of mankind.|$|E
25|$|I {{want to see}} {{institutions}} like Throop turn out perhaps ninety-nine of every hundred students as men who are to do given pieces of industrial work better than any one else can do them; I want to see those men {{do the kind of}} work that is now being done on the Panama Canal and on the great irrigation projects in the interior of this country—and the one-hundredth man I want to see with the kind of cultural scientific training that will make him and his fellows the matrix out of which you can occasionally develop <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> your great astronomer, George Ellery Hale.|$|E
25|$|In early July 2017, Israel′s defence {{minister}} Avigdor Liberman {{said that while}} ″the rebels are not our friends, they are all versions of al-Qaida”, Israel could not allow <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> Assad to remain in power: “Keeping Assad in power is not in our security interests. As long as he is in power, Iran and Hezbollah will be in Syria.” He said that Israel {{had no interest in}} entering the Syrian civil war, but there were ″red lines″ Israel had set, such as the smuggling of sophisticated weaponry to Hezbollah and Iran′a presence on its borders. Later in July 2017, the Israeli government said it opposed the cease-fire agreement in southern Syria that the United States and Russia had reached a week prior that envisaged establishing de-escalation zones along Syria’s borders with both Jordan and Israel, as that would legalise Iran′s presence in Syria.|$|E

He had written three times to the bishop, and he had sent <b>a</b> <b>man</b> over to Hogglestock to get his little bill settled six days running. You see he got it at last.

500|$|... « Toccata »: In this introduction, we are {{introduced}} to the narrator, and discover how he has ended up in France after the war. He {{is the director of}} a lace factory, has a wife, children, and grandchildren, though he has no real affection for his family and continues his homosexual encounters when he travels on business. He hints of an incestuous love, which we learn later was for his twin sister. He explains that he has decided to write about his experiences during the war for his own benefit and not as an attempt to justify himself. He closes the introduction by saying, [...] "I live, I do what can be done, it's the same for everyone, I am <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> other men, I am <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> you. I tell you I am just like you!" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Si Una Vez" [...] {{is written}} in the key of D minor and is played in a {{moderate}} groove of 84 beats per minute. It incorporates music from several musical instruments, including the piano and guitar. Lyrically, Selena reminiscences her failed relationship and wonders why she ever {{fell in love with}} an abusive partner who betrayed and left her, vowing to never allow <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> that back into her life. The lyrics suggest unrequited love and female empowerment.|$|E
500|$|Dominique Francon is {{the heroine}} of The Fountainhead, {{described}} by Rand as [...] "the woman for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> Howard Roark". Rand described Dominique as similar to herself [...] "in a bad mood". For {{most of the}} novel, the character operates from what Rand viewed as wrong ideas. Believing that the values she admires cannot survive in the real world, she chooses {{to turn away from}} them so that the world cannot harm her. Only {{at the end of the}} novel does she accept that she can be happy and survive.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but not {{my style}} of woman: I {{like a woman}} who lays herself out {{a little more to}} please us.

The more of a dead set she makes at you the better." ...|$|R

500|$|It is not {{recorded}} {{what became of}} Domery, or of the other Hoche captives, following their internment, {{and it is not}} known if he returned to France or Poland or remained in Liverpool. The case of Charles Domery briefly returned to public notice in 1852 {{when it came to the}} attention of Charles Dickens, who wrote of Domery that [...] "Now, it is my opinion, that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> this, dining in public on the stage of Drury Lane, would draw much better than a mere tragedian, who chews unsubstantial words instead of wholesome beef".|$|E
500|$|... "Homer's Enemy" [...] was {{directed}} by Jim Reardon and the script was written by John Swartzwelder, based on an idea pitched by executive producer Bill Oakley. The episode explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong work ethic hired for a job where he has to work alongside <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> Homer. He was partially modeled after Michael Douglas as he appeared in the film Falling Down. Hank Azaria provided the voice of Frank Grimes, and based some of the character's mannerisms on actor William H. Macy. Frank Welker guest stars {{as the voice of}} the Executive Vice President dog.|$|E
500|$|After {{learning}} from Lonnie that Hud {{is trying to}} seize the ranch, Homer confronts Hud. [...] Infuriated by his eroded inheritance, Hud threatens to have Homer declared legally incompetent so he can take over the ranch. [...] Homer tells his son he will lose. He admits that he made mistakes raising Hud, and was too hard on him. When Hud accuses him of having a [...] "shape up or ship out" [...] policy, Homer wonders aloud how <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> Hud can be his son and storms off to his room. Hud, drunk, goes outside and tries to rape Alma before Lonnie comes to her aid.|$|E

500|$|Davies {{left the}} role of {{producer}} in 1994, but continued to write for the series on occasion. Notably, he was requested to write the 100th episode of the series, by then called The Ward, which aired in October 1996. Instead of celebrating the milestone, he wrote a script about a recently emerging threat: paedophiles in online chat-rooms. The episode was about an X-Files fan who was drawn in by a paedophile's offer of a rare magazine. In the dénouement of the episode, the child recounts the tale of his near abduction and describes his attacker as [...] "just <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> any other man". The episode earned Davies his first BAFTA award: the 1997 Children's BAFTA for Best Drama.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his success}} in {{advancing}} Nixon's career, Chotiner was respected, but was not universally popular among the Vice President's backers. Frank Jorgensen, one of Nixon's first backers in the Voorhis race, said of the attorney, [...] "I knew that Murray was very impatient with people who didn't have the IQ that he had. He had the habit of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> that of tramping on them. He'd move ahead. He'd just leave the wreckage behind him, but he would get the job done." [...] Nixon family friend and Whittier College trustee Herman Perry stated, [...] "When Murray develops {{a little more of}} the techniques of public relations, I {{will be one of the}} first to recognize it and one of the first to give him credit... The one thing I do not want him to do is be the quarterback and call the plays on the team on which I play." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{weight of}} information, and its {{constant}} repetition, made an apparently strong case against Driberg, and former friends such as Mervyn Stockwood, the Bishop of Southwark, {{became convinced that}} he had indeed betrayed his country. Other friends and colleagues were more sceptical. According to ex-Labour MP Reginald Paget, not even the security services were [...] "lunatic enough to recruit <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> Driberg", who was famously indiscreet and could never keep a secret. Mitrokhin's [...] "blackmail" [...] story is questioned by historian Jeff Sharlet, {{on the grounds that}} by the 1950s and 1960s Driberg's homosexuality had been an open secret in British political circles for many years; he frequently boasted of his [...] "rough trade" [...] conquests to his colleagues. The journalist A. N. Wilson quotes Churchill commenting years before that [...] "Tom Driberg is {{the sort of person who}} gives sodomy a bad name".|$|E

500|$|On December 27, 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt, a {{personal}} friend of Saint-Gaudens, wrote to his Secretary of the Treasury, Leslie Mortier Shaw: [...] "I think {{the state of our}} coinage is artistically of atrocious hideousness. [...] Would it be possible, without asking permission of Congress, to employ <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> Saint-Gaudens to give us a coinage which would have some beauty?" [...] Roosevelt had Mint Director George E. Roberts write to Saint-Gaudens, who replied, [...] "I am extremely interested in the matter of the new designs of the coinage... it will I assure you give me great pleasure to assist in the procuring of good work." [...] Roosevelt caused the Mint to engage Saint-Gaudens to redesign some of the coins which could be changed without the need for Congressional approval—the cent and the four gold coins. [...] No U.S. coin had ever been designed by anyone other than a Mint employee.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Kelsey is accosted by {{the factory}} guards, which causes her to rant about the {{treatment}} she has received. Wormwood subdues her by revealing her true form, and having discovered Kelsey and Sarah Jane live on the same street, uses her PR representative Davey (Jamie Davis) to escort her home. Once there, Maria realises upon sight of Kelsey that Davey had discovered Sarah and tries to run into Sarah Jane's house. Eventually realising their intent, Sarah Jane brings them inside, with Davey, now as a Bane, giving chase. Sarah Jane is able to repel Davey and then, upon discovery of the attic by Kelsey, tells the teenagers about aliens: years ago, she met the Doctor, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> no other, who took her through time and space. The adventures suddenly ended, but when they met by chance (in [...] "School Reunion") not long ago, they realised they were still fond of each other. Sarah Jane has a brief reunion with K9, who is in her safe, sealing off a black hole.|$|E
500|$|Pfefferberg, {{one of the}} Schindlerjuden, made it his life's {{mission to}} tell the story of his savior. Pfefferberg {{attempted}} to produce a biopic of Oskar Schindler with MGM in 1963, with Howard Koch writing, but the deal fell through. In 1982, Thomas Keneally published his historical novel Schindler's Ark, which he wrote after a chance meeting with Pfefferberg in Los Angeles in 1980. MCA president Sid Sheinberg sent director Steven Spielberg a New York Times review of the book. Spielberg, astounded by Schindler's story, jokingly asked if it was true. [...] "I was drawn to it because of the paradoxical nature of the character," [...] he said. [...] "What would drive <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>like</b> this to suddenly take everything he had earned and put it all in the service of saving these lives?" [...] Spielberg expressed enough interest for Universal Pictures to buy the rights to the novel. At their first meeting in spring 1983, he told Pfefferberg he would start filming in ten years. In the end credits of the film, Pfefferberg is credited as a consultant under the name Leopold Page.|$|E
