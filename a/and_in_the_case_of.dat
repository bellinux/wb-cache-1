5|$|All major moons {{comprise}} {{approximately equal}} amounts rock and ice, except Miranda, {{which is made}} primarily of ice. The ice component may include ammonia and carbon dioxide. Their surfaces are heavily cratered, though all of them (except Umbriel) show signs of endogenic resurfacing {{in the form of}} lineaments (canyons) <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Miranda, ovoid race-track like structures called coronae. Extensional processes associated with upwelling diapirs are likely responsible for the origin of the coronae. Ariel appears to have the youngest surface with the fewest impact craters, while Umbriel's appears oldest. A past 3:1 orbital resonance between Miranda and Umbriel and a past 4:1 resonance between Ariel and Titania are thought to be responsible for the heating that caused substantial endogenic activity on Miranda and Ariel.|$|E
5|$|As {{the files}} {{converge}} {{on the east}} frieze we encounter the first women celebrants E2–27, E50–51, E53–63.

Their proximity to the deities indicates their importance, but selecting differently, then nine of them may be the archons of the polis or athlothetai officials who managed the procession; there is insufficient iconographic evidence to determine which interpretation is correct.|$|E
5|$|Bacteriophages are {{a common}} and diverse group of viruses and are the most {{abundant}} form of biological entity in aquatic environments– there are up to ten times more of these viruses in the oceans than there are bacteria, reaching levels of 250,000,000 bacteriophages per millilitre of seawater. These viruses infect specific bacteria by binding to surface receptor molecules and then entering the cell. Within {{a short amount of}} time, in some cases just minutes, bacterial polymerase starts translating viral mRNA into protein. These proteins go on to become either new virions within the cell, helper proteins, which help assembly of new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis. Viral enzymes aid in the breakdown of the cell membrane, <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> the T4 phage, in just over twenty minutes after injection over three hundred phages could be released.|$|E

The latter two were edited, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Anarchy, partially rewritten by his editor, Scott Brassart. Testosterone needed only minor changes, while Anarchy underwent an entire rewrite, with Brassart restructuring the plot and streamlining over 500 pages of prose and notes into a fast-paced, 250 page novel. For the reader, however, it is only Baker's voice as writer that is heard.|$|E
5|$|Blérancourt's {{traditional}} {{power structure}} was reshaped {{by the events}} of 1789. The notary Gellé, previously an undisputed town leader, was challenged by a group of reformists who were led by several of Saint-Just's friends, including the husband of his sister Louise. Their attempts were not successful until 1790 when Blérancourt held its first open municipal elections. Mandated by the National Constituent Assembly, the new electoral structure allowed Saint-Just's friends to assume authority in the village as mayor, secretary, <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> his brother-in-law, head of the local National Guard.

5|$|Despite the {{apparent}} cheapness of manufacture of their basic components, many surviving examples of Late Roman helmets, including the Intercisa type, show evidence of expensive decoration {{in the form}} of silver or silver-gilt sheathing.

Other academics, in contrast, consider that silver-sheathed helmets may have been widely worn by comitatenses soldiers, given as a form of pay or reward. Roman law indicates that all helmets of this construction were supposed to be sheathed in a specific amount of gold or silver.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{widespread}} assumption that plug-in recharging {{will take place}} overnight at home, residents of cities, apartments, dormitories, and townhouses do not have garages or driveways with available power outlets, and they might {{be less likely to}} buy plug-in electric vehicles unless recharging infrastructure is developed. Electrical outlets or charging stations near their places of residence, in commercial or public parking lots, streets and workplaces are required for these potential users to gain the full advantage of PHEVs, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> EVs, to avoid the fear of the batteries running out energy before reaching their destination, commonly called range anxiety.

5|$|Diptera {{go through}} a {{complete}} metamorphosis with four distinct life stages – egg, larva, pupa and adult. In many flies, the larval stage is long and adults may have a short life. Most dipteran larvae develop in protected environments; many are aquatic and others are found in moist places such as carrion, fruit, vegetable matter, fungi <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> parasitic species, inside their hosts. They tend to have thin cuticles and become desiccated if exposed to the air. Apart from the Brachycera, most dipteran larvae have sclerotinised head capsules, which may be reduced to remnant mouth hooks; the Brachycera, however, have soft, gelatinized head capsules from which the sclerites are reduced or missing. Many of these larvae retract their heads into their thorax.|$|E

Dickson Wright refutes the popular idea that spices were used to disguise bad meat, pointing out that this would have been as fatal then as it would be today. She suggests instead that spices were used to hide the taste of salt, which was used to preserve food in the absence of refrigeration.|$|E
