5|$|According to an {{analysis}} by Tim Flannery, the ecosystem of Lord Howe Island is threatened by climate change and global warming, with the reefs <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>from</b> rises in water temperature. The Great Barrier Reef is specifically identified as being at risk {{to the effects of}} global warming on Australia, and the same analysis applies to the reefs of Lord Howe Island. Cool climate flora and fauna are <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>from</b> rises in temperature, because there is limited scope for migration to higher altitudes.. The first international conference on global artificial photosynthesis as a climate change solution occurred at Lord Howe island in 2011, the papers being published by the Australian Journal of Chemistry.|$|E

5|$|Although {{volcanic}} eruptions in Hawaiʻi rarely produce casualties (the only direct historical fatality due to volcanic {{activity on the}} island occurred at Kīlauea in 1924, when an unusually explosive eruption hurled rocks at an onlooker), property damage due to inundation by lava is a common and costly hazard. Hawaiian-type eruptions usually produce extremely slow-moving flows that advance at walking pace, presenting little danger to human life, {{but this is not}} strictly the case; Mauna Loa's 1950 eruption emitted as much lava in three weeks as Kīlauea's current eruption produces in three years and reached sea level within four hours of its start, overrunning the village of Hoʻokena Mauka and a major highway on the way there. An earlier eruption in 1926 overran the village of Hoʻōpūloa Makai, and Hilo, partly built on lavas from the 1880–81 eruption, is <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>from</b> future eruptions. The 1984 eruption nearly reached the city, but stopped short after the flow was redirected upstream.|$|E
5|$|From late February to mid-March, the 2nd New Zealand Division was {{transferred}} to Syria. The Allied high command was concerned that the Middle East was <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>from</b> an invasion by the Germans and the New Zealanders {{were part of the}} force tasked with blocking their likely route from the Caucasus. The 25th Battalion was stationed close to the border with Turkey, near the town of Idlib, and its platoons manned frontier posts for several weeks. The battalion later shifted to the Djedeide fortress area where it would prepare defences. However, following the attack on the 8th Army's Gazala Line by Panzer Army Africa, the 2nd New Zealand Division was recalled to Egypt. By the end of June, the 25th Battalion, {{along with the rest of}} the 6th Brigade, was setting up camp in the Alamein area.|$|E
5|$|In late 2013, a {{plan was}} {{proposed}} for salvage logging approximately 30,000 acres (120km2) of the Rim Fire. The snag forest habitat of forest-killed trees {{is home to}} a wide variety of wildlife, some of which are management indicator species. Many scientists and conservation groups opposed the logging plan, contending that the removal of trees from this area would harm species such as black-backed woodpeckers and affect other cavity-nesting birds that follow in the wake of the woodpeckers. Other species of wildlife were also considered be <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>from</b> salvage logging, such as frogs that inhabit forested streams and deer. Native plants and basic ecological succession of the forest are also reportedly harmed by salvage logging. However, some environmental groups endorsed the salvage logging plan.|$|E

5|$|The {{first eight}} staff arrived in Montreal {{at the end}} of 1942. These were Goldschmidt and Pierre Auger from France, George Placzek from Czechoslovakia, S. G. Bauer from Switzerland, Friedrich Paneth and Halban from Austria, and R. E. Newell and F. R. Jackson from Britain. The Battle of the Atlantic was still raging, and men and equipment, which {{travelled}} separately, were <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>from</b> German U-boats. The scientists occupied a house at 3470 Simpson Street in downtown Montreal that belonged to McGill University. This soon became so crowded that bathrooms were used for offices, with the bath tubs used to store papers and books. They were relieved to move to the more spacious accommodation at the Université de Montréal in March. The laboratory grew to over 300 staff, about half of whom were Canadians recruited by Laurence.|$|E
5|$|Winton {{organised}} {{the transfer}} of the children from the Nazi-appointed Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia to homes in Britain, in the process arranging the necessary bonds and permits for their departure, and finding the families in Britain who would receive the children. Winton and a team identified those children most <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>from</b> the thousands of refugees driven south following the Nazi invasion of the Sudetenland. For each child to be accepted, British officials required a confirmed foster home and a £50 guarantee. Winton returned to Great Britain in March to arrange the reception of the children, but his task was hampered {{by the fact that the}} domestic evacuation of children was already occurring, and places were hard to find.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Wars of Scottish Independence, in 1296, Brougham became an important military base for Robert Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford. He began refortifying the castle: the wooden outer defences were replaced with stronger, more impressive stone walls, and a large stone gatehouse was added. The importance of Brougham and Robert Clifford was such that, in 1300, he hosted King Edward I of England at the castle. Robert's son, Roger Clifford, was executed as a traitor, in 1322, and the family estates passed into the possession of King Edward II of England, although they were returned once his son Edward III became king. The region was often <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>from</b> the Scots, and in 1388, the castle was captured and sacked.|$|E

5|$|In February 1944, the Japanese Combined Fleet {{withdrew from}} its base at Truk in the Central Pacific to Palau and Singapore. The {{appearance}} of a powerful Japanese naval force at Singapore concerned the Allies, as it was feared that these ships could potentially conduct raids in the Indian Ocean and against Western Australia. In response, the Allies strengthened their naval and air forces in the area by transferring two British light cruisers from the Atlantic and Mediterranean {{as well as several}} U.S. Navy warships from the Pacific. The number of air units in Ceylon and the Bay of Bengal region was also increased. Admiral James Somerville, the commander of the British Eastern Fleet, feared that the Japanese would repeat their devastating Indian Ocean raid of early 1942, and on 25February requested permission to withdraw his fleet from its base at Trincomalee so that it was not <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>from</b> the larger Japanese force. The Admiralty rejected this request, and directed that the fleet should remain at Trincomalee unless it was threatened by a superior Japanese force as its withdrawal would affect morale and harm Britain's prestige in the region. It was agreed, however, that the Eastern Fleet should not engage superior Japanese forces and could withdraw if Somerville judged this necessary.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} Fighter Command's need for {{units in the}} south of the country, No. 41 Squadron was redeployed to RAF Hornchurch in Essex on 3 September 1940. On 5 September, Lock flew as Red 2, {{positioned}} behind and protecting the Squadron's Leader. He shot down two Heinkel He 111s over the Thames Estuary. One of his victims crashed into a river, the other caught fire and its undercarriage fell down. Lock followed it down. He quickly realised his mistake—reducing height to pursue a damaged enemy put a pilot <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>from</b> enemy fighters—but it was too late. A Messerschmitt Bf 109 attacked him and he sustained damage to his Spitfire and a wound to his leg. Lock immediately zoom-climbed. The Bf 109 attempted to follow but the pilot stalled and fell away. Lock reversed direction and dived. Waiting for the German fighter to come out of its dive he fired several short bursts and it exploded. Looking around he saw the second He 111 land in the English Channel, about ten miles from the first. Lock circled above the He 111 and noticing a boat he alerted the boat to its presence by flying over it and led the vessel to the crash site. As he left the scene he saw the crew surrendering to the occupants of the boat. On the way home he saw his first victim in the river, with a dingy nearby. A further Bf 109 was claimed destroyed on that date.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the most}} {{widespread}} of Asian rhinoceroses, the Javan rhinoceros ranged from the islands of Java and Sumatra, throughout Southeast Asia, and into India and China. The species is critically endangered, with only one known population in the wild, and no individuals in captivity. It is possibly the rarest large mammal on Earth, {{with a population of}} as few as 58 to 61 in Ujung Kulon National Park at the western tip of Java in Indonesia. A second population in Cat Tien National Park in Vietnam was confirmed as extinct in 2011. The decline of the Javan rhinoceros is attributed to poaching, primarily for their horns, which are highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine, fetching as much as US$30,000 per kg on the black market. As European presence in their range increased, trophy hunting also became a serious threat. Loss of habitat, especially as the result of wars, such as the Vietnam War, in Southeast Asia, has also contributed to the species' decline and hindered recovery. The remaining range is within one nationally protected area, but the rhinos are still <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>from</b> poachers, disease, and loss of genetic diversity leading to inbreeding depression.|$|E
