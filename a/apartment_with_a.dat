Mozart bought a fine fortepiano from Anton Walter for about 900 florins, and a billiard table for about 300. The Mozarts sent their son Karl Thomas to an expensive boarding school, and kept servants. Saving was therefore impossible, and the short period of financial success did nothing to soften the hardship the Mozarts were later to experience.|$|E

25|$|Viki {{surprisingly}} {{manages to}} pass her theater audition, though it's obvious {{the reason for}} the sudden success is jury member Baron being taken with her attractive looks. Though she's ecstatic, Filip is not thrilled with the development and is especially unhappy about the celebrated theater actor and multiple divorcee Baron now wooing his girlfriend, with Viki even welcoming the aging lothario's smooth advances. Frustrated, Filip even contacts Ema hoping to receive some help getting through to Viki whose head is high in the clouds. For the moment at least, Giga and Ema manage to impart some rationality to their daughter, and she seems ready to take the sensible option and make nice with Filip. In parallel, in order to sweeten his case with Viki, Baron arranges for her, a complete novice, to get the demanding role of Juliet in the theater's latest production of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, while Baron plays Romeo. He tells her the big news by showing up unannounced at the apartment just as she's getting ready to go out to meet Filip for a date. The news sends her on cloud nine and she immediately puts Filip and the marriage on the back-burner while Filip's frustration grows. Soon, Baron manages to bed Viki who thus becomes his latest conquest. Though he's not aware of the gory details yet, Filip has seen enough to send him over the edge and, overcome with jealousy, he constantly interrupts their rehearsals. It all culminates in an act of madness as he breaks into Baron's <b>apartment</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gun, threatening to kill him, but the verbose actor talks him out of it using a combination of pointed eloquence and dramatic flair.|$|E

[...] Xu Beihong, the president of CAFA and a pioneer in using realism in oil painting, admired {{the manner in which}} the work fulfilled its political mission, but complained that because of the colors, it barely resembled an oil painting. [...] He and others, though, saw that {{the painting}} opened a new chapter in Chinese art development. [...] Zhu Dan, head of the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, which would reproduce the painting for the masses, argued that it was more a poster than an oil painting. [...] Other artists stated that Dong's earlier works, such as Kazakh Shepherdess (1947) and Liberation (1949), were better examples of the new national style of art. [...] The painting appeared on the front page of People's Daily in September 1953, and became an officially approved interior decoration.
