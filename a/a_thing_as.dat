5|$|The {{concept of}} Lightning Returns battle system {{originated}} while ideas were being discussed for the battle system in Final Fantasy XIII, but technical limitations and problems implementing it in a party-based battle system prevented {{it from being}} used in that game. It reemerged {{when some of the}} development team wanted Lightning to change her appearance during battle, and reducing to one playable character opened up the memory space necessary for such a system to be implemented. In making the system revolve around one character, the developers ended up removing any opportunity for story scenes between party members, which was cited by Abe as its main weakness. The time limit sprang from the story concept of a world with a set time to live. When the feature was first announced, there were some who felt it was too new <b>a</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>as</b> a time limit was seen as a taboo in role-playing video games. The mechanic originally received negative feedback from test players who were unable to complete the game in time. In response to this, the team made adjustments so that players were given a more comfortable amount of time. Along with sharing design elements with the previous two XIII games, the system also bears similarities to the battle system of Final Fantasy XV, although the developers said that they were not directly inspired by it.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{some have}} also claimed this {{argument}} fails {{to account for}} Jason Marsh's point on natural nonbelief in early humans. Since there was quite plausibly such <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> natural nonbelief in early humans, then it doesn't make much sense to say that said nonbelief is self-deceptive. That's because natural nonbelief entails nonresistant nonbelief.|$|E

25|$|The biblical {{concept of}} righteousness {{was rooted in}} the covenant-making God who had ordered {{creation}} for communal well-being, and the righteous were those who invested in the community, showing special concern {{for the poor and}} needy (see Job's description of his life in chapter 31). Their antithesis were the wicked, who were selfish and greedy. Satan {{raises the question of whether}} there is such <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> disinterested righteousness: if God rewards righteousness with prosperity, will men not act righteously from selfish motives? He asks God to test this by removing the prosperity of Job, the most righteous of all God's servants.|$|E
25|$|Some {{hold the}} view that {{informal}} logic is not a branch or subdiscipline of logic, or even {{the view that}} there cannot be such <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> informal logic. Massey criticizes informal logic {{on the grounds that}} it has no theory underpinning it. Informal logic, he says, requires detailed classification schemes to organize it, which in other disciplines is provided by the underlying theory. He maintains that there is no method of establishing the invalidity of an argument aside from the formal method, and that the study of fallacies may be of more interest to other disciplines, like psychology, than to philosophy and logic.|$|E
25|$|All bloody {{principles}} and practices we do utterly deny, with all outward wars, and strife, and fightings with outward weapons, for any end, or under any pretence whatsoever, {{and this is}} our testimony to the whole world. That spirit of Christ by which we are guided is not changeable, so as once to command us from <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> evil and again to move unto it; and we do certainly know, and so testify to the world, {{that the spirit of}} Christ, which leads us into all Truth, will never move us to fight and war against any man with outward weapons, neither for the kingdom of Christ, nor for the kingdoms of this world.|$|E

25|$|In {{cooperation}} with the literary scholar , DAS GEDICHT initiated a widely followed debate on, “Is there such <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a European poem?” Alongside translations from English, Spanish, or Classical Greek authors, the magazine regularly features German-language poetry from outside Germany, such as Austrian, Swiss, and Luxembourgian poetry. DAS GEDICHT has also often been the root of productive altercations among aesthetic positions and has facilitated debate among poets. Looking at the question – short poem or long poem – many prominent German poets engaged in critical exchange {{within the realm of}} the magazine: Durs Grünbein, , and Jürgen Becker. The critic and member of the Group 47, , dedicated a larger portion of his radio broadcast, in order to give this debate a national audience.|$|E
500|$|Advocating a {{compromise}} between positive and private morality, Russell first emphasises {{that there is such}} <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> moral progress, a progress which may occur through revolutions.

500|$|The Stoics {{admitted}} {{between the}} good and the bad a third class of things – the indifferent (adiaphora). Of things morally indifferent, the best includes health, and riches, and honour, and the worst includes sickness and poverty. Chrysippus accepted that it was normal in ordinary usage to refer to the preferred indifferent things as [...] "good", but the wise person, said Chrysippus, uses such things without requiring them. Practice and habit are necessary to render virtue perfect in the individual – in other words, there is such <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> moral progress, and character has to be built up.|$|E

500|$|Debs {{was noted}} {{by many to}} be a charismatic speaker who {{sometimes}} called on the vocabulary of Christianity and much of the oratorical style of evangelism – even though he was generally disdainful of organized religion. It has been said, that Debs was what every socialist and radical should be; fierce in his convictions, but kind and compassionate in his personal relations. As Heywood Broun noted in his eulogy for Debs, quoting a fellow Socialist: [...] "That old man with the burning eyes actually believes that there can be such <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> the brotherhood of man. And that's not the funniest part of it. As long as he's around I believe it myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Conduct {{books have}} {{traditionally}} been viewed by scholars as an integral factor {{in the creation of}} a bourgeois sense of self. The conduct book [...] "helped to generate the belief that there was such <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a 'middle class' and that the modest, submissive but morally and domestically competent woman it described was the first 'modern individual'". By developing a specifically bourgeois ethos through genres such as the conduct book, the emerging middle class challenged the primacy of the aristocratic code of manners. However, conduct books simultaneously constricted women's roles, propagating what has been called [...] "the angel in the house" [...] image (alluding to Coventry Patmore's poem of that name). Women were encouraged to be chaste, pious, submissive, modest, selfless, graceful, pure, delicate, compliant, reticent, and polite.|$|E
500|$|By 04:00, after {{withstanding}} {{several more}} assaults, {{some of which}} resulted in hand-to-hand fighting, and severe sniper fire from all sides, Edson's men were joined by troops from the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, who helped repulse two more Japanese attacks before dawn. Throughout the night, as Kawaguchi's men came close to overrunning the Marine defenses, Edson remained standing about [...] behind the Marine firing line on Hill 123, exhorting his troops and directing their defensive efforts. Said Marine Captain Tex Smith, who was in position to observe Edson {{for most of the}} night, [...] "I can say that if there is such <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> one man holding a battalion together, Edson did it that night. He stood just behind the front lines – stood, when most of us hugged the ground." ...|$|E

500|$|Selections from Cardus's Manchester Guardian cricket {{writings}} {{were published}} {{in a series of}} books between 1922 and 1937. Because of financial constraints the paper did not send [...] "Cricketer" [...] to Australia to cover the [...] "Bodyline" [...] tour of 1932–33. Cardus was generally approving of Jardine's controversial bodyline tactics, writing on 5 March 1933: [...] "ad [...] been a weak man, all the energy of Larwood [...] might have proved as vain <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> it did in 1930". In 1936–37, Cardus accompanied the MCC team to Australia; otherwise he continued to write on English domestic cricket until the 1939 season was summarily truncated. On 1 September, the day that Germany invaded Poland, Cardus observed the removal of the bust of W. G. Grace from the Lord's pavilion; he was informed by a bystander: [...] "That means war".|$|E
500|$|Upon release, Sheryl Crow {{received}} general acclaim {{from most}} music critics. Eric Weisbard of Spin praised the album's production, {{stating that the}} record [...] "goes much further" [...] than its predecessor and that its [...] "bigger beats and dirtier guitar/keyboard effects [...] well with Crow's literate hippie-chick persona". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated similar pros, commenting: [...] "If there's such <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a professional lo-fi album, Sheryl Crow is it." [...] He also noted Crow's louder and more assured singing, concluding that she [...] "doesn't expose that much of herself [...] she's an emotional centrist. But at the very least, she's building a bridge to a lasting career". Writing for The Baltimore Sun, J.D. Considine praised Crow's vocals, especially on [...] "If It Makes You Happy", which he felt was probably the album's best song.|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{called the}} film [...] "Pixar's ninth {{consecutive}} wonder", {{saying it was}} imaginative yet straightforward. He said it pushed the boundaries of animation by balancing esoteric ideas with more immediately accessible ones, and that {{the main difference between}} the film and other science fiction projects rooted in an apocalypse was its optimism. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter declared that WALL-E surpassed the achievements of Pixar's previous eight features and probably their most original film to date. He said it had the [...] "heart, soul, spirit and romance" [...] of the best silent films. Honeycutt said the film's definitive stroke of brilliance was in using a mix of archive film footage and computer graphics to trigger WALL-E's romantic leanings. He praised Burtt's sound design, saying [...] "If there is such <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> an aural sleight of hand, this is it." ...|$|E

500|$|Lurie {{argued that}} Taft {{did not receive}} the public credit for his {{policies}} that he should have. Few trusts had been broken up under Roosevelt (although the lawsuits received much publicity). Taft, more quietly than his predecessor, filed many more cases than did Roosevelt, and rejected his predecessor's contention that there was such <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a [...] "good" [...] trust. This lack of flair marred Taft's presidency; according to Lurie, Taft [...] "was boring—honest, likable, but boring". Scott Bomboy for the National Constitution Center wrote that despite being [...] "one of the most interesting, intellectual, and versatile presidents... a {{chief justice of the}} United States, a wrestler at Yale, a reformer, a peace activist, and a baseball fan ... today, Taft is best remembered as the president who was so large that he got stuck in the White House bathtub," [...] a story that, despite Taft's fondness for bathtubs, is not true. Taft similarly remains known for another physical characteristic—as the last president with facial hair to date.|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{admitted}} that the chorus of the song is triumphant. Chris Norris of Blender wrote that the song [...] "evokes both early-'80s dance giants the S.O.S. Band and early-'80s dance giant Madonna." [...] Matt Zabosek of The Chicago Maroon wrote: [...] "...'Get Together' is probably the best, but it's hard not to feel that Madonna's computerized voice is a cheat (perhaps to cover for the high notes she can no longer reach?)" [...] Diego Costa of The UWM Post in review of the song, wrote: [...] "In this one-step-up-from-lounge-track, Madonna is a teen again, wondering {{if there is such}} <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> love at first sight. But in the end, as a wise woman, she realizes that whether it exists or not, she doesn't care, since 'all is just an illusion.' Yeah, we heard it all before, she will even admit it in the following track, but it doesn't mean we don't want to hear it again." [...] In 2007, the song was nominated in the category of Best Dance Recording at the 49th Grammy Awards but lost to Justin Timberlake's 2006 single [...] "SexyBack".|$|E
500|$|Also in 1996, Murphy began {{studying}} law at University College Cork (UCC), but he failed {{his first year}} exams because, as he put it, he had [...] "no ambitions to do it". Not only was he busy with his band, but {{he has said that}} he knew within days after starting at UCC that law was not what he wanted to do. After seeing Corcadorca's stage production of , directed by Kiernan, acting had begun to pique his interest. His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society's amateur production of Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme, also starring Irish American comedian, Des Bishop. Murphy also played the lead in a UCC Drama production of Little Shop of Horrors, which was performed in the Cork Opera House. According to Murphy, his primary motivation then was to party and meet women, not to begin an acting career. Nonetheless, he began to move away from working as a rock musician, about which he later remarked, [...] "I think there's such <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a performance gene. If it's in your DNA it needs to come out. For me it originally came out through music, then segued into acting and came out through there. I always needed to get up and perform." ...|$|E
