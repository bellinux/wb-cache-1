40|$|Head {{and neck}} cancers {{are among the}} most {{prevalent}} tumors in the world. Despite advances in the treatment <b>of</b> <b>head</b> and neck tumors, the survival of patients with these cancers has not markedly improved {{over the past several decades}} because of our inability to control and our poor understanding of the regional and distant spread of this disease. One of the factors contributing to our poor understanding may be the lack <b>of</b> reliable <b>animal</b> models <b>of</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer metastasis. The earliest xenograft models in which human tumor cells were grown in immunosuppressed mice involved subcutaneous implantation <b>of</b> human <b>head</b> and neck cancer cell lines. Subcutaneous xenograft models have been popular because they are easy to establish, easy to manage, and lend themselves to ready quantitation of the tumor burden. More recently, orthotopic xenograft models, in which the tumor cells are implanted in the tumor site of origin, have been used with greater frequency in <b>animal</b> studies <b>of</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancers. Orthotopic xenograft models are advantageous for their ability to mimic local tumor growth and recapitulate the pathways of metastasis seen in human head and neck cancers. In addition, recent innovations in cell labeling techniques and small-animal imaging have enabled investigators to monitor the metastatic process and quantitate the growth and spread of orthopically implanted tumors. This review summarizes the progress in the development of murine xenograft models <b>of</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancers. We then discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each type of xenograft model. We also discuss the potential for these models to help elucidate the mechanisms of regional and distant metastasis, which could improve our ability to treat head and neck cancers...|$|R

40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) {{is the leading}} cause of {{mortality}} and disability in young adults. Survivors of TBI suffer from long-term personality changes and deficits in cognitive and motor performance, which urgently requires appropriate and useful animals models that can imitate pathological changes related to human brain injury and thereby choosing the proper pharmacological treatment <b>of</b> the disease. <b>Animal</b> models <b>of</b> traumatic brain injury (TBI) are used to reveal primary and secondary consequences associated with the underlying human head injury in an effort to identify potential neuroprotective therapies for developing and adult brains.

40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} {{strongly suggests}} that apoptosis contributes to neuronal death {{in a variety of}} neurodegenerative contexts. Activation of the cysteine protease caspase 3 appears to be a key event in the execution of apoptosis in the central nervous system. As a result, mice null for caspase 3 display considerable neuronal expansion, usually resulting in death by the second week of life. Consistent with the proposal that apoptosis plays a central role in human neurodegenerative disease, caspase- 3 activation has recently been observed in stroke, spinal cord trauma, head injury and Alzheimer's disease. Indeed, peptide-based caspase inhibitors prevent neuronal loss in <b>animal</b> models <b>of</b> <b>head</b> injury and stroke, suggesting that these compounds may be the forerunners of non-peptide small molecules that halt the apoptotic process implicated in these neurodegenerative disorders. The present review will summarise some of the recent data suggesting that apoptosis inhibitors may become a practical therapeutic approach for both acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions...|$|R

Here, we have evaluated the effect of two apoptogenic HAdV 5 vectors in an immunocompetent Syrian hamster <b>animal</b> model <b>of</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer. We established two cell lines of hamster cheek pouch squamous cell carcinomas, induced by treatment with 9, 10 -dimethyl- 1, 2 -benzanthracene (DMBA). These cell lines, when infected with HAdV 5 mutants lp 11 w and lp 11 w/Δ 55 K (which are defective in the expression of either E 1 B- 19 K alone or both E 1 B- 19 K and E 1 B- 55 K proteins) exhibited enhanced apoptotic and cytotoxic responses. The cheek pouch tumor cells transplanted either subcutaneously at the flanks or in the cheek pouches of hamsters readily formed tumors. Intra-tumoral administration of HAdV 5 E 1 B mutants efficiently suppressed the growth of tumors at both sites. Histological examination of orthotopic tumors revealed reduced vascularity and the expression of the viral fiber antigen in virus-administered cheek pouch tumors. These tumors also exhibited increased caspase- 3 levels, suggesting virus-induced apoptosis may contribute to tumor growth suppression. Our results suggest that the apoptogenic HAdV 5 vectors may have utility for the treatment <b>of</b> human <b>head</b> and neck cancers...|$|R

40|$|Animal {{models are}} {{necessary}} to elucidate changes occurring after brain injury and to establish new therapeutic strategies towards a stage where drug efficacy in brain injured patients (against all classes of symptoms) can be predicted. In this review, six established <b>animal</b> models <b>of</b> <b>head</b> trauma, namely fluid percussion, rigid indentation, inertial acceleration, impact acceleration, weight-drop and dynamic cortical deformation are evaluated. While no single animal model is entirely successful in reproducing the complete spectrum of pathological changes observed after injury, the validity <b>of</b> these <b>animal</b> models including face, construct, etiological and construct validity and how the models constitute theories about brain injury is addressed. The various types of injury including contact (direct impact) and non-contact (acceleration/deceleration) and their associated pathologies are described. The neuropathologic classifications of brain injury including primary and secondary, focal and diffuse are discussed. Animal models and their compatibility with microdialysis studies are summarised particularly regarding the role of excitatory and inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters. This review concludes {{that the study of}} neurotransmitter interactions within and between brain regions can facilitate the development of novel compounds targeted to treat those cognitive deficits not limited to a single pharmacological class and may be useful in the investigation of new therapeutic strategies and pharmacological testing for improved treatment for traumatic head injury...|$|R

The birds have powerful beaks and fan-shaped tails, indicating that they are ravens. The brooches were intended to be worn on each shoulder, after Germanic Iron Age fashion. Archaeologist Peter Vang Petersen comments that while the symbolism of the brooches is open to debate, the shape of the beaks and tail feathers confirm that the brooch depictions are ravens. Petersen notes that [...] "raven-shaped ornaments worn as a pair, after the fashion of the day, one on each shoulder, makes one's thoughts turn towards Odin's ravens and the cult of Odin in the Germanic Iron Age." [...] Petersen says that Odin is associated with disguise and that the masks on the ravens may be portraits of Odin.|$|R

40|$|Background: IL- 13 {{receptor}} (IL- 13 R) targeted cytotoxin, IL 13 -PE 38 QQR, {{has been}} shown to have very potent anti-tumor activity to IL- 13 R-expressing head and neck tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. However, its effect is limited in aggressive tumors. To further improve the anti-tumor activity and safety of IL- 13 cytotoxin, we employed continuous infusion technique in <b>animal</b> model <b>of</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer. Materials and Methods: We surgically implanted continuous infusion (CI) pump intraperitoneally that released drug for 7 days, and its anti-tumor effect was evaluated. A comparison was made for antitumor activity and safety with intravenously (IV) administered IL- 13 cytotoxin in a head and neck (KCCT 873 and HN 12) subcutaneous (SC) xenograft tumor models in nude mice. Vital organ toxicities were assessed by histologic examinations and blood serum chemistry analyses. Results: The 50 or 75 �g/kg/day for 7 days of IL- 13 cytotoxin either by IV or CI administration did not show any difference in safety or anti-tumor activity. IV administration of 150 or 200 �g/kg/day of IL- 13 cytotoxin for 7 days was lethal to nude mice, whereas 200 �g/kg/day � 7 days of CI administration was highly effective in the regression of established tumors without any toxicities. Additionally, CI administration of IL- 13 cytotoxin (200 �g/kg/day) showed growth inhibition of larger HN 12 tumors in nude mice. Conclusion: With a CI schedule, IL- 13 cytotoxin can be systemically administrated at approximately twice the dose otherwise given by daily IV bolus administration...|$|R
40|$|We have {{characterized}} a novel 21 amino acid-peptide {{derived from}} Antrum Mucosal Protein (AMP) - 18 that mediates growth promotion of cultured normal epithelial cells and mitigates radiation-induced oral mucositis in animal models, while suppressing in vitro function of cancer cells. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate these dual potential therapeutic effects of AMP peptide in a clinically relevant <b>animal</b> model <b>of</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer (HNC) by simultaneously assessing its effect on tumor growth and radiation-induced oral mucositis in an orthotopic model of HNC. Bioluminescent SCC- 25 HNC cells were injected into the anterior tongue and tumors that formed were then subjected to focal radiation treatment. Tumor size was assessed using an in vivo imaging system, and the extent of oral mucositis was compared between animals treated with AMP peptide or vehicle (controls). Synergism between AMP peptide and radiation therapy was suggested by the finding that tumors in the AMP peptide/radiation therapy cohort demonstrated inhibited growth vs. radiation therapy-only treated tumors, while AMP peptide-treatment delayed the onset and reduced the severity of radiation therapy-induced oral mucositis. A differential effect on apoptosis appears to be one mechanism by which AMP- 18 can stimulate growth and repair of injured mucosal epithelial cells while inhibiting proliferation of HNC cells. RNA microarray analysis identified pathways that are differentially targeted by AMP- 18 in HNC vs. nontransformed cells. These observations confirm the notion that normal cells and tumor cells may respond differently to common biological stimuli, and that leveraging this finding in the case of AMP- 18 may provide a clinically relevant opportunity...|$|R

Intraocular haemorrhages (IOH) are seen in a majority of cases of AHT. In clinical practice, the pattern of intraocular injury, among other factors, carries some weight in the differentiation of AHT from accidental head injuries. The specific mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of IOH in AHT {{have been the subject}} of considerable debate. A systematic review was performed summarising the retinal findings from all previous studies <b>of</b> <b>head</b> injuries in infants. A multicentre clinical study was performed in Sydney, using the RetCam®, a wide-field paediatric retinal imaging system. The retinal findings were compared, objectively, in 183 infants and children younger than three years with conditions proposed to result in IOH. This included head injury, raised intracranial pressure, raised intrathoracic pressure and hypoxia. A new grading scale to describe and quantify IOH in infants was devised and evaluated, and found to be highly reliable. Retinal haemorrhages were found in 14 % of the overall cohort. Of these, half were found in AHT, and the other half were a mixture of accidental or indeterminate head injuries, raised intracranial or raised intrathoracic pressure. This study was the first to systematically examine the above conditions, using RetCam® imaging to objectively compare findings.
