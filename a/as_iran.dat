5|$|Olver {{has been}} a staunch {{opponent}} of the United States involvement in Iraq, and opposed a United States military presence in Iraq since the 2002 authorization {{for the use of}} force in Iraq. Olver has advocated for the removal of U.S. troops from Iraq, and has consistently voted against proposals to increase funding for military operations and increased deployment. Olver stated that he believes that the United States should seek out a political solution in cooperation with the states neighboring Iraq, such <b>as</b> <b>Iran</b> and Syria, rather than pursuing a strategy based primarily on military means in order to create a stable and democratic Iraq.|$|E
5|$|On 21 September, Nightstalkers flying MH-60 and Little Birds {{took off}} from the frigate USS Jarrett to track an Iranian ship, Iran Ajr. The Nightstalkers {{observed}} Iran Ajr turn off her lights and begin laying mines. After receiving permission to attack, the helicopters fired guns and rockets, stopping the ship. <b>As</b> <b>Iran</b> Ajrs crew began to push mines over the side, the helicopters resumed firing until the crew abandoned ship. Special Boat Teams provided security while a SEAL team boarded the vessel at first light and discovered nine mines on the vessel's deck, {{as well as a}} logbook revealing areas where previous mines had been laid. The logbook implicated Iran in mining international waters.|$|E

Where its range overlaps with carrion crow, as in northern Britain, Germany, Denmark, northern Italy, and Siberia, their hybrids are fertile. However, the hybrids are less well-adapted than purebred birds, {{and this is}} one of the reasons this species was split from the carrion crow. Little or no interbreeding occurs in some areas, such <b>as</b> <b>Iran</b> and central Russia.|$|E
40|$|The present {{research}} is {{a follow-up to}} another study (Rasti & Sahragard, 2012) with an exclusive focus on political metaphor in general and specifically its (de) legitimatory role in the British paper The Economist. The Western paper takes an explicit sanctions-supportive stance on Iran’s nuclear issue. With an eye to spotting instances of political metaphor in the said paper, the researchers, {{in the process of}} analyzing the data, which included 30 argumentative and expository articles taken from the British paper within two time frames – the first spanning 2005 - 2006 and the second encompassing data from 2012 and the beginning of 2013, came up with a superordinate metaphorical pattern i. e., <b>IRAN</b> <b>AS</b> A HUMAN and its concomitant submetaphors i. e., <b>IRAN</b> <b>AS</b> A RACER/PLAYER, <b>IRAN</b> <b>AS</b> A BUSINESSMAN, <b>IRAN</b> <b>AS</b> A SUFFERER, and <b>IRAN</b> <b>AS</b> A SUSPECT/CULPRIT  (for the first phase) and <b>IRAN</b> <b>AS</b> A WRONGDOER, <b>IRAN</b> <b>AS</b> A PATIENT and <b>IRAN</b> <b>AS</b> AN UNWANTED GUEST/A TRESPASSOR (as far as the second phase was concerned). The study concludes with the insight that the Western newspaper, among other things, stylistically and rhetorically employs and manipulates the metaphorical scenarios to justify and highlight the force and effectiveness of the West-backed sanctions against Iran and to render the country’s nuclear plans as illicit and unwarranted...|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{significance}} of the organization, proposals have occasionally been discussed to relocate its headquarters. Complaints about its current location include diplomats who find it difficult to obtain visas from the United States and local residents complaining of inconveniences whenever the surrounding roads are closed due to visiting dignitaries as well as the high costs to the city. A telephone survey in 2001 found that 67% of respondents favor moving the United Nations headquarters out of the country. Countries critical of the USA, such <b>as</b> <b>Iran</b> and Russia, are especially important in questioning the current location of the United Nations. Arguing that the United States government could manipulate the work of the General Assembly through selective access to politicians from other countries, with the aim of having an advantage over rival countries. Due to accusations of espionage by the United States, the subject of the relocation of the UN headquarters was again discussed, this time for security reasons.|$|E

The multi-use Salt Lake Stadium, also known as Yuva Bharati Krirangan, is India's largest stadium by seating capacity. The Calcutta Cricket and Football Club is the second-oldest cricket club in the world. Kolkata's Netaji Indoor Stadium served as host of the 1981 Asian Basketball Championship, where India's national basketball team finished 5th, ahead of teams that belong to Asia's basketball elite, such <b>as</b> <b>Iran.</b> The city has three 18-hole golf courses. The oldest is at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club, the first golf club built outside the United Kingdom. The other two are located at the Tollygunge Club and at Fort William. The Royal Calcutta Turf Club hosts horse racing and polo matches. The Calcutta Polo Club is considered the oldest extant polo club in the world.

5|$|The Buccaneers {{won their}} first playoff game in team history by holding the Eagles to 48 rushing yards, while running back Ricky Bell {{recorded}} 142 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns. Bell's 38 rushing attempts set a playoff record, tied later by John Riggins in Super Bowl XVII, while the Eagles' Wilbert Montgomery {{was held to}} 35 yards on 12 attempts. The Buccaneers' opening drive resulted in a Bell touchdown, and a Neil O'Donoghue field goal gave the Buccaneers an early 10–0 lead. Wally Chambers forced a Montgomery fumble that was recovered by Randy Crowder on the 4-yard line and led to Bell's second touchdown run, giving the Buccaneers a 17–0 second-quarter lead. Trying to extend that lead before halftime, Doug Williams hurried a pass that {{wound up in the}} hands of Eagles linebacker Jerry Robinson at the Tampa Bay 11-yard line. This set up Ron Jaworski's touchdown pass to Charles Smith. After the Eagles narrowed the gap to 17–10 on a Tony Franklin field goal, a series of Lee Roy Selmon sacks of Jaworski killed the Eagles' rally. A 9-yard touchdown pass to Jimmie Giles completed the Buccaneers' scoring. It was only in the final minutes of the game that the Eagles were able to put together a long drive, ending in a touchdown pass to Harold Carmichael. The Buccaneers held the ball for over 36 minutes of the game. The Buccaneers' defensive strategy revolved around stopping Carmichael and Montgomery. At one point, when Leroy Harris was gang-tackled following a short reception, the entire Buccaneer defense was penalized for unnecessary roughing. The Buccaneers' hard-hitting play intimidated the Eagles' receivers into dropping 10 passes. Going into the matchup, the Eagles were expected to have edges in playoff and quarterback experience. Jaworski was the third-rated quarterback in the NFC, while Williams had the lowest rating of all NFC starting quarterbacks. The game represented a rematch of old coaching rivals, McKay of USC and Dick Vermeil of UCLA. The game was the Buccaneers' first on national television. Word of the upset spread as far <b>as</b> <b>Iran,</b> where the hostages were surprised to learn of the Buccaneers' contention for the Super Bowl.|$|E
