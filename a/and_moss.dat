5|$|Adult mecopterans {{are mostly}} scavengers, feeding on {{decaying}} vegetation {{and the soft}} bodies of dead invertebrates. Panorpa raid spider webs to feed on trapped insects and even the spiders themselves, and hangingflies capture flies and moths with their specially modified legs. Some groups consume pollen, nectar, midge larvae, carrion <b>and</b> <b>moss</b> fragments. Most mecopterans live in moist environments; in hotter climates, the adults may therefore be active and visible only for short periods of the year.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} from September 7 to October 8, 1999, a 25-day {{shooting}} schedule. Pearce was on set every day during filming, although all three principal actors (including Pantoliano <b>and</b> <b>Moss)</b> only performed together the first day, shooting exterior sequences outside Natalie's house. All of Moss' scenes were {{completed in the}} first week, including follow-up scenes at Natalie's home, Ferdy's bar, and the restaurant where she meets Leonard for the final time.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, {{guests at}} the new hotel watched the wreck and rescue efforts of the United States Life-Saving Service for the Norwegian bark Dictator. The ship's figurehead, which washed {{up on the beach}} several days later, was erected as a {{monument}} to the victims and rescuers. It stood along the oceanfront for more than 50 years. In the 21st century, it inspired the pair of matching Norwegian Lady Monuments, sculpted by Ørnulf Bast and installed in Virginia Beach <b>and</b> <b>Moss,</b> Norway.|$|E

5|$|Irataba {{moved on}} to Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., where he earned great acclaim; {{government}} officials and military officers lavished him with gifts of medals, swords, and photographs. In Washington he met with President Abraham Lincoln, who gave him a silver-headed cane. He was the first Native American from the Southwest to meet an American president. The tour ended in April, when he <b>and</b> <b>Moss</b> sailed to California, again by way of Panama, and made {{their way back to}} Beale's Crossing from Los Angeles by wagon.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} old-growth forests with tree species and genera such as black oak, hickory, beech, cherry birch, sweetgum, red maple, and tuliptree. The forests also contain owls, bats, chipmunks, groundhogs, gypsy moths, rabbits, raccoons, opossums, coyotes. In addition, over 130 species of {{butterflies}} {{can be found}} in the park. In 1937, it was noted that the marshlands had fauna such as red-winged blackbirds, yellowthroats, green bottle flies, beetles, dragonflies, tadpoles, herons, kingfishers, and ospreys. Its flora included cattail, skunk cabbage, <b>and</b> <b>moss.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{sets were}} {{rendered}} digitally, {{and almost all}} of the sets had some form of digital enhancement. The largest digital environment was the Devetashka cave, which had to be digitally recreated because of the environmental concerns of filming explosions in the real cave. Using over 5,000 photographs taken at different times of day, the cave was accurately illuminated and rendered down to crevices <b>and</b> <b>moss.</b> The cave's interior containing a concealed nuclear vault was subjected to several changes up to two months before the effects' delivery date based on editorial input, including modifications to its scale. The railcar used within the cave was also digitally built alongside a practical version, but the digital versions versatility saw it largely replace its practical counterpart. The scene featuring the Expendables and prisoners trapped in the cave were shot entirely on Chroma key with the cave background inserted later.|$|E

5|$|The King Island emu was the {{smallest}} of all emus, and had darker plumage than the mainland emu. It was black and brown, and had naked blue skin on the neck, and its chicks were striped like those on the mainland. The subspecies was distinct from the likewise diminutive Kangaroo Island emu (D. n. baudinianus) {{in a number of}} osteological details, including size. The behaviour of the King Island emu probably did not differ much from that of the mainland emu. The birds gathered in flocks to forage and during breeding time. They fed on berries, grass and seaweed. They ran swiftly, and could defend themselves by kicking. The nest was shallow, and consisted of dead leaves <b>and</b> <b>moss.</b> Seven to nine eggs were laid, which were incubated by both parents.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} opened in 1879 as a halt on the Smaalens Line, {{now known as}} the western branch of the Østfold Line. The station {{building}} was designed by the Norwegian architect Peter Andreas Blix in the same Swiss cottage style as the stations Ås and Såner. In the 1950s, the station was frequently used by weekend guests from Oslo that visited the nearby conurbation Hvitsten for having a bath. A few years after the section of the Østfold Line between Ski <b>and</b> <b>Moss</b> Station was upgraded to double tracks, Vestby Station received a major renovation. A regulation plan for the station area was published in May 2010, which involved increasing the number of car parking places.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} different microhabitats in a wood; coniferous forest, broad-leafed forest, open woodland, scattered trees, woodland verges, clearings and glades; tree trunk, branch, twig, bud, leaf, flower and fruit; rough bark, smooth bark, damaged bark, rotten wood, hollow, groove and hole; canopy, shrub layer, plant layer, leaf litter and soil; buttress root, stump, fallen log, stem base, grass tussock, fungus, fern <b>and</b> <b>moss.</b> The greater the structural {{diversity in the}} wood, the greater the number of microhabitats that will be present. A range of tree species with individual specimens of varying sizes and ages, {{and a range of}} features such as streams, level areas, slopes, tracks, clearings and felled areas will provide suitable conditions for an enormous number of biodiverse plants and animals. For example, in Britain {{it has been estimated that}} various types of rotting wood are home to over 1700 species of invertebrate.|$|E

5|$|With {{nearly a}} decade of {{full-time}} band activity come to a rest, the Daddies parted ways to pursue other musical endeavors, remaining active in various local bands. Perry <b>and</b> <b>Moss</b> formed the theatrical glam punk group White Hot Odyssey, releasing an album on Jive Records in 2004 and later becoming a regular opening act for the Daddies' local concerts until their disbandment in 2005. Dan Schmid and keyboardist Dustin Lanker formed the piano rock trio The Visible Men, recording two independent albums and touring extensively throughout the Northwest in the early and mid-2000s, while Lanker worked steadily as a touring member of the California ska punk band Mad Caddies. Drummer Tim Donahue, after a stint with The Visible Men, worked as a session musician, recording on albums for artists including TobyMac and Shawn McDonald and playing in Yngwie Malmsteens band for his 2001 European tour.|$|E
5|$|Temperature: The species {{appears to}} require the cool, mild {{temperatures}} and relatively constant conditions provided by the waterfalls and the mist they generate. Water volume and flow rates within the Chittenango Creek watershed influence {{the size of the}} waterfall as well as the mist-zone and the actual temperature at the site. Active Novisuccinea chittenangoensis are generally found at temperatures from 12 to 20°C. During warmer periods, snails retreat to cool areas provided by the moist rock <b>and</b> <b>moss,</b> or aestivate in the vegetation. During cold winter temperatures, it is believed that the snails at the Falls retreat into cracks or fissures in the rocks and remain inactive. Various temperature readings were gathered during the summers of 1980-1982. In the spray zone, the rock surface temperatures averaged 16°C, the moss averaged 14°C, and the combined temperatures of the substrate, water, and vegetation averaged 16°C. Seasonal and daily temperature variation has been monitored for 2 years using data loggers that record temperature every hour, but this data has not yet been analyzed (Breisch, unpublished data).|$|E

25|$|Chigurh then ruthlessly tracks Moss down.

Then Moss runs and the chase/shootout begins. As Chigurh <b>and</b> <b>Moss</b> face off in the hotel and the streets, they are interrupted by a group of Mexicans, all of whom Chigurh kills.
