Syftet med studien är att försöka förstå och förklara vad medarbetarsamtalet betyder ur de anställdas perspektiv, och samtidigt vill vi måla upp en bild över vilka förutsättningar som karaktäriserar det “goda” medarbetarsamtalet. För att uppnå detta syfte, är studiens mål att besvara tre huvudsakliga forskningsfrågor: (1) vad är den anställdes perspektiv på medarbetarsamtal, (2) finns det förutsättningar som den anställde lägger särskilt vikt vid när han/hon beskriver medarbetarsamtal, och (3) vad utgör det goda medarbetarsamtalet. Studien genomfördes med kvalitativa intervjuer med ett urval av respondenter på totalt sex personer. Resultatet av empirin analyserades med hjälp av ett teoretiskt ramverk, som i det här fallet utgörs av: Wilhelmsson’s lärande dialog och Vygotskij’s proximala utvecklingszon. Det resultatet visar, är att det finns en dominerande syn bland de anställda att medarbetarsamtalet handlar om att få feedback. Även kontakten till chefen lyfts fram som en faktor för hur väl samtalet kan utspela sig. Avslutningsvis förs en diskussion där resultatet relateras till den tidigare forskningen på ämnet, pedagogiken som en vetenskaplig forskningstradition, samt implikationer för vidare forskning.  This study {{deals with}} employee’s {{perspectives}} on performance appraisal interviews, at a smaller sales company. The {{purpose is to}} explain, and gain a bigger {{understanding of what the}} performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>interview</b> is to the employee. Another goal is to line out which aspects that makes up for a “good” performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>interview.</b> For this purpose, the main focus of the study is to answer three main questions: (1) employee’s perspectives on performance appraisal interviews, (2) are there any specific conditions that the employee attaches when he or she describes the performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>interview,</b> and (3) what constitutes a “good” performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>interview.</b> The study was conducted by doing qualitative interviews with six employees. The material gathered from the interviews, were analyzed with relevant theories on learning. In this case: Wilhelmsson’s the learning dialogue, and Vygotskij’s zone of proximal development. The results show that there is a dominant view among the employees that the performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>interview</b> is mainly about getting feedback. It also shows that the employees suggest that the relationship with the boss affects the performance appraisal interview’s output. Finally there is a discussion where {{the results of this study}} are being compared to previous research on the subject, and what implications there is for conducting further research within the field of pedagogy. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{creative}} project (4 hrs) {{which will}} be undertaken by the student is entitled Performance <b>Appraisal</b> <b>Interview</b> Skills: A Communicative Perspective. This study examines {{the problem of the}} professional practice of performance appraisal programs that have been typified as relatively ineffective. A lack of effective communication skills {{on the part of the}} appraiser/interviewer contributes to the dissatisfaction arising from the performance appraisal process. While improvement of rapport establishment and listening skills is believed to be a means for increasing effectiveness in such a program, it cannot expect to bring about total effectiveness. The value and significance of this project is that there exists a need for improving communication skills within the context of a performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>interview.</b> A large majority of American organizations conduct performance appraisal programs. By enhancing managerial rapport establishing and listening skills, this project attempts to increase the effectiveness of performance appraisal interviews. This project contributes to the field of research concerning communication skills in interviewing as well as the field of human resource management. The method {{which will be}} used to conduct this creative project is two fold. The first three sections produce insight into the importance of performance appraisal interviews, in human resource management and the identification of two key communication skills in performance appraisal interviews. The last section is the creation of a training and development module for enhancement of key communication skills in performance appraisal interviewing. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|E

40|$|Performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>interviews</b> play {{a crucial}} role in {{internal}} communication. Most of the research on performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>interviews</b> has focused on strategic aims and interview design, but less attention has been given to the way in which performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>interviews</b> actually take place. In this study, the focus will, therefore, be to investigate how one of the crucial and most delicate activi-ties in performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>interviews,</b> namely, giving critical feedback, is conducted. The way crit-ical feedback is given is predominantly through negative assessments. The results indicate that there is an orientation to critical feedback as a socially problematic action despite the institutional char-acter of the talk. Moreover, it can be seen that the more the supervisor shows an orientation to nega-tive assessments as being socially problematic, the more difficult it becomes for the employee to deal with negative assessments. The study ends by outlining various implications for the workplace...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{predictors}} of performance appraisal attitudes and perceptions among supervisory and non-supervisory employees were examined. The {{data were collected}} from 1380 supervisory and non-supervisory employees working in 7 ministries of the Federal Public Services-Malaysia. A questionnaire was used to measure respondents’ perceptions regarding appraisal determinants: performance evaluation criteria, purposes of performance appraisal, <b>appraisal</b> <b>interview,</b> disclosure of annual assessment report, limitation of performance appraisal, and frequency of performance appraisal. Results of MEANS and ANOVA indicated that supervisors compared to non-supervisors were significantly more satisfied with performance appraisals and described their appraisals in more favorable terms. These significant differences between supervisors and non-supervisors reactions toward performance appraisal could have important implications for the design and implementation of appraisal systems in Malaysian public sector organizations...|$|E

40|$|Performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>interviews</b> remain {{central to}} how {{employees}} are scrutinised, rewarded and sometimes penalised by managers. But {{they are also}} often castigated as ineffective, or even harmful, to both individuals and organisations. Exploring this paradox, we highlight the influence of agency theory on the (mal) practice of performance appraisal. The performative nature of human resource management increasingly reflects an economic approach within which its practices are aligned with agency theory. Such theory assumes that actors are motivated mainly or only by economic self-interest. Close surveillance is required to eliminate the risk of shirking and other deviant behaviours. It is a pessimistic mind-set about people that undermines the supportive, co-operative and developmental rhetoric with which <b>appraisal</b> <b>interviews</b> are usually accompanied. Consequently, managers often practice <b>appraisal</b> <b>interviews</b> while holding onto two contradictory mind-sets, a state of Orwellian Doublethink that damages individual learning and organisational performance. We encourage researchers to adopt a more radical critique of appraisal practices that foregrounds issues of power, control and conflicted interests between actors beyond the analyses offered to date...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the topic}} of {{leadership}} is increasingly becoming an area of interest for discourse analysts, {{most of the studies}} on leadership discourse focus on business meetings and largely ignore other institutional contexts. This paper aims to address this gap by exploring leadership discourse in another important but often neglected genre, namely the performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>interview.</b> Drawing on naturally-occurring performance appraisal interviews recorded in a medical lab, we explore the particularly salient and (from a linguistic perspective) largely under-researched leadership activity of gate-keeping. This leadership activity is central to performance appraisal interviews and evolves around the conjoint negotiation of meaning and the co-construction of institutionalisable answers as they are ‘fixed’ by means of note taking. Through an in-depth analysis of how these leadership activities are performed in three performance appraisal interviews, this paper contributes {{to an understanding of the}} complex processes through which leadership is actually enacted on the micro-level of interactions in this increasingly relevant genre of institutional discourse...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of {{a health}} <b>appraisal</b> <b>interview</b> reveals how an {{interviewer}} employs to organize talk about a patient's medical history. When selected reportings by patient are paraphrased, a three-part is initiated: (1) interviewer's formulated understandings, (2) patient's confirmation, and (3) topic shift by interviewer. The reenactment of this interactional pattern promotes increasing attention to patient's adverse experiences as "root problems" underlying adult health status (e. g. molestation, obesity, depression). Creating an environment for patient's emergent disclosures is facilitated by displaying non-judgmental sensitivity to patient's stated concerns, soliciting alignment to particular reconstructions and avoidance of moving the interview forward prematurely and to issues not grounded in patient's illness circumstances. The identification and utilization of communication techniques for attending to patient's bio-psycho-social history is critical for refining understandings of empathic interviewing, enhancing diagnosis and treatment (e. g. referrals), decreasing patients' utilization of health care systems, and ultimately reducing costs for quality medical care.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} a labeling bias against behavior modification in work organizations. Groups {{of individuals in}} favor or opposed {{to the use of}} behavior modification in industry were formed. The identical videotape of a performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>interview</b> was shown to these subjects after half of each group had received a humanistic, and the other half a behavior modification, description of the videotape's contents. The 2 × 2 (Label × Attitude) analyses of variance revealed no evidence of a labeling bias. Although both method and leadership characteristics were rated more positively when the videotape was said to be descriptive of humanistic techniques, a significant Label × Attitude interac-tion emerged. The failure to yield any labeling bias is contrasted with previous research, while the need for a more "humanistic " terminology in describing behavioral programs is emphasized. Behavior modification has struggled to achieve popular acceptance within psychology (Lazarus, 1977). This issue is of some importance, since it may influence the extent to which professionals in differen...|$|E
40|$|The {{digitalization}} of Swedish preschools can {{be shown}} by three different indicators. First, the on-going revision of the national curriculum for preschool where children’s digital competences will be added. Second, the research about how digital devices (e. g. tablets) are used in preschools (e. g. Kjällander & Moinian, 2014; Petersen, 2015). Third, the introduction of learning management systems (LMS) designed for preschools. In a recent article, preschool principals in Swedish municipalities are shown to be the group of principals with the largest amount of employees (Hägström, 2017, March). Therefore, this study’s aim {{is to get a}} better understanding in which way preschool principals experience that they can use their LMS in conjunction with performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>interviews</b> with their employees. Four research questions have been developed: (1) How do principals describe their use of a LMS?, (2) What do they experience the system give insight in and what not?, (3) To which extent do they regard that the performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>interviews</b> change while using a LMS? and (4) Which ethical dilemmas do preschool principals experience by using a LMS for performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>interviews?</b> Five preschool principals in one southern Swedish municipality have been interviewed. All respondents have been using their learning management system for performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>interviews.</b> The results have been analyzed by activity theory, in particular Engeström’s (2001, 2015) activity system and his cycle of expansive learning (Engeström, 1999, 2001). The findings show that preschool principals are part of an activity system with both resources and limitations. Resources by delegating tasks and discussing and sharing in groups, while their decisions can be limited by national laws and municipal orders. In this activity system, the learning management system can be used both as a communication and an administration tool to realize two of the principals’ outcomes with performance appraisal interviews: to increase the speech time for the employees and to give them possibility to see their own professional development...|$|R

Key words: performance appraisal, stress, gender differences Performance appraisal is the mechanism by which organisations seek to assess and develop staff, thereby enhancing performance and distributing rewards (Fletcher, 2001). Several writers (Delahaye, 2005; Fisher, Schoenfeldt and Shaw, 1999; Lee, 1996) have suggested that there are two basic purposes for performance appraisals in organisations – developmental and administrative. Administrative reasons for performance appraisal include making decisions for salary increments, promotions and retrenchments and these appraisals are predominantly retrospective in nature...|$|E
40|$|The <b>appraisal</b> <b>interview</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{ubiquitous}} features of life in organisations. It is also one of the most ridiculed. Evidence mounts each year that most such interviews are poorly managed, fail to improve organisational performance, demoralise employees, and subject the managers who administer them to intolerable levels of stress. No wonder that one researcher, unkindly but accurately, has described them as ‘the annual fiasco’ (Pickett, 2003, p. 237). It is typical of the data that a conference of human-resources professionals found over 90 % of those present declaring that, if given the chance, they would modify, revise, or even eliminate the performance appraisal system currently used in their organisations (HR Focus, 2000). Thus, appraisal interviews are governed by some seemingly impregnable assumptions that research nevertheless suggests may be invalid – such as that organisations are rational entities, administrative systems are highly reliable, and most people can be trained to be unbiased and candid in their assessments of others (McCauley, 1997). Some have even argued that traditional appraisals are so inherently dysfunctional that they need to be abolished (e. g. Coens & Jenkins, 2000). Their continuing popularity represents another instance of hope triumphing over experience...|$|E
40|$|All GPs are {{required}} to undergo formal revalidation and appraisal. Revalidation and re-accreditation assess past performance {{with a view to}} licensing future activity. GP trainers have additional responsibilities for delivering high quality education to tomorrow's doctors beyond those of a GP. In order to fulfill this role trainers {{are required}} to attend re-accreditation courses by their local educational establishments and will have different needs to those of their doctor role. Course organizers have responsibilities that include the organisation and assurance of quality of the training provided by their scheme. Although there are no absolute definitions of good quality teaching, it is widely accepted that proxy measures for both consulting and teaching are important and definable. In the case of teaching registrars, these include provision for welcoming, inducting and informing new registrars, assessing their needs, and providing a climate in which they can flourish, as well as actually teaching them. This toolkit explores a system of appraisal designed to help trainers achieve these tasks efficiently, using structured feedback from registrars as well as the trainers' own reports as a basis for discussion during an <b>appraisal</b> <b>interview.</b> It contains some hints for interviewers and comments on the likely issues to emerge, as well as the basic tools needed to conduct the process. The toolkit can be adapted for local use. It has been well received by the trainers, and refined in the light of their feedback...|$|E

40|$|The <b>appraisal</b> <b>interview</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{ubiquitous}} features of life in organisations. It is also one of the most ridiculed. Evidence mounts each year to the effect that most such interviews are poorly managed, fail to improve organisational performance, demoralise employees and subject the managers who administer them to intolerable levels of stress. No wonder that one researcher, unkindly but accurately, has described them as ‘the annual fiasco’ (Pickett, 2003, p. 237). It is typical of the data that a conference of human resources professionals found over 90 % of those present declaring that, if given the chance, they would modify, revise or even eliminate the performance appraisal system currently used in their organisations (HR Focus, 2000). Thus, appraisal interviews are governed by some seemingly impregnable assumptions that research nevertheless suggests may be invalid – e. g. that organisations are rational entities, administrative systems are highly reliable, and most people can be trained to be unbiased and candid in their assessments of others (McCauley, 1997). Some have even argued that traditional appraisals are so inherently dysfunctional that they need to be abolished altogether (e. g. Coens and Jenkins, 2000). Their ongoing popularity represents another instance of hope triumphing over experience. This chapter therefore offers a different perspective to that often found in the literature, particularly practitioner guides that instruct on ‘how to’. Firstly, I define what appraisal interviews are and outline the range of roles they are expected to perform. Flowing from this, the voluminous evidence that indicates why appraisals generally fail to work is reviewed. It would be tempting to outline a series of steps and skills that appear to avoid these problems, as many texts do (e. g. Bacal, 2003; Sandler and Keefe, 2003). However, the conclusion offered here is that such piecemeal perspectives are more likely to compound the problem than resolve it. In particular, it is argued that most people are inherently poor at receiving criticism. We are so sensitive to it that even if critical feedback forms only a small part of the appraisal process it is likely to be regarded by the recipient as representative of the entire interview. The evidence clearly suggests that when such perceptions arise they derail the main intended point of the <b>appraisal</b> <b>interview</b> – which is to improve performance. But we are also poor at giving accurate criticism or feedback more generally. For example, managers are inclined to exaggerate the personal contribution that people make to negative outcomes and under-estimate the role of systems in producing poor performance (Gray, 2002). There is no compelling reason to believe that training or any other intervention will so improve the attitude of most people to either giving or receiving critical feedback that appraisal interviews will become effective for most people in most organisations in the near future. This chapter therefore outlines a framework to move organisations beyond appraisal interviews, and in the direction of both self appraisal and counselling interviews that, with sufficient support, are more likely to create a regular celebration of positive performance rather than the annual fiasco mostly endured today...|$|E

This study compared the health, functional status, and two-year mortality rates of community-dwelling rural elderly with serum cholesterol < 150 mg/dl to age- and sex-matched controls with serum cholesterol 200 - 240 mg/dl. Methods. Self-reported disease history, disability, health habits, and cognitive function data were collected at a health risk <b>appraisal</b> <b>interview.</b> A single blood sample was also collected and analyzed for total serum cholesterol at a central lab. Results. Of the 3, 874 participants, 109 (2. 8 %) had total cholesterol levels < 150 mg/dl. Seventy-five percent of the low cholesterol group were male compared to 44 % in the main study population. The low cholesterol group had significantly greater smoking history, current cigarettes smoked, diabetes history, angina and COPD symptoms, and assistance needed for heavy and light work. Men in the low cholesterol group had significantly lower blood pressure. After two years, 14 (12. 8 %) of the low cholesterol group had died vs 16 (7. 3 %) in the control group. There was no relationship to specific causes of death and cholesterol level. Conclusion. A very low cholesterol level in older individuals should be evaluated carefully to determine whether it is due to genetic or life-style factors such as diet or, more likely, is a marker of disease. LOW cholesterol {{has been associated}} with increased mor-bidity (1 - 3) and mortality (4 - 7). It has also been associ-ated with increased cancer risk (8 - 22). Few studies hav...|$|E
40|$|A {{portfolio}} of supporting information (SI) reflecting a doctors entire medical practice {{is now a}} central aspect of UK appraisal for revalidation. Medical revalidation, introduced in 2012, is an assessment of a doctors competence and passing results in a five yearly license to practice medicine. It assesses of a doctors professional development, workplace performance and reflection and aims to provide assurance that doctors are up-to-date and fit to practice. The dominant assessment mechanism is a portfolio. The content of the revalidation portfolio has been increasingly prescribed and {{the assessment of the}} SI is a fundamental aspect of the appraisal process which ultimately allows Responsible Officers (ROs) to make recommendations on revalidation. ROs, themselves doctors, were the first to undergo UK revalidation. This qualitative study explored the perceptions of ROs and their appraisers about the use of this {{portfolio of}} evidence in a summative revalidation appraisal. 28 purposefully sampled London ROs were interviewed following their revalidation appraisal and 17 of their appraisers participated in focus groups and interviews. Thematic analysis was used to identify commonalities and differences of experience. SI was mostly easy to provide but there were challenges in gathering certain aspects. ROs did not understand in what quantities they should supply SI or what it should look like. Appraisers were concerned about making robust judgements based on the evidence supplied. A lack of reflection from the process of collating SI and preparing for appraisal was noted and learning came more from the <b>appraisal</b> <b>interview</b> itself. More explicit guidance must be available to both appraisee and appraiser about what SI is required, how much, how it should be used and, how it will be assessed. The role of SI in professional learning and revalidation must be clarified and further empirical research is required to examine how best to use this evidence to make judgments as part of this type of appraisal...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{drawing on}} the work of Michel Foucault, I argue that {{academics}} are enmeshed in power relations in which confession operates, both on and through academics. Drawing on Foucault’s genealogy of confession, I illustrate how academics are not only invited to reflect on performance, faults, temptations and desires in their work and private life, but as teachers they mobilise the same kind of technology in relation to students. These power relations are connected to wider changes in society, where discourses on New Public Management have become all pervasive in organising and governing public institutions. The examples of the use of <b>appraisal</b> <b>interviews</b> and logbooks as governing techniques illustrate how government currently operates through the freedom of the individual. The paper ends with a discussion on how books of life could introduce a different relation of the self to the self in academia, and thus provide opportunities to live the present otherwise. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{exploratory}} research, {{as part of}} a three-stage study, into the use of a Group Support System (GSS) – the Zing Team Room (ZTR) – to enhance interpersonal communication between supervisor/managers (raters) and employee/functionaries (ratees) during performance appraisal interviews. A view of performance review is proposed which portrays how the substance of communication acts elicits tacit knowledge. Here participants, as a partnership, employ techniques to dialogue individual or organisational performance issues. The ZTR is seen as a vehicle which supports joint efforts to co-create meaning. Each anticipates and responds to the questions raised or reflects and deliberates on the answers given by the other. In this way the intent on achieving negotiated commitment to action is captured and made explicit. The ideal of two-sided agreement, and mutual accord being achieved in appraisal interviews is revisited, in this paper, but not from the standpoint of conventional performance review methods. Received wisdom holds that management’s interest in the now familiar structured or semi-structured <b>appraisal</b> <b>interview,</b> while historically a function of ‘control’ over employee performance, may in fact have diminishing value. Notwithstanding much of the disillusionment with respect to performance review procedures reported in the research literature, there is an increasing indication that the rules of engagement between managers and employees are changing inexorably. For some time theorists have suggested alternative systems of thinking concerning organisational performance issues based on perspectives of social equity and propriety. It is argued, for instance, that systems of enablement or empowerment (negotiated or otherwise) are more in keeping with complex adaptive systems theory and chaos theory. Chaos theory contends that ‘control’ as a central principle of performance management is illusory since uncertainty, change, and discontinuity are constant. Through the lens of social constructivism, a workable approach to describing the appraisal partnering process is explored as an alternative to conventional performance review procedures...|$|E

This qualitative study aims to build {{an understanding of how}} line managers at Kansanshi conduct performance appraisal interviews and what enablers and barriers they face in this process. In pursuit of the research aim, line managers from all the ten departments of the mine were considered as eligible for the study. Using stratified random sampling, ten of the 30 line managers from all ten departments across the mine site were selected. A total of fifteen semi-structured, in-depth, face-to-face interviews were conducted with ten line managers to gather data. These individual interviews were conducted on the mine site in the interviewees' offices as well as other convenient places such as the Kansanshi main boardroom. On average, each interview took between 45 to 60 minutes. All these interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and thereafter analyzed using open coding and constant comparison technique to induce themes. Findings of the study show a variety of barriers and enablers of line managers in their conduct of performance appraisal interviews at Kansanshi mine in Zambia. All ten line managers unanimously highlighted that (a) lack of clear job descriptions and set of individual targets as well as (b) lack of adequate refresher training on how to conduct performance appraisals affected how they conducted performance appraisals. Eight of the ten line managers highlighted that (c) perceived subjectivity of the system while seven of the ten highlighted that (d) predominant production focus and priority were barriers to them in how they conducted performance appraisals. On the other hand, ten line managers highlighted that (a) top management commitment to the implementation of a performance appraisal system, seven highlighted that (b) employees' hope for rewards and five line managers highlighted that (c) spring for career development and progression were perceived as enablers in their implementation of performance appraisals. This research is of value as it highlights how the conduct of performance is not only impacted by organizational support and other complementary organizational systems but also how the barriers to the conduct of performance appraisals affect both the appraisee and the appraiser...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2004. Stress {{is placed}} upon {{anything}} that is given special emphasis or significance, especially where this leads to, or involves, psychological, emotional and physical strain or tension. A {{part of it is}} therefore subjective, in that different reactions are produced in different individuals by the same set of circumstances. Stress is caused by a combined physical and psychological response to stimuli (stressors) that occur or are encountered during the course of living. The study will look at causes of stress and workplace stress and its impact on female employees' performance. Stressors from a general perspective will be identified. Further, workplace stress will be dealt with in detail using the integrated stress framework. The study will also look at effects on employees of negative feedback on self, as for example when a hierarchical superior in the course of an <b>appraisal</b> <b>interview</b> states that performance is unsatisfactory. The study will orientate towards a few questions such as: to what extent are individual well-being and performance similarly affected by stressors of various kinds, and to what extent to their effects appear to be distinct? What are the social and organizational conditions which give rise to the immediate stressors, and what qualities of personality and interpersonal relations mitigate the effects of stress? Creating workplaces that work for women and why the 'bottom-line' benefits workplaces that attract women are important components of this study. Further, organisations that target female consumers or clients is increasingly important as more women are entering the workforce and their spending power and disposable income continues to grow. To ensure a successful market focus on women, employers will want women employees to be a critical component of their organization. However, the mere presence of women in the workplace will not guarantee positive outcomes. What is required is a variety of best practice changes to ensure a work culture in which diversity is valued and effectively leveraged for better performance. A self-administered questionnaire will then be sent out to respondents to get their views on the effects of stress that they have felt in the past 12 months and how they rate their workplaces. Their views will also be sought on performance management issues and how to improve their performance management systems. A holistic approach which incorporates stress management into company health and i safety policies is viewed as the optimal strategy of this study...|$|E
40|$|Against a {{backdrop}} of new public management (NPM) thinking and managerialism generally applied to universities {{in a range of}} countries, this study examines one of its manifestations – performance management for academics. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 40 academics at an Australian university, this article identifies six stances regularly adopted by those conducting performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>interviews</b> with academics. These are labelled ‘nurturing’, ‘hard-driving’, ‘self-serving’, ‘coddling’, ‘disengaged’ and ‘hostile’. Each of these appraisal stances is described in detail and then considered from two perspectives – that of academics themselves and of NPM. The material presented suggests that while a ‘nurturing’ stance was viewed favourably by the academics interviewed, it is out of step with NPM thinking. ‘Hard-driving’ and ‘self-serving’ stances, which directly reflect NPM thinking, were disliked by many (although not all) of the interviewees who had experienced them. The most common appraising stance – a ‘disengaged’ one – was widely condemned, as was the ‘hostile’ stance, yet both stances have much in common with the ruthlessness of NPM. 18 page(s...|$|R
40|$|In sports, {{there is}} an {{extensive}} interest in identifying and selecting talented children {{in order to develop}} elite adult athletes. The process of selecting and screening talents involves not only physical and technical skills but also efforts to find adequate personality traits. Therefore, different types of performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>interviews</b> (PAIs) are becoming increasingly common within the field. Departing from fieldwork in two selection camps for Swedish youth national teams in soccer and hockey, we will {{take a closer look at}} the PAIs employed during these camps. This article takes on a narrative approach, emphasizing PAI as a narrative genre and a framework for a specific form of interaction. Our findings show how eligibility is performed in interaction through following three practices: (i) showcasing gratitude without tipping into flattery, (ii) using temporality as a way of displaying developmental potential, and (iii) adopting the role of the self-reflecting subject. This genre of interviews not only produces certain practices but also preferred subject positions and narratives. The PAI is thus a narrative genre where the players are encouraged to perform talent in order to appear selectable...|$|R
40|$|Indonesian {{legislation}} {{calls for}} a zero-burning policy. This approach to fire management is largely in response to significant negative impacts {{on the economy and}} the environment, not only in Indonesia but also the neighbouring region, that result annually from peat fires in Kalimantan and Sumatra. In this context, the present paper investigates the local use and management of fire in Flores and Sumba islands in eastern Indonesia. Our appraisals show that people's livelihoods depend on fire to maintain grasslands and, therefore, that the national policy and legislation for zero-burning is inappropriate and needs to be revised. This follows from the fact that not all fires cause damage and are unwanted. Through a series of rapid rural <b>appraisal</b> <b>interviews,</b> we found that the fires in grasslands are often lit intentionally to maintain the grasslands that local people use to sustain a variety of livelihood activities such as cattle rearing, hunting and farming. Although fires can damage or destroy remnant dry forests in eastern Indonesia, in order to be effective, future policy formulations need to account for this human livelihood dimension and the geographic variation in fuels, climate and land use...|$|R
