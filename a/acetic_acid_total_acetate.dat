40|$|Bacterial wetwood is a {{major cause}} of value loss in the red oak lumber {{industry}} in the United States. Red oak trees in Mississippi, South Carolina, and Florida were sampled and evaluated for certain chemical properties possibly associated with the wetwood condition. Specific variables investigated were pH and concentmtions of methane, cations (Na+. Ca++, K+, and Mg++). nonstructural carbohydrates, and organic acids (acetate, propionate, and butyrate). The degree of bacterial wetwood infection and development was greater in red oaks from Mississippi than from South Carolina as evidenced by increased concentrations of methane, total Na+, total K+, total Ca++, and by decreased concentrations of total sugar and reducing sugar. Of all the variables tested, methane concentration was the best indicator of wetwood in living red oak trees at all three locations. pH was not an indicator of wetwood in living trees or in green red oak lumber.

However, there are other sources of readily fermentable substrate and positive effects of adding cereal grains to wet silages have been reported. An experiment was carried out to study the contribution of hemicellulose, cellulose and natural or added starch to the silage fermentation process, and in vitro digestibility and gas production. A crop of lucerne (10 % blooming) was chopped, inoculated with lactic acid bacteria, and ensiled in microsilos with four treatments: alone (T 0), or with 50 kg/t of sucrose (SU), barley (BRL), or maize (MZ). Microsilos were incubated for 47 days. Polysaccharide recovery {{was determined by the}} mass balance technique, and starch by dacron bag. Except for SU, all treatments were apparently limited by the amount of WSC needed to sustain good silage fermentation.

40|$|Supported {{precious}} metal catalysts preparation usually includes two major steps, namely, {{the production of}} the ceramic support and its impregnation with the active species {{in the form of a}} salt solution, followed by a heat treatment. Alternatively, the active species can be incorporated simultaneously with the preparation of the support by combustion synthesis, which is a straightforward technique to produce homogeneous submicron crystalline oxide ceramic powders without the intermediate decomposition and/or calcination steps. In the present work, 0. 5 and 1 wt. % of metallic palladium was incorporated through the impregnation technique in commercial Alcoa A- 16 alumina and in alumina prepared by combustion synthesis. Moreover, alumina + Pd mixed powders, with the same nominal compositions, were prepared in a single step by combustion synthesis. All alumina-supported Pd catalysts are shown to be effective in ethanol oxidation reaction to <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> The catalytic performance was investigated in terms of selectivity to <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> and <b>total</b> conversion of ethanol as a function of temperature (up to 200 degreesC). The effect of the addition of PdO on the sintering behavior and catalytic performance changes when the incorporation technique is changed. The results obtained suggest that, with impregnation, the metal remains outside the alumina grains and densification mostly occurs by diffusion along grain boundaries. On the other hand, during combustion synthesis the metal is highly dispersed and higher temperatures are required to activate diffusion through the bulk of the grains. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

No shoots and roots were grew. This was due to the increase of electrical conductivity (EC) or electrolyte leakage caused by the high permeability of the damaged membrane of seed. The EC of control treatment was 11 μS/cm g, compared to 10 and 20 % treatment of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> were 36 μS / cm g and 55 μS / cm g EC respectively.

40|$|<b>Acetic</b> <b>acid</b> {{fermentability}} {{of various}} compounds from beech wood as produced in a two-step hot-compressed water treatment was evaluated by fermentation tests using standard compounds with Clostridium thermoaceticum and Clostridium thermocellum. For cellulose- and hemicellulose-derived products, the former microorganism {{was found to}} ferment compounds with low molecular weights such as monosaccharides, decomposed products, and organic <b>acids</b> to <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> while the latter was found to ferment compounds with high molecular weights such as polysaccharides and oligosaccharides to <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> Lignin-derived products were, on the other hand, fermented by both microorganisms to <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> Based on these lines of evidence, co-culture with C. thermoaceticum and C. thermocellum was evaluated and proven to increase <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> fermentability. Consequently, almost all compounds produced from beech wood in hot-compressed water {{were found to be}} converted to <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> when using these microorganisms in combination. Thus, hot-compressed water treatment coupled with <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> fermentation would likely be a powerful method to produce <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> from lignocellulosics...|$|R
40|$|<b>Acetic</b> <b>acid</b> {{tolerance}} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is crucial for}} the production of bioethanol and other bulk chemicals from lignocellulosic plant-biomass hydrolysates, especially at a low pH. This study explores two evolutionary engineering strategies for the improvement of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> {{tolerance of}} the xylose-fermenting S. cerevisiae RWB 218, whose anaerobic growth on xylose at pH 4 is inhibited at <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations > 1 g L(- 1) : (1) sequential anaerobic, batch cultivation (pH 4) at increasing <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations and (2) prolonged anaerobic continuous cultivation without pH control, in which acidification by ammonium assimilation generates selective pressure for <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> tolerance. After c. 400 generations, the sequential-batch and continuous selection cultures grew on xylose at pH≤ 4 with 6 and 5 g L(- 1) <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> respectively. In the continuous cultures, the specific xylose-consumption rate had increased by 75 % to 1. 7 g xylose g(- 1) biomass h(- 1). After storage of samples from both selection experiments at - 80 °C and cultivation without <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> they failed to grow on xylose at pH 4 in the presence of 5 g L(- 1) <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> Characterization in chemostat cultures with linear <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> gradients demonstrated an acetate-inducible <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> tolerance in samples from the continuous selection protocol...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a series}} of pH {{controlled}} batch fermentations operated in a fed-batch mode and adaptation and selection techniques where pH and <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> provided the selective pressures, we isolated a culture of Clostridium thermoaceticum that can grow and produce <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> at pH 4. 5. At pH 4. 5 the fastest mass doubling time was 36 h, and the highest <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration reached was 4. 5 g/liter. Generally, as the pH was decreased from 6. 0 and the initial <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration increased, the mass doubling time increased, and the final <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration decreased. These observations can be {{explained in terms of}} inhibition by the free <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration at a given pH, relative to the <b>total</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration (free acid plus acetate ion). We have thus reached one of the criteria determined by us to be required for an economically viable fermentation <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> process, i. e., pH 4. 5. A second requirement for a mass doubling time of about 7 h (0. 1 /h dilution rate) can probably be reached by selection in continuous culture. The final requirement for an <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration of 50 g/liter will be the most difficult to achieve in view of the organism's sensitivity to low concentrations of free <b>acetic</b> <b>acid...</b>|$|R

Weak <b>acids</b> such as <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> and formic acid are troublesome inhibitors restricting efficient microbial conversion of the biomass to desired products. To improve our understanding of weak acid inhibition, and to identify engineering strategies to reduce <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> toxicity, the highly acetic-acid-tolerant yeast Zygosaccharomyces bailii was studied. The impact of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> membrane permeability on <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> tolerance in Z. bailii was investigated with particular focus on how the previously demonstrated high sphingolipid content in the plasma membrane influences <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> tolerance and membrane permeability. Through molecular dynamics simulations we concluded that membranes with a high content of sphingolipids are thicker and more dense, increasing the free energy barrier for the permeation of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> through the membrane. Z. bailii cultured with the drug myriocin, known to decrease cellular sphingolipid levels, exhibited significant growth inhibition in the presence of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> while growth in medium without <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> was unaffected by the myriocin addition. Furthermore, following an <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> pulse, the intracellular pH decreased more in myriocin-treated cells than in control cells. This indicates a higher inflow rate of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> and confirms that the reduction in growth of cells cultured with myriocin in the medium with <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> was due to an increase in membrane permeability, thereby demonstrating the importance of a high fraction of sphingolipids in the membrane of Z. bailii to facilitate <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> resistance; a property potentially transferable to desired production organisms suffering from weak acid stres...|$|R
