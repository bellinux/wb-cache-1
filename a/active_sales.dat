The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate if Brazilian companies that have the highest rates of employees’ work satisfaction expressed through the organizational climate, have also had the best financial performance indicators. In order to accomplish this purpose a research was conducted so as to establish a link between financial indicators and the organizational climate of the enterprises that have presented the highest rates of organizational climate during the years of 2004, 2005 and 2006, assessed by Você S/A – Exame Guide, published by Editora Abril. The financial indicators used were: Return Rate on Total Assets, Return on Equity, Net Margin, Operating Margin, Sales Growth, Asset Turnover and the <b>Active</b> <b>Sales</b> per Employee index, obtained from the “FIPECAFI’s Melhores e Maiores” database. The statistical tests applied were the Shapiro Wilks, the Mann-Whitney´s or the test “t” and the multidimensional scaling. The conclusion is that the best companies to work for didn’t have significatively superior financial performance when compared with other researched companies.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} aimed at {{providing}} {{an overview of the}} development and current situation of the county newspaper Lääne Elu, in order to assist the editorial staff in maintaining the role of the community paper also in the future. Lääne Elu (“Western Life”), established in 1989 in the county of Läänemaa, is a privately owned independent newspaper. The paper {{was among the first to}} introduce modern practices of newspaper journalism as well as Western journalistic values in Estonia, successfully defeating the previous county paper in fierce competition. For the last 15 years, the newspaper has had a monopolistic position in its native community. This thesis researched the changes in the readership and the extent of target audience coverage of Lääne Elu, juxtaposing the results with those of other Estonian county newspapers. Data from Estonian market research companies was used for this purpose. Interviews with opinion leaders in the county helped chart the expectations that the populace of Läänemaa has of the community newspaper. Interviews with the founder of the paper and the journalist with the longest tenure reflected the changes in the organisation of the work of and the values held high by the editorial staff throughout the period of the paper’s publication. Using content analysis, shifts in the extent of classical newsworthiness within the context of general news, as well as the topics of the general news’ headlines were observed. In addition, structural changes in the composition of the editorial staff were monitored. The study reveals that within its scope and readership, Lääne Elu is capable of fulfilling the role of the community paper — the newspaper is read by 2 / 3 of the adult population of the county, the highest indicator of its kind among Estonian county papers. Yet, in recent years, readership of the paper outside the county has steadily grown, and already more than a quarter of the readers only access the online edition. This is a challenge to the editorial staff, as systematic development of the online edition and <b>active</b> <b>sales</b> of advertising to this medium have yet to be initiated. The paper is read more by senior residents of Läänemaa; propagation of the newspaper is the smallest among the youths. Quality of the general news stories in accordance to their newsworthiness has grown throughout the years, while the scope of topics in the headlines of these stories has mostly stayed the same. Local politics, history, native culture and public order are dominant among the topics, yet important issues like subsistence and agriculture are almost absent. Throughout the years, the manpower of the newspaper, including the editorial staff, has dwindled. Many journalists have gone on to work for nation-wide media channels; finding replacements has been complicated. The ability of the editorial staff to shape opinions has diminished, as has the frequency of intra-paper discussions. The interviews suggested that the newspaper, while boasting a strong news section, has regressed in the area of opinions and feature stories. The thesis demonstrates to the owners and the editorial staff of “Lääne Elu” the challenges the paper as a community periodical is facing...|$|E

Neste contexto, este estudo teve por objetivo {{investigar}} como as organizações contábeis do município de São Paulo estão utilizando o planejamento estratégico na sua gestão. O estudo fundamenta-se através de uma revisão bibliográfica sobre as características das organizações contábeis, bem como sobre os conceitos que norteiam o processo de planejamento estratégico. Para atingir este objetivo, foi realizada uma pesquisa exploratória quantitativa, junto às organizações contábeis do município pesquisado. Para a coleta de dados, foi elaborado e utilizado como instrumento de pesquisa um questionário com 50 questões. O critério de amostragem foi por conveniência, utilizando-se para análise a estatística descritiva e ferramentas não-paramétricas com o auxílio do software SPSS. Em complemento a esta pesquisa quantitativa, foi realizada uma pesquisa qualitativa com base em entrevistas estruturadas, utilizando-se a análise de conteúdo para a classificação das categorias semelhantes. Os resultados obtidos de ambas as pesquisas revelaram que a maioria das empresas pesquisadas entende a importância do planejamento estratégico e têm uma percepção positiva das razões, benefícios e vantagens gerados pela sua utilização, contudo não o vêm praticando. A pesquisa quantitativa também demonstrou outro lado positivo: apesar de 98 % das empresas não estarem praticando o planejamento estratégico no momento, 92 % têm a intenção de colocá-lo em prática, o que pode alterar a constatação, já verificada em outras pesquisas, de que as organizações contábeis pouco contribuem ao apoio gerencial utilizado no processo decisório dos seus clientes. The {{relation between}} the organizational climate and the financial performance has been studied by several researchers who have emphasized {{that there could be}} reciprocity between the organizational climate and the enterprise performance. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate if the Brazilian enterprises that reached the highest rates of work satisfaction, demonstrated by theirs employees and expressed by their organizational climate, have also demonstrated the best indicators of financial performance. In order to accomplish this purpose, a research was made about the financial indicators of the enterprises that have presented the highest indices of organizational climate in the years of 2004, 2005 and 2006 and were classified by the Guide VOCÊ S/A - EXAME, published by EDITORA ABRIL. This research has only included the enterprises that are mentioned in that magazine list as well as in the list "Melhores e Maiores da Revista EXAME", which present the best and the biggest Brazilian enterprises, according to this magazine. In this context, forty enterprises were selected from which twenty were classified by the Guide VOCÊ S/A-EXAME, being among the first ten enterprises in the years 2004, 2005 e 2006 and they were compared with twenty other enterprises which were part of that guide. An study was done to determine if the enterprise participation in that magazine list, showing a high value index would result in a better financial performance. For this purpose, the following indicators were used: Rate of Return on Total Assets, Return on Equity, Net Margin, Operating Margin, Sales Growth, Asset Turnover and the <b>Active</b> <b>Sales</b> per Employee. These index values were obtained from the database " Melhores e Maiores da FIPECAFI". The statistical tests of Shapiro Wilks were applied firstly.

40|$|The current {{rules for}} {{corporate}} taxation in Europe do not longer fit the globalized economic activities. Taxing corporate income {{on a national}} level leads to many tax obstacles for European multinationals. European multinationals, for example, face high compliance costs, suffer limitations to cross-border loss compensation and have to deal with transfer pricing issues. In an attempt to provide a comprehensive solution for the underlying tax obstacles that currently harm the international competitiveness of European multinationals, the European Commission (EC) launched a proposal for a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base directive (EC, 2011). The proposal includes one set of tax rules, allowing multinationals to calculate a common consolidated corporate tax base on a group level. The consolidated tax base would then be reapportioned to the different group members by means of an apportionment formula, which includes the factors <b>active,</b> <b>sales</b> and labour. The Member States preserve the right to apply their own tax rate to their specific share of the consolidated tax base. This dissertation contributes to the rather limited academic research concerning CCCTB. The core aims are (i) to explore the design of the European apportionment formula, (ii) to investigate the EU apportionment formula regarding the role of intangible assets in Belgium and (iii) to attain insights in the voting behaviour of the Members of the European Parliament (MEP). In the first study we focus on the design of the European apportionment formula, which {{plays a major role in}} Member States’ concern for protecting their tax revenue, as well as for the multinational companies’ tax minimizing opportunities. More specifically, we investigate the effect of changing the number of factors that make up the formula and the weight given to each factor. We used unpublished firm level data from a listed multinational, which enabled us to study the factor definitions in detail. Our simulation results indicate that including more factors and applying more equal weights distributes the consolidated tax base more equally, which reduces tax planning opportunities. Moreover, for our multinational, using more simplified factors definitions does not change the allocation of the consolidated tax base to a great extent. This advocates the inclusion of simplified factor definitions to reduce the compliance costs for multinationals. In the second study we focus on the factor assets in the apportionment formula. Namely, it is the commission’s intention to only partly and temporarily include intangible assets into this factor. The main reason for this is that the inclusion of intangibles could create tax planning opportunities for multinationals caused by location and valuation issues. However, excluding intangible assets from the apportionment formula could lead to an unfair distribution of the consolidated tax base. Member States that invest highly in a more knowledge-based economy, would lose taxable income they are entitled to. We empirically investigate this issue in a Belgian context. More precisely, using firm specific data from the Belfirst database, we investigate the profit generating capacity of both the proposed allocation factors, i. e. tangible fixed assets, sales and labour, as well as the additional allocation factor, viz intangible assets. Our results show that intangible assets, defined as the sum of ‘capitalized R&D costs’ and ‘concessions, patents and licences’, have a significant and positive impact on the creation of profit. We also include the factor capitalized R&D costs separately and find a positive and significant contribution of this factor to the generation of profit. In addition, our results show both the formula adding intangible assets to the proposed allocations factors, and the formula adding capitalized R&D costs, perform significantly better than the formula only including the proposed factors. Moreover, the formula adding intangible assets is more precise in explaining profit than the formula including capitalized R&D costs. The proposal for a CCCTB directive concerns a decision about direct taxation, meaning that the consultation procedure is applied. This procedure implies that the final decision rests with the Council of the EU and that the European Parliament plays a consultative role. In April 2012, the Member of the European Parliament approved the amended CCCTB proposal (452 votes in favour, 172 against and 36 abstentions). The third study gives insight into the voting behaviour of MEPs concerning the CCCTB directive. We focus on the question whether or not the voting behaviour of MEPs is influenced by the economic impact of CCCTB for their country. The economic impact of CCCTB is measured through the impact of CCCTB for each MS on their corporate income tax revenue. We collected the voting results from the independent organization VoteWatch Europe. Our results show that a higher impact of CCCTB on the corporate income tax revenue, increases the likelihood of a MEP to vote in favour of the proposal. As a robustness check we also measured economic impact by using the impact on employment and GDP. Again, we find that MEPs are significantly and positively influenced in their voting behaviour by the impact of CCCTB on employment and GDP for their country. Finally, we find that political party and country variables also have a significant effect on the voting behaviour of MEPs, whereas the individual characteristics of MEP did not have a significant influence...|$|E
