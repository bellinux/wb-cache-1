5|$|At 3:54p.m. BST on 23 July 2011, two {{ambulances}} {{were called}} to Winehouse's home in Camden, London. Winehouse was pronounced dead at the scene. Shortly afterwards, the Metropolitan Police confirmed that she had died. <b>After</b> <b>her</b> <b>death</b> was announced, media and camera crews appeared, as crowds gathered near Winehouse's residence to pay their respects. Forensic investigators entered the flat as police cordoned off the street outside; they recovered one small and two large bottles of vodka from her room. <b>After</b> <b>her</b> <b>death,</b> the singer broke her second Guinness World Record: for the most songs by a woman to simultaneously appear on the UK singles chart, with eight.|$|E

50|$|As a young girl, she {{was raised}} and spoiled, <b>after</b> <b>her</b> mother's <b>death,</b> by <b>her</b> grandmother, Vivian Carlson.

5|$|A {{significant}} {{transition in}} her posthumous reputation occurred in 1833, when her novels were republished in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering, and {{sold as a}} set. They gradually gained wider acclaim and popular readership. In 1869, fifty-two years <b>after</b> <b>her</b> <b>death,</b> her nephew's publication of A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced a compelling version of her writing career and supposedly uneventful life to an eager audience.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>her</b> <b>death,</b> 116-year-old Marie-Louise Meilleur {{became the}} oldest {{recognized}} living person.

5|$|Along {{with other}} family members, Virginia Clemm and Edgar Allan Poe lived {{together}} {{off and on}} for several years before their marriage. The couple often moved to accommodate Poe's employment, living intermittently in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. A few years after their wedding, Poe was involved in a substantial scandal involving Frances Sargent Osgood and Elizabeth F. Ellet. Rumors about amorous improprieties on her husband's part affected Virginia Poe so much that on her deathbed she claimed that Ellet had murdered her. <b>After</b> <b>her</b> <b>death,</b> her body was eventually placed under the same memorial marker as her husband's in Westminster Hall and Burying Ground in Baltimore, Maryland. Only one image of Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe has been authenticated: a watercolor portrait painted several hours <b>after</b> <b>her</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E

5|$|Anna Maria Luisa's {{single most}} {{enduring}} act was the Family Pact. It ensured {{that all the}} Medicean art and treasures collected over nearly three centuries of political ascendancy remained in Florence. Cynthia Miller Lawrence, an American art-historian, argues that Anna Maria Luisa thus provisioned for Tuscany's future economy through tourism. Sixteen years <b>after</b> <b>her</b> <b>death,</b> the Uffizi Gallery, built by Cosimo the Great, {{the founder of the}} Grand Duchy, was made open to public viewing.|$|E
5|$|Arnold {{was very}} close to his mother, who died in 1759.

5|$|Cameron's {{recognition}} {{as an artist}} increased <b>after</b> <b>her</b> <b>death,</b> when her paintings made appearances in exhibitions across the U.S. As a result of increased attention on Parsons, Cameron's life also gained greater coverage in the early 2000s. In 2006, the Cameron–Parsons Foundation was created to preserve and promote her work, and in 2011 a biography of Cameron written by Spencer Kansa was published.|$|E
5|$|Cather's {{letter to}} Anderson {{can only be}} paraphrased by scholars, because she left a clause in her will forbidding the {{publication}} of her letters and private papers.
