40|$|Exchanges of {{switches}} is a {{time consuming}} and costly procedure that entails high risks for the contractor while the profit margin is low. The high cost is partly linked to the machine costs, where especially the cranes that lifts switchparts represent a major cost item. The cranes major drawback lies beyond the cost of these, in essence, the cranes can not perform any other activity than lifting, {{making it more difficult}} to reduce setup times. To reduce the cost of switch exchanges, this study intended to investigate the possibilities of using large construction machinery and, for the task specially adapted, a load distributing beam to lift the precast switch components. Construction machinery has historically been used to lift switches often without load distributing measures which can directly be contrary to the quality of deflection of the switch components, which the swedish transport administration regulations specify. Construction machinery can, unlike cranes, carry out other activities than just lifting where setup times are reduced and overall machine cost of the switch exchange should reduce. The study is thus designed to examine and clarify the conditions required for an alternative switch exchange method to be used. The conditions are based on the requirements that arise related to production, quality and contract aspects where the study also have included three traditionally utilized methods, gantry crane, rail-mounted crane and mobile crane. This is to enable to compare {{the pros and cons of}} the alternative method in comparison to the established switch exchange methods. The alternative method is also, along with the other switch exchange methods, tested against two real projects, the rebuilding of the meeting railyards Kaisepakte and Rensjön, with the intention to verify the study’s theoretically generated demand profiles. The study shows that the overall premise of using an alternative transmission shift method is based on the ability of the contractor to plan and prepare for using the method. Projects based on the swedish transport administration regulations and standards must create a good enough opportunity for the contractor to plan and prepare for the method. Which can be created by:• Continuity and sustainability of the client• Clearer quality requirements• Increased cooperation between client, contractor and construction planner• Focus on planningThe study of comparative analyzes also show that the switch exchange project have a tendency to change and comes with a high level of complexity, which makes it very difficult to argue that a single switch exchange method is fitted to meet the demands of all types of projects. Clear however is that the methods complement each other in regards to being able to master each other's weaknesses. The exception is the <b>alternate</b> <b>switch</b> exchange method and mobile cranes which impose similar requirements on the projects. Which could lead to the alternative method could be able to acquire the mobile cranes place as switch exchange method.

40|$|Previous {{research}} on task switching has been confounded by inhibitory control mechanism {{and there has}} been debate on the source of switch costs and how and when the inhibitory control occurs during task switching. In order to circumvent this problem, the thesis aimed to investigate the role of inhibition in task switching by examining <b>switch</b> costs, <b>alternating</b> <b>switch</b> costs and congruency effect in three tasks when two preparation intervals (short and long) are given. Task switching experiments in the present study captured both flexibility (changes in task) and anticipatory control (preparation interval between cue and target) and provided the measurement for inhibitory control, 'backward inhibition' by <b>alternating</b> <b>switch</b> cost. Backward inhibition was manifest in longer reaction times (and/or more errors) to <b>alternating</b> <b>switch</b> trials (ABA) than to double switch trials (CBA). Reaction time and error in the present study also reflected whether the task in the current trials were easy when it requires the same response as the task in the previous trials, i. e., whether the required response were congruent. The results in the thesis provided the strong evidence for switch costs as one of cognitive control mechanism and it was reduced by the long preparation interval through all the experiments. When the cues were arbitrarily matched for each task, switch costs were increased, suggesting that high working memory load and the effort for interpretation of the cues might cause more additional process during switching tasks. On the other hand, the change of the cue type was insensitive to backward inhibition since {{there were no significant differences}} on the size of <b>alternating</b> <b>switch</b> costs. The results imply that the occurrence of backward inhibition is more prone to the type of task you perform and level of congruency. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} chimera {{patterns}} can be induced by noise in nonlocally coupled neural {{networks in the}} excitable regime. In contrast to classical chimeras, occurring in noise-free oscillatory networks, they have features of two phenomena: coherence resonance and chimera states. Therefore, we call them coherence-resonance chimeras. These patterns demonstrate the constructive role of noise and appear for intermediate values of noise intensity, which is a characteristic feature of coherence resonance. In the coherence-resonance chimera state a neural network of identical elements splits into two coexisting domains with different behavior: spatially coherent and spatially incoherent, a typical property of chimera states. Moreover, these noise-induced chimera states are characterized by alternating behavior: coherent and incoherent domains switch periodically their location.

Once this limit is reached, power-constrained applications {{will face a}} cap on their maximum throughput independent of their level of parallelism.

40|$|Systematic {{error in}} the Long Trace Profiler (LTP) has become the major error source as {{measurement}} accuracy enters the nanoradian and nanometer regime. Great efforts {{have been made to}} reduce the systematic error at a number of synchrotron radiation laboratories around the world. Generally, the LTP reference beam has to be tilted away from the optical axis in order to avoid fringe overlap between the sample and reference beams. However, a tilted reference beam will result in considerable systematic error due to optical system imperfections, which is difficult to correct. Six methods of implementing a non-tilted reference beam in the LTP are introduced: (1) application of an external precision angle device to measure and remove slide pitch error without a reference beam, (2) independent slide pitch test by use of not tilted reference beam, (3) non-tilted reference test combined with tilted sample, (4) penta-prism scanning mode without a reference beam correction, (5) non-tilted reference using a second optical head, and (6) <b>alternate</b> <b>switching</b> of data acquisition between the sample and reference beams.

These disorders feature impaired bone marrow production of neutrophils along with excess monocytes—terminally differentiated lineages corresponding to the two alternative fates of myeloid progenitor cells. We utilized a modified yeast two-hybrid system and identified a new, widely expressed gene, N 2 N, whose product is homologous to Notch 2, that interacts with neutrophil elastase. N 2 N is a 36 -kDa protein distributed throughout the cell and secreted. Its amino-terminal sequence consists of several EGF repeats identical {{to those of the}} extracellular region of Notch 2, and its carboxyl terminus contains a unique 24 -residue domain required for interaction with neutrophil elastase. Neutrophil elastase cleaves N 2 N within EGF repeats in vitro and in living cells, but the C-terminal domain retards proteolysis. In vitro, N 2 N represses transcriptional activities of Notch proteins.

40|$|Abstract: Uninterruptible power {{supplies}} (UPS) {{play an important}} role in interfacing critical loads such as computers, communication systems, medical/life support system and industrial controls to the utility power grid. They are designed to provide clean and continuous power to the load under essentially any normal or abnormal utility power condition. Among the various UPS topologies such as online UPS, offline UPS and line interactive UPS, online UPS are widely used. In this paper hardware implementation of single phase 50 Hz, online uninterruptable power supply with over voltage, under voltage and phase out protection have been carried. Atmega 32 microcontroller is the heart of the system and controls entire system. By programming the microcontroller using embedded C, SPWM pulses to drive H-bridge are generated. By <b>alternating</b> <b>switching</b> switches of two legs of H-bridge alternating 9 V DC voltage is converted into 9 V Ac voltage.

At any instant if it detects that there is over voltage, under voltage or phase out, microcontroller acts to isolate the load from the power source by sending tripping signal to relay. Once relay isolates the load from the power source, microcontroller supplies the load through the charged battery.

40|$|The laminar to {{turbulent}} {{transition of}} a circular cylinder wake was investigated experimentally, examining a range of features leading to an aperiodic three-dimensional structure and a possible mechanism causing the route to turbulence was postulated. Following {{the analysis of the}} Stuart-Landau equations defining a Hopf bifurcation at the primary instability, a new relationship between the Strouhal number (St) and the Reynolds number (Re) was formed, providing agreement with a range of equations defined experimentally. The St-Re relationship was examined for a range of mechanisms modifying the cylinder's end termination and a variation in the free-stream turbulence level. It was ascertained that the end termination had a direct influence on the wake dynamics, producing a change in the wake structure leading to the possibility of parallel vortex shedding and also a modification of the critical Reynolds number. Following the introduction of specific boundary conditions, it was ascertained that the critical Reynolds number could be delayed to a value of 192. Although an increased level of free-stream turbulence demonstrated a reduction in the critical Reynolds number for all end conditions imposed. Within a small range of Reynolds numbers prior to transition, random wake irregularities identified within the laminar velocity signal. These were ascertained to be generated from finite three-dimensional perturbations within the wake, introduced by the method of end termination and the increased level of free-stream turbulence. Following the analysis of these intermittent aperiodic bursts within the transition regime, they were demonstrated to relate to the occurrence of turbulent flow prior to transition. This produced an <b>alternate</b> <b>switching</b> between the two states relating to the hysteretic bifurcation to the mode A wake structure.
