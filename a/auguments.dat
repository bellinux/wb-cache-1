40|$|Stepping {{back from}} current debates over {{immigration}} {{in the new}} 'Fortress Europe', this paper examines moral and philosophical <b>auguments</b> for an alternative and more 'progressive' immigration policy. Despite recent interest within geography in principles of social justice, {{the extent to which}} such principles reach beyond particular societies or nations has rarely been considered explicitly. The notion of social justice may be extended to the question of immigration, without taking the position that migration should itself be seen as a 'human right'. Even within relatively conservative contractarian and communitarian conceptions of social justice, a number of suggestions can be made for 'progressive' policy options, in particular by focusing on the communal rights and duties of societies rather than the human rights of individual migrants...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} clearly shown in our studies {{reported}} previously that a physiological dose of catecholamines (CA) <b>auguments</b> cardiac function, myocardial metabolism and coronary blood flow in normal heart, while deleterious effects {{are seen in}} the heart with coronary constriction. These different effects, benefical or deleterious, may be depend on the coronary blood flow (CBF) level. Therefore, {{this study was designed}} to establish the interrelationship between the CA effect on myocardial metabolism or cardiac function and CBF level, and to determine the critical CBF level in which CA produces myocardial ischemia. In 48 anesthetized open chest dogs, the main left coronary artery was cannulated with Griggs type cannula. CBF was measured with electromagnetic flow meter, and was reduced to the desired level (CBF 12 ? 88 ml/min/ 100 g) by means of graded constriction in the auto-perfused cannula circuit. The hemodynamic and metabolic measurements were performed before and after CBF reduction and following the intracoronary administration of 0. 2 μg/kg/min of adrenaline (Ad) or 0. 4 of noradrenaline (NA) for 5 minutes. (1) Coronary constriction resulted in a slight decrease of mean coronary blood pressure, Max dp/dt of left ventricle, myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO 2), coronary arterio-venous difference of lactate (AL), lactate extraction ratio (ΔL/La) and a slight elevation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) in proportion to the degree of CBF reduction. Myocardial potassium loss was found to be below CBF 40 ml/min/ 100 g. (2) CA markedly increased Max dP/dt of left ventricle, MVO 2, ΔL,ΔL/La, coronary arterio-venous difference of potassium and lowered LVEDP in dogs with CBF over 50 ml/min/lOOg. (3) Both NA and Ad resulted in a significant production of lactate and potassium loss from myocardium, elevation of LVEDP, and infarct like ST elevation (6 / 12 dogs) or significant ST depression (other 6 / 12 dogs) in dogs with CBF under 30 ml/min/ 100 g. From these findings, it was suggested that the critical CBF level, in which CA produces myocardial ischemia, might exist between 30 and 50 ml/min/ 100 g, and CA <b>auguments</b> or improves cardiac function and myocardial metabolism in dog hearts with CBF over 50, while accelerets myocardial ischemia in those with CBF under 30 ml/min/ 100 g...|$|E

40|$|The α(1) -antitrypsin (α(1) AT), which {{comprises}} {{more than}} 90 % of the protein {{content of the}} α(1) -globulin, inhibits a variety of enzyme. α(1) AT is the major trypsin inhibitor in human serum and has an important role as antiplasmin in fibrinolytic system. The experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of α(1) AT on fibrinolytic system, measuring serum α(1) AT levels and coagulative and fibrinolytic activities in man. The serum α(1) AT levels were measured in 30 controls, 93 cancer and 107 nonmalignant patients. They were also measured in the postoperative patients who were 7 cases of gastric cancer, 5 of lung cancer, 5 of breast cancer and 5 of cholelithiasis. The serum levels were measured by a single radial immunodiffusion plate (M-partigen) obtained from the Behring Institute. The results obtained were as follows: 1) The levels of α(1) AT were significantly increased in patients with lung cancer, gastric cancer and colon cancer, while those with breast cancer and thyroid cancer remained in normal range. There was a significant correlation between α(1) AT and the clinical stage of lung cancer and gastric cancer. Among nonmalignant patients, AT was significantly elevated in the inflammatory diseases such as lung abscess and hepatitis. 2) α(1) AT had the lowerest level {{at the end of}} operation and it exceeded the preoperative value and returned to preoperative level at the 14 th day. These changes of α(1) AT were observed both cancer and nonmalignant patients. The plasma fibrinogen levels showed a similar pattern to α(1) AT during postoperative period, whereas d(2) -macroglobulin had no significant changes. The concentration of plasma plasminogen and antithrombin III had been fallen below the preoperative levels by the 7 th day and returned at the 14 th day. Antitrypsin activities were increased to some extent by the 7 th postoperative day. These results suggest that the elevation of α(1) AT is closely related to two factors as follows: a) α(1) AT may increase to neutralize a certain leucocytic protease when leucocytes increase in body. b) The increase in α(1) AT might be due to regulating the plasmin which <b>auguments</b> in cancer, inflammation or postoperative patients, may induce release of antiplasmin whose activity is mainly dependent on α(1) AT...|$|E
