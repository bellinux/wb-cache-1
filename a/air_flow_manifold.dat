40|$|In {{this work}} {{we present a}} dynamic, control-oriented, {{concentrated}} parameter model of an open-cathode proton exchange membrane fuel cell system {{for the study of}} stability and efficiency improvement with respect to thermal management. The system model consists of two dynamic states which are the fuel cell temperature and the liquid water saturation in the cathode catalyst layer. The control action of the system is the inlet air velocity of the cathode <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>manifold,</b> set by the cooling fan, and the system output is the stack voltage. From the model we derive the equilibrium points and eigenvalues within a set of operating conditions and subsequently discuss stability and the possibility of efficiency improvement. The model confirms the existence of a temperature-dependent maximum power in the moderate temperature region. The stability analysis shows that the maximum power line decomposes the phase plane in two parts, namely stable and unstable equilibrium points. The model is capable of predicting the temperature of a stable steady-state voltage maximum and the simulation results serve for the design of optimal thermal management strategies.

30|$|In this paper, the 3 D {{model of}} the intake {{manifold}} is reconstructed using the inverse method and CATIA software. The applicability and authenticity of the model is ensured due to the actual shape of the engine intake <b>manifold.</b> The internal <b>flow</b> field of the manifold is analyzed by combining CAD, CATIA, and CFD software with FLUENT; in addition, the equation is established on the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> in the <b>manifold</b> and used in the SIMPLE algorithm. The calculation speed is accelerated through combining GAMBIT and FLUENT software, dividing the internal flow field of the intake manifold, and setting the boundary conditions. The {{results show that the}} optimized flow field is reasonable, the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> is higher, and the pressure is reduced to varying degrees in the manifold, which effectively reduces the intake resistance and helps to increase the intake manifold, especially in the main optimization position by comparing the internal flow field of the engine intake manifold and the optimized intake manifold.|$|R

40|$|During the {{amorphous}} ribbon production process, {{the mechanisms}} that cause uneven thickness and herringbone on two {{surfaces of the}} ribbon are very complicated. The high velocity rotating roller causes periodic air eddies near the surface and <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> around the contact zone. The <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> might be the major reason that causes the non-uniformity thickness and the ripples. In this paper, a two-dimension model was developed to simulate the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> eddies and a three-dimensional simulation was performed for the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> field around the puddle zone. Simulation {{results show that the}} higher velocity of <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> around the puddle edges is closely related to thicker ribbon rim. The continuous air eddies along the roller surface and the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> fluctuations along the roller width are the major reasons causing non-uniform convective heat transfer during ribbon solidification. The frequency of air eddy matches well with the nominal ripple frequency along the ribbon length, and the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> fluctuation coincides with the herringbone wavelength along the ribbon width.

40|$|The {{flat plate}} {{collector}} was produced for grain drying application. The performance {{tests were conducted}} with three type of <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> using various <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates. 1) Collector efficiency increases as <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates increase. Among three types of <b>air</b> <b>flow,</b> the order of efficiency is first, the reversed flow type, follwed by two-way flow type and the upper flow type. 2) The air temperature rise decrease as <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates increase. Especially in the reversed <b>flow</b> type, <b>air</b> temperature rise beyond 15 ℃ is attained when he average solar radiation is 1. 2 cal/cm²min. Thus, {{the results indicate that}} the reversed flow type offers the best performance of the three types of <b>air</b> <b>flow.</b> (2) The mathematical model of the solar collector was developed as one part of solar grain drying simulation. Simulation results for the temperatures of the absorbing plate,the cover and the air showed reasonable agreement with the experimental data. It was demonstrated that this model was reasonably valid for simulation studies of rise drying. (3) Then, the simulation model was used to predict collector performance. The results were as follows: 1) Temperatures of the absorbing plate rise with an increase in the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates and with a decrease in the collector area. 2) Air temperature is raised as <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates decrease and the collector area increases. 3) Collector efficiency increases with an increase in <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates. These conclusions agree well with the experimental results, showing that this model can be also used for the prediction of collector performance. (4) Simulation results showed the expression of the relationship between <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate and the energy collected to the each collection area. Thus, if <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate and collection area are assumed, energy collection can be calculated.
