25|$|One {{particular}} model, made by Pope Manufacturing Company in 1886, weighs 36lb (16kg), has a 60-spoke 53-inch (1.35 m) {{front wheel}} and a 20-spoke 18-inch rear wheel. It is fitted with solid rubber tires. The rims, frame, fork, and handlebars {{are made from}} hollow, steel tubing. The steel axles are mounted in <b>adjustable</b> <b>ball</b> bearings. The leather saddle is suspended by springs.|$|E
5000|$|Daniel Rudge (1840 [...] - [...] 26 June 1880) was a British {{engineer}} who built high-end bicycles and velocipedes. Rudge invented the <b>adjustable</b> <b>ball</b> bearing bicycle hub (British Patent No 526) in 1878.|$|E

5000|$|The Coupé is a {{mid-engined}} two-seater {{sports car}} {{designed to give}} outstanding performance for its time, and impeccable handling. The design composed of two Mini front subframes, with traditional Mini rubber cone suspension, linked by a sheet steel semi-monocoque chassis. The chassis' deep centre tunnel backbone is supplemented by two generous sills. The car is mid-engined: the rear subframe contained the engine as in a Mini with the steering arms locked in position with <b>adjustable</b> rods and <b>ball</b> joints. This is {{held in place by}} a 1" [...] square tubular space frame, {{all the way from the}} rear bulkhead. The front subframe carried the steering rack, fuel tank and radiator. Brakes and wheels remained as per the options available to the Mini, post April 1982 GTM coupes being designed to allow fitment of 13" [...] wheel.|$|R
40|$|A {{device for}} {{attaching}} an experiment carrier to {{a space station}} handrail is provided. The device has two major components, a clamping mechanism for attachment to a space station handrail, and a pointing carrier on which an experiment package can be mounted and oriented. The handrail clamp uses an overcenter mechanism and the carrier mechanism uses an <b>adjustable</b> preload <b>ball</b> and socket for carrier positioning. The handrail clamp uses a stack of disk springs to provide a spring loaded button. This configuration provides consistent clamping force over a range of possible handrail thicknesses. Three load points are incorporated in the clamping mechanism thereby spreading the clamping load onto three separate points on the handrail. A four bar linkage is used to provide for a single actuation lever for all three load points. For additional safety, a secondary lock consisting of a capture plate and push lock keeps the clamp attached to the handrail {{in the event of}} main clamp failure. For the carrier positioning mechanism, a ball in a spring loaded socket uses friction to provide locking torque; however. the ball and socket are torque limited so that the ball ran slip under kick loads (125 pounds or greater). A lead screw attached to disk spring stacks is used to provide an adjustable spring force on the socket. A locking knob is attached to the lead screw to allow for hand manipulation of the lead screw...|$|R
40|$|The article {{represents}} therapy of Bobath {{such as one}} of {{the most}} effective author method which use in correction psychomotor development of children with disorders of musculoskeletal system. Bobath method is not new in the correction of movement disorders since last century and still supplementing and improving. In this work highlight topic of the effective use Bobath therapy in correction of psychomotor development in children age 3 – 6 years with organic involvement CNS. the experiment was based on evaluation of psycho physical state of experimental before and after 10 days course neurodevelopment therapy in hospital. The positive dynamics of motor activity in main position (lying, sitting, standing), learning motor skills (turn to the side on belly, standing on one leg), are proved effectiveness of applying Bobath therapy in correctional psychomotor development children aged 3 - 6 years with organic lesions CNS. applying Bobath therapy in correctional injuries in children with organic lesions CNS and exploring such as it included many aspects and direction: treatment position (normalization of muscle tone and effect on pathological reflexes) use physical exercises with use special extras (Bobath chair, Bobath couch with <b>adjustable</b> inclined surface, <b>ball</b> for feet, triangle and rollers to ensure the adoption of the necessary provisions), Bobath logopedics (normalization oral praxis, regulation of oral control, normalization of articulation muscles tone, learn the self-service skills, personal hygiene, feeding, changing clothes...|$|R
50|$|A British firm, Schumacher Racing, was {{the first}} to develop an <b>adjustable</b> <b>ball</b> {{differential}} in 1980, which allowed nearly infinite tuning for various track conditions. At the time the majority of on-road cars had a solid axle, while off-road cars generally had a gear-type differential. Team Associated followed suit with the introduction of the RC100 1/8 scale gas on-road car, RC12 1/12 scale on-road electric car, and RC10 1/10 scale off-road electric racing buggy in 1984 (see below). Team Losi followed with the introduction of the JRX2 in 1988.|$|E
