5|$|Although Kane adamantly {{refused to}} share credit {{for many of}} his {{characters}} (and refuted Robinson's claim until Kane's death), many comic historians credit Robinson with the Joker's creation <b>and</b> <b>Finger</b> with the character's development. By 2011, Finger, Kane, and Robinson had died, leaving the story unresolved.|$|E
5|$|Assante and Banderas {{did their}} own singing, and studied {{to master the}} {{instruments}} their characters use in the film. Assante practiced on drums, preparing for {{a scene in which}} his character plays a musical number with Tito Puente. Banderas worked to mimic the correct posture <b>and</b> <b>finger</b> placements for his character's trumpet performances, while the actual playing was performed by Arturo Sandoval.|$|E
5|$|On January 7, 1989, Reagan {{underwent}} surgery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center {{to repair a}} Dupuytren's contracture of the ring finger of his left hand.

For this reason he had a hand <b>and</b> <b>finger</b> bandage the day of his farewell speech and the day of the inauguration of George H. W. Bush.|$|E

5|$|Simpson was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} brigadier on 11 September 1941, becoming the first officer of the Australian Corps of Signals to reach that rank. He was involved in a serious motor vehicle accident on 13 September 1941 and suffered severe lacerations, a concussion, and a broken collarbone, rib <b>and</b> <b>finger.</b> He was taken to the 2/1st General Hospital, and was evacuated to Australia on the hospital ship MS Wanganella. He returned to the Middle East by air, arriving back on 20 January 1942.|$|E
5|$|The final {{development}} in the modern design of the clarinet used {{in most of the}} world today was introduced by Hyacinthe Klosé in 1839. He devised a different arrangement of keys <b>and</b> <b>finger</b> holes, which allow simpler fingering. It was inspired by the Boehm system developed for flutes by Theobald Boehm. Klosé was so impressed by Boehm's invention that he named his own system for clarinets the Boehm system, although it is different from the one used on flutes. This new system was slow to gain popularity but gradually became the standard, and today the Boehm system is used everywhere in the world except Germany and Austria. These countries still use a direct descendant of the Mueller clarinet known as the Oehler system clarinet. Also, some contemporary Dixieland players continue to use Albert system clarinets.|$|E
5|$|Roberts {{switched}} to Dunlop tires for the 1982 season, as Goodyear {{pulled out of}} motorcycle racing. New competition had arrived as Honda entered their new two-stroke NS500 ridden by defending champion Lucchinelli, former 350cc world champion, Takazumi Katayama and newcomer Freddie Spencer. Roberts won the season-opening round in Argentina on the old square-four Yamaha, but then {{switched to}} the new OW61 YZR500 V4 engined bike. He came in third at the Austrian Grand Prix then, sat out the French Grand Prix at Nogaro as {{he and the other}} top riders boycotted the race over unsafe track conditions. Roberts then won the Spanish Grand Prix at Jarama ahead of Sheene, and scored a second place behind Suzuki rider Franco Uncini in the Netherlands. In a portent of things to come, Roberts was leading the Belgian Grand Prix when his Dunlop tires lost their grip and he had to settle for fourth place as Spencer went on to win his first Grand Prix for Honda. Roberts then injured his knee <b>and</b> <b>finger</b> at the British Grand Prix and had to miss the Swedish round, but by then the world championship had been claimed by Uncini with a total of five victories while Roberts fell to fourth place. By the end of the 1982 season, Roberts had won sixteen 500cc Grand Prix races, more than double that of any of his contemporaries.|$|E

5|$|The postcranial {{skeleton}} of Majungasaurus closely resembles those of Carnotaurus and Aucasaurus, {{the only other}} abelisaurid genera for which complete skeletal material is known. Majungasaurus was bipedal, with a long tail to balance out the head and torso, putting {{the center of gravity}} over the hips. Although the cervical (neck) vertebrae had numerous cavities and excavations (pleurocoels) to reduce their weight, they were robust, with exaggerated muscle attachment sites and ribs that interlocked for strength. Ossified tendons attached to the cervical ribs, giving them a forked appearance, as seen in Carnotaurus. All of these features resulted in a very strong and muscular neck. Uniquely, the cervical ribs of Majungasaurus had long depressions along the sides for weight reduction. The humerus (upper arm bone) was short and curved, closely resembling those of Aucasaurus and Carnotaurus. Also like related dinosaurs, Majungasaurus had very short forelimbs with four extremely reduced digits, first reported with only two very short external fingers and no claws. The hand <b>and</b> <b>finger</b> bones of Majungasaurus, like other majungasaurines, lacked the characteristic pits and grooves where claws and tendons would normally attach, and its finger bones were fused together, indicating that the hand was immobile. In 2012, a better specimen was described, showing that the lower arm was robust, though short, and that the hand contained four metatarsals and four, probably inflexible and very reduced, fingers, with small claws on the second and third finger. The phalanx formula was 1-2-2-1-0.|$|E

25|$|Meteorologists use radar {{to monitor}} {{precipitation}} and wind. It {{has become the}} primary tool for short-term weather forecasting and watching for severe weather such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, winter storms, precipitation types, etc. Geologists use specialized ground-penetrating radars to map the composition of Earth's crust. Police forces use radar guns to monitor vehicle speeds on the roads. Smaller radar systems are used to detect human movement. Examples are breathing pattern detection for sleep monitoring and hand <b>and</b> <b>finger</b> gesture detection for computer interaction. Automatic door opening, light activation and intruder sensing are also common.|$|E
