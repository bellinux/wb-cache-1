40|$|AbstractHydropathy plots {{are often}} used in place of missing {{physical}} data to model transmembrane proteins {{that are difficult to}} crystallize. The sequential maxima of their graphs approximate the number and locations of transmembrane segments, but potentially useful additional information about sequential hydrophobic variation is lost in this smoothing procedure. To explore a broader range of hydrophobic variations without loss of the transmembrane segment-relevant sequential maxima, we utilize a sequence of linear decompositions and transformations of the n-length hydrophobic free energy sequences, Hi, i= 1 … n, of proteins. Constructions of hydrophobic free energy eigenfunctions, ψl, from M-lagged, M×M autocovariance matrices, CM, were followed by their <b>all-poles,</b> maximum entropy power spectral, Sω(ψl), and Mexican Hat wavelet, Wa,b(ψl), transformations. These procedures yielded graphs indicative of inverse frequencies, ω− 1, and sequence locations of hydrophobic modes suggestive of secondary and supersecondary protein structures. The graphs of these computations discriminated between Greek Key, Jelly Role, and Up and Down categories of antiparallel β-barrel proteins. With these methods, examples of porins, connexins, hexose transporters, nuclear membrane proteins, and potassium but not sodium channels appear to belong to the Up and Down antiparallel β-barrel variety...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{iterative}} methods of image restoration are considered. These methods {{are based on}} the successive approximation algorithm with adaptive regularization and parametric constrains on the solution. The adaptive regularization preserves the global image smoothing and is considered as the combined nonlinear operator for simultaneous removal of additive Gaussian and impulse noises. The corresponded condition of iteration convergence is investigated. The adaptation strategy is based on the generalized noise visibility function which determines the pixel belonging to the flat arias or edges. Noise visibility function is considered as an indicator function and mathematically determined as the intersection of two additional binary images obtained from local variance estimation and edge image. Extending the previous work, it is proposed the new paprametric constrain on the solution in spatial frequency domain. Opposite the above mentioned regularization, which bounds from above the energy of the restored frequency components, the proposed adaptive frequency constrain determines the lower bound of the solution. The introduction of such constrain is conditioned by the inability of the classical regularized iterative algorithms with the existed constrains to restore the strongly depressed or missed frequency components. To overcome this disadvantage the parametric model of image spectrum is used. The model consists of the sum of 3 exponential decays to approximate the whole image magnitude spectrum using available information about low-pass frequency part of the degraded image. The proposed approach has the corresponded analogue in the spatial coordinate domain where well-known parametric model of maximum entropy method is used to obtain high spatial resolution. However, opposite maximum entropy model, which is mostly suitable for impulselike images due to its <b>all-poles</b> character, the proposed frequency parametric model has the higher level of generalization, because the exponential model describes the large amount of real image spectra. The performed computer simulation illustrates the high efficiency of the proposed technique on the examples of images degraded by defocusing...|$|R
50|$|Since {{the late}} 1970s, most non-musical vocoders have been {{implemented}} using linear prediction, whereby the target signal's spectral envelope (formant) is estimated by an <b>all-pole</b> IIR filter. In linear prediction coding, the <b>all-pole</b> filter replaces the bandpass filter bank of its predecessor and is used at the encoder to whiten the signal (i.e., flatten the spectrum) and again at the decoder to re-apply the spectral shape of the target speech signal.|$|E

5000|$|The {{disadvantage}} is {{that direct}} form II increases {{the possibility of}} arithmetic overflow for filters of high Q or resonance. [...] It {{has been shown that}} as Q increases, the round-off noise of both direct form topologies increases without bounds. [...] This is because, conceptually, the signal is first passed through an <b>all-pole</b> filter (which normally boosts gain at the resonant frequencies) before the result of that is saturated, then passed through an all-zero filter (which often attenuates much of what the <b>all-pole</b> half amplifies).|$|E

50|$|Introducing zeros, in this way, gives {{double the}} delay of an <b>all-pole</b> low pass filter, but the phase {{characteristic}} still retains the desired maximally flat feature.

5000|$|Alternatively, {{the values}} can be {{obtained}} by inspection of published tables. [...] Note, however, that the results in most of these tables are for normalised low-pass networks (<b>all-pole</b> networks) of 1 second delay, so using the given coefficient values directly in an all-pass expression will result in a circuit with a delay of 2 seconds.|$|E
50|$|If {{the system}} {{function}} has zeros {{as well as}} poles, they can be mapped the same way, but the result {{is no longer an}} impulse invariance result: the discrete-time impulse response is not equal simply to samples of the continuous-time impulse response. This method is known as the matched Z-transform method, or pole-zero mapping. In the case of <b>all-pole</b> filters, the methods are equivalent.|$|E
5000|$|For high-pass and {{low-pass}} (as well as band-pass filters {{far from}} the center frequency), the required rejection may determine the slope of attenuation needed, and thus the [...] "order" [...] of the filter.

The SP0256 generates speech with a 10 kHz sample rate. The SP0256 realizes its 12-pole filter {{with a series}} of cascaded 2-pole IIR filter sections. This is in contrast to its contemporaries, such as Texas Instruments LPC Speech Chips, which used an 8 kHz sample rate with a 10-pole model, and realized their VTM with a lattice filter.|$|E
50|$|In {{implementation}} of the source-filter model of speech production, the sound source, or excitation signal, is often modelled as a periodic impulse train, for voiced speech, or white noise for unvoiced speech. The vocal tract filter is, in the simplest case, approximated by an <b>all-pole</b> filter, where the coefficients are obtained by performing linear prediction to minimize the mean-squared error in the speech signal to be reproduced. Convolution of the excitation signal with the filter response then produces the synthesised speech.|$|E
50|$|One filter type used {{to model}} the {{auditory}} filters is the gammatone filter. It provides a simple linear filter, which is therefore easy to implement, but cannot by itself account for nonlinear aspects of the auditory system; it is nevertheless used {{in a variety of}} models of the auditory system. Variations and improvements of the gammatone model of auditory filtering include the gammachirp filter, the <b>all-pole</b> and one-zero gammatone filters, the two-sided gammatone filter, and filter cascade models, and various level-dependent and dynamically nonlinear versions of these.|$|E
5000|$|A second-order filter attenuates high {{frequencies}} more steeply. The Bode plot {{for this type}} of filter resembles that of a first-order filter, except that it falls off more quickly. For example, a second-order Butterworth filter reduces the signal amplitude to one fourth its original level every time the frequency doubles (so power decreases by 12 dB per octave, or 40 dB per decade). Other <b>all-pole</b> second-order filters may roll off at different rates initially depending on their Q factor, but approach the same final rate of 12 dB per octave; as with the first-order filters, zeroes in the transfer function can change the high-frequency asymptote. See RLC circuit.|$|E
30|$|Five {{existing}} alternative LP {{models were}} described, applied to tonal audio signals, and interpreted {{in terms of}} relieving the tradeoff inherent in the conventional LP model. The first three alternative LP approaches solve the frequency distribution problem by considering a model different from the low-order <b>all-pole</b> model, namely, a (constrained) pole-zero (PZLP) model, a high-order <b>all-pole</b> (HOLP) model, or a pitch prediction (PLP) model. Two other alternative approaches aim at improving the low-order <b>all-pole</b> model performance, by first transforming the input signal and hence altering the distribution of its tonal components. If an all-pass bilinear transform is used, {{we end up with}} the warped <b>all-pole</b> (WLP) model, whereas a linear frequency transform leads to the selective <b>all-pole</b> (SLP) model.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm to generate autoregressive random binary processes with predefined mean and predefined <b>all-pole</b> power spectrum, subject to specific {{constraints on the}} parameters of the <b>all-pole</b> spectrum. The process is generated recursively using a linear combination of the previously generated values to bias the genera-tion of the next value. It is shown that an all-zero filter whitens the process, and, therefore, the process has an <b>all-pole</b> spectrum. The process is also described using an ergodic Markov chain, which is used to determine the appropriate initialization and to prove conver-gence if the algorithm is not initialized properly.

40|$|A new {{distance}} {{measure for}} <b>all-pole</b> modeling of voiced speech is introduced in this paper. It {{can easily be}} integrated within the concept of discrete Weighted Mean Square Error (WMSE) <b>all-pole</b> modeling, by a suitable choice of the modeling weights. The proposed weighting will address the problems such as: harmonic estimation reliability, perceptual significance of the harmonic and the model mismatch errors. The robust estimator is proposed, to reduce the effect of outliers caused by spectral nulls or additive non-speech contributions (e. g. background noise or music). It is demonstrated that the proposed <b>all-pole</b> estimation can significantly improve the performance of speech coders based on sinusoidal model, since the harmonic magnitudes are modeled better by the WMSE <b>all-pole</b> model. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWeighted linear {{prediction}} (WLP) is {{a method}} to compute <b>all-pole</b> models of speech by applying temporal weighting of {{the square of the}} residual signal. By using short-time energy (STE) as a weighting function, this algorithm was originally proposed as an improved linear predictive (LP) method based on emphasising those samples that fit the underlying speech production model well. The original formulation of WLP, however, did not guarantee stability of <b>all-pole</b> models. Therefore, the current work revisits the concept of WLP by introducing a modified short-time energy function leading always to stable <b>all-pole</b> models.

40|$|The <b>all-pole</b> gammatone filter (APGF), {{which we}} derive by {{discarding}} the zeros {{from the popular}} gammatone filter (GTF), and the related <b>all-pole</b> filter cascade (APFC) provide models of auditory filtering with simple parameterization and useful properties. Compared to the GTF, these <b>all-pole</b> models offer fewer parameters, a more controlled behavior of the tuning-curve tail, and an easier way to model level-dependent gain, bandwidth, asymmetry, and center-frequency (CF) shift. The order-N APGF is the Nth power of a filter with one complex-conjugate pair of poles; the GTF has this same set of poles, but, in addition, has spurious zeros on the real axis that complicate its description and behavior. Since the APGF is the Nth power of a simple pole-pair filter, many of its properties—such as gain, bandwidth, delay, and dispersion—are easy to compute as analytic functions of the parameters, which may be tied to sound level or to output power level. Good approximate and empirical results extend these functions to the APFC, which is an efficient tapped filter-cascade structure that has a mathematical link to an underlying traveling-wave structure via the Liouville–Green (or WKB) approximation.
