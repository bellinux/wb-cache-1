5|$|In {{the sixth}} stage, Aucouturier, Garin and Dortignac escaped {{in the last}} kilometres. Aucouturier signed first at the control post in Ville-d'Avray. From that point, the race was neutralised until the velodrome Parc-des-Princes, where the riders would ride the final kilometre. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> the riders arrived in Paris, it started to rain. The organisers decided {{together}} with the cyclists to exclude the final kilometre from the race, and make the control post in Ville-d'Avray {{the end of the}} race. This made Aucouturier the winner of the stage. Maurice Garin finished second, which made him the overall winner.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} {{disagreement}} among classical rabbinical writers as to when the manna ceased, particularly in regard to whether it remained {{after the death of}} Moses for a further forty days, seventy days, or fourteen years; indeed, according to Joshua ben Levi, the manna ceased to appear <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> Moses died.|$|E
25|$|The four {{survivors}} were bitterly grieved by the loss, {{for they}} had grown into a band of brothers, and they swore to keep a sharp eye out for the Albatroses of Richthofen's squadron which had brought down Nash. At {{the same time they}} thought that Nash was dead. On the morning of June 27th they met the Richthofen Staffel near Courtrai, and this time Collishaw found himself engaged with the bright-green Albatros of Allmenröder – though he was not aware <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> he was fighting the conqueror of Nash. It was one of the classic dogfights of the war, like Barker against Linke, like Hawker against Richthofen – two skilled and experienced fighters, who knew every trick, had met.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} argued whether Anselm's {{reluctance}} to take the see was sincere or not. Scholars such as Southern and Kent maintain Anselm's honest preference was to remain at Bec. Anselm had initially considered becoming a hermit and, naturally drawn to contemplation, he likely would have cared little for such a political office {{at the best of}} times and disliked it all the more amid his own troubled age. Against this, Vaughn notes that feigned reluctance to accept important positions was a common practice within the medieval church, as open eagerness risked earning a reputation as an ambitious careerist. She further notes that his approach improved his negotiating position and that he finally acted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> gained him the greatest leverage in advancing the interests of his see and the reform movement within the church.|$|E
25|$|The remake {{version of}} the video is about a person who loses touch with himself. Originally full of life, the protagonist becomes a robot working a {{monotonous}} office job. One morning, he wakes up from a dream of a beautiful girl dressed in white on the beach. He leaves for work, and his buried alter egos, dressed in white shirts, black slacks, assorted ties and each holding either red or white roses, emerge mysteriously. At work, his boss gives him a stack of paperwork, which he does mechanically. Meanwhile, at home, the alter egos are {{in a circle around}} his coffee table, throw the roses in the center, and leave. Back at work, he prepares to go home, but is then given another stack of documents. His frustrations boil over, and he throws his tie at his boss. He runs home not knowing what he is running for, and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> he walks in the door, the last of the alter egos exits. He finds a white box that replaced his coffee table and is intrigued. He unwraps the red and white ribbons and opens the box to find himself on the beach with the same girl in his dream and the roses on the water.|$|E

25|$|The others leave but {{a moment}} later Poirot suffers a small {{collapse}} and has Margot fetch back Dr. Sheppard. Poirot recovers quickly and, asking the doctor his opinion of the night’s events, is accused of playing a comedy. Poirot disagrees and confirms that he knows who the murderer is and for them {{there can be no}} escape. He takes the doctor through his thinking: The mysterious telephone call can only be judged from its result, which is that Sir Roger’s death was discovered that night instead of the next day. That means that the murderer wanted to be on the spot when the discovery was made, perhaps to retrieve something. The second puzzling fact was the armchair pulled out from its normal place in the study and that can only have been to have hidden something from sight <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> the room was broken into. As the Dictaphone is missing, it can only be that item which was there and, by use of a time-lock, the voice heard behind the door was not that of the living Sir Roger but a previously-made recording – the man was already dead. The murderer can only be someone who had a receptacle to carry away the machine and who had the study to himself for a moment after the discovery of the body – in other word’s, Dr. Sheppard himself.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, a Japanese company from Watanabe's {{battalion}} infiltrated through {{a gap between}} {{the east side of the}} ridge and Parachute Company C. Deciding that their positions were now untenable, Parachute Companies B and C climbed onto the ridge and retreated to a position behind Hill 123. In the darkness and confusion of the battle, the retreat quickly became confused and disorganized. A few Marines began yelling that the Japanese were attacking with poison gas, scaring other Marines who no longer possessed their gas masks. After arriving behind Hill 123, some of the Marines continued on towards the airfield, repeating the word [...] "withdraw" [...] to anyone within earshot. Other Marines began to follow them. Just <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> it appeared that the Marines on the hill were about to break and head for the rear in a rout, Edson, Major Kenneth D. Bailey from Edson's staff, and other Marine officers appeared and, with [...] "vivid" [...] language, herded the Marines back into defensive positions around Hill 123.|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{is one of}} Naruto Uzumaki's {{signature}} techniques, {{invented by}} Tobirama Senju with the instructions placed in a forbidden scroll that Naruto was tricked into stealing by a ninja named Mizuki. Unlike regular clone jutsus, the Shadow Clones are physical clones of the user capable of cohabiting with their surroundings, performing jutsu, and engaging in battle before dispersing in {{a puff of smoke}} when sufficiently damaged or at the user's discretion. When clones are created, the user's chakra is evenly distributed among them, making it easy for the user to quickly expend their chakra. While most ninja limit themselves to only making a few clones because of this, Naruto can create thousands of clones due to his large amount of chakra. He can also combine it with his [...] "Sexy Jutsu" [...] to produce the [...] "Harem Jutsu". During Part II, having been unaware of this fact until Kakashi explains it, Naruto learns that any knowledge his clone possesses will be transferred to him <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> the jutsu is canceled. This fact enables Naruto {{to make use of the}} Jutsu in training to gain years of experience in days, and to cover more ground by using his Shadow Clones as scouts.|$|E

2500|$|An {{outgoing}} Hawking radiated photon, if {{the mode}} is traced back in time, has a frequency which diverges from that {{which it has}} at great distance, as it gets closer to the horizon, which requires the wavelength of the photon to [...] "scrunch up" [...] infinitely at the horizon of the black hole. In a maximally extended external Schwarzschild solution, that photon's frequency stays regular only if the mode is extended back into the past region where no observer can go. That region seems to be unobservable and is physically suspect, so Hawking used a black hole solution without a past region which forms at a finite time in the past. In that case, {{the source of all}} the outgoing photons can be identified: a microscopic point right <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> the black hole first formed.|$|E
