500|$|A {{relatively}} negative review {{came from}} Chicago Sun-Times critic Lon Grahnke, who criticized Seinfeld's {{part in the}} episode: [...] "this comedy series must ride {{on the shoulders of}} its star. And Seinfeld spends too much time shrugging". He also noted Dreyfus was not granted screentime, as opposed to Richards, whose acting performances he described as [...] "get tiresome". Overall, Grahnke commented [...] "At his best, Seinfeld draws <b>a</b> <b>chuckle</b> or two from his middle-brow remarks on modern life and its perplexing contradictions. At his worst, the comedian shows the smugness of a detached star who can mechanically control the level of laughter that greets whatever quip he may utter." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, giving the episode a {{negative}} review, Nate Boss of Project:Blu {{wrote that the}} episode is [...] "Sometimes on point, sometimes dragging ass", and that it [...] "has the right idea", but [...] "just falls short". Ron Martin of 411Mania, who consider episodes about Lisa to be [...] "traditional channel changers", wrote that it [...] "offers {{one of the worst}} ‘Lisa episodes’" [...] of the series. Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide criticized the episode for being [...] "little more than a retread" [...] of earlier episodes of the series. He argued that the episode borrows plot elements from both [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian", [...] "Lisa's Pony" [...] and [...] "Grift of the Magi", and went on to write that the episode is [...] "a pretty unoriginal piece of work". He concluded his review by writing that the episode [...] "fails to deliver more than <b>a</b> <b>chuckle</b> or two".|$|E
500|$|The Wire {{published}} a favorable review by Joseph Stannard, {{in which he}} wrote [...] "If it is an elaborate put-on—and I suspect Ferraro isn't averse to <b>a</b> <b>chuckle</b> {{at the expense of}} his audience—Far Side Virtual still feels like the culmination of numerous releases' worth of research and development. ... Whether or not its creator is giggling through a bong smoke haze, Far Side Virtual is a convincing evocation of the digital dreamtime." [...] Stefan Wharton of Tiny Mix Tapes' took the album as a statement about blurred boundaries between consumers and their technologies, citing the writing of Markus Giesler as a precedent. Wharton said, [...] "Far Side Virtual succeeds in exciting the collective memory of that generation now so conjoined to its technological appendages." [...] In Pitchforks review, Soderberg wrote, [...] "the songs here are exactly the same as what they're ostensibly parodying, which is bold and maybe even the point. ... You suddenly realize you're listening to 45 minutes of utilitarian music that doesn't really have a purpose. Can something be utopian and dystopian at the same time? Probably. Maybe even always." ...|$|E

500|$|Shuffle! the anime {{television}} series received mixed reviews from critics. Theron Martin of Anime News Network described the anime as although [...] "genuinely enjoyable", often [...] "alternating between brazen stupidity, lame jokes, and disgusting sweetness" [...] criticizing {{it as being}} a typical harem anime that offered little new content. Helen Ellingwood of Active Anime disagreed stating that Shuffle! contained what she described {{as the most important}} ingredient, which sets it apart from other harem anime: [...] "heart". Anime News Network's Carlo Santos agreed with Martin's assessment, agreeing with the show's lack of novelty and stating that the highlight of the anime is its comedy, but that its romance is [...] "slowly running the series into the ground." [...] However, D. F. Smith of IGN stated that it actually does well against other harem anime as it [...] "may be ridiculous, exploitative, a simultaneous affront to good sense and good taste, but at least it's good for <b>a</b> <b>chuckle</b> or two". Smith criticized the ending for lacking [...] "intensity"; however, Ellingwood praised it for showing the consequences of avoiding which heroine the protagonist would choose to love, unlike harem anime she had prior.|$|E
500|$|Cinema Blend Amanda Krill said Stevens' wig {{looked like}} a [...] "Stepford Wives wig", adding: [...] "Everyone {{has a hard time}} not looking at it. She's still a cancer patient, but she knows that her job is on the line just like {{everyone}} else's. Everyone is working round the clock, showing up at every call, and the Chief is acting like a maniacal overlord." [...] Krill also enjoyed Oh's performance as Yang, writing: [...] "Cristina dealing with children is almost laughable – and actually provides <b>a</b> <b>chuckle</b> or two in this tense episode. Miss C thinks she is striking gold by moving to peds, because she {{will be able to do}} all types of surgery, and on little people, which makes the surgery harder, which is of course, better. Things don't turn out as planned, though, when she realizes kids are a little more resilient than their adult counterparts. And then Callie outs her to Arizona – in the she doesn’t really like kids sense of outing." [...] Krill enjoyed Wilson's performance as Bailey, in addition to Dane's, writing: [...] "He wins the best line of the show with 'That’s how I know my job is safe, Yang – I reattach babies arms.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Television {{critics have}} responded {{positively}} to the pairing. Robert Canning of IGN {{said of the}} episode [...] "Silly Love Songs": [...] "The absolute best part of [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] was Puckerman's unexpected longing for Lauren Zizes. Actress Ashley Fink has been fantastic in her small role, delivering great one-liners with ease. She was equally strong in this, the first episode to truly give Lauren a larger role and fill out her character more. Heck, {{it was nice to}} even see her smile a few times. The casting on Glee has either been very smart or very lucky since so many background characters have shined as they've been given bigger parts. The Lauren and Puck pairing came with a lot of laughs, but just as much heart. Puck singing Queen's [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls," [...] induced <b>a</b> <b>chuckle</b> at first, then some toe tapping. But it was Lauren's reaction that truly made the moment: 'That's the first song you've sung to me and it made me feel like crap.' I can't decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club commented: [...] "For me, the episode's highlight was the very sweet, funny courtship between Puck and Lauren. This may be because the writers have trouble writing for a self-professed bad boy, even though his escapades are straight out of Archie comics and not actually all that “bad” at all. But it’s always fun to watch Salling sing, and it’s always fun to watch him be smitten. Fink ends up being a good match for him, chemistry-wise, as she projects a confidence and certainty that makes it immediately obvious just what Puck sees in Lauren. The storyline also played out like both characters had something approaching real feelings." [...] In the following episode, VanDerWerff found her relationship with Puck [...] "a lot less assured" [...] than before, but Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez deemed their scenes [...] "as endearing as they are unrealistic", and E! Online's Jenna Mullins wrote that [...] "the ice around [...] heart melted just a bit when Puck mouthed Lauren that little bit of encouragement at the start of her solo." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{last known}} {{survivor}} of the accident, Peter Stoddart, was interviewed in Wisbech by Michael Simkins in around 1985. Simkins wrote in The Guardian in 2001: [...] "I asked him about a story I had heard of an officer who went about the scene shooting men trapped in the burning wreckage. 'That was true. I saw that. He was a Scottish gentleman, eventually a millionaire. But he had to.' There was a suspicion of <b>a</b> <b>chuckle</b> in his voice as he added: 'And there were one or two other survivors who made themselves scarce. They took their opportunity.'" [...] Peter Stoddart died on 4 July 1988 following a stroke.|$|E

[...] But {{he got out of}} the clutches of white thieves finally for fifty dollars instead of the three hundred which they had decided to mulct him of. He had sold a fat steer and had to wait the month to get his check and that delay he was ‘sorry’ for. [...] Had the Indian collected a drove of ponies from a white man’s ranch and tied them in a livery 20 miles away, and tried the same kind of ruse on the owner, do we guess that he would escape with <b>a</b> <b>chuckle,</b> as these whites did? [...] No indeed, the law would make good the white man’s claims against the Indian, sure and to the limit, but laws were made by the white man for the white man! ...|$|E
2500|$|Because of Fitzpatrick's {{desire for}} the {{photograph}} to reflect something of himself, he raised Che's eyes more and added his initial, a reversed [...] "F" [...] on the shoulder. It {{was not until the}} 40th anniversary of Che's death that Fitzpatrick admitted to this fact stating [...] "I’m a bit mischievous, so I never told anyone." [...] At this time Fitzpatrick said that [...] "I love the picture and wherever I am in the world, if I see it, I take a photo of it. I always have <b>a</b> <b>chuckle</b> when I see that little 'F'. I know that it's mine." [...] In November 2008, Fitzpatrick announced that he would be signing over the copyright of his Che image to the William Soler Pediatric Cardiology Hospital in Havana, Cuba. In announcing his reason for ensuring all future proceeds would go to the children's hospital, Fitzpatrick stated that [...] "Cuba trains doctors and then sends them around the world … I want their medical system to benefit." [...] Additionally, Fitzpatrick publicized his desire to gift the original artwork to the archive run by Guevara's widow, Aleida March.|$|E

2500|$|On February 11, 1970 Cavett {{hosted a}} tribute to the life and works of Sir Noël Coward, who had just been knighted in December 1969. Along with Coward, the other guests were Alfred Lunt, Lynn Fontanne, [...] and Tammy Grimes, and Brian Bedford (who were enjoying a {{successful}} run on Broadway in the revival of Coward's play Private Lives). In reviewing the show for The New York Times, television critic Jack Gould said [...] "The age of youth? Balder dash! The over‐70 set walked off yesterday morning with a television program that combined the engaging qualities of lightly recalled nostalgia, the sophisticated stiletto, and a demonstration of genuine affection that had more substance than adolescent wails on how love will save the world. Sir Noel Coward, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, friends of a lifetime, met on Dick Cavett's show on the American Broadcasting Company network. They exchanged quips, pleasantries and thoughts about the theater with the beguiling charm of talented luminaries. Mr. Cavett was clearly overawed, and for once, the ad libs frequently went over his head. It was an enchanting show…and the badinage was warm and delightful...a fun night, and to take out of context a line or here or there could not convey the whole. To go to bed with <b>a</b> <b>chuckle</b> provided by gifted and nice people, onstage as off, is review enough." [...] (Jack Gould, The New York Times, February 12, 1970, p.59) ...|$|E
