5|$|The AFM {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} Pentecostal {{movement}} is South Africa with roots in the Azusa Street Revival, the Holiness Movement teachings of Andrew Murray and the teachings of John Alexander Dowie. The AFM had <b>an</b> <b>interracial</b> character when it started, but, as in American Pentecostalism, this interracial cooperation was short-lived. The decades from the 1950s to the 1980s were marked by the implementation of apartheid. After 1994, the white AFM moved rapidly towards unification with the black churches. By 1996, all the AFM churches were united in a single multi-racial church.|$|E

40|$|This article details how Jews and Mexicans in Denver, Colorado came {{together}} in 1949 {{in the wake of}} <b>a</b> widely publicized <b>interracial</b> gang battle at one of the city 2 ̆ 7 s local middle schools. It documents the response of the local chapter of the Anti-Defamation League and its involvement in <b>a</b> <b>interracial</b> neighborhood council and how Jewish racial identity in Denver was informed by the broader racial geography of the West-a racial geography that was too often shaped by contrast with Mexicans. The article also challenges the notion that Denver was relatively free of anti-Semitism. Indeed, the 1905 lynching of Jacob Wesskind suggests a more nuanced story than the received wisdom about Jews being 2 ̆ 2 at home 2 ̆ 2 in Denver.

50|$|Many former Spanish slaves used Anglo-Spanish war as {{a chance}} to free {{themselves}} and fled into the mountainous and forested regions of the colony to join the ranks of surviving Tainos. <b>As</b> <b>interracial</b> marriage became extremely prevalent, the two racial groups underwent assimilation. The escaped slaves and their descendants, known as the Jamaican Maroons, were the source of many disturbances in the colony, raiding plantations and occupying parts of the island's interior. Imported African slaves would frequently escape to Maroon territory, known as Cockpit Country. Over the first seventy-six years of British rule, skirmishes between Maroon warriors and the British Army grew increasingly common, along with rebellions by enslaved Blacks.|$|R
