50|$|The grand inauguration {{took place}} 1 May 1900, {{and from the}} very {{beginning}} the palace was the site of different kinds of shows in addition to the intended art exhibitions. These included a riding competition that took place annually from 1901 to 1957, but were mainly dedicated to innovation and modernity: the automobile, aviation, household appliances, and so on. The golden age of the art exhibitions as such lasted for some thirty years, while the last took place in 1947. The first major Henri Matisse retrospective after his death was held at the Grand Palais. The structure had problems that started even before it was completed, mainly as a result of subsidence caused by a drop in the water table. The builders attempted to compensate for this subsidence, and for a tendency of the ground to shift, by sinking supporting posts down to firmer soil, since construction could not be delayed. These measures were only partially successful. Further damage occurred once the building was in use. Excessive force applied to structural members during the installation of certain exhibitions such as the Exposition Internationale de la Locomotion Aérienne caused damage, as did <b>acid</b> <b>runoff</b> from the horse shows.Additional problems due to the construction of the building itself revealed themselves over the course of time. Differential rates of expansion and contraction between cast iron and steel members, for example, allowed for water to enter, leading to corrosion and further weakening. When finally one of the glass ceiling panels fell in 1993, the main space had to be closed for restoration work, and was not fully reopened to the public until 2007.|$|E

All four commercial farms in the Animas River Valley were contacted and three responded for an interview. Along with these interviews, Darrin Parmenter La Plata County's Colorado State University extension director for agriculture was also interviewed. Farmers were asked questions regarding flood mitigation, soil contamination, and historical events that could have contaminated their fields. Their responses varied. Two farmers were unconcerned about the threats of flooding and the possibility of soil contamination through irrigation.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reviews the}} {{environmental}} {{factors that influence}} biodiversity of freshwater mollusc communities and conservation status of watercourses in two Mediterranean acid mine drainage-impacted basins of the southern Iberian Peninsula. We found 17 mollusc species: 14 gastropods (10 native and 4 introduced) and 3 bivalves. We found five distribution patterns: native headwater (Arganiella wolfi, Stagnicola palustris, Unio delphinus, Pisidium casertanum and Pisidium personatum) and mouth (Hydrobia acuta, Peringia ulvae and Myosotella myosotis) sensitive-stenochoric species, intermediate sensitive-widely distributed species (Planorbarius metidjensis and Radix balthica), insensitive-eurychoric species (Ancylus fluviatilis), and erratic-distribution pattern species (Galba truncatula and Planorbis carinatus). The highest biodiversity indices {{have been found in}} non-impacted headwaters and, to a lesser extent, in tidal streams. The biodiversity of the middle reaches, with varying degrees of impact by acid mine drainage and high water deficit, was scarce and dominated by introduced species. Over 30 % of the variation in native and introduced species richness is explained by environmental gradients related to heterogeneity (instream macrophytes cover and Fhi and Qbr indices) and <b>acid</b> <b>runoffs</b> (pH, conductivity, turbidity and concentration of sulphides). Severely impacted sites have no mollusc species. The conservation status of watercourses is also very remarkably influenced by the heterogeneity and contamination of the environment.

40|$|The test-mineral {{technique}} is widely employed in field {{as a means}} of assessing the chemical soil processes. Na-saturated vermiculite was used as a reference mineral and placed in ion-permeable polyamide bags that were buried in clayey acid sulfate soils belonging to three main environments of Lower Casamance (Senegal) : (i) highly saline soil, daily waterlogged by concentrated seawater (Koubalan site, Kb), (ii) weakly saline soil, seasonally flooded by severely <b>acid</b> <b>runoff</b> water stored in a small reservoir (Djiguinoum site, Dj); (iii) weakly saline soil, seasonally flooded by acid ground water uptake (Katoure site, Ka). Bags were recovered from each soil after one year and analyzed for exchangeable cations, cation-exchange capacity (CEC), extractable Al and Fe, and X-ray diffractiometry (XRD) before and after treatments with KCl, Na citrate, ammonium oxalate and dithionite-citrate reagents. In Dj soil, exchangeable Na on the vermiculite was mainly replaced with Al and CEC approximately decreased by 90 %. Large amounts of free Al were extracted by Na citrate reagent leading to the formation of an hydroxylated interlayer Al which was confirmed by XRD analysis. In Ko soil vermiculite was weakly affected, Ca having partly replaced Na. Vermiculite from Kt soil lost 25 % of its CEC, exchangeable Na being displaced by Ca. The vermiculite proved to be an excellent indicator of the chemical environment of acid sulfate soils, giving new arguments for modelling the formation of Al and Fe rich sulfates in dry conditions.

40|$|Dissolved {{aluminium}} concentrations ([Al]) in the < 0. 45 μm filtered fraction {{are described}} for 54 UK river sites covering rural, acidic/acid sensitive, agricultural and urban typologies, and wide pH range (4 to 11). High [Al] occurred under acidic conditions and for <b>acid</b> <b>runoff</b> neutralised by bicarbonate rich groundwater. Thermodynamic analysis indicates Al hydroxide/hydroxy-silicate oversaturation at circumneutral pH across the rivers, but undersaturation at lower/higher pH. The oversaturation reflects {{in part the}} presence of Al bearing colloids as indicated by (1) [Al] being correlated with components associated with both lithogenic (Fe, Ti and lanthanides) colloids and organic carbon, (2) baseflow studies using cross-flow ultrafiltration and (3) comparison of our data with Acid Waters Monitoring Network (AWMN) information on labile and non-labile Al. Tree harvesting and emission reductions of SOx in acidic and acid sensitive catchments in mid-Wales led to acidification reversal, lower [Al] and changing [H+] – [Al] relationships. The [Al] decline was confined to acidic conditions while [Al] increased during the later part of the monitoring period with a peak around 2002 for moorland and forested systems. Colloidal production across the flow range was indicated late in the record by comparison of our data with information collected by the AWMN for a site in mid-Wales. This production seems interlinked with organic carbon and with dissolved CO 2 changes. In order for further understanding of Al hydrogeochemistry in river systems {{there is a need}} to integrate research that moves from equilibrium to kinetic and colloidal consideration including the critical issues of organic and inorganic controls within the context of bioavailability and aquatic stress. The colloidal Al may well be of low environmental concern to fish and other factors such as habitat may well be critical. ...|$|E

40|$|Storm runoff in {{afforested}} catchments at LlynBrianne is acidic and Al-bearing. At baseflows, stream {{water is}} well-buffered with low Al levels. This paper {{presents the results}} of a study into how hydrologicalpathways account for these variations in stream-water chemistry. The investigation was carried out in the LI 1 catchment; a 0 · 4 -ha subcatchment covered by stagnohumic gley soils was monitored between October 1988 and September 1989. An instrumented hill-slope was established to identify the hydrologicalpathways that control the hydrochemistry of storm runoff draining from the subcatchment. Perched watertables developed in the surface horizons of the soil during storm episodes and produced lateral flow above the impeding subsoil. This near-surface flow path was responsible for generating <b>acid,</b> Al-rich storm <b>runoff.</b> Some water drained vertically through the soil profile into the underlying slope drift; seepage from groundwater in the drift sustained baseflows. Buffering reactions in the groundwater zone reduced the acidity and Al levels of baseflows. These hydrochemical characteristics are likely to be representative of other areas of stagnohumic gley soils, which cover 19 % of the LI 1 catchment: these soils may therefore provide a substantial source of <b>acid,</b> Al-bearing storm <b>runoff</b> in LI 1 and similar afforested catchment...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Mediterranean Sea is a semi-enclosed marine {{environment}} surrounded by densely populated areas. This ecosystem is under strong anthropogenic pressure at present. Riverine waters are important input pathways of water-soluble organic compounds that potentially {{contribute to the}} dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool. Here, we report the first ever measurements of bi-functional carboxylic acids such as α, ω -dicarboxylic acids (or diacids) and related polar compounds ω -oxoacids (or ketoacids) (BCAs = α, ω-dicarboxylic acids + ω -oxoacids), along with the DOC levels in Rhone River waters. Surface water samples were collected from February 2006 to June 2009 approximately 50 km above the Rhone River mouth, which is the main supplier of freshwater to the Mediterranean Sea. The BCA concentrations averaged 32. 4 ± 15. 3 µg l− 1, and exhibited {{a wide range of}} values from 13. 2 µg l− 1 (Spring 2008) to 71. 2 µg l− 1 (winter 2007). The contribution of carbon from BCAs to the DOC pool (BCA-C) accounted for 0. 28 to 1. 42 % of the DOC. Although no seasonal trend was evident in the studied period, our results showed that the highest BCA concentrations did not always follow high water discharges. α,ω -dicarboxylic acids are the most abundant compound class (20. 7 ± 10. 6 µg l− 1), which is followed by ω -oxoacids (11. 7 ± 6. 2 µg l− 1). The Rhone River was estimated to deliver between 1. 37 and 16. 4 t d− 1 of BCA to the Gulf of Lions. Assuming a mean water discharge of ∼ 1790 m 3 s− 1, a broad estimate suggests a loading of 750 – 4000 t yr− 1 BCAs to the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Our results indicated that glyoxylic acid (ωC 2) was the most abundant BCA followed by oxalic acid (C 2 di) and fumaric acid (trans configuration of unsaturated C 4 diacid). This result indicates that there is a different molecular distribution between the aquatic and atmospheric compartments, including rainwaters and aerosols, for which previous studies highlighted a predominance of oxalic acid, which was followed by malonic and/or succinic <b>acid.</b> <b>Runoff</b> and riverine biological process (rather than photochemical oxidation reactions) are hypothesized to control the BCA occurrence and molecular distribution in the Rhone River and thus their inputs to the coastal NW Mediterranean Sea, although the environmental implications of this stock of BCA are still unknown.

Concomitant increases in tapwater aluminum and decreases in tapwater pH were also observed at two homes in the water distribution system. Lead concentrations in the tapwater of one home frequently exceeded recommended levels, although spatial and temporal variation in tapwater copper and lead concentrations was considerable. Since source water and reservoir water copper and lead concentrations were much lower, the increased copper and lead concentrations in tapwater were attributed to corrosion of household plumbing. Tapwater copper concentration correlated well with tapwater pH and tapwater temperature. Asbestos fibers were not detected in tapwater. The asbestos-cement pipe in the water distribution system was protected by a spontaneous metallic coating that inhibited fiber release from the pipe. Several simultaneous reactions were hypothesized to be {{taking place in the}} distribution system that involved corrosion of metallic components and coating of asbestos-cement pipe components in part with corrosion products and in part by cations of watershed origin.

50|$|Mining, mineral {{processing}} and smelting {{activities in the}} area have produced gold, silver, lead and zinc for more than 130 years. Wastes generated during the mining and ore processing activities contained metals such as arsenic and lead at levels posing a threat to {{human health and the}} environment.

40|$|This report details {{results from}} the November 2006 {{seagrass}} monitoring survey for the Port of Mourilyan conducted {{as part of the}} annual long term monitoring program as well as {{results from the}} post tropical Cyclone Larry survey conducted in May 2006. The monitoring program was developed following a baseline survey in December 1993 and examines selected representative seagrass meadows in Mourilyan Harbour. Total area of each monitoring meadow, species composition and seagrass density (above ground biomass) were measured for comparison with previous surveys. In 2006 seagrass meadows in Mourilyan Harbour remained in a fair condition despite the impacts of a severe category 5 cyclone in March. While declines had occurred for some meadows there had been evidence of recovery for most, with the densest intertidal meadow remaining largely unaffected and increases occurring for the major subtidal monitoring meadow. Despite this most intertidal meadows remained in a highly vulnerable state and were at their lowest area and biomass since the beginning of seagrass monitoring in 1993. The major drivers of seagrass change in Mourilyan Harbour appear to have been related to climate, flood and storm events. These events combined with the effects of local catchment use explain much of the seagrass change observed. The continued stress on these meadows and decline in meadow density left them in a far less resilient state in 2005 than had previously been the case. Many of these intertidal meadows suffered further major declines following tropical Cyclone Larry in March 2006, but most had begun to recover by November. While the recent changes to seagrass meadows at Mourilyan Harbour were most likely related to climatic conditions and the effects of cyclone Larry, human activities in the broader Moresby River catchment had the potential to exacerbate the effects of these natural events through agricultural and other disturbances resulting in high turbidity, nutrients, herbicides and <b>acid</b> sulphate <b>runoff.</b> The beginnings of post-cyclone recovery of seagrasses indicate that the marine environment in Mourilyan Harbour appeared to be relatively healthy although seagrass meadows still remained in a vulnerable state.

Comparable to other tropical areas worldwide, increasing urban and agricultural {{development in the}} Wet Tropics has caused concerns with respect to ecosystem degradation due to poor water quality in freshwater reaches and marine environments. Key issues currently identified in the Wet Tropics include erosion and subsequent stream turbidity and sedimentation, nutrients from erosion and fertiliser use and pesticide residue contamination.

A pilot-scale system was installed at an agricultural land site in Rintala embankment area in mid-western Finland. The experimental layout consists of three parallel treatment units: two different SAPS cells and one limestone-filled cell for comparison of performance. The SAPS cells are composed of a bottom layer of limestone and a top layer of compost supplemented with sand. One of the SAPS cells contains sulphate-rich, waste gypsum mixed with the compost layer {{in order to enhance}} the metal reduction by sulphate reducing-bacteria. Over a 3 year period on average between 612 l min- 1 of water from a nearby drain receiving acid drainage was directed to the system. The quality of the influent water was highly variable: pH 4. 17. 1, aluminium 0. 06129 mg l- 1, iron 0. 04622 mg l- 1, manganese 1. 923 mg l- 1. Flow through the cells increased the pH and decreased the acidity and concentrations of Al and Fe. Manganese concentrations did not change significantly (P < 0. 05, paired t-test) in any of the treatment cells. The current results do not demonstrate the advantages of a SAPS system when compared to a limestone bed and the present implementation is not considered to be an effective treatment method for acid drainage water. Therefore, to increase the alkalinity production of SAPS cells, the system will be modified to increase the contact time of water with limestone. ...|$|R

Evidence from the literature for other environments, suggests that determination of amino acid patterns of distribution may be a useful method for improved understanding of the interaction of microbial synthesis and degradation of organic N in conjunction with soil physical states. A sample pre-concentration technique and an HPLC methodology were developed that enabled the determination of dissolved free (DFAA) and combined (DCAA) amino acids in natural waters at picomolar concentration. These methods were {{used to examine the}} content of amino acids and their distribution patterns in waters from 3 different settings. Firstly, field-sized lysimeters (1 ha) were used to examine dissolved free and combined amino <b>acids</b> in surface <b>runoff</b> and drainage waters from a grassland soil over 3 winter drainage periods. The waters were collected from soils beneath drained and undrained permanent ryegrass swards, receiving 280 kg N haˉ¹yrˉ¹, permanent ryegrass receiving no mineral N input, and grass/white clover (no mineral N). Total DFAA concentration ranged between 1. 9 nM - 6. 1 µM and total DCAA concentration ranged between 1. 3 - 87 µM. A large library of amino acid distributions was assembled and multivariate pattern analysis techniques were used to determine whether there were distinctive amino acid signatures that {{could be used as a}} diagnostics for soil management and condition. Although addition of mineral N fertilizer increased amino acid concentration in waters, there was no detectable effect of fertilizer addition on DFAA distribution patterns. In contrast, both DFAA and DCAA patterns were strongly influenced by soil hydrology alone. However, in the case of DCAA patterns, there was evidence of an interaction between hydrology and fertilizer addition. Secondly, monolith lysimeters were used to determine the DFAA in drainage waters from 4 different grassland soil types, in order to find whether there was evidence of pattern difference with soil texture. Results showed that distribution patterns vary between soil types, and contrary to what might be expected, that clay soils do not necessarily retain basic amino acids. Thirdly, the concentration and patterns of DFAA were determined hourly over a 24 hour period, for a river that received exported soil waters from the field lysimeters mentioned above. Total DFAA concentration correlated with water temperature and NH 4 + Compared with exported soil waters, the concentrations of DFAA in river water were several orders of magnitude smaller, although GLY, SER, LYS and MET were in greater relative proportions. Results of the studies show that amino acids have the potential to be used as diagnostics of source, soil condition and management. BBSRC Institute of Grassland and Environmental Researc...|$|R
