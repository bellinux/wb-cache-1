50|$|C. K. Ingold with E. D. Hughes and G. Catchpole {{independently}} {{described a}} thermodynamic and kinetic reaction control model in 1948. They were reinvestigating a certain allylic rearrangement reported in 1930 by Jakob Meisenheimer. Solvolysis of gamma-phenylallyl chloride with AcOK in acetic acid {{was found to}} give a mixture of the gamma and the alpha acetate with the latter converting to the first by equilibration. This was interpreted as a case {{in the field of}} <b>anionotropy</b> of the phenomenon, familiar in prototropy, of the distinction between kinetic and thermodynamic control in ion-recombination.|$|E
