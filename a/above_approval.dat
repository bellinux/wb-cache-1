30|$|Ethics {{approval}} to conduct {{this study was}} granted by the Queensland University of Technology Human Research Ethics Committee (Approval Number 0900000345) and the NHMRC Registered Committee (Number EC 00171). A comprehensive National Ethics Application Form (NEAF) (now referred to as Human Research Ethics Application) was submitted and approved for this project and the <b>above</b> <b>approval</b> number allocated. The writing of the ethics and conduct of the research was informed by important sources pertaining to research with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, communities and schools and included The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies (AIATSIS 2012) which identified in the six overarching principles that “at every stage, research with and about Indigenous peoples must be founded on a process of meaningful engagement and reciprocity between the research and Indigenous peoples (p. 3).” Further the guiding principles of Kennedy and Cram (2010) which focus on self-determination, clear benefits, acknowledgement and awareness, cultural integrity and capacity building were drawn on together with the critical work of Smith (2012) based on reciprocity and empowerment of Indigenous Peoples.|$|E

40|$|POLICY Cases {{in which}} {{criminal}} activity {{is motivated by}} bigotry and intolerance for others are regarded as serious matters. Where Crown Counsel concludes, after consultation with Regional or Deputy Regional Crown Counsel, {{that there is a}} reasonable likelihood that the court will make a determination on sentencing that an offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation or any other similar factor, Crown Counsel should lead the evidence necessary to prove the motivation beyond a reasonable doubt and, if that evidence is admitted, take the position on sentencing that the motivation must be treated as an aggravating factor under section 718. 2 (a) (i) of the Criminal Code. In almost all cases where offences are motivated by bias, prejudice or hate as described above, the public interest factors outlined in the policy on Charge Assessment Guidelines – CHA 1 apply in favour of prosecution. Under the policy on Alternative Measures for Adult Offenders – ALT 1, for hate motivated or hate propaganda offences, Regional or Deputy Regional Crown Counsel must approve any referral of a person for alternative measures consideration and also the specific alternative measures recommended in any Alternative Measures Report. In all cases the <b>above</b> <b>approvals</b> should be given only if the following conditions are met: 1. Identifiable individual victims should be consulted and their wishes considered. 2. The offender should have no history of related offences or violence. 3. The offender should accept responsibility for the act or omission that forms the basis of the alleged offence...|$|R

50|$|As this voting {{method is}} {{cardinal}} rather than ordinal, {{it is possible}} to model voters {{in a way that does}} not simplify to an ordinal method. Modelling voters with a 'dichotomous cutoff' assumes a voter has an immovable approval cutoff, while having meaningful cardinal preferences. This means that rather than voting for their top 3 candidates, or all candidates <b>above</b> the average <b>approval</b> (which may result in their vote changing if one candidate drops out, resulting in a system that does not satisfy IIA), they instead vote for all candidates <b>above</b> a certain <b>approval</b> 'cutoff' that they have decided. This cutoff does not change, regardless of which and how many candidates are running, so when all available alternatives are either above or below the cutoff, the voter votes for all or none of the candidates, despite preferring some over others. While this extreme appears unrealistic, it actually reflects reality in the way that many voters become disenfranchised and apathetic if they see no candidates they approve of. In this way, there is evidence to suggest that many voters may have an internal cutoff, and would not simply vote for their top 3, or the above average candidates, although that is not to say that it is necessarily entirely immovable.|$|R

40|$|Data {{quality is}} one of the major {{concerns}} of using crowdsourcing websites such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to recruit participants for online behavioral studies. We compared two methods for ensuring data quality on MTurk: attention check questions (ACQs) and restricting participation to MTurk workers with high reputation (<b>above</b> 95 % <b>approval</b> ratings). In Experiment 1, we found that high-reputation workers rarely failed ACQs and provided higher-quality data than did low-reputation workers; ACQs improved data quality only for low-reputation workers, and only in some cases. Experiment 2 corroborated these findings and also showed that more productive high-reputation workers produce the highest-quality data. We concluded that sampling high-reputation workers can ensure high-quality data without having to resort to using ACQs, which may lead to selection bias if participants who fail ACQs are excluded post-hoc...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of multi-criteria {{evaluation}} of four management strategies for Fruška Gora National Park. The criteria set was defined in ac­cordance with the IUCN guidelines for management of national parks. Four strategies were evaluated by testing preference intensities for each alternative with the respect to each cri­terion. Alternatives with preference <b>above</b> the <b>approval</b> threshold were approved, and a multi-criteria approval matrix was generated. According to the matrix, the most suitable management strategy was identified. It implies an intense protection of natural resources and landscape diversity in the national park by applying bio-engineering measures. This illustrative example proved that multi-criteria approval can be considered as a good deci­sion support tool when {{there is no need for}} a deeper insight into cardinal values of criteria weights and alternatives, or if the decision maker has to select few from many of alterna­tives to reduce the decision problem. For a more precise analysis, it is recommended to combine multi-criteria approval with other decision support tools, and future studies might deal with this problem in order to define an alternative framework for decision making in landscape management.

How long must these wretched Monks go on doing their lazy thrice-deleterious torpid blasphemy; and a King, not histrionic but real, merely signify that he laughs at them and it?

40|$|A drug {{developed}} for human use classically {{goes through a}} number of steps, including discovery, extensive preclinical studies for safety in experimental animals, and then human safety and efficacy studies. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires successful completion of all the <b>above</b> tasks before <b>approval</b> for therapeutic use in human beings. The exciting advances in human genomics and combinatorial chemistry promise substantial applications to new drugs for human diseases; however, the time and expense associated with the processes necessary to bring a new drug to market are rising exponentially. Thus, there is a great need for functional models of disease progression, including animal models of human disease and biomarkers in human clinical trials. BIOMARKERS AND SURROGATE MARKERS The monitoring of biologic disease processes increasingly employs biomarkers (Table 34. 1). At a recent National Institutes of Health (NIH) and FDA conference (1) biomarkers for clinical efficacy were divided into several groups including natural history markers, biological activity markers, and surrogate markers. A relevant issue in clinical trials is the selection of an appropriate endpoint. Endpoints that are less deleterious than death or onset of a disease are desirable. Surrogate markers or endpoints are events of a more intermediate nature. These typically replace the final endpoints such as mortality. A surrogate marker is defined statistically as a ‘‘response variable for which a test of the null hypothesis of no relationship to the treatment groups under comparison is also a valid test of the corresponding null hypothesis base...|$|R
6000|$|In {{the first}} place in {{following}} out such an argument as the present {{in regard to the}} peculiar shortcomings of the system under which we live, it is necessary again and again to warn the reader against a hasty conclusion to the possibilities of altering and amending it. The socialist reads such criticism as the <b>above</b> with impatient <b>approval.</b> [...] "Very well," [...] he says, [...] "the whole organization is wrong and works badly. Now let us abolish it altogether and make a better one." [...] But in doing so he begs the whole question at issue. The point is, can we make a better one or must we be content with patching up the old one? Take an illustration. Scientists tell us that {{from the point of view}} of optics the human eye is a clumsy instrument poorly contrived for its work. A certain great authority once said that if he had made it he would have been ashamed of it. This may be true. But the eye unfortunately is all we have to see by. If we destroy our eyes in the hope of making better ones we may go blind. The best that we can do is to improve our sight by adding a pair of spectacles. So it is with the organization of society. Faulty though it is, it does the work after a certain fashion. We may apply to it with advantage the spectacles of social reform, but what the socialist offers us is total blindness. But of this presently.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} weights accorded decision factors in choices of dual versus regional accreditation made by directors of associate degree nursing programs in American colleges and universities. Administrators are pivotal in decisions to seek dual accreditation, i. e., accreditation by both regional associations and the National League of Nursing. Barely two-thirds of associate degree programs have dual accreditation {{although there is}} almost universal agreement that such accreditation enhances these programs immeasurably. Failure to seek dual accreditation by such {{a large number of}} programs is a cause for concern. ^ Directors of all associate degree nursing programs in the country (N = 840) were asked to complete a Likert-type questionnaire soliciting ratings of decision factors used in choosing to seek [...] or not to seek [...] dual accreditation. The influence of type and size of institution on responses was tested. ^ A total of 680 usable returns comprised the sample for the study. Rank ordered means and standard deviation, along with one-way analysis of variance and Scheffe a posteriori tests, comprised the principal statistical applications for the study. ^ Leading decision factors in failure to seek dual accreditation included belief that costs far outweigh the benefits of dual accreditation, failure of support on the part of central office administrators, and a firmly held belief that specialized accreditation, over and <b>above</b> regional association <b>approval,</b> is simply not necessary. These findings were pronounced among small private colleges. ^ The data suggest that the National League for Nursing must focus more on benefits accruing to graduates of dual accredited programs. Research needs to be completed to identify these benefits and the results must be made clear to directors of programs without dual accreditation and to administrators of schools housing these programs. ...|$|R
