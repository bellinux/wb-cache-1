At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 71, based on 13 reviews. Matthew Chisling from Allmusic called the album [...] "a well-crafted sampling of feisty <b>anti-pop</b> in high quality", and wrote that it [...] "fails {{to come up}} short on funky sounds to amuse fans of this dance genre." [...] Nicole Powers of URB complimented its [...] "irony-laden lyrics, delivered in a style that owes {{a little something to}} Gwen Stefani," [...] as well as the album's [...] "deluxe ditties". Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "remarkably (and exhaustingly) pure in its vision of a world in which nothing trumps being beautiful, dirty, and rich. In this economy, though, her high-times escapism has its charms". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian found it [...] "packing an immensely addictive melody or an inescapable hook, virtually everything sounds like another hit single", and predicted that it [...] "certainly sounds like it could be big." [...] Daniel Brockman from The Phoenix wrote that [...] "Gaga ups the ante in terms of catchy songwriting and sheer high-in-the-club-banging-to-the-beat abandon." [...] Ben Hogwood of musicOMH praised Gaga's [...] "blend of sassy attitude, metallic beats and sharp, incisive songwriting", elements which he felt are integral to [...] "creating pop music".|$|E

In addition, McCartney's vocal performance is noticeably different in both versions: in the film version, it sounds rough in certain moments since he is not using <b>anti-pop</b> on his mic; there are also a couple of falsetto vocals performed by him (extending the vocal 'e' on the word 'be'), for instance in the 'let it be' line that precedes the second chorus.

It stops at the point where Rigby is about to crash into the wall, and he recalls the events happening. Rigby tries to {{convince}} Mordecai, but he doesn't remember. Rigby then goes to where they previously buried their memories, Mordecai touches it and remembers everything. Realizing that time didn't reset, they use [...] "The Power" [...] to take them to the fight in the future. Pops and <b>Anti-Pops</b> are still fighting and Mordecai and Rigby appear, which leaves Pops surprised. <b>Anti-Pops</b> blasts them, destroying the Power in the process. When it becomes a stalemate again, Pops realizes what he must do to stop the reboot of time. He does this by sacrificing himself and <b>Anti-Pops</b> into the sun. After this, time continues and we see the future lives of the park gang as they return to Earth. After when Mr. Maellard depressed and mourning for his son, the park workers erect a memorial for Pops, Mordecai and Rigby quit their jobs at the park and move on with their lives. Mordecai finally makes his dream of being a painter come true and meets a woman named Stef female bat he genuinely loves (and though he never reconnects with either Margaret or CJ, he does consider them his muses and incorporates their appearances in his art). Rigby settles down with Eileen and becomes a father. Muscle Man reunites with his wife, Starla, and the two move to a nicer trailer and continue to have children. High-Five Ghost and his girlfriend, Celia, become party DJs touring in Prague. Benson, who now becomes park owner after Mr. Maellard dies, gets together with Pam the scientist and the two raise four cats and Applesauce, Benson's pig.
