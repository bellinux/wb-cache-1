5|$|In July 2012, a Lebanese man was {{detained}} by Cyprus police on possible charges relating to terrorism laws for planning attacks against Israeli tourists. According to security officials, {{the man was}} planning attacks for Hezbollah in Cyprus and admitted this after questioning. The police were alerted <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> due to an urgent message from Israeli intelligence. The Lebanese man was in possession of photographs of Israeli targets and had information on Israeli airlines flying {{back and forth from}} Cyprus, and planned to blow up a plane or tour bus. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Iran assisted the Lebanese man with planning the attacks.|$|E
5|$|As part of William III and Mary II's {{coronation}} honours, Churchill {{was created}} Earl of Marlborough on 9 April 1689 (O.S.); {{he was also}} sworn {{as a member of}} the Privy Council and made a Gentleman of the King's Bedchamber. His elevation, however, led to accusatory rumours from King James's supporters that Marlborough had disgracefully betrayed his erstwhile king for personal gain; William himself entertained reservations <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who had deserted James. Marlborough's apologists though, including his most notable descendant and biographer Winston Churchill, have been at pains to attribute patriotic, religious, and moral motives to his action; but in the words of Chandler, it is difficult to absolve Marlborough of ruthlessness, ingratitude, intrigue and treachery against a man to whom he owed virtually everything in his life and career to date.|$|E

When Ruksar, Radhika and Govind all meet, the three realise what happened and brokenheartedly part ways.|$|E

500|$|The {{species was}} {{named by the}} Unitarian {{minister}} John Lewis Russell of Salem, Massachusetts, based on specimens found in Brattleboro, Vermont. He named the fungus after his friend, fellow amateur American mycologist Charles Christopher Frost, who published {{a description of the}} species in his 1874 survey of the boletes of New England. When the name of a species is contributed by an individual, but the name is formally published by another, the contributor's name can be cited, separated from the publishing author as apud; for this reason, the name and authority are written Boletus Frostii Russell apud Frost in some older literature. Bernard Ogilvie Dodge made reference to B.frostii in 1950 during an address to the Mycological Society of America, in which he spoke {{about the role of the}} amateur in discovering new species: [...] "They would have informed us all <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> Russell, who named a fine new bolete for his friend Frost, and <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> Frost, who named a fine new bolete for his friend Russell. Boletus Frostii and Boletus Russellii are mushrooms with character, even though they were described by amateurs." [...] However, in attempting to establish a lectotype specimen, mycologist Roy Halling examined both Russell's original material and his accompanying notes; he concluded that it was Frost who made the original species determinations, further suggesting that [...] "there is no evidence to show that Russell ever collected B.frostii or wrote a description of it." ...|$|E

[...] Todd McCarthy from Variety called Ed Wood [...] "a fanciful, sweet-tempered biopic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> often described as the worst film director of all time. Always engaging to watch and often dazzling in its imagination and technique, picture is also a bit distended, and lacking in weight at its center.

According to historian Terry McLean: [...] "In a long experience of reading and hearing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>man,</b> one has never encountered, from the New Zealand angle, or from his fellow players, criticism of his qualities as a leader." [...] In the view of the English rugby journalist E. H. D.

I never heard a soul who met him on that famous trip, say a disparaging word about him." ...|$|E

[...] To me, who was justly entitled to the Republican nomination for the presidency, and who had to stand aside and see it given to a little Illinois lawyer!" [...] Despite his initial reservations about Lincoln's abilities, he came to admire Lincoln as the president grew more confident in his job. [...] Seward wrote to his wife in June 1861, [...] "Executive skill and vigor are rare qualities. The President {{is the best of}} us, but he needs constant and assiduous cooperation." [...] According to Goodwin, [...] "Seward would become his most faithful ally in the cabinet... Seward's mortification at not having received his party's nomination never fully abated, but he no longer felt compelled to belittle Lincoln to ease his pain." [...] Lincoln, a one-term congressman, was inexperienced in Washington ways, and relied on Seward's advice on protocol and social etiquette.|$|E

Mulder decides to exhume the Lynette's body and take away her father's power, but when they exhume the casket there is no body inside.|$|E
