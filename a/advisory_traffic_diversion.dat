40|$|Traditionally, {{distance}} {{was considered the}} parameter that could better reflect the economic influence of a seaport on land. Containerisation and intermodality progressively eroded such a paradigm and currently distance became {{only one of the}} factors across the overall "equation". In this respect, a fundamental role is played by the effectiveness of inland connections. The better the connection of a port to the various inland markets, the bigger the potential to enlarge its overall captive area. Furthermore, the higher the "frictions" (bottlenecks, delays, etc.) for reaching the hinterland, the lower the inland traffic flows. The major purpose of the paper is to measure container <b>traffic</b> <b>diversion</b> from Ligurian ports (Genoa, La Spezia and Savona) to the main Italian and European competitors. The application of a gravity model will reveal the current role of distance in drawing hinterland market share among the selected ports. Moreover, for evaluating the unexploited potentialities of Ligurian ports, we compared real traffic flows with the outcomes of a spatial interaction model, reassigning inland container flows to the different sampled ports. The calculation of the traffic delta through a gap analysis, allowed measuring the "frictions" thwarting the connectivity between the Ligurian ports and the sampled hinterland regions. Finally, the paper discusses the nature and the reasons for the above <b>traffic</b> <b>diversion.</b> Container port hinterland Competitiveness Spatial interaction Gravity model <b>Traffic</b> <b>diversion...</b>|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{most of the}} {{incident}} management (IM) teams depend on paper maps and information sheets when <b>traffic</b> <b>diversion</b> is warranted {{in the presence of}} a major accident. These paper maps are not only difficult to use {{in the presence of a}}n emergency situation, they are also difficult to maintain to ensure up-to-date information. A customized computer based system that takes advantage of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) is the best solution for accessing and maintaining these diversion maps and related other information.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to provide a geographical analysis of Canadian container flows and an assessment of the concept of trade diversion {{in the context of the}} North American free trade zone. Data are drawn from a commercial source that allow the competitive structure of the flows to be determined. The geographical dynamics of the traffic are examined from the perspective of the international maritime foreland and the terrestrial hinterland in North America. The intensity of flows between overseas regions and provincial markets are investigated in detail to assess the scope of traffic capture of Canadian containers by the intermodal transport systems of the United States. The research dissects the trend towards massification and specialisation by analysing the opinions of the principal actors in the trade on both East and West Coasts. The persistence of public authorities in the management of national transport systems perpetuates the concept of <b>traffic</b> <b>diversion</b> despite the transnational integration of intermodal networks.

40|$|Throughout the United States {{metropolitan}} area freeways are operating {{at or near}} capacity. Any disturbance in the traffic flow on these freeways, planned or unplanned, can result in varying degrees of congestion. Incident management programs have been established in urban areas nationwide to help reduce the magnitude of incident induced congestion. These programs focus mainly on the incident identification and response stage, and have only recently begun to develop the tools and techniques needed to manage the recovery stage. One technique that has been becoming more widely employed, with the increased focus incident management and overall traffic systems management, is alternate route <b>traffic</b> <b>diversion.</b> However, even when diversion strategies are employed, often only the main line freeway is evaluated and insufficient consideration {{is given to the}} effect of the diversion on the alternate route. Also, <b>traffic</b> <b>diversion</b> strategies are typically deployed only during extreme incidents and are seldom deployed or even analyzed for how they would help mitigate congestion related to minor traffic incidents. If delay on the freeway network as a whole is to be minimized, incident management programs need to incorporate comprehensive traffic management strategies and decision aids for the defining of <b>traffic</b> <b>diversion</b> strategies. This study utilized Federal Highway Administration 2 ̆ 7 s (FHWA) traffic microsimulation software, CORSIM, to evaluate a freeway route diversion strategy that would increase traveler safety and alleviate congestion caused by minor incidents. The goal of the project was to reduce the impacts of minor incidents on a freeway system {{through the use of a}} methodically analyzed diversion strategy. The four specific objectives of the research were (1) to determine the impact of varying degrees of <b>traffic</b> <b>diversion</b> will have on the network evaluators for varying levels of traffic volumes encountering different incident situations; (2) to evaluate CORSIM and companion software as tools for performing this analysis; (3) to determine and document the procedure of the use of CORSIM in this facility; and (4) to recommend a diversion practice. The research analysis used typical measures of effectiveness to evaluate the effects of minor incidents and <b>traffic</b> <b>diversion</b> on a mainline and alternate route. The results of the research show that CORSIM is a valuable tool for researchers, planners, or transportation engineers performing diversion strategy analysis. By utilizing CORSIM to simulate specific route diversion strategies valuable insights were gained into the effects that minor unplanned traffic incidents and deployed route diversion strategies will have on average network measures of effectiveness. It was found that the traffic condition the network is experiencing at the time of a minor incident and route diversion has distinct impacts on the network evaluators. CORSIM simulations demonstrated that the four levels of traffic condition tested produce distinct route diversion strategy recommendations. It was shown that the diversion modeled had a negative impact under AM peak traffic conditions, a slightly positive impact under 3 / 4 AM peak traffic conditions, significantly positive impact under 2 / 3 AM peak traffic conditions, and no impact under 1 / 2 AM peak traffic conditions. The significance of these results is that they indicate that it is only beneficial to the entire network to divert traffic for certain incident situations when the network is operating at 3 / 4 AM peak or 2 / 3 AM peak traffic. At AM peak and 1 / 2 AM peak <b>traffic</b> condition, <b>diversion</b> was not found to be warranted for any of the minor incident situations modeled...|$|R

40|$|This study {{develops}} a comprehensive guideline {{to estimate the}} <b>traffic</b> <b>diversion</b> rates and capacity reduction for work zones. The analysis of the <b>traffic</b> <b>diversion</b> patterns with data from past work zones in the metro freeway network in Minnesota resulted {{in a set of}} the diversion-estimation models that relate the diversion rates at freeway ramps with the travel times and speed levels on a freeway and alternative routes during construction. The interrelationship between <b>diversion</b> and work-zone <b>traffic</b> conditions has {{led to the development of}} an iterative process, where a freeway simulation model interacts with the diversion-estimation models until a convergence is achieved between diversion and resulting freeway delays. Freeval is adopted in this study as the simulation tool for freeways. The test results of the iterative process with the work zone data showed promising results in determining both the diversion rates and freeway delay for a given work-zone. Due to the types of the work zones used in developing the diversion models, the iterative process developed in this study can be applicable to only "two-to-one" lane reduction cases in estimating the diversion rates for the mainline exit flows, while the diversion rates at entrance ramps can be determined without such restrictions. The capacity analysis of the lane-closure sections performed in this study has also resulted in a set of the suggested capacity values for the work zones with two-to- one lane reduction...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the conditions for}} which ramp metering can be beneficial to the overall system in terms of travel time savings for a simple traffic corridor that consists of a freeway {{and a set of}} parallel arterials connected by entrance ramps. The focus is on analyzing state and control relationships to arrive at general analytical results regarding optimal metering policies, rather than on either developing specific control algorithms or solving a specific application. The analysis is concerned with the general behavior of the system under ramp control and <b>traffic</b> <b>diversion.</b> The analysis assumes that time-varying traffic demands that originate from various locations are destined for a single location and that the freeway is uniformly congested throughout the control period. Under these assumptions, some general results are obtained regarding the effectiveness of ramp metering for various <b>traffic</b> <b>diversion</b> propensities and differentials between freeway and arterial traffic conditions. It is shown that the optimal ramp control policies are determined by the magnitudes of two co-state vectors that depend on traffic conditions on the freeway and its alternative, and the drivers diversion propensity. The results of two limiting cases imply that when the freeway is uniformly congested ramp control is counter-productive unless diversion occurs, and where drivers have a high propensity to divert, the optimal policy is dependent on the travel speed on the freeway alternative and on the wave speed of backward propagating waves on the freeway. ...|$|R
