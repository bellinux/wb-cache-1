25|$|In LiDCO, the {{independent}} calibration technique is lithium chloride dilution using the Stewart-Hamilton principle. Lithium chloride dilution uses a peripheral vein and a peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>line.</b> Like PiCCO, frequent calibration is recommended {{when there is}} a change in Q. Calibration events are limited in frequency because they involve the injection of lithium chloride and can be subject to errors in the presence of certain muscle relaxants. The PulseCO algorithm used by LiDCO is based on pulse power derivation and is not dependent on waveform morphology.|$|E

25|$|UD {{requires}} {{the establishment of}} an extracorporeal circulation through its unique AV loop with two pre-existing arterial and central venous lines in ICU patients. When the saline indicator is injected into the AV loop, it is detected by the venous clamp-on sensor on the loop before it enters the patient’s heart's right atrium. After the indicator traverses the heart and lung, the concentration curve in the <b>arterial</b> <b>line</b> is recorded and displayed on the COstatus HCM101 Monitor. Cardiac output is calculated from the area of the concentration curve using the Stewart-Hamilton equation. UD is a non-invasive procedure, requiring only a connection to the AV loop and two lines from a patient. UD has been specialised for application in pediatric ICU patients and has been demonstrated to be relatively safe although invasive and reproducible.|$|E

This study evaluates the accuracy of aPTT results drawn from the Lab-Site pressure tubing system which provides a closed system that eliminates blood discard. Blood was obtained from radial artery catheters connected to the Lab-Site system and compared to specimens obtained simultaneously, by venipuncture. The paired t-test indicated no significant difference between the arterial and venous samples. The Pearson product moment correlation of 0. 619 indicated good correlation between arterial and venous values.

DESCRIPTION: Chest drains, central venous catheters, umbilical catheters, <b>arterial</b> <b>lines,</b> endotracheal and nasogastric tubes may all be used in paediatric patients under {{a wide range of}} common elective and emergency circumstances. The devices can vary from those inserted in adult patients due to patient size, tolerance and anatomical differences. Different sites of access may also be used for central venous catheters and <b>arterial</b> <b>lines.</b> As such, the potential complications following insertion of these devices, and the radiographic appearances of the devices and their complications can differ substantially from their adult equivalents. We will review the radiographic appearances of these complications in different imaging modalities, but with particular emphasis on plain radiography, which is the most common modality used to review the position of these devices post-insertion. CONCLUSION: The radiographic appearances of complications following the insertion of lines, tubes, catheters and drains in the paediatric patient can differ substantially from those seen in adult patient populations. This review of these appearances may facilitate early recognition of such complications and thus aims to be of educational benefit to all those involved in the care of paediatric patients...|$|R
