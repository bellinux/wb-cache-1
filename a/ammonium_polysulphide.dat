40|$|Reclamation of four salt-affected soils {{collected}} from southern Arizona was {{studied in the}} greenhouse and laboratory. Two rates of four amendments (sulphuric acid, gypsum, <b>ammonium</b> <b>polysulphide,</b> and ammonium thiosulphate) were applied in triplicate. Results were evaluated in terms of changes in nutrient availability, ions removed by leaching, plant growth, and infiltration rates. In most cases the high rates of sulphuric acid and gypsum increased the solubility of the major cations (Na, K, Ca, and Mg) in the soil. If the required amount of leaching water were applied to the soil, {{a significant amount of}} these cations, especially Na, was leached from the soil. For the Gothard soil (saline-sodic) two pore volumes were sufficient to accomplish leaching, but were insuffcient for the Guest (nonsaline-slightly sodic) and Gilman (highly saline-sodic) soils. High rates of sulphuric acid and gypsum decreased the pH and increased the EC for all soils, although the EC was not significant at the 5 % level for the Mohall (nonsaline-nonsodic, calcareous) soil. All treatments decreased the pH of the Gothard soil significantly; however, the greatest increase in EC and least pH were obtained from acid application. Regarding changes in phosphorus (P), all treatments increased the amount of soluble P in the leachates from the Gothard and Guest soils; whereas available soil P increased significantly only with the acid treatments. None of the treatments affected the amount of P in the Gilman soil leachates, but acid and gypsum increased the available soil P. <b>Ammonium</b> <b>polysulphide</b> and ammonium thiosulphate tended to increase available P but the increase was not significant at the 5 % level. None of the treatments affected the P parameters for the Mohall soil. Sulphuric acid increased growth and P uptake of alfalfa plants on all soils except the Mohall. Gypsum and <b>ammonium</b> <b>polysulphide</b> increased P uptake on the Gothard and Guest soils whereas ammonium thiosulphate increased P uptake only for the Guest soil. Sulphuric acid and gypsum increased the infiltration rates for all four soils. Thiosulphate produced intermediate infiltration rates while the lowest rates were found with <b>ammonium</b> <b>polysulphide</b> and the untreated soils. Although amendment rates were based on equivalent amounts of sulphur and their effectiveness in supplying soluble calcium, and the exchangeable sodium status of each soil, results varied according to such factors as rate of oxidation of the amendment, lime content of the soil, soluble salts present in the soil, and soil texture...|$|E
40|$|Dionysias {{are high}} alpine plants which are {{restricted}} {{in the wild}} and scarce in cultivation. Fourteen species have been cultured in vitro, but weaning has proved difficult, due to water status difficulties with the plant material. Physiological aspects of this problem have been investigated. Acetate peels from adaxial leaf surfaces showed that control of stomatal density was lost during in vitro culture. Studies of the juxtaposition of glands and stomata showed that, apart from stomata of pot grown (de novo) material, clustering occurred for both structures. Glands appeared to progressively inhibit adjacent stomatal development, from de novo material where no inhibition occurred, to cultures subject to water stress where inhibition was pronounced. Experiments to determine the affect of stomatal density on weaning showed that only plants with very low stomatal densities survived to root. Stomatal apertures, determined by floating leaves in water or ABA solutions, fixing and removing epidermal strips, {{were found to be}} similar, independent of treatment. Epidermal strips were removed and stained with sodium cobaltinitrite and <b>ammonium</b> <b>polysulphide</b> solutions to determine potassium accumulation in the guard cells. Low levels of potassium were found for all treatments. Higher accumulations were found in flaccid material. Cation accumulations in leaf material were analysed by atomic emission and atomic absorption for sample solutions prepared by dry combustion. The K:Na ratio was found to drop in vitro cultures,, but could be ameliorated by increasing the pH and/or calcium concentration of the media. No amelioration of stomatal operation was found. Samples of farina from eight species, including in vitro and de novo material, were collected by washing leaves in acetone. Differences in farinal composition, revealed by TLC, were found between species, suggesting the possibility of a chemotaxonomic classification. Some quantitative and qualitative differences were found between in vitro and de novo material. It would appear that some biochemical changes occur during in vitro culture. It is postulated that the morphological adaptions shown by Dionysia aretiodes regulate water loss and account for the apparent lack of stomatal functionality. Physiological differences occur when plant material is cultured in vitro, but no effective treatments to improve weaning were found. The survival and rooting of propagules from culture appears linked to water loss as a result of stomatal density and developmental epidermal patterns...|$|E
