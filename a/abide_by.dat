5|$|Democrats {{were divided}} on the {{monetary}} issue. Their eventual nominee, Parker Watkins Hardin, {{was known to be}} a free silver supporter, but he pledged to <b>abide</b> <b>by</b> whatever platform the convention adopted. That platform was ambiguous with regard to the gold and silver question; it praised President Grover Cleveland and his treasury secretary, native Kentuckian John G. Carlisle, both gold supporters, and endorsed the national Democratic platform of 1892. Most believed this meant the platform favored gold, although silverites like Ollie M. James contended that the 1892 platform favored silver. Consequently, most Democrats left the convention not knowing where their nominee would stand on the money question.|$|E

5|$|From the mid-14th century, {{after the}} Black Death, Norman {{settlements}} in Ireland {{went into a}} period of decline. The Norman rulers and the Gaelic Irish elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became Gaelicised. In some parts, a hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged. In response, the Irish parliament passed the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1367. These were a set of laws designed to prevent the assimilation of the Normans into Irish society by requiring English subjects in Ireland to speak English, follow English customs and <b>abide</b> <b>by</b> English law.|$|E

Sukarno disagreed, which was a blow to Sudirman. When Sudirman threatened to resign his post, blaming the government's inconsistency for his tuberculosis and Oerip's death in November 1948, Sukarno threatened to do so as well. As he thought that such a resignation would have a destabilising effect, Sudirman stayed his hand, and a Java-wide cease fire came into effect on 11August 1949.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those in}} the police force, many in the medical {{profession}} were reluctant to <b>abide</b> <b>by</b> the new laws. From September 30, gun applicants had to hand in a medical health evaluation (certifying that they were mentally sound enough to bear arms), carried out by a doctor, {{to gain access to}} a weapon. The Finnish Medical Association opposed this on the grounds that doctors were already overburdened with work, and Basic Services Minister Paula Risikko suggested that more medical workers could be employed by police departments instead.|$|E

The MPLA government responded to Savimbi's statement by moving troops from Cuito Cuanavale, under MPLA control, to UNITA-occupied Mavinga. The ceasefire broke down with dos Santos and the U.S. government blaming {{each other for the}} resumption in armed conflict.|$|E

5|$|On November 26, 1861, Governor Johnson {{issued an}} address to the {{citizens}} of the Commonwealth blaming abolitionists for the breakup of the United States.

He further announced his willingness to resign as provisional governor if the Kentucky General Assembly would agree to cooperate with Governor Magoffin.

On the other hand, he was an opponent of coercion, and due to Kentucky's proximity to the Southern states, maintained a more sympathetic view of the southern cause than legislators from more northern states. During his term as governor, Powell had been critical of Northern states that refused to <b>abide</b> <b>by</b> the Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of Nri was a religio-polity, {{a sort of}} theocratic state, that {{developed}} in the central heartland of the Igbo region. The Nri had a taboo symbolic code with six types. These included human (such as twins), animal, object, temporal, behavioral, speech and place taboos. The rules regarding these taboos were used to educate and govern Nri's subjects.
