Fearing for Sivaji's life, she hands over Sivaji's laptop to the CBI and Income Tax officers hired by Adiseshan with all the information regarding the illegal money transactions. With presentable evidence, Sivaji is arrested.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, {{probably}} in 1213, he took Dyrrhachium from Venice, followed in 1214 by Corfu. Very {{little is known}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> these successes, as the generally hostile stance of the pro-Nicaean Byzantine historians towards Michael means that his achievements were often ignored. According to local Corfiot tradition, the castle of Angelokastro was built by Michael. Michael continued to push northward into Albania and Macedonia, taking Kruja and ending {{the independence of the}} principality of Arbanon and its ruler, Dimitri Progoni, but his attempt to seize Zeta was stopped by the Serbs at Skadar.|$|E
5|$|The series {{depicts the}} adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life {{as a high school}} student while {{moonlighting}} as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica resolves the mystery of her sexual assault a year earlier by talking to previous acquaintances and learning <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> what happened at Shelly Pomroy's party a year earlier while she was under the influence of GHB. Meanwhile, Duncan (Teddy Dunn) returns from running away earlier, and Veronica and Logan's relationship matures as she reacts to the news that he had roofies the night of the party.|$|E

5|$|As Anderson {{remained}} {{throughout her}} life evasive <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> {{her life as}} a commercial writer, it is not known when she began writing commercially under pseudonyms, what those pseudonyms were, or, indeed, how much she wrote. She revealed only that she began writing for magazines and newspapers out of commercial necessity, and rarely under her own name. Although she achieved success later in this field, she sometimes stated that, as her writing improved, her pieces were more frequently turned down for publication. In her thirties, she began to write for commercial radio. Beginning with half-hour slots, Anderson gradually became interested in the technique of crafting radio plays, and began submitting some of her better work to the ABC under her own name. She later ascribed her fondness for writing the expansive dialogue in her novels to her early experience writing radio plays.|$|E
5|$|One {{day before}} senior year, Veronica is working {{a job at}} a {{restaurant}}. Soon, a boy named Kelvin (Charles Duckworth) comes into the restaurant and says that he failed his drug test, even though he has been clean for ten months. Veronica sees an interview with her father, Keith (Enrico Colantoni), on TV, and it is revealed that he wrote a book about the Lilly Kane case. The episode then flashes back to the romantic cliffhanger at the end of season one, and it is revealed that Logan was at the door. Logan reveals that the biker gang beat him up after he kicked Weevil (Francis Capra) in the face. Although he woke up with a knife and found one of the gang members was stabbed, Logan tells Veronica that he did not stab the gang member, and Veronica believes him. However, Leo (Max Greenfield) comes and arrests Logan. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) says that he and Meg (Alona Tal) also failed their drug test. Wallace informs Veronica <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> the drug test, and the episode flashes back to show the details of Veronica and Logan starting to date over the summer. Veronica talks to all the students who were framed in the drug test, and they all say some people might want to harm them. Veronica has become estranged from Meg, and Veronica reveals that Logan was released from prison soon after he was arrested.|$|E

25|$|The most general {{interpretation}} of entropy is {{as a measure}} of our uncertainty about a system. The equilibrium state of a system maximizes the entropy because we have lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables; maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> the system. This uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.|$|E
25|$|Though {{not much}} is known <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> his early life, Jonathan Clarkson Gibbs {{grew up in}} a Philadelphia where anti-black riots and {{violence}} were quite common.

Both brothers eventually converted to Presbyterianism. Gibbs impressed the Presbyterian assembly such that the Assembly provided financial backing for him to attend Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, New Hampshire.|$|E

The government faced the problem that a key piece of evidence – Lindh's confession – might be excluded from evidence as having been forced under duress (i.e. torture).|$|E
25|$|When Germany invaded Norway on April 9, 1940, many of Norway’s {{commanding}} {{officers of}} both the Army and the Navy were uncertain {{of what to do}} since they did not receive any orders. This led to many giving up without mounting a defence. Although the highest levels of government ordered an immediate mobilization, the ministers of the Norwegian government knew nothing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> mobilization, which were left totally to the Ministry of Defence. Since the Minister of Defence was new to his duties, he deferred this action to his Commander-in Chief, General Kristian Laake.|$|E
25|$|As noted, {{not much}} is known <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> the structure. The church was built with five domes: the central dome was {{dedicated}} to Christ while the four smaller ones housed chapels of the four other saints to whom the church was dedicated. The exact arrangement of the domes {{and the type of}} the church are disputed. Most scholars consider it to have been a cross-in-square structure, similar to the later Myrelaion and Lips Monastery churches. Indeed, the widespread use of this type throughout the Orthodox world, from the Balkans to Russia, is commonly ascribed to the prestige of this imperial building.|$|E

25|$|Bakhtin's {{works and}} ideas gained {{popularity}} after his death, and he endured difficult conditions {{for much of}} his professional life, a time in which information was often seen as dangerous and therefore often hidden. As a result, the details provided now are often of uncertain accuracy. Also contributing to the imprecision of these details is the limited access to Russian archival information during Bakhtin’s life. It is only after the archives became public that scholars realized that much of what they thought they knew <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> Bakhtin’s life was false or skewed largely by Bakhtin himself.|$|E
25|$|Since {{conscious}} awareness {{has to be}} {{coupled with}} local physical systems, the observer’s physical environment has to interact and can influence the brain. The brain itself must have some physico-chemical processes that affect the states of awareness. If these neural processes can be described and analyzed then some experiments could potentially be created to test whether affecting neural processes can {{have an effect on}} a quantum system. Speculation <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> this awareness-local physical system coupling on a purely theoretical basis could occur, however experimentally searching for them through neurological and psychological studies would be ideal.|$|E
25|$|In November 2016, Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly {{wrote in}} her book <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> her sexual abuse {{allegations}} against Ailes. According to Kelly, when she first joined Fox News, Ailes would have meetings with her, during which he would make sexual remarks. He also tried to kiss her several times during a closed-door meeting, but {{she was able to}} get away and leave the office. After that incident in 2006, Kelly says that Ailes did not sexually harass her again. Then, in 2016, when Gretchen Carlson first made her sexual abuse allegations, Fox pressured Kelly to defend Ailes, which she refused to do.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{implementation of}} social choice functions where the central planner has no knowledge <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> model specifications, {{and only a}} few individuals participate in the mechanism. In contrast with the standard model of implementation, each agent has non-consequential moral preference in that she prefers truth-telling to lying whenever the resulting consequence is unchanged. We show that with complete information, there exists a single, detail-free mechanism that can implement any social choice function whenever agents regard its value as being socially desirable. This result holds even if psychological cost for lying is close to zero. Non-consequential moral preferences play a very powerful role in eliminating unwanted equilibria in detail-free mechanism design with representative systems. We extend this result to incomplete information. ...|$|R

5000|$|Little {{is known}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{earliest}} Stewartons, {{but during the}} second half of the 19th century several enthusiasts recorded <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design and their experience of using the hive. Most notable of these was John McCulloch McPhedran, who wrote regularly in the British Bee Journal as 'The Renfrewshire Beekeeper'. More recently, Dr. Eva Crane has summarised information, although, as with many aspects of bee keeping history, detail appears to have been overlooked, and a few 'modern myths' have been allowed to develop. Dr. Crane correctly asserts that the Stewarton [...] "kept the queen out of the honey boxes" [...] thus allowing the beekeeper to secure a crop of honey free from contamination from brood. However, the Stewarton hive was apparently the first to allow unlimited expansion simply by adding extra boxes.|$|R
25|$|A {{weighted}} matroid is a matroid {{together with}} a function from its elements to the nonnegative real numbers. The weight of a subset of elements is defined to be {{the sum of the}} weights of the elements in the subset. The greedy algorithm can be used to find a maximum-weight basis of the matroid, by starting from the empty set and repeatedly adding one element at a time, at each step choosing a maximum-weight element among the elements whose addition would preserve the independence of the augmented set. This algorithm does not need to know anything <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> the matroid's definition, as long as it has access to the matroid through an independence oracle, a subroutine for testing whether a set is independent.|$|E
25|$|The Caproni Ca.6, {{the sixth}} {{airplane}} built by Gianni Caproni, was a pioneering biplane that featured an innovative variable-pitch propeller (the pitch of whose blades, however, could be adjusted {{only on the}} ground) and an unusual double-cambered airfoil. The latter was suggested to Caproni by his friend and colleague, Henri Coandă, but proved unsuccessful. The Caproni Ca.6 {{on display at the}} museum is the only aircraft of its type to have been produced, and it is also the oldest aircraft in the collection, dating back to 1911. Because of its structural fragility and lack of information, such as plans or drawings <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft's original construction, it did not undergo restoration. The Caproni Ca.6 did, however, go through a conservation treatment.|$|E
25|$|Two {{facets of}} the result came under {{particular}} scrutiny within the neutrino community: the GPS synchronization system, and {{the profile of the}} proton beam spill that generated neutrinos. The second concern was addressed in the November rerun: for this analysis, OPERA scientists repeated the measurement over the same baseline using a new CERN proton beam which circumvented the need to make any assumptions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> neutrino production during the beam activation, such as energy distribution or production rate. This beam provided proton pulses of 3nanoseconds each with up to 524 nanosecond gaps. This meant a detected neutrino could be tracked uniquely to its generating 3 nanoseconds pulse, and hence its start and end travel times could be directly noted. Thus, the neutrino's speed could now be calculated without having to resort to statistical inference.|$|E
30|$|The results {{revealed}} that cytotoxicity exhibited dose- and time-dependent effects for different kinds of ZnO NPs. ZnO induces oxidative stress, decreases viability, and increases cell death in Caco- 2 cells. The 26 -nm ZnO NPs appeared to have the highest toxicity. Different sizes of ZnO NPs could cause {{a significant reduction in}} GSH and with increase in ROS and LDH. ZnO could also cause reduction of the G 1 phase and an increase in the S phase and the G 2 phase cells to repair damaged genes, while no differences were obtained between 62 -nm and 90 -nm ZnO NPs. Finally, there is still little knowledge <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> ZnO toxicity related with the nanoparticle sizes, including how they are transported in cells and how nanoparticles interact with the cell membrane and organelles.|$|R
