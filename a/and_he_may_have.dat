5|$|Although {{little is}} known about the exact nature of Tréhot's {{relationship}} with Renoir while she was modeling; she is said to have given birth to a baby boy named Pierre on 14 December 1868, but it is unclear what became of him <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> died as an infant. On 21 July 1870, Tréhot gave birth to a baby girl named Jeanne (d. 1934) who was given to a wet nurse to raise as her own. Renoir continued to secretly support Jeanne financially until he died (and after his death with the help of Ambroise Vollard), but never publicly or legally acknowledged that she was his daughter during his lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Born about 1110, Foliot {{became a}} monk of Cluny, {{probably}} in about 1130. He became Prior of Cluny Abbey, then Prior of Abbeville, a Cluniac house. There are some indications that he studied law at Bologna, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> studied under Robert Pullen, the English theologian, either at Oxford or Exeter. He also acquired {{a knowledge of}} rhetoric {{as well as the}} liberal arts. The names of two of his early teachers are known, but nothing else of them. Foliot also learned biblical exegesis, probably from Pullen.|$|E

5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1503, Leonardo had no income source, which may in part explain his {{interest}} in a private portrait. But later that year, he most likely had to delay his work on Mona Lisa when he received payment for starting The Battle of Anghiari, which was a more valuable commission and one he was contracted to complete by February of 1505. In 1506 Leonardo considered the portrait unfinished. He was not paid for the work and did not deliver it to his client. The artist's paintings traveled with him throughout his life, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> completed Mona Lisa many years later in France, in one estimation by 1516.|$|E
5|$|In 1153 Neville {{was serving}} the future King Henry. In 1156 Neville was {{exempted}} from paying danegeld on his lands in Lincolnshire, {{some of which}} were lands held previously by Gilbert de Neville. Henry also granted Neville lands around Marlborough around this time, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> later had custody of Marlborough Castle, as his son Ives was in charge of work done on the castle in 1176. By 1163, Neville was in charge of hearing the pleas of the forest in Oxfordshire, and possibly also Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Leicestershire, Warwickshire, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, and Northamptonshire.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} part of the 12th century, the manor passed from the second Baron of Dunham Massey to Matthew de Bromale. According to Dean, Matthew's father is said to have founded the de Bromale family, naming himself after the manor, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been related to or a {{follower}} of the de Masseys. He may have also held the manor at some point. The de Bromales held the manor until 1370 when Alice de Bromale married John de Davenport, and the family name was changed.|$|E

5|$|Oda's {{parents were}} Danish, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> {{been born in}} East Anglia. His father {{was said to have}} been a Dane who came to England in 865, {{together}} with the Viking army of Ubba and Ivar, and presumably settled in East Anglia. Oda's nephew Oswald of Worcester later became Archbishop of York. It is possible that Oswald's relatives Oscytel, afterwards Archbishop of York, and Thurcytel, an abbot, were also relatives of Oda, but this is not known for sure.|$|E
5|$|Sigurd {{was the son}} of Hlodvir Thorfinnson and (according to the Norse sagas) {{a direct}} descendent of Torf-Einarr Rognvaldson. Sigurd's tenure as earl was {{apparently}} free of the kin-strife that beset some other incumbents of this title {{and he was able to}} pursue his military ambitions over a wide area. He also held lands in the north of mainland Scotland and in the Sudrøyar, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been instrumental in the defeat of Gofraid mac Arailt, King of the Isles. The Annals of Ulster record his death at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, the earliest known reference to the earldom of Orkney.|$|E
5|$|Various biographers have {{proposed}} that Darwin avoided or delayed making his ideas public for personal reasons. Reasons suggested have included fear of religious persecution or social disgrace if his views were revealed, and concern about upsetting his clergymen naturalist friends or his pious wife Emma. Charles Darwin's illness caused repeated delays. His paper on Glen Roy had proved embarrassingly wrong, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> {{wanted to be sure}} he was correct. David Quammen has suggested all these factors may have contributed, and notes Darwin's large output of books and busy family life during that time.|$|E

5|$|Around AD 30, Jesus and his {{followers}} traveled from Galilee to Jerusalem to observe Passover. Jesus caused a disturbance in the Second Temple, which {{was the center of}} Jewish religious and civil authority. Sanders associates it with Jesus' prophecy that the Temple would be totally demolished. Jesus had a last meal with his disciples, which is the origin of the Christian sacrament of bread and wine. Jesus' words are recorded in the Synoptics and in Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians. The differences in the accounts cannot be completely reconciled, and {{it is impossible to know}} what Jesus intended, but in general the meal seems to point forward to the coming Kingdom. Jesus probably expected to be killed, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> hoped that God would intervene.|$|E
5|$|At the 1968 Republican National Convention, Agnew, who {{had earlier}} {{been asked to}} place Richard Nixon's name in nomination, was {{selected}} as running mate by Nixon and his campaign staff. Agnew's centrist reputation interested Nixon, and the law and order stance he had taken {{in the wake of}} civil unrest that year appealed to aides such as Pat Buchanan. Agnew made a number of gaffes during the campaign, but his rhetoric pleased many Republicans, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> made the difference in several key states. Nixon and Agnew defeated the Democratic ticket, incumbent vice president, Hubert Humphrey for president, and his running mate, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie. As vice president, Agnew was often called upon to attack the administration's enemies. In the years of his vice presidency, Agnew moved to the right, appealing to conservatives who were suspicious of moderate stances taken by Nixon. In 1972, Nixon and Agnew were reelected for a second term, defeating Senator George McGovern of South Dakota and former ambassador Sargent Shriver of Maryland.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of death, Lindow Man was a healthy male in his mid-20s, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been someone of high status, as his body shows little {{evidence}} of heavy or rough work. There has been debate over the reason for Lindow Man's death, for {{the nature of his}} demise was violent, perhaps ritualistic; after a last meal of charred bread, Lindow Man was strangled, hit on the head, and his throat cut. Dating the body has proven problematic, but it is thought that Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss, face down, some time between 2 BC and 119AD, in either the Iron Age or Romano-British period. The body has been preserved by freeze-drying and is on permanent display at the British Museum, although it occasionally travels to other venues such as the Manchester Museum.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by Sam Newton that Ecgric {{may in fact be}} identical to Eni's son Æthelric, whose descendants became kings of East Anglia. Æthelric's son Ealdwulf ruled from about 664 to 713. After Ecgric's death, three other sons of Eni ruled in succession before Ealdwulf, an indication that Raedwald's line was extinct. Æthelric's marriage to Hereswith suggests that it was expected that he would rule East Anglia <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been promoted by Edwin before 632. Æthelric was apparently dead by 647, at which time Anna was already ruling and Hereswith had gone to Gaul to lead a religious life. It has therefore been argued that Æthelric and Ecgric were in fact the same person, a suggestion that is disputed by the historian Barbara Yorke, who notes that the two names are too distinct to be compatible.|$|E
5|$|Stephen then {{agreed to}} a truce {{proposed}} by his brother, Henry of Blois; the full details of the truce are not known, but the results were that Stephen first released Matilda from the siege and then allowed her and her household of knights to be escorted to the south-west, where they were reunited with Robert of Gloucester. The reasoning behind Stephen's decision to release his rival remains unclear. Contemporary chroniclers suggested that Henry argued {{that it would be}} in Stephen's own best interests to release the Empress and concentrate instead on attacking Robert, and Stephen may have seen Robert, not the Empress, as his main opponent {{at this point in the}} conflict. Stephen also faced a military dilemma at Arundel—the castle was considered almost impregnable, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been worried that he was tying down his army in the south whilst Robert roamed freely in the west. Another theory is that Stephen released Matilda out of a sense of chivalry; Stephen was certainly known for having a generous, courteous personality and women were not normally expected to be targeted in Anglo-Norman warfare.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{sometimes}} {{included in}} his theological books an {{acknowledgement of the}} predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave {{the details of his}} sources, should be preserved by the copyist, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers—he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all {{to be found in the}} Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's Encyclopedia, for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his De temporum ratione.|$|E

5|$|Born in Kirkheaton, Hirst first {{achieved}} {{success for}} Yorkshire as a bowler who could bat a little. Over his first few seasons, his batting {{developed at the}} expense of his bowling until he was regarded mainly as a specialist batsman. Around 1900, his bowling re-emerged when he discovered a method to make the ball swing in the air after he released it. He {{was one of the first}} bowlers to control the swing of the ball; batsmen found it very difficult to counter this method and Hirst's bowling was subsequently far more successful. From 1903 he achieved 11 consecutive doubles. He set records in 1905, when he scored 341 runs in an innings against Leicestershire—still the highest total for Yorkshire as of 2015—and in 1906, when he completed an unprecedented and unrepeated double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets. In many seasons, he battled injury which reduced his effectiveness, but his bowling remained successful until shortly before the First World War. Hirst played in all England's home Test series between 1899 and 1909, but his record for England was less impressive than his record for Yorkshire <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> suffered from playing in Australia where playing conditions did not suit him.|$|E
5|$|This {{effectively}} left Pistrucci {{with little}} {{to do at the}} Mint. He created several medallic works, for example a small memorial medal for the King's brother, Frederick, Duke of York in 1827 that was popular, in royal circles, mounted in rings. He was asked to design the Coronation medal after King William IV came to the throne on George's death in 1830, but declined as he was asked to copy a bust by Chantrey, and the King refused to sit for him. He created, in 1830–1831, the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal, the first non-campaign medal of the British Army. He took twelve months to do so, a period of time Craig found unduly long. He continued to cut cameos, and to work, slowly, on the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci's biographer, Michael A. March, tied his disinclination to work on the Waterloo Medal to his unhappiness about his position at the Mint, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> concluded that he would be sacked if he finished the medal. In 1836, the new Master, Henry Labouchere, stated that he felt the medal could be finished in 18 months, and offered Pistrucci payment if he would take on four apprentices and finish it. Pistrucci declined.|$|E
