40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim in {{analyzing}} a 2 k factorial design is {{to estimate the}} 2 k main <b>and</b> <b>interaction</b> effects. If some of these main <b>and</b> <b>interaction</b> effects {{are known to be}} zero or negligible, {{it is not necessary to}} estimate all the main <b>and</b> <b>interaction</b> effects in 2 k factorial design. When S main <b>and</b> <b>interaction</b> effects are non-zero, all possible sets of S treatment combinations are not sufficient for estimating these main <b>and</b> <b>interaction</b> effects. For this reason, a method is introduced to obtain the smallest set of the S treatment combinations. In this study, two smallest sets are obtained for all possible scenarios of interest for 23 factorial design using this method given by Tsao and Wibowo. An illustration of this method is solved for 23 factorial design by using SPSS 13. 0 package program...|$|R

5|$|Once fusion begins, the {{temperature}} of the white dwarf increases. A main sequence star supported by thermal pressure can expand and cool which automatically regulates the increase in thermal energy. However, degeneracy pressure is independent of temperature; white dwarfs are unable to regulate temperature in the manner of normal stars, so they are vulnerable to runaway fusion reactions. The flare accelerates dramatically, in part due to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability <b>and</b> <b>interactions</b> with turbulence. It is still a matter of considerable debate whether this flare transforms into a supersonic detonation from a subsonic deflagration.|$|E

The purposes of this thesis are (1) to investigate the roles of physical setting, especially on building and site scale, and its influence to foster communication <b>and</b> <b>interaction</b> in large organizations, and (2) to explore analytical tools and techniques to verify the performance of workplace spatial attributes <b>and</b> <b>interaction</b> patterns. 	Employing the archival data of <b>interaction</b> patterns <b>and</b> physical data acquired from satellite images and GIS, This thesis investigates the relationship between spatial attributes <b>and</b> <b>interaction</b> emerged in four corporate campuses, including Goldman Sachs, Sprint, Sun Microsystems, and Toyota Motor Sale. 	The analysis reveals that there are very low correlations for both relationships between floor plate area <b>and</b> <b>interaction,</b> <b>and</b> relationships between floor plate ratio <b>and</b> <b>interaction.</b> In addition, there is no predictable trend between the average travel time between building <b>and</b> the average <b>interaction</b> frequency. 	There is a moderate correlation between actual travel time and self-reported or perceived travel time. The thesis also suggests that the self-reported travel time tends to be under-estimated by the employees. The actual travel time, however, has more impact on interaction in compact campuses than in dispersed campuses...|$|R

5|$|Durkheim saw {{religion}} {{as the most}} fundamental social institution of humankind, and one {{that gave rise to}} other social forms.

Over time, as emotions became symbolized <b>and</b> <b>interactions</b> ritualized, religion became more organized, giving a rise to the division between the sacred and the profane. However, Durkheim also believed that religion was becoming less important, as it was being gradually superseded by science and the cult of an individual.|$|E

5|$|One {{attempt to}} {{overcome}} these limitations is string theory, a quantum theory not of point particles, but of minute one-dimensional extended objects.

In what is called the second superstring revolution, it was conjectured that both string theory and a unification of general relativity and supersymmetry known as supergravity form part of a hypothesized eleven-dimensional model known as M-theory, which would constitute a uniquely defined and consistent theory of quantum gravity.|$|E

5|$|The oldest exposed flows on Mauna Loa {{are thought}} to be the Ninole Hills on its {{southern}} flank, subaerial basalt rock dating back approximately 100 to 200 thousand years. They form a terrace against which younger flows have since banked, heavily eroded and incised against its slope in terms of direction; this {{is believed to be the}} result of a period of erosion because of a change in the direction of lava flow caused by the volcano's prehistoric slump. These are followed by two units of lava flows separated by an intervening ash layer known as the Pāhala ash layer: the older Kahuka basalt, sparsely exposed on the lower southwest rift, and the younger and far more widespread Kaʻu basalt, which appear more widely on the volcano. The Pāhala ashes themselves were produced over a long period of time circa 13 to 30 thousand years ago, although heavy vitrification <b>and</b> <b>interactions</b> with post and pre- creation flows has hindered exact dating. Their age roughly corresponding with the glaciation of Mauna Loa during the last ice age, raising the distinct possibility that it is the product of phreatomagmatic interaction between the long-gone glaciers and Mauna Loa's eruptive activities.|$|E
5|$|The pink whipray is {{valuable}} to ecotourism at {{sites in the}} Maldives, French Polynesia, and elsewhere; they are attracted to visitors in large numbers {{by the promise of}} food. The government of the Maldives has taken steps to preserve ray ecotourism by banning all exports of ray products in 1995. In 2005, stingray ecotourism at Moorea brought in over €500,000. However, a 2008 study of Moorea whiprays found a negative effect of ecotourism in the form of bite and impact injuries, stemming from artificially high ray density <b>and</b> <b>interactions</b> with boat traffic at the feeding sites. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the pink whipray as Vulnerable overall.

5|$|The term {{attachment}} {{disorder is}} used to describe emotional and behavioral problems of young children, and also applied to school-age children, teenagers and adults. The specific difficulties implied depend on {{the age of the}} individual being assessed, and a child's attachment-related behaviors may be very different with one familiar adult than with another, suggesting that the disorder is within the relationship <b>and</b> <b>interactions</b> of the two people rather than an aspect of one or the other personality. No list of symptoms can legitimately be presented but generally the term attachment disorder refers to the absence or distortion of age appropriate social behaviors with adults. For example, in a toddler, attachment-disordered behavior could include a failure to stay near familiar adults in a strange environment or to be comforted by contact with a familiar person, whereas in a six-year-old attachment-disordered behavior might involve excessive friendliness and inappropriate approaches to strangers.|$|E
