500|$|Ultima Underworld II {{was built}} with an {{improved}} {{version of the}} game engine used for its predecessor. The team enhanced its visual capabilities: they broadened the first-person view by 30%, expanded the color palette, added more 3D objects, increased the size and animation of character sprites and wrote a new texture mapping algorithm. Director Paul Neurath commented that Ultima Underworlds texture mapping had failed to [...] "look quite <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> had hoped", and that the new system realized their vision. The game's code is roughly 30% larger than that of Ultima Underworld—bloat that Church attributed to [...] "second project syndrome".|$|E
500|$|Martin, who {{finished}} second, was candid about the result, [...] "We did really well to finish second. I just don't {{think we were}} in [...] league today." [...] In the post-race press conference, Kenseth said of his result, [...] "We didn't qualify very good, but we were really happy with our car. When the race started, I didn't think we were quite <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> were yesterday (in practice), but {{we were able to}} have really good pit stops." [...] Logano, who was involved in the biggest accident of the race, [...] "The biggest thing was, I was fine the whole time, [...] I'm not really sure what happened. The spotter was clearing me low. When I got down there, they checked up going into the corner and I got tagged from behind." ...|$|E
500|$|Lillywhite {{believed}} that the African influences had not translated well onto the album, remarking: [...] "It's a pity because {{the whole idea of}} Morocco as a big idea was great. When the big idea for U2 is good, that is when they succeed the most, but I don't think the spirit of what they set out to achieve was translated. Something happened that meant it did not come across on the record." [...] The Edge concurred, admitting that the group erred by [...] "starting out experimental and then trying to bring it into something that was more accessible". He added, [...] "I think probably we should have said, 'It's an experimental work. That's what it is.'" [...] Mullen refers to the album as [...] "No Craic on the Horizon" [...] and said, [...] "It was pretty fucking miserable. It turns out that we're not <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> thought we were and things got in the way." ...|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{began the}} season with a 2–0 home victory against {{promoted}} Birmingham City; goals from Thierry Henry and Sylvain Wiltord extended the club's winning run to fourteen matches – a new top-flight record. A late equaliser by Wiltord in their next match at West Ham United earned Arsenal a point, having trailed 2–0 in the first half. Three days later, a 5–2 win against West Bromwich Albion moved Arsenal {{to the top of the}} league table. Although they drew to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, having lost captain Vieira through a sending-off, a win against Manchester City meant Arsenal leapfrogged local rivals Tottenham Hotspur to first position. A 3–0 win at Charlton Athletic on 15 September 2002 pleased Wenger, who indicated after the match the league was theirs to lose: [...] "We know we can win the league. We know we can be stronger. At this stage last season we were not <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> are now." [...] Striker Kanu scored a stoppage time winner against Bolton Wanderers to win their eleventh successive home game.|$|E
500|$|McCready said, [...] "I'd {{sum it up}} {{as kind of a}} tight, concise, rock 'n' roll {{record with}} kind of pop or maybe new wave {{elements}} to it... It's a really quick record, but I like that element to it. I like the sparseness of the songs and the way that Brendan pulled us together and made us play <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> could." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that [...] "prior to Backspacer, Pearl Jam wouldn't or couldn't have made music this unfettered, unapologetically assured, casual, and, yes, fun." [...] Vedder stated, [...] "The new record feels good so far—really strong and uptempo, stuff we can sink our teeth into", and added that the band's live performances inspired the album's sound: [...] "At one of our gigs, without flashpots and electricity, there's only so much room for those difficult listening songs. That's one reason we kept the arrangements lean." [...] The singer cited Guided by Voices as a reference in creating the shorter and faster songs of Backspacer. Gossard said that Backspacer is [...] "what we could have done for the last five records, in terms of re-engaging with the roots of why this band works", and that [...] "there's plenty of ballads, too... and there's some shifts in how Jeff and Matt and I are all relating—I think this record's got a chance to sound significantly different." [...] Ament said, [...] "There's a couple of great things that Ed brought in that could be real departures for us. Whatever wave Ed caught with [...] Into the Wild has taken him to different places." ...|$|E

I think we did all we could. We just came up a tiny bit short." ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 10, 1961, she {{received}} a Doctor Honoris Causa in Historical Sciences by Moscow State University for her contributions {{to the development of}} Marxist theory. In her acceptance speech she asserted that class struggle is the motor of history. In 1962 she attended the 10th Congress of the Italian Communist Party held December 2–8 in Rome where she met Socialists, Christian-Democrats and some church representatives. To the clerics she remarked, [...] "We are not as wicked as you think, and we are not <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> probably think we are." [...] During {{the first few months of}} 1963 Ibárruri unsuccessfully appealed for the Spanish government to spare the life of executive committee member Julián Grimau. Before his execution Grimau wrote to Ibárruri saying, [...] "My execution will be the last one." [...] On the week of May 13 Ibárruri unveiled a plaque in his honour on Building 11, Block 1, of newly renamed Grimau Street in Moscow. On December 5 she arrived in Havana to commemorate the 5th anniversary of the Cuban Revolution. [...] Cuban leader Fidel Castro invited Ibárruri to move permanently to the island, but she declined.|$|E

6000|$|Flora Schuyler {{smiled a}} trifle drily.
