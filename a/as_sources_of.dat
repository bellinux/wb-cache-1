Blood {{bacterial}} wilt disease of banana: {{the distribution of}} pathogen in infected plant, symptoms, and potentiality <b>of</b> diseased tissues <b>as</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> infective inoculums. Nusantara Bioscience 3 : 112 - 117. Bacterial wilt caused by blood disease bacterium (BDB) {{is the most important}} disease of banana in Indonesia. The disease was difficult to control due to by poorly understood of ecology and epidemiology of the disease. This paper reports the distribution of pathogen infected plant, symptoms, and potentiality <b>of</b> diseased tissues <b>as</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> inoculums. For studying the distribution of BDB in diseased banana, a number of 14 points of plant organ tissue was sampled and the pathogen was detected by PCR using a couple of specific primer for BDB, 121 F and 121 R. In addition to the detection of BDB using PCR, both external and internal symptoms were observed. All the points of detection were also used <b>as</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> inoculums to search the potentiality <b>of</b> the tissues <b>as</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> infective inoculums. The results showed that BDB was distributed systemically in infected banana.

5|$|A later model {{suggested}} that confinement {{resulted from a}} co-rotational eccentricity resonance (CER). The model {{takes into account the}} finite mass of the Adams ring, which is necessary to move the resonance closer to the ring. A byproduct of this theory is a mass estimate for the Adams ring—about 0.002 of the mass of Galatea. A third theory proposed in 1986 requires an additional moon orbiting inside the ring; the arcs in this case are trapped in its stable Lagrangian points. However Voyager 2s observations placed strict constraints on the size and mass of any undiscovered moons, making such a theory unlikely. Some other more complicated theories hold that a number of moonlets are trapped in co-rotational resonances with Galatea, providing confinement of the arcs and simultaneously serving <b>as</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> the dust.|$|E

These microbial processes are important in global biogeochemical cycles such as acetogenesis, nitrification and denitrification and are critical for soil fertility.|$|E

5|$|In special relativity, {{energy is}} closely {{connected}} to momentum. Just as {{space and time}} are, in that theory, different aspects of a more comprehensive entity called spacetime, energy and momentum are merely different aspects of a unified, four-dimensional quantity that physicists call four-momentum. In consequence, if energy {{is a source of}} gravity, momentum must be a source as well. The same is true for quantities that are directly related to energy and momentum, namely internal pressure and tension. Taken together, in general relativity it is mass, energy, momentum, pressure and tension that serve <b>as</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> gravity: they are how matter tells spacetime how to curve. In the theory's mathematical formulation, all these quantities are but aspects of a more general physical quantity called the energy–momentum tensor.|$|E
5|$|Numerous works, {{from the}} ancient to the baroque, have been cited <b>as</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> {{inspiration}} for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She {{is often described as}} looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.|$|E
5|$|Of Jupiter's moons, eight are regular {{satellites}} with prograde {{and nearly}} circular orbits {{that are not}} greatly inclined with respect to Jupiter's equatorial plane. The Galilean satellites are nearly spherical in shape due to their planetary mass, and so would be considered (dwarf) planets {{if they were in}} direct orbit around the Sun. The other four regular satellites are much smaller and closer to Jupiter; these serve <b>as</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> the dust that makes up Jupiter's rings. The remainder of Jupiter's moons are irregular satellites whose prograde and retrograde orbits are much farther from Jupiter and have high inclinations and eccentricities. These moons were probably captured by Jupiter from solar orbits. Eighteen of the irregular satellites have not yet been named.|$|E

5|$|Thallium {{can also}} be {{obtained}} from the smelting of lead and zinc ores. Manganese nodules found on the ocean floor contain some thallium, but the collection of these nodules has been prohibitively expensive. There is also the potential for damaging the oceanic environment. In addition, several other thallium minerals, containing 16% to 60% thallium, occur in nature as complexes of sulfides or selenides that primarily contain antimony, arsenic, copper, lead, and/or silver. These minerals are rare, and they have had no commercial importance <b>as</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> thallium. The Allchar deposit in southern Macedonia was the only area where thallium was actively mined. This deposit still contains an estimated 500tonnes of thallium, and it is a source for several rare thallium minerals, for example lorándite.|$|E

5|$|The {{equivalence}} between {{mass and}} energy, as {{expressed by the}} formula E=mc, is the most famous consequence of special relativity. In relativity, mass and energy are two different ways of describing one physical quantity. If a physical system has energy, {{it also has the}} corresponding mass, and vice versa. In particular, all properties of a body that are associated with energy, such as its temperature or the binding energy of systems such as nuclei or molecules, contribute to that body's mass, and hence act <b>as</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> gravity.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{relationship}} having declined from friendship to hatred, Bogdan-Pitești's style and his mundane interests are occasionally seen <b>as</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> inspiration for Caragiale's only novel, Craii de Curtea-Veche (completed in 1928). Some {{have noted that}} Bogdan-Pitești has {{a lot in common}} with {{at least one of the}} three protagonists. He and his wife were both characters in Ion Vinea's novels Venin de mai ("May Venom") and Lunatecii ("The Lunatics")—Alexandru as Adam Gună, Domnica as wife Iada Gună. Both novels portray the Bogdans' cultural circle, allude to their influence in making young people reject all conventionalism, and show them promoting vice as virtue. This lifestyle has taken its toll on Adam Gună, who is a physical ruin and slowly loses his hold on reality. Vinea's books repeat claims that Bogdan-Pitești was abusing drugs, and that Domnica was originally a prostitute.|$|E
