60|$|Not {{only the}} directions, {{but also the}} {{velocities}} of rotation seem thus explicable. It might naturally be supposed that the large planets would revolve on their axes more slowly than the small ones: our terrestrial experiences of big and little bodies incline us to expect this. It is a corollary from the Nebular Hypothesis, however, more especially when interpreted as above, that while large planets will rotate rapidly, small ones will rotate slowly; and we find that in fact they do so. Other things equal, a concentrating nebulous mass which is diffused through a wide space, and whose outer parts have, therefore, to travel from great distances to the common centre of gravity, will acquire a high <b>axial</b> <b>velocity</b> in course of its aggregation; and conversely with a small mass. Still more marked will be the difference where {{the form of the}} genetic ring conspires to increase the rate of rotation. Other things equal, a genetic ring which is broadest in the direction of its plane will produce a mass rotating faster than one which is broadest at right angles to its plane; and if the ring is absolutely as well as relatively broad, the rotation will be very rapid. These conditions were, as we saw, fulfilled in the case of Jupiter; and Jupiter turns round his axis in less than ten hours. Saturn, in whose case, as above explained, the conditions were less favourable to rapid rotation, takes nearly ten hours and a half. While Mars, Earth, Venus, and Mercury, whose rings must have been slender, take more than double that time: the smallest taking the longest.|$|E

40|$|The initial <b>axial</b> <b>velocities</b> for the {{positive}} and negative cytochrome c molecule-ions desorbed from a liquid matrix (3 -nitrobenzyl alcohol) using a 17 ns ultraviolet laser (266 nm) have been determined. The method employed was based upon measurement of ion flight times through a field-free path co-axial with the ion optical axis. The possible interferences, such as energy deficits, due to the presence of electric fields were avoided by using a grid-electrode placed at a very short distance from the sample stage. The potential of this electrode was maintained at the same potential as the sample stage, thereby creating a narrow field-free region within which ion generation took place. Systematic variations of the potential at a second grid-electrode caused a gradual shift of the ion flight times, which could be related to the initial ion velocities. The ion velocities were obtained by correlating the measured time-shifts with values from theoretical analysis.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{normal and}} delayed bone healing by {{measuring}} ultrasound conduction velocity across the bone callus. METHODS: A model of transverse linear and 5 mm resection osteotomies of sheep tibiae was used. Fourteen sheep were operated on and {{were divided into}} two groups of seven according to osteotomy type. The procedure was performed on the right tibiae and the intact left tibiae were used as controls. The transverse and <b>axial</b> ultrasound <b>velocities</b> were measured at 30 -day intervals for 90 days, after which the animals were killed and both the right and left tibiae were resected for in vitro biomechanical analysis. RESULTS: Both the transverse and <b>axial</b> ultrasound <b>velocities</b> progressively increased, but the increase was smaller for the delayed union that resulted from the resection osteotomy. The mechanical resistance was higher for the normally healed tibiae that resulted from a linear osteotomy; this result closely correlated with the ultrasound velocity results. Significant differences were found for the comparisons between the intact and operated tibiae in both groups and between the groups for both the transverse and <b>axial</b> ultrasound <b>velocities,</b> but the differences were greater for the latter. CONCLUSION: We conclude that in vivo transverse and <b>axial</b> ultrasound <b>velocities</b> provide highly precise information about the healing state of both linear and resection diaphyseal osteotomies, but the <b>axial</b> ultrasound <b>velocity</b> most likely has greater discriminatory power.
