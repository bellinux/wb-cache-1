50|$|Axial {{compressors}} {{are used}} in medium- to large-thrust gas turbine engines, because the alternative centrifugal units would be too heavy and too large in the cross-sectional area. At smaller sizes, the <b>axial</b> <b>blading</b> {{at the rear of}} the compressor loses its robustness and is difficult to manufacture accurately. Consequently, manufacturers tend to replace the rear stages with a centrifugal unit. The compression system is then said to be axial-centrifugal. In case of power generation, axial compressors {{are used in}} turbines which have capacity to generate more than 5 MW.|$|E

Calculates {{rate of flow}} of coolant, temperature, pressure, velocity, and heat-transfer coefficients along passage. Integrates one-dimensional momentum and energy equations along defined flow path, taking into account change in area, addition or subtraction of mass, pumping, friction, and transfer of heat.

40|$|The {{available}} data on middle-stage research compressors operating near design point {{are used to}} derive simple empirical models for the spanwise variation of three-dimensional viscous loss coefficients for middle-stage <b>axial</b> compressor <b>blading.</b> The models {{make it possible to}} quickly estimate the total loss and deviation across the blade span when the three-dimensional distribution is superimposed on the two-dimensional variation calculated for each blade element. It is noted that extrapolated estimates should be used with caution since the correlations have been derived from a limited data base...|$|R
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{design of}} an inlet {{stage for a}} two-stage, 10 / 1 pressure ratio, 2 lb/sec flow rate compressor is discussed. Initially a performance comparison was conducted for an axial, mixed flow and centrifugal second stage. A modified mixed flow configuration with tandem rotors and tandem stators was selected for the inlet stage. The term conical flow compressor was coined to describe {{a particular type of}} mixed flow compressor configuration which utilizes <b>axial</b> flow type <b>blading</b> and an increase in radius to increase the work input potential. Design details of the conical flow compressor are described...|$|R
40|$|Turbulent flow is the {{phenomenon}} characterised by the chaotic, random changes of velocity, however one may find there some repetitive patterns called eddies or coherent structures. These organised structures create stress and intensify {{the transport of}} energy. The paper concerns experimental investigations of turbulent boundary layer developing on a flat plate under the adverse pressure gradient corresponding {{to the case of}} pressure variation at <b>axial</b> compressor <b>blading.</b> The pressure gradient was generated by a proper curvature of the upper wall. The fully developed turbulence structure was achieved by appropriate triggering of the boundary layer and as a result the adverse pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer (denoted t. b. l herein) at Reθ = 3000 ÷ 6000 was achieved. The paper deals with the analysis of bursting phenomena in the t. b. l., for which the large coherent structures are responsible (Kline & Robinson, 1989). The VITA technique developed by Blackwelder and Kaplan (1976) was used to detect the structures containing most of energy in the flow. In the paper, the results of VITA detection process, based on X hot-wire signal, is presented. For interpretation of structures behaviour the shape of conditionally averaged and velocity traces recorded by X-wire was analysed. The applied quadrant analysis of time signals allowed to identify events occurring not only during bursting but also before and after the occurrence of burst. The VITA detection scheme is based on the analysis of running variance var(t,T) of detection parameter a(t) given by equation...|$|R
40|$|The {{unsteady}} and three-dimensional {{nature of}} the flow past <b>axial</b> compressor <b>blading</b> poses substantial challenges {{to the design of}} the main flow passage. High aspect ratio blading is amenable to the approach of splitting the design task between the cascade and the meridional planes. However, the three-dimensional flows increasingly affect the st age aerodynamic performance with decreasing blade aspect ratios. At very high load conditions, corner vortices can grow to two-thirds of the blade span, {{under the influence of the}} pitchwise pressure gradient, causing significant blockage and loss. A survey of treatments for three - dimensional flows highlights a variety of approaches, including longitudinal and tangential slots for suction and blowing, fences, turning vanes, fillets, and grooves. The merits and issues exposed by past implementations of these end-wall treatments are summarized. Considered together, these arrangements display a variable and open approach, which points towards an opportunity for considering a more common framework, led by a greater understanding of the flow physics. Preliminary work on the parametrization of end-wall grooves has highlighted some promising topological features of end walls generated by using the Beta distribution function as the guide curve. This seemingly unexplored application of the Beta function to axial compressor end wall design promises a better fit with the pitchwise periodic axial compressor geometry than other guide curve functions considered herein and used in the past.

40|$|Abstract The {{application}} of Menter's transition model (Menter et al. (2004 a), here-after {{known as the}} ץ - θ model) available in the CFX CFD code, for use within an axial compressor design group was studied. Simulations {{of a range of}} turbomachinery applicable test cases were undertaken, including a range of transitional flat plates and a 2 D compressor cascade. Results were com¬pared to experimental data and the results of simulations performed with standard turbulence models. The ץ - θ model significantly improved the prediction of the boundary layer development, compared to the turbulence models. Comparisons with ex¬perimental data were also good. Features such as mid-chord transitional separation bubbles were predicted with the ץ - θ model, but not with the turbulence models. The ץ - θ model offered no consistent improved accuracy over the κ - ω SST turbulence model when predicting leading edge separa¬tion bubbles. The more accurate simulation of the boundary layer enables a closer prediction of viscous losses. 2 D and 3 D unsteady simulations of a low-speed axial compressor stator blade boundary layer, subject to impinging rotor wakes, were conducted. The pur¬pose was to determine the performance of the ץ - θ model in this environment, as there is no available literature for this. For both simulations, the model gave a good qualitative agreement to experimental data in the prediction of passing rotor wake effects on the suction surface. The effects on the pressure surface transition region due to wake passing were poorly predicted. All models were simulated on low and high-speed axial compressor stages. Results showed no improvement over the turbulence models of the ץ - θ model to predict blade exit parameters. The ץ - θ model does not present a significant enough improvement in the prediction of the flow to warrant its regular use in the design of <b>axial</b> compressor <b>blading.</b> However, it presents a useful tool in the development of high lift compressor blading...|$|R
