5|$|Rossia was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} repeat of the armored cruiser , but the Director of the Naval Ministry wanted the armor to cover more of the ship's side. However the design went through a number of changes during late 1892 and early 1893 and incorporated a number of technological <b>advances</b> <b>that</b> had recently become available. One notable change was the deletion of Ruriks sailing rig.|$|E
5|$|The Presidents' Trophy {{winner is}} {{guaranteed}} home-ice advantage {{in all four}} rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs, provided the team <b>advances</b> <b>that</b> far. However, it does not guarantee that success, as only eight of all the Presidents' Trophy winners {{have gone on to}} win the Stanley Cup in their respective years, leading to a popular superstition that the Trophy may be cursed. In addition, six Presidents' Trophy winners have been eliminated in the preliminary round of the playoffs, with first-round upsets being common in the NHL compared to other major professional sports.|$|E
5|$|The {{attacks of}} 28 March were a {{continuation}} of the rapid <b>advances</b> <b>that</b> had so shattered the Fifth Army since the first days of the Spring Offensive. Prisoners of war taken by the 48th Battalion attested to {{the fact that this was}} not a set-piece assault, but merely an attack off the line of march. The 50th Reserve Division was in no state to renew the offensive on the following day, and 229 RIR was withdrawn from the line. It had suffered 309 casualties, with 230 RIR losing another 240.|$|E

5|$|This {{development}} greatly facilitated {{vaccine research}} and ultimately {{allowed for the}} development of vaccines against polio. Enders and his colleagues, Thomas H. Weller and Frederick C. Robbins, were recognized in 1954 for their labors with a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Other important <b>advances</b> <b>that</b> {{led to the development of}} polio vaccines were: the identification of three poliovirus serotypes (Poliovirus type 1 — PV1, or Mahoney; PV2, Lansing; and PV3, Leon); the finding that prior to paralysis, the virus must be present in the blood; and the demonstration that administration of antibodies in the form of gamma globulin protects against paralytic polio.|$|E
5|$|Stebbins and Edgar Anderson wrote a {{paper in}} 1954 on the {{importance}} of hybridization in adapting to new environments. They proposed novel adaptations would facilitate the invasion of habitats not utilized previously by either parent and that novel adaptations may facilitate the formation of stabilized hybrid species. Following this paper, Stebbins developed the first model of adaptive radiation. He proposed that a high degree of genetic variability was necessary for major evolutionary <b>advances,</b> <b>that</b> because of slow mutation rates, genetic recombination was the most likely source of this variation, and that variation could be maximised though hybridization. As of 2006, research is ongoing regarding whether hybridization is an accidental consequence of evolution or if it is necessary for the creation and evolution of plant species; {{it has been argued that}} contemporary studies are part of an intellectual lineage that started with the work of Stebbins and Anderson.|$|E
5|$|Thom {{held his}} {{job with the}} Bureau of Chemistry until 1927, when the {{position}} was abolished. He was then appointed Principal Mycologist of the Division of Soil Microbiology for the newly created Bureau of Chemistry and Soils. In a few years, Thom became known as an authority on soil microbiology, and was often invited to present papers at national and international meetings. In one of Thom's important contributions to the field, he led the research group responsible for <b>advances</b> <b>that</b> enabled the control of cotton root rot, {{which at the time}} was a major problem in the southwestern United States. In collaboration with his protégé Kenneth Raper, they published the Manual of Penicillin in 1940. Thom formally retired in 1942, although he remained active as a consultant and guest speaker until shortly before his death.|$|E

This was resected by Harvey Cushing at that time, and Wood made a full recovery until the tumor later recurred. The successful removal of Wood's brain tumor represented an important milestone, indicating to the public the <b>advances</b> <b>that</b> {{had been made in}} the nascent field of neurosurgery, and extending Wood's life by almost two decades.|$|E

25|$|Daniel is episodic {{rather than}} linear–it has no plot as such. It does, however, have a structure. Chapters 2-6 form a chiasm, a {{literary}} figure in which elements mirror each other: chapter 2 is the counterpart of chapter 7, chapter 3 of chapter 6, and chapter 4 of chapter 5, {{with the second}} member of each pair advancing the first in some way. Daniel 8 is then a new beginning, and the single vision contained in chapters 10-12 <b>advances</b> <b>that</b> argument further and gives it more precision.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} ZETA's failure to achieve fusion, the device {{went on to}} have a long {{experimental}} lifetime and produced numerous important advances in the field. In one line of development, the use of lasers to more accurately measure the temperature was developed on ZETA, and was later used to confirm the results of the Soviet tokamak approach. In another, while examining ZETA test runs it was noticed that the plasma self-stabilised after the power was turned off. This has led to the modern reversed field pinch concept. More generally, studies of the instabilities in ZETA have led to several important theoretical <b>advances</b> <b>that</b> form the basis of modern plasma theory.|$|E
25|$|Recombinant DNA {{technology}} arose as {{a result}} of advances in biology that began in the 1950s and 60’s. During these decades, a tradition of merging the structural, biochemical and informational approaches to the central problems of classical genetics became more apparent. Two main underlying concepts of this tradition were that genes consisted of DNA and that DNA encoded information that determined the processes of replication and protein synthesis. These concepts were embodied in the model of DNA proposed by James Watson and Francis Crick, and further research on the Watson-Crick model yielded theoretical <b>advances</b> <b>that</b> were reflected in new capacities to manipulate DNA. One of these capacities was recombinant DNA technology.|$|E

25|$|In The Movies, players get {{the chance}} to run their own movie studio. The game can be divided into three main areas – {{designing}} the movie studio, forging the careers of film stars and making films. It is possible to focus on any of those areas that appeal most, and spend less time on the others. The game plays through from the birth of cinema to the present day and into the near future, with all the technology and historical <b>advances</b> <b>that</b> occur along that timeline. After the movies have been made, they can be played back for the viewer to watch. It is possible once the movie is made to add voice, text and music in post-production.|$|E
25|$|Intense fighting, protest, strikes, {{and even}} {{political}} assassinations, all threatened {{to undermine the}} <b>advances</b> <b>that</b> Konstantin had pushed so strenuously. He then had to declare martial law and severely repressed the uprising. Although adept {{when it came to}} naval matters, Konstantin had little taste for political fights, and none for ruthlessly crushing revolts. In August 1863, he asked the emperor to relieve him of the post of Viceroy, and Alexander II, aware of how tormented his brother had become by the situation in Warsaw, accepted his resignation. The insurrection was finally quelled in May 1864, when the more conservative Count Frederik Vilhelm Rembert von Berg was sent to replace Konstantin as viceroy.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{of human}} {{trafficking}} has directly increased in correlation with globalization. Globalization has increased cross-border {{trade and the}} demand for cheap labor; however, migration policies of the U.S. and other countries have not changed with the level of demand for cheap labor, thus forcing people illegally to immigrate. Illegal immigration then creates ideal conditions for organized criminal operations to form trafficking circles. With increased trade of foreign goods to rural areas, import competition in the rural markets has also forced people in poor areas to migrate to industrialized economies for better livelihoods. Their desperate positions often make them subject to exploitation and trafficking into different forms of forced labor to support that economy. Lastly, the technological <b>advances</b> <b>that</b> go hand in hand with globalization have facilitated the ease with which organized crime circles may conduct trafficking operations.|$|E
