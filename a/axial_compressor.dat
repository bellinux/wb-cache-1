5|$|In 1944, Republic Aviation's chief designer, Alexander Kartveli, {{began working}} on a turbojet-powered {{replacement}} for the P-47 Thunderbolt piston-engined fighter. The initial attempts to redesign the P-47 to accommodate a jet engine proved futile due to the large cross-section of the early centrifugal compressor turbojets. Instead, Kartveli and his team designed a new aircraft with a streamlined fuselage largely occupied by an <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> turbojet engine and fuel stored in rather thick unswept wings.|$|E
5|$|After his {{appointment}} as project director {{for a new}} indigenous fighter program, Tank adapted the basic Ta 183 airframe for the Nene II engine, substantially resulting in a new design that bore only a passing resemblance to its forebear. The Nene was larger, heavier and {{more powerful than the}} Heinkel HeS 011 turbojet that had been planned for use in the Ta 183, and therefore required a new, redesigned fuselage with a larger cross-section primarily due to the Nene's centrifugal rather than the HeS 011's <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> design.|$|E
5|$|Exhaust gas {{temperature}} margin erodes with usage, {{one or two}} performance restoration shop visits, costing $0.3-$0.6m for a -5 series, can be performed before taking the engine off wing, which can restore 60% to 80% of the original margin; after that, the life limited parts must be replaced, after 20,000 cycles for the hot section ($0.5m), 25,000 for the <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> and 30,000 for the fan and booster ($0.5m-$0.7m) for a recent CFM56 : the whole engine parts cost more than $3m, $3.5 to $4m with the shop work-hours, around $150 per cycle.|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 85 - 92 The {{rerating}} {{possibilities of}} compressors are discussed. Starting from the characteristic equations for design purposes, the relevant design parameters are specified. Concerning the rerating of <b>axial</b> <b>compressors,</b> methods are suggested for the rerating of <b>axial</b> <b>compressors</b> and for centrifugal compressors. Examples of revamped compressors are presented...|$|R
25|$|For all {{of these}} reasons, <b>axial</b> <b>compressors</b> on modern jet engines are {{considerably}} more complex than those on earlier designs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Axial</b> <b>compressors</b> {{are used}} in medium- to large-thrust gas turbine engines, because the {{alternative}} centrifugal units would be too heavy and too large in the cross-sectional area. At smaller sizes, the axial blading {{at the rear of}} the compressor loses its robustness and is difficult to manufacture accurately. Consequently, manufacturers tend to replace the rear stages with a centrifugal unit. The compression system is then said to be axial-centrifugal. In case of power generation, <b>axial</b> <b>compressors</b> {{are used in}} turbines which have capacity to generate more than 5 MW.|$|R

25|$|The T38 started {{life with}} a 19-stage <b>axial</b> <b>compressor,</b> eight can type {{combustion}} chambers, a 4-stage turbine driving the compressor and the extension shaft to the reduction gearbox.|$|E
25|$|The twin-spool J52 {{employs a}} split 12-stage <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> {{consisting}} of a five-stage low pressure unit and a seven-stage high pressure unit. Behind the compressor is a nine-unit can-annular combustion chamber and a two-stage split turbine.|$|E
25|$|Centrifugal {{compressors}} are impractical, {{compared to}} <b>axial</b> <b>compressors,</b> {{for use in}} large gas turbine engines propelling large aircraft, due to the resulting weight and stress, and to the frontal area presented by the diffuser.|$|R
40|$|This talk {{provides}} {{a description of}} several types of transition encountered in turbomachines. It is based largely on personal experience of the detection of transition in turbomachines. Examples are taken from <b>axial</b> <b>compressors,</b> <b>axial</b> turbines and radial turbines. The illustrations are concerned with transition in steady and unsteady boundary layers that develop {{under the influence of}} two-dimensional and three-dimensional flow fields...|$|R
25|$|<b>Axial</b> <b>compressors</b> {{can have}} high efficiencies; around 90% {{polytropic}} at their design conditions. However, {{they are relatively}} expensive, requiring {{a large number of}} components, tight tolerances and high quality materials. Axial-flow compressors are used in medium to large gas turbine engines, natural gas pumping stations, and some chemical plants.|$|R
25|$|The {{most recent}} {{variant of the}} J402 is the J402-CA-100, {{developed}} for the AGM-158 JASSM cruise missile. This derivative, like the -700, {{is based on the}} original -400 variant. The primary changes are an aerodynamically refined <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> and turbine section, resulting in a more fuel efficient engine at the same thrust levels as the -400.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} variant, the J402-CA-702, {{was developed}} internally by the company. This variant added an additional <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> stage (bringing the total to two axial stages), which increased the engine length by only 4 in (10cm), yet increased the thrust to 970lbf (4.3kN). The engine was later selected {{to power the}} MQM-107D, an improved version of the target drone. The addition of additional compressor stage increased the pressure ratio and overall airflow through the engine, and necessitated {{the development of a}} new turbine section. Teledyne designed and tested the new two stage <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> early in the J402's life (mid 1970s), but did not work on the new turbine (and subsequently the -702 variant of the engine) until nearly a decade later in the mid-1980s. The resulting engine was 45% more power than the -400/-700 variants, yet also had a 24% lower thrust specific fuel consumption (SFC).|$|E
25|$|Closing the {{variable}} stators progressively, as compressor speed falls, reduces {{the slope of}} the surge (or stall) line on the operating characteristic (or map), improving the surge margin of the installed unit. By incorporating variable stators in the first five stages, General Electric Aircraft Engines has developed a ten-stage <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> capable of operating at a 23:1 design pressure ratio.|$|E
5000|$|Dynamic {{displacement}} {{air compressors}} include centrifugal <b>compressors</b> and <b>axial</b> <b>compressors.</b> In these types, a rotating component imparts its kinetic {{energy to the}} air which is eventually converted into pressure energy.

40|$|General methodologies are {{proposed}} in this two-part paper that further phenomeno-logical understanding of compressible stall inception and aeromechanical control of high-speed <b>axial</b> <b>compressors</b> and engine performance. Developed in Part I are strat-egies for passive stabilization of compressible rotating stall, using tailored structural design and aeromechanical feedback control, implemented in certain classes of high-speed <b>axial</b> <b>compressors</b> used in research laboratories and by industry.

25|$|The key {{component}} {{that makes a}} compressor centrifugal is the centrifugal impeller, Figure 0.1, which contains a rotating set of vanes (or blades) that gradually raises {{the energy of the}} working gas. This is identical to an <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> with the exception that the gases can reach higher velocities and energy levels through the impeller's increasing radius. In many modern high-efficiency centrifugal compressors the gas exiting the impeller is traveling near the speed of sound.|$|E
25|$|Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{are often}} used in small gas turbine engines like APUs (auxiliary power units) and smaller aircraft gas turbines. A significant {{reason for this is}} that with current technology, the equivalent flow <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> will be less efficient due primarily to a combination of rotor and variable stator tip-clearance losses. Further, they offer the advantages of simplicity of manufacturing and relatively low cost. This is due to requiring fewer stages to achieve the same pressure rise.|$|E
25|$|This initial {{version of}} the CF6 has a {{single-stage}} fan with one core booster stage, driven by a 5-stage LP (low pressure) turbine, turbocharging a 16-stage HP (high pressure) <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> driven by a 2-stage HP turbine; the combustor is annular; separate exhaust nozzles are used for the fan and core airflows. The 86.4-in (2.19-m) diameter fan generates an airflow of 1,300lb/s (590kg/s), resulting in a relatively high bypass ratio of 5.72. The overall pressure ratio of the compression system is 24.3. At maximum take-off power, the engine develops a static thrust of 41,500lb (185.05kN).|$|E
40|$|Tutorialpg. 173 - 182 <b>Axial</b> air <b>compressors</b> {{have seen}} {{increased}} service in various applications over the years, {{mainly because of}} the <b>axial</b> <b>compressor's</b> high operating efficiency, which can be 85 to 90 plus percent. The design of the aerodynamic components, however, makes the machine very sensitive to fouling. This can reduce operating efficiency by 10 points or more, reducing the compressor output and adding to the plant utility load. It is advantageous to monitor compressor performance on a regular basis, and to clean the machine and/or perform other maintenance when calculations indicate the need is economically justified...|$|R

25|$|<b>Axial</b> <b>compressors,</b> {{particularly}} near {{design conditions}} are, on the whole, amenable to analytical treatment, and usually a good estimate {{of their performance}} can be made before they are run.

25|$|Any type of pump {{that can}} deliver the {{required}} pressure difference and flow volume can be used. Most often used is the dynamic-compression centrifugal type compressor, which {{is familiar to}} most as being used in vacuum cleaners and turbochargers, but multistaged axial-flow compressor types, {{similar to those used}} in most jet engines, could work as well, although there would be little need for the added cost and complexities involved, as they typically don't require such a high flow rate as a jet engine, nor are they limited by the aerodynamic drag considerations which makes a narrow-diameter <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> more effective in jet engines than a centrifugal compressor of equal air flow. Positive displacement types such as piston compressors, or rotary types such as a Roots blower could also be used with suitable provisions for damping the pulsations in the air flow (however, other rotary types such as twin screw compressors are capable of providing a steady supply of compressed fluid). The pressure ratio of a single fan blade is too low and cannot be used.|$|E
500|$|In 1946, the British Air Ministry issued Specification F.43/46, {{which sought}} a daytime jet-powered {{interceptor}} aircraft. Camm promptly prepared a new {{design for a}} swept-winged fighter that would be powered by the upcoming Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet. The Avon's major advantage over the earlier Nene engine, as used in the earlier Sea Hawk, was adoption of the <b>axial</b> <b>compressor,</b> which allowed for a much smaller engine diameter and provided greater thrust; this single engine gave roughly the same power as the two Rolls-Royce Derwents of the Gloster Meteors, a fighter aircraft that would {{be replaced by the}} envisioned new aircraft. In March1948, the Air Ministry issued a revised Specification F.3/48, which demanded a speed of 629mph (1,010km/h) at 45,000ft (13,700m) and a high rate of climb, while carrying an armament of four [...] or two 30mm (1.18in) cannon (rather than the large-calibre gun demanded by earlier specifications). Initially fitted with a single air intake in the nose and a T-tail, the project rapidly evolved into the more familiar Hunter shape. The intakes were moved to the wing roots to make room for weapons and radar in the nose, and a more conventional tail arrangement was devised as a result of stability concerns.|$|E
500|$|Honda {{started to}} {{introduce}} their {{third and final}} round of upgrades ahead of the , focusing on {{the internal combustion engine}} and associated exhaust parts with the aim of improving the efficiency of the MGU-H and gradually introducing new parts over the next three rounds. The engine ancillaries were reconfigured to allow for better packaging within the chassis, while the <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> was replaced with a more conventional—albeit smaller—design. The exhaust wastegate was also updated ahead of planned development for 2016, with the exhaust outlets reconfigured to improve the engine's power curve. Honda chose to focus on the internal combustion engine instead of directly addressing the problems with the MGU-H as they felt that the problems could not be adequately addressed with their remaining allowance for in-season development, and instead deferred development of the MGU-H {{until the end of the}} season when the restrictions on development would be lifted. The upgrades were given to Alonso, with Button scheduled to receive them two rounds later at the [...] The updates were received positively by Alonso, who pointed out that he had been setting lap times that were faster than those recorded by Lewis Hamilton during the opening phase of the race, and that the team had identified the potential to gain two and a half seconds per lap in 2016 through further refining of the engine and by adopting aerodynamic design elements used by other teams. Button was less optimistic, pointing out that the engine would struggle in Mexico as the high altitude of the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez—some [...] above sea level—would leave the turbine down on power given the low density of the air. Although the team's predictions of a difficult weekend were proven true after qualifying, they highlighted the deficit to the leading Mercedes through the less power-dependent sectors of the circuit as being consistently within three tenths of a second, the narrowest the margin had been over the course of the season.|$|E
