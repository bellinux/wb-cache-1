5|$|The next {{match was}} a No Disqualification match between Kane, who was {{accompanied}} by Lita, and Shawn Michaels. Kane would gain the early advantage as he suplexed Michaels through the announce table. Kane would continue to brawl with Michaels at ringside where he hit Michaels with the ringside steel steps, which resulted in Michaels bleeding. As Kane attempted to hit Michaels with a steel chair, Lita would interfere <b>and</b> <b>grab</b> <b>the</b> chair away from Kane. Kane then attempted a chokeslam, but Michaels would counter it with Sweet Chin Music, which gained a successful pinfall.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match was}} The Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff) against The World's Greatest Tag Team (Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas) in a Ladder {{match for the}} World Tag Team Championship. The goal is to climb a ladder and {{retrieve}} the title belts suspended above the ring. The Hardys had the advantage {{for most of the}} match, but as Jeff was climbing the ladder to try <b>and</b> <b>grab</b> <b>the</b> belts, Benjamin botched a springboard attempt. Benjamin kicked the ladder from underneath Jeff, however, to gain control. The Hardys regained the advantage by pushing the ladder as The World's Greatest Tag Team were climbing it, causing Benjamin to fall to the floor. Jeff Swanton bombed Haas as Matt climbed the ladder to get the belts and win.|$|E
5|$|Lavender {{created a}} {{controversy}} {{in a game}} on September23, when he was caught altering the baseball by rubbing it against an emery board that he had attached to his uniform's pant leg, an illegal act. At the time, the fine for such an infraction was a five-dollar fine. The Phillies players noticed that the pitcher was constantly scratching {{the side of his}} leg. They asked the umpire to search the pitcher. Lavender refused to be searched and ran into the outfield, and the umpire refused to chase Lavender. Eventually, a particularly fast Phillies player, Hans Lobert, was able to catch up with him <b>and</b> <b>grab</b> <b>the</b> offending item. As a result of this incident, AL president, Ban Johnson, decreed that any pitcher in his league caught using sandpaper to alter the baseball, would be suspended for 30days and fined $100. This rule became the forebearer of the rule banning other pitches as well, including the spitball. In his 37 games pitched in 1914, 28were as the starting pitcher. His win–loss record was 11–11, and he lowered his ERA down to 3.07in 214innings pitched.|$|E

500|$|While Seattle {{controlled}} {{the game for}} much of the first half, Columbus took the lead on a counterattack movement in the 24thminute. [...] The play developed on the right side when Hejduk made a low pass to Lenhart from a forward position. [...] Lenhart touched the ball to Kevin Burns for a low shot inside the far post for a goal.

500|$|Tigers {{are thought}} to be mainly nocturnal predators, but in areas where humans are {{typically}} absent, they have been observed via remote-controlled, hidden cameras, hunting in daylight. They generally hunt alone and ambush their prey as most other cats do, overpowering them from any angle, using their body size and strength to knock the prey off balance. Successful hunts usually require the tiger to almost simultaneously leap onto its quarry, knock it over, <b>and</b> <b>grab</b> <b>the</b> throat or nape with its teeth. Despite their large size, tigers can reach speeds of about [...] but only in short bursts; consequently, tigers must be close to their prey before they break cover. If the prey catches wind of the tiger's presence before this, the tiger usually abandons the hunt rather than chase prey or battle it head-on. Horizontal leaps of up to [...] have been reported, although leaps of around half this distance are more typical. One in 2 to 20 hunts, including stalking near potential prey, ends in a successful kill.|$|E

Donald succeeds and receives the Sphinx Tear, which is the key to open a temple in Egypt. Donald is able to solve the [...] "Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] using the note Goofy had given him, and obtains the Scepter of Ra before escaping in a mine cart. From there, he journeys to the South Pole, where he finds a key frozen in ice, and uses the Scepter of Ra to melt the ice <b>and</b> <b>grab</b> <b>the</b> key. The key unlocks the hold of a Viking ship, which contains an ancient diary with the secret to locating the treasure. The ship is haunted by ghosts, and the Viking captain sends Donald below decks to get rid of them. After defeating a skeletal Viking warrior, Donald returns to the deck, where the captain informs him that the diary is hidden in ice near the South Pole, and gives him an [...] "ancient Viking plunger" [...] that attaches to flying creatures. Donald then returns to the South Pole, hitching a ride on one of Pete's bird minions to reach the diary.|$|E

500|$|Super Mario 3D Land is a {{platform}} game {{that has been}} described by game designer Shigeru Miyamoto as a [...] "3D Mario that plays as a 2D Mario game". As such, Super Mario 3D Land combines the elements of traditional side-scrolling video game titles, such as linear-based levels, with those of the modern open world titles, such as moving Mario in three dimensions and performing a variety of actions. Similar to the older side-scrolling Mario games, the health system revolves around Mario shrinking upon taking damage from enemies or hazards, there is a dedicated [...] "Dash" [...] button as opposed to using analog input to determine travel speed, and damage as [...] "Small Mario" [...] results in losing a life. Mario has also learned two new moves: a barrel roll and a roll jump, the former of which can be used to break blocks in a similar manner to jumping at blocks from below or ground pounding, and the latter allowing Mario to cover much horizontal ground in one jump. Super Mario 3D Land utilizes a similar level objective to those games, in which the point of each level is to reach <b>and</b> <b>grab</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Goal Pole" [...] {{at the end of the}} level, with the time limit.|$|E

2500|$|The semi-diurnal {{activity}} of tomb bats {{has led to}} the evolution of relatively good eyesight, unlike most echolocating bats. Their vision is very similar to the eyesight found in that of Old-World bats. The presence of the dim-light (RH1) gene in both the tomb bats and Old-World bats suggests convergent evolution of this gene in a similar light-rich environment. The Mauritian tomb bat can detect movement from a distance away, which suggests that the bat's eyesight is superior to that of other insect-eating bats. This advanced eyesight plays a large role in finding a suitable roost for the day and detecting predators. The Mauritian tomb bat is, for the most part, a nocturnal hunter, though it does occasionally forage during the day. [...] They prefer to hunt in open spaces such as over an open field or body of water, so they can easily swoop down <b>and</b> <b>grab</b> <b>the</b> insects they feed on. The Mauritian tomb bat captures its prey and consumes it while in flight.|$|E

2500|$|The {{battle plan}} called for Kienmayer to clear Tellnitz village of French troops <b>and</b> <b>grab</b> <b>the</b> high ground {{to the west of}} the Goldbach stream. First, the Austrians {{encountered}} 300 French skirmishers on a vineyard-covered knoll at 8:00 am. Stout resistance forced Kienmayer to commit both battalions of the 2nd Szekler Grenz Infantry Regiment before the knoll fell. Utilizing the vineyards, ditches, and rough ground around Tellnitz, the 1,000 men of the 3rd Line Infantry Regiment fought all five Austrian infantry battalions to a standstill. At last, the Russian 7th Jägers charged in column and cleared the French from the village. By this time French reinforcements arrived on the scene and the 108th Line recaptured the village. However, the French carried their luck too far and a few squadrons of the numerous Austrian hussars charged. After losing several hundred casualties, including many prisoners, the French abandoned Tellnitz and retreated across the Goldbach. At 9:30 am, Buxhowden's Austro-Russians were finally able to deploy across the Goldbach. One historian writes, ...|$|E
