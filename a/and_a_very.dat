5|$|Beryllium oxide {{is useful}} for many {{applications}} that require the combined properties of an electrical insulator and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> high melting point. Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in high-power transistors in radio frequency transmitters for telecommunications. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel pellets. Beryllium compounds were used in fluorescent lighting tubes, but this use was discontinued because of the disease berylliosis which developed in the workers who were making the tubes.|$|E

5|$|By {{the evening}} of 25 September, the 1st Light Horse Brigade held the Amman railway station area, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade held the area to the south, while the 2nd Light Horse Brigade bivouaced on the western slope of Hill 3039. A {{squadron}} from the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment was sent to Madeba where they captured a number of prisoners <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> large amount of grain.

5|$|Considerable {{scholarship}} has been concentrated on researching {{the level of}} living standards during the Song dynasty. A recent study by economic historian Cheng Minsheng estimated the average income for lower-class laborers during the Song dynasty as 100 wen a day, about 5 times the estimated subsistence level of 20 wen a day <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> high level for preindustrial economies. Per capita consumption of grain and silk respectively was estimated by Cheng to be around 8 jin (about 400 g each) a day and 2 bolts a year, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Each {{chemical}} element {{has a unique}} atomic number (Z) representing the number of protons in its nucleus. Most elements have differing numbers of neutrons among different atoms, with these variants being referred to as isotopes. For example, carbon has three naturally occurring isotopes: all of its atoms have six protons and most have six neutrons as well, but about one per cent have seven neutrons, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> small fraction have eight neutrons. Isotopes are never separated in the periodic table; they are always grouped together under a single element. Elements with no stable isotopes have the atomic masses of their most stable isotopes, where such masses are shown, listed in parentheses.|$|E

5|$|In nature, uranium {{is found}} as uranium-238 (99.2739–99.2752%), {{uranium-235}} (0.7198–0.7202%), <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{small amount of}} uranium-234 (0.0050–0.0059%). Uranium decays slowly by emitting an alpha particle. The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 billion years and that of uranium-235 is 704 million years, making them useful in dating {{the age of the}} Earth.|$|E
5|$|Iridium's modulus of {{elasticity}} is {{the second-highest}} among the metals, only being surpassed by osmium. This, together with a high shear modulus <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> low figure for Poisson's ratio (the relationship of longitudinal to lateral strain), indicate {{the high degree of}} stiffness and resistance to deformation that have rendered its fabrication into useful components a matter of great difficulty. Despite these limitations and iridium's high cost, a number of applications have developed where mechanical strength is an essential factor in some of the extremely severe conditions encountered in modern technology.|$|E
5|$|Iron {{shows the}} {{characteristic}} chemical {{properties of the}} transition metals, namely the ability to form variable oxidation states differing by steps of one <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> large coordination and organometallic chemistry: indeed, it was the discovery of an iron compound, ferrocene, that revolutionalized the latter field in the 1950s. Iron is sometimes considered as a prototype for the entire block of transition metals, due to its abundance and the immense role it has played in the technological progress of humanity. Its 26 electrons are arranged in the configuration 3d64s2, of which the 3d and 4s electrons are relatively close in energy, and thus it can lose a variable number of electrons {{and there is no}} clear point where further ionization becomes unprofitable.|$|E

5|$|Males display {{during the}} {{breeding}} season at a lek {{in a traditional}} open grassy arena. The ruff {{is one of the}} few lekking species in which the display is primarily directed at other males rather than to the females, and it is among the small percentage of birds in which the males have well-marked and inherited variations in plumage and mating behaviour. There are three male forms: the typical territorial males, satellite males which have a white neck ruff, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> rare variant with female-like plumage. The behaviour and appearance for an individual male remain constant through its adult life, and are determined by its genes (see §Biology of variation among males).|$|E
5|$|Native Americans have {{inhabited}} the Table Rocks area {{for at least}} 15,000 years before European-American settlement. Starting in the mid-19th century during a gold rush, the settlers forced the Takelma tribe away from the Table Rocks and into reservations. The surrounding area was quickly developed. The Table Rock post office was established in 1872, an airstrip was built atop Lower Table Rock in 1948, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> high frequency omni-directional range (VOR) aviation tower was constructed on Upper Table Rock in the 1960s.

5|$|The 98%-ish {{complete}} beta and {{an earlier}} version were eventually leaked and made playable.
