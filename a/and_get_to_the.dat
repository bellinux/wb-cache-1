The party reluctantly decide the only way past the Misty Mountains is to go under them, via the goblin mines of Moria. They arrive at the Doors of Durin, but are attacked by the Watcher. After slaying the creature, they continue into Moria. Inside, Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) is horrified to learn that his cousin Balin is dead. In the Chamber of Mazarbul, the Fellowship finds Balin's tomb and a record of how the dwarves lost the mine to the goblins. The fellowship is then attacked by a hoard of goblins and a cave troll.

25|$|Standing at 6 feet 5 {{inches tall}} (1.96 m) and {{weighing}} 220 pounds (100kg), Harden plays mostly at the shooting guard position. With season averages of over 26 {{points per game}} since the 2012–13 season, Harden {{is considered one of}} the most versatile and dangerous scorers in the NBA. He possesses a wide array of offensive moves; two of the most prominent among them being his Euro step and his step-back jumper. He has also gained notoriety for his ability to exploit league rules in order to more efficiently draw fouls <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> free throw line, from which he is a career 84.9% shooter. He has led the NBA in free throw attempts and makes every year since the 2014–15 season. Though primarily a scorer, he is also known for his playmaking ability, orchestrating the Rockets' offense with his elevated assist numbers. During the early portion of the 2016–17 season, Rockets head coach Mike D'Antoni played Harden at point guard, which resulted in him averaging over 10 assists per game for the first time in his career.|$|E
25|$|The Bears got {{the early}} leap on the Sooners. Running back Brandon Whitaker {{scored on a}} 46yard {{touchdown}} run halfway through the first quarter to put the Bears up 7–0. The Sooners responded on their next possession. The Sooners started on their own 28yard line and capped the drive off with a 25yard touchdown run from DeMarco Murray. Baylor went three and out on their next possession and gave the ball back to Oklahoma on the Oklahoma 49yard line. The Sooners only needed one play to score again and that came on a 51yard touchdown pass from Sam Bradford to Malcolm Kelly. On their next drive, Baylor drove to Oklahoma's 21yard line, was forced {{to settle for a}} field goal, then missed. On the next possession, Bradford connected with tight end Jermaine Gresham for a 43yard pass that set up a oneyard touchdown run for Murray. Late in the 2nd quarter, Baylor quarterback Blake Szymanski threw a 75yard touchdown pass to Thomas White to bring the score to 21–14. On the ensuing kickoff, returner Murray let the ball roll past him before he picked it up near the 10yard line. He managed to shed tacklers <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outside and to return the kickoff 91yards for a touchdown and bring the score to 28–14 before going into halftime.|$|E

500|$|With {{the loss}} of the ship the transcontinental plans were abandoned, and the focus shifted to that of survival. [...] Shackleton's {{intention}} now was to march the crew westward, to one or other of several possible destinations. His first thought was for Paulet Island, where he knew there was a hut containing a substantial food depot, because he had ordered it 12years earlier while organising relief for Otto Nordenskiöld’s stranded Swedish expedition. Other possibilities were Snow Hill Island, which had been Nordenskiöld’s winter quarters and which was believed to contain a stock of emergency supplies, [...] or Robertson Island. Shackleton believed that from one of these islands {{they would be able to}} reach and cross Graham Land, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> whaling outposts in Wilhelmina Bay. He calculated that on the day Endurance [...] was abandoned they were 346 miles from Paulet Island. Worsley calculated the distance to Snow Hill Island to be , with a further [...] to Wilhelmina Bay. He believed the march was too risky; they should wait until the ice carried them to open water, and then escape in the boats. Shackleton overruled him.|$|E

Under World Baseball Classic rules any pitcher who throws over 50 pitches cannot pitch again for four days, therefore by pulling Marquis before reaching this limit, enabled Israel to utilize Marquis again in the tournament. Marquis again started for {{the final game of}} the qualifier and threw 43 pitches over four perfect innings, while recording 5 strikeouts.

2500|$|Anthony {{plays the}} small forward {{position}} {{though he is}} also capable of playing power forward. His scoring prowess is considered his best asset with his ability to take over any game on the offensive end; he shares the NBA record for second most points scored in one quarter with 33, and holds the New York Knicks single-game franchise scoring record with 62. On offense, Anthony is recognized for being a prolific scorer {{with a variety of}} crafty offensive moves. Listed at 6ft 8in (2.03m) and 235pounds (107kg), he has strength and quickness to be an immediate and consistent scoring threat in the post. He also likes creating space from his defenders which allows him to step into his jump shot or put the ball on the floor and drive to the basket <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> free throw line. Anthony is often known for being one of the premier clutch performers in the NBA; during the 2005–06 season, Anthony made five game-winning shots in the last five seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime. Dave McMenamin, a staff writer for ESPN, wrote, [...] "If you were going to choose one player to challenge Bryant for his title of Mr. Clutch, {{it would have to be}} Anthony." [...] Despite being a prolific scorer, he has been criticized for his defense and has never been named to the NBA All-Defensive Team.|$|E
2500|$|Later, Vanita {{condenses}} {{the ideas}} {{in her book}} into an article, [...] "Same-sex Weddings, Hindu Traditions and Modern India". Here, she summarizes specific cases in which women specifically committed joint-suicides, were married and separated, or successfully married. She points out three different [...] "forces that have helped female couples". These are: the law courts, the media, and some Hindu authorities (such as the swamis mentioned earlier in this article) from her book. [...] When female couples can stay together under the social pressures <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> courts, the courts generally hold up their decisions, holding {{to the fact that}} the women are consenting adults. While this does not necessarily stop the harassment, it does lend the couple further legitimacy under the laws. In addition, the more successful same-sex marriages of women are those in which the women are financially independent. If they have social support from their families and community—for the most part—then they may be able to live in peace together. The media may also play an important role in same-sex marriages. In drawing attention to their marriages, women who do not necessarily know about LGBT rights groups may be contacted and supported by those groups after media attention. However, the flip side of this is that the anti-LGBT groups also may reach out against their marriage.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his regular}} season debut, Luck threw his first career {{interception}} to Chicago Bears cornerback Tim Jennings. He would later throw his first career {{touchdown pass to}} Donnie Avery. Ultimately, Luck completed 23 of 45 passes for 309 yards, a touchdown, and three interceptions, as the Colts lost 41–21. The next week against the Minnesota Vikings, Luck threw for 224 {{yards and two touchdowns}} with no interceptions. Additionally, Luck got his first career win in the NFL and did this by completing his first game-winning drive of his professional career. Before a week 5 showdown with the Green Bay Packers and reigning MVP Aaron Rodgers, Colts head coach Chuck Pagano was diagnosed with leukemia and had to take a leave of absence. Rallying the team for their coach (a movement that become known as [...] "CHUCKSTRONG") Luck completed his second career game-winning drive by throwing a touchdown to Reggie Wayne with 35 seconds left to pull off the stunning upset. Luck's then career-best 362-yard passing effort set a new rookie QB mark in Colts franchise history. The 18-point comeback also was the best by a rookie quarterback since Matthew Stafford, the first pick in the 2009 NFL Draft, led a 21-point rally for the Lions vs. the Browns in 2009. Luck completed 31 of 55 for 362 yards and three total touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing). Luck won his first career road and overtime game during a week 8 game against the division rival Tennessee Titans. A touchdown pass to running back Vick Ballard on the first drive of overtime gave the Colts a 19–13 victory. In a week 9 win against the Miami Dolphins, Luck threw for 433 yards, a new record for most yards in a game by a rookie QB (surpassing Cam Newton's 432 against the Green Bay Packers in 2011). Luck later sent his jersey from the Dolphins game to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Through Week 9, Luck had thrown for the same number of yards as his predecessor, Peyton Manning. In Week 13 against the Detroit Lions, Luck and the Colts were trailing 33–21 with 2:39 left. After throwing a touchdown to fellow rookie LaVon Brazill, Luck and the Colts were able to get the ball back <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lions' 14-yard line, facing a 4th down with [...] :04 left. Luck then threw a screen pass to Donnie Avery who got free and ran in for the winning score, marking a big moment in Luck's early career. The win gave Luck his eighth on the season – the most wins by a rookie quarterback drafted first overall in NFL history, as well as his fifth game-winning drive on the season, tying Vince Young and Ben Roethlisberger for the most by a rookie quarterback. On December 23, 2012, Luck broke the record for most passing yards in a season by a rookie against the Kansas City Chiefs, throwing 205 to bring his season total to 4,183. Cam Newton held the previous record with 4,051 yards.|$|E
