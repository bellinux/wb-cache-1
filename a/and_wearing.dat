40|$|The {{friction}} <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> {{properties of}} 201 HT aluminum alloys {{and the corresponding}} competitive coupons were tested on an electrohydraulic servo face friction <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> testing machine (MM-U 10 G).

The results demonstrated that: (1) the best competitive material of friction <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> performance of the 201 HT was the 201 HTC. (2) the 201 HTC modified by carbon following the initial mill for oil storage of the micro-groove to be produced, increased the corresponding lubrication performance reduced the friction coefficient <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> rate effectively. (3) the 201 HT- 201 HTC could obtain both better friction <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> mainly due to the initial process of grinding following the 201 HT plastic deformation occurred in the surface {{and the formation of}} a series of re-melting welding points, whereas the 201 HT material hardness would be similar to the 201 HTC material hardness, which led into the competitive material friction <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> performance improvement...|$|R

5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden effigy with {{a copper}} crown {{was made for}} the funeral; {{this is the first}} known use of a funeral effigy in England, and was probably necessary because of the condition of the King's body, which had been dead for three months.

His tomb includes a very early example of an English alabaster effigy, with a tomb-chest and a canopy made of oolite and Purbeck stone. Edward was buried in the shirt, coif and gloves from his coronation, and his effigy depicts him as king, holding a sceptre and orb, <b>and</b> <b>wearing</b> a strawberry-leaf crown. The effigy features a pronounced lower lip, and may be a close likeness of Edward.|$|E
