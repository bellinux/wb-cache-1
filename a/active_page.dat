40|$|Active Pages is a page-based {{model of}} {{intelligent}} memory {{specifically designed to}} support virtualized hardware resources. Previous work has shown substantial performance benefits from off-loading data-intensive tasks to a memory system that implements Active Pages. With a simple VLIW processor embedded near each page on DRAM, <b>Active</b> <b>Page</b> memory systems achieve up to 1000 X speedups over conventional memory systems [1]. In this study, we examine <b>Active</b> <b>Page</b> memories that share, or multiplex, embedded VLIW processors across multiple physical Active Pages.

We find that hardware costs of computational logic can be reduced from 31 % of DRAM chip area to 12 %, through multiplexing, without significant loss in performance. Furthermore, manufacturing defects that disable up to 50 % of the page processors can be tolerated through efficient resource allocation and associative multiplexing. 1 Intro [...] ...|$|E

We find that simple streaming media applications execute equally well on both of these processor types. However, irregular applications execute better on VLIW processors, whereas the compact instruction format representation of a vector processor can more efficiently utilize the available processor resources for certain types of applications. 1 Introduction As the performance gap between processor and memory grows, it becomes increasingly expensive for a centralized mic [...] ...|$|E

The subject of social interaction in social media is an interesting field to study due to its vast range, the largely amount of people involved and it is of interest {{to see how the}} company and customers interact. The purpose of the essay was to study the interaction between the company and visitors. The statement of the problem is divided into four questions which is processing a deeper analysis of how the company page is used. What reasons the company might {{have to be in the}} social network and reasons for visitors to interact on the company page and lastly how the attitude from the company was perceived. Previous research used for this study has been four articles on the subject of social media to see how the research had taken place. Chosen methods for the study were methods of mapping of the company page in the network, a critical discourse analysis on chosen elements from the mapping and a complementary questionnaire sent out to the visitors in the social network. Through these we received insight in the fact that the pages were used mostly for information and customer-to-customer interaction and so also expression of views. The given conclusions of the study were that it creates an imagined interaction with the company, whilst the real interaction is between the customers under the auspices of the company. We found that the most important factor was to have the opportunity to be able to interact, even though the shown views were played with the assertion of one’s identity.

The other realization is that static aggregation of resources for improved scheduling is inadequate in wide-area computing environments because the needs of users and jobs change with both, location and time.
