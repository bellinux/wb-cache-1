5|$|From the {{renovation}} in 1980 until 1985 the non-profit 5th Avenue Theatre successfully operated as {{a venue for}} touring Broadway shows. As the United States went through <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> <b>downturn</b> from 1985 to 1989 there was a shortage of touring shows for venues like the 5th. Consequently, many of the country's Broadway houses went unused for extended periods of time. However, the 5th remained open during these years with a reduced staff and was used for community events and local promoters.|$|E
5|$|The Great Depression in Canada {{during the}} early 1930s saw <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> <b>downturn,</b> leading to {{hardship}} across the country. In response to the downturn, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state (as pioneered by Tommy Douglas) in the 1940s and 1950s. On the advice of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, war with Germany was declared effective September 10, 1939, by King George VI, seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada's independence.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to reduced}} demand for coal, {{resulting}} from <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> <b>downturn,</b> many of CF's coal mines never reopened and many men {{were thrown out}} of work. The union was forced to discontinue strike benefits in February 1915. There was destitution in the coal fields. With the help of funds from the Rockefeller Foundation, relief programs were organized by the Colorado Committee on Unemployment and Relief. A state agency created by Governor Carlson, offered work to unemployed miners building roads and doing other useful projects.|$|E

5|$|Like other Rust Belt cities, Utica had <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> <b>downturn</b> {{beginning}} in the mid-20thcentury. The downturn consisted of industrial decline due to globalization and the closure of textile mills, population loss caused by the relocation of jobs and businesses to suburbs and to Syracuse, and poverty associated with socioeconomic stress and a decreased tax base. With its low cost of living, the city has become a melting pot for refugees from war-torn countries around the world, encouraging growth for its colleges and universities, cultural institutions and economy.|$|E
5|$|The {{first years}} of the 14th century were marked by famines, {{culminating}} in the Great Famine of 1315–17. The causes of the Great Famine included the slow transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age, which left the population vulnerable when bad weather caused crop failures. The years 1313–14 and 1317–21 were excessively rainy throughout Europe, resulting in widespread crop failures. The climate change—which resulted in a declining average annual temperature for Europe during the 14th century—was accompanied by <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> <b>downturn.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Lima, {{the capital of}} Peru, began with its {{foundation}} by Francisco Pizarro on January 18, 1535. The city was established on {{the valley of the}} Rímac River in an area populated by the Ichma polity. It became the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru and site of a Real Audiencia in 1543. In the 17th century, the city prospered as the center of an extensive trade network despite damage from earthquakes and the threat of pirates. However, prosperity came to an end in the 18th century due to <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> <b>downturn</b> and the Bourbon Reforms.|$|E
5|$|For a {{widespread}} currency war to occur {{a large proportion}} of significant economies must wish to devalue their currencies at once. This has so far only happened during <b>a</b> global <b>economic</b> <b>downturn.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After <b>a</b> {{profound}} <b>economic</b> <b>downturn</b> {{beginning in}} 2007 and lasting {{for the next}} few years, the publishing industry slumped significantly. Nelson commented in 2008 how layoffs and salary freezes were [...] "sobering".|$|R

5|$|<b>An</b> <b>economic</b> <b>downturn</b> was {{beginning}} in Canada by 1958. Because {{of tax cuts}} instituted the previous year, the budget presented by the government predicted a small deficit for 1957–58, and a large one, $648million, for the following year. Minister of Finance Fleming and Bank of Canada Governor James Coyne proposed that the wartime Victory Bond issue, which constituted two-thirds of the national debt and which was due to be redeemed by 1967, be refinanced to a longer term. After considerable indecision on Diefenbaker's part, a nationwide campaign took place, and 90% of the bonds were converted. However, this transaction led {{to an increase in}} the money supply, which in future years would hamper the government's efforts to respond to unemployment.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 Chico left Sidley & Austin {{to become}} a senior partner of Altheimer & Gray. Oscar D’Angelo, a friend of Richard M. Daley and a former Altheimer partner, {{suggested}} to the firm’s managing partner that the firm hire Chico. In 2000, just four years later, at age 44, Chico became chairman of Altheimer. In 2002, the firm gave {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars to Governor Rod Blagojevich and Attorney General Lisa Madigan's campaigns. In 2003, while Chico was chairman and simultaneously running for the US Senate, Altheimer became insolvent and dissolved. Some partners blamed the bankruptcy on poor management by Chico, while an attorney who sat on two financial committees blamed <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> <b>downturn.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{community}} of Dartmouth {{lies on the}} east shore of Halifax Harbour, while Halifax is on the west shore. Halifax and Dartmouth had thrived during times of war; the harbour {{was one of the}} British Royal Navy's most important bases in North America, a centre for wartime trade, and a home to privateers who harried the British Empire's enemies during the American Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812. The completion of the Intercolonial Railway and its Deep Water Terminal in 1880 allowed for increased steamship trade and led to accelerated development of the port area, but Halifax faced <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> <b>downturn</b> after the British garrison left the city in late 1905 and early 1906.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> major <b>economic</b> <b>downturn</b> in 1906 {{ended the}} {{expansion}} {{from the late}} 1890s. This {{was followed by the}} Panic of 1907. The Panic of 1907 was a factor in the establishment of the Federal Reserve Bank in 1913.|$|R
50|$|An {{interesting}} {{history is}} found {{in the fact that the}} town had been divided for four centuries between two lords, and this division was only completed in 1849. Today, the municipality is affected by <b>a</b> deep <b>economic</b> <b>downturn</b> of agricultural production.|$|R
50|$|Disero {{advocated}} significant {{budget cuts}} for Toronto in 1993, {{to counteract the}} effects of <b>a</b> serious <b>economic</b> <b>downturn</b> across the country. She said that the city needed to impose significant wage cuts, or introduce unpaid leave days, {{in order to remain}} solvent.|$|R
5|$|The {{height of}} the East Terrace was greatly reduced and a roof was erected in the mid-1980s. This work reduced the {{capacity}} to 27,000. Hibs {{was taken over by}} a consortium led by David Duff in 1987. The new regime spent approximately £1 million on executive boxes and refurbishments, but their policy of diversifying the business into property and public houses crippled the club financially when there was <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> <b>downturn</b> in the late 1980s. Hearts chairman Wallace Mercer attempted a takeover of Hibs in June 1990, with the intention of merging the two major Edinburgh football clubs. The Hibs fans protested against this and Mercer was prevented from gaining the 75% shareholding that was needed to close Hibs.|$|E
5|$|In January 1937, Voorhis's first {{legislative}} initiative was {{to propose a}} dramatic increase in spending for the Works Progress Administration in order to increase employment. While this effort was unsuccessful, Congress, faced with <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> <b>downturn</b> the following year, increased WPA spending beyond the level which Voorhis had sought. While the 75th Congress had in excess of 300Democrats, many of them were conservative, and Voorhis emerged as a leader of a progressive caucus of some 50 representatives. Voorhis advocated the purchase by the Federal Government of the stock in the Federal Reserve Banks, which was held by the member banks, as a way of financing government expenditures and briefly got President Roosevelt to support the measure until the President's advisers caused Roosevelt to change his mind. Voorhis later allied with future House Banking Committee chairman Wright Patman to force Federal Reserve Banks to pay most of the interest they earned on federal securities to the U.S. Government, rather than to the bank stockholders.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Grunwald, First Battle of Tannenberg or Battle of Žalgiris, {{was fought}} on 15 July 1410 during the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War. The {{alliance}} of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, led respectively by King Władysław II Jagiełło (Jogaila) and Grand Duke Vytautas, decisively defeated the German–Prussian Teutonic Knights, led by Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen. Most of the Teutonic Knights' leadership {{were killed or}} taken prisoner. Although defeated, the Teutonic Knights withstood the siege of their fortress in Marienburg (Malbork) and suffered minimal territorial losses at the Peace of Thorn (1411) (Toruń), with other territorial disputes continuing until the Peace of Melno in 1422. The knights, however, would never recover their former power, and the financial burden of war reparations caused internal conflicts and <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> <b>downturn</b> in the lands under their control. The battle shifted {{the balance of power}} in Central and Eastern Europe and marked the rise of the Polish–Lithuanian union as the dominant political and military force in the region.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, on {{the heels}} of the Second Intifada and <b>a</b> sharp <b>economic</b> <b>downturn</b> in Israel, the US {{provided}} Israel with $9 billion in conditional loan guarantees made available through 2011 and negotiated each year at the US-Israel Joint Economic Development Group.|$|R
50|$|Suzuki and Subaru {{pulled out}} of the WRC {{at the end of the}} 2008 championship, both citing the <b>economic</b> <b>downturn</b> then {{affecting}} the automotive industry for their withdrawal.

25|$|There {{had been}} a {{proposal}} by the Davison brothers of Ballymena to build a railway between Belfast and Ballymena in 1836 but this came to nothing due, firstly, to the inability to identify a suitable route out of Belfast that did not include excessive gradients and, secondly, <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> <b>downturn.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the 16th century, in {{response}} to an economic boom, the Hakka moved into hilly areas to mine for zinc and lead, and also moved into the coastal plains to cultivate cash crops. After <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> <b>downturn,</b> many of these ventures failed and many people had to turn to pillaging to make ends meet.|$|E
25|$|In 1892, Indiana made {{a voyage}} to Czarist Russia with a cargo of grain destined for famine relief. The relief voyage {{was a result}} of the {{sympathetic}} relationship that had built up between Russia and Philadelphia via warship contracts awarded by the Russian Navy to the shipyard of William Cramp & Sons, which had kept the Philadelphian waterfront busy during <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> <b>downturn.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> the <b>economic</b> <b>downturn</b> put {{pressure}} on the US auto market, combined with the high fuel prices of the mid-2008, vehicle sales tumbled in late 2008 to the extent that Toyota shut down production at TMMTX for a three-month period to reduce inventory of the Tundra pickup.|$|R
