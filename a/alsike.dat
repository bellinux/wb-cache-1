5|$|The genus Mythicomyces was {{circumscribed}} in 1986 by mycologists Scott Redhead and Alexander H. Smith {{to contain the}} species originally named Agaricus corneipes by Elias Magnus Fries in 1861. Fries described the species from collections made in a fir forest near <b>Alsike,</b> Sweden; it was subsequently recorded in North America (northwestern USA) by Andrew Price Morgan in 1907, and several times by Smith. When listing the synonyms of the species, Redhead and Smith cited the publication year of Fries's work as 1863 instead of the correct 1861, which rendered their new combination invalid {{according to the rules}} of International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, although the generic name was valid. The binomial was subsequently published validly in 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Despite failing at {{his initial}} farming attempt, Semon {{continued}} {{to look for a}} location to establish a farming operation. [...] In 1910, Semon purchased a [...] farm in southern Klamath County, Oregon. [...] He initially planted apple trees and berries, but soon began growing potatoes. [...] Semon was widely known for his innovative farmer practices. [...] He introduced the Netted Gem variety of potato to the county. [...] This new variety quickly became an important crop in the Klamath Basin. [...] He was also the first farmer in the Klamath Basin to harvest <b>alsike</b> clover.|$|E
60|$|Earlier in {{the season}} there had been {{drenching}} thunder showers, and beyond the grain the flax spread in sheets of delicate blue that broke off {{on the verge of}} the brown-headed timothy. Still farther back lay the green of <b>alsike</b> and alfalfa, for the band of red and white cattle that roamed about the bluffs; but while the fodder crop was bountiful George had decided to supplement it with the natural prairie hay. There was no pause in his exertions; task followed task in swift succession. Rising in the sharp cold of the dawn, he toiled assiduously until the sunset splendors died out in paling green and crimson on the far rim of the plain.|$|E
60|$|The {{dazzling}} {{blue of the}} sky {{was broken}} by rounded masses of silver-edged clouds that drove along before a fresh northwest breeze. Streaked by their speeding shadows, the great plain stretched away, checkered by ranks of marigolds and tall crimson flowers of the lily kind that swayed as the rippling grasses changed color in the wind. A mile or two distant stood the trim wooden homestead, with a tall windmill frame near by, girt by broad sweeps of dark-green wheat and oats. These were interspersed with stretches of uncovered soil, glowing a deep chocolate-brown, which Muriel knew was the summer fallow resting after a cereal crop. Beyond the last strip of rich color, there spread, shining delicately blue, a great field of flax; and then the dusky green of alfalfa and <b>alsike</b> for the Hereford cattle, standing knee-deep in a flashing lake. The prairie, she thought, was beautiful in summer; its wideness was bracing, one was stirred into cheerfulness and bodily vigor by the rush of its fresh winds. She felt that she could remain contentedly at the homestead for a long time; and then her thoughts centered on its owner.|$|E

50|$|At an {{elevation}} of 1627 m, the lake region has two ecosystems, steppe and wetland. The wetland flora are free-floating aquatic plants from the duckweed family (Lemna), common reed (Phragmites australis) and rushes (Juncus) while the steppe flora are shrubs and herbs (Astragalus, Onobrychis), vetches (Vicia), daisy (Artemisia), common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and <b>alsike</b> clover (Trifolium hybridum).|$|E
50|$|The {{saturation}} pollination {{technique was}} also applied to ladino and <b>alsike</b> clover seed production with corresponding increases. With California running {{three times the}} national average per acre for forage legume seeds, other states began to pick up California's techniques. By the 1970s and 1980s large scale saturation pollination had become the norm in US agriculture for many more crops which require bee pollination.|$|E
50|$|The {{population}} fluctuates year to year, but {{on average}} {{there are about}} 2000 living plants at any one time, divided among 33 known locations. Threats include forms of habitat degradation and destruction, including road construction and grading, mowing, dumping, herbicides, alteration of waterways, livestock damage, and invasive species of plants such as Japanese honeysuckle, garlic mustard, <b>alsike</b> clover, sweet clover, meadow fescue, and multiflora rose.|$|E
50|$|Wallerius is {{regarded}} as the founder of agricultural chemistry, mainly based on the significance of his widely disseminated work Agriculturae fundamenta chemica (1761, published in Swedish the same year as Åkerbrukets chemiska grunder and later translated into many other languages).

Knivsta has a small centre, where there is a library, some banks, shops, restaurants, cafés and the Knivsta railway station. In nearby areas there is also a sport and swimming hall. The Knivsta Municipality is often thought as expansive, because of the frequent immigration, mostly to the nearby town of <b>Alsike.</b> Many residents commute to Uppsala, Stockholm, or Arlanda.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Alsike</b> clover is a {{perennial}} plant with a semi-erect, sparsely branched, grooved stem, hairy in its upper regions. The leaves are alternate and stalked with small stipules.

50|$|Trifolium repens, {{white or}} Dutch clover, is a {{perennial}} abundant in meadows and good pastures. The flowers are white or pinkish, becoming brown and deflexed as the corolla fades. Trifolium hybridum, <b>alsike</b> or Swedish clover, is a perennial which was introduced {{early in the}} 19th century and has now become naturalized in Britain. The flowers are white or rosy, and resemble those of the last species. Trifolium medium, meadow or zigzag clover, a perennial with straggling flexuous stems and rose-purple flowers, has potential for interbreeding with T. pratense to produce perennial crop plants.|$|E

50|$|<b>Alsike</b> Church {{stands by}} a {{formerly}} important sea-route linking Uppsala, Sigtuna and Stockholm, {{in an area}} characterised by its old cultural landscape. Although the oldest parts of the presently visible church date from the 13th century, it was probably pre-dated by an earlier wooden church. The church is constructed largely in brick, a material not usually used in medieval churches in Uppland (fieldstone was often the material of choice). The use of brick {{may be explained by}} the vicinity to the more costly churches in Sigtuna or Sko Abbey (near Skokloster Castle). The main part of the church was probably built circa 1250-1350. The tower and the church porch date from the 15th century, and during the same century the church was also equipped with frescoed vaults; due to later damage these have been rebuilt and only fragments of the frescos still remain.|$|E
5000|$|Highway 57 {{originally}} was a north - south gravel highway that linked Drayton Valley to Highway 16 in Entwistle.

50|$|This runestone was {{discovered}} on December 5, 1947 during restoration {{work at the}} church in <b>Alsike.</b> Before the historic significance of runestones was understood, they were often reused as materials {{in the construction of}} buildings, roads, and bridges. The stone was repaired and raised next to the church in 1948. The inscription on this granite stone, which is 1.9 meters in height, consists of runic text in the younger futhark carved on a serpent that is intertwined in an intricate design. In the upper center of the design is a Christian cross. The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr5, which is also known as Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks.|$|E
