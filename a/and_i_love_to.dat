500|$|Years later, Barnes {{wrote about}} the effect this had on his batting style. There was one angle about this change of batting {{position}} that didn't appeal to me. I am, by nature, a forcing batsman. I like to take the shine out of a bowler [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> hear the ball rattling the pickets, or soaring over the fence... My footwork was quick and I often caused delight by stepping back feet outside the leg stump and square-cutting... If I were to become an Australian Test opening batsman I would have to conform to standard. I would {{have to put up}} the shutters... And so I came to the Second Test in Sydney ready to drape myself in the gloomy colors of a Test opening batsman.|$|E
2500|$|Schembechler {{also spoke}} in {{opposition}} to the extension of the football schedule from 10 to 11 games for the 1971 season: [...] "I think the NCAA made a mistake in going to 11 games[...] [...] [...] I love the game <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> coach it but I also realize that in college they still have to go [...] to school[...] [...] [...] [...] it does take away somewhat from their academic pursuits. I was concerned about that." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked why}} he writes, King responds: [...] "The {{answer to that is}} fairly simple—there was nothing else I was made to do. I was made to write stories <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> write stories. That's why I do it. I really can't imagine doing {{anything}} else and I can't imagine not doing what I do." [...] He is also often {{asked why he}} writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question: [...] "Why do you assume I have a choice?" [...] King usually begins the story creation process by imagining a [...] "what if" [...] scenario, such as what would happen if a writer is kidnapped by a sadistic nurse in Colorado.|$|E
5000|$|The English {{translation}} of the Latin is: [...] "I was not yet in <b>love,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> be in <b>love,</b> <b>I</b> sought what <b>I</b> might <b>love,</b> in love with loving." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bowtell {{grew up in}} {{a musical}} household, {{listening}} to her parents playing music all over the house. [...] "After dinner was over with Mum & Dad would often get out the accordions <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> listen, or play along on a pot or pan." ...|$|R

2500|$|Palmer {{sought the}} Democratic Party's {{nomination}} for President in 1920. In a crowded field of candidates, he presented {{himself as the}} most American of all. Campaigning during the Georgia primary, he said: [...] "I am myself an American <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> preach my doctrine before undiluted one hundred percent Americans, because my platform is, in a word, undiluted Americanism and undying loyalty to the republic." [...] Journalist Heywood Broun pretended to investigate: [...] "We assumed, of course, from the tone of Mr. Palmer's manifesto that his opponents for the nomination were Rumanians, Greeks and Icelanders, and weak-kneed ones at that....We happened into Cox's headquarters wholly by accident and were astounded to discover that he, too, is an American. ... Thus encouraged we went to all camps {{and found that the}} candidates are all Americans." [...] Palmer had considerable support among party professionals, but no track record as a campaigner or a vote winner. He won delegates in the Michigan and Georgia primaries but did so without demonstrating voter appeal. He also faced strong opposition from labor for his use of an injunction against striking coal miners in the fall of 1919. Though he probably never had a chance of winning the nomination, he ran a respectable third until his support collapsed on the convention's 39th ballot and the nomination shortly thereafter went to Ohio Governor James Cox.|$|E

60|$|These merchants {{interested}} me greatly. Humorous, self-contained, remorseless in trade, {{they were most}} delightful companions when off duty. They liked my father in his private capacity, but as a factor of the Grange he was an enemy.

I wanted to be in a band that sounded unique, so when we got into the second record, I made the {{decision}} to put the thumb up on the shelf and never use it again.

5000|$|As {{published}} in Miss Earth's official website, Michelle described her childhood days as, [...] "I {{was one of}} the best students in my school, my favorites subjects were science, <b>and</b> Spanish. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> play in the park near to my house with my cousins and friends, we used to plant flowers and pick up flowers to decorate our houses, we were like the guardians of the park, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> also <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> dress up like a model <b>and</b> imagine that <b>I</b> was a super model."

6000|$|... "I {{have been}} happier than I am now; at least, much gayer," [...] said Phoebe thoughtfully. [...] "Yet I am {{sensible}} {{of a great}} charm in this brightening moonlight; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> watch how the day, tired as it is, lags away reluctantly, and hates to be called yesterday so soon.

6000|$|... "I {{know right}} well {{the value of}} tranquillity, the sweets of society, the charms of life; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> be happy, as much as anybody whatever. But much as I desire these blessings, I will not {{purchase}} them by basenesses and infamies. Philosophy enjoins us to do our duty; faithfully to serve our Country, {{at the price of}} our blood, of our repose, and of every sacrifice that can be required of us. The illustrious ZADIG went through a good many adventures which were not to his taste, CANDIDE the like; and nevertheless took their misfortune in patience. What finer example to follow than that of those heroes? ...|$|E

But I didn't know you cared--indeed, I didn't--you are such a deep little thing. Nobody can ever tell what you feel. I never shall forgive myself, if you have been lonesome, for you are worth five hundred times as much as I am. You really do love Moses. I don't." ...|$|E
