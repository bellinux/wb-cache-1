25|$|The {{trial began}} on January 24, 1995 and was {{televised}} by Court TV {{and in part}} by other cable and network news outlets for 134 days. Los Angeles County prosecutor Christopher Darden argued that Simpson killed his ex-wife in a jealous rage. The prosecution opened its case by playing a 9-1-1 call from Nicole Brown Simpson on January 1, 1989. She expressed fear that Simpson would physically harm her, and he could be heard yelling <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background. Other material related to domestic violence was presented. The prosecution also presented dozens of expert witnesses to place Simpson {{at the scene of}} the crime, on subjects ranging from DNA profiling to blood and shoeprint analysis.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, the Skinkers found {{a man in}} London {{willing to}} marry Tannakin. On {{the day of the}} wedding, and despite all efforts to improve her appearance, her face was as pig-like as ever. With the wedding service concluded, the newly-wed couple retired to the bedroom. When they lay in bed {{together}} for the first time, Tannakin reached for her husband's arm, saying that she would release him from his vows provided that he would look <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face. He turned to look at her, and saw [...] "a sweet young Lady of incomparable beauty and feature, the like to whom to his imagination he never had in his whole life time beheld". He reached to kiss her, but she refused, saying: ...|$|E
500|$|Two of Bosse's older sisters, Alma (1863–1947) and Dagmar (1866–1954), {{were already}} {{successful}} performers when Harriet {{was a small}} child. [...] Inspired by these role models, Harriet began her acting career in a Norwegian touring company run by her sister Alma and Alma's husband Johan Fahlstrøm (1867–1938). [...] Invited to play Juliet in Romeo and Juliet, the eighteen-year-old Harriet reported {{in a letter to}} her sister Inez that she had been paralysed by stage-fright before the premiere, but had then taken delight in the performance, the curtain-calls, and the way people stared <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> street the next day. [...] Alma was Harriet's first and only—rather authoritarian—acting teacher. Their harmonious and sisterly teacher–pupil relationship became strained when Alma discovered that her husband Johan and Harriet were having an affair. [...] Both Bosse parents were now dead, and Harriet, ordered by Alma to leave, used a modest legacy from her father to finance studies in Stockholm, Copenhagen, and Paris.|$|E

500|$|Barrowman {{states in}} a behind-the-scenes {{featurette}} that Gwen brings a [...] "little bit of soul" [...] back to Jack, following her recruitment. In a 2007 interview, Eve Myles, who plays Gwen, describes the relationship between Jack and Gwen as a [...] "palpable love" [...] and opines that [...] "with Jack and Gwen, it’s the real thing and they’re {{going to make you}} wait for that." [...] The first two series suggest the possibility of romantic and sexual tension behind Jack and Gwen's working relationship, with Stephen James Walker drawing on the firing range sequence in series one episode [...] "Ghost Machine" [...] as a key example, as well as the scene where Jack discovers that Gwen has become engaged to Rhys in [...] "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang", the series two opener. AfterElton.com's Locksley Hall conjectures that Jack is attracted to Gwen because of [...] "her warmth, her sense of justice, her very ordinariness and lack of glamour", whilst Eve Myles explains Gwen's attraction to Jack by stating: [...] "the most monogamous woman in the world would probably go for him– it'd be hard not to". Valerie Estelle Frankel describes Jack as a [...] "compelling trickster", who acts out Gwen's private desires with his [...] "outrageous flirting". She suggests that Jack (unlike Rhys) is not mature enough to occupy the role of [...] "steady prince" [...] for Gwen, whilst Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her, [...] "he'd have to commit completely"; this is why he does not act on his feelings, because though Gwen would let him flirt with other people, he could [...] "never afford to do anything more". Gareth David-Lloyd, who played Ianto, feels that for Jack, [...] "there’s two different sorts of love going on there", and that Jack feels for Gwen and Ianto in different ways, although both have helped him become less emotionally isolated. [...] Lynnette Porter feels that part of the reason Jack leaves Earth at the conclusion of Children of Earth is Gwen's idealisation of Jack, which is so intense that he cannot stand to look <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wake of Ianto's death. Gwen hopes that she is reason enough for Jack to stay on Earth, but Jack is ready to give up any hero worship because he feels unworthy.|$|E

2500|$|After a mere glance <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pilot, Jack sums up Liz as a [...] "New York third-wave feminist, college-educated, single-and-pretending-to-be-happy-about-it, over-scheduled, undersexed, you buy any {{magazine}} that says 'healthy body image' {{on the cover}} and every two years you take up knitting for...a week". This is confirmed by Pete to be accurate, commenting that the [...] "knitting" [...] part, in particular, was uncanny.|$|E

2500|$|The {{litigation}} group, representing 41 certified patients (17 already deceased) in 28 families, submitted their {{suit against}} Chisso in the Kumamoto District Court on 14 June 1969. The {{leader of the}} group, Eizō Watanabe (a former leader of the Mutual Aid Society), declared, [...] "Today, and from this day forth, we are fighting against {{the power of the}} state." [...] Those who decided to sue the company came under fierce pressure to drop their lawsuits. One woman was visited personally by a Chisso executive and harassed by her neighbours. She was ignored, her family's fishing boat used without permission, their fishing nets were cut, and human faeces were thrown <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> street.|$|E
2500|$|Her friend's {{attitude}} immediately {{takes on}} a more threatening quality as a sudden lunar eclipse happens above them but before he can do anything he is confronted by Timbaland and SoShy's characters. [...] He tells them that this time he's brought a couple of friends, and the vampire and the cat man appear to back him up only for {{the three of them}} to be frightened away by much larger crowd that Timbaland summons. [...] The woman caught between the two sides looks down to see that her circular birthmark is glowing and looks like the eclipse, and the necklace worn by the vampire who was staring <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> club. [...] She quickly wakes up from the dream, only to see that the television is playing what it was {{at the start of the}} dream and the phone is ringing with her mother on the other end as the black cat comes in through the window.|$|E
