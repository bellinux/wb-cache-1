5|$|Distraction {{displays}} {{attract the}} attention of predators away from an object, typically the nest or young, that is being protected. Distraction displays are performed by some species of birds, which may feign a broken wing while hopping <b>about</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, and by some species of fish.|$|E
5|$|Fireflies use {{light to}} attract mates. Two systems are {{involved}} according to species; in one, females emit light from their abdomens to attract males; in the other, flying males emit signals {{to which the}} sometimes sedentary females respond. Click beetles emit an orange light from the abdomen when flying and a green light from the thorax when they are disturbed or moving <b>about</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. The former is probably a sexual attractant but the latter may be defensive. Larvae of the click beetle Pyrophorus nyctophanus live in the surface layers of termite mounds in Brazil. They light up the mounds by emitting a bright greenish glow which attracts the flying insects on which they feed.|$|E

5|$|Rudolf Höss, commandant of Auschwitz, {{said that}} the use of Zyklon-B to kill prisoners came <b>about</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{initiative}} of one of his subordinates, SS-Hauptsturmführer (captain) Karl Fritzsch, who used the substance to kill some Russian POWs in late August 1941 in the basement of Block 11 in the main camp. The experiment was repeated on more Russian POWs, with Höss watching, in September. Block 11 proved unsuitable for mass killings, as the basement was difficult to air out afterwards and the crematorium (Crematorium I, which operated until July 1942) was some distance away. The site of the killings was moved to Crematorium I, where more than 700 victims could be killed at once. By the middle of 1942, the operation was moved to Auschwitz II–Birkenau, a nearby satellite camp which had been under construction since October 1941.|$|E

25|$|Two more ships {{entered the}} sound — San Juan de Ragusa (650 tons, 285 men), the other unidentified. San Juan de Ragusa was in {{distress}} and sank — perhaps on striking Dunbinna reef. San Juan de Bautista attempted {{to take advantage}} of an ebb tide and sail south out of the sound, but ended up tacking <b>about</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flood tide to avoid the numerous reefs, before sailing through the north-west passage. After a difficult night, the crew were dismayed to find themselves {{at the mouth of the}} sound once more. But the wind blew from the south-east, and San Juan de Bautista finally escaped on 25 September and made it home to Spain through a terrible storm.|$|E
25|$|The {{host species}} varies {{depending}} on the location; the most commonly targeted hosts are ravens, currawongs, butcherbirds and Australian magpies. Several eggs can be laid in a single nest, sometimes by different females. Often resembling those of currawongs and magpies (but not ravens), the eggs vary in colour and pattern, measuring 48 x 32mm. They can be a reddish- or yellowish-brown to dull white, with darker brown splotches. The incubation period for this species is unknown. Upon hatching the chicks are altricial, being blind and naked. Unlike many other cuckoos, the chicks of the channel-billed cuckoo do not eject the other host eggs upon hatching or kill the host's chicks, but these seldom survive as the cuckoo chick is able to monopolise the supply of food. The chicks are fully feathered within four weeks, and leave the nest to clamber <b>about</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> branches, although chicks are fed {{for a number of}} weeks by the host parents after fledging.|$|E
25|$|The game {{comprises}} {{two main}} areas: Yasogami High School, {{and a number}} of labyrinths. In Yasogami High, the player can converse with characters, heal their party, develop items and equipment, and visit the Velvet Room where they can fuse new Personas. In labyrinths, the player's party explores while fighting enemies and finding treasures. As the player moves within the labyrinths, a map is filled out on the bottom screen, indicating how much of the labyrinth the player has explored; when a floor is fully explored, a treasure chest appears on that floor. The player also edits the map manually, drawing in the location of walls and adding icons representing landmarks, to make return trips easier. If a player does not want to map out the dungeons themselves, they can switch to an auto-mapping mode. The game features two types of enemies: Shadows, which appear randomly, and Fysis Oikein Eidolon (FOE), more challenging enemies that move <b>about</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field as the player moves, which can be avoided with the right planning.|$|E

25|$|Having {{broken through}} the barrier, the truck, driving in a zigzag fashion, knocked down random {{members of the}} crowd milling <b>about</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{pavement}} and in the three traffic lanes on the seaward side of the Promenade. The driver tried {{to stay on the}} pavement—returning to the traffic lanes only when blocked by a bus shelter or pavilion—thus increasing the number of deaths. After reaching the Hotel Negresco, the progress of the truck, already travelling more slowly, was further slowed down by a passing cyclist, whose attempts to open the cabin door were abandoned after being threatened with a gun through the window; followed by a motorcyclist, in pursuit from the Centre Universitaire Méditerranéen, who threw his scooter under the front wheels of the truck at the intersection with rue Meyerbeer, striking blows at the driver from the running board before being struck with the butt of the driver's gun, suffering moderate injuries from falling off the truck's side. The driver fired several shots at police from his 7.65mm firearm, close to the Hotel Negresco, as police arrived; they returned fire with their 9mm Sig Sauer handguns, gave chase to the vehicle and attempted to disable it.|$|E
500|$|Martin and Rustin are {{summoned to}} Vermillion Parish {{to examine the}} murder scene of a young prostitute. The woman's corpse, crowned with deer antlers and bound to a tree in a {{kneeling}} position, is surrounded by numerous twig latticeworks loosely resembling Cajun bird traps. Rustin notices several stab wounds and ligature marks scattered <b>about</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> corpse, suspecting the victim to be {{the centerpiece of a}} ritual murder—the [...] "paraphiliac love map" [...] to the perpetrator's fantasy. Martin dismisses his suspicions, and suddenly invites Rustin to dinner at his wife Maggie's (Michelle Monaghan) insistence, much to Rustin's dismay as it is his deceased daughter's birthday. However, he reluctantly agrees to come, but infuriates Martin when he shows up intoxicated.|$|E
500|$|Several {{journalists have}} {{commented on the}} {{apparent}} conflict between the group's sexualized and often violent lyrics and their stated spiritual message.

You have to interest them, gain their trust, {{talk to them and}} show you're one of them. You're a person from the street and speak of your experiences. Then at the end you can tell them God has helped me out like this and it might transfer over instead of just come straight out and just speak straight out of religion".|$|E

500|$|Citing {{continuing}} {{divisions within}} the Democratic Party, the ongoing Cold War, and the boom and bust cycle, journalist Samuel Lubell in 1952 stated: [...] "After seven years of Truman's hectic, even furious, activity the nation seemed to be <b>about</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same general spot as {{when he first came}} to office... Nowhere in the whole Truman record can one point to a single, decisive break-through... All his skills and energies—and he was among our hardest-working Presidents—were directed to standing still." [...] When he left office in 1953, Truman {{was one of the most}} unpopular chief executives in history. His job approval rating of 22% in the Gallup Poll of February 1952 was lower than Richard Nixon's 24% in August 1974, the month Nixon resigned, but matched by Nixon's all-time low in January 1974.|$|E
500|$|Chauvel {{ordered the}} 3rd Light Horse Brigade, {{which had been}} unable to turn the German and Ottoman flank, to move towards the New Zealanders who renewed their efforts, but they only succeeded in exposing their flanks, as the Australians were unable to conform to their forward movement. By 10:30, all {{progress}} had stopped. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade continued to hold on in the centre, while both flanks were bent back by pressure from the strong German and Ottoman force. The result was that the New Zealanders ended up holding a very exposed salient line on the forward slopes of the hills overlooking the Hod. Fresh German or Ottoman reinforcements from El Arish, then launched a fierce counterattack on a front of <b>about</b> , <b>on</b> <b>the</b> centre. This fell on the Canterbury and Auckland Regiments and a squadron of Warwickshire Yeomanry of the 5th Mounted Brigade under Chaytor's command. The New Zealanders were supported by machine guns; one section, attached to the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment, fired all their guns directly on the advancing soldiers, stopping them when they were within [...] of the New Zealand position.|$|E
500|$|... "Swingin Party" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Westerberg and {{produced}} by Tommy Ramone, and was recorded by The Replacements. It is an indie rock and rock and roll ballad with influences from jazz, country and new wave. It features staccato chords instrumented by electric guitar. According to Bill Janovitz from AllMusic, the song climbs scales in a way reminiscent of [...] "Somethin' Stupid" [...] by Frank Sinatra and Nancy Sinatra (1967). The lyrics are introspective, and portray the protagonist's [...] "feigned nonchalance". Writing for Spin, editor J.D. opined that the song's theme is [...] "literary reflections" [...] as Westerberg sings, [...] "Quttin' school and goin' to work and never goin' fishin'". According to Tim Holmes of Rolling Stone, the song's theme is that [...] "life is a lilting series of ultimately empty, but nonetheless compulsory, soirees", while Robert Hilburn from the Los Angeles Times wrote that the song is [...] "about loneliness and youthful insecurity". In an interview for the Los Angeles Times, Westerberg said: [...] "One {{of the reasons we}} used to drink so much is that it was scary going up on stage. That's one of the things 'Swingin' Party' is all <b>about</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album ... how it is a little frightening to put yourself on display all the time." ...|$|E
