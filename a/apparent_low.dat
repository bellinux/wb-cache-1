Though small as juveniles, iguanas can grow to 4 feet in length and weigh some 20 pounds An iguana will not grow properly without a UVB light source. The UVB is necessary because captive iguanas do not get natural sunlight and this UVB allows the iguana make vitamin D3. The purpose of vitamin D3 is to digest calcium. Without being able to digest calcium, the iguana develops Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD). Metabolic Bone Disease causes soft bones, stunted growth, permanent bone deformities, frequent broken bones, loss of limbs and ultimately, death.|$|E
5000|$|During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), {{there were}} <b>apparent</b> <b>low</b> {{atmospheric}} concentration of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), which {{was believed to}} be as a result of larger containment of carbon in the deep ocean, via the process of stratification within the Southern Ocean. These Southern Ocean deep waters contained the least δ13C, which consequently resulted in them being the location with the greatest density, and most salt content during the LGM. The discharge of such sequestered carbon was perhaps a direct outcome of the deep Southern Ocean overturning, driven by heightened wind-driven upwelling, and sea-ice retreat, which are directly correlated to the warming of the Antarctic, and also coinciding with the cold events, the Oldest and Younger Dryas, in the north.|$|E

Other systems use round-robin or random selection algorithms that entirely ignore load information or that only use a small subset of the load information. Rather than risk extremely bad performance on one hand or ignore the chance to use load information to improve performance on the other, we develop strategies that interpret load information based on its age. Through simulation, we examine several simple algorithms that use such load interpretation strategies under a range of workloads. Our experiments suggest that by properly interpreting load information, systems can (1) match the performance of the most aggressive algorithms when load information is fresh relative to the job arriv [...] ...|$|R

The RTC board approved the First Transit bid on a 4-3 vote, but after the Nevada Attorney General reprimanded the RTC for approving the contract without a majority of the eight members on the RTC board (as opposed to merely those present), which was determined by a district court judge that all 8 members were not required and the award was legitimate. However, in the fallout of the court decision, the RTC returned for a re-vote in which the board then deadlocked at 4-4 for multiple months. The RTC board decided that it was best to cancel the award and bring forward a new fresh proposal for bid, and gave Veolia a 1-year extension while the board found a means to obtain a majority to make a decision. First Transit subsequently sued the RTC to force them to make a decision.|$|E

It has been difficult for some shareholders to reconcile the <b>apparent</b> <b>low</b> fracture porosity figures suggested in the audits {{with the fact that}} the drilling on Shaikan has been notoriously difficult because of huge losses of drilling mud which have probably been lost into the fracture network. This is also in apparent contrast to reports from over 50 yrs earlier which indicated that the huge Kirkuk oil field in Kurdistan also has significant fracturing in its reservoirs and other apparent similarities between Kirkuk and Shaikan (Daniel, E.

5000|$|Grapes {{have been}} {{associated}} with health for many centuries. They contain organic acids (tartaric, malic, citric, tannic), B group vitamins, vitamins P, PP, and C, calcium, carotene, magnesium salts, phosphorus and potassium, as well as trace elements such as copper, iron, manganese, sulphur and zinc. Proanthocyanidins, first extracted from grape seeds in 1970, and resveratrol, found in grape skins, are currently being studied for possible uses in the prevention and treatment of cancer and other illnesses, and for anti-ageing. Proanthocyanidins are powerful antioxidants that can block the action of free radicals. Advocates of grape therapy argue that these antioxidants inhibit the development of cancer, and can be used in treating a variety of other medical conditions such as arthritis and diabetes. Grapes are said to be beneficial for protecting against cardiovascular disease and, because of their potassium and glucose content, they are argued to be useful for treatment of heart disease by strengthening muscle tone, improving heart function and having a positive impact on convalescence. Alternative medicine practitioners have at times also recommended grapes and parts of the vine for high blood pressure, menopause, varicose veins, high cholesterol, skin rashes, and urination problems. The grape diet was promoted in the past as a treatment to flush toxins from the body. The grape cure is also prescribed for a decline in nutrition, especially with patients with early stage of tuberculosis, for diseases of the liver, kidneys and lungs and for gout and secondary anaemia and, in addition, for mental disease, nervous disorders, and sexual problems.Recent research by scientists at UCLA has found that combining resveratrol with benzoyl peroxide may improve that drug’s ability to kill the bacteria associated with acne. The presence of resveratrol on the skin of red grapes has prompted some doctors to recommend that adults drink reasonable quantities of red wine to combat heart disease.

5000|$|The Homegrown Player Rule {{has been}} an {{initiative}} in England and the Premier League to allow for more domestic, English players to be a brought up from a younger age in hopes of creating more talented English players. Currently, the Premier League {{does not have a}} maximum restriction on the number of foreign players allowed on a team, but does require at least eight homegrown players. Greg Dyke, new chairman of the Football Association (FA), wants to implement much stronger regulation of foreign players. His intention is clear as stated in an op-ed piece so that England can win the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Some of Dyke’s propositions include: homegrown players in a top-flight 25-man first-team squad be increased from eight to 12 [...] two of which must be brought up in the teams youth system, and also changing the definition of {{what it is to be}} a homegrown player. Currently, to be classified as homegrown one must be on an English team for at least three years before the age of twenty-one in which Dyke would like to reduce to eighteen years. This would mean a teenager would have to be with the club at a maximum age of fifteen and players are not allowed to move across national boundaries, even European Union boundaries, before 16. Meaning such that, if a foreign player joined an English youth academy at sixteen, in three years time he would be nineteen. Thus said player failing to qualify as a homegrown player due to the fact he would be older than eighteen. This has become such a hot topic is because there are currently a group of players who have played 309 international games between them but none of them for England. [...] While there is currently a list of foreign players, to show the disparity of homegrown players versus foreign players on any given team, the below picture will illustrate such ideas, SkySports hosts an image detailing the number of homegrown players in each Premier League team.
