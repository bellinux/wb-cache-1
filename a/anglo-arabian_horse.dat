2500|$|AHA {{shows are}} for {{purebred}} Arabian, Half-Arabian, and <b>Anglo-Arabian</b> <b>horses</b> only. The shows consist of Arabian Community Shows that allow exhibitors {{to get a}} start in the show ring, followed by [...] "Class A" [...] shows rated by the United States Equestrian Federation and the AHA, which qualify riders to go to larger regional and national competition.|$|R
500|$|Selle Français {{are also}} used for the {{production}} of race horses in France. By crossbreeding them with Thoroughbred and <b>Anglo-Arabians,</b> <b>horses</b> are produced which are competitive in steeplechase (racing over obstacles). These horses are generally registered as AQPS (meaning [...] "other than Thoroughbred") in France. The AQPS studbook in France was created in 2005; before this, some successful French racehorses, especially those raced in steeplechase races, were registered as Selle Français. These include Neptune Collonges, winner of the 2012 Grand National race, and Quevega.|$|R

5000|$|Sometimes {{the word}} {{purebred}} is used synonymously with pedigreed, but purebred {{refers to the}} animal having a known ancestry, and pedigree refers to the written record of breeding. Not all purebred animals have their lineage in written form. For example, until the 20th century, the Bedouin people of the Arabian peninsula only recorded the ancestry of their Arabian horses via an oral tradition, supported by the swearing of religiously based oaths as to the asil or [...] "pure" [...] breeding of the animal. Conversely, some animals may have a recorded pedigree or even a registry, but not be considered [...] "purebred". Today the modern <b>Anglo-Arabian</b> <b>horse,</b> a cross of Thoroughbred and Arabian bloodlines, is considered such a case.|$|E
500|$|There is an {{extensive}} series of horse {{shows in the}} United States and Canada for Arabian, Half-Arabian, and <b>Anglo-Arabian</b> <b>horses,</b> sanctioned by the USEF {{in conjunction with the}} Arabian Horse Association. Classes offered include Western pleasure, reining, hunter type and saddle seat English pleasure, and halter, plus the very popular [...] "Native" [...] costume class. [...] "Sport horse" [...] events for Arabian horses have become popular in North America, particularly after the Arabian Horse Association began hosting a separate Arabian and Half Arabian Sport Horse National Championship in 2003 that by 2004 grew to draw 2000 entries. This competition draws Arabian and part-Arabian horses that perform in hunter, jumper, sport horse under saddle, sport horse in hand, dressage, and combined driving competition.|$|R
5|$|The Selle Français is {{generally}} bay or chestnut in color, {{the latter being}} a legacy of its origins in the Anglo-Norman breed. Gray is much less common, with its origins in the Thoroughbred and <b>Anglo-Arabian</b> <b>horses</b> {{that contributed to the}} breed. White markings, such as white on the lower legs, are fairly common within the breed, and are again inherited from its Norman ancestors. The temperament of the Selle Français is highly variable from one horse to another. This is due to the selection criteria for breeding stock, which {{since the beginning of the}} breed have been based on physical ability. In recent years, however, the ANSF and breeders have been working to create selection criteria that focus on temperament. The vast majority of Selle Français have good temperaments, quiet but energetic, patient and friendly. The breed is reputed to be intelligent and quick to learn.|$|R
5|$|The {{movement}} of Andalusian horses is extended, elevated, cadenced and harmonious, with {{a balance of}} roundness and forward movement. Poor elevation, irregular tempo, and excessive winging (sideways {{movement of}} the legs from the knee down) are discouraged by breed registry standards. Andalusians {{are known for their}} agility and their ability to learn difficult moves quickly, such as advanced collection and turns on the haunches. A 2001 study compared the kinematic characteristics of Andalusian, Arabian and <b>Anglo-Arabian</b> <b>horses</b> while moving at the trot. Andalusians were found to overtrack less (the degree to which the hind foot lands ahead of the front hoof print) but also exhibit greater flexing of both fore and hind joints, movement consistent with the more elevated way of going typically found in this breed. The authors of the study theorized that these characteristics of the breed's trot may contribute to their success as a riding and dressage horse.|$|R

50|$|In 1801, Zweibrücken was annexed by France, and {{the noble}} horses {{were moved to}} Rosiers aux Salines. However, Napoleon saw the {{stallion}} and mare herds at Zweibrücken Principal Stud re-established in 1806. The central facility and its many outposts and stallion depots were populated with more than 250 stallions and a herd of over 100 mares purchased from notable German breeding outfits, as well as fashionable Spanish horses and products of the formidable Austro-Hungarian empire. Less than a decade later, Zweibrücken was given to Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria, and Zweibrücken was retitled in 1890 as the Principal Royal Bavarian State Stud. During this period, large numbers of Anglo-Normans - Thoroughbred-influenced agricultural horses from France - and Arabians were stationed in Zweibrücken. The first organized breeding of <b>Anglo-Arabian</b> <b>horses</b> occurred at Zweibrücken during this time period. The region became widely known for its refined cavalry horses which combined the size and speed of the Thoroughbred with the more tractable temperament of the Arabian. By 1900, the Principal Stud of Zweibrücken comprised more than 250 head of breeding stock and young horses, 74 of which were state-owned stallions.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to define {{differences}} between front and hind hooves in dimensions and proportions of the measurements in horses of various breeds. 77 mares four to thirteen years old of four breeds belonging to different origin types were evaluated: Purebred Arabian <b>horses,</b> halfbred <b>Anglo-Arabian</b> <b>horses,</b> primitive Polish Konik horses and Polish Cold-Blooded horses. The dimensions were measured after trimming. Means in particular groups and differences between fore and hind hooves were estimated with the least square analysis of variance performed separately in each breed. In the four breeds studied, the fore and hind hoof dimensions from the lateral view of the hoof capsule have come out to be similar. The toe to heel length ratio approximates 2 : 1 in both hooves. Viewed from the solar surface, the hind hoof is wider at the heel buttress relative to the fore hoof. The greatest difference between the fore and rear hooves occurs in the capsule width, hence while recording this parameter, it should be defined which foot it concerns. The hoof width is the most highly correlated with other dimensions, as well as the correlations between the fore and hind hooves in this parameter are the highest. The hoof capsule width is the most characteristic parameter of the hoof...|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{each of the}} {{southern}} states had a very distinct population: Rhineland-Palatinate was a center for the breeding of elegant <b>Anglo-Arabian</b> riding <b>horses,</b> Baden-Württemberg bred Arabians and Arab-influenced riding horses at the State Stud of Marbach, and Bavaria was home to the ancient heavy warmblood Rottaler. Of late, these three regions have combined their breeding and marketing efforts, so the modern Bavarian Warmblood, Württemberger, and Zweibrücker are increasingly indistinguishable. Similarly, the eastern states of Berlin-Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony, and Thuringia have begun hosting a common stallion inspection. Each of these states has had its own flavor of warmblood, though perhaps the Brandenburger was best known.|$|R
5000|$|A {{crossbred}} {{horse is}} sometimes called a [...] "grade" [...] horse, but this usage is not entirely correct: crossbreds with known ancestry and a pedigree on both sides are often quite valuable for their mix of breed characteristics—some {{to the point that}} a new breed registry is created for them, and the [...] "crossbred" [...] eventually becomes a separate, new breed with true-breeding characteristics. Popular crossbreds that in time obtained their own breed registry include the Irish Sport Horse (Irish Draught/Thoroughbred), Quarab (American Quarter Horse/Arabian <b>horse),</b> <b>Anglo-Arabian</b> (Thoroughbred/Arabian), German riding pony (Assorted pony breeds crossed on assorted light saddle horse breeds) AraAppaloosa (Arabian and Appaloosa), and the National Show Horse (American Saddlebred/Arabian).|$|R
40|$|Allelic and haplotypic {{variations}} at 27 SNP sites {{identified in}} four CpG islands of OAS 1 were {{described in a}} group of <b>Anglo-Arabian</b> and Hucul <b>horses.</b> Variation in the type of less frequent alleles was the source of variability among breeds. A number of putative LD blocks were identified which could be used to study changes in the genetic structure between generations of both breeds concerning susceptibility to flaviviral infections. Some of the identified SNPs may {{have an impact on the}} transcriptional activity of OAS 1 or could lead to amino acid substitution influencing proper function of OAS 1 enzyme. In the light of recent studies, the described genetic variability of investigated CpG islands might be important in view of the effectiveness of viral incorporation into the host genome.
