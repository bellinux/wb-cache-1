25|$|There are two {{different}} kinds of <b>aphasic</b> patients: Expressive Aphasia (also known as Broca's Aphasia) and receptive aphasia (also known as Wernicke's Aphasia). There are three distinctive dimensions to phonetics: manner of articulation, place of articulation, and voicing.|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} psychologists {{conducted}} a study to test the McGurk effect with Aphasia patients and speech reading. The subjects watched dubbed videos in which the audio and visual did not match. Then after they completed {{the first part of}} the experiment, the experimenters taught the <b>aphasic</b> patients to speech read, which is the ability to read lips. The experimenters then conducted the same test and found that the people still had more of an advantage of audio only over visual only, but they also found that the subjects did better in audio-visual than audio alone. The patients also did improve their place of articulation and their manner of articulation. This all means that <b>aphasic</b> patients might benefit from learning how to speech read (lip reading).|$|E
40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} and to compare {{quality of life}} (QOL) in fluent and non-fluent <b>aphasics.</b> Methods This is a prospective, quantitative, and transversal study. We included 11 stroke patients with aphasia (five non-fluent <b>aphasics</b> augmentative and alternative communication users and six fluent <b>aphasics).</b> Data was gathered from the Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale (SS-QOL), a structure interview, and The Modified Rankin Scale. Results The non-fluent <b>aphasics</b> presented poorer Rankin {{and quality of life}} than the fluent <b>aphasics.</b> The major difference occurred in the fields of language and upper extremity function. The three most affected domains in non-fluent <b>aphasics</b> were language, social roles, and thinking, whereas in the fluent <b>aphasics</b> were personality, social roles, and thinking. All the subjects referred a worse quality of life after stroke. The domains of language and self-care were identified as the most affected after stroke. Conclusion This study demonstrated that, in general, non-fluent <b>aphasics</b> have lower quality of life than fluent <b>aphasics.</b> However, this difference is not homogeneous among the several quality of life domains. Additionally, this research evidences a relationship between aphasia severity and individual functionality, implying impairment in quality of life, especially for non-fluent <b>aphasics...</b>|$|R
40|$|The <b>aphasics</b> {{constitute}} an important segment of our population. Interacting with them requires special procedures. Some of the caregivers of the <b>aphasics</b> {{and some other}} members of society often dismiss the speech of the <b>aphasics</b> as irrelevant and incoherent. This attitude towards the <b>aphasics</b> is counter-productive, as the interlocutors {{as well as the}} <b>aphasics</b> get frustrated during interactions. Against this background, this paper examined interactions with three Yoruba-English bilingual <b>aphasics,</b> using the relevance theory, with a view to revealing the systematic ways the meanings of the utterances of <b>aphasics</b> can be decoded by somebody who is not present when such a speech was recorded. The paper concludes that a better way of making inferences from the discourse of <b>aphasics</b> is to enter their worlds of experience, show interest in their discourses, make assumptions about their ostensions. In most cases, the discourses of <b>aphasics</b> fulfil {{at least one of the}} Extent Conditions. This implies that the discourses of <b>aphasics</b> are relevant and the effort expended in processing them can be reduced if the interlocutor/analyst appropriately deplores the necessary contextual cues and clues.

40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{an error}} type {{that is expected}} to occur in <b>aphasics</b> suffering from a phonological disorder, i. e. Wernicke's and conduction <b>aphasics,</b> but not in <b>aphasics</b> suffering from a phonetic disorder, i. e. Broca's <b>aphasics.</b> The critical notion is 'phonological length'. It will be argued {{that it is impossible to}} define phonological length in articulatory-phonetic terms. Rather it should be defined in structural, that is, purely phonological terms. This suggests that the difference between the pairs /a,i,e,o,u/, the so-called long vowels, and /a,I,E,c,u/, the so-called short vowels, is phonologically based and not phonetically based. It is thus hypothesized that errors concerning phonological length may occur in patients with a phonological disorder, but are not expected in patients with an articulatory problem. To test this hypothesis an error analysis was made of the phonemic paraphasias produced by seven Broca's, four conduction and two Wernicke's <b>aphasics.</b> The results support the hypothesis: conduction and Wernicke's <b>aphasics</b> produce significantly more errors concerning vowel length than do Broca's <b>aphasics...</b>|$|R

25|$|Broca {{is celebrated}} for his {{discovery}} of the speech production center of the brain located in the ventroposterior region of the frontal lobes (now known as Broca's area). He arrived at this discovery by studying the brains of <b>aphasic</b> patients (persons with speech and language disorders resulting from brain injuries).|$|E
25|$|A {{differential}} diagnosis {{must be used}} in order to rule out other similar or alternative disorders. Although disorders such as expressive aphasia, conduction aphasia, and dysarthria involve similar symptoms as apraxia of speech, the disorders must be distinguished in order to correctly treat the patients. While AOS involves the motor planning or processing stage of speech, <b>aphasic</b> disorders can involve other language processes.|$|E
40|$|This study {{tests the}} recent claim that Broca’s <b>aphasics</b> are {{impaired}} in automatic lexical access, including the retrieval of word meaning. Subjects {{are required to}} perform a lexical decision on visually presented prime target pairs. Half of the word targets are preceded by a related word, half by an unrelated word. Primes and targets are presented with a long stimulus-onset-asynchrony (SOA) of 1400 msec and with a short SOA of 300 msec. Normal priming effects are observed in Broca’s <b>aphasics</b> for both SOAs. This result is discussed {{in the context of}} the claim that Broca’s <b>aphasics</b> suffer from an impairment in the automatic access of lexical–semantic information. It is argued that none of the current priming studies provides evidence supporting this claim, since with short SOAs priming effects have been reliably obtained in Broca’s <b>aphasics.</b> The results are more compatible with the claim that in many Broca’s <b>aphasics</b> the functional locus of their comprehension deficit is at the level of postlexical integration processes...|$|R

We show that the paragrammatisms of the <b>aphasics</b> are qualitatively identical to the grammatical errors of normal subjects, although {{they are much more}} frequent. The reason for this is discuss-ed in terms of models of speech production; we argue that paragrammatisms are a consequence of a breakdown in the control processes...|$|R

25|$|Primary {{progressive}} aphasia (PPA) is a syndrome {{characterized by}} a progressive language deficit without other features of dementia {{for at least two}} years. <b>Aphasic</b> patients exhibit impairment in gestural expression and comprehension, with the degree of impairment being commensurate with the degree of severity in aphasia. Use of BPO over IO pantomimes has been used extensively in the assessment of aphasia, but with varied interpretations.|$|E
25|$|Many {{researchers}} have advanced {{the idea that}} the regressive use of BPO pantomimes reflects the presence of a central symbolic deficit in <b>aphasic</b> patients. It is suggested this is due to BPO pantomimes offering a more concrete representation of an object and permits a more vivid experience of affective component of the pretended action. However, others interpret BPO pantomiming in aphasics as being indicative of apraxic motor disturbance, due to the high-comorbidity between Aphasia and Apraxia.|$|E
25|$|Receptive aphasia: The {{patients}} {{suffer from}} lesions or damage {{located in the}} left temproparietal lobe. Receptive <b>Aphasic</b> patients mostly suffer from lexical-semantic difficulties, but also have difficulties in comprehension tasks. Though they have difficulty saying things or describing things, these people showed {{that they could do}} well in online comprehension tasks. This is closely related to Parkinson's disease because both of the diseases have trouble in distinguishing irregular verbs. For instance using the example of the dog went home, a person suffering from expressive aphasia or Parkinson's disease would say the dog goed home.|$|E

40|$|The {{most notable}} feature of Broca 2 ̆ 7 s aphasia is 2 ̆ 2 agrammatic 2 ̆ 2 speech production, with loss of fluency and {{constriction}} of vocabulary. In addition, some Broca 2 ̆ 7 s <b>aphasics</b> {{have been found}} to exhibit difficulties in sentence comprehension, though the source of their comprehension problems remains controversial. One theory of agrammatism identifies impairment of the syntactic component, predicting errors both in comprehension and production. If there is a central syntactic deficit, then Broca 2 ̆ 7 s <b>aphasics</b> patients would be expected to perform poorly on sentences in which the correct interpretation hinges on a full syntactic analysis, independent of variations in other task demands. They would also be expected to yield a different pattern of errors than Wernicke 2 ̆ 7 s <b>aphasics</b> on sentences with complex syntactic structure. ^ To investigate these predictions the present study tested Serbo-Croatian speaking <b>aphasics</b> (seven Broca-type <b>aphasics</b> with agrammatic output; five Wernicke-type <b>aphasics).</b> The test sentences were semantically reversible relative clauses, which were administered in three different experimental tasks; grammaticality judgments, sentence-picture matching, and judgments of semantic anomaly. Because it minimizes nonsyntactic processing demands, the grammaticality judgment task was expected to provide the most accurate measure of syntactic competence. The sentence-picture matching task was used to provide a basis for cross-task comparison and for comparison with results of previous studies. Judgments on the semantic anomaly task also served for cross-task comparison and as a control for subjects 2 ̆ 7 semantic comprehension of the sentences. ^ The results showed that non-fluent <b>aphasics</b> can process complex syntactic structures, as evidenced by their performance with relative clauses on the grammaticality judgment task. Their rate of successful performance was considerably lower on the other tasks, however. The pattern of errors by Broca-type <b>aphasics</b> closely resembled the pattern displayed by Wernicke-type <b>aphasics</b> and normal subjects. These findings are interpreted as support for the view that comprehension deficits in agrammatism reflect varying degrees of loss of processing ability, but sparing of syntactic knowledge. Although use of grammatical knowledge is impaired in some tasks, it can be exploited successfully in tasks that minimize processing load. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of aphasics’ speech in various languages {{have been the}} core of numerous studies, but Arabic in general, and Palestinian Arabic in particular, is still a virgin field in this respect. However, it is of vital importance {{to have a clear}} picture of the specific aspects of Palestinian Arabic that might be affected in the speech of <b>aphasics</b> in order to establish screening, diagnosis and therapy programs based on a clinical linguistic database. Hence the central questions of this study are what are the main neurolinguistic features of the Palestinian aphasics’ speech at the phonetic-acoustic level and to what extent are the results similar or not to those obtained from other languages. In general, this study is a survey of the most prominent features of Palestinian Broca’s aphasics’ speech. The main acoustic parameters of vowels and consonants are analysed such as vowel duration, formant frequency, Voice Onset Time (VOT), intensity and frication duration. The deviant patterns among the Broca’s <b>aphasics</b> are displayed and compared with those of normal speakers. The nature of deficit, whether phonetic or phonological, is also discussed. Moreover, the coarticulatory characteristics and some prosodic patterns of Broca’s <b>aphasics</b> are addressed. Samples were collected from six Broca’s <b>aphasics</b> from the same local region. The acoustic analysis conducted on a range of consonant and vowel parameters displayed differences between the speech patterns of Broca’s <b>aphasics</b> and normal speakers. For example, impairments in voicing contrast between the voiced and voiceless stops were found in Broca’s <b>aphasics.</b> This feature does not exist for the fricatives produced by the Palestinian Broca’s <b>aphasics</b> and hence deviates from data obtained for aphasics’ speech from other languages. The Palestinian Broca’s <b>aphasics</b> displayed particular problems with the emphatic sounds. They exhibited deviant coarticulation patterns, another feature that is inconsistent with data obtained from studies from other languages. However, several other findings are in accordance with those reported from various other languages such as impairments in the VOT. The results are in accordance with the suggestions that speech production deficits in Broca’s <b>aphasics</b> are not related to phoneme selection but rather to articulatory implementation and some speech output impairments are related to timing and planning deficits...|$|R
25|$|Expressive aphasia: Patients {{who suffer}} from this {{condition}} typically have lesions on their left inferior frontal cortex. These patients are described with having severe syntactical deficits, {{which means that they}} have extreme difficulty in forming sentences correctly. Expressive <b>aphasic</b> patients suffer from more regular rule governed principles in forming sentences, which is closely related to Alzheimer patients. For instance instead of saying the red ball bounced, both of these patients would say bounced ball the red. This is just one example of what a person might say; there are of course many possibilities.|$|E
25|$|Insights into {{language}} {{storage in}} the brain have come from studying mulilingual individuals afflicted with a form of aphasia. The symptoms and severity of aphasia in multilinguals depend on how many languages the individual knows, what order they have them stored {{in the brain}}, how frequently they use each one, and how proficient they are in using those languages. Two primary theoretical approaches to studying and viewing multilingual aphasics exist—the localizationalist approach and the dynamic approach. The localizationalist approach views different languages as stored in {{different regions of the}} brain, explaining why multilingual aphasics may lose one language they know, but not the other(s). The dynamical theory approach suggests that the language system is supervised by a dynamic equilibrium between the existing language capabilities and the constant alteration and adaptation to the communicative requirements of the environment. The dynamic approach views the representation and control aspects of the language system as compromised as a result of brain damage to the brain's language regions. The dynamic approach offers a satisfactory explanation for the various recovery times of each of the languages the <b>aphasic</b> has had impaired or lost because of the brain damage. Recovery of languages varies across <b>aphasic</b> patients. Some may recover all lost or impaired languages simultaneously. For some, one language is recovered before the others. In others, an involuntary mix of languages occurs in the recovery process; they intermix words from the various languages they know when speaking.|$|E
25|$|Anomic aphasia is the {{inability}} to recall words and names and is a common symptom of patients with Aphasia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research has been conducted {{to find out how}} these particular diseases affect TOTs in these individuals. In a study by Beeson, Holland, and Murray (1997), participants with Alzheimer's disease and three classic <b>aphasic</b> syndromes (Broca’s, anomic, and conduction aphasia) were instructed to name famous people. Those with anomic aphasia showed to be superior to the other groups in their ability to naming famous people that were presented. This finding was expected as the group has relatively mild aphasia. However, the Broca’s conduction and AD groups did not differ in immediate or delayed naming of famous faces. All of the groups provided some basic identifying semantic information for {{at least half of the}} items presented, suggesting a fair number of items potentially in TOT. Conduction and Broca’s groups showed strongest evidence of TOT, performing better than the other groups in identification of initial letters.|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to examine}} the nature of {{language}} production and comprehension deficits of Bengali speaking Broca’s <b>aphasics.</b> Two grammatical aspects have {{been the focus of}} the present research: postpositions and word order. Two tests were designed and performed on Bengali speaking <b>aphasics.</b> A task related to postposition was aimed at production deficits whereas a task on variation of word order concentrated on comprehension deficits. The results show that the Broca’s <b>aphasics</b> face more difficulties in both tasks than normal speakers of Bengali. The results of the comprehension task involving word order show that the people suffering from Broca’s aphasia cannot deal with the complexity of alternative word orders. Apparently, movement in the syntactic tree creates complications for the Broca’s <b>aphasics.</b> In particular the OVS construction of sentences with ‘distractor’ and ‘opposite’ pictures shows more marked results than other constructions...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{to what extent}} patients with Broca's aphasia and healthy controls rely upon prearticulatory and postarticulatory monitoring processes for detecting and repairing errors in speech production. Monitoring skills were investigated in a speaking situation with normal auditory feedback, a speaking situation with white noise, and {{a situation in which}} errors had to be detected in other-produced speech. The results demonstrated that the Broca's <b>aphasics</b> repaired a lower percentage of errors than the controls in the situation with normal auditory feedback, whereas their performance in the noise-masked condition was comparable. In contrast to the controls, the <b>aphasics</b> did not suffer from the presence of white noise. In addition, the proportion of covert repairs was higher for the Broca's <b>aphasics</b> than for the healthy controls. These findings indicate that Broca's <b>aphasics</b> concentrate primarily on prearticulatory monitoring. Possible explanations for this strong reliance on prearticulatory monitoring processes are discussed...|$|R
500|$|Transcranial {{magnetic}} stimulation (TMS), a new noninvasive {{technique for}} studying brain activity, uses powerful magnetic fields that {{are applied to}} the brain from outside the head. [...] It is a method of exciting or interrupting brain activity in a specific and controlled location, and thus is able to imitate <b>aphasic</b> symptoms while giving the researcher more control over exactly which {{parts of the brain}} will be examined. [...] As such, it is a less invasive alternative to direct cortical stimulation, which can be used for similar types of research but requires that the subject's scalp be removed, and is thus only used on individuals who are already undergoing a major brain operation (such as individuals undergoing surgery for epilepsy). [...] The logic behind TMS and direct cortical stimulation is similar to the logic behind aphasiology: if a particular language function is impaired when a specific region of the brain is knocked out, then that region must be somehow implicated in that language function. [...] Few neurolinguistic studies to date have used TMS; direct cortical stimulation and cortical recording (recording brain activity using electrodes placed directly on the brain) have been used with macaque monkeys to make predictions about the behavior of human brains.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} whether fluent and non‐fluent <b>aphasics</b> {{differ in the}} recovery of fluency, MLU and verb production in spontaneous speech {{during the first half}} year after stroke; and to explore the general hypothesis that the typology agrammatism-paragrammatism is a useful classification. Method: From two groups; fluent and non‐fluent <b>aphasics,</b> spontaneous speech samples from two weeks and six months after stroke were analyzed by fluency, MLU, Verb Type and Mean Frequency of produced verbs. Results: Results showed a significant difference between fluent and non‐fluent <b>aphasics</b> for fluency, MLU, Verb Type, Type/Token ratio of verbs and the Adjusted Mean Frequency, caused by overall higher scores in the fluent group. Non‐fluent patients improved significantly considering fluency, MLU and Verb Type, which was not the case for fluent patients. Conclusions: The difference in recovery between fluent and non‐fluent <b>aphasics</b> is due to a difference in language disorders after stroke. The findings in this study confirm the usefulness of the classification in agrammatism and paragrammatism...|$|R
40|$|The {{speech of}} <b>aphasics</b> {{is a kind}} of {{language}} in which constraints are ranked differently from what obtains in the speech of non-aphasics. Bilingual <b>aphasics</b> rank constraints in ways that reflect that they have more than one language in their language faculty. Therefore, this paper examined the manner in which constraints are ranked among Nigerian adult <b>aphasics,</b> using 40 purposively sampled Yoruba-English <b>aphasics</b> from the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. A normative text was given these subjects to read, and their speeches were tape-recorded. The data were analyzed perceptually. The frequency and percentage of each form of deviation noticed in their speeches were calculated. Optimality Theory was then used to explicate the way constraints were ranked by these subjects before those forms of deviation emerged as the optimal candidates. Three forms of deviation were discovered at the segmental level of their phonology, namely deletion, substitution and epenthesis. Generally, the subjects ranked constraints in ways opposite those of non-aphasics. Markedness dominates faithfulness in all their rankings...|$|R
