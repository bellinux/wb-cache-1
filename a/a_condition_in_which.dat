5|$|Onions {{suffer from}} a number of plant disorders. The most serious for the home {{gardener}} are likely to be the onion fly, stem and bulb eelworm, white rot, and neck rot. Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut, downy mildew, and white tip disease. The bulbs may be affected by splitting, white rot, and neck rot. Shanking is <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants. The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth (Acrolepiopsis assectella) sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{disease may}} present itself as tiredness, {{increased}} bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension. The latter, <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{the pressure in}} the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, {{blood vessels in the}} esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion, as well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.|$|E

5|$|Obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} Pickwickian syndrome) is <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> severely overweight people fail to breathe rapidly enough or deeply enough, {{resulting in low}} blood oxygen levels and high blood carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. Many people with this condition also frequently stop breathing altogether for {{short periods of time}} during sleep (obstructive sleep apnea), resulting in many partial awakenings during the night, which leads to continual sleepiness during the day. The disease puts strain on the heart, which eventually may lead to the symptoms such as heart failure, leg swelling and various other related symptoms. The most effective treatment is weight loss, but it is often possible to relieve the symptoms by nocturnal ventilation with positive airway pressure (CPAP) or related methods.|$|E
5|$|Early work in {{neurolinguistics}} {{involved the}} study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which {{is located in the}} posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out. They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.|$|E

40|$|Some {{time away}} from a problem, or {{incubation}} time, {{is found to be}} beneficial to creative problem solving. But are interruptions as equally helpful as breaks? An experiment was conducted to gain more insight into the differences between imposed and self-initiated breaks, and their effects on creativity, specifically on impasses and insights. There were three experimental <b>conditions,</b> (<b>a)</b> <b>a</b> continuous <b>condition,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> participants were not allowed to switch back and forth between tasks, (b) <b>an</b> interruption <b>condition,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> participants had to switch tasks at a predetermined moment, and (c) <b>a</b> break <b>condition,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> participants could switch tasks at their own discretion. Results showed that taking breaks at moments chosen at one's own discretion led to solving more insight problems and reaching fewer impasses than at moments that were chosen by others. Furthermore, compared to working continuously, interruptions led to fewer impasses, but not to solving more insight problems...|$|R

40|$|Four rhesus monkeys {{were trained}} to respond on one key when a one-second noise burst was {{presented}} through one speaker and to respond on a second key when the noise burst was presented through a second speaker. The acquisition of stimulus control was studied under three <b>conditions,</b> <b>in</b> each of <b>which</b> {{the relationship between the}} sound source and the response-key positions varied: <b>an</b> adjacent <b>condition</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the noise burst was presented through the key and a response on this key was reinforced; <b>a</b> reversed-adjacent <b>condition</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the noise burst was presented through one key and responding on the other key was reinforced: and <b>a</b> nonadiacent <b>condition</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> responding on the key nearer the sound was reinforced. Under adjacent conditions, stimulus control developed within one or two sessions. Under reversed and nonadjacent conditions, 10 sessions were required for the development of control.

40|$|The {{influence}} of selective attention on P 50 gating - {{the decline of}} the amplitude of the P 50 component of the auditory evoked potential (AEP) to the second of a pair of clicks - was examined. Three <b>conditions</b> were presented <b>in</b> counterbalanced order to 29 18 - 47 year-old healthy volunteers: <b>a</b> baseline <b>condition,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the double click was presented and no specific task was required, <b>an</b> attention <b>condition</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> attention to the clicks was required, and <b>a</b> distraction <b>condition</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> paired clicks were presented during rehearsal time of a reversed digit span task. P 50 gating, as measured with ratio and difference scores, did not differ across the three conditions. However, the amplitude of the N 100 showed an increase <b>in</b> the attention <b>condition</b> compared to the two nonattention conditions, supporting the validity of our task manipulations. The data on P 50 demonstrate that P 50 gating is not affected by attentional manipulations. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Background. The {{conclusion}} from a vast {{literature on}} literacy acquisition is that letter knowledge {{is one of}} the best predictors of literacy development. The question of the best way to teach children letter sounds has not, as yet, been answered satisfactorily. Aims. The aim of this study was the evaluation of a computer training program using integrated-picture mnemonics combined with a fading procedure to teach children letter sounds. Sample. Thirty-nine kindergartners attending mainstream primary education participated in this study. Method. Awithin-subject design was used. Each kindergartner learned letters under three conditions: (<b>a)</b> <b>a</b> fading <b>condition</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> letters are taught using a picture-supported first-sound mnemonics procedure in combination with a fading procedure; (b) <b>an</b> embedded <b>condition</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> letters are taught using the picture-supported first-sound-mnemonics procedure only and (c) <b>a</b> without-picture <b>condition</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> letters are taught using a first-sound procedure without-picture support. Dependent measures included a productive and receptive letter-sound test, and a first-sound isolation task...|$|R
