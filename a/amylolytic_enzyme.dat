40|$|Abstract: <b>Amylolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> {{represent}} {{a group of}} starch hydrolases and related enzymes that are active towards the α-glycosidic bonds in starch and related poly- and oligosaccharides. The three best known <b>amylolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> are α-amylase, β-amylase and glucoamylase that, however, differ from each other by their amino acid sequences, three-dimensional structures, reaction mechanisms and catalytic machineries. In the sequence-based classification of all glycoside hydrolases (GHs) they have therefore been classified into the three independent families: GH 13 (α-amylases), GH 14 (β-amylases) and GH 15 (glucoamylases). Some <b>amylolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> have been placed to the families GH 31 and GH 57. The family GH 13 together with the families GH 70 and GH 77 constitutes the clan GH-H, well-known as the α-amylase family. It contains more than 6, 000 sequences and covers 30 various enzyme specificities sharing the conserved sequence regions, catalytic TIM-barrel fold, retaining reaction mechanism and catalytic triad. Among the GH 13 α-amylases, those produced by plants and archaebacteria exhibit common sequence similarities that distinguish them from the α-amylases of the remaining taxonomic sources. Despite the close evolutionary relatedness between the plant and archaeal α-amylases, there are also specific differences that discriminate them from each other.

40|$|Alpha-amylase {{is a very}} {{important}} enzyme in the starch conversion process. Most of the α-amylases are calcium-dependent and exhibit poor performance in the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process of industrial bioethanol production that uses starch as feedstock. In this study, an extracellular <b>amylolytic</b> <b>enzyme</b> was purified from the culture broth of newly isolated Talaromyces pinophilus strain 1 - 95. The purified <b>amylolytic</b> <b>enzyme,</b> with an apparent molecular weight of 58 kDa on SDS-PAGE, hydrolyzed maltopentaose, maltohexaose, and maltoheptaose into mainly maltose and maltotriose and minor amount of glucose, confirming the endo-acting mode of the enzyme, and hence, was named Talaromyces pinophilus α-amylase (TpAA).
