500|$|The first commandment, {{according}} to Church teaching, [...] "means that [...] must worship and adore God alone because God is alone." [...] The Catechism explains that this prohibits idolatry, providing examples of forbidden {{practices such as}} the worship of any creature, and of demons... power, pleasure, race, ancestors, the state [...] money. Augustine interpreted this commandment as [...] "Love God <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>do</b> what you will". Explaining this sentiment, Kreeft states that all sin [...] "serves some other god, obeys another commander: the world or the flesh or the devil", if God truly be loved then one will do what God wills.|$|E

[...] "We wanted to identify with different sounds that were kind of iconic, 1960s sounds, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>do</b> our own twist on {{them to make a}} sound authentic enough that it felt realistic," [...] said Hines. The team placed a high importance on the game's music. During the game's development, composer Mick Gordon traveled to Sweden to meet with the team, and he spotted the game over three days, partly collaborating with both Fredrik Thordendal and Richard Devine. Gordon expressed the difference in composing the soundtrack for Wolfenstein: The New Order compared to other games: [...] "Usually you sign onto a project and then you're given a list of 150 battle cues to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Nirvana used dynamic shifts {{that went}} from quiet to loud. Cobain {{had sought to}} mix heavy and pop musical sounds; he commented, [...] "I wanted to be totally Led Zeppelin in a way and then be totally extreme punk rock <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>do</b> real wimpy pop songs". When Cobain heard the Pixies' 1988 album Surfer Rosa after {{recording}} Bleach, he felt it had the sound he wanted to achieve but until then was too intimidated to try. The Pixies' subsequent popularity encouraged Cobain to follow his instincts as a songwriter. Like the Pixies, Nirvana moved between [...] "spare bass-and-drum grooves and shrill bursts of screaming guitar and vocals". Near {{the end of his}} life, Cobain noted the band had become bored by the formula, finding it limited, but he expressed doubts that the band was skilled enough to try other dynamics.|$|E
500|$|Morrowind, {{following}} the tradition established by its predecessors in The Elder Scrolls series, is a free-form world, with few constricting boundaries on the player's actions. From {{the beginning of}} the game, players are put in a world where they are left to roam, steal, quest and explore, without necessarily {{following the}} main quest. Lead designer Ken Rolston, asked prior to Morrowinds release what he thought were the [...] "core, untouchable design elements" [...] of the Elder Scrolls series which [...] "set them apart from other games," [...] responded immediately: [...] "Free-form experience." [...] In Rolston's view, the game's central plot is a chance to introduce the player to a cross-current of conflicting factions, background themes, and to the characters of the game, rather than the primary focus of the player's experience. [...] "Every [...] game has to let you create the kind of character you want, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>do</b> the things you want.

[...] According to Ottman, he assembled the footage as a montage but it still did not work until he added an overlapping voice-over montage featuring key dialogue from several characters and had it relate to the images. Early on, executives at Gramercy had problems pronouncing the name Keyser Söze and were worried that audiences would have the same problem. The studio decided to promote the character's name. Two weeks before the film debuted in theaters, [...] "Who is Keyser Söze?" [...] posters appeared at bus stops, and TV spots told people how to say the character's name.

500|$|Aaliyah was {{released}} {{five years after}} One in a Million. Aaliyah had not intended for the albums {{to have such a}} gap between them. [...] "I wanted to take a break after One in a Million to just relax, think about how I wanted to approach the next album. Then, when I was ready to start back up, [...] "Romeo" [...] happened, and so I had to take another break and do that film <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>do</b> the soundtrack, then promote it. The break turned into a longer break than I anticipated." [...] Connie Johnson of the Los Angeles Times argued that Aaliyah having to focus on her film career may have caused her to not give the album [...] "the attention it merited." [...] Collaborator Timbaland concurred, stating that he was briefly in Australia to work on the album while Aaliyah was filming and did not feel the same production had gone into Aaliyah as One in a Million had. He also said Virgin Records had rushed the album and Aaliyah had specifically requested Missy Elliott and Timbaland work on Aaliyah with her.|$|E

If the movie or TV show bombs, you aren't to blame." [...] Hartman was considered a [...] "utility player" [...] on SNL with a [...] "kind of Everyman quality" [...] which enabled him to appear in the majority of sketches, often in very distinct roles. Jan Hooks stated of his work on SNL: [...] "Phil never had an ounce of competition. He was a team player. It was a privilege for him, I believe, to play support and do it very well. He was never insulted, no matter how small the role may have been." [...] He was disciplined in his performances, studying the scripts beforehand. Hooks added: [...] "Phil knew how to listen. And he knew how to look you in the eye, and he knew the power of being able to lay back and let somebody else be funny, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>do</b> the reactions. I think Phil was more of an actor than a comedian."
