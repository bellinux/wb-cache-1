25|$|The Beaver {{family of}} {{aircraft}} all have similar construction, with the frame fuselage constructed around a single longitudinal 6061-T6 <b>aluminum</b> <b>tube</b> {{that supports the}} tail, landing gear and seats. The wings and engine mount are similarly of 6061-T6 <b>aluminum</b> <b>tube</b> and attached to the main tube by connecting struts. The wing features <b>aluminum</b> <b>tube</b> spars and ribs. All Beavers prior to the RX 550 Plus and the SS had pre-sewn Dacron envelopes, which enabled builders to complete the kits {{in as little as}} 100 hours. The later models use conventional fabric methods and this makes the factory-claimed build times 150–200 hours for the SS and 180–200 hours to the RX 550 Plus.|$|E

American officials said several efforts to arrange the shipment of the <b>aluminum</b> <b>tubes</b> were blocked or intercepted but declined to say, citing the sensitivity of the intelligence, where they came from or how they were stopped. The diameter, thickness and other technical specifications of the <b>aluminum</b> <b>tubes</b> had persuaded American intelligence experts that they were meant for Iraq's nuclear program, officials said, and that the latest attempt to ship the material had taken place in recent months. The attempted purchases are not the only signs of a renewed Iraqi interest in acquiring nuclear arms. President Hussein has met repeatedly in recent months with Iraq's top nuclear scientists and, according to American intelligence, praised their efforts as part of his campaign against the West....Bush administration officials say the quest for thousands of high-strength <b>aluminum</b> <b>tubes</b> is one of several signs that Mr. Hussein is seeking to revamp and accelerate Iraq's nuclear weapons program. Officials say the <b>aluminum</b> <b>tubes</b> were intended as casing for rotors in centrifuges, which are one means of producing highly enriched uranium. The Washington Times reported in July that Iraq sought to acquire stainless steel for centrifuges on one occasion. Officials say that the material sought was special <b>aluminum</b> <b>tubes</b> and that Iraq sought to acquire it over 14 months.|$|R
25|$|The Atlas was a {{development}} of the Quicksilver and as such incorporated many of the Quicksilver's features, such as a 6061-T6 aluminum-framed, single-surface Dacron-covered, wire-braced high wing, with the ground wires suspended from a kingpost. The fuselage structure was also built from 6061-T6 <b>aluminum</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E
25|$|Like many Rans models, {{the family}} {{features}} a welded 4130 steel tube cockpit, with a bolted 6061-T6 <b>aluminum</b> <b>tube</b> rear fuselage.

500|$|The Hendrix {{defense team}} did not dispute that the drugs {{were found in}} his bag. They instead {{developed}} a strategy intended to demonstrate {{that he was not}} aware of its contents. Further, they offered substantiated accounts of how common it was for him to receive gifts from fans, which often included drugs. Hendrix was called as the first witness for the defense; he testified that fans showered gifts on him, including teddy bears, scarves, clothing, and jewelry. He explained that while in Beverly Hills, California, a female fan had given him a vial of what he thought was Bromo-Seltzer—a legal medication—which he put in his bag without knowledge of the illegal substances contained therein. Malone countered: [...] "You are charged with a serious offense, and your evidence is you don't really know how it got there, or who put it there", to which Hendrix responded: [...] "Yes." [...] The prosecutor then held up the <b>aluminum</b> <b>tube</b> in which the hashish was found and asked Hendrix to explain what he thought it was, he replied: [...] "A pea shooter", drawing uproarious laughter from the court. When asked about his drug use, he denied that he had ever used heroin or amphetamines, but admitted to smoking cannabis and hashish. He also admitted that he had used cocaine twice and LSD five times. He testified that his cannabis use had declined over the previous year, stating: [...] "I feel I have outgrown it". Hendrix admitted that he had seen people use heroin, but denied any further knowledge of the drug. He testified that he was given some gifts at a fan club meeting for the Beatles that were intended for the English group; when he opened them he found several joints as well as what appeared to be doses of LSD.|$|E

The August/September 2003 American Journalism Review states: On December 8 2002 Bob Simon reported on 60 Minutes that the <b>aluminum</b> <b>tubes</b> story was being challenged. He quoted British intelligence officials and David Albright, a weapons inspector in Iraq for the U.N. in the 1990s. Albright said, [...] "People who understood gas centrifuges almost uniformly felt that these tubes were not specific to gas centrifuge use." [...] Simon said to Albright: [...] "It seems that what you're suggesting is that the administration's leak to the New York Times, regarding <b>aluminum</b> <b>tubes,</b> was misleading?" [...] Albright: [...] "Oh, I think it was. I think—I think it was very misleading."Albright stated: [...] "If the U.S. government puts out bad information it runs a risk of undermining the good information it possesses. In this case, I fear that the information was put out there for a short-term political goal: to convince people that Saddam Hussein is close to acquiring nuclear weapons." ...|$|R

2500|$|Besides the {{previously}} mentioned family of popular 40-mm grenades, {{the only other}} major use of a High-Low System was by the Swedish firm FFV in their development of the 1960s-era Miniman one man infantry antitank weapon. [...] The Miniman was simpler and cheaper than anything imagined by designers in World War II. [...] Inside {{what looked like a}} rocket launcher tube, is a HEAT projectile attached by a break away bolt to an alloy <b>aluminum</b> <b>tube</b> with ports drilled in it and which acts like a kind of high-pressure chamber. [...] The launch tube in which it is mounted acts as the low-pressure chamber. [...] When the propellant is ignited in the <b>aluminum</b> <b>tube,</b> gases escape through the ports and are allowed to build up in the launch tube to the point of almost causing a recoil. [...] The break-away bolt then snaps, allowing the projectile to move forward.

2500|$|The Russian psychic Alla Vinogradova {{was said}} {{to be able to move}} objects without {{touching}} them on transparent acrylic plastic or a plexiglass sheet. The parapsychologist Stanley Krippner had observed Vinogradova rub an <b>aluminum</b> <b>tube</b> before moving it allegedly by psychokinesis. Krippner suggested no psychokinesis was involved; the effect was produced by an electrostatic charge. Vinogradova was featured in the Nova documentary Secrets of the Psychics (1993) which followed the debunking work of James Randi. Vinogradova demonstrated her alleged psychokinetic abilities on camera for Randi and other investigators. Before the experiments she was observed combing her hair and rubbing the surface of the acrylic plastic. Massimo Polidoro has replicated the feats of Vinogradova by using an acrylic plastic surface and showing how easy it is to move any kind of object on top of it due to the charges of static electricity. The effect is easily achieved if the surface is electrically charged by rubbing a towel or a hand on it.
