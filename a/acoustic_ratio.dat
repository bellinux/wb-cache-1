40|$|In this work, the Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation {{monitoring}} (QCM-D) {{was used}} to distinguish the dynamic cell adhesion behavior of human normal (Nthy) thyroid epithelial cells from poorly differentiated anaplastic carcinoma cells (ARO). The surfaces used to facilitate cell adhesion were bare titanium (Ti), gold (Au) and fibrinogen-coated gold (Fg-Au). The pattern of cell adhesion for both cell lines was that the largest acoustic signals were observed on Ti, followed by Au and last by Fg-Au; in addition, ARO cells always produced smaller acoustic signals than Nthy cells on the same surface and for {{the same number of}} cells in suspension. Moreover, the calculated <b>acoustic</b> <b>ratio</b> of energy dissipation over frequency change suggests a higher ability of Nthy cells to spread and potentially form more attachment points on the surface than the ARO cells, something observed in SEM images. Finally, we demonstrated that the application of two surfaces for cell adhesion experiments, one of which is Au and the other either Ti or Fg-Au, can discriminate with accuracy between the two particular cell types and potentially form a platform for differentiation between normal and cancer thyroid cell types...|$|E

In the current work, we are presenting a new approach where an isothermal amplification method is combined with an acoustic wave device {{for the development of a}} label free assay for bacteria detection. Specifically, our method utilizes a Love wave biosensor based on a Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) device combined with the isothermal Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) method; various protocols were tested regarding the DNA amplification and detection, including off-chip amplification at two different temperatures (30 °C and room temperature) followed by acoustic detection and on-chip amplification and detection at room temperature, with the current detection limit being as little as 100 Bacteria Cell Equivalents (BCE) /sample. Our acoustic results showed that the <b>acoustic</b> <b>ratio,</b> i. e., the amplitude over phase change observed during DNA binding, provided the only sensitive means for product detection while the measurement of amplitude or phase alone could not discriminate positive from negative samples.

40|$|Premixed {{reactive}} {{mixtures of}} fuel and oxidizer often contain regions of higher temperature. These regions of raised temperature are generally called hot spots and {{have been shown to}} be the autoignition center in reactive mixtures. Linear temperature gradients and thermal stratification are often used to characterize their behavior. In this work, hot spots are modeled as a linear temperature gradient adjacent to a constant temperature plateau. This approach retains the simplicity of a linear temperature gradient, but captures the effects of a local temperature maximum of finite size. A one-step Arrhenius reaction for H 2 -Air is used to model the reactive mixture. A one dimensional model is considered first to characterize hot spot behavior based on the relation between how quickly the fuel reacts (excitation time) and the time it takes for fluid motion to be induced (acoustic time). Plateaus of three different initial sizes spanning two orders of magnitude are simulated. Each length corresponds to a different ratio of excitation time to acoustic time or <b>acoustic</b> timescale <b>ratio.</b> It is shown that ratios less than unity react at nearly isochoric conditions while ratios greater than unity react at nearly isobaric conditions. It is demonstrated that the gasdynamic response is characterized by the a priori prescribed hot spot <b>acoustic</b> timescale <b>ratio.</b> Based upon this ratio, it is shown that the plateau can have either a substantial or negligible impact on the reaction of a surrounding temperature gradient. This is explored further as the slope of the temperature gradient is varied. Plateaus with a particular <b>acoustic</b> timescale <b>ratio</b> are shown to facilitate detonation formation inside gradients that would otherwise not detonate. This 1 -D model is extended to two dimensions with symmetric and asymmetric plateau regions, modeled using both rectangular and elliptical geometries. Even with clear differences in behavior between one and two dimensions, the hot spot <b>acoustic</b> timescale <b>ratio</b> is shown to characterize the 2 -D gasdynamic response. The relationship between one and two dimensions is explored using asymmetric plateau regions. It is shown that 1 -D behavior is recovered over a finite time. Furthermore, the duration of this 1 -D behavior is directly related to the asymmetry of the plateau...|$|R

40|$|Thermo{{acoustic}} engines convert {{thermal energy}} into acoustic energy with {{few or no}} moving parts, thus they require little maintenance, are highly reliable, and are inexpensive to produce. These traits make them attractive for applications in remote or portable power generation, where a linear alternator converts the acoustic power into electric power. Their primary application, however, is in driving thermoacoustic refrigerators, which use acoustic power to provide cooling at potentially cryogenic temperatures, also without moving parts. This dissertation examines the feasibility of {{a new type of}} thermoacoustic engine, where mean flow and an internal pulse combustion process replace the hot heat exchanger in a traditional closed cycle thermoacoustic engine, thereby eliminating the heat exchangers cost, inefficiency, and thermal expansion stresses. The theory developed in this work reveals that a large temperature difference must exist between the hot face of the regenerator and the hot combustion products flowing into it, and that much of the convective thermal energy input from the combustion process is converted into conductive and thermoacoustic losses in the regenerator. The development of the Thermoacoustic Pulse Combustion Engine, as described in this study, is designed to recover most of this lost thermal energy by routing the inlet pipes through the regenerator to preheat the combustion reactants. Further, the developed theory shows that the pulse combustion process has the potential to add up to 7 % to the engines acoustic power output for an <b>acoustic</b> pressure <b>ratio</b> of 10 %, with linearly increasing contributions for increasing <b>acoustic</b> pressure <b>ratios.</b> Computational modeling and optimization of the Thermoacoustic Pulse Combustion Engine yield thermal efficiencies of about 20 % for atmospheric mean operating pressures, though higher mean engine pressures increase this efficiency considerably by increasing the acoustic power density relative to the thermal losses. However, permissible mean engine pressures are limited by the need to avoid fouling the regenerator with condensation of water vapor out of the cold combustion products. Despite lower acoustic power densities, the Thermoacoustic Pulse Combustion Engine is shown to be well suited to portable refrigeration and power generation applications, due to its reasonable efficiency and inherent simplicity and compactness.

40|$|Abstract The {{surficial}} geology of {{the city}} of Ottawa primarily consists of soft soil sediments with low shear-wave velocities (∼ 150 m=s) underlain by hard bedrock with very large shear-wave velocities (∼ 2700 m=s). Earthquake recordings show unusually large seismic amplification values for weak motion. These unusually large seismic amplification factors were reconfirmed with the earthquake spectral ratio method using two stations, the horizontal-to-vertical earthquake spectral ratio method using a single station, and the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio technique using back-ground noise. These findings were the motivation for carrying out an extensive site response analysis, using finite element modeling (FEM), {{as a part of the}} seismic microzonation studies for the city of Ottawa. The FEM results confirmed the large amplification ratios for weak-motion recordings. FEM analysis was also carried out using a selection of strong-motion time series for the study area. The combined effect of the soil–bedrock acoustic impedance contrast and the level of ground shaking on the variation of soil amplification factors for the fundamental frequency were inves-tigated. The maximum value of the soil amplification factor for the fundamental fre-quency increased with increasing impedance contrast ratios until the soil/bedrock <b>acoustic</b> impedance contrast <b>ratio</b> reached values that were usually greater than 12; however, the change in peak amplification was much less with subsequent increases in the contrast ratio beyond that value. As expected, the value of the soil amplification factors for the fundamental frequency decreased with increasing peak ground accel-eration (PGA) of the input motion due to nonlinear soil damping. Finally, for the Ottawa region, a mathematical model is suggested for soil amplification factors at the fundamental frequency, as a function of the soil/bedrock <b>acoustic</b> impedance con-trast <b>ratio</b> and the PGA of the input motion...|$|R

40|$|Acoustic {{timescale}} Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition (DDT) {{has been}} shown to occur through the generation of compression waves emitted by a hot spot or reaction centre where the pressure and temperature increase with little diminution of density. In order to compensate for the multi-scale nature of the physico-chemical processes, previous numerical simulations in this area have been limited to relatively small activation energies. In this work, a computational study investigates the effect of increased activation energy on the time required to form a detonation wave and the change in behaviour of each hot spot as the activation energy is increased. The simulations use a localised spatially distributed thermal power deposition of limited duration into a finite volume of reactive gas to facilitate DDT. The Adaptive Wavelet-Collocation Method is used to solve efficiently the 1 -D reactive Euler equations with one-step Arrhenius kinetics. The DDT process as described in previous work is characterised by the formation of hot spots during an initial transient period, explosion of the hot spots and creation of an accelerating reaction front that reaches the lead shock and forms an overdriven detonation wave. Current results indicate that as the activation energy is raised the chemical heat release becomes more temporally distributed. Hot spots that produce an accelerating reaction front with low activation energies change behaviour with increased activation energy so that no accelerating reaction front is created. An <b>acoustic</b> timescale <b>ratio</b> is defined that characterises the change in behaviour of each hot spot...|$|R

It follows from the experimental results that the proposed text-dependent speaker verification system based on the 22 th-order MFCCs and SVM gives an equal error rate (EER) of 0. 0 % and average accuracy rate of 95. 1 %. speaker features of the input speech from test subject will be extracted and matched against the speaker model. A likelihood ratio will evaluate the similarity between the model and the measured observations. The general approach is based on a threshold set for the <b>acoustic</b> likelihood <b>ratio</b> to decide the test speaker is accepted or rejected. Conventional speaker verification systems use hidden Markov models (HMM) or Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to perform the likelihood ratio test [1 - 6]. These systems make use of a generative model for all speaker models. This will result in over-fitting and maybe cannot maximize the discrimination of speaker and impostors.

40|$|In {{their recent}} Recorder article “Reflections on Q, ” Lines at al. (2008) touched {{on two of}} the most {{fundamental}} problems which are of great interest to seismologists – namely the origin of seismic reflectivity, and its relation to the impedance and absorption. In the problem of absorption, its perceived dependence on the frequency is particularly important yet also most enigmatic. Because such theoretical subjects do not receive adequate attention in today’s applied-geophysics curricular and are often taken for granted, I would like to offer a couple of comments on them here. First, despite the simple paradigm implicitly accepted by most practitioners, the seismic impedance is not merely a product of wave velocity and medium density. The impedance in elastodynamics and <b>acoustics</b> is the <b>ratio</b> of stress (pressure, traction) to particle velocity in the seismic wave (Aki and Richards, 2002). From this definition, at normal incidence, P-wave impedance in an absorptive medium is...|$|R
40|$|A {{correlating}} equation {{relating the}} optimum acoustic impedance {{for the wall}} lining of a circular duct to the <b>acoustic</b> mode cut-off <b>ratio</b> is presented and compared to exact calculations. The optimum impedance was correlated with cut-off ratio because the cut-off ratio {{appears to be the}} fundamental parameter governing the propagation of sound in the duct. Modes with similar cut-off ratios respond in a similar way to the acoustic liner. The correlating equation is useful for the design of suppressors for aircraft engine inlets having a steady mean flow with a boundary layer and spinning mode noise source excitation. The correlation is a semi-empirical expression developed from an empirical modification of an equation originally derived from sound propagation theory in a thin boundary layer. Exact calculations of the optimum wall impedance were made over a wide range of frequency parameters, boundary layer thicknesses and flow Mach numbers to develop and verify the correlation. This correlating equation represents a part of a simplified liner design method, based upon modal cut-off ratio, for multimodal noise propagation...|$|R
