40|$|It {{was unclear}} {{what level of}} {{reliability}} was provided by appliance of the Eurocode load models for fatigue due to train loads, meaning {{that it might be}} insufficient. Therefore, it was investigated what the provided reliability is, compared to what is should be. Within this report, the focus is solely on fatigue induced by bending moments on reinforced concrete sections. Determination of reliabilities is done by creating a fictitious design, exactly satisfying the Eurocode. Then, this design is used as input for a probabilistic analysis, where the load models are replaced by measured traffic, and other uncertainties were quantified. The target reliability for the fatigue limit state proved to be vague in the Eurocode. However, the target reliability for ultimate limit states can be adopted as an upper bound, which was used in this report. The reliability was shown to be below this target, caused by, among others, a partial factor which is equal to 1 for fatigue loads according to the Eurocode. The idea was that variations in loads will converge due to the vast number of appliances. However, here it is argued that correlations between variations, which systematically affect each load its effect, invalidate this assumption. Also, reliabilities were shown to depend heavily on the span lengths (remarkably lower for spans of 1 - 10 m. It was demonstrated that such behavior results by lack of variety in the load model <b>axle</b> <b>distances</b> and loads, compared to measured traffic. Recommendations are, apart from further research, to increase the partial factor for fatigue loading. Also, a novel load model should be created with comparable variation in <b>axle</b> <b>distances</b> and loads as measured traffic. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|This master thesis {{seeks to}} develop a BWIM system by using the {{programming}} environment Matlab, based on existing Bridge Weigh-in-Motion systems and the founding theories behind it. The developement uses a beam model to create a strain signal based on it's properties and moment influence line. The beam model is subjected to moving loads representing train axles, which induces strain at a sensor placed arbitrarily along the beam. To use as realistic a signal as possible through this model, white gaussian noise and dynamic effects {{are included in the}} signal. The resulting signal is used to develope and validate the BWIM algorithm. When the methods for finding speed and <b>axle</b> <b>distances</b> was within a decent level of accuracy, the developement of a linear matrix method for finding the influence lines was the next phase. This was based on the properties of the train inducing the signal and the signal itself. This thesis shows how the different elements of a BWIM program can be solved programaticly. The thesis' empirical data was collected from Leirelva railway bridge, where a setup of strain gauges measured the bridge response for in all 6 different trains. This data was then used to analyse how a BWIM system would perform for this typical early 1900 's Norwegian steel railway bridge. Identifying the passing trains velocities proved to be of particular importance to the BWIM system. The velocities of the trains were found through a brute force method. The matrix method proved to perform well for all the different signals, creating a influence line capable of nearly recreating the original signal, given the speed, and <b>axle</b> <b>distances</b> and weight. However, since the actual train weights was unattainable {{it was not possible to}} control the identified influence lines by using them to calculate the axle weights for comparison. The final influence lines used for calculation of axle weights, was obtained by averaging the results for the different train passages and a final filtering to rid the resulting influence line of unwanted noise. This thesis highlights the difficulties of developing a BWIM system. By analysing how it performed for the data material from Leirelva bridge, the thesis shows that a BWIM system likely will work for these types of bridges...|$|R

Single vehicle and multiple vehicles on reinforced concrete T beam bridge were studied with variable surface roughness profiles. The effects of six different surface roughness profiles (very good, good, measured, average, poor, and very poor) were investigated for vehicle-bridge interaction. The values of the Dynamic Amplification Factor (DAF) were obtained for single and multiple vehicles on T Beam Bridge for different surface roughness profiles, along with the <b>distances</b> between the <b>axles</b> of heavy vehicle.

All trials were performed in a single blind and balanced order with a 5 - to 7 -day period between trials. Both saddle height and fore-aft position to pedal <b>axle</b> <b>distance</b> at a crank angle of 90 ° was controlled across all trials. The laboratory tests comprised a supra-maximal (peak power-cadence); an isokinetic (50 rpm) test; and a maximal test of aerobic capacity. The time to reach supra-maximal peak power was significantly (P < 0. 05) shorter in the 170 mm (2. 57 ± 0. 79 s) condition compared to 175 mm (3. 29 ± 0. 76 s). This effect represented a mean performance advantage of 27. 8 % for 170 mm compared to 175 mm. There was no further inter-condition differences between performance outcome measurements derived for the isokinetic (50 rpm) maximum power output, isokinetic (50 rpm) mean power output or indices of endurance performance. The decreased time to peak power with the greater rate of power development in the 170 mm condition suggests a race advantage may be achieved using a shorter crank length than commonly observed. Additionally, there was no impediment to either power output produced at low cadences or indices of endurance performance using the shorter crank length and the advantage of being able to respond quickly to a change in terrain could be of strategic importance to elite athletes...|$|E

40|$|The {{different}} {{rail vehicle}} research activities performed by various DLR institutes are coordinated and presented commonly within the DLR internal research project “Next Generation Train“ (NGT). The {{concept of the}} NGT consists of a high speed double-decker trainset with continuous floors on both levels. Running gears with independent rotating wheels {{are one of the}} main features. Each wheel is powered separately to achieve good acceleration behaviour. The traction motors of the independent rotating wheels are also used as actuator for the track guiding of the wheel pairs and a radial steering in curves. Additionally, independently rotating wheels (IRW) with motors at each wheel offers the fundamental advantages of a higher freedom at the general vehicle layout (low floor, arrangement as single wheel pairs with a long <b>axle</b> <b>distance</b> or in a bogie). The challenges {{for the development of a}} mechatronic track guidance system are to find a robust sensor to detect the current lateral position of the wheels relative to the track, which can be placed at a real running gear, a robust control algorithm, which is able to adjust itself to alternating operation conditions and a powerful actuator to realise the commands of the control system. The running gear is developed with the MBS-Software SIMPACK. Additionally, a test bed is set up using the existing DLR 1 : 5 scaled roller rig to investigate the sensor concept, to validate the simulation models and test different control algorithms. Finally the system must comply with the safety requirements of the standards and must overmatch conventional concepts in respect to the life cycle costs. Therefore, this ambitious concept of a passenger running gear has a realisation horizon of approximately ten years. The authors expect that further developments in the field of power electronics will enable motors and converters for each wheel with a power range up to 250 kW for acceptable costs in the next years...|$|E

Caused by the number of parameters, which affect the fuel tank installation, a {{product structure}} is created which is very difficult to handle. Knowledge exist that the structure in a nearby future will be considerable more complex. The purpose of the study has been to understand in why this complexity exist and find ways to break the trend of a growing product structure. The goal was to achieve a more standardized fuel tank installation. A theoretical study was performed in order to bring knowledge in relevant areas both in general theory but also in documentation at Scania. A comprehensive study was made over the parameters that affect the fuel tank installation including a weighting of impact, reduction potential and resource quantity. The result of this showed that the separation of chassis installation between the wheel configuration is the major concern when endeavor for a standardized chassis installation. After a comprehensive look at the similarities between the wheel configurations and chassis adaptations all the chassis were divided into three groups in regard of the arrangement of the steering and driving axles. The installation is proposed to be carried out within each of this three groups and then only driven by the <b>axle</b> <b>distance.</b> This would promote the standardizing work and it is estimated that there is a great potential in achieving large resource savings in the future. A small number of technical solutions was investigated very basic with an intention to give rise to future studies. The conclusion of this study is that a standardization of the chassis should be made by grouping the wheel configurations. An interface group with the focus area of the side member side is recommended to be started. A new chassis installation should be built from scratch with a characterization by standardized installation and positions of Scanias components located between the wheel axles. Produktstrukturen för bränsletanksinstallationen är ett av Scanias mest komplexa produktområden. Orsakad av den mängd parametrar som styr bränsletankarnas positioner och dess infästning skapas en produktstruktur som är mycket svår att hantera samtidigt som vetskap finns att komplexiteten i närtid kommer att öka avsevärt. Denna studies syfte har varit att skapa en förståelse över varför denna komplexitet existerar. Detta för att sedan finna vägar för att bryta trenden med en växande produktstruktur. Målsättningen har varit att nå en mer standardiserad bränsletanksinstallation. En teoristudie utfördes i ämnen som var av intresse för studien och då både inom allmän teori men även av Scaniaintern dokumentation. Vidare utfördes en övergripande studie av de relevanta parametrar som påverkar bränsletanksinstallationen varav en viktning av påverkan, reduktionsmöjligheter samt resursmängd utfördes. Resultatet från denna viktning pekade mot att separeringen av installationer mellan hjulkonfigurationer är det största problemet i strävan efter att nå standardiserade installationer på chassierna. Efter övergripande studier av likheterna mellan hjulkonfigurationerna och dess chassianpassning delades samtliga chassier in i tre grupper med avseende på placeringen av de styrda och drivna axlarna. Installationen föreslås att utföras inom vardera utav dessa tre grupper och då enbart styrd av axelavståndet. Detta skulle främja standardiseringsarbetet och det uppskattas att stor potential finns i att nå mycket stora resursbesparingar i framtiden. Ett mindre antal tekniska lösningar utreddes mycket grundläggande och syftar till att ge upphov till kommande utredningar. Slutsatsen av studien är att en standardisering av chassierna med hjälp av gruppering av hjulkonfigurationer bör utföras. En gränssnittsgrupp med fokusområde mot ramsidan bör tillsättas.

40|$|In this thesis, {{existing}} concrete municipal slab bridges are regarded. Many {{of these}} bridges were {{designed and built}} in the 1960 s and 1970 s. These bridges are still in service, and subjected to higher and more frequent loads than {{at the time of}} design. This leads to uncertainties in the safety of these bridges. Many municipalities become increasingly aware of these uncertainties and want to verify their bridges according to current standards. Especially the shear assessment is critical, since some former codes do not contain shear checks. Municipalities usually do not have sufficient financial resources to investigate and recalculate all of their bridges. A Quick Scan model is a cheap and fast tool to do structural checks, or to classify a number of bridges for structural safety. A literature study and Finite Element Modelling research was performed {{in order to make the}} Quick Scan more accurate. In general, existing municipal bridges are not exposed to the same heavy traffic as governmental highways. Nevertheless, municipal bridges were calculated with the same load models as governmental bridges. For the assessment of existing municipal bridges research was done to the possibility of reducing the design loads of Load Model 1 (LM 1) from the Eurocode. This reduction can be done with the α- factor on variable loads. The possible reasons for this reduction is threefold. Firstly, municipal roads are significantly less exposed to heavy traffic compared to governmental highways. Therefore the chance of occurrence of the governing vehicle according to LM 1 is decreasing. This assumption was supported by Weight-in-Motion measurements on a municipal road in Rotterdam. With the reliability index (β) for existing bridges in Consequence Class 2, this lead to a governing axle load of 225 kN, instead of the 300 kN from LM 1. The second reason for the reduction of the design load is the fact that municipal bridges usually have relatively small spans (5 - 20 m). LM 1 is designed to simulate a fully loaded bridge with a span of at least 20 m. For small spans it can be useful to calculate with real occurring traffic, since <b>axle</b> <b>distance</b> is more important than axle loads only. A third (small) reduction is the fact that an existing bridge has a shorter reference period than a new bridge. This leads to smaller chances of the occurrence of the governing vehicle. New load models for small span municipal bridges were designed taking into account these reductions. The governing vehicle for small span bridges is a 5 -axle vehicle with axle loads of 137, 5 - 165 kN and axle distances of 140 - 175 mm. Occurring shear forces due to these loads are higher than due to a long vehicle with higher loads, mora axles and greater axle distances. The new governing vehicle was used to determine the reduction factor α. This was determined by a comparative research in the Finite Element Modelling program RFEM. The resulting shear stresses and flexural stresses from the different load models were compared. For spans up to 11 m the loads from LM 1 can be reduced by an α factor 0, 8. This factor increases linearly to a factor 1, 0 for a 20 m span. Besides the differences in loads and dimensions, municipal bridges also differ from governmental bridges in lay-out. In general, the distance from the carriageway to the edge of the slab is larger for municipal bridges due to the presence of a footpath or bicycle lane separated by a kerb. Bridges in 10 different municipalities were examined on lay-out. Roughly 58 % of the municipal bridges in the Netherlands have significant edge distance (> 1, 2 m) This leads to a difference in the force transmission, since the high axle loads from LM 1 cannot occur near the edge of the slab. The influence of this edge distance for different spans was investigated with RFEM. Also, the variable and permanent loads were investigated separately to give insight in the resulting shear stress due to different loads. Distinction was made between slabs in cracked and uncracked state. Cracking has significant influence on the transverse force transmission of the axle loads. The transverse force transmission is influenced by the ratio between longitudinal and transverse stiffness, which was conservatively chosen as 1 / 3. Also, distinction was made between in-situ casted slabs and prefab slabs. The self-weight of in-situ casted slabs leads to a constant shear force on the support. A prefab slab was treated like a theoretical slab, where the self-weight leads to peak forces near the edge due to torsional moments near the edge. The critical edge distance was determined for different spans. For a cracked in-situ casted slab with an edge distance > 1, 5 m, the middle of the slab is always governing in shear. An edge distance < 0, 7 leads to the edge of the support being governing in shear. Research by Eva Lantsoght to shear force in reinforced slabs under concentrated loads close to the supports was used for rules and assumptions based on experiments. These rules were used to get a better understanding of the results in RFEM, and to develop the Quick Scan Model. The Quick Scan model uses findings from literature research combined with findings from finite element modelling. The output is a Unity Check which can function as real structural shear check if the concrete compressive strength and steel yield strength are known. When only dimensions are known, the Quick Scan model can function as classification for a series of bridges in a municipality. The Quick Scan model was tested by a series of case studies, which did not yet lead to the verification of the model. Results from the Quick Scan model were compared to results from the FEM research. Occurring shear stresses in the Quick Scan model are conservative with a maximum error of 11 %. With the possibility of lowering the reliability index β to 2, 5 (‘disapproval’ level) and taking into account the possible error due to several uncertainties, the upper boundary of the Unity Check was found as 1, 4. Bridges with a Unity Check: 1 < UC < 1, 4 according to the Quick Scan model need further assessment or material testing in order to fulfil the requirements. Extensive research was done to loads according to the Eurocode (LM 1) on slab bridges and the force transmission of these loads. The capacity of existing concrete slabs was investigated relatively brief. More research to the capacity side of existing concrete bridges is expected to be beneficial...|$|E
40|$|Brake {{systems have}} become {{increasingly}} complex. They must not only slow down or stop a vehicle under extreme conditions within short distances, but also reduce the effort exerted by the driver. This phenomenon is difficult to approach because {{it depends on the}} vehicle’s architecture. This is why, in this paper, the first part will give the basis for modelling of the complete vehicle including the frame and the tires, in a 3 D format. A 2 D control law model will be synthesized to obtain the best performances for road behaviour. This control law is based on the theory of Linear Quadratic control (LQ). It is also extended to cover the 3 D vehicle model. The last part gives the numerical simulation results which demonstrate the effectiveness of this law for vehicle performances.

40|$|In {{the coming}} years {{numerous}} existing traffic bridges in cities are subject to re-evaluation. In this paper a new probabilistic traffic load model for short-span bridges is proposed. As an example, site-specific weigh-in-motion data from Rotterdam, the Netherlands, {{is included in the}} model. The method proposed in this paper allows for a very efficient computation {{and at the same time}} takes into account the stochastics in <b>axle</b> loads and <b>distances.</b> For a simply supported 6 m single lane bridge the probabilistic load model provides a design load effect that is slightly lower than currently prescribed EN 1991 - 2 and the Dutch Guidelines for existing structures NEN 8700 and NEN 8701. This indicates that there is possible potential for a small reduction of the traffic load for short-span city bridges compared to the current standards. However, given the questionable quality of recorded measurements, a more extensive measurement campaign using WIM measurements is needed to get an adequate quantification of the traffic load parameters for city traffic conditions.

50|$|However, {{longer and}} heavier {{combinations}} are regularly seen on public roads; special permits are issued for special cargo. The mining company Boliden AB have a standing special permit for 80 tonne combinations on select routes between mines in the inland and the processing plant in Boliden, taking a 50 tonne load of ore. Volvo {{has a special}} permit for a 32 m, steering B-trailer-trailer combination carrying two 40 ft containers to and from Gothenburg harbour and the Volvo Trucks factory, all {{on the island of}} Hisingen. Another example is the ongoing project En Trave Till (lit. One more pile/stack) started in December 2008. It will allow even longer vehicles to further rationalize the logging transports. As the name of the project points out, {{it will be able to}} carry four stacks of timber, instead of the usual three. The test is limited to Norrbotten county and the European route E4 between the timber terminal in Överkalix and the sawmill in Munksund (outside Piteå). The vehicle is a 30 m long truck trailer combination with a gross weight exceeding 90 tonnes. It is estimated that this will give a 20% lower cost and 20-25% CO2 emissions reduction compared to the regular 60 tonne truck combinations. As the combinations spreads its weight over more <b>axles,</b> braking <b>distance,</b> road wear and traffic safety is believed to be either the same or improved with the 90 tonne truck-trailer. In the same program two types of 74 tonne combinations will be tested in Dalsland and Bohuslän counties in western Sweden: an enhanced truck and trailer combination for use in the forest and a b-double for plain highway transportation to the mill in Skoghall. In 2012, the Northland Mining company received permission for 90 tonne combinations with normal axle load (an extra dolly) for use on the 150 km Kaunisvaara-Svappavaara route, carrying iron ore.|$|R
40|$|A {{company for}} the {{maintenance}} of railway vehicles in Slovenia carried out, in collaboration with the Institute of Metal Structures (IMK), Ljubljana, testing and relevant analyses of the state of carriage axles. In order to detect cracks at carriage axles and to evaluate the quality of axles surfaced, ultrasonic and magnetic particle testing methods were used. Ultrasonic testing with normal and angle probes was used to detect internal cracks in the carriage <b>axles</b> using the <b>distance</b> gain size (DGS) diagram and the distance amplitude correction (DAC) method for reference specimens. Additionally, the magnetic particle testing method, with an apparatus permitting the detection of transverse and longitudinal cracks, was used to search for surface cracks. The tests performed at numerous railway carriages provided results, which make it possible to predict a premature axle fracture in further service. The non-destructive testing methods used permitted the detection of the cracks present, causes for the crack initiation were established, and the risks of crack propagation were evaluated. A critical evaluation of the carriage axles in terms of crack initiation and size is given. The prediction of the remaining life of an axle with reference to the potential propagation of the existing cracks is given taking into account the load axle acting on the axle and the axle age...|$|R
