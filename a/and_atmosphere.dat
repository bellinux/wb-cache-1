5|$|A {{turning point}} for Windle was the 1960 Australian Championships; he came second in the 1650yd {{freestyle}} behind John Konrads and was selected for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. He {{dropped out of high}} school to attend a three-month training camp in Queensland with the Olympic swimming team. Windle did not swim in Rome; team officials merely wanted him to learn from the routine <b>and</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of Olympic swimming. On his return to Australia, he switched to the tutelage of Don Talbot, who also coached Konrads.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} of Curse of Enchantia was mostly positive, especially {{in regard to}} its graphics and animation. However, the game was derided by some for its confusing user interface system, often illogical puzzle solutions and what some reviewers thought {{was a lack of}} quality humor, plot development <b>and</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> attributing it to the absence of text and dialogue.|$|E

5|$|Reviews of {{the game}} were {{generally}} positive. Critics focused primarily on the visuals, music <b>and</b> <b>atmosphere</b> as particularly praiseworthy.

5|$|The {{game was}} a major {{commercial}} failure, and Looking Glass ceased its self-publishing operations after its release.

5|$|The {{game was}} {{influenced}} by works that Chahi liked at the time.

5|$|Although the {{original}} PC version of Elite Force gained critical acclaim, the 2001 PlayStation 2 port received a more negative reception. Majesco's port {{of the game}} garnered mediocre reviews, holding scores of 54 percent and 52 percent on Game Rankings and Metacritic respectively. While the level design, story <b>and</b> <b>atmosphere</b> were praised, critics were negative towards what was seen to be a poorly performed port, with complaints focused on difficult controls, graphical problems and frame rate issues. In addition, the artificial intelligence was deemed to be significantly worse than the earlier PC incarnation of the game. Several reviews suggested that Majesco had simply not put effort into the port, resulting in a level of quality behind that which was expected of PlayStation 2 games at the time.|$|E

The first novel Balzac published without a pseudonym, he used many titles as he wrote and published, including Le Gars, Les Chouans ou la Bretagne il y a trente ans, and Le Dernier Chouan ou la Bretagne en 1800.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{previous}} film's financial success, Boogeyman 2 was announced in October 2006. Production of the film began in the same month with the hiring of Betancourt as director and Sieve attached as writer.

Filming took place in Los Angeles at the former hospital, Linda Vista Community Hospital, over a four-month period, beginning in January 2007 and concluding in April. Unlike the original film, which featured the Boogeyman as a supernatural entity, Betancourt strove to present a more grounded and realistic version of the mythical creature. Additionally, emphasis was placed on the writing <b>and</b> <b>atmosphere</b> to compensate for the film's small $4.5 million budget.|$|E

Kepler-4's eccentricity was assumed to be 0, however a subsequent independent reanalysis of the discovery data found a value of 0.25 ± 0.12.
