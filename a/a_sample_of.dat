5|$|<b>A</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> CSF can {{be taken}} via lumbar puncture.

Cushing demonstrated CSF was secreted by the choroid plexus.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> {{beryllium}} was {{bombarded with}} alpha rays from {{the decay of}} radium in a 1932 experiment by James Chadwick that uncovered {{the existence of the}} neutron.

5|$|Although (reportedly) {{molybdenum}} {{was deliberately}} alloyed with steel in one 14th-century Japanese sword (mfd. ca. 1330), that art was never employed widely {{and was later}} lost.

5|$|An {{excavation}} of Southcote Manor in the 1960s uncovered many Roman, Romano-British and medieval artefacts such as sherds and pottery; <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> {{the latter was}} discovered to have originated in Oxford in the 2nd century.

5|$|Around {{the same}} time, Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein {{produced}} a similar substance, {{but could not}} identify it. The oxide was independently rediscovered in 1795 by Prussian chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth in rutile from Boinik (German name of Bajmócska) village of Hungary (now Bojničky in Slovakia). Klaproth found that it contained a new element and named it for the Titans of Greek mythology. After hearing about Gregor's earlier discovery, he obtained <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> manaccanite and confirmed it contained titanium.|$|E
5|$|Astatine is a {{radioactive}} {{chemical element}} with symbol At and atomic number 85. It is the rarest naturally occurring {{element in the}} Earth's crust, occurring only as the decay product of various heavier elements. All of astatine's isotopes are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a half-life of 8.1 hours. <b>A</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> the pure element has never been assembled, because any macroscopic specimen would be immediately vaporized by the heat of its own radioactivity.|$|E

5|$|Feynman {{played an}} {{important}} role on the Presidential Rogers Commission, which investigated the Challenger disaster. During a televised hearing, Feynman demonstrated that the material used in the shuttle's O-rings became less resilient in cold weather by compressing <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> the material in a clamp and immersing it in ice-cold water. The commission ultimately determined that the disaster was caused by the primary O-ring not properly sealing in unusually cold weather at Cape Canaveral.|$|E
5|$|Löwig {{isolated}} bromine from {{a mineral}} water spring from his hometown Bad Kreuznach in 1825.
