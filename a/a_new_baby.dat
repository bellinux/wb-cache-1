25|$|Also {{during this}} time, Kelly's mother had <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>baby,</b> Erin, got married, and put Kelly's {{childhood}} home up for sale. Self-consciousness over her figure, {{along with the}} anxiety she began to feel, caused her to lash out emotionally, abuse diet pills, and briefly lose control over her life. The character's physical appearance is shown to {{play a part in}} her development. At various points of the series, she won the title of Spring Princess at a dance, and was voted her school's most beautiful girl. Kelly is aware of her appeal, but not to the point of conceit; instead, she is sometimes shown to be troubled by it. At one point, she entered a phase where she felt that no one took her seriously, which was heightened when Dylan gave his manuscript to Andrea for review instead of to her. During this time, she began to feel that people only liked her because she was physically attractive.|$|E
25|$|Another {{view is that}} a stutter (stammer) is {{a complex}} tic. This view is held for the {{following}} reasons. It always arises from repetition of sounds or words. Young children like repetition and the more tense they are feeling, the more they like this outlet for their tension – an understandable and quite normal reaction. They are capable of repeating all types of behaviour. The more tension that is felt, the less one likes change. The more change, the greater can be the repetition. So, when a 3 year old finds he has <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>baby</b> brother or sister he may start repeating sounds. The repetitions can become conditioned and automatic and ensuing struggles against the repetitions result in prolongations and blocks in his speech. More boys stammer than girls, in the ratio of 3–4 boys : 1 girl. This is because the male Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis is more active. Whilst they are pumping out more cortisol than females under the same provocation, they can be tense or anxious and become repetitive.|$|E

500|$|The Sesame Street episode (#1839) {{in which}} the death of Mr. Hooper was {{discussed}} was structured as all episodes were structured at the time, with individual segments that {{took place on the}} main brownstone set (called [...] "street scenes") and interrupted by inserts, or puppet skits, short films, and animations. The episode begins with a scene between Gordon (Roscoe Orman) and the Muppet Forgetful Jones (Richard Hunt). Gordon helps Forgetful remember something that had made him happy; as Davis states, [...] "Later, Big Bird forgets something that makes him sad". After several inserts, Big Bird walks backward with his head between his legs; when Gordon asks him why, he answers, [...] "Just because". Later, Big Bird listens to the adults conversing about <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>baby</b> who is due to visit Sesame Street with his mother.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of Series 4, Rachel is broody and upset that she is infertile. She and Adam begin an application process for an adoption, and are soon paired up with eight-year-old Laura (Katie Riddoch), {{the daughter of a}} drug addict. Adam and Laura bond at their first meeting at her foster home, and Adam and Rachel begin plans for her to move in with them. However, after a routine hospital appointment reveals that Rachel is four months pregnant, social worker Ruth Wylie (Samantha Spiro) retracts the adoption application, concerned about the effect <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>baby</b> will have on Laura if she moves in with Adam and Rachel. Adam and Rachel vow to take legal action against the adoption agency but change their minds after Laura's foster mother Jean (Jacqueline Pilton) persuades them to think of the effect it will have on Laura. Reluctantly, Adam and Rachel walk away from the adoption and instead plan for their own baby. The original Series 4 story arc for Adam and Rachel was radically different, and had to be changed considerably after Helen Baxendale learned she was pregnant. Mike Bullen quipped at the time, [...] "We're looking at a number of ideas, including alien abduction". Though heavily pregnant, Rachel's doctor advises her that it is safe to fly to Australia for Pete and Jo's (John Thomson and Kimberley Joseph) wedding in Series 4, Episode 8. On the day of the wedding ceremony, Rachel collapses outside the hotel, having gone into labour two months prematurely, and is rushed to hospital. She gives birth to a boy, whom she names Matthew Sydney Williams.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In modern society, a {{plenty of}} car {{accident}} is occurred {{and a lot}} of people get injury every day. For this reason, the importance of car safety has been increased and car safety has been extensively studied. Especially in many countries, the law about using baby safety seat is legislated to protect babies and children from accident. Thus, recently numerous products for baby safety have been developed. In this paper, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> type <b>baby</b> car seat is proposed to protect babies and children from frontal accident. In order to achieve this goal, design requirements of spring and MR(Magnetorheological) Damper which are main elements for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> type <b>baby</b> car seat are investigated...|$|R

2500|$|Stress Stress {{is not a}} {{cause of}} primary nocturnal {{enuresis}} (PNE), but is well established {{as a cause of}} returning to bedwetting (...) [...] Researchers studying children who have yet to stay dry find [...] "no relationship to social background, life stresses, family constellation, or number of residencies." [...] On the other hand, stress is a cause of people who return to wetting the bed. Researchers find that moving to a new town, parent conflict or divorce, arrival of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>baby,</b> or loss of a loved one or pet can cause insecurity, contributing to returning bedwetting.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{significant}} {{family tradition}} {{is that of}} naming customs. When <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>baby</b> is born, incorporating family names into the name for the new baby, or conversely not using family names for the next generation, can become problematic. What rules should be followed? Many ethnic groups have their own naming customs, variations of which might be found within the separate family groups of the parents. There are also differing ethnic customs of who {{has the authority to}} pick the name for the baby. When published lists of currently popular names along with expectations of individual family members are added to this mix, it can become a challenge to craft a name which pleases everyone.|$|E
2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>baby</b> is born or a {{child is}} adopted into an {{established}} family group, which contains a microcosm of social alignments found in many larger groups: the vertical relationship between grandparents and grandchildren, the horizontal relationship between siblings and cousins of a generation or age group, clusters of girls or boys and skill-based family alliances. The child grows up in this family, sees and learns the family lore as it is performed throughout the seasons and the life cycle. Not only is the family the first folk group of the child, it is [...] "the group in which important primary folkloric socialization takes place and individual aesthetic preference patterns for folkloric exchange are set." ...|$|E

2500|$|Saunders and French {{followed}} separate {{careers as}} well as maintaining their comedy sketch show. Saunders' biggest solo success has been Absolutely Fabulous. The comedy was, in fact, based largely on a fourteen-minute French & Saunders sketch called [...] "Modern Mother and Daughter". Saunders and French were going to star in the comedy together, {{but just as the}} studio had been booked, French received a long-awaited phone call confirming that an adoption agency had <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>baby</b> for her to adopt. Saunders proceeded to star in the comedy. The series, which she wrote and starred in as the irresponsible fashion PR agent Edina Monsoon alongside Joanna Lumley, who played Patsy Stone, brought her international acclaim and attention. The show ran for five full series, two telemovies, three special episodes, and a feature film over the course of twenty-four years from 1992 to 2016. The series is also known as Ab Fab and was broadcast in the United States on Comedy Central and BBC America, becoming cult viewing.|$|E
2500|$|A giraffe named Richard {{was born}} in late November 2007 and has been doing well. Also on March 21, 2007, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>baby</b> Siberian tiger was born. Its name is Vitali. On May 15, 2008, a baby gorilla was born to Zuri. Zookeepers looked through more than 1,400 entries for the baby's name, and on July 2, 2008, she was given the name Yewande (Yu-wan-day), a Nigerian name that would be given to a girl {{after the death of}} an elder in the family. [...] Her name was {{selected}} by Calgarian Justin Brouwer. On February 13, 2009, a colobus monkey gave birth; this offspring became the first to be born at the Calgary Zoo. In March 2012, Amur tiger Katja gave birth to three Amur tiger cubs at the zoo. The species is so highly endangered (there are an estimated 350 individuals worldwide), the births represented a 1% jump in the global population. In 2014, it became necessary to separate Vasili and Samkha, the two male tiger cubs, now almost full grown, from sister Kira and mom Katja (12 years old). Based on the Species Survival Plan recommendation, which manages genetics for future breeding, they were moved to Assiniboine Park Zoo in Winnipeg. In early 2016, a western lowland gorilla infant was born.|$|E

Their second son, Ronald Wilson Reagan, was born on February 6, 1911 inside the second floor apartment. Family legend has it that when Jack first saw his ten-pound baby son, he said, “He looks like a fat little Dutchman. But who knows, he might grow up to be president some day.” [...] In a small town like Tampico in 1911, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>baby</b> was such big news that four days after the birth the Tampico Tornado newspaper printed the rather unusual birth announcement that read, “February 10, 1911 [...] John REAGAN has been calling thirty-seven inches a yard and giving seventeen ounces for a pound this week at PITNEY’s store, he has been feeling so jubilant over the arrival of a ten pound boy Monday.” ...|$|E
