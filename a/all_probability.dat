He continued in his role of advisor during the reigns of Cnut's sons, Harold Harefoot and Harthacnut. When Cnut's stepson Edward the Confessor succeeded Harthacnut, Stigand in <b>all</b> <b>probability</b> became England's main administrator. Monastic writers of the time accused Stigand of extorting money and lands from the church, and by 1066 the only estates richer than Stigand's were the royal estates and those of Harold Godwinson.|$|E

Collecting specimens in the dry ridges is complicated by the millions of ants which eat the bait in the trap the moment it is set on the ground. Live collecting is the alternative, but the bait is usually digested by the time the animal is taken from the trap, making food research difficult if not impossible.|$|E

50|$|The proofs are elementary. Recall that P(A ∨ B) = P(A) + P(B) &minus; P(A & B), {{which implies}} P(A) + P(B) &minus; P(A ∨ B) = P(A & B). Because <b>all</b> <b>probabilities</b> are {{no bigger than}} 1, we know P(A ∨ B) ≤ 1, which implies that P(A) + P(B) &minus; 1 ≤ P(A & B). Because <b>all</b> <b>probabilities</b> are also {{positive}} we can similarly say 0 ≤ P(A & B), so max(0, P(A) + P(B) &minus; 1) ≤ P(A & B). This gives the lower bound on the conjunction.|$|R
