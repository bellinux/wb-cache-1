5|$|Michálek {{was born}} in Náchod in 1968. He {{graduated}} from high school in Přerov in 1987, and from Palacký University of Olomouc in 1992. He later studied in Masaryk University's management program, and received his MPA from Nottingham Trent University's executive program in 2010. After college, he worked as a UNIX programmer, business school teacher, and portfolio manager at an investment company. Michálek was a broker at the National Property Fund from 1994 to 1996, when he was fired after exposing a tunneling embezzlement scheme. The resulting court case found that he was improperly dismissed. He was later involved in compensating victims of financial crime. Michálek served as a capital market supervisor at the Czech Ministry of Finance from 1997 to 1998, a director at the Czech Securities Commission from 1998 to 2006, a director at the Czech National Bank from 2006 to 2007, a senior consultant <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Bank</b> in 2007, and the chief financial market inspector at the Czech National Bank from 2008 to 2010.|$|E
5|$|Ravalomanana {{solicited}} a {{loan from}} the Agence Française de Développement to further expand his business, but this request was denied, souring his view of France. His subsequent request to the World Bank for 1.5 million US dollars was approved, and in 1982 he founded the Tiko company. The representative of the World Bank to Madagascar at the time, José Broffman, secured the loan with exceptionally favorable reimbursement conditions that enabled Ravalomanana to sell his products {{at a lower cost}} than other small dairy producers, which gradually put his most significant competitors out of business. Broffman later left his post <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Bank</b> to become a principal investor in the company, joined by private investors from South Africa, Germany and the United States. As Tiko continued to grow, the entrepreneur began incorporating imported ingredients such as powdered milk from South Africa (constituting 80 per cent of the composition of Tiko dairy products) and surplus butter from Europe, further improving the profitability of his business and enabling additional diversification. Tiko Group first concentrated exclusively on the production of dairy products before expanding into fruit juices, ice cream, cooking oil and carbonated beverages. The Tiko slogan printed on many of the group's products, Vita Malagasy ("Made in Madagascar"), reflected Ravalomanana's national pride and his vision that Madagascar should develop a larger capacity to produce quality goods for distribution for national and international markets.|$|E

50|$|Following intense {{criticism}} in the 1980s for its support for destructive projects which, amongst other consequences, caused deforestation of tropical forests, <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Bank</b> drew up its own environment-related standards in the 1990s so it could correct its actions. These standards differ from UNEP’s standards, meant to be the benchmark, thus discrediting the institution and sowing disorder and conflict in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of environmental governance.

40|$|This paper looks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Bank’s</b> anti-corruption {{agenda and}} critiques {{it in two}} ways. It first looks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{limitations}} within the organization of <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Bank</b> itself: its apolitical nature, lending culture and its ignorance of the role it has played and continues to play in perpetuating corruption. It then looks at three recommended reforms that <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Bank</b> encourages as vehicles to stamp out corruption: privatization, empowering civil society and good governance. By analyzing <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Bank</b> as an organization and recognizing its limitations in addressing corruption within the three reforms that will be exemplified, this essay argues that <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Bank</b> remains more concerned with pushing its own neo-liberal agenda than taking a hard stance on deep-rooted corruption and has therefore failed to make significant progress on the fight against corruption...|$|R

25|$|Stiglitz wrote {{a series}} of papers and held {{a series of}} {{conferences}} explaining how such information uncertainties may have influence on everything from unemployment to lending shortages. As the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the first term of the Clinton Administration and former chief economist <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Bank,</b> Stiglitz was able to put some of his views into action. For example, he was an outspoken critic of quickly opening up financial markets in developing countries. These markets rely on access to good financial data and sound bankruptcy laws, but he argued that many of these countries didn't have the regulatory institutions needed to ensure that the markets would operate soundly.|$|E
