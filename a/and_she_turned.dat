25|$|Despite his prosperity, Svarocis {{was unhappy}} {{in his life}} and could hear the ducks and deer talking about him behind his back. One day he went hunting and took aim at a boar, but a deer came through the {{clearing}} and asked to be shot in its place. When he enquired why, the deer told him that she was really the goddess of the forest and wished to marry Svarocisa. So he embraced the deer <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> into a beautiful woman. Together, they had a son named Dyutiman, who later became the Svarocisa Manu.|$|E
25|$|Sewall's work in {{establishing}} the National Council of Women in the United States led to her involvement in founding the General Federation of Women's Clubs. The federation's constitution was ratified in 1890. Sewall attended its first organizational meeting in February 1891, and helped to write its bylaws, but she was disappointed when the new organization decided not to join the National Council of Women. After serving as the first vice-president of the federation, her interest in the group gradually declined, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> her efforts toward the National Council of Women and other reform issues. U.S. President William McKinley appointed Sewall as U.S. representative of women to the Exposition Universelle (1900) in Paris.|$|E

500|$|Almost {{blind and}} unable to {{effectively}} fire her main and secondary armament, South Dakota was illuminated by searchlights and targeted by gunfire and torpedoes {{by most of the}} ships of the Japanese force, including Kirishima, beginning around midnight on 15 November. Although able to score a few hits on Kirishima, South Dakota took 26 hits—some of which did not explode—that completely knocked out her communications and remaining gunfire control operations, set portions of her upper decks on fire, and forced her to try to steer away from the engagement. All of the Japanese torpedoes missed. Admiral Lee later described the cumulative effect of the gunfire damage to South Dakota as to, [...] "render one of our new battleships deaf, dumb, blind, and impotent." [...] South Dakotas crew casualties were 39killed and 59wounded, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> away from the battle at 00:17 without informing Admiral Lee, though observed by Kondo's lookouts.|$|E
500|$|Fox Mulder and Dana Scully {{arrive in}} Connerville, where Hammond {{is the latest}} of five men who have died due to lightning-related causes. Upon visiting the arcade, Scully talks to Bart [...] "Zero" [...] Liquori, the arcade owner (and a friend of Oswald's) who {{happened}} to be present the night Hammond died. Mulder finds Oswald's high scores on the game's display, realizing that he was playing on the night Hammond died; Oswald {{was the first of the}} victims, and the only one to have survived. Elsewhere, Oswald is at work at an automobile repair shop when his boss's wife, Sharon Kiveat, walks in. He then tries talking to her, but she nervously rebuffs him; it is revealed that he had hit on her the day before, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> him down. His boss returns and tells Oswald that Mulder and Scully want to talk with him. When the agents visit Oswald to question him, he claims to have not witnessed anything. However, Mulder's cell phone mysteriously overheats in Oswald's presence, to which Oswald acts unsurprised.|$|E
500|$|After {{expanding}} the dairy herd in May 2004, David and Ruth hired specialist herdsman Sam Batton (Robin Pirongs). Ruth frequently {{came into contact}} with Sam around the farm and he confided in Ruth about his relationship with Kirsty Miller (Annabelle Dowler). Ruth found herself becoming jealous when Sam went on holiday with Kirsty. In their book, The Archers Archives, Simon Frith and Chris Arnot commented that the [...] "simmering mix of sexual chemistry" [...] between Ruth and Sam reached boiling point when David's ex-girlfriend, Sophie Barlow, returned to Ambridge and asked David to help organise a charity fashion show. Ruth became stressed and insecure about David spending time with his ex-girlfriend <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> to Sam. The main reason for Ruth's insecurity was her image, as she had recently undergone a mastectomy and felt [...] "dowdy" [...] next to Sophie. Ruth became emotionally confused when Sam informed her that he had broken up with Kirsty. She then caught David lying about meeting up with Sophie and believed he was having an affair. Unbeknownst to Ruth, Sophie had tried to entice David into an affair, but he resisted her advances.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{eventually}} {{learned to}} take care of herself and her siblings, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> to her paternal grandmother in the hope of finding some solace and some form of her mother in her. The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and invariably rebelled against anyone brought into their home ostensibly {{to take the place of}} their beloved mother. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Madonna commented that she saw herself in her youth as a [...] "lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didn't shave my underarms and I didn't wear make-up like normal girls do. But I studied and I got good grades.... I wanted to be somebody." [...] Terrified that her father, Tony Ciccone, could be taken from her as well, Madonna was often unable to sleep unless she was near him. Two years after her mother's death, her father married the family's housekeeper, Joan Gustafson. At this point, Madonna began to express unresolved feelings of anger towards her father that lasted for decades, and developed a rebellious attitude. She explained in the May 1989 issue of Interview magazine: ...|$|E

No other producers offered the young Courtneidge leading roles in musical comedies, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> instead to the music hall, learning her craft as a comedian. [...] In 1916 she married the actor and dancer Jack Hulbert, with whom she formed a professional as well as a private partnership that lasted until his death 62 years later. They acted together on stage and screen, initially in a series of revues, with Hulbert frequently producing as well as performing.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{her return}} to Perth in July DeMarchi {{contacted}} former bandmate Celenza {{to form a new}} band in Sydney. He was initially reluctant to go but recommended another former bandmate, Parise. In Sydney, DeMarchi approached her then-manager, John Woodruff (The Angels, Diesel [...] ), who signed the new group and referred Leslie to her. Celenza then officially joined. Woodruff later recalled [...] "I'd seen [...] in London performing some bad Stock Aitken and Waterman tunes on television late one night. I found her <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> out to be Australian. She also turned out {{to have a lot of}} attitude. I brought her back to Australia and put a band together around her." ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 29, 1898, the City of Ainsworth left Nelson for Bonner's Ferry and {{was caught}} in a gale force storm. Loaded down with eight cords of wood on her bow, she began to founder. Passengers and crew were quick to throw the {{firewood}} overboard, but then the water rushed down onto her stern <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> broadside and began to roll in the waves. At one point she rolled over so far that water rushed into her smokestack. The first officer put down one of the two lifeboats, but as soon as five people got in it, it was swamped and four of them were lost in the waves. The second lifeboat was launched with worse results, and another five people were lost.|$|E
2500|$|She had a {{difficult}} childhood marked by illness and tantrums. [...] In 1863, while her father was Viceroy of Poland, [...] she was given away to be raised by her childless uncle and aunt, King Karl and Queen Olga of Württemberg. Vera's condition improved in their home and she outgrew her disruptive behavior. In 1871 she was legally adopted by Karl and Olga, who arranged her marriage in 1874 to Duke Eugen of Württemberg (1846–1877), {{a member of the}} Silesian ducal branch of the family. Her husband died suddenly three years later. Vera, only twenty-three years old, did not remarry, dedicating herself to her twin daughters. At the death of King Karl in 1891, Vera inherited a considerable fortune <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> her home into a cultural gathering place. She was a popular figure in Württemberg, notable for her charitable work.|$|E
2500|$|Erica is a headstrong {{and selfish}} 15-year-old when All My Children begins in 1970. Although Nixon {{designed}} her {{as one of}} the bad characters, she was not intended to come off as evil or menacing. Since Nixon created All My Children as a [...] "light hearted" [...] soap opera, the series' villains, Erica included, came across as more fun and funny, than wicked. Over time, Erica evolved into a [...] "heroine-vixen" [...] who still did bad things, but was also a character the audience rooted for. Former associate producer Felicia Minei Behr said, [...] "The Erica that [...] started with, was a kid who was one-dimensional, who was the rotten seed, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> her into a very fascinating character- the character that everybody loves to hate." [...] Characterized as the [...] "naughty girl in town" [...] from the start, her motivations stem from her relationship with her father. Her abandonment by him led her to be written as sexually aggressive with men. She needs to receive love from men to prove she is not unlovable.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the long}} fourth reading ( [...] , aliyah), the angel {{replied that he}} would grant Lot this favor too, and spare that town. The angel urged Lot to hurry there, for the angel could not do {{anything}} until he arrived there, and thus the town {{came to be called}} Zoar. As the sun rose and Lot entered Zoar, God rained sulfurous fire from heaven on Sodom and Gomorrah and annihilated the entire plain. Lot's wife looked back, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> into a pillar of salt. Next morning, Abraham hurried to the place where he had stood before God and looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and saw the smoke rising like at a kiln. Lot was afraid to dwell in Zoar, so he settled in a cave in the hill country with his two daughters. The older daughter told the younger that their father was old, and there was not a man on earth with whom to have children, so she proposed that they get Lot drunk and have sex with him so that they might maintain life through their father. That night they made their father drink wine, and the older one lay with her father without his being aware. And the next day the older one persuaded the younger to do the same. The two daughters thus had children by their father, the older one bore a son named Moab who became the father of the Moabites, and the younger bore a son named Ben-ammi who became the father of the Ammonites.
