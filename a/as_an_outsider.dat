5|$|Already as a teenager, Sorabji {{took great}} {{interest}} in recent developments in art music—in the work of Schoenberg, Scriabin, Mahler and Debussy, among others—at {{a time when they}} received scant attention in the United Kingdom. This interest, along with his ethnicity, cemented his reputation <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>outsider.</b> He and his music had their detractors, but some musicians received his work positively: Frederick Delius, who heard a 1930 radio broadcast of Sorabji playing his own piece Le jardin parfumé: Poem for Piano Solo, sent a letter of admiration to Sorabji; the French–Swiss pianist Alfred Cortot expressed interest in performing Sorabji's piano concertos; and Alban Berg reportedly took an interest in Sorabji's music.|$|E
5|$|His parents imbue {{him with}} a strong moral compass during his {{formative}} years and warn him never to use his great strength in anger. However, during kindergarten, Danner nearly kills the school's bully in a one-sided fight after being assaulted by the child. This event brands him <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>outsider</b> {{in the eyes of}} the other children. Because they treat him with such abhorrence, his only solace comes in the form of unleashing his powers within the Colorado wilderness (uprooting trees, throwing huge boulders, leaping to the mountain tops, etc.). This stigma eventually wears off, though, and is forgotten by the time Danner enters high school.|$|E
5|$|Hope {{had been}} offered {{a leading role in}} Stanley Kubrick's war film, Full Metal Jacket, when he was offered the role of Gorman. He interacted with the other film's cast and crew, since both were shot near the Battersea Power Station in Nine Elms. The cast who played Colonial Marines (except latecomer Michael Biehn) {{underwent}} several weeks of training with United States Marines without Hope. Director James Cameron said that he wanted Hope separated so he would be seen <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>outsider,</b> complementing Gorman's onscreen inexperience.|$|E

50|$|Palin also skillfully navigated {{the double}} bind, showing herself <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tough {{political}} <b>outsider</b> and <b>a</b> family woman. Palin criticized Obama and reiterated her image <b>as</b> <b>a</b> regular hockey mom, not a career politician. Palin's emphasis on her position <b>as</b> <b>a</b> political <b>outsider</b> helped her gain {{the trust of}} the people and convinced them that she could be a possible agent of political change—a belief Clinton could not seem to convey to many of her opponents. However, Palin's position <b>as</b> <b>a</b> political <b>outsider</b> backfired on her and revealed her actual lack of qualifications for the office.|$|R

5|$|Suzuki's working {{title for}} this second {{autobiography}} was The Outsider, a title intended {{to express the}} author's view of his own role in society. The origin of this outsider feeling comes from isolation suffered at a Japanese Canadian internment camp during World War II. He was imprisoned there for being Japanese but shunned by other Japanese for being a third generation Canadian, speaking only English. His feeling of isolation continued during his early school years when the only other student of Japanese heritage was his twin sister. Suzuki's daughters acknowledged this perception of himself <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>outsider</b> but insist that the public views him very differently, {{as one of their}} own, leading to the simple The Autobiography title.|$|E
5|$|Jasper Sharp {{points out}} that the Japanese and western views of Takechi's legacy are quite different. While western sources assess him as a major figure in the early {{development}} of the pink film, many current Japanese sources on the subject ignore his work. Sharp notes, however, that during his lifetime, he was covered prominently in Japanese sources. He speculates that his legacy has been largely forgotten in his homeland partly because of his status <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>outsider</b> in the Japanese film communities—both mainstream and pink. Since his films were self-produced and distributed by major film companies rather than through the eroduction circuit, they are not technically pink films. Also, his right-wing political background conflicts with the generally revolutionary stance more often associated with the pink film. Since his death in 1988, the lack of a studio or other publicist, or coverage by writers on the pink film has kept his work out of the public's eye in Japan. In the west, however, some of Takechi's films, such as Daydream were shown during their first runs, reviewed by major publications such as Variety, and have been preserved and remained available to genre audiences on home video releases.|$|E
5|$|The locals saw Meiklejohn <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>outsider.</b> He was {{foreign to}} Madison in his politics, social life, and personality. Dean Sellery and President Frank's {{professional}} relationship was untrusting and contemptuous, which extended to Meiklejohn {{due to his}} close association with Frank. Sellery {{had the support of}} the faculty, who were envious of the Experimental College advisers' arrangements for higher salaries. In objection to the college's reputation for radicalism, the son of the man who endowed Meiklejohn's professorship revoked his funding. Frank needed the donor's support, and so the incident marked Frank's waning support for the college. Sellery spoke out against the Experimental College {{in the first quarter of}} 1929, and Frank attempted to fire him in response. In 1931, Sellery received letters from spies who found Meiklejohn's son Donald, a philosophy doctoral student at the university and a part-time Experimental College adviser, engaged in sex acts against university policy. Sellery pursued expulsion and denied Meiklejohn and his son's separate requests for a lesser punishment. A week later, Meiklejohn asked the advisers to close the college.|$|E

25|$|Aspin {{was elected}} as a Democrat to the 92nd {{and to the}} 11 {{succeeding}} Congresses and served from January 3, 1971, until his resignation January 20, 1993. Aspin began {{his career in the}} United States House of Representatives <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>outsider</b> but honed his particular interest and expertise in defense matters. Before and during his tenure in the House, he had opposed the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.|$|E
25|$|References to Mercia and the Mercians {{continue}} through the annals recording the reigns of Æthelstan and his successors. Æthelstan himself {{was raised in}} Mercia and became its king before he was king of Wessex. In Winchester, there was even an attempt to blind Æthelstan as he was seen <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>outsider.</b> In 975, King Edgar is described as “friend of the West Saxons and protector of the Mercians”.|$|E

25|$|Before his marriage, Prince Henry´s {{greatest}} ambition was to someday command his regiment, the 10th Royal Hussars, or {{at least}} {{spend as much time}} in the army as possible. Although he was a capable soldier, as the King's son he was prevented from joining his regiment abroad, and this meant he was generally seen <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>outsider</b> to his fellow officers. To his increasing despair, he had to fulfill the many royal duties his father assigned him.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{required}} to move through every rank below to achieve a higher rank. For example, many officers promote directly to sergeant without ever being senior officers. Also, many assistant chiefs are promoted directly from the rank of lieutenant. Councilman C.O. Bradford was promoted to assistant chief from the rank of sergeant. Jack Heard was promoted to chief from the rank of sergeant. It is entirely possible to become chief <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>outsider</b> such {{as in the case of}} Lee Brown, who went on to become mayor, and Harold Hurtt.|$|E
25|$|When Jimmy Carter {{entered the}} Democratic Party Presidential {{primaries}} in 1976, he at first {{was considered to}} have little chance against nationally better-known politicians. However, the Watergate scandal was still fresh in the voters' minds, and so his position <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>outsider</b> distant from Washington, D.C. became an asset. He ran an effective campaign, did well in debates, and won his party's nomination and then the election, receiving 50.1% of the popular vote. The centerpiece of his campaign platform was government reorganization. Carter was the first candidate from the Deep South to be elected president since Antebellum.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, Maus {{left his}} {{hometown}} of Austin, Minnesota to study experimental music at the California Institute of the Arts. When he befriended and began to work alongside classmate Ariel Rosenberg (Ariel Pink), he took a greater interest in pop music. Much of his initial lo-fi work was created using a cassette multi-track recorder and an early 1990s synthesizer soundbank. It {{was not until the}} success of his third album, We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves (2011), that he grew more widely accepted <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>outsider</b> artist. On stage, he is known for his intense displays of emotion while performing.|$|E
25|$|In September 2004, Forfang {{announced}} {{his plans to}} establish himself among the world elite. On the same day he finished eighth in a Summer Grand Prix meet in Zakopane, with a new hill record of 139.5 metres. He then won the next two Grand Prix events, and was subsequently promoted to the Norwegian national team. He then won the next two Grand Prix events, and was tipped by some <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>outsider</b> to win the entire World Cup. In November he secured sponsorship money from twenty companies in his local Troms. He had previously worked odd part-time jobs parallel to training. Forfang also signed a deal with ski provider Rossignol.|$|E
25|$|Franky Fitzgerald (Dakota Blue Richards) is seen <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>outsider,</b> having {{arrived to}} her first year at Roundview three weeks late upon moving to Bristol from Oxford. She is an {{intelligent}} and creative girl, but is seen by others as strange, and is ostracised largely due to her androgynous dress sense. Alo Creevey (Will Merrick), something of an optimist, loves his dog and his van foremost. He is best friends with Rich Hardbeck (Alex Arnold), a boy from a very middle-class home who immerses himself in heavy metal subculture. He uses musical elitism {{as a means to}} cover up his own shyness when, among other things, interacting with girls.|$|E

25|$|Late in 1892, Caragiale {{published}} {{two volumes}} of prose, including his new novellas Păcat, O făclie de Paşte and Om cu noroc. The following year, he began frequenting socialist circles <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>outsider</b> to the cause, and soon became {{good friends with}} the Imperial Russian-born Marxist thinker Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea. Financial constraints forced Caragiale to become an entrepreneur, and, in November of that year, opened a beer garden near Gabroveni Inn, in Bucharest's Lipscani area. He probably moved on soon after, and purchased a pub on a neighboring street. In a letter he wrote at the time, the writer showed that {{he was planning to}} move to Transylvania, and considered starting a career as a teacher.|$|E
25|$|Pawlenty {{oversaw the}} repeal of the Profile of Learning Kindergarten through 12th grade {{graduation}} requirements and sought to reinstate them during his governorship. Renamed the Minnesota Academic Standards, they were guided by Department of Education commissioner Cheri Pierson Yecke. The bill's first draft raised several concerns by the education review boards including the amount of content, age-appropriateness, and a European-centric view of the social sciences portion. Yecke revised and expanded material based on the response. Even as both Legislative houses passed the Academic Standards bill, her confirmation as commissioner was rejected by the DFL majority Minnesota Senate. She was seen <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>outsider</b> coming from Virginia and became unpopular for having pushed the academic reforms during a tight budget session as well as her critical look of Minnesota schools. In her confirmation hearing, DFLers also noted concern over her conservative viewpoints.|$|E
25|$|In October, he {{was named}} prefect of Brăila County, a job which he took because his wife's declining health {{required}} advanced medical services. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>outsider,</b> he was asked by Catargiu to audit the local Conservative chapter, to the annoyance of a junior party leader, Nicolae Filipescu. Filipescu turned to sabotaging Rosetti's work; the latter contacted Bianu and, through him, PNL chairman Dimitrie Sturdza, to help him appoint a bipartisan council of reputable men. When news of this attempted partnership broke nationally, the Conservatives were irritated. After another series of challenges, including the cholera pandemic (eventually handled by Iacob Felix), Danube floods, and dockers' strikes, Rosetti moved on to a similar position in Bacău County in October 1893. He inaugurated an anti-corruption campaign and various public works, but also appealed to nepotism, such as when he ensured the victory of his protege, G. I. Donici, in the by-election for the Assembly. By April 1894, PNL agitators instigated the peasants against Conservative tax reforms, causing riots in Ardeoani and Răcăciuni. Voices {{in his own party}} called Rosetti responsible for the 17 wounded Gendarmes and the unknown of number of peasants brutalized during retaliations.|$|E
