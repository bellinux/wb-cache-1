The goal of thispaper is to present a study over the existing literature on face <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> detection <b>and</b> gaze estimation. Withthe uptrend of systems based on face <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> detection in many different areas of life in recent years, thissubject has gained much more attention by academic and industrial area. Many different studies havebeen performed about face <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> detection. Besides having many challenging problems like, havingdifferent lighting conditions, having glasses, facial hair or mustache on face, different orientation pose orocclusion of face, face <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> detection methods performed great progress. In this paper we firstcategorize face detection models and examine the basic algorithms for face detection. Then we presentmethods for <b>eye</b> detection <b>and</b> gaze estimation...|$|R
40|$|Head <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> {{movements}} were simultaneously recorded during locomotory and pecking behavior of 4 pigeons (CoLumba Livia), which {{were trained to}} traverse a conditioning chamber, with a pecking key and a food dispenser at each end. Each trial involved key pecking, walking, and feeding. Head {{movements were}} registered with a skull-mounted miniature accelerometer, <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> movements were recorded with implanted electrooculographic electrodes. An almost perfect tem-poral coordination between head <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> movements was observed during both walking and feeding bouts. During walking, head movements primarily provide retinal image stability, <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> movements support visual scanning. During feeding, head movements mainly subserve the grasp-ing of food items, <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> movements maintain visual fixation on them. Because the eyes are reflexively closed during the middle phase of pecks, the head <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> movements are then under ballistic control. The peculiar saltatory head motions that many birds ex-hibit while they walk have repeatedly attracted interest in the past. As early as 1930, Dunlap and Mowrer reported that although the body of locomoting chickens, pigeons, and star...|$|R

5|$|Although {{ytterbium}} {{is fairly}} stable chemically, it {{is stored in}} airtight containers and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen-filled dry box {{to protect it from}} air and moisture. All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic, although studies appear to indicate that the danger is minimal. However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin <b>and</b> <b>eyes,</b> and some might be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|E

Young birds spend about a year in juvenile plumage before moulting into adult plumage at around a year old. Juvenile birds have more brown-tinged and uniform plumage; the darker colour around the lores <b>and</b> <b>eyes</b> are less distinct. Their blackish bill is yellow-tipped, and the gape is yellow. Their eyes are brownish, but turn yellow early. The exact timing is unknown but likely to be around four months of age.|$|E

It was felt that it was not possible for a garment to receive such damage without damage to the hook <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> fastening, thus indicating that the complainant caused the damage to the bra herself to support a false allegation. Reconstruction experiments were conducted in which the conditions of the allegation were simulated utilizing a range of similar bras. Following the infliction of damage, the hook <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> fastenings were examined. In eight of nine experiments, the hook <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> fastening were intact, despite the application of enough force to cause separation of the bra cups in five of the experiments.

Capcom added detail to the zombie enemies unprecedented in the series, such as making their jaws move <b>and</b> <b>eyes</b> twitch. Claire {{was given a}} tougher appearance in Code: Veronica than in Resident Evil 2, the reason being her experiences in Resident Evil 2 built her toughness and confidence to handle any situation. This characterization is emphasized by her ability to dual wield sub-machine guns, and also by the opening cinematic which features her in a John Woo-inspired action scene. Mikami described Code: Veronica as 50-60% of his perfect vision for Resident Evil in February 2001, and he cited that future Resident Evil projects may make up the other half.|$|E

Most important is to capture the look of the celebrity to reflect the personality of each unique individual. The next task is to make a clay model of the head and body which is used to create a mould. Wax cast of the head and hands are made from the mould, and the eyes are inserted. Each eye is hand-painted to achieve a perfect match of the original. Real human hair is then inserted painstakingly strand by strand.|$|E
5|$|In the {{anthropomorphic}} form, Varaha {{often has}} a stylized boar face, like the zoomorphic models. The snout may be shorter. The position {{and size of}} the tusks may also be altered. The ears, cheeks <b>and</b> <b>eyes</b> are generally based on human ones. Early sculptors in Udayagiri and Eran faced the issue of how to attach the boar head to the human body and did not show a human neck. However, in Badami, the problem was resolved by including a human neck. While some sculptures show a mane, it is dropped and replaced by a high conical crown - typical of Vishnu iconography - in others. Varaha sculptures generally look up to the right; there are very rare instances of left-facing Varaha depictions.|$|E

40|$|A virtual avatar or {{autonomous}} agent is a digital {{representation of a}} human being that can be controlled by either a human or an artificially intelligent computer system. Increasingly avatars are becoming realistic virtual human characters that exhibit human behavioral traits, body language <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> head movements. As the interpretation of <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> head movements represents an important part of nonverbal human communication it is extremely important to accurately reproduce these movements in virtual avatars to avoid falling into the well-known "uncanny valley 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7.

The autopsy scene involved McCrane positioning himself through a hole in the table and sitting perfectly still, giving the illusion of a disembodied head. The scene in the bathtub required McCrane to spend several minutes motionless underwater. The shot in which a new Betts emerges from the old one's mouth was created by Toby Lindala. Lindala used shots of McCrane intercut with shots of a puppet with full-functioning mouth <b>and</b> <b>eyes.</b> Laverne Basham and Lindala were later both nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Makeup in a Series.

Her head <b>and</b> <b>eyes</b> are disproportionately large, she has adolescent breasts, while the aperture {{at the back}} of her head resembles a vaginal orifice. She holds a wolf cub to her hip, a symbol of her indifference and wild power. It is not clear whether Oviri is smothering or hugging the cub, but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice, infanticide and the archetype of the vengeful mother, influenced by Eugène Delacroix's 1838 painting, Medea About to Kill Her Children. A second animal, likely another wolf, is at her feet either curling in submission or dead. Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin.|$|E
5|$|Petit Ferret {{developed}} Popotan in 2002. Seki Hayabusa and Iwashinichi Shimizu handled scenario development, and Akio Watanabe designed its characters {{while working}} under the alias Poyoyon♥Rock. Higuchi Hideki and Kajihara Masahiro composed music for the series; Under17 contributed theme music with vocals. Petite Ferret created over 1,000 two-dimensional computer graphics for backgrounds, events, and character poses. Though only characters' mouths <b>and</b> <b>eyes</b> are animated, numerous poses exist for both major and minor characters; Petit Ferret created slightly fewer graphics for the latter to reduce production costs. The game uses a character placement system to display the characters relative to the protagonist; distant characters appear small, and grow larger as the player approaches them.|$|E
