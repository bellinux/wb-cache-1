Here, the founder effect causes rapid speciation after an increase in inbreeding increases selection on homozygotes, leading to rapid genetic change.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Land is a 1989 side-scrolling {{platform}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Nintendo as a launch title for their Game Boy handheld game console. It is the first Mario platform game ever to be released for a handheld console. In gameplay {{similar to that of}} the 1985 Super Mario Bros., but resized for the smaller device's screen, the player advances Mario to the end of 12 levels by moving to the right and jumping across platforms to avoid enemies and pitfalls. Unlike other Mario games, Super Mario Land is set in Sarasaland, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>environment</b> depicted in line art, and Mario pursues Princess Daisy (who makes her debut in this game). The game introduces two Gradius-style shooter levels.|$|E

Aggression between males often occurs to secure mating opportunities, and results in selection of the healthier/more vigorous animal.

25|$|Joseon {{architecture}} {{is defined as}} from the 14th century {{to the beginning of}} 20th century. The founding of the Joseon Dynasty in 1392 brought to power like-minded men steeped in the doctrines of Neo-Confucianism, which had slowly percolated into Korea from China in the 14th century. This ushered in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>environment</b> that was relatively hostile to Buddhism, causing the state to gradually shift its patronage from Buddhist temples to Confucian institutions. Throughout the early dynasty, the impetus to reform society along Neo-Confucian lines led to the construction of hyanggyo (local schools) in Seoul and numerous provincial cities. Here, sons of the aristocracy prepared for civil service careers in an atmosphere of Confucian learning. Although these institutions endured {{through the end of the}} dynasty, they began to fall out of favor in the mid-16th century for a variety of reasons. Among these, the rise in population made it the prospects of a civil service career less likely than in earlier years. Also, as the yangban aristocracy matured in its understanding of Neo-Confucianism, they grew more selective in the quality and type of instruction they favored for their sons. As a result, private Confucian academies (seowon) gradually supplanted hyanggyos and became a staple of rural aristocratic life until the end of the dynasty.|$|E

25|$|The flower corolla {{consists}} of solitary actinomorphic, white flowers with five petals that most resemble the flowers of Forstera and Phyllachne (both also in Stylidiaceae). Like all Stylidium species, O. subulatum also possesses a column, {{which is the}} fused stamens and stigma. But unlike Stylidium species, it is insensitive or non-mobile and does not move in response to physical stimuli. It {{has been suggested that}} Oreostylidium be merged into the genus Stylidium, but the morphological characteristics of the two genera are dissimilar. Researchers have suggested that the floral form O. subulatum had developed by an extreme example of paedomorphosis or reduction. This process may have begun as a result of O. subulatums isolation on the islands of New Zealand. Researchers believe that this species has its origins in Australia and was established in New Zealand by a very small population and perhaps from a single seed. Faced with survival in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>environment</b> and possessing a flower designed for specific Australian pollinators, the species underwent rapid changes to its morphology. The hypothesis presented in these studies suggests this is how O. subulatum evolved from a common ancestry lineage with Stylidium graminifolium into the pollinator-generalist it is today. There is also a shift from the Stylidium-like flower designed for cross-pollination to obligate autogamous pollination. This allowed the plant to perform sexual reproduction in its morphologically immature state because the complicated Stylidium-like flowers were not required for pollination.|$|E
