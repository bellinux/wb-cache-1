And because the London people are roaring about for some pinches of their own, he thinks to win them to his turn with a wet finger. And he gets encouragement from some, because they want a spell of money from him; and from others, because they fought for the cause once and are ashamed to go back; and others, because they have nothing to lose; and others, because they are discontented fools. But if he has brought you, or any one, I say not whom, into this scrape, with the hope of doing any good, he's a d--d decoy-duck, and that's all I can say for him; and you are geese, which is worse than being decoy-ducks, or lame-ducks either.

5000|$|Ezra Klein {{wrote in}} August 2011: [...] "What distinguishes crises {{like this one}} from typical recessions is {{household}} debt. When the financial markets collapsed, household debt was nearly 100 percent of GDP. It’s now down to 90 percent. In 1982, which {{was the last time}} we had a big recession, the household-debt-to-GDP ratio was about 45 percent. That means that in this crisis, indebted households can’t spend, which means businesses can’t spend, which means that unless government steps into the breach in a massive way or until households work through their debt burden, we can’t recover. In the 1982 recession, households could spend, and so when the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates and made spending attractive, we accelerated out of the recession. The utility of calling this downturn a “household-debt crisis” is it tells you where to put your focus: you either need to make consumers better able to pay their debts, which you can do through conventional stimulus policy like tax cuts and jobs programs, or you need to make their debts smaller so they’re better able to pay them, which you can do by forgiving some of their debt through policies like principal reduction or eroding the value of their debt by increasing inflation. I’ve heard various economist make various smart points <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> should prefer one approach or the other, and it also happens to be the case that the two policies support each other and so we don’t actually need to choose between them. All of these solutions, of course, have drawbacks: if you put the government deeper into debt in order to help households now, you increase the risk of a public-debt crisis later. That’s why it’s wise to pair further short-term stimulus with a large amount of long-term deficit reduction. If you force banks to swallow losses or face inflation now, you need to worry about whether they’ll be able to keep lending at a pace that will support recovery over the next few years. But as we’re seeing, not doing enough isn’t a safe strategy, either." ...|$|E

5000|$|The hero of {{the film}} is a Moslem woman [...] "Atossa", played by Taies Farzan who starts the whole story based on her {{promises}} to her brother. Daryush Shokof suggested in an interview after the film that he specifically wanted to show the important role of women in Iranian society and how he admires their courage and honesty.Shokof intends to show how he feels about Iranian women and their ability to free Iranians from under the fundamentalist Islamic regime that has governed the Iranian nation for over 37 years now.Therefore his hero is a woman, and it is the woman who promises a word and keeps it, and delivers it rather than a man in an all too male and macho oriented religious society and government that he believes has brutally dictated backwards rules upon Iranians that have in his opinio taken Iranians back to the dark ages of religious fanatacism.The {{hero of the}} film is Atossa who is the sister of the dying brother making two idealistically rare and odd and strange and hopeful promises.She sets out to travel to Berlin, Germany to first find the grave of Hitler who all believe does not exist and then to make the situation more round she continues with the second promise that remains a mystery until the final moment of the film.Atossa is passionate, sincere, daring, powerful and a well trained fighter ( [...] we see her fighting masterfully in a training in the first moments of the film where another fighting trainee tells her about the grave situation of her brother,s fate).She encounters many unfortunate typical encounters on the streets of Berlin to finally finding the Rabbi played by the great German actor Vadim Glowna who suggests to her a sight where Hitler could be buried under.However, he also tells her the truth about the nature of many mysteries throughout the history of mankind while explaining to her that we human being adore mysteries and there are some amongst us that are masters at creating stories and mysteries from who the prophets were to how Marilyn Monroe died and or who really killed Kennedy or whatever suddenly happened to Michael Jackson on the same eve of the day where Iranian regime was almost about to fall?!The plot suggests many clever details and secretive and thought provoking questions <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> all somehow are victims but keeps the audience awake by simplicity of the story and how it progresses as it sticks to her pursuit of finding the solution to her second promise.After she finds out the presumably the grave spot of Hitler,she is now overjoyed, convinced, and is positively motivated to continue her mission in order to deliver the second promise. She arrives at her hotel room to rest a while, turns on the T.V. screen and is shocked to see the shooting death of Neda, the innocent Iranian student during the protests on the streets of Tehran. The horrifying pictures of the final dying moments of Neda takes her by storm.Here the film takes the daring turn to free Atossa from the grip of religion fanaticism over her life as she runs out of the hotel in a fury and runs aimlessly to mere exhaustion. There and finally she walks over the bridge where the wide calm rivers flow heavy under the bridge.There she finally takes the mandatory scarf off her head and throws it into the river as it disappears into the deep waters. Now she feels free again for once after being out of the country, and starts walking through the streets of Berlin, goes to dance alone in a club , gets drunk and is saved from being attacked by drunk wild men in the club by the hotel keeper who has a feeling for her ever since the first minute she arrived in the hotel.She battles Nazis, beats the life out of two low life city slickers masterfully who wanted to take her for a ride and show her a fake grave plot as the spot where Hitler's grave is supposed to be.At the police station she encounters similarities between all establishments on Earth where the police distrust her and set out a detective to watch every move she makes from this point on. The detective [...] "Karlsson" [...] who is commissioned to watch after everything she does from her second day of her arrival in the city is always on her tails until he finally is the witness to a most moving final moments between Atossa and Lars in the last scene of the film.
