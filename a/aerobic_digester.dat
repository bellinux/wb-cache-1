In this work, an innovative free nitrous acid (HNO 2 or FNA) -based pretreatment approach is proposed to improve full-scale ADS degradation in post <b>aerobic</b> <b>digester.</b> The post {{aerobic digestion}} was conducted by using an activated sludge to aerobically digest ADS for 4 days. Degradations of the FNA-treated (treated at 1. 0 and 2. 0 mg N/L for 24 h) and untreated ADS 5 were then determined and compared. The ADS was degraded by 26 % and 32 %, respectively, in the 4 -day post aerobic digestion period while being pretreated at 1. 0 and 2. 0 mg HNO 2 N/L. In comparison, only 20 % of the untreated ADS was degraded. Economic analysis demonstrated that the implementation of FNA pretreatment can be economically favourable or not depending on the sludge transport and disposal cost. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The degradation of five pharmaceuticals and personal care products, tetracycline, triclosan, tylosin, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim was examined. The photolysis of these compounds was studied in pure water, {{wastewater treatment plant}} effluent, and natural waters. The biodegradation of the substances, excluding tetracycline, was examined during both aerobic and anaerobic sludge digestion. Tetracycline, triclosan, and tylosin were shown to degrade rapidly under both natural and simulated sunlight. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim did not photodegrade as rapidly as the other compounds. These two compounds, however, did degrade more quickly in wastewater treatment plant effluent than in pure water or natural water. This observation indicated indirect photolysis was an important loss process for these compounds in the effluent. The cause of indirect photolysis was shown to be both triplet-excited dissolved organic matter and hydroxyl radicals reacting with the sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim.

40|$|Introduction. Sludge {{is a broad}} {{term used}} to {{describe}} the various aqueous suspensions of solids produced during wastewater treatment. Raw sludge can be broadly classified as primary sludge, secondary sludge and mixed sludge (mixtures of these two sludge). Raw sludge contains a variety of pollutants creating potentials for environmental pollution and must be treated and disposed properly. Sludge produced in Isfahan South Wastewater Treatment Plant is treated by anaerobic digestion. This method generates nuisance odors and has many operational problems. &# 13; Aerobic digestion is an alternative process for stabilizing sludge. Because the operational control of <b>aerobic</b> <b>digesters</b> is simple and many other advantages, it appears that aerobic digestion will increase in popularity. &# 13; Methods. Aerobic digestion was carried out in a 7. 5 liters bioreactor (rectangular glass tank 23 * 16 * 21 Cm) that was loaded with 5 liters mixed sludge from this plant. This experimental research was conducted at the Environmental Health Laboratory of Isfahan Faculty of Health. Aeration of bioreactor content provided through three air stones that each of them connected with one aquarium air pump (RENA 101). The aeration rate was set to maintain a minimum residual dissolved oxygen concentration of 1. 5 mg/I and aeration was sufficient to keep the solids in suspension. This research was continued for 5 period from autumn and winter 1998 through end of spring 1999. In each period the sludge was aerated for three weeks and in each week two times samplings are accomplished and were analyzed. &# 13; Results. The measurements of TS, TSS, TVS, VSS, and COD concentration and percent reduction of them were performed to monitor the progress of aerobic digestion process and determination of design parameters. Standard Methods (APHA, 1992) were used for all analytical procedures. After the 18 days of detention time of aerobic digestion the decrease in TS, TSS, TVS. VSS, and COD reached 45. 22, 49. 30, 52. 36, 52. 28, and 43. 03 percent respectively of its primary value. &# 13; Discussion. The results of this study were shown that mixed sludge from Isfahan South Wastewater Treatment Plant were stabilized effectively by aerobic digestion and during of these process significant decreases in any form solids and organic matters were occurred. Determining endpoints in digestion of sludge is carried out by determining the TVS reduction. A 40 percent TVS reduction (EPA's regulations) was achieved with a minimum hydraulic detention time of 11 days at maximum TVS loading rate of 1. 45 KgTVsm- 3 d- 1...|$|R

Three different ozone flow rates were tested (60, 500 and 670 g O- 3 h(- 1)) and their effects evaluated in terms of variation of the total and soluble fractions of COD, nitrogen and phosphorous, of total and volatile suspended solids concentrations and Sludge Volume Index in the aerobic digestion unit. During the 7 -month operation of the ozonation process, it was observed an appreciable improvement of the aerobic digestion efficiency (up to about 20 % under the optimal conditions) and of the sludge settleability properties. These results determined an average reduction of about 60 % in the biological sludge extracted from the plant and delivered to final disposal. A thorough economic analysis showed that this reduction allowed to achieve a significant cost saving for the plant with respect to the previous years operated without ozonation. Furthermore, it was determined the threshold disposal cost above which implementation of the ozone oxidation in the aerobic digestion units of similar WWTPs becomes economically convenient...|$|R

In each stage, a sample of disposal sludge from sewage treatment plant was analyzed firstly, then a number of sludge samples from bioreactor were considered for 3 weeks. Sludge samples were tested for stabilization and reuse indexes such as: the ratio of volatail solids to total solids (VS/TS), decresing percent of volatail solids, specific oxygen uptake ratio (SOUR), total and fecal coliform(TC and FC) number. The results showed that the average amounts of VS/TS ratio, SOUR and FC density in disposal sludge of sewage treatment plant were 0. 754, 3. 395 and 1. 93  108 respectively. The amounts of sludge stabilization indexes in bioreactor were 60 % for VS/TS ratio after 15 days, 2 mgo 2 /gr. vs. h for SOUR after 17 days and 40 % decrease of VS after 11 dayes.

During the period that high nitrogen removal rates were observed, the STP was operated as a secondary plant with raw sewage, after comminution and aerated grit removal, going directly to the "Rapid Bloc" activated sludge unit.

Phenotypically, the isolate was a Gram-negative rod with a polar flagellum, catalase- and oxidase-positive, containing cytoplasmic inclusions of poly-b-hydroxybutyrate and had an optimal growth temperature of about 47 6 C. Strain N 2 - 680 T was unable to reduce nitrate and could use organic acids, amino acids and carbohydrates as single carbon sources. Chemotaxonomic analysis revealed that ubiquinone 8 was the major respiratory quinone of this organism and that phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol were the major polar lipids. At 50 6 C, the major components in fatty acid methyl ester analysis were C 16 : 0 and cyclo-C 17 : 0. The highest 16 S rDNA sequence identity of isolate N 2 - 680 T was to Leptothrix mobilis and Ideonella dechloratans (95 ? 7 %) and to Rubrivivax gelatinosus and Aquabacterium commune (95 ? 6 %). 16 S rDNA sequence similarities to species of two related thermophilic genera, Caldimonas manganoxidans and Tepidimonas ignava, were lower (93 ? 6 and 94 ? 7 %). On the basis of phylogenetic analyses and physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, it is proposed that isolate N 2 - 680 T represents a new genus and species, for which the name Caenibacterium thermophilum gen. nov., sp. nov. is propose...|$|E
40|$|Activated sludge was {{successfully}} incorporated as the biocatalyst in the fast, ferricyanide-mediated {{biochemical oxygen demand}} (FM-BOD) bioassay. Sludge preparation procedures were optimized for three potential biocatalysts; aeration basin mixed liquor, <b>aerobic</b> <b>digester</b> sludge and return activated sludge. Following a 24 h starving period, the return activated sludge and mixed liquor sludges reported the highest oxidative degradation of a standard glucose/glutamic acid (GGA) mixture and the return activated sludge also recorded the lowest endogenous FM-respiration rate. Dynamic working ranges up to 170 mg BOD 5 L- 1 for OECD standard solutions and 300 mg BOD 5 L- 1 for GGA were obtained. This is a considerable improvement upon the BOD 5 standard assay and most other rapid BOD techniques. Time-series ferricyanide-mediated oxidation of the OECD 170 standard approached that of the GGA 198 standard after 3 - 6 h. This is noteworthy given the OECD standard is formulated as a synthetic sewage analogue. A highly significant correlation with the BOD 5 standard method (n = 35, p < 0. 001, R = 0. 952) was observed for a wide diversity of real wastewater samples. The mean degradation efficiency was indistinguishable from that observed for the BOD 5 assay. These results demonstrate that the activated sludge FM-BOD assay {{may be used for}} simple, same-day BOD analysis of wastewaters. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EnvironmentNo Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|The {{programs}} and activities described herein were {{supported in part}} by fundsprovided by the United States Department of the Interior as authorized underthe Water Resources Act of 1964, Public Law 88 - 379. iii It had been observed over a one-year period, January 1972 to January 1973, that the MiUlani Se 1 JJage Treatment Plant (STP), located in central Oahu, Hawaii, discharged in its effluent only approximately 30 % of the total nitrogen it received in its predominantly domestic raw sewage influent. JJu:r>ing the period that high nitrogen removal rates were observed, the STP was operated as a secondary plant with raw sewage, after corruninution and aerated grit removal, going directly to the "Rapid Bloc " activated sludge unit.

JJu:r>ing the fall of 1973, a primary sedimentation tank and an anaerobic digester, which was to replace the <b>aerobic</b> <b>digester,</b> were added to the components of the STP. The plant was designed for an average waste water flow of 0. 93 mgd capacity before modification and 1. 81 mgd after modification.

40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} the new Elhaj Yousif Sewage Treatment Plant, which serves Khartoum North Industrial areas and is proposed to serve the Residential area of Khartoum Bahri. From site visits, personal interview, and relevant documents and drawings, Elhaj Yousif Treatment Plant is anticipated to be overloaded {{and as a result}} the effluent quality will be deteriorated. The Treatment Plant was designed based on BOD equal to 300 mg/l, TSS equal to 300 mg/l, and average flow rate of 40000 m 3 /d, although the actual BOD influent equal to 1500 mg/l and TSS influent equal to 716. 4 mg/l. The plant’s final effluent of BOD and TSS should equal to 20 mg/l and 30 mg/l respectively as assigned by the Environment Health law, Sudan, 1975. Hence, the treatment plant needs to undergo significant modifications and improvements. In order to reduce the high BOD, the raw sewage must be composed of at least two thirds domestic wastes blended with one third industrial waste. That means the flow rate from industrial area should equal to 13000 m 3 /d and from residential area should equal to 27000 m 3 /d. Blending domestic waste with industrial waste will also guarantee the sufficiency of nutrients for bacteria to act expeditiously. For further reduction in BOD and TSS it is recommended to put the old headwork or old preliminary treatment system into action. Since the concrete state and dimensions of the preliminary treatment system is in good condition and can serve future needs, however some mechanical and electrical components need some maintenance. With regard to primary treatment it is better to add two more sedimentation tanks with the same dimension of the existing ones. The removed BOD and TSS through the headwork and the sedimentation tanks will be approximately equal to 800 mg/l and 337. 6 mg/l respectively. To avoid the organic shock loading and flow rates variation in the new treatment plant, Equalization Basin unit must be introduced. As a consequence of the overloaded Treatment Plant, the aeration basin of the biological Activated Sludge unit should be modified. Fortunately the aeration basin volume accommodates BOD removal but it needs to be supplied by 10 additional blowers. The aeration basin process will act as extended aeration process. vii The wastewater effluent is planned to be reused for irrigation, therefore disinfection is required as stated by WHO and FAO. However for effective disinfection wastewater must be filtered whether through biological filters or physical filters. In addition to wastewater treatment, sludge must also be treated. The sludge that is produced by the sedimentation tanks is solved by the addition of drying beds for dewatering. Before dewatering, Bacteria must be destructed. This comes through utilizing existing <b>aerobic</b> <b>digester</b> tanks. Due to energy shortage it is recommended to convert the existing <b>Aerobic</b> <b>Digester</b> Tanks to Anaerobic Digester Tanks that produce Methane gas which can be used as energy source...|$|E
40|$|The {{wastewater}} treatment process has developed {{with the primary}} goals of protecting receiving water ecosystems and human health. Over time, there have been continuous innovations in process efficiencies, energy recovery, and nutrient removal. Wastewater offers opportunity for recovery of resources of various economic values, and recent research aims at process innovation to optimize resource recovery while still achieving the primary goals of the treatment process. The objective {{of this study is}} to assess the logistical and economic feasibility of recovery of nitrogen and phosphorus at two municipal treatment plants in the Tampa Bay area, one employing aerobic digestion and the other anaerobic digestion. The study is conducted using literature review of applicable processes, mass balance on the fate of nutrients (N and P) through the treatment plants and special attention to sludge handling. Based on the whole-plant mass balance conducted at the facilities, it is estimated that over 80 % of the nutrient influent is routed to the solids handling side of the plant, warranting special attention to this area for nutrient recovery. Sludge digested through anaerobic and anaerobic processes have distinctly different characteristics and opportunities for resource recovery are specific to each process. Mass balances for nitrogen in the anaerobic digestion process show a high concentration of dissolved ammonia. The feasibility of struvite precipitation by addition of phosphate and magnesium compounds is evaluated through batch reaction using anaerobic sludge filtrate. Aerobic sludge contains most of the nutrient resources in the solid phase, ready for recovery if handled properly. Phosphorus release is a potential concern and specific phosphorus release rates are evaluated for a municipal scale <b>aerobic</b> <b>digester...</b>|$|E
40|$|The oxic-settling anoxic (OSA) process {{interchanges}} {{activated sludge}} between alternating redox conditions (e. g., aerobic and anoxic) to reduce biosolids production. Iron salts addition to wastewater is performed to remove phosphorous, but this study demonstrated {{that it may}} impair OSA performance. Batch test {{results showed that the}} addition of iron salt (as Fe 2 +) decreased the volatile solids reduction of an intermittently aerated batch reactor (i. e., aerobic/anoxic), probably because iron reduced the destruction of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that serve as the structural framework of sludge flocs. The effect of different FeCl 2 dosages (0, 15, and 30 mg l− 1) on the sludge yield and EPS profile of an OSA system consisting of a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) attached to external aerobic/anoxic and anoxic reactors was compared to those of a control system consisting of an SBR attached to a single-pass <b>aerobic</b> <b>digester.</b> The two SBRs were fed with real wastewater and operated continuously in parallel for 230 d. Without FeCl 2 addition, the sludge yield (g MLVSS g− 1 COD) of the SBR in the OSA system was 24. 8 % less than that of the control SBR. Moreover, the waste sludge of the OSA system had lower volatile solids content than that of the control system. When 15 or 30 mg l− 1 FeCl 2 was added to the influent, OSA was unable to decrease the sludge yield of the SBR and the volatile solids content of the waste sludge. FeCl 2 dosing increased the EPS concentration of sludge in the external aerobic/anoxic reactor, confirming that floc destruction in that reactor was reduced by the presence of iron...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} the examination of effectiveness of lime dose in order to stabilization of sewage sludge and comparison of lime stabilized sludge reuse with aerobic digested sludge reuse. Lime and aerobic stabilization were carried out in two laboratory reactor with 40 L capacity. The sludge samples were taken from the return activated sludge line in four times. Lime was used at various ratios and the mixture was stabilized for 30 days. During the lime hydrated stabilization pH values were significantly increased from 7 to 12. 5. Also, <b>aerobic</b> <b>digester</b> was loaded with raw sludge and mixed by sufficient amount of air for 30 days. The results indicate that the lime addition with the dose of 0. 4 g Ca(OH) 2 g - 1 DS could completely inactive a high amount of fecal coliforms within 1 h and in all of the times was lower than 1000 MPN g - 1 DS after 30 days (p< 0. 01). But after 30 days, fecal coliforms density in aerobic digested sludge could not achieve to Class A of USEPA category. In two stabilization methods, density of viable helminths ova could not reduce to 1 ova/ 4 g DS and could not achieve to Class A of USEPA category. Therefore, these methods could be achieved the reduction requirement set by USEPA for class B (p< 0. 01) and the products could be well used as a landfill cover or a soil conditioner. Finally, our study confirmed that lime sludge stabilization has a higher hygienic effect and more cost-effective than aerobic stabilization, specially, when such sludge is used to dung and modify acid soils...|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{potential}} health hazards {{associated with the use}} of sludge for agricultural purposes, Dudley et al (1980) published a scheme for the routine analysis of bacteria in municipal sewage sludge. In this study, the Dudley et al scheme (1980) was modified by updating some of the procedures. Aerobically digested sludge generated by the Bowling Green Wastewater Treatment Plant, Bowling Green, Kentucky, was analyzed using the modified scheme. Sludge samples were collected once every two months over a one-year period from October 1989 to August 1990. Egg yolk-free tryptose sulfite cycloserine agar in conjunction with the revewrse CAMP test was used to assay for Clostridium perfringens. This procedure improved the one proposed by Dudley et al. (1980) by achieving a higher confirmation rate, reducing testing time, allowing for easier interpretation of results, and increasing accuracy. Selective and differential media by Rippey and Cabelli (1979) were added to the scheme to isolate Aeromonas, Aeroomonas hydrophila and Aeromonas caviae were successfully isolated wand were identified using the system by Cunliffe and Adcock (1989) for speciating aeromonads. Baird-Parker medium was compared to mannitol salt agar for effectiveness in isolating Staphylococcus from sludge. Statistical analysis showed Baird-Parker medium to be significantly more effective than mannitol salt agar. However, neither agar reduced background flora to acceptable levels. Staphylococcus isolates were subject to species identification by the API Staph Ident system (Analytab Products, Plainview, New York). Staphylococcus xylosus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were found to be present in the sludge. A procedure by Ottolenghi and Hamparian (1987) was employed to isolate Salmonella in sludge. No salmonellae were isolated over the one year period. Over the year-long study, bacterial numbers, with the exception of Clostridium perfringens and the total aerobic count, fluctuated with variations in the <b>aerobic</b> <b>digester</b> temperature.
