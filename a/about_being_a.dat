5|$|To {{make the}} new game feel refreshing, only certain {{multiplayer}} elements were retained as the small team took {{the game in}} a different direction. They evaluated {{the core of the}} Rainbow Six series, which they thought was <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> member of a counter-terrorist team traveling around the globe to deal with dangerous terrorist attacks – operations which are usually intense confrontations between attackers and defenders. However, the team wanted to fit these ideas into a multiplayer format which would increase the game's sustainability. These became the basic concept ideas for the game. As the development team hoped that the game can be replayed frequently, the team decided to devote all the resources into developing the game's multiplayer and abandoned the single-player campaign.|$|E

25|$|The proper policy, in my view, {{should be}} to affirm the status of physician-assisted suicide and {{euthanasia}} as illegal. In so doing we would affirm that as a society we condemn ending a patient's life and do not consider that to have one's life ended by a doctor is a right. This does not mean we deny that in exceptional cases interventions are appropriate, as acts of desperation when all other elements of treatment—all medications, surgical procedures, psychotherapy, spiritual care, and so on—have been tried. Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> burden, or worried about being dependent. All these may be signs that not every effort has yet been made.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{perception}} <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> aged person in South-Western Nigeria. 594 aged persons were interviewed through questionnaire administration in Lagos and Oyo states of South-western Nigeria. The univariate, bivariate and One-way Analysis of variance (F-ratios) {{were employed in}} the analyses of this research. The major {{findings of this study}} are: firstly, the univariate and bivariate results indicate that there is low-perception <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> aged person. Secondly, One-way Analysis of variance (F-ratios) show that the study location, age category, means of livelihood; and usual place of residence (Oyo and Lagos state rural settings) have significant influences on perception <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> aged person in South-Western Nigeria. Thus, the paper recommends the following: firstly, that aged persons from Lagos state who are 50 - 79 years should begin to admit from now that they are ‘elderly people’ despite {{the fact that some of}} them are retired and still physically active. Secondly, the salary earners who are still working as well as Lagos-rural dwellers should urgently assume their roles as elders both in the families and in larger Nigerian society.
