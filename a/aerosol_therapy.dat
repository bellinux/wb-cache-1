40|$|Advances in {{medicine}} and healthcare have resulted in significant improvements for those children and adolescents living with a chronic health condition. However, the treatments prescribed will only work if they are taken. Rates of adherence to treatment in cystic fibrosis are low. This {{is especially true for}} adherence to <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy,</b> a particular concern considering the reliance on <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> for the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The advent of Adaptive Aerosol Delivery™ (AAD) technology has enabled accurate and objective measurement of adherence to <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> treatment. However, the factors which influence the process of adhering to <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> remain largely elusive. Therefore, the current study aims to qualitatively explore the process of adhering to <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> in a clinical sample of adolescents with CF from both a patient and parent perspective. In addition, objective data downloaded from an AAD device (the I-neb™, Respironics, Chichester, UK) will be used to cue reflections on actual events around adherence. 12 participants were interviewed (six parent-child dyads). The participating adolescents were all aged between 11 and 16 years and had a CF diagnosis. There were five mothers and one father who took part. The parent and adolescent data were analysed separately using the Grounded Theory Method. Nine core categories for the parent data and nine core categories for the adolescent data were developed into a coherent framework and represented as a theoretical formulation which described the process of adhering to <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> from both a parent and adolescent patient perspective. The theoretical formulation highlights the complexity involved and details the numerous interacting biological, psychological, social and environmental influences on adherence to <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy.</b> These findings are discussed in relation to the existing literature and clinical implications are considered.

40|$|The {{clinical}} use of various aerosol production apparatus for chronic sinusitis was examined. The results are summarized as follows. 1) In <b>aerosol</b> inhalation <b>therapy</b> for chrohic sinusitis {{the most essential}} {{point is that the}} natural ostia are sufficiently open. 2) Nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses are part of a single organ. Therefore the jet nebulizer and the ultrasonic nebulizer for nasal cavity were also useful for paranasal sinuses when the middle meatus lesions were reversible. 3) The most important factor in promoting aerosol deposition in paranasal sinuses was the application of pressure. Without pressure, none of the nebulizers was able to administer sufficient amounts of therapeutic agents. 4) The ultrasonic nebulizer with pressure added was able to administer the largest amount of agent to the paranasal sinuses. As chronic sinusitis is becoming less severe, <b>aerosol</b> inhalation <b>therapy</b> is becoming more widely used.

40|$|Inhalation of aerosolized drugs {{has become}} an {{established}} means for treatment of pulmonary diseases in the last fifiy years. The majoriry of <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> in childhood concerns inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators {{in the management of}} asthma. Administration of drugs via the inhaled route has major advantages over the oral route. The drug is targeted directly to its site of action, which results in a more rapid effect and a lower dose needed with less systemic side effects. However, to deliver the drug into the lungs reliably and reproducibly is difficult, especially in children. It requires understanding of the mechanisms of aerosol deposition in the lungs and knowledge about the factors affecting delivery and deposition of aerosols. There are several ways to deliver therapeutic aerosols to the lungs. The current methods can be classified in three categoties: nebulizers, pressurized metered dose inhales (pMDI's) with or without spacer, and dry powder inhalers (DPT's). Not all systems are suirable for use in young children. Application of <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> in young children requires a different approach compared vvith adults and older children. Factors such as age, co-operation, breathing pattern, nose breathing and size of the airways should be raken into account as they can have substantial effect on the dose delivered to the lungs. Nebulizers have long been the mainstay of <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> in children. Currently, the pMDI combined with spacer is recommended as the first choice for asthma therapy in young children. However, the pMDIIspacer and most other aerosol delivery systems were primarily designed for use in adults, and subsequently adapted for use in children. Furthermore, studying efficiency of aerosol delivery systems in young children is difficult and has ethical limitations. This explains why there is extended information available on the performance of aerosol delivery systems in adults, but only limited data in children. The use of drugs with potential side effects, such as corticosteroids, requires precise dosing with the administration of the lowest effective dose. Therefore, knowledge about the dose inhaled and factors affecting this dose for each particular drug, device and patient is necessary for optimal application of <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy.</b> Better understanding of <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> in children is urgently needed...|$|E

Material and method: the study was developed during a period of six months, in TheNational Center of Cystic Fibrosis, Clinic II of Pediatrics in the Emergency County Hospital, Timisoara. The study group consistedof 12 children with MV. This group was divided into two groups of 6 patients (group 1 and group 2). Group 1 followedinhalation treatment with acetylcysteine, and group 2 with Pulmozyme. Results: The evaluation of the results was done after 2 months and 6 months since the study started, by measuring the FEV, and FVC. For the first group, that used acetylcysteine inthe inhalation therapy, we observed, after 6 months, an increase of FEV with an average of 2. 08 % and of FVC with 2. 13 %. Thegrowth of ventilometric indices were relatively accelerated in the first two months and later there was a slower growth,achieving final value. For the second group, that used Pulmozyme, the growth of ventilometric indices was significantly higher. Discussion: considering the two relatively homogeneous groups, in what concerns the values of ventilometric indices andsuperimposed infection, we believe that inhaled Pulmozyme therapy proved to be superior to acetylcysteine.

40|$|AbstractAerosol {{administration}} of peptide-based drugs {{plays an important}} role in the treatment of pulmonary and systemic diseases and the unique cellular properties of airway epithelium offers a great potential to deliver new compounds. As the relative contributions from the large airways to the alveolar space are important to the local and systemic availability, the sites and mechanism of uptake and transport of different target compounds have to be characterized. Among the different respiratory cells, the ciliated epithelial cells of the larger and smaller airways and the type I and type II pneumocytes are the key players in pulmonary drug transport. With their diverse cellular characteristics, each of these cell types displays a unique uptake possibility. Next to the knowledge of these cellular aspects, the nature of aerosolized drugs, characteristics of delivery systems and the depositional and pulmonary clearance mechanisms display major targets to optimize pulmonary drug delivery. Based on the growing knowledge on pulmonary cell biology and pathophysiology due to modern methods of molecular biology, the future characterization of pulmonary drug transport pathways can lead to new strategies in <b>aerosol</b> drug <b>therapy...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Aerosol</b> <b>therapies</b> {{are often}} used to treat lung {{diseases}} in which ventilation is distributed heterogeneously throughout the lung. As therapeutic aerosols are transported by the inhaled air, {{it is likely that}} deposition is diminished within poorly ventilated regions of the lung. These regions are often the most in need of therapy. We measured the effects of heterogeneous ventilation on aerosol deposition in a group of bronchoconstricted asthmatic subjects. We then developed a new image processing technique which allowed us to identify the anatomical location of aerosol deposition. This technique accounted for blurring due to limited resolution of the PET image, motion artifacts due to breathing, and registration uncertainty. We introduced a theoretical framework to characterize four mechanisms of variability in deposition between peripheral regions of the lung. This framework added insight into the interaction between ventilation and deposition, and will permit the future comparison of the experimental data with computational models. Together, the imaging data and theoretical framework suggested that {{more than a third of}} the observed variability in the deposition per unit volume among lung lobes was due to heterogeneous ventilation. Using helium-oxygen as a carrier gas for aerosol has been considered as a potential intervention to homogenize deposition in the lung periphery. To investigate this, we repeated the PET-CT measurements in a second group of bronchoconstricted asthmatic subjects breathing helium-oxygen, and compared the results to those of the group breathing room air. We did not find systematic differences in the deposition patterns of the two groups, although the relationship between ventilation and aerosol deposition tended to be stronger in the group that used helium-oxygen as the carrier gas. Finally, we used analytical tools and an in-silico model of bronchoconstriction to illustrate the emergence of pendelluft gas transport between parallel regions of the lung. We found that though pendelluft may emerge in asthma, the overall volume passed between parallel regions of the lung is likely less than 2 % of the tidal volume, and thus is not likely to substantially influence aerosol deposition. by Elliot Greenblatt.

40|$|<b>Aerosol</b> gene <b>therapy</b> offers great {{potential}} for treating acquired and inherited lung diseases. For treatment of chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, asthma and emphysema, non-viral gene therapy will likely require repeated administration to maintain transgene expression in slowly dividing, or terminally differentiated, lung epithelial cells. When complexed with plasmid DNA (pDNA), the synthetic polymer, 25  kDa branched Polyethylenimine (PEI), can be formulated for aerosol delivery to the lungs. We show that pDNA/PEI aerosol formulations can be repeatedly administered to airways of mice on at least 10 occasions with no detectable toxicity. Interestingly, peak reporter gene activity upon repeated delivery was significantly reduced by up to 75 % compared with a single administration, despite similar pDNA lung deposition at each subsequent aerosol exposure. Although the precise mechanism of inhibition is unknown, it is independent of mouse strain, does not involve an immune response, and is mediated by PEI. Importantly, using a dosing interval of 56 days, delivery of a fourth-generation, CpG-free plasmid generated high-level, sustained transgene expression, which was further boosted at subsequent administrations. Together these data indicate that pDNA/PEI aerosol formulations offer a versatile platform for gene delivery to the lung resulting in sustained transgene expression suitable for treatment of chronic lung diseases...|$|R

40|$|Non-viral <b>aerosol</b> gene <b>therapy</b> offers great {{potential}} for treating chronic lung diseases of the airways such as cystic fibrosis (CF). Early clinical trials showed that transgene expression in the airways was transient whereas maximal duration of transgene expression is essential in order to minimise the frequency of aerosol treatments. Improved vector design, such as careful selection of the promoter/enhancer, can lead to more persistent levels of transgene expression, but multiple factors affect expression in vivo. Following aerosol delivery to the lungs of mice, we measured reporter gene expression from a CpG-free luciferase transgene cassette {{in the context of}} both a plasmid and minicircle vector configuration and showed that the vector backbone had no effect on expression. Transgene activity was affected by the vector backbone however, when a similar, but sub-optimal CpG-containing transgene was used, suggesting that aspects of the plasmid backbone had a negative impact on transgene expression. Similar studies were performed in Toll-like receptor- 9 (TLR 9) knockout mice to investigate a potential role for the TLR 9 signalling pathway in detecting CpGs in the vector sequence. Even in the absence of TLR 9, persistent expression could only be achieved with a CpG-free transgene.

40|$|Background: Considering the {{prevalence}} and associated {{burden of disease}} due to bronchial asthma, it is mandatory to obtain an optimal control {{of the disease and}} to improve outcomes for these patients. But it has been observed that there is very poor adherence to the inhalational therapy which leads to the suboptimal control of the disease. Objectives of the Study: To study the adherence for <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> in bronchial asthma patients and {{to assess the impact of}} health education and self-action plan in improving the compliance to the therapy. Methodology: A prospective study was done in a total of 500 bronchial asthma patients over a period of 2 years. Once included in the study, the patients were followed-up for a total of 12 weeks for calculation of nonadherence to the <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy.</b> In nonadherent patients, we employed various health education strategies to improve the compliance in these cases. Results: A total of 500 patients of bronchial asthma who were started on <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> over duration of 2 years were included in the study. At the end of 12 weeks, it was observed that, only 193 patients (38. 6 %) had regular compliance and 307 patients (61. 4 %) were noncompliant to <b>aerosol</b> <b>therapy</b> as prescribed for bronchial asthma. Factors that were associated with poor compliance were: Lower educational level status, poor socioeconomic status, cumbersome regimens, dislike of medication, and distant pharmacies. Nondrug factors that reduced the compliance were: Fears about side effects, anger about condition or its treatment, forgetfulness or complacency, and patient′s ill attitudes toward health. After employing the various strategies for improving the compliance in these patients, the compliance increased in 176 patients (57. 3 %) among the earlier defaulted patients, while the remaining 131 patients (42. 7 %) were found to be noncompliant even after various educational techniques. Conclusion: Noncompliance in asthma management is a fact of life and no single compliance improving strategy probably will be as effective as a good physician-patient relationship. Optimal self-management allowing for optimization of asthma control by adjustment of medications may be conducted by either self-adjustment with the aid of a written action plan or by regular medical review.

Antipseudomonal antibiotics have extended the survival of CF patients to 40 years. Tobramycin is a bactericidal aminoglycoside antibiotic with demonstrated activity against gram-negative microorganisms. Initially, the drug was administered as an inhaled parenteral solution. Subsequently, a specific tobramycin inhalation solution was developed. PulmoSphere™ technology enables dry tobramycin powder to be formulated for inhalation (tobramycin inhalation powder) using a small and portable capsule-based breath-activated device (T- 326). Chronic colonization by P. aeruginosa is the main indication for <b>aerosol</b> antibiotic <b>therapy.</b> The American Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, European guidelines, and Spanish consensus guidelines provide different recommendations for eradication.

40|$|THE {{pharmacodynamics}} of pulmonary absorption has {{not been}} generally considered in the clinical reports {{on the success of}} <b>aerosol</b> and intratracheal <b>therapy.</b> There is equally meager information regarding the action of various pharmacologically active diluents in promoting or retarding ab-sorption of penicillin from the pulmonary epithelium. In a recent study x we described various factors influencing absorption from the normal human lung. Crystalline penicillin G potassium (100, 000 units) in physiologic saline was administered intramuscularly, intratracheally and by oxygen-aerosolization. The blood levels and urinary excretion, fol-lowing intratracheal injection, were lower but more sustained than those following intramuscular administration. Rapid absorption would normally be expected from such a large and vascular area as the alveolar bed. The lung was thus demonstrated as a reservoir capable of considerably retarding the expected rate of absorption. By comparing the total urinary excretion of the intratracheal with aerosol method of administration, the amount o...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePurpose: <b>Aerosol</b> {{inhalation}} <b>therapy</b> {{is one of}} {{the methods}} to treat rhinosinusitis. However the topical drug delivery to the posterior nose and paranasal sinuses shows only limited efficiency. A precise sinusal targeting remains a main challenge for aerosol treatment of sinus disorders. This paper proposes a comparative study of the nasal deposition patterns of micron and submicron particles using planar gamma-scintigraphy imaging vs. a new 3 -dimensional (3 D) imaging approach based on SPECT-CT measurements. Methods: Radiolabelled nebulizations have been performed on a plastinated model of human nasal cast coupled with a respiratory pump. First, the benefits provided by SPECT-CT imaging were compared with 2 D gamma-scintigraphy and radioactive quantification of maxillary sinus lavage as reference for the sonic 2. 8 μm aerosol sinusal deposition. Then, the impact on nasal deposition of various airborne particle sizes was assessed. Results: The 2 D methodology overestimates aerosol deposition in the maxillary sinuses by a factor 9 whereas the 3 D methodology is in agreement with the maxillary sinus lavage reference methodology. Then with the SPECT-CT approach we highlighted that the higher particle size was mainly deposited in the central nasal cavity contrary to the submicron aerosol particles (33. 8 ± 0. 6 % of total deposition for the 2. 8 μm particles vs. 1 ± 0. 3 % for the 230 nm particles). Conclusion: Benefits of SPECT/CT for the assessment of radiolabelled aerosol deposition in rhinology are clearly demonstrated. This 3 D methodology should be preferentially used for scintigraphic imaging of sinusal deposition in Human...|$|R
