5|$|August {{saw them}} {{participate}} in Division One of the European Championship, against Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and Scotland. The {{games against the}} Netherlands and Scotland had ODI status. In the tournament, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> team's second ODI, Ireland recorded their first ODI win, beating fellow Associates Scotland by 85runs after man-of-the-match Eoin Morgan made 99. Although the match against the Netherlands was a no-result, Ireland won the European Championship title. Ireland's second Intercontinental Cup title came in the 2006–2007 competition. They faced Canada in the final and won by an innings and 115 runs, the four-day match concluding within two days. This made Ireland {{the first team to}} successfully defend the Continental Cup.|$|E

500|$|Henkes and Bindervoet {{generally}} summarise {{the critical}} consensus when they argue that, between the thematically indicative {{opening and closing}} chapters, the book concerns [...] "two big questions" [...] which are never resolved: {{what is the nature}} of protagonist HCE’s secret sin, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> letter, written by his wife ALP, about? HCE's unidentifiable sin has most generally been interpreted as representing man's original sin as a result of the Fall of Man. Anthony Burgess sees HCE, through his dream, trying [...] "to make the whole of history swallow up his guilt for him" [...] and to this end [...] "HCE has, so deep in his sleep, sunk to a level of dreaming in which he has become a collective being rehearsing the collective guilt of man." [...] Fargnoli and Gillespie argue that although undefined, [...] "Earwicker's alleged crime in the Park" [...] appears to have been of a [...] "voyeuristic, sexual, or scatological nature". [...] ALP's letter appears a number of times throughout the book, in a number of different forms, and as its contents cannot be definitively delineated, it is usually believed to be both an exoneration of HCE, and an indictment of his sin. Herring argues that [...] "he effect of ALP's letter is precisely the opposite of her intent [...] the more ALP defends her husband in her letter, the more scandal attaches to him." [...] Patrick A. McCarthy argues that [...] "it is appropriate that the waters of the Liffey, representing Anna Livia, are washing away the evidence of Earwicker's sins as [...] for (they tell us) she takes on her husband's guilt and redeems him; alternately she is tainted with his crimes and regarded as an accomplice".|$|E

2500|$|Another {{big change}} to {{swimming}} occurred when Speedo launched the LZR Racer swim suits on February 13, 2008. The suits, developed by NASA and the Australian Institute of Sport, {{were designed to}} repel water, allow oxygen to flow to the muscles, and hold the body in a more hydrodynamic position. The suits had been proven to give the swimmer a lower time by 1.9 to 2.2%. Due to the advantage provided by the suits, some swimmers complained about the fairness in its use, because some people used multiple swimsuits to improve buoyancy and compressing of body; even the official blog for the National Collegiate Athletic Association pondered whether they were [...] "technology doping" [...] <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> difference between gaining advantage from a swimsuit and gaining advantage from performance-enhancing drugs. In response to these complaints, the International Swimming Federation (FINA) scheduled a meeting with Speedo to discuss the suits. After the meeting, FINA dismissed the claims of cheating, and endorsed the suits for future swimming meets. By August 14, 2008, 62 world records had been broken by swimmers wearing the LZR Racer.|$|E
