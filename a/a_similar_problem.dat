5|$|Hamilton {{was once}} again fastest during third {{practice}} on Saturday morning, even while suffering from overheating under his seat. The two Mercedes cars were separated by two-tenths of a second with the two Ferraris of Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen behind, another half a second down. Red Bull had a slight upturn in fortune, with Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat finishing fifth and sixth respectively. McLaren-Honda had another problematic session as Fernando Alonso stopped the car just after starting his installation lap. Teammate Jenson Button was called into the pit lane as well, citing <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>problem</b> with the engine, but was able to continue later in the session. Felipe Massa experienced smoke in his cockpit both on Friday and Saturday, apparently caused by the new titanium plates underneath the cars which also create sparks when driving over bumps on the track.|$|E
5|$|Los Angeles robbery-homicide {{sergeant}} Vincent Hanna (Plank) is on {{the trail}} of a gang of ruthless professional criminals, led by the methodical Patrick McLaren (McArthur), whose only mistake in the last heist was the killing of armored car guards by the new recruit, Waingro (Berkeley), who is a loose cannon. But Hanna is soon surprised when he discovers that he and McLaren have quite a lot in common. While McLaren and his gang plan another heist, Hanna and his colleagues keep surveillance. Hanna is facing a personal problem, as the police work is straining his relationship with his wife, Lillian (Pouget). Moreover, McLaren is also facing <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>problem</b> when he finds himself falling in love with Eady (Harrington), which he personally condemns due to the commitment required to his profession.|$|E
5|$|The British mandate in Palestine, {{where an}} Arab {{majority}} lived alongside a Jewish minority, presented the British with <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>problem</b> {{to that of}} India.

Frustrated by the intractability of the problem, attacks by Jewish paramilitary organisations and the increasing cost of maintaining its military presence, Britain announced in 1947 that it would withdraw in 1948 and leave the matter to the United Nations to solve. The UN General Assembly subsequently voted for a plan to partition Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state.|$|E

5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and two on Saturday. The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final {{practice sessions}} were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. Barrichello set the first session's fastest time with a lap of 1 minute and 25.057 seconds, three-tenths of a second ahead of Jarno Trulli. Michael Schumacher was one-tenth of a second off Trulli's pace, while Coulthard set the fourth fastest time. The two Arrows drivers were fifth and sixth fastest; Pedro de la Rosa ahead of Jos Verstappen. Frentzen, Fisichella, Villeneuve and Alexander Wurz rounded out the top ten fastest drivers of the session. In the second practice session, Barrichello was again fastest despite not improving his time from the first session; Michael Schumacher finished with the second fastest time. Trulli set the third fastest time, with the two McLaren drivers fourth and fifth, Häkkinen ahead of Coulthard. Eddie Irvine recorded the sixth quickest lap. de la Rosa, Diniz, Verstappen and Mika Salo completed the top ten drivers. Alesi's Prost was afflicted by a hydraulic leak; this restricted him to three timed laps, and he was slowest overall. Wurz suffered <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>problem</b> and set the 18th fastest time. Mazzacane spun off and did not take any further part in the session.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Dominik von Kripp {{suggested}} that the crest may {{have served as a}} rudder, an idea embraced by several later researchers. One researcher, Ross S. Stein, even {{suggested that}} the crest may have supported a membrane of skin connecting the backward-pointing crest to the neck and back, increasing its surface area and effectiveness as a rudder. The rudder hypothesis again, {{does not take into account}} females nor P. sternbergi, which had an upward-pointing, not backward-pointing crest. Bennett also found that even in its capacity as a rudder, the crest would not provide nearly so much directional force as simply maneuvering the wings. The suggestion that the crest was an air brake, and that the animals would turn their heads to the side in order to slow down, suffers from <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>problem.</b> Additionally, the rudder and air brake hypotheses do not explain why such large variation exists in crest size even among adults.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Eragon {{continues}} his training, but is discouraged when the {{scar on his}} back causes him to have agonizing seizures multiple times per day. He has been swooning over Arya {{for most of the}} book. Saphira also has <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>problem</b> with Glaedr, as she believes him to be a good choice for a mate and tries to win his affections. Eragon tells her it would not be proper, and she in turn replies that Arya is not as important as his education. Both efforts fail miserably, but bring Eragon and Saphira closer together. Later, at the ancient elven ceremony, the Agaetí Blödhren (Blood-Oath Celebration), Eragon is altered by a spectral dragon. The changes alter his senses, and enhance his abilities, effectively turning him into an elf-human hybrid, as well as healing all of his wounds, scars, and back injury. Reinvigorated, Eragon continues training until he learns that the Empire will soon attack the Varden in Surda. Afterward he confesses his feelings for Arya who rejects him harshly. Dismayed, he leaves without completing his training, to aid the Varden in battle. Upon leaving he is given a bow with magical arrows, a belt with twelve priceless diamonds, an enchanted flask of elvish concoction, a copy of a poem he wrote and presented for the Agaetí Blödhren, and the blessing of Oromis and Glaedr.|$|E

5|$|Alesi, {{the first}} front-runner {{to make a}} {{scheduled}} pit stop on lap 18, rejoined in tenth. During the next two laps Salo passed Irvine for twelfth, whilst Barrichello made a pit stop from sixth position and came out in eleventh. By lap 22, Michael Schumacher had increased his lead over Häkkinen to eleven seconds. Ralf Schumacher, ten seconds behind Häkkinen, maintained a six-second gap over teammate Button. Michael Schumacher made a pit stop on that lap, emerging in third position. On lap 23 Barrichello passed Herbert for ninth position, and {{during the next two}} laps Villeneuve and Ralf Schumacher made pit stops. Button made a pit stop from fourth position on lap 26, and Häkkinen one lap later; Häkkinen was told by his team (on pit boards) to speed up to reduce the gap to Michael Schumacher, who had a heavier fuel load. Button dropped to eighth position, and Häkkinen came out behind Michael Schumacher. Frentzen and Coulthard made their pit stops together on lap 28, with Coulthard emerging ahead of Frentzen. On that lap, Barrichello passed Alesi for sixth position. Barrichello, setting the fastest lap of the race (1:53.803 on lap 30), had consecutive fastest laps before making his second pit stop on lap 31. However, his car's fuel pressure dropped and he was pushed by marshals into the pit lane. Barrichello and Alesi (who had <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>problem)</b> retired, and Button inherited fourth place. Salo was the final scheduled driver to make a pit stop, on lap 33.|$|E
5|$|Parallel-coupled {{lines is}} another popular {{topology}} for printed boards, for which open-circuit lines are the simplest to implement since the manufacturing consists of {{nothing more than}} the printed track. The design consists of a row of parallel λ/2 resonators, but coupling over only λ/4 to each of the neighbouring resonators, so forming a staggered line as shown in figure 9. Wider fractional bandwidths are possible with this filter than with the capacitive gap filter, but <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>problem</b> arises on printed boards as dielectric loss reduces the Q. Lower-Q lines require tighter coupling and smaller gaps between them which is limited by the accuracy of the printing process. One solution to this problem is to print the track on multiple layers with adjacent lines overlapping but not in contact because they are on different layers. In this way, the lines can be coupled across their width, which results in much stronger coupling than when they are edge-to-edge, and a larger gap becomes possible for the same performance. For other (non-printed) technologies, short-circuit lines may be preferred since the short-circuit provides a mechanical attachment point for the line and Q-reducing dielectric insulators are not required for mechanical support. Other than for mechanical and assembly reasons, there is little preference for open-circuit over short-circuit coupled lines. Both structures can realize the same range of filter implementations with the same electrical performance. Both types of parallel-coupled filters, in theory, do not have spurious passbands at twice the centre frequency as seen in many other filter topologies (e.g., stubs). However, suppression of this spurious passband requires perfect tuning of the coupled lines which is not realized in practice, so there is inevitably some residual spurious passband at this frequency.|$|E
