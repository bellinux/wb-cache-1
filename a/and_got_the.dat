5|$|Irwin R. Schyster {{remained}} in {{control for the}} majority of his match against the 1-2-3 Kid. Although the Kid hit several kicks, Schyster regained control every time. Schyster used his usual abdominal stretch while using the ring ropes for leverage before the Kid made a brief comeback by hitting a moonsault. Schyster hit a Write Off, however, <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> pin.|$|E

5|$|The third match saw Big Show face Snitsky. The match {{began with}} Big Show and Snitsky brawling as the bell rang. Big Show {{was able to}} perform a big slap to the chest and headbutt. Snitsky then took the upper hand over Big Show, as he applied an armbar hold, after {{countering}} a chokeslam. Big Show delivered a Spinebuster <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> victory after a successful chokeslam.|$|E

5000|$|Team Challenge 7: The contestants {{split into}} four teams of two (Christian and Courtney, Cutter and Willie, Daniel and Jaimee, and Elizabeth and Leslie). The {{objective}} was to take a cut of chicken and create a dish with it, though the teams would not find out what cut they would get until after they had picked their ingredients.

5|$|Before the {{pay-per-view}} began, Shane Douglas defeated Buddy Rose {{in a dark}} match. Hercules attacked Shawn Michaels {{prior to}} the first televised bout, hitting him in the knee with a chain. Although his partner was unable to compete, Jannetty controlled {{the beginning of the}} match, using hip tosses to throw Roma and Hercules. Power and Glory then attacked Jannetty while their manager, Slick, distracted the referee. Although Jannetty was able to mount a brief comeback, Roma and Hercules wore him down <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> victory after performing a PowerPlex—a superplex from Hercules followed by a diving splash from Roma.|$|E
5|$|Bradbury {{took charge}} at Los Alamos at a {{difficult}} time. Staff were leaving in droves, living conditions were poor {{and there was}} a possibility that the laboratory would close. He managed to persuade enough staff to stay, <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> University of California to renew the contract to manage the laboratory. He pushed continued development of nuclear weapons, transforming them from laboratory devices to production models. Numerous improvements made them safer, more reliable and easier to store and handle, and made more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel.|$|E
5|$|Harper {{noticed that}} Bartram's notes were {{considerably}} altered and expanded in the printed edition, and the {{detail of the}} white tail appeared in print {{for the first time}} in this revised account. Harper believed that Bartram could have tried to fill in details of the bird from memory <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> tail coloration wrong. Harper and several other researchers have attempted to prove the former existence of a king vulture relative in Florida at this late date, suggesting that the population was in the process of extinction and finally disappeared during a cold spell. Additionally, William McAtee, noting the tendency of birds to form Floridian subspecies, suggested that the white tail could be a sign that the painted vulture was a subspecies of the king vulture.|$|E

5|$|Robertson {{made his}} MLB debut on September 2, 2002 against the Texas Rangers. He was {{starting}} {{in place of}} Roy Oswalt, who was serving a suspension for hitting a batter with a pitch. He allowed two runs in 2⅔ innings <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> loss in his only start that year. He got his second decision in a 5–2 loss to the San Francisco Giants on September 28. In the game, the Giants clinched a playoff spot, and Barry Bonds {{hit a home run}} off Robertson into McCovey Cove to seal the game for them. He finished the season with a 6.52 ERA in 9⅔ innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|Since NIU got {{the ball}} to start the game, Kent State got it to start the second half <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> ball at their own 47 after a 28-yard return by Josh Boyle. Kent State {{got the ball}} into the red zone, but {{ultimately}} settled for a field goal which cut NIU's lead to 4 points. Northern Illinois' prolific offense continued their scoring by executing a 10-play, 75-yard drive highlighted by a 44-yard run by Lynch on a 4th and 1. Lynch would run it into the end zone for a 1-yard touchdown three plays later. After the Golden Flashes went three-and-out, the Huskies scored, this time via a 29-yard field goal by Sims.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} another {{standard}} match involving Shelton Benjamin and Kerwin White. White {{tried to get}} in the ring, but Benjamin slid out and tripped him. Benjamin threw White into the ring barricade, which led him to throw him back in the ring as the bell rang to officially start the match. In the ring, Benjamin body slammed White, which was followed by a running forearm. White retaliated with a dropkick to Benjamin's knee. The match concluded after White grabbed a golf club that he hid in the steel steps and tried to assault Benjamin with it. Benjamin, however, countered with a T-Bone Suplex and covered White <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> pinfall victory.|$|E

5|$|In the playoffs, the Pittsburgh Steelers {{visited the}} RCA Dome {{for the second}} AFC divisional playoff game of the 2005 season. In the fourth quarter {{with only a few}} minutes left in the game, Manning threw what looked to be the game-ending {{interception}} to safety Troy Polamalu, but the interception was overturned (a call the NFL later admitted was incorrect). The Colts went on to score, <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> ball back down three points {{near the end of the}} game. On fourth down, Manning was sacked near his own goal line, and the game seemed to be over as the Steelers were one yard from a touchdown. On the next play, the ball was fumbled by running back Jerome Bettis and picked up by Colts defender Nick Harper who appeared to have a clear path down the sideline for what might have been the game-winning score. However, Steelers' quarterback Ben Roethlisberger dove in front of Harper and tackled him by the leg, saving a touchdown. Then the Colts drove down the field to the Steelers 27-yard line, before Mike Vanderjagt missed a field goal as time ran out.|$|E
5|$|Nick Swisher {{walked to}} lead off {{the fifth inning}} and {{advanced}} to second on a Melky Cabrera single. Swisher restored the Yankees' lead, scoring on a single by Jeter, and Cabrera added to it by scoring a run on a Damon single. Brett Gardner replaced Cabrera in center field as a defensive substitution {{in the bottom of}} the sixth inning after Cabrera left the game due to a hamstring injury. Chan Ho Park relieved Phillies starter Joe Blanton in the seventh and held the Yankees scoreless in that inning. Chase Utley hit his third solo home run of the series {{in the bottom of the}} seventh with two outs, bringing the game to 4–3. Dámaso Marte relieved Sabathia <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> final out of the seventh without further scoring.|$|E
5|$|On 8 November 1923 Hitler and the SA stormed {{a public}} meeting of 3,000 people {{organised}} by Kahr in the Bürgerbräukeller, a beer hall in Munich. Interrupting Kahr's speech, {{he announced that}} the national revolution had begun and declared {{the formation of a}} new government with Ludendorff. Retiring to a back room, Hitler, with handgun drawn, demanded <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> support of Kahr, Seisser, and Lossow. Hitler's forces initially succeeded in occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters, but Kahr and his cohorts quickly withdrew their support. Neither the army, nor the state police, joined forces with Hitler. The next day, Hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the Bavarian War Ministry to overthrow the Bavarian government, but police dispersed them. Sixteen NSDAP members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup.|$|E

5|$|The next match, between The Big Boss Man and Nailz, was a nightstick on a pole match. A nightstick was {{suspended}} above {{the ring and}} {{could be used as}} a weapon once it was retrieved. Nailz began the match by attempting to get the nightstick, but Boss Man stopped him. Nailz choked Boss Man before making another unsuccessful attempt to climb the pole and obtain the nightstick. Boss Man punched Nailz and then tried to climb the pole. Nailz stopped him, performed a back body drop, and choked Boss Man again. Boss Man regained control but missed a splash, which gave Nailz another chance to retrieve the nightstick. Both men clotheslined each other, but Boss Man recovered first <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> nightstick. He hit Nailz with it, but Nailz took it and used it against Boss Man. Boss Man performed the Boss Man slam, his finishing move, before pinning Nailz to win the match.|$|E
5|$|Zito {{made his}} major league debut on July 22, 2000, against the Anaheim Angels wearing #53. He allowed one run in five innings, <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> win. In his next start, Zito went seven innings while giving up three {{runs to the}} Boston Red Sox. Zito {{continued}} to have great success early in his rookie season. In his third career start, he went seven innings and gave up one run against the Toronto Blue Jays. On September 10, Zito pitched his first complete game shutout against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He threw 110 pitches, struck out eight, and allowed five hits. During the month of September, he went 5–1 with a 1.73 ERA. Zito finished with a 7–4 record and a 2.72 earned run average in 14 starts. Despite his late start to the season, Zito still finished fifth in American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award voting.|$|E
5|$|In December, {{the deputies}} {{of the other}} provinces convened by the {{circular}} of May 27 arrived to Buenos Aires. Most of them were closer to the ideas of Saavedra, and Gregorio Funes became highly influential over them. They did not agree about which body they should join: the deputies wanted to join the Junta, while Moreno thought that they should start a constituent assembly. Funes, allied with Saavedra, calculated that they could stop Moreno by joining the Junta, as his proposals would be agreed to by a minority. The Junta, with both its original members and the deputies, discussed the topic on December 18. Funes said that Buenos Aires {{had no right to}} rule the other provinces without their consent, <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> support of the other members. He said that there was popular discontent with the Junta. The supporters of Moreno said that such discontent was only among some rebels, and Moreno said that it was only the discontent of the Patricians in respect of the Suppressions decree. However, only Paso voted with him, and the deputies joined the Junta. Moreno resigned, but his resignation was rejected. His opposition to the incorporation of the deputies is seen by some historians as an initial step in the conflict between Buenos Aires and the other provinces, which dominated politics in Argentina during the following decades. Some call it a precursor of the Unitarian Party, while others find his words or actions more consistent with the Federal Party. However, historians Paul Groussac and Norberto Piñeiro feel it is inappropriate to extrapolate so far into the future. Piñeiro considered it an error to label Moreno as federal or unitary, proving that this organization been prioritized over the secondary aspect of centralism or federalism, while Groussac similarly notes that Moreno devoted all his energies to the immediate problem of achieving independence without giving much thought to possible long-term scenarios.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the episode, each contestant were given a bag of trinkets including postcards depicting Miami, Tahiti, and St. Tropez.

Their mission was to build a cabana inspired by the postcard in 16 hours, with resources from Pier One Imports only. Since Erik won the last competition, he could not be eliminated during this challenge. This worried Matt, as he could be eliminated a lot easier being on a team with only two viable targets as opposed to three.|$|R

5|$|The Cardinals won the toss {{and decided}} to receive. On the opening kickoff, David Johnson {{returned}} it 108 yards for a touchdown. After both teams exchanged punts, receiver Josh Bellamy caught a 48-yard touchdown pass from Cutler, his first career touchdown reception. On the Cardinals' ensuing drive, the Bears forced fourth down after Palmer's pass to Johnson went out of bounds, but was reversed after it was determined he had a knee and elbow inbounds. Two plays later, Arizona gained 42 yards on Palmer's pass to John Brown, added with a defensive pass interference penalty on corner Kyle Fuller, placing the offense at the Bears' 11-yard line. After two plays, Palmer threw a six-yard touchdown pass to Jaron Brown. On Chicago's next drive, runningback Jeremy Langford scored on a one-yard dive. However, the Cardinals scored two touchdowns in 52 seconds: after Larry Fitzgerald's eight-yard touchdown reception, Tony Jefferson intercepted Cutler, scoring on the 26-yard return. Cutler tried to dive to tackle Jefferson, but landed on his right shoulder and suffered a hamstring injury; Jimmy Clausen replaced Cutler {{for the rest of}} the game. Despite losing Cutler, the Bears were able to score three points with Robbie Gould's 40-yard field goal, <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> ball back on the next drive with linebacker Jared Allen intercepting Palmer's pass intended for J. J. Nelson on the first play; however, the Bears had to settle for Gould's 23-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Clausen's pass for Marquess Wilson was intercepted by Patrick Peterson, with the Cardinals capitalizing on the turnover with Palmer's 28-yard touchdown pass to Fitzgerald. After the Bears punted, Arizona increased the score with Johnson's 13-yard touchdown run. Gould eventually kicked a 51-yard field goal to make the score 42–23, but Fitzgerald caught another touchdown pass, this time of nine yards, to widen the margin by 25 points, though Chandler Catanzaro's extra point was wide left.|$|E
