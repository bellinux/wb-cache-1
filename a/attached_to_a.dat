5|$|A {{downline}} {{used for}} open ocean diving {{is much the}} same as a shotline, but does not reach {{all the way to the}} bottom. An open-ocean downline is weighted at the bottom, and <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> substantial float at the surface, which may be tethered to the boat. It may be marked at intervals by knots or loops, and may be attached to decompression trapeze system. In some cases a sea anchor may be used to limit wind drift, particularly if <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> boat with significant windage.|$|E

5|$|If {{appropriate}} {{electrical contacts}} are <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> nanotube, electron-hole pairs (excitons) {{can be generated}} by injecting electrons and holes from the contacts. Subsequent exciton recombination results in electroluminescence (EL). Electroluminescent devices have been produced from single nanotubes and their macroscopic assemblies. Recombination appears to proceed via triplet-triplet annihilation giving distinct peaks corresponding to E11 and E22 transitions.|$|E

One set (often referred to in Mayan grammars as set A) indicates the person of subjects of intransitive verbs, and of objects of transitive verbs. They {{can also be used}} with adjective or noun predicates to indicate the subject.|$|E

5|$|The {{relative}} {{reactivity of}} zinc {{and its ability}} to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe. Zinc acts as the anode (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline. Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water. A zinc disc <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> ship's iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact. Similarly, a zinc plug <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides temporary protection.|$|E

5|$|The two nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, are {{polymers}} of nucleotides. Each nucleotide {{is composed}} of a phosphate <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> ribose or deoxyribose sugar group which is <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> nitrogenous base. Nucleic acids are critical for the storage and use of genetic information, and its interpretation through the processes of transcription and protein biosynthesis. This information is protected by DNA repair mechanisms and propagated through DNA replication. Many viruses have an RNA genome, such as HIV, which uses reverse transcription to create a DNA template from its viral RNA genome. RNA in ribozymes such as spliceosomes and ribosomes is similar to enzymes as it can catalyze chemical reactions. Individual nucleosides are made by attaching a nucleobase to a ribose sugar. These bases are heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen, classified as purines or pyrimidines. Nucleotides also act as coenzymes in metabolic-group-transfer reactions.|$|E

5|$|All {{versions}} of the Su-25 have a metal cantilever wing, of moderate sweep, high aspect ratio and equipped with high-lift devices. The wing consists of two cantilever sections <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> central torsion box, forming a single unit with the fuselage. The air brakes are housed in fairings {{at the tip of}} each wing. Each wing has five hardpoints for weapons carriage, with the attachment points mounted on load-bearing ribs and spars. Each wing also features a five-section leading edge slat, a two-section flap and an aileron.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew {{it lightly}} first to subdue it. They {{typically}} have small hinged pedicellate teeth, a feature unique to amphibians. The base and crown {{of these are}} composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals. Salamanders, caecilians and some frogs {{have one or two}} rows of teeth in both jaws, but some frogs (Rana spp.) lack teeth in the lower jaw, and toads (Bufo spp.) have no teeth. In many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> facial bone in the roof of the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Another {{alternative}} landing {{concept was}} the US Air Force's proposal to attach wings to the spacecraft. This proposal arose {{soon after the}} cancellation of the X-20 Dyna-Soar, and would have seen a Gemini spacecraft <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> set of wings developed during the ASSET program. This would have been launched by a Titan II rocket, {{and would have been}} unable to maneuver in orbit. Another proposal saw the spacecraft being launched by a Titan IIIA or IIIC, using the Transtage for maneuvering. Once the mission was complete, the spacecraft would have been deorbited by means of five solid rocket motors.|$|E

5|$|Born in London, he {{emigrated to}} New Zealand after leaving school, {{where he worked}} as a surveyor. He joined a {{volunteer}} militia unit in 1893, and went to South Africa as an officer with the first New Zealand contingent sent to the Boer War in 1899. He later commanded the third, fourth and eighth contingents, becoming the first New Zealand officer to command an independent unit on active service overseas. Following his return to New Zealand, he became inspector-general of the New Zealand Military Forces, and in 1909 was <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> British Army brigade to gain staff experience.|$|E
5|$|Charles Eaton {{was born}} on 21December 1895 in Lambeth, London, the son of William Walpole Eaton, a butcher, and his wife Grace. Schooled in Wandsworth, Charles worked in Battersea Town Council {{from the age of}} fourteen, before joining the London Regiment upon the {{outbreak}} of World WarI in August 1914. <b>Attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bicycle company in the 24th Battalion of the 47th Division, he arrived at the Western Front in March 1915. He took part in trench bombing missions and attacks on enemy lines of communication, seeing action in the Battles of Aubers Ridge, Festubert, Loos, and the Somme.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{diminutive}} size, the Church of St Nicholas {{was probably}} not constructed as an independent church. A legend links the church to {{the name of an}} unidentified local feudal lord named Nikola (Nicholas) as his final resting place, though archaeologist Nikola Mavrodinov considers it more likely that it was possibly a chapel or a cemetery church <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> larger place of worship. The larger church was perhaps pulled down during the early Ottoman rule of Bulgaria (post-14th century). While the Church of St Nicholas was not destroyed, its renovation was prohibited by the Ottomans, thus it gradually fell into ruin.|$|E
