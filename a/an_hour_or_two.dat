5|$|Horses must {{lie down}} to reach REM sleep. They {{only have to}} lie down for <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements. However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may {{suddenly}} collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing. This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.|$|E
5|$|By 1969, Clarence13X {{became very}} tired and slept little. He feared {{that he would}} be killed and {{instructed}} his followers to remain strong if he died. On June12, he spent time with several of his disciples at their school. He left the school between 2:00 and 3:00 am on June 13 and then gambled for <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> As was his occasional practice, he traveled to Dora Smith's house to rest. He was ambushed by three assailants who fatally shot him {{while he was in the}} lobby of her apartment building. That morning, several people from the mayor's office met with his family, and the mayor later visited the Five Percenters' school to express condolences.|$|E

60|$|When Moran {{relieved}} him, Jimmy felt worn out. He had {{had only}} <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two’s</b> sleep after <b>a</b> day of exhausting work; his breakfast had {{consisted of a}} morsel of stale, cold fish, hurriedly torn with his fingers from the lump in the pan; and they had had no opportunity for cooking dinner.|$|R
50|$|The town is well placed, within <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two's</b> {{drive from}} {{the west coast of}} Eyre Peninsula but still close enough for a day trip to the Gawler Ranges.

25|$|Preparation for Easter {{begins with}} the season of Great Lent. In {{addition}} to fasting, almsgiving, and prayer, Orthodox Christians cut down on all entertainment and non-essential worldly activities, gradually eliminating them until Great and Holy Friday, the most austere day of the year.

I am content, however, at present, with his simplifying assurance that of violet and pansy together, [...] "six species grow wild in Britain--or, as some believe, only four--while the analysts run the number up to fifteen." ...|$|R
60|$|It was blazing {{hot that}} afternoon, {{and the wide}} plain lay {{scorching}} under a pitiless glare. Thorne was not sorry when the Farquhar homestead with its encircling sea of wheat took shape ahead. The trail led past it, and, though time was precious to him then, {{he felt that he}} could put up with <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two's</b> delay in case Mrs. Farquhar invited him to wait for supper.

25|$|Cricket is {{also played}} in several {{different}} shortened forms, designed to pack as much action as possible into <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> enabling them to be played as a single contest in an evening, or {{as a series of}} multiple contests between different teams that cover the entire day. Such forms have evolved since the 1980s, and take cricket an additional step beyond one-day cricket. Most forms will resemble twenty-twenty cricket in nature, although shorter formats with reduced numbers of players, typically 6-aside or 8-aside, are also common for tournament play.|$|E
25|$|When {{the police}} left without their prisoners, the {{fighting}} {{stopped for a}} few moments. The truce lasted only <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> as fighting resumed near The Tombs, supposedly brought about {{by a group of}} women from the Five Points who had provoked the Dead Rabbits into attacking the Bowery gangs. Bringing reinforcements, the participants were estimated at between 800 and 1000, armed with bludgeons, paving stones, brick bats, axes, pitchforks, and other weapons. Several hundred other criminals also arrived in the area, mostly burglars and thieves, who were not affiliated with either side and simply took the opportunity for looting. Residents and store owners all along the Bowery were forced to barricade their buildings and protect themselves with pistols and muskets.|$|E
25|$|On December 14, 2015 at {{approximately}} 15:45 the Spence suffered a sudden 25 degree list to starboard while in towing the Guantanamo Bay Express barge from a shipyard in Cartahena, Columbia {{where it had}} recently been overhauled and repaired to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to resume its normal resupply mission. The crew, unable to correct the list and fearing that the vessel would sink, abandoned ship by coming alongside the barge and jumping over to its deck. At around 17:30 the tug, still tethered to the barge with three 1,600 ft. tow lines, sank below the surface. <b>An</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> later, the crew heard three sharp bangs which {{are assumed to be}} the tow lines breaking as the tug sank beyond the length of the tow lines on its way to settling to the bottom 11,500 feet below the surface. The crew were rescued by the coast guard cutter Decisive early in the morning of December 15.|$|E
60|$|Upon the whole, {{the days}} pass pleasantly enough--work till one <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> then <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two's</b> {{walk in the}} snow, then lighter work, or reading. Late dinner, and singing or chat in the evening. Mathews has really all the will, {{as well as the}} talent, to be amusing. He {{confirms}} my idea of ventriloquism (which is an absurd word), as being merely the art of imitating sounds at a greater or less distance, assisted by some little points of trick to influence the imagination of the audience--the vulgar idea of a peculiar organisation (beyond fineness of ear and of utterance) is nonsense.|$|R

60|$|As for myself, I felt {{as much as}} any of the party, but {{preserved}} more self-command. I saw it was now {{necessary to}} quit that vicinity, and to take some definite steps for the preservation of my own ship and property. There was little to apprehend, however, from the frigates, unless indeed it should fall calm. In the latter case, they might board us with their boats, which <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two's</b> work would probably enable them to use again. But I had no intention of remaining in their neighbourhood, being desirous of profiting by the present wind.|$|R
25|$|Towards 1:00 pm, in {{the thick}} mix of gun smoke and fog {{covering}} the field, the king was separated from his fellow riders and suffered multiple shots. A bullet crushed his left arm below the elbow. Almost simultaneously his horse suffered a shot to the neck that {{made it hard to}} control. In the mix of fog and smoke from the burning town of Lützen the king rode astray behind enemy lines. There he sustained yet another shot in the back, was stabbed and fell from his horse. Lying on the ground, he received a final, fatal shot to the temple. His fate remained unknown for some time. However, when the gunnery paused and the smoke cleared, his horse was spotted between the two lines, Gustavus himself not on it and nowhere to be seen. His disappearance stopped the initiative of the hitherto successful Swedish right wing, while a search was conducted. His partly stripped body was found <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> later, and was secretly evacuated from the field in a Swedish artillery wagon.|$|E
25|$|In June 1880, {{while the}} Republican Convention was in session in Chicago, former General and President Grant {{and his family}} were living in Galena. After being persuaded by his wife and {{political}} friends to stand for a nomination and run for office a third time, he finally consented. Grant would come down town in the morning on a daily basis and would spent <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> with Judge Rowley, now an old friend and former comrade, at his office, and would often talk about his recent tour around the world. During the convention Rowley's office would receive many telegrams, and while Rowley and others would receive them with great interest, Grant showed little, until one arrived with some descending news about an old trusted friend, Elihu B. Washburne, also on the list of presidential nominations. Washburne, now a competitor of Grant, was withdrawing his support and making disparaging statements about Grant, which ultimately ended their long friendship. While Grant received the news in his usual calm manner, Rowley and others, however, were very outspoken with their denunciation of Washburne.|$|E
500|$|The {{shipyard}} generated high {{employment to}} Jarrow, but the industrial works created a harsh environment. Ellen Wilkinson, the town's historian {{and member of}} parliament from 1935 to 1947, quotes a newspaper source from 1858: [...] "There is a prevailing blackness about the neighbourhood. The houses are black, the ships are black, the sky is black, {{and if you go}} there for <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> reader, you will be black". According to Wilkinson, the yard's founder, Sir Charles Palmer, [...] "regarded it as no part of his duty to see that the conditions under which his workers had to live were either sanitary or tolerable".|$|E

60|$|Dinner {{that evening}} {{was not a}} {{particularly}} lively affair; the strain of trying to impersonate a self-imposed character or to glean hints of identity from other people’s conduct acted as {{a check on the}} natural festivity of such a gathering. There was a general feeling of gratitude and acquiescence when good-natured Rachel Klammerstein suggested that there should be <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two’s</b> respite from “the game” while they all listened to a little piano-playing after dinner. Rachel’s love of piano music was not indiscriminate, and concentrated itself chiefly on selections rendered by her idolised offspring, Moritz and Augusta, who, to do them justice, played remarkably well.|$|R
500|$|Covering {{the event}} for Doctor Who Magazine, David Darlington {{noted that the}} stated aim of the Proms is [...] "to {{encourage}} an audience for concert hall music who, though not normally attending classical concerts, would be attracted by the low ticket prices and informal atmosphere" [...] and concluded that if {{the children in the}} audience had such a love for Doctor Who [...] "that they have come all this way to spend <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> listening to the music from the show, and that they will happily also sit through a formal, experimental and rather abrasive piece of modern classical music and then enthusiastically applaud at the end, then all concerned can be happy with their day's work." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{short story}} by Simo Matavulj, titled [...] "Zduhač", Matavulj acts as the {{companion}} and translator for a French vicomte who goes to hunt bears near a mountainous village in Old Herzegovina (part of Montenegro). One of their escort is Mićun, a burly young man from the village, who falls into a trance during a storm. The vicomte is given the explanation that Mićun, being a zduhać, leaves his body {{to fight in the}} clouds against alien zduhaći. After <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> the zduhać wakes up exhausted. Another man of the escort asks him, [...] "Was it good for us?" [...] to which Mićun answers affirmatively. The vicomte concludes the story by quoting Hamlet's well-known lines about the secret things of heaven and earth (Hamlet, [...] ).|$|E
500|$|King George was {{extremely}} devoted to Octavius, who {{was too young}} to cause the kinds of trouble that his elder brothers were by the year of his birth. The king was affectionate and indulgent with his young children, and strove to attend their birthday parties and other events organized for their merriment; on one occasion a friend witnessed a happy domestic scene that involved George [...] "carrying about in his arms by turns Sophia and the last prince, Octavius." [...] Another witness wrote George and Charlotte [...] "have their Children always playing about them the whole time"; during most evenings the children were brought to their parents between 6 and 7 O'clock to play for <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> The king also was kept informed of his children's educational progress.|$|E
60|$|He {{found the}} waiting dreary {{when he reached}} open water, for he was filled with keen impatience to get to work. The gold lay in sight in the hold of the wreck, and <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two’s</b> labor {{was all that was}} {{required}} to transfer it to the sloop. And it was obvious that this must be done at once, because the drift ice was gathering in the offing, and an on-shore breeze might suddenly spring up. They had nowhere to run for shelter, now that the only safe haven was closed to them. Still, Jimmy felt that he had done wisely in exercising self-control enough to send for the water.|$|R

60|$|He {{understood}} me at once, {{and reminded}} me of the practical distinction betwixt catching the animals as an object of cruel and wanton sport, and eating them as lawful and gratifying articles of food, after they were killed. On the latter point he had no scruples; but, on the contrary, assured me that this brook contained the real red trout, so highly esteemed by all connoisseurs, and that, when eaten within <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> of their being caught, they had a peculiar firmness of substance and delicacy of flavour, which rendered them an agreeable addition to a morning meal, especially when earned, like ours, by early rising, and <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two's</b> wholesome exercise.|$|R
