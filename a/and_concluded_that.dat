40|$|This article argues against {{laws which}} mandate that {{candidates}} {{and elected officials}} reside in a particular geographic area {{as a condition of}} election or office-holding (i. e., residency requirements).

The article also considers the costs of residency requirements <b>and</b> <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> the costs of such requirements outweigh any purported benefits. The article then ponders why residency requirements have continued to exist despite weak justifications for their use, <b>and</b> <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> residency requirements likely persist because they insulate incumbent partisans from electoral competition. As such, a politics as markets approach might suggest the elimination of residency requirements...|$|R

5|$|Amid rising {{concerns}} over {{the threat of a}} French invasion, Sir Thomas Page surveyed the blockhouse in 1778 <b>and</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> its guns were too closely packed together and that they could not easily fire down-river, proposing that a larger fort be built along the Thames to the east to rectify this problem. New Tavern Fort was constructed shortly afterwards and the eastern Gravesend Blockhouse gun platform was redesigned and extended as part of the work. Two volunteer militia companies were established in 1794 and 1797 to support the blockhouse and in 1805 it was equipped with 19 32 lb guns.|$|E
5|$|Corythosaurus was an ornithopod, and {{therefore}} a herbivore. Benson et al. (2012) realized that the beak of Corythosaurus was shallow and delicate, <b>and</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> {{it must have been}} used to feed upon soft vegetation. Based on the climate of the Late Cretaceous, they guessed that Corythosaurus would have been a selective feeder, eating only the juiciest fruits and youngest leaves. Corythosaurus specimens have been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity. Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits, meaning that Corythosaurus probably fed on all of these.|$|E

The same vajralepa plaster {{can also be found}} in Sari, Kalasan and Sewu temples.
