40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relation}} between managerial share ownership (MSO) and discretionary accruals in Australia. We find a positive relation between MSO and discretionary accruals {{up to a certain}} level of MSO followed by a negative relation (inverse U-shaped). We suggest that these unique results are a result of certain Australian institutional features that are markedly different to those in the US and the UK and imply that the ownership-discretionary accruals relation is context specific with the wider corporate governance systems influencing the theorised incentive effects. We also posit that executive directors and independent directors have different ownership-discretionary <b>accruals</b> <b>incentives</b> and report results consistent with this proposition. <br /...|$|R
40|$|We {{undertake}} a broad-based {{study of the}} effect of managerial risk-taking incentives on corporate financial policies and show that the risk-taking incentives of chief executive officers (CEOs) and chief financial officers (CFOs) significantly influence their firms' financial policies. In particular, we find that CEOs' risk-decreasing (-increasing) incentives are associated with lower (higher) leverage and higher (lower) cash balances. CFOs' risk-decreasing (-increasing) incentives are associated with safer (riskier) debt-maturity choices and higher (lower) earnings-smoothing through accounting accruals. We exploit the stock option expensing regulation of 2004 to establish a causal link between managerial incentives and corporate policies. Our findings have important implications for optimal corporate compensation design. Capital structure Cash balance Debt maturity <b>Accrual</b> <b>Incentives...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} pension {{programme}} incentives on retirement in Denmark are analysed in an option value framework. Using eligibility criteria and detailed entitlement {{rules for the}} five main publicly funded retirement programmes, we calculate social security wealth, one year pension <b>accrual</b> and forward-looking <b>incentive</b> measures. Estimation results from an option value analysis are used to simulate the expected outcome from a set of strategic reforms of retirement policy.

40|$|Taxation {{of capital}} gains upon {{realization}} instead of <b>accrual</b> provides <b>incentives</b> to hold winners {{as long as}} possible and sell losers immediately. This so called lock-in effect possibly distorts the liquidation and investment decision and hence is usually regarded to be harmful. The paper analyzes the impact the method of taxation has on asset prices and welfare within a simple general equilibrium model of an exchange economy. It is shown that a switch from an accrual to a realization based tax system generally results in rising asset prices. However, contrary to conventional wisdom, total welfare does not necessarily decrease. 1 1 The basic problem of capital gains taxation In most of the world’s economies changes in the value of an investor’s asset (or entire portfolio) are subject to a tax, the so called capital gains tax. There are basically two different methods of collecting this tax: taxation o...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{relation}} between auditor litigation risk and abnormal accruals over the 1989 - 2007 time period. We address potential endogeneity in prior studies by jointly modeling abnormal accruals and litigation risk in a simultaneous equation system. Our findings suggest that client-specific litigation risk affects auditor incentives to acquiesce to client demands for earnings management, i. e., the higher the risk of auditor litigation, the greater the auditor’s restraining influence on the abnormal accruals reported by the client. We also find evidence that abnormal accruals {{increase the likelihood of}} auditor litigation. We also document that the 1995 Public Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) lowered the client-specific risk of auditor litigation. Litigation reform remains a topic of ongoing interest. Our findings contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the effects of litigation reform (and related changes in legal exposure) on auditor incentives and earnings management. : Litigation risk, abnormal <b>accruals,</b> auditor <b>incentives...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{study how}} a stock index can affect {{corporate}} behavior by {{functioning as a}} source of prestige. After decades of low corporate profitability, the JPX-Nikkei 400 index was introduced in Japan in 2014. Each year the index selected 400 large and liquid firms deemed to be best-performing in terms of profitability; membership is considered highly prestigious. We document that index-inclusion incentives have led firms to increase return on equity proportionally by 41 %, via higher margins, efficiency, or shareholder payouts, depending on where they had slack, but not by changing investments or <b>accruals.</b> These <b>incentives</b> are driven by the prestige associated with the index, rather than capital-market benefits. Back-of-the-envelope estimates suggest that the index-inclusion incentives accounted for 16 % of the average increase in aggregate annual earnings over our sample period and 20 % of the growth in aggregate market capitalization. These findings shed light on a novel mechanism by which longstanding corporate behaviors can be transformed...|$|R
40|$|A {{long and}} still growing strand of the {{retirement}} literature examines the role financial incentives {{play in the}} timing of the retirement decision. A more recent second strand of work has focused on the role of health shocks in the retirement decision. This paper combines these two components of the literature in order to measure the marginal impact of current wealth (including pension <b>accrual),</b> forward-looking financial <b>incentives</b> (peak-value pension wealth), and health shocks on married individuals’ retirement decision. This paper helps to clarify whether previously omitted forward-looking financial incentives can explain the strong role attributed to health shocks in the retirement decisions of coupled individuals. We find that financial incentives are the most important determinant of retirement behavior empirically. A husband is about half as responsive to his wife’s financial incentives as he is to his own. Interestingly, we find that married men are responsive to their wives’ health shocks, on both the intensive and extensive margin, but find wives’ decisions concerning work are largely unaffected by their husbands’ health shocks. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies {{monitoring}} and accrual measurement in a principal-agent setting. The {{advantage of the}} principal-agent setting {{is that it allows}} accrual measurement to be explicitly connected to {{monitoring and}} to encompass questions of managerial behaviour and communication incentives. It also allows the analysis to take place in a setting where competing and complementary sources of information are available. Here the accrual measurement is used to discipline other, perhaps more timely, sources of information and to carry information itself. The argument rests on a two-period agency setting. The usual moral hazard story is expanded to include the agent also observing. a potential project opportunity (e. g. an additional customer, a labour-saving opportunity or whatever). This creates an interest in monitoring the agent's project selection. This monitoring may, it turns out, be useful for purposes of controlling the familiar short-run versus long-run tension or for better managing short-run <b>incentives.</b> <b>Accrual</b> questions enter in terms of allocating the project's up-front cost across the two periods, thereby separating expenditure from expense. In information-content terms, though, this turns out, given that cashflow is observed, to be equivalent to a monitor story that reports on project selection. ...|$|R
40|$|The labor {{participation}} rate in Slovenia has been {{lower than in}} the EU- 15 (the members states prior to May 2004), particularly for the low-income and older individuals. Using simulations of tax and social benefits and public pensions, the paper shows how the current tax, welfare, and pension systems create disincentives to work among these groups. The paper finds that incentives to retire early are strong for men, especially low-wage earners. The marginal effective tax rates also make it costly for low-income individuals to work and negatively affect the probability of participating. The paper proposes reform measures to enhance work incentives and labor participation, which will be crucial for dealing with population aging and for achieving higher potential growth in Slovenia.

40|$|China’s {{stock markets}} {{have become the}} second {{largest in the world}} after that of the United States. Both the Chinese {{institutional}} setting and the behaviors of the populous Chinese investors and listed firms provide novel opportunities to explore the classical theories in the field of economics and finance. Using two natural experiments, this thesis attempts to shed new light on these theories. The local bias puzzle was originally proposed from the analysis of investors’ investment portfolios. In the first essay, I test and confirm the hypothesis that local bias has already existed in investor attention subconsciously regardless of their investment. In contrast to literature which focuses on investment accounts, I examine local bias in investor attention by analyzing investor messages posted on China’s Internet stock message boards. I find that individual investors {{pay more attention to the}} stocks of local companies. This finding is strong and robust to local-bias proxy variables. By examining factors that affect investor attention local bias, I find that local bias is particularly strong in underdeveloped regions, for SOEs, for small-investor base and low-turnover stocks, and for stocks with name indicating locality. Furthermore, distance plays a significant role: the marginal effect of local bias is much stronger for distances within 500 kilometers. All these results are consistent with my explanation that local bias is affected by factors which can attract investors’ attention. Thus, investment local bias is the natural consequence of investor attention local bias, and I attribute the local bias puzzle to limited investor attention. Chinese stock market has plunged into an unlocking flood of non-tradable shares since June 2006. This radical transition provides a unique natural experimental setting to ascertain earnings management incentives. In the second essay, I explore whether earnings management behavior exists in listed Chinese firms during the unlocking process. I find that non-tradable shareholders opportunistically manipulate earnings upward to offset price pressures for subsequent selling. Firms have higher levels of <b>accruals</b> when unlocking <b>incentive</b> is higher. Furthermore, actual selling incentive is higher in firms which have higher levels of accruals. The results document a novel case that equity incentives give rise to the incidence of earnings management. published_or_final_versionEconomics and FinanceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
