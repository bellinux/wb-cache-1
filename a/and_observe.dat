30|$|If the {{observed}} area {{is defined as}} spatial reference field, <b>and</b> the <b>observed</b> period as temporal receptive window, a computation of the <b>observed</b> study area <b>and</b> the <b>observed</b> study period based on the receptors involved in the observation process becomes possible. An example of computation of <b>observed</b> study area <b>and</b> <b>observed</b> study period based on the spatial receptive field, and the temporal receptive window is provided in [53] (Chapter 5). Specifying <b>observed</b> area, <b>and</b> <b>observed</b> period based on the spatial receptive field, and the temporal receptive window respectively leads to a definition of the <b>observed</b> study area <b>and</b> the <b>observed</b> study period based on {{the properties of the}} observation process as Frank’s [16] desideratum (see Section The receptor-centric approach) expressed. In the absence of information about the spatial receptive field, and temporal receptive window, the spatial and temporal supports may be used as criteria to characterize the <b>observed</b> area <b>and</b> <b>observed</b> period <b>and</b> compute the <b>observed</b> study area <b>and</b> <b>observed</b> study period (one should be aware of supports’ drawbacks discussed in Section The property-centric approach though).|$|R

5|$|A second {{satellite}} studio, Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida, {{opened in}} 1989 with 40 employees. Its offices were {{located within the}} Disney-MGM Studios theme park at Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida, and visitors were allowed to tour the studio <b>and</b> <b>observe</b> animators at work. That same year, the studio released The Little Mermaid, which became a keystone achievement in Disney's history as its largest critical and commercial success in decades. Directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, who'd been co-directors on The Great Mouse Detective, The Little Mermaid earned $84 million at the North American box office, a record for the studio. The film was built around a score from Broadway songwriters Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, {{who was also a}} co-producer and story consultant on the film. The Little Mermaid won two Academy Awards, for Best Original Song and for Best Original Score.|$|E
30|$|In sum, <b>observed</b> {{study area}} <b>and</b> <b>observed</b> study period {{should always be}} {{documented}} when manipulating average values. The general rule that a comparison of average values requires similar observed study areas/periods is an axiom, which can used to check the consistency of information stored in (sensor web or) geographic information systems. This work has {{provided the basis for}} assessing the <b>observed</b> study area <b>and</b> <b>observed</b> study period of observation collections. Both criteria are derived from the <b>observed</b> areas <b>and</b> <b>observed</b> periods respectively (see Section Spatial and temporal resolution of an observation collection). The <b>observed</b> areas <b>and</b> <b>observed</b> periods can be estimated using the spatial receptive fields and temporal receptive windows of the observers - in this case the monitoring stations in Europe - which produced the observations.|$|R

5|$|Although {{well above}} the draft age at 41 years old, Cooper enlisted for service in the United States Army in World War II in 1942. Immediately offered an officer's commission, he chose instead to enlist as a private. After basic training, he {{enrolled}} in Officer Candidate School at the Fort Custer Training Center in Michigan. He studied military government and graduated second in his class of 111 students. In 1943, he was commissioned a second lieutenant and assigned to the XV Corps of General George Patton's Third Army as a courier in the military police. Cooper served in France, Luxembourg, and Germany. After liberating the Buchenwald concentration camp, Patton ordered {{the entire population of}} the nearby city of Weimar to go through it <b>and</b> <b>observe</b> the conditions; Cooper also viewed the camp at that time.|$|E
5|$|From the 13th to 20th century, {{there were}} Swedish-speaking {{communities}} in Estonia, {{particularly on the}} islands (e.g., Hiiumaa, Vormsi, Ruhnu; in Swedish, known as Dagö, Ormsö, Runö, respectively) {{along the coast of}} the Baltic, communities which today have all disappeared. The Swedish-speaking minority was represented in parliament, and entitled to use their native language in parliamentary debates. After the loss of Estonia to the Russian Empire in the early 18th century, around 1,000 Estonian Swedish speakers were forced to march to southern Ukraine, where they founded a village, Gammalsvenskby ("Old Swedish Village"). A few elderly people in the village still speak Swedish <b>and</b> <b>observe</b> the holidays of the Swedish calendar, although the dialect is most likely facing extinction.|$|E

After being contacted to compose the score by the game's director Masato Kato, Mitsuda decided to center his work around old world cultural influences, including Mediterranean, Fado, Celtic, and percussive African music. To complement the theme of parallel worlds, he gave the songs for the two worlds of the game, Another and Home, respectively dark and bright moods. Mitsuda was happy to accomplish even half of what he envisioned. Once production concluded, Mitsuda played Chrono Cross to record his impressions <b>and</b> <b>observe</b> how the tracks intermingled with scenes.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of extraterrestrial intelligence would have various impacts on biology and astrobiology. The {{discovery of}} extraterrestrial life in any form, intelligent or non-intelligent, would give humanity greater {{insight into the}} nature of life on Earth and would improve the conception of how the tree of life is organized. Human biologists could learn about extraterrestrial biochemistry <b>and</b> <b>observe</b> how it differs from that found on Earth. This knowledge could help human civilization to learn which aspects of life are common throughout the universe and which are specific to Earth.|$|E
5|$|Water clocks, or Fenjaan, in Persia {{reached a}} level of {{accuracy}} comparable to today's standards of timekeeping. The fenjaan was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from a qanat or well for irrigation of the farms, until it was replaced by more accurate current clock. Persian water clocks were a practical and useful tool for the qanat's shareholders to calculate {{the length of time}} they could divert water to their farm. The qanat was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation so a just and fair water distribution was very important. Therefore, a very fair and clever old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock, and at least two full-time managers were needed to control <b>and</b> <b>observe</b> the number of fenjaans and announce the exact time during the days and nights.|$|E

5|$|During their {{terrestrial}} phase, crested and marbled newts {{depend on}} a landscape that offers cover, invertebrate prey and humidity. The precise requirements of most species are still poorly known, as the newts are {{much more difficult to}} detect <b>and</b> <b>observe</b> on land. Deciduous woodlands or groves are in general preferred, but conifer woods are also accepted, especially in the far northern and southern ranges. The southern marbled newt is typically found in Mediterranean oak forests. In the absence of forests, other cover-rich habitats, as for example hedgerows, scrub, swampy meadows, or quarries, can be inhabited. Within such habitats, the newts use hiding places such as logs, bark, planks, stone walls, or small mammal burrows; several individuals may occupy such refuges at the same time. Since the newts in general stay very close to their aquatic breeding sites, the quality of the surrounding terrestrial habitat largely determines whether an otherwise suitable water body will be colonised.|$|E
5|$|Emus {{were used}} {{as a source of}} food by {{indigenous}} Australians and early European settlers. Emus are inquisitive birds and have been known to approach humans if they see unexpected movement of a limb or piece of clothing. In the wild, they may follow <b>and</b> <b>observe</b> people. Aboriginal Australians used a variety of techniques to catch the birds, including spearing them while they drank at waterholes, catching them in nets, and attracting them by imitating their calls or by arousing their curiosity with a ball of feathers and rags dangled from a tree. The pitchuri thornapple (Duboisia hopwoodii), or some similar poisonous plant, could be used to contaminate a waterhole, after which the disoriented emus were easy to catch. Another stratagem was for the hunter to use a skin as a disguise, and the birds could be lured into a camouflaged pit trap using rags or imitation calls. Aboriginal Australians only killed emus out of necessity, and frowned on anyone who hunted them for any other reason. Every part of the carcass had some use; the fat was harvested for its valuable, multiple-use oil, the bones were shaped into knives and tools, the feathers were used for body adornment and the tendons substituted for string.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} Age, the Age of Eden, the player learns a mysterious entity is {{controlling}} the world's other lifeforms and sending {{them against the}} player. This entity {{turns out to be}} Bolbox, a lifeform that has evolved into a freakish and evil advanced being by consuming the crystals, believing itself to be the first human, but in reality is a gigantic single-celled organism. In the game's final battle, the player and Bolbox fight to determine who will gain entry into Eden and become Gaia's partner. Bolbox is defeated, and the player joins Gaia in Eden and is granted the gift of intelligence. It is also revealed the crystals were introduced to Earth by an advanced civilization on Mars, who misguidedly wished to help Earth by speeding its evolution with the crystals. Upon realizing the dangers the crystals create, the Martians decide to leave Earth alone <b>and</b> <b>observe</b> until it becomes advanced enough for them to interact with.|$|E
