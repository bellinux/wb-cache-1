5|$|After the Austrian {{invasion}} of the Duchy of Warsaw, Russia, bound by the treaty of alliance with France, reluctantly entered the war against Austria. The Russian army {{under the command of}} General Sergei Golitsyn crossed into Galicia on 3 June 1809. Golitsyin advanced <b>as</b> <b>slowly</b> <b>as</b> possible, with instructions to avoid any major confrontation with the Austrians. There were only minor skirmishes between the Russian and Austrian troops, with minimal losses. The Austrian and Russian commanders were in frequent correspondence and, in fact, shared some operational intelligence. A courteous letter sent by a Russian divisional commander, General Andrey Gorchakov, to Archduke Ferdinand was intercepted by the Poles, who sent an original to Emperor Napoleon and a copy to Tsar Alexander. As a result, Alexander had to remove Gorchakov from command. Furthermore, there were constant disagreements between Golitsyn and Poniatowski, with whom the Russians were supposed to cooperate in Galicia. As a result of the Treaty of Schönbrunn, Russia received the Galician district of Tarnopol.|$|E

25|$|On July 3, 1864, {{only three}} weeks before his death, Mulligan {{distinguished}} himself in the Battle of Leetown, fought in and around Leetown, Virginia between Union Maj. Gen. Franz Sigel and Confederate Maj. Gen. Jubal Early. Federal troops were retreating {{in the face of}} Early's relentless advance down the Shenandoah Valley during his Second Valley Campaign. Hoping to buy time to concentrate Union forces and supplies, Sigel ordered Mulligan to hold Leestown for as long as possible. The colonel was only allotted two regiments of infantry (including his old 23rd Illinois), five pieces of artillery, and 1,000 dismounted cavalrymen; he faced six Confederate infantry divisions, five brigades of cavalry and three battalions of artillery. Mulligan was told to expect no help whatsoever; he was to hold as long as possible, then conduct a fighting retreat <b>as</b> <b>slowly</b> <b>as</b> possible to cover the other withdrawing Union units.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{if another}} similar planet orbited at 0.71AU from Alpha CentauriB (so {{that in turn}} Alpha Centauri B {{appeared}} as bright as the Sun seen from the Earth), this hypothetical planet would receive slightly more light from the more luminous Alpha CentauriA, which would shine 4.7 to 7.3 magnitudes dimmer than Alpha CentauriB (or the Sun seen from the Earth), ranging in apparent magnitude between −19.4 (dimmest) and −22.1 (brightest). Thus Alpha CentauriA would appear between 830 and 70 times dimmer than the Sun but some 580 to 6900 times brighter than the full Moon. During the orbital period of such a planet of 0.6(3) a, an observer on the planet would see this intensely bright companion star circle the sky just as humans see with the Solar System's planets. Furthermore, Alpha CentauriA's sidereal period of approximately eighty years means that this star would move through the local ecliptic <b>as</b> <b>slowly</b> <b>as</b> Uranus with its eighty-four year period, but as the orbit of Alpha CentauriA is more elliptical, its apparent magnitude will be far more variable. Although intensely bright to the eye, the overall illumination would not significantly affect climate nor influence normal plant photosynthesis.|$|E
500|$|When not {{hunting for}} prey or a mate, Portia species adopt a special posture, called the [...] "cryptic rest posture", pulling their legs {{in close to}} the body and their palps back beside the chelicerae ("jaws"), which obscures the {{outlines}} of these appendages. When walking, all Portia species have a slow, [...] "choppy" [...] gait that preserves their concealment: pausing often and at irregular intervals; waving their legs continuously and their palps jerkily up and down; and moving each appendage out {{of time with the}} others and continuously varying the speed and timing. Portia′s walk is unlike that of any other spider, and this gait and the spider's fringes gives the appearance of light flickering through the forest canopy and reflecting from a piece of detritus. In Queensland, P. fimbriata walks and waves more jerkily and about twice <b>as</b> <b>slowly</b> <b>as</b> other Portia species, including P. fimbriata in other areas.|$|E

500|$|A {{histological}} {{study by}} Erickson, Norell, Zhongue, {{and others in}} 2009 estimated that Archaeopteryx grew relatively slowly compared to modern birds, presumably because the outermost portions of Archaeopteryx bones appear poorly vascularized; in living vertebrates poorly vascularized bone is correlated with slow growth rate. They also assume that all known skeletons of Archaeopteryx come from juvenile specimens. Because the bones of Archaeopteryx could not be histologically sectioned in a formal skeletochronological (growth ring) analysis, Erickson and colleagues used bone vascularity (porosity) to estimate bone growth rate. They assumed that poorly vascularized bone grows at similar rates in all birds and in Archaeopteryx. The poorly vascularized bone of Archaeopteryx might have grown <b>as</b> <b>slowly</b> <b>as</b> that in a mallard (2.5 micrometres per day) or as fast as that in an ostrich (4.2 micrometres per day). Using this range of bone growth rates, they calculated {{how long it would}} take to [...] "grow" [...] each specimen of Archaeopteryx to the observed size; it may have taken at least 970 days (there were 375 days in a Late Jurassic year) to reach an adult size of [...] The study also found that the avialans Jeholornis and Sapeornis grew relatively slowly, as did the dromaeosaurid Mahakala. The avialans Confuciusornis and Ichthyornis grew relatively quickly, following a growth trend similar to that of modern birds. One of the few modern birds that exhibit slow growth is the flightless kiwi, and the authors speculated that Archaeopteryx and the kiwi had similar basal metabolic rate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We present {{independent}} slow {{feature analysis}} {{as a new}} method for nonlinear blind source separation. It circumvents the indeterminacy of nonlinear independent component analysis by constraining the independent components to be <b>as</b> <b>slowly</b> varying <b>as</b> possible.

The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated on nonlinearly mixed speech data. ...|$|R
