5|$|Station 2 was {{constructed}} in the 1920s and considered significant as a rare surviving example of early 20th-century industrial architecture. It was designed in an industrial Beaux-Arts style, with large arched windows and stringcourse intended {{to prevent it from}} becoming an eyesore given its proximity to affluent communities. It {{was constructed}} with Flemish bond brickwork and decorative limestone elements. It was also constructed to minimize noise and ash pollution. Buildings with such architectural detail were usually found in urban areas, making the Glenwood plant unusual for being far from urban areas {{at the time of its}} construction. The building was divided into three sections: a narrow four-story <b>administration</b> <b>section</b> to the north containing offices; a five-story turbine room containing a large open space with decorated glazed buff brick walls; and a six-story boiler house mainly filled with equipment, topped by six 140-foot smoke stacks (ultimately reaching 265 feet above the floor slab). At the time of its demolition the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation determined that it appeared to meet the criteria for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, triggering an alternative use analysis. Given the building's poor condition after three decades of disuse, the excessive cost of making the building structurally sound prevented any plans to retain or renovate it.|$|E

2500|$|The UDA {{had several}} women's units, which acted {{independent}} of each other. Although they occasionally helped staff roadblocks, the women's units were typically involved in local community work and {{responsible for the}} assembly and delivery of food parcels to UDA prisoners. This {{was a source of}} pride for the UDA. [...] The first women's unit was founded on the Shankill Road by Wendy [...] "Bucket" [...] Millar, whose sons Herbie and James [...] "Sham" [...] Millar would later become prominent UDA members. The UDA women's department was headed by Jean Moore, who also came from the Shankill Road. She had also served {{as the president of the}} women's auxiliary of the Loyalist Association of Workers. Her brother Ingram [...] "Jock" [...] Beckett, one of the UDA's founding members, had been killed in March 1972 by a rival UDA faction in an internal dispute. Moore was succeeded by Hester Dunn of east Belfast, who also ran the public relations and <b>administration</b> <b>section</b> at the UDA headquarters. [...] Wendy Millar's Shankill Road group was a particularly active women's unit, and another was based in Sandy Row, south Belfast, a traditional UDA stronghold. The latter was commanded by Elizabeth [...] "Lily" [...] Douglas. [...] Her teenaged daughter, Elizabeth was one of the members.|$|E

40|$|Tax <b>administration</b> <b>sections</b> {{have always}} formed {{part of the}} tax {{legislation}} in South Africa. South Africans have been warned for years of the introduction of separate legislation to govern the tax <b>administration</b> <b>sections</b> of all the applicable tax Acts. This became a reality {{with the introduction of}} the Tax Administration Act (TAAct) on 1 October 2012. This study will focus on the changes from the Income Tax Act to the Tax Administration Act in relation to assessments, objections, penalties and interest. All the different types of assessments have now been defined under the Tax Administration Act. We also see the introduction of a new type of assessment {{in the form of a}} jeopardy assessment. This type of assessment can be raised by a senior SARS official where the Commissioner is satisfied that the collection of taxes may be in jeopardy. The biggest change regarding objections is the change to the timeframe in which a taxpayer is allowed to lodge an objection. Under the Tax Administration Act, an objection has to be lodged within 30 business days after the date of the assessment and not within 30 business days after the due date as under the Income Tax Act. Furthermore, SARS will now be obliged to provide taxpayers with detailed reasons for assessments. The administrative non-compliance penalties that formed part of the Income Tax Act have now been combined under one chapter in the Tax Administration Act. The biggest change with regard to penalties can be seen in the movement from the additional tax penalty (old 200 % penalties) to the new understatement penalty. Taxpayers will need to ensure that they are aware of the possible implications they may face under the Tax Administration Act. It has now become even more important for taxpayers to seek the advice of qualified tax practitioners when faced with complex tax matters. This will assist the taxpayer in preventing unwanted penalties being raised and would ensure compliance in respect of their tax affairs.
