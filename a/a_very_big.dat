5|$|In 1914, Billy Butlin {{was living}} in Toronto {{with his mother and}} stepfather, when he left school and went to work for Eatons {{department}} store. According to Butlin, one of the best aspects of working for the company was {{that he was able to}} visit their summer camp which gave him his first taste of a real holidayindeed a taste of what was to become <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>big</b> part of his life.|$|E
5|$|In his autobiography, Butlin {{recorded}} {{that his}} mother remarried and emigrated to Canada around 1910 and passenger lists of the period show Bertha travelling to Toronto via Montreal in 1912. For two years Butlin, and his cousin Jimmy Hill boarded with a widow in Bristol. In December 1913 his mother returned and married Charles Robotham in Swindon. Butlin's mother and stepfather then asked him to join them in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He was unhappy at school in Canada, mocked because of his English accent, and he left school at fourteen. Eventually {{he got a job}} as a messenger boy at Eatons, Toronto's largest department store. One of the best aspects of working for the company was {{that he was able to}} visit their summer camp, which gave him his first taste of a real holiday, indeed a taste of what was to become <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>big</b> part of his life. Later he transferred to Eatons advertising department where he drew black and white adverts, while studying at night school twice a week.|$|E

25|$|The canal in Muncy Creek Township brought {{vast amounts}} of goods that were stored in {{warehouses}} in Port Penn and Muncy. The farmers and industrialists of Lycoming County used these warehouses to store their goods before they were sent south on the canal. The chief exports of the county were hogs, wheat, flour, lumber, dried and salted meats, leather and whiskey. Whiskey was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>big</b> business. At least 13 distilleries in the area produced and out put of 1,200 to 1,500gallons of whiskey a day. Muncy Creek Township also was home to a thriving commercial fishing industry. The dam was an ideal point to catch fish. The bottleneck in the river caused by the dam and canal locks caused the fish to be forced into one easy to reach location. Baskets were placed along the dam and locks and tremendous amounts of fish and eels were easily caught. The dams and locks at Port Penn were destroyed by numerous floods in the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley during the late 1800s. This caused the canal to be abandoned as it {{was replaced by the}} railroads. Port Penn was since faded away. There are several homes in the area, but as a hamlet it no longer exists. Parts of Port Penn have been annexed by the borough of Muncy and others are in Muncy Creek Township. Lycoming College and the Muncy Historical Society have spearheaded an effort to uncover the history of Port Penn.|$|E

25|$|The Hungarian {{plan of the}} Spring Campaign, {{elaborated}} by Antal Vetter, {{was that}} the 7th corps, under the lead of András Gáspár, had {{to attract the attention}} of Windisch-Grätz on his troops by making and attack from the direction of Hatvan, while the other three corps (I., II., III.) would encircle the Austrian forces from South West, and cut them from the capital cities (Pest and Buda). According to the plan, the 7th corps had to stay at Hatvan until 5 April, than on 6th it had to reach Bag. The attack on the Austrian forces had to occur on 7 April at Gödöllő, from two directions, while the I. corps would advance to Kerepes, and fell on the Austrians from behind, preventing them to retreat towards Pest. The key of this very risky plan was that the Austrians would not discover the Hungarian movements until they completed the encirclement. This is why on the shoulder of the Hungarian commander of the VIIth Corps, András Gáspár, lied <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>big</b> responsibility to lead his troops in a way which will not betray the campaigns strategy. This meant that he had to make the enemy commander who faced him, to think that he is face to face with the whole Hungarian army, distracting his attention about the I., II., and III. Hungarian corps, which in the meanwhile, were advancing towards Gödöllő from South-East. If Gáspár would have failed this task, Windsich-Grätz could been sent huge troops to destroy him, which would have been open before them the way to the interim Hungarian capital, Debrecen.|$|E

50|$|After {{he married}} Cornelia Boschman in 1658, {{the number of}} works {{produced}} by him declined almost to nothing.

Schur said: [...] "The 'no dating' thing is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>big</b> deal in government – these people are handling taxpayer money, so relationships are even more frowned upon than they are in the private sector." ...|$|E
