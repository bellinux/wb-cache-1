5|$|The nuthatches {{constitute}} a genus, Sitta, of small passerine birds {{belonging to the}} family Sittidae.

He went on to feature in qualifying games for the 1966 FIFA World Cup, but defeats to Poland and Italy left Scotland second in the Group, which {{was not enough to}} qualify. He also played in friendlies against Brazil and Portugal, and received <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>eye</b> from Pelé's elbow in a clash during a high ball; despite this being an accident it still demonstrated to Bremner how he had failed to intimidate Pelé as he had done to many other great players of the day.|$|E

5|$|In a December 22, 1990, {{win against}} in-state rival Western Kentucky, Farmer posted {{a new career}} high with 22 points, despite missing his first five three-point {{attempts}} of the game.

Farmer suffered <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>eye</b> during the game, which was notable for its physicality. Messenger-Inquirer sportswriter Jake Jennings also noted that Farmer relied on drives to the basket to score, as opposed to his usual penchant for shooting three-point shots.|$|E

50|$|Becirrillo's {{date and}} place of birth are unknown {{although}} historians speculate {{he may have been}} whelped in either the kennels of Diego Columbus or those of Juan Ponce de León. <b>A</b> <b>black</b> <b>eyed,</b> medium sized dog with a red coloured coat, it is recorded that he was in Puerto Rico in 1511 already sporting battle scars.

5|$|Waters {{includes}} a historical {{reference to the}} medical profession starting to acknowledge and identify female homosexuality in the 19th century when a friend of Diana's named Dickie reads aloud during a party from a medical text describing the histories of several acknowledged lesbians, including Dickie's own. One story discussed among the wealthy women at the party is about {{a young woman with}} a large clitoris, which they consider congenital in lower-class women. They attempt to prove their point with Diana's maid Zena, but Nan prevents this humiliation, which precipitates her final rift with Diana. Using Dickie's book to strike Nan across the face, Diana gives her <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>eye</b> and bloody cheek before throwing her out into the street with Zena. Nan goes to Florence's house, which is filled with socialist literature. Although Diana is a supporter of women's suffrage, she discourages Nan from reading such literature, confiscating any political material Nan picks up. In contrast, Nan feels hopelessly uninformed when Florence and her friends engage in heated political debates. She asks questions, but feels stupid about not knowing the answers. Florence introduces her to the writings of Walt Whitman, Eleanor Marx, and Edward Carpenter, which they sexualise by using as an introduction to intimacy.|$|E

Money Inc. attacked Beefcake and removed his facemask, but Beefcake fought back and applied a sleeper hold to Schyster. The referee was accidentally knocked unconscious, and Hogan recovered and attacked both members of Money Inc. with Beefcake's facemask. He tried to make the cover for a pinfall, but the referee still unconscious. Manager Jimmy Hart turned his jacket inside-out to reveal a striped referee jacket; he made the three-count and declared The Mega-Maniacs the winners of the match.
