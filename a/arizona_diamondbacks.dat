5|$|His {{first major}} league hit was {{a home run}} off <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks</b> pitcher Russ Ortiz in a 12–11 loss on June 10, 2005; however, he also allowed 15 hits in that game, which tied a club record. Grienke led the 2005 year with losses in the American League, with a 5-17 record and a 5.80 ERA in 33 starts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} 25 years after Hershiser {{recorded}} his streak, the closest challenge came from Brandon Webb of the 2007 <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks,</b> who pitched 42 consecutive scoreless innings.

5|$|After the 2009 season, the Tigers began {{shopping}} Granderson {{to other}} franchises {{in an effort}} to reduce their payroll. The Yankees acquired Granderson in a three-team trade on December 9. In the deal, the Yankees received Granderson while sending Phil Coke and centerfielder Austin Jackson to Detroit. Also, the <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks</b> received Yankees pitcher Ian Kennedy and Tigers pitcher Edwin Jackson in return for young pitchers Max Scherzer and Daniel Schlereth, who joined the Tigers.|$|E
5|$|Bonds did not homer {{again until}} April 13, {{when he hit}} two (736 and 737) in a 3 for 3 night that {{included}} 4 RBI against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Bonds splashed a pitch by St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Ryan Franklin into McCovey Cove on April 18 for home run 738. Home runs number 739 and 740 came in back to back games on April 21 and 22 against the <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks.</b>|$|E
5|$|During spring {{training}} with the Nationals, Doug developed a strained lat muscle {{on his right}} side that {{put him on the}} disabled list to start the 2014 season. He returned on May 9 against the Oakland Athletics where he gave up 5 earned runs on 9 hits in 4.1 innings. He bounced back in his next start, against the <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks,</b> Fister gave up just 1 earned run on 5 hits in 7 innings.|$|E
5|$|On March 8 the Phillies {{made their}} first minor-league demotions: seven players, {{including}} two (Michael Stutes and Luis García) with major-league experience, and top pitching prospect Jesse Biddle. On March 17 Sandberg confirmed speculation that Cliff Lee {{would be the}} Phillies' opening-day starting pitcher against his former team, the Texas Rangers and Yu Darvish, and Rule 5 draft selection Kevin Munson was returned to the <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Phillies did {{not achieve}} their first three-game series sweep until almost {{the end of}} May, taking two from the San Francisco Giants, the <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks</b> (splitting the series 22), the Atlanta Braves, and the Nationals, and {{dropping}} two to the Giants, the Toronto Blue Jays, and the Astros. However, the Phillies' first sweep was achieved in dramatic fashion, as the offense broke out for 60runs in fivegames, including a 205 win over the Colorado Rockies.|$|E
5|$|Weber played collegiately for Los Angeles Harbor College and Texas Tech University before {{embarking on}} his {{professional}} career in 1999. As a professional, {{he played in}} the minor league organizations of the Cincinnati Reds, Oakland Athletics, Los Angeles Dodgers, <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks,</b> Tampa Bay Rays, New York Yankees, and Detroit Tigers. He has also played independent league baseball in the unaffiliated Frontier League, Northern League, and American Association of Independent Professional Baseball. Weber has competed for the United States national baseball team, winning the gold medal at the 2009 Baseball World Cup.|$|E
5|$|When the Los Angeles Dodgers and <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks</b> met in Major League Baseball's season opening {{series at}} the Sydney Cricket Ground in Sydney on 22 and 23 March 2014, Chappell, who had {{represented}} South Australia as a {{catcher in the}} Claxton Shield before embarking on his successful cricket career, was a commentator for the broadcasts, carried on Australia's Channel Nine and in the United States by MLB Network. He worked with Matt Vasgersian and former Cy Young Award winner John Smoltz.|$|E
5|$|Before {{he could}} appear in any games with Colorado Springs, López was claimed off waivers by the <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks</b> on April 14. Due to major league rules, Arizona {{was unable to}} call him up until April 24. He had another poor season, having a record of 1–1 and an 11.02 ERA, {{the highest in the}} majors among {{relievers}} who made at least 30 appearances. On July 5, López was designated for assignment to make room on the roster for Armando Almanza. He cleared waivers and was sent down to the Tucson Sidewinders of the Pacific Coast League {{for the rest of the}} season. He went 0–1 with a 2.22 ERA. On October 15, he was granted free agency.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 season saw heavy {{competition}} between the Padres and the <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks</b> for the National League West divisional title. The Padres spent 52 days {{with at least a}} share of the lead, while the Diamondbacks spent 89 total days atop the division and ultimately won by a game with a record of 90–72. The Rockies spent just three days, last on April 6, with a lead in the division. Notably the Diamondbacks scored 20 fewer runs than their pitchers allowed, one of just five teams in MLB history to make the playoffs despite being outscored during the season.|$|E
5|$|The award's only tie {{occurred}} in the National League in 1979, when Keith Hernandez and Willie Stargell received {{an equal number of}} points. There have been 18 unanimous winners, who received all the first-place votes. The New York Yankees have the most winning players with 22, followed by the St. Louis Cardinals with 17winners. The award has never been presented to a member of the following four teams: <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks,</b> Miami Marlins, New York Mets, and Tampa Bay Rays. The most recent recipients are Mike Trout in the American League and Kris Bryant in the National League.|$|E
5|$|The city {{is home to}} the South Bend Cubs, a Class A Minor League Baseball team, {{which plays}} at Four Winds Field at Coveleski Stadium in {{downtown}} South Bend. In 2014, the franchise changed its name and logo to the South Bend Cubs and became affiliated with the Chicago Cubs; prior to this, it had been known as the South Bend Silver Hawks and affiliated with the <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks.</b> In 2005, the franchise nearly moved to Marion, Illinois, but a group of investors, led by former Indiana Governor and South Bend Mayor Joe Kernan, bought the Silver Hawks in order to ensure the team stayed in South Bend.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{necessary}} after both teams finished {{the season with}} identical win–loss records of 89–73. The Rockies won a coin flip late in the season, which awarded them home field for the game. Upon winning, the Rockies advanced to the NL Division Series where they swept the Philadelphia Phillies. After advancing, they swept the <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks</b> in the NL Championship Series, winning their first pennant in franchise history. However, the Rockies were, in turn, swept in the 2007 World Series by the Boston Red Sox, ending their season. In baseball statistics the tie-breaker counted as the 163rd regular season game for both teams, with all events in the game added to regular season statistics.|$|E
5|$|With the win, Schilling became {{only the}} fifth pitcher to ever win a World Series {{game with a}} team from both leagues, having {{previously}} done it with National League teams, the Philadelphia Phillies in 1993, and the <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks</b> in 2001. He later donated the bloody sock he wore during the game to the Baseball Hall of Fame museum. Much {{of the blame for}} the Cardinals' losses {{in the first two games}} was directed at the fact that Rolen, Edmonds and Reggie Sanders, three of the Cardinals' best batters, had combined for one hit in 22at-bats.|$|E
5|$|With {{two outs}} in the 9th inning {{of a game}} against the <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks</b> on May 28, 1998, Bonds became only the fifth player in {{baseball}} history to be given an intentional walk with the bases loaded. Nap Lajoie (1901), Del Bissonette (1928) and Bill Nicholson (1944) were three others in the 20th century who received that rare honor. The first to receive one was Abner Dalrymple in 1881. During {{a game against the}} Philadelphia Phillies on August 2, Bonds was hit by a pitch thrown by Ricky Bottalico, leading to Bonds charging the mound and triggering a bench-clearing brawl.|$|E
5|$|Several Phillies hold National League {{and major}} league records. Pitcher/outfielder John Coleman {{is the most}} {{decorated}} in this category, holding three major league records, all from the franchise's inaugural season. Coleman set records for losses, earned runs allowed, and hits allowed, all in 1883 when he also set three additional franchise pitching records. Shortstop Jimmy Rollins broke Willie Wilson's record for at-bats in a single season with 716 in 2007, and first baseman Ryan Howard also set the major league record for strikeouts in a single season that same year with 199, before it was broken by Mark Reynolds of the <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks</b> the following year. The 1930 Phillies, who went 52–102, set two more National League records, allowing 1,993 hits and 1,193 runs in the regular season.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks</b> are a Major League Baseball (MLB) {{franchise}} {{based in}} Phoenix, Arizona. They {{play in the}} National League West division. The {{first game of the}} new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day. The Diamondbacks have used seven different Opening Day starting pitchers in their 17seasons. The sevenstarters have a combined Opening Day record of sevenwins, fivelosses (75), and fiveno decisions. No decisions are only awarded to the starting pitcher if the game is won or lost after the starting pitcher has left the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{necessary}} after both teams finished {{the season with}} identical win–loss records of 96–66. Some described the Mets as collapsing {{late in the season}} while the race between the Reds and their division rival Houston Astros was close enough to create the possibility of a three-way tie. The Reds won a coin flip late in the season which, by rule at the time, awarded them home field for the game. Upon winning, the Mets advanced to NL Division Series (NLDS) where they defeated the <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks,</b> three-games-to-one. They then advanced to the NL Championship Series (NLCS) but were defeated by the Atlanta Braves in six games, bringing an end to the Mets' season. In baseball statistics, the tie-breaker counted as the 163rd regular-season game by both teams, with all events in the game added to regular-season statistics.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opener}} of the 2017 NLDS against the <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks,</b> he allowed four solo {{home runs in}} 6 innings but still picked up the win. The four home runs were tied for the most allowed in a postseason game. He made two starts in the 2017 NLCS against the Chicago Cubs, both Dodgers wins, {{including}} the clinching game five. He allowed three runs in 11 innings in the two games with nine strikeouts and only two walks. Kershaw started the opening game of the 2017 World Series for the Dodgers against the Houston Astros. He struckout 11 batters in the game without walking anyone and only allowed one run (a solo homer) on three hits {{to pick up the}} win. His 11 strikeouts were the third most ever by a Dodgers pitcher in a World Series game, after Sandy Koufax (15 in 1963) and Carl Erskine (14 in 1953).|$|E
5|$|López {{attended}} the University of Virginia, earning {{a degree in}} psychology despite leaving early to begin his baseball career. He was selected by the <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks</b> in the fourth round of the 1998 Major League Baseball draft. He {{began his career as}} a starting pitcher but struggled, and was converted into a sidearm (or submarine) reliever while still in the Diamondbacks' organization. Before the 2003 season, he was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the Rule 5 draft, but was traded to the Colorado Rockies during spring training. He spent all of 2003 on Colorado's roster, nearly tying the franchise record for most consecutive batters retired and finishing third among major league rookies in games pitched. He struggled the next two seasons, getting claimed off waivers and later sent to the minors by Arizona in 2005. In 2006, he signed with the Chicago White Sox but failed to make the team and spent the first part of the season in the minors before getting traded to Boston during the year.|$|E
5|$|Major League Baseball {{recognizes the}} player or players in each league {{with the most}} strikeouts each season. Jim Devlin led the National League in its inaugural season of 1876; he threw 122 strikeouts for the Louisville Grays. The American League's first winner was Hall of Fame pitcher Cy Young, who {{captured}} the American League Triple Crown in 1901 by striking out 158 batters, along with leading the league in wins and earned run average. Walter Johnson led the American League in strikeouts 12 times during his Hall of Fame career, most among all players. He is followed by Nolan Ryan, who captured 11 titles between both leagues (9 American League and 2 National League). Randy Johnson won nine strikeout titles, including five with his home state <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks.</b> Three players have won seven strikeout championships: Dazzy Vance, who leads the National League; Bob Feller; and Lefty Grove. Grover Cleveland Alexander and Rube Waddell led their league six times, and five-time winners include Steve Carlton, Roger Clemens, Sam McDowell, Christy Mathewson, Amos Rusie, and Tom Seaver.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 2015, the Braves traded Miller and Gabe Speier to the <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks</b> in {{exchange}} for Dansby Swanson, Ender Inciarte, and Aaron Blair. Following the trade, Miller agreed to a contract worth $4.35 million. Before the 2016 season began, Miller was projected to follow ace Zack Greinke in the rotation. He struggled once the season began, and {{was placed on the}} disabled list on May 24 due to a sprained index finger, making his return on June 20. Miller pitched to a 2–9 record and a 7.14 ERA through the MLB All-Star break, when the Diamondbacks optioned him to the Reno Aces of the PCL. Miller was recalled to start against the San Francisco Giants on August 31. He pitched five innings, yielding two runs on six hits. Miller finished the season with a 3-12 record and a 6.15 ERA, pitching 101 innings in 20 starts.|$|E
5|$|Free agent pitcher Mike Mussina {{signed with}} the Yankees before their 2001 season began, and the club {{pulled away from the}} Red Sox as the year progressed to claim another divisional championship, as Clemens won 20 games. The September 11 attacks {{interrupted}} the season, and the resumption of baseball in New York became a symbol of how the city recovered from the destruction of the Twin Towers. After falling behind 2–0 in the ALDS against the Athletics, the Yankees won three straight contests to advance to the ALCS. They prevailed in five games against the Seattle Mariners, who had tied a single-season MLB record with 116 regular season wins, for the team's fourth straight AL pennant. The <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks</b> gained a two-game lead in the 2001 World Series before the Yankees won three consecutive ballgames; New York home runs with two outs in the ninth inning of Games 4 and 5 led to extra inning wins in both games, with Game 4 ended by a Jeter home run. The Yankees' championship streak ended, though, as the Diamondbacks won the Series in seven games with a late rally in the final inning of Game 7.|$|E
5|$|On November 4, {{following}} the World Series, the Phillies released third base coach Steve Smith. Smith {{had been with}} the team for two years. The Phillies were expected to have the remaining coaches to return for the 2009 season. However, bench coach Jimy Williams opted not to return to the Phillies for the 2009 season, notifying the team on November 10. Charlie Manuel had expected Williams to return for the 2009 season, and was surprised that he declined. However, Williams left the team on good terms, and Manuel stated that he was welcome {{to come back to the}} Phillies if he changed his mind. Left fielder Pat Burrell became a free agent at the end of the 2008 season, signing with the Tampa Bay Rays, whom the Phillies had defeated in the World Series, on January 5. The team did not tender an offer to Burrell following eight seasons. The Phillies also released outfielder So Taguchi on November 5. Taguchi had served as a pinch-hitter for the Phillies in 2008, and also replaced Burrell in left field some games. Eric Bruntlett replaced Taguchi for the latter half of the 2008 season. Relief pitcher Tom Gordon also filed for free agency, ultimately signing with the <b>Arizona</b> <b>Diamondbacks.</b>|$|E
