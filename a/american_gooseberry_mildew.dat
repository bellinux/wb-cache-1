50|$|Whereas R. uva-crispa crops {{have been}} devastated by <b>American</b> <b>gooseberry</b> <b>mildew,</b> Podosphaera mors-uvae (syn: Sphaerotheca mors-uvae), which was accidentally {{introduced}} to Europe, R. hirtellum is resistant. It {{is one of}} four American species that have been interbred with R. uva-crispa to produce resistant cultivars similar to the original R. uva-crispa cultivars.

50|$|The plant itself {{grows to}} a maximum height of about 2 m, {{flowering}} in mid-spring, with fruit setting and ripening on a similar timetable to the blackcurrant.

In particular the plant is resistant to <b>American</b> <b>gooseberry</b> <b>mildew,</b> blackcurrant leaf spot, white pine blister rust, and big bud gall mite. Flowers are hermaphrodite and the plant is self-fertile following insect pollination. Propagation is usually by cuttings, rather than by seeds.|$|E

50|$|Eriksson primary {{research}} {{interest was}} in diseases of crops with primary focus on mildew and parasitic fungus. The most significant finding {{of his research}} work was to describe the special forms within morphologically similar species of rust fungi. His conclusion was rust fungi are specialized and they are biologically different although they exhibit similarity in morphology. Studies of fungal plant pathogen at cellular level by Eriksson provided the {{better understanding of the}} infection process and also contributed to the plant breeding programs. Besides working on rust, Eriksson also studied a lot of other pathogens including clover rot, potato disease and fungus, fruit scab and mold, felt sick on carrot, floral and branch disease in fruit trees, spinach <b>mildew</b> and <b>gooseberry</b> <b>mildew.</b> Eriksson is considered to be first in writing the growers manual on fungal diseases. Eriksson published several books and monographs during his academic career. He also travelled to different countries in Europe. He participated in several international conferences {{as a representative of the}} Swedish government. The credit for establishment of plant physiological laboratory in Erescati near Stockholm goes to him.|$|R
40|$|Warren, J. and James, P. (2006). The {{ecological}} {{effects of}} exotic disease resistance genes introgressed into British gooseberries. Oecologia 147 (1), 69 - 75. RAE 2008 The potential for gene flow between crops and their wild relatives is now well established. However, {{few studies have}} investigated the effects of crop genes on fitness in natural populations, or the indirect ecological consequences of their naturalisation. This study investigates the likelihood of genes derived from North American gooseberry species (which are resistant to the coevolved <b>American</b> <b>gooseberry</b> <b>mildew)</b> becoming established in mildew-susceptible native British gooseberries, {{and the impact of}} this on their invertebrate herbivores. The results reveal that seedlings containing resistance genes had significantly higher survival rates than susceptible native plants. Alien genes were more likely to establish when introgressed into native genomes and when crossed with local provenance genotypes. Furthermore, plants containing alien genes tended to support significantly more but smaller invertebrates. Thus, the potential ecological effects of crop gene escape may vary with source and recipient genome and such effects may not be directly related to the gene?s function. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|With the {{objective}} {{to identify the}} effect of soil cultivation and nitrogen supply in organic production of black currant a field trial was planted autumn 1996 under Unsprayed conditions. The bush rows were cleaned mechanically for weed, and cover crops were established in the alleyways. During establishment all four cover crops gave a sufficient nitrogen supply. The level of nitrogen in soil and the growth were smallest in the annual sown cover crop. Minirhitzotrons were used to follow black currant root growth in total mechanical cleaned plots and plots with sown alleyways. The maximum root dept of black currants of 125 cm were obtained direct under the bush in autumn 1998, whereas the roots only were present down to 40 cm 1. 5 meters from {{the centre of the}} row. The variety 'Titania' had a deeper root pattern than 'Ben Lomond'. There were no significant yield differences among the soil treatments. There was a tendency to a higher yield for 'Titania' in 2000 in the annual sown cover crop, probably due to the deeper root pattern of 'Titania' and thereby less susceptibility to mechanical root damage. 'Titania' had the highest yield in the two cropping years 1999 and 2000, whereas 'Ben Lomond' had a very low yield due to severe infections of <b>American</b> <b>gooseberry</b> <b>mildew</b> (Sphaerotheca Illors-uvae), which caused very little shoot growth. ' Farleigh ' was susceptible to white pine blister rust (Cronartiunl ribicola) and infections of leaf spot (Gloeosporidie//a ribis) occurred every year. 'Titania' and 'Intercontinental' had the best field resistance to diseases...|$|E
50|$|Although usually placed as a {{subgenus}} within Ribes, a few taxonomists treat Grossularia as {{a separate}} genus, although hybrids between gooseberry and blackcurrant (e.g., the jostaberry) are possible. The subgenus Grossularia differs somewhat from currants, chiefly in their spiny stems, and in that their flowers grow one to three together on short stems, not in racemes. It {{is one of several}} similar species in the subgenus Grossularia; for the other related species (e.g., North <b>American</b> <b>Gooseberry</b> Ribes hirtellum), see the genus page Ribes.|$|R

In California they are fairly productive in the coolest parts of the San Francisco Bay Area, the outer Coast Ranges and coastal northern California. They are probably not worth trying in southern California except at high elevations. With proper attention gooseberries can be grown in containers. " [...] unknown author...|$|R
40|$|Woodstock. The federal {{government}} {{and many of the}} surrounding states have dropped their prohibition against growing gooseberries and currants because the real cause has been determined to be the black currant. There is some movement to have these regulations rescinded in New York. Description: Gooseberries are deciduous shrubs, fast growing under optimum conditions to 3 feet tall and 6 feet wide. American types have weeping stems that will root wherever they touch the ground and can be invasive. Annual growth is in a single flush in the spring. The roots are superficial, fine and easily damaged by frequent cultivation. The buds perk up early in the spring, dotting the stems with green when most other plants are still tawny. The leaves are alternate, single, deeply lobed, and glossy dark green (European types), or pale to gray-green and sometimes finely pubescent (American types). The stems are thin, becoming woody, with a large thorn at each axil. <b>American</b> <b>gooseberry</b> stems are densely bristly, with one or more additional The Crop Profile/PMSP database, including this document, is supported by USDA NIFA...|$|R
