5|$|New Orleans mayor Marc Morial {{stated that}} he had {{approached}} Heisley {{in an attempt to}} attract the Grizzlies to his city. The city had opened the US$114million New Orleans Arena (now Smoothie King Center) in 1999, and offered it as a home to the franchise. Metrovision, the area's economic development chamber, stated that they had secured guarantees for purchasing suites, season tickets and club seating from businesses to the extent that there was <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> for suites. Also a relocation to St. Louis, under the same conditions as with Laurie, was considered.|$|E
5|$|Although {{tickets for}} the Masters are not expensive, they are very {{difficult}} to come by. Even the practice rounds can be difficult to get into. Applications for practice round tickets have to be made nearly a year in advance and the successful applicants are chosen by random ballot. Tickets to the actual tournament are sold only to members of a patrons list, which is closed. <b>A</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> for the patrons list was opened in 1972 and closed in 1978. It was reopened in 2000 and subsequently closed once again. In 2008, the Masters also began allowing children (between the ages of 8 and 16) to enter on tournament days free if they are accompanied by the patron who is the owner of his or her badge.|$|E
5|$|More than 99percent of Benet {{graduates}} go to college; roughly 1percent {{serve in}} the military. Benet students were implicated in the University of Illinois clout scandal, in which some applicants were given preferential admission to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) despite having sub-par qualifications. The Chicago Tribune, investigating the scandal, reported {{that a majority of}} students who were admitted to UIUC through political favors came from elite, affluent high schools such as Benet, where families were politically connected with elected officials and university trustees. An email between admissions officers revealed that a female Benet student was admitted to the university's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, {{despite the fact that she}} had ranked lower than 27 of her classmates who were put on <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> or denied admission. Between 2005 and 2009, thirteen applicants from Benet were alleged to have had political connections; eight of them were admitted to UIUC.|$|E

5|$|Between 1986 and 1996, River Oaks Elementary School only {{admitted}} {{magnet school}} students {{from other areas}} of the city. The community was divided between the attendance zones of Wilson Elementary School (opened in 1925), the now closed Will Rogers Elementary School (opened in 1950, closed in summer 2006), and Poe Elementary School. By 1995 River Oaks Elementary {{became one of the most}} prestigious elementary schools in Houston and had <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>list.</b> By that year several new families had established themselves in River Oaks and many of them were interested in sending their children to public school. In 1995, several River Oaks parents petitioned HISD to re-establish the neighborhood program at River Oaks Elementary School which allows non-magnet students residing in the school's boundaries to attend. Some magnet parents opposed, believing that the River Oaks program would reduce racial diversity at the school. In 1996, HISD added a neighborhood program to the school for grades Kindergarten through 2nd, with grades 3 through 5 phased in over a subsequent three-year period.|$|E

25|$|If a seat is not available, {{then the}} ticket is given <b>a</b> <b>wait</b> <b>listed</b> number; else the ticket is confirmed, and a berth number is {{printed on the}} ticket. A person {{receiving}} <b>a</b> <b>wait</b> <b>listed</b> ticket must <b>wait</b> until there are enough cancellations to enable him {{to move up the}} list and obtain a confirmed ticket. If his ticket is not confirmed on the day of departure, he may not board the train. Some of the tickets are assigned to the RAC or Reservation against Cancellation, which is between the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> and the confirmed list. These allow the ticket holder to board the train and obtain an allotted seat decided by a ticket collector, after the ticket collector has ascertained that there is a vacant (absentee) seat.|$|R
50|$|Access {{to public}} housing in Victoria can be {{difficult}} as many prospective residents must <b>wait</b> on <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> until rooms and apartments become available.

During that 9-month period he walked with a limp and reportedly was on strong painkillers; he had to cancel several official trips due to the pain he was in.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} before his death, DeLorean planned to resurrect his car company, and gave {{interviews}} describing a new vehicle called the DMC2. According to his family, {{he spent much of}} his last several years working on this new venture. In an effort to gather funds, he designed and sold high-end watches via the internet under the name DeLorean Time.

Priority is given to students of administration, faculty, current enrolled siblings, and residents of Academy School District 20.|$|R
5000|$|According {{to several}} reports, colleges and {{universities}} use <b>wait</b> <b>lists</b> to try to hedge their guesses about how many students will ultimately decide to accept their offers of admission in any given academic year, with the idea being to build [...] "a reservoir of qualified students to draw from to replace successful applicants who choose to go elsewhere." [...] If fewer students say yes, then colleges will often go to their <b>wait</b> <b>lists</b> {{to try to find}} replacements. In 2010, according to one source, roughly 10% of college applicants were put on <b>a</b> <b>wait</b> <b>list.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Wait</b> <b>lists</b> {{tend to be}} used by {{elite and}} {{selective}} universities as well as second-tier liberal arts colleges who are uncertain about how many students will show up in the fall; for example, Stanford and Yale put 1,000 students on their <b>wait</b> <b>lists</b> and Duke put 3,000 on their <b>wait</b> <b>list,</b> according to one report in 2010. Amherst takes 35 students from the 1,000 students on its <b>wait</b> <b>list.</b> And as <b>a</b> general rule, selective colleges and universities will usually have some form of <b>wait</b> <b>list.</b> Of the students on <b>a</b> <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> at <b>a</b> highly selective school, a fraction may be offered admission before classes begin in late August or September. One report said the fraction of wait-listed students who were eventually offered admission - [...] - as an average of all students <b>wait</b> <b>listed</b> in <b>a</b> given year - [...] - was 30%, but this is an overall average, and the fraction of wait-listed applicants to prestigious universities, who are eventually admitted, is much less. Students who are wait-listed can take steps to improve their chances of admission from <b>a</b> <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> by writing letters of interest and by sending second-semester senior grades. <b>Wait</b> <b>listed</b> students are ranked by the admissions department in terms of overall desirability, based on the college's estimation of admissions criteria, and more highly ranked waitlisted students are offered admission first when spots open; this ranking is not revealed to the public.|$|R
25|$|One {{issue with}} trials is what {{to use as}} a placebo {{treatment}} group or non-treatment control group. Often this is patients on <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>list,</b> or people receiving some kind of regular non-specific contact or support. One issue {{is the best way to}} match the use of inert tablets or sham treatments in placebo-controlled studies in pharmaceutical trials. Several interpretations and differing assumptions and language remain. Another issue is the attempt to standardize and manualize therapies and link them to specific symptoms of diagnostic categories, making them more amenable to research. Some report that this may reduce efficacy or gloss over individual needs. Finagy and Roth's opinion is that the benefits of the evidence-based approach outweighs the difficulties.|$|E
25|$|Tarek ibn Ziyad Academy (TIZA) was an {{elementary}} school (K-8) in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota named after Tarek ibn Ziyad, the Berber general of medieval Algeria who entered Gibraltar in 711 CE {{on behalf of the}} Umayyad Caliphate and defeated the Visigoths. The school is sponsored by Islamic Relief USA. The school has a primarily Muslim student body and has been embroiled in a number of controversies regarding {{the separation of church and}} state. The school has <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> of 1,500 students. Around 80% of students are English language learners. Despite this, the school has one of the highest reading scores on standardized tests in the state. As of July 2011 TiZA has been shut down by order of the Minnesota Education Department, due to lack of an approved charter school sponsor.|$|E
