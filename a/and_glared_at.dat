500|$|Barrett did not {{contribute}} material to the band after A Saucerful of Secrets was released in 1968. Of the songs he wrote for Pink Floyd after The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, only one, [...] "Jugband Blues", {{made it to the}} band's second album; one, [...] "Apples and Oranges", became a less-than-successful single; and two others, [...] "Scream Thy Last Scream" [...] and [...] "Vegetable Man", were never officially released until 2016 in The Early Years 1965–1972 box set, as they were deemed too dark and unsettling. Feeling guilty for ousting their friend, the members of Pink Floyd were unable to bring themselves to definitively tell Barrett that he was no longer in the band. According to Rick Wright, who lived with Barrett at the time, Wright had the awful job of telling Barrett that he was going out to buy cigarettes while he went off to play a gig. He would return hours later to find Barrett in the same position, sometimes with a cigarette burned completely down between his fingers (an incident later referenced in Pink Floyd's The Wall). Emerging from catatonia and unaware that {{a long period of time}} had elapsed, Barrett would ask, [...] "Have you got the cigarettes?". Barrett supposedly spent time outside the recording studio, in the reception area, waiting to be invited in. He also showed up to a few gigs <b>and</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> Gilmour. Barrett played slide guitar on [...] "Remember a Day" [...] (which had been first attempted during the Piper sessions), and also played on [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun". On 6 April 1968, the group officially announced Barrett was no longer a member, the same day the band's contract with Blackhill Enterprises was terminated as the record label. Considering Barrett to be the musical brains of the band, Blackhill Enterprises retained Barrett.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} August 1937, the Japanese {{military}} restricted foreigners from {{crossing the}} Garden Bridge: [...] "There is much local criticism of the Japanese naval authorities who, still persist in their refusals to permit foreigners to cross the Garden Bridge." [...] After August 1937 the Waibaidu Bridge was the de facto border between the International Settlement and Japanese occupied Hongkew (now Hongkou) and Zhabei. As Mark Gayn recalls: [...] "The creek became the boundary between two worlds. To the north was the world of fear, death, and the Japanese bayonet. To the south, law was still supreme and life remained as normal {{as it could be}} with bombs exploding....Of all the bridges, the Garden Bridge alone remained open to traffic, and on its narrow roadway the two hostile worlds met <b>and</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> each other." [...] The west end of Garden Bridge, was guarded by members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. Harold Rattenbury recalls: [...] "Japanese and Scottish sentries face one another on the Garden Bridge. To the Japanese all Chinese must remove their hats; so I took pleasure in removing mine to our Scottish sentries also." [...] Kemp Tolley indicates: [...] "A Japanese sentry stood on the Garden Bridge, over odoriferous Soochow Creek, which separated Honkew {{from the rest of the}} International Settlement. Foreigners were expected, on pain of a possible slap in the face, to bow gently from the waist when passing the sentry. Chinese coolies grunted, groaned and yei-hoed, pushing heavily loaded carts up the bridge's steep approaches. An occasional bayonet thrust into a bale or a prick in some tender part of a coolie's anatomy reminded everyone who was boss. Although Honkew was a part of the International Settlement, the Settlement taxis and rickshaws were not allowed there. One had to hire a ramshackle vehicle especially licensed — or walk across the bridge, bowing en route, and pick up a conveyance in Japanese [...] "territory." ...|$|E
