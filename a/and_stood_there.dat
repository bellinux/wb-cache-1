5|$|The {{first song}} {{came on and}} I just stood up and I kind of walked {{into the other room}} as if I was in a tractor beam <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> in front of the stereo.

2500|$|At dawn, Zhang Liao donned his armour, {{carried a}} ji, and led {{his men to}} attack the enemy formation. He killed tens of enemy {{soldiers}} and two officers, shouted his own name, and broke through the barriers until he reached Sun Quan's command post. Sun Quan was shocked and his subordinates were all unsure of what to do. He {{then went to the}} top of a knoll, armed himself with a long ji, <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there.</b> He did not dare to move when Zhang Liao challenged him to come down and fight him. When Sun Quan saw that Zhang Liao did not have many soldiers left with him, he ordered his forces to surround Zhang and his men. However, Zhang Liao fought fiercely and succeeded in breaking out of the encirclement with a few of his men. His remaining men, who were still trapped by the enemy, shouted, [...] "General, are you abandoning us?" [...] Zhang Liao then turned back and fought his way into the encirclement and succeeded in rescuing his remaining men. Sun Quan and his forces were all stunned by Zhang Liao's valour and did not dare to stand in his way. The skirmish lasted from dawn to the afternoon, and the morale of Sun Quan's army had fallen significantly. Zhang Liao returned to Hefei fortress and strengthened his defences. The defenders felt much more at ease and were very impressed with him.|$|E
