40|$|Objective: To {{address the}} {{inconsistent}} findings on whether childhood misfortune increases adult cancer occurrence. Methods: This study uses longitudinal {{data from the}} National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) that first sampled 3, 032 respondents aged 25 to 74 during 1995 - 1996. A series of logistic regressions were estimated sepa-rately {{for men and women}} to test whether the effect of childhood mis-fortune on adult cancer was largely cumulative or specific to the type or profile of misfortune. Results: For men, additive childhood misfortune, physical <b>abuse</b> <b>by</b> father, and frequent <b>abuse</b> <b>by</b> either parent increased cancer risk. For women, physical <b>abuse</b> <b>by</b> mother and frequent <b>abuse</b> <b>by</b> either parent increased cancer risk. Discussion: Analyses reveal the im-portance of examining alternative specifications of childhood misfortune for men and women. Additive childhood misfortune predicted cancer for men only, whereas child <b>abuse</b> <b>by</b> parent of the same sex predicted cancer for men and women...|$|R

Four people later filed formal complaints with the state prosecutor, but the statute of limitations for the alleged crimes had passed.|$|E

5|$|Springbok colours is {{the name}} given to green and gold blazers awarded {{to members of the}} South Africa {{national}} rugby union team. They were historically awarded to all South African teams and individuals representing the country in international competition following their creation in 1906. With the arrival of South Africa's new post-apartheid government in 1994, the name 'Springbok' was abandoned by the various control boards since they felt that the term had been <b>abused</b> <b>by</b> the previous apartheid governments, and stigmatised by the anti-apartheid movement. An exception was made {{in the case of the}} national rugby union team where they have retained the practice of awarding colours.|$|E

5|$|The {{success and}} {{expansion}} of Islam brought it into contact with different cultures, societies and traditions, {{such as those of}} Byzantines and Persians.

Moreover, there was a significant distance between Medina, the Islamic capital, and the Muslims on the periphery on the Islamic state. Thus far off jurists had to find novel Islamic solutions without the close supervision of the hub of Islamic law (back in Medina). During the Umayyad dynasty, the concept of qiyas was <b>abused</b> <b>by</b> the rulers.
