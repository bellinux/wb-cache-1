50|$|The Bloxsom <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> was an {{incubator}} used in {{the treatment}} of respiratory distress among newly born infants in the 1950s. The device was developed by Dr. Allan Bloxsom, a pediatrician at St. Joseph Hospital in Houston, Texas. At its peak, the device was utilized in more than 700 hospitals. The Bloxsom <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> produced unfavorable results in a 1956 clinical trial. By that time physicians had also become leery of the link between high-concentration oxygen and eye disease in premature babies, and the device fell out of favor. The Bloxsom <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> is sometimes cited as an example of technology that gained wide acceptance following inadequate evaluation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{higher the}} {{volatility}} of the fuel, {{the more likely it}} is that vapor lock will occur. Historically, gasoline was a more volatile distillate than it is now and was more prone to vapor lock. Conversely, diesel fuel is far less volatile than gasoline, so that diesel engines almost never suffer from vapor lock. However, diesel engine fuel systems are far more susceptible to <b>air</b> <b>locks</b> in their fuel lines, because standard diesel fuel injection pumps rely on the fuel being non-compressible. <b>Air</b> <b>locks</b> are caused by air leaking into the fuel delivery line or entering from the tank. <b>Air</b> <b>locks</b> are eliminated by turning the engine over for a time using the starter motor, or by bleeding the fuel system.|$|E

50|$|Bloxsom {{developed}} the <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> device {{based on his}} assumptions {{about the role of}} uterine contractions in establishing effective breathing at birth. The <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> was a sealed steel cylinder that delivered warmed and humidified 60% oxygen to newly born babies. The device has been compared to an iron lung, but it did not utilize negative pressure. The pressure inside the chamber alternated between 0.07 and 0.2 atmospheres above sea level. Rather than alternating the pressures at the rate of normal respirations as other devices did, the Bloxsom <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> cycled the pressure once per minute to mimic the rate of uterine contractions in late labor. Babies in distress were placed in the chamber immediately after delivery.|$|R

5000|$|The {{device was}} rolled out in 1950. That year, Bloxsom {{presented}} a {{talk on the}} device at an American Medical Association conference. That led to the <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> being featured in Newsweek, which referred to the device as the [...] "Plexiglass Mother". A Houston company developed a Plexiglass model. In 1952, U.S. Army physicians shared their experience with the device, writing that the <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> was a valuable resuscitation device and that on occasion {{it appeared to be}} lifesaving. Though the apparatus was large and loud, one pediatrician pointed out that the infant was protected from [...] "meddlesome and unintelligent treatment" [...] while locked inside the chamber.

40|$|Introduction: Injection {{is one of}} {{most painful}} and common medical {{interventions}} that more than 12 billion of it are administered annually throughout the world. Pain remains {{as one of the}} unresolved health problems. The objective of this research was to investigate the pain severity utilizing the z-track <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> technique during intra muscular injection procedure. Method:This study was conducted as an unblinded cinical trial, where 90 female subjects aged between 18 - 25 years old were randomly assigned to three groups of 30. Each group received z-track <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> (Group ZTAL), <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> (AL), and z-track (Group ZT) techniques. Neurobion 5000 vitamin used as an injection substance. A Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) on 0 – 3 was used to evaluate the severity of pain during procedure. Data were analized using the SPSS version 19. Groups’ age, Body Mass Index (BMI) and pain severity were analyzed through descriptive and One Way ANOVA statistics. Results: Results showed that there were no signifi cant differences of pain severity both within and between groups (p > 0. 05). Discussion: Both Z-track and <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> method are less pain compared to traditional method according to previous studies. Noncicepti stimulus inhibited nocicepti stimulus in z-track technique while locking effect inhibit leakeage of substance injection to subcutaneous layer of skin which contain of nerve fi bers.

Between 1949 and 1952, this rate had decreased from 63 per 10,000 infants to 37 per 10,000 infants. Bloxsom and Angelique cited the <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> device as a contributor to the improvement in outcomes. However, a 1956 study from Johns Hopkins Hospital failed to show a significant difference in outcomes between infants treated in the Bloxsom <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> versus those cared for in the Isolette brand of incubator.|$|R

50|$|Air lock {{problems}} {{often occur}} {{when one is}} trying to recommission a system {{after it has been}} deliberately (for servicing) or accidentally emptied. For example, a central heating system using a circulating pump to pump water through radiators. When filling such a system, air is trapped in the radiators. This air has to be vented using screw valves built into the radiators. Depending on the pipe layout - if there are any upside down 'U's in the circuit - {{it will be necessary to}} vent the highest point(s). If not, air lock may stop flow through that part of the circuit completely. Note that circulating pumps usually do not generate enough pressure to overcome <b>air</b> <b>locks.</b>|$|E
