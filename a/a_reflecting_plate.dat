In particular, the asymptotic late-time behavior of its z-component,, for the wave-packet case {{is quite different from}} the test point-particle case (z is the coordinate normal to the plate). The result for the wave-packet is ∼ 1 /^ 2 in the late time (is the measuring time), in stead of the reported late-time behavior ∼ 1 /z^ 2 for a point-particle probe.

40|$|We discuss {{different}} {{physical effects}} {{related to the}} uniform acceleration of atoms in vacuum, {{in the framework of}} quantum electrodynamics. We first investigate the van der Waals/Casimir-Polder dispersion and resonance interactions between two uniformly accelerated atoms in vacuum. We show that the atomic acceleration significantly affects the van der Waals force, yielding a different scaling of the interaction with the interatomic distance and an explicit time dependence of the interaction energy. We argue how these results could allow for an indirect detection of the Unruh effect through dispersion interactions between atoms. We then consider the resonance interaction between two accelerated atoms, prepared in a correlated Bell-type state, and interacting with the electromagnetic field in the vacuum state, separating vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction contributions, both in the free-space and in the presence of <b>a</b> perfectly <b>reflecting</b> <b>plate.</b> We show that nonthermal effects of acceleration manifest in the resonance interaction, yielding a change of the distance dependence of the resonance interaction energy. This suggests that the equivalence between temperature and acceleration does not apply to all radiative properties of accelerated atoms. To further explore this aspect, we evaluate the resonance interaction between two atoms in non inertial motion in the coaccelerated (Rindler) frame and show that in this case the assumption of an Unruh temperature for the field is not required for a complete equivalence of locally inertial and coaccelerated points of views.

40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{a rapidly}} emerging technology for high-resolution biomedical imaging. The axial {{resolution of this}} technology {{is determined by the}} bandwidth of the source. Commercial sources generally provide resolutions of 10 – 20 μm whereas laboratory-based solid state lasers have resolutions of ≈ 4 μm. The resolution in tissue depends almost exclusively on detecting single scattered events. However, the phenomenon known as multiple scattering results in a deterioration of resolution as a function of depth. In this study, OCT was combined with ultrasound in an attempt to reduce the effect of multiple scattering. The theory is that, with parallel ultrasound and OCT beams, multiply scattered light with a momentum component significantly perpendicular to the OCT beam will be reduced because the light is Doppler shifted outside the bandpass filter of the OCT detection electronics. A 7. 5 -MHz ultrasound transducer was used to introduce the photon/phonon interaction. <b>A</b> <b>reflecting</b> metal <b>plate</b> was placed within biological tissue, and the point spread function (PSF) was assessed off the reflector.

Combining OCT with a parallel ultrasound beam results in an improvement in resolution through a reduced effect of multiple scattering due to photon/phonon interaction. With higher frequencies, better control of the acoustical beam, and tests in media with higher rates of multiple scattering, improved results are anticipated...|$|R

It is therefore necessary to use techniques of non-destructive testing (NDT) such as ultrasonic Lambwaves. Lamb waves in thin plates are very convenient in detectingcracks in large-scale structures because these waves can propagate long distances and thus, can help us explore large portions of theplate; see, e. g., (Viktorov 1967). In a faultless plate, a Lamb wave can travel long distances with-out dispersion or reflection. Defects reflect and scatter these waves; as a result, the very presence of <b>a</b> <b>reflected</b> wave indicates <b>a</b> defect. It is reasonable to determine the location of the crack by measuring the reflected waves. Reduction to a geometric problem.

To minimize this problem and optimize the de-icing system it is very important to have an efficient ice detection system. Ap-plication of guided wave propagation has been previously considered in aircraft industries. To study this application for wind turbines, guided wave propagation should be investigated in composite materials. In the current work, first the guided wave propagation in multi-layered anisotropic materials is mathematically modelled and dispersion curves were obtained. More-over the composite plate was homogenized to an anisotropic plate in order to simplify the cal-culations. Comparison of dispersion curves shows changes in group velocity when a second layer as ice is added on top of the first layer. Next, a finite element model was made to observe the effects of ice accretion on top of a composite plate. An experimental set-up was also devel-oped at a cold climate lab on a composite test object used in wind turbine industry.
