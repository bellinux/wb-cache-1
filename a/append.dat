The game was submitted to Steam Greenlight by Chinese publisher Hikari Field on September 15, 2016. An <b>append</b> disc for Tayutama 2, featuring {{the characters of}} Tayutama, was released to users who purchased Lump of Sugar's previous titles, Rensō Relation and Kodomo no Asobi.|$|E
5|$|SAS was re-designed in SAS 76 {{with an open}} {{architecture}} that allowed for compilers and procedures. The INPUT and INFILE statements were improved so they could read most data formats used by IBM mainframes. Generating reports was also added through the PUT and FILE statements. The ability to analyze general linear models was also added as was the FORMAT procedure, which allowed developers to customize the appearance of data. In 1979, SAS 79 added support for the CMS operating system and introduced the DATASETS procedure. Three years later, SAS 82 introduced an early macro language and the <b>APPEND</b> procedure.|$|E
5|$|Deir Ghassaneh and Beit Rima were merged {{and granted}} {{municipal}} status in February 1966 during Jordanian rule, partially {{due to the}} efforts of Kassim al-Rimawi, the rural affairs minister at the time and a native of Beit Rima. Its first mayor, Adib Mohammed Rimawi, was appointed by King Hussein. The municipality building is located in Beit Rima. In June 1967 Israel occupied the West Bank after defeating Arab forces in the Six Day War. In 1972 the first municipal polls were held and Fa'eq Ali Rimawi was elected. In 1978 Bani Zeid was one of several Palestinian localities to <b>append</b> its municipal seal to the Memorandum from the masses and the institutions of the West Bank to the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization in a display of unity with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The memorandum was a rejection of any solution, regardless of its origin, not containing a clear recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to establishing an independent Palestinian national state. In 2000 Bani Zeid was incorporated into Area A giving the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), the Palestinian governing body established after the Oslo Agreements with Israel in 1993, full control over security and civilian affairs in the town.|$|E

25|$|On April 30, 2010, {{an updated}} version of Miku called Hatsune Miku <b>Append</b> was {{released}} containing a package of six different tones of Miku's voice: Soft (gentle, delicate voice), Sweet (young, chibi voice), Dark (mature, heartbroken-like voice), Vivid (bright, cheerful voice), Solid (loud, clear voice), and Light (innocent, heavenly voice). Crypton Future Media also released Kagamine Rin/Len <b>Append</b> on December 27, 2010.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, one {{can imagine}} {{directly}} generating the entire infinite Fibonacci word by the following process: start with a cursor pointing to the single digit 0. Then, at each step, if the cursor is pointing to a 0, <b>append</b> 1, 0 {{to the end of}} the word, and if the cursor is pointing to a 1, <b>append</b> 0 {{to the end of the}} word.

That accounts for all but 210 of the octads. Those remaining octads are subsets of W21 and are symmetric differences of pairs of lines. There are many possible ways to expand the group PΓL(3,4) to M24.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{when the}} family name reform was {{introduced}} in the mid-19th century, the default was to use a patronym, or a matronym when the father was dead or unknown. The typical derivation was to <b>append</b> the suffix -escu to the father's name, e.g. Anghelescu ("Anghel's child") and Petrescu ("Petre's child"). (The -escu seems to come from Latin -iscum, thus being cognate with Italian -esco and French -esque.) The other common derivation was to <b>append</b> the suffix -eanu to the name of the place of origin, especially when one came from a different region, e.g. Munteanu ("from the mountains") and Moldoveanu ("from Moldova"). These uniquely Romanian suffixes strongly identify ancestral nationality.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>appending</b> of real numbers, {{and also}} {{conjugate}} pairs, to Newton spectra is studied to understand {{circumstances in which}} the Newton inequalities are preserved. <b>Appending</b> to a non-Newton spectrum to achieve the Newton inequalities is also studied. Finally the translations of Newton spectra that are Newton are also studied. A sample result is that any number of positive real numbers may be <b>appended</b> to a Newton spectrum, to retain the Newton property, when the Newton coefficients are positive, while any Newton spectrum may be made non-Newton by <b>appending</b> a conjugate pair with positive real part and sufficiently large imaginary part...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} bring the collocal {{collinear}} fields from the general into the perspective position, it is required to determine the identical <b>appended</b> series of points. Because of the properties depending on the projectivity that is given by the four <b>appended</b> points (straight lines) the <b>appended</b> identical series of the points and types are ranked among the invariants of general-collinear and perspectively-collinear fields. The procedure of determination of <b>appended</b> identical series of points is comprised of the following: in the set of ∞ 1 of perspectively similar series in one field (whose center of perspective is a point on the vanishing line), find those that are identical to all the series in the set ∞ 1 of perspective identical series of points in the other field (whose center of perspective is the point on the infinitely distant straight line). In the procedure, one begins from the <b>appended</b> similar methods obtained by the general method. The procedure is simplified {{by the introduction of}} the specially given similar series of points. Key words: collocal general-collinear fields, <b>appended</b> identical series of points 1. ...|$|R

The media builds Bickle into a hero, when, had he been a little quicker drawing his gun against Senator Palantine, {{he would have been}} reviled as an assassin. As the film closes, the misanthrope has been embraced as the model citizen—someone who takes on pimps, drug dealers, and mobsters to save one little girl.|$|E
25|$|In Figure 5, both ribosomal {{subunits}} (small and large) assemble at {{the start}} codon (towards the 5' end of the RNA). The ribosome uses RNA that matches the current codon (triplet) on the mRNA to <b>append</b> an amino acid to the polypeptide chain. This is done for each triplet on the RNA, while the ribosome moves towards the 3' end of the mRNA. Usually in bacterial cells, several ribosomes are working parallel on a single RNA, forming {{what is called a}} polyribosome or polysome.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{breakthroughs}} in molecular, cell, evolutionary, and developmental biology generated {{a cornucopia of}} data-based theory relevant to cognition. Categorical assignments were problematic. For example, the decision to <b>append</b> cognitive to a body of biological research on neurons, e.g. the cognitive biology of neuroscience, is separate from the decision to put such body of research in a category named cognitive sciences. No less difficult a decision needs be made—between the computational and constructivist approach to cognition, and the concomitant issue of simulated v. embodied cognitive models—before appending biology to a body of cognitive research, e.g. the cognitive science of artificial life.|$|E

For convenience, the user may <b>append</b> the code generated by the hardware key {{to his or her}} password in the login screen. This way he or she is not prompted for it on another page. This method is required for some services, such as when using PayPal through the eBay application on iPhone.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} the English Vocaloid studios, Power FX's Sweet Ann was given her own MySpace page and Sonika her own Twitter account. In {{comparison}} to Japanese studios, Zero-G and PowerFX maintain {{a high level of}} contact with their fans. Zero-G in particular encourages fan feed back and, after adopting Sonika as a mascot for their studio, has run two competitions related to her. There was also talk from PowerFX of redoing their Sweet Ann box art and a competition would be included as part of the redesign. The Vocaloid Lily also had a competition held during her trial period. English Vocaloids have not sold enough to warrant extras, such as seen with Crypton's Miku <b>Append.</b> However, it has been confirmed if the English Vocaloids become more popular, then Appends would be an option in the future. Crypton plans to start an electronic magazine for English readers at the end of 2010 in order to encourage the growth of the English Vocaloid fanbase. Extracts of PowerFX's Sweet Ann and Big Al were included in Soundation Studio in their Christmas loops and sound release with a competition included.|$|E
