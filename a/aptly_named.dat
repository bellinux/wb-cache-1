5|$|The Flag of His Country is a 1910 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The patriotic film focuses on a man <b>aptly</b> <b>named</b> Walter North who sides with the Union and whilst his wife sides with the Confederacy in the American Civil War. The family is reunited thirty years later at a Grand Army of the Republic reunion through the actions of their grandchild. Little {{is known about the}} production and cast of the film, but the role of granddaughter was played by Marie Eline. Released on July 1, 1910, the film took place within living memory of the war and a reviewer in the The Moving Picture World specifically noted that the film would not offend its audience members. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The eponymous {{protagonist of}} the series is Septimus Heap. As the seventh son of a seventh son, the <b>aptly</b> <b>named</b> Septimus has {{exceptional}} magical powers. He shares his birthday with Jenna, his adoptive sister, but is presumed dead at birth by his family. For most of the first novel he appears as Boy 412, a child from the Young Army, where he has spent the first ten {{years of his life}} after DomDaniel attempted to abduct him. Thereafter he is apprentice to the ExtraOrdinary Wizard Marcia Overstrand. He has a mop of curly hair, wears green apprentice robes and has a Dragon Ring on his right hand. In the second novel, he acquires a dragon called Spit Fyre as a pet. According to a review in the Manila Standard Today, the contrast between the caution he has learned from an early age and his longing for the love and affection of a family makes him an intriguing character.|$|E

Lieutenant Seth Hudson was stationed at Fort Massachusetts in 1759 and discovered what is today known as Hudson Brook around 1760 when he relocated out to the Western Massachusetts/Vermont border.

50|$|The Ishtarians have a {{low level}} of technology, roughly {{comparable}} to the Bronze Age on Earth. Roughly every one thousand years, a red giant in a highly eccentric orbit approaches Ishtar closely enough to cause a rise in temperatures. Subsequently, severe weather changes such as droughts and storms occur for over a century. Civilizations collapse during this time as barbarians flee affected lands to plunder better ones. Ishtarians <b>aptly</b> <b>name</b> this period the Fire Time. This, coupled with their long lifespans, has caused them to be locked into their current level of technology for millennia in spite of being a creative and inventive race with greater mental stability than humans.|$|R
5|$|To remedy this, {{assorted}} {{odds and}} ends were used to reinforce 18th Army. The first of these was the only German cavalry division, <b>aptly</b> <b>named</b> 1st Kavalleriedivision. The mounted troops of this unit, accompanied by some infantry, were to occupy the weakly defended provinces east of the river IJssel {{and then try to}} cross the Afsluitdijk (Enclosure Dike). A simultaneous landing in Holland near Enkhuizen was to be attempted, using barges to be captured in the small port of Stavoren. As both efforts were unlikely to succeed, the mass of regular divisions was reinforced by the SS-Verfügungsdivision (including SS-Standarten Der Führer, Deutschland and Germania) and Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler, which would serve as assault infantry to breach the Dutch fortified positions. Still this added only 1 division to the equation.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} several months, many new punk rock bands formed, often {{directly}} inspired by the Sex Pistols. In London, women were {{near the center of}} the scene—among the initial wave of bands were the female-fronted Siouxsie and the Banshees and X-Ray Spex and the all-female the Slits. There were female bassists Gaye Advert in the Adverts and Shanne Bradley in the Nipple Erectors. Other groups included Subway Sect, Eater, Wire, The Stranglers, the Subversives, the <b>aptly</b> <b>named</b> London, and Chelsea, which soon spun off Generation X. Farther afield, Sham 69 began practicing in the southeastern town of Hersham. In Durham, there was Penetration, with lead singer Pauline Murray. On September 20–21, the 100 Club Punk Festival in London featured the four primary British groups (London's big three and Buzzcocks), as well as Paris's female-fronted Stinky Toys, arguably the first punk rock band from a non-Anglophone country. Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect debuted on the festival's first night; that same evening, Eater debuted in Manchester. On the festival's second night, audience member Sid Vicious was arrested, charged with throwing a glass at the Damned that shattered and destroyed a girl's eye. Press coverage of the incident fueled punk's reputation as a social menace.|$|E
5|$|The British had {{determined}} the Tug Argan gap {{the best possible}} place to make a stand out of the three roadways, and also the most likely invasion route, and thus positioned {{the bulk of the}} army around it. On the British right, to the north of Tug Argan, were three companies of the 3/15 Punjab Regiment, set upon a group of west-facing strongpoints overlooking the rough wilderness that lay beside the road. South of them lay the gap itself, manned by a contingent of Rhodesian troops. They sat upon a line of small hills, named from north to south Black, Knobbly, Mill, Observation, and Castle Hills. These hills, positioned in a row with 2,000–2,500 yard gaps in between, housed machine-gun nests surrounded with light rings of barbed wire and served as the Rhodesians' defensive strongholds and the main defense for the British of the pass. On the British left were another group of Indian troops, located upon the <b>aptly</b> <b>named</b> 'Punjab Ridge' facing directly to the south. Unfortunately for the British, the front was too wide for the troops available, and the gaps between hills too large, leaving the defenses prone to infiltration. Also, due to the hills being in a single line, the position lacked depth. Meanwhile, De Simone, arriving {{at the site of the}} impending battle on 10 August, set his forces directly opposite the British positions. On the left, II Brigade prepared to advance through the wilderness towards the Punjab troops in the north. In the Italian center, XIV Brigade faced the Rhodesian hilltop positions within the pass, and XV Brigade looked north towards Punjab Ridge on the Italian right. Behind them were XIII Brigade and the armored vehicles.|$|E

The silver-leafed wormwood Artemisia absinthium 'Lambrook Silver' is still a popular variety. Other varieties named after her garden include the spurge Euphorbia characias ssp. wulfenii 'Lambrook Gold', the cotton lavender Santolina chamaecyparissus 'Lambrook Silver', and the primrose Primula 'Lambrook Mauve'. She hunted out several rare old double forms and single and named coloured forms of primrose.

Unlike Magsaysay Lines, it had a smaller boat <b>aptly</b> <b>name</b> the M/V Tamaraw or the River Taxi, as during this same year the Tamaraw FX service became very popular. It offered a seating of 12 people, also air-conditioned, and can be hired like a taxi service for travel along the river, just like a Tamaraw FX taxi. The route stretched from Bambang in Pasig down to Escolta in Manila (a total of 16.2 kilometers). However, like the Magsaysay Lines, Starcraft Ferry only lasted {{for a year and}} it closed in 1997. Like the Magsaysay Lines, the problems encountered during the operation were informal settlers, water lilies (since it prevents the boats from traveling at normal speeds), foul odor and garbage disposed on the river.|$|R
