5000|$|In the Southern Ocean in the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>zone,</b> nanophytoplankton are {{the most}} {{abundant}} type of plankton in terms of number, but not volume. Antarctic marine flora consists almost entirely of algae, with phytoplankton, and therefore nanophytoplankton, being the most numerous type, as having great importance. Nanophytoplankton growth has been seen in pack-ice, covering nearly 73% of the Southern Ocean {{by the end of}} the winter. They even grow on icebergs. Nanophytoplankton production is affected by light intensity and duration, ice, surface water stability, and currents. Also, availability of silicates, a nutrient for the organism, can affect photosynthetic efficiency and cell composition. [...] Nanophytoplankton also require vitamins. They thrive in areas of shallow water where there is upwelling and mixing. Although optimal growth for the species occurs in water 5-7 °C, growth still occurs in Antarctic waters, which can reach as low as -2 °C. Limitation of light intensity and duration is another factor for survival. In Antarctica, the sun’s lower position above the horizon reduces light due to increased reflection, and the stormy seas reduce transmission of light due to bubble formations. However, some Antarctic nanophytoplankton seem to be adapted to low light levels. Most phytoplankton exist in warmer, equatorial waters. For example, in the northwestern Philippine Sea, the average number of nanophytoplankton was 1x10^4/l. It is the nanophytoplankton in particular that seem to survive better under the conditions provided by the oceans of the Antarctic. A physiological change in the cells must have occurred to allow this phenomenon. Low salinity is desirable for survival, as well.|$|E

The correspondence b tween barium and opal supports the applicability of barium as a proxy for productivity. Within the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>zone</b> north of today's average sea ice maximum, interglacial vertical rain rates of excess barium are high, with a maximum occurring during the last deglaciation and early Holocene and during oxygen isotope chronozone 5. 5. During these periods, the maximum silica accumulation was supposedly located south of the polar front. Glacial paleoproductivity, instead, was low within the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>zone.</b> North of the polar front, significantly higher barium accumulation occurs during glacial times.

40|$|Chlorophyll a and {{nutrient}} concentrations along with temperature and salinity values were measured at 22 CTD stations along a 735 -km transect {{running to the}} northwest of the island of South Georgia, Southern Ocean. Measurements were repeated during five summer surveys (January and February 1994, January 1996, December 1996, January 1998) and one spring survey (October 1997). The transect sampled Sub-Antarctic Zone water in the north, Polar Frontal Zone water and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Zone</b> water in the south. Chlorophyll a concentrations were lowest {{to the north of}} the transect and frequently high (up to 17 [*]mg[*]m− 3) in the deep open ocean of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Zone.</b> Sub-surface peaks were measured in all zones and chlorophyll a was detectable to a depth of 150 [*]m. There was a clear latitudinal temperature gradient in the near-surface waters (0 – 50 [*]m), the warmest water occurring in the north (∼ 12 [*]°C), and the coolest in the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Zone</b> (∼ 2 [*]°C). There was also a well-defined latitudinal gradient in summer near-surface silicate concentrations (∼ 2, 4, and 10 [*]mmol[*]m− 3 in the Sub-Antarctic Zone, the Polar Frontal Zone and the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Zone,</b> respectively), increasing to > 20 [*]mmol[*]m− 3 near South Georgia. Distinct differences in silicate concentrations were also evident in all three zones to a depth of 500 [*]m. Near-surface nitrate and phosphate concentrations were relatively low {{to the north of the}} transect (∼ 14 and 1 [*]mmol[*]m− 3, respectively) and higher in the Polar Frontal Zone and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Zone</b> (∼ 18 and 1. 4 [*]mmol[*]m− 3, respectively). Ammonium and nitrite were restricted to the upper 200 [*]m of the water column, and exhibited sub-surface concentration peaks, the lowest being in the Sub-Antarctic Zone (0. 68 and 0. 25 [*]mmol[*]m− 3, respectively) and the highest in the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Zone</b> (1. 72 and 0. 29 [*]mmol[*]m− 3, respectively). Surface (∼ 6 [*]m) spring nutrient measurements provided an indication of pre-bloom conditions; ammonium and nitrite concentrations were low (∼ 0. 27 and 0. 28 [*]mmol[*]m− 3, respectively), while silicate, nitrate and phosphate concentrations were high and similar to previously measured winter values (e. g. ∼ 26, 23, 2 [*]mmol[*]m− 3, respectively in the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Zone).</b> Although the values measured were very variable, and there was some evidence of a seasonal growth progression, the chlorophyll a {{and nutrient}} distribution patterns were dominated by intercruise (interannual) factors. Approximate nutrient depletions (spring minus summer) appeared similar in the Polar Frontal Zone and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Zone</b> for nitrate and phosphate, while silicate showed a marked latitudinal increase from north to south throughout the transect.

40|$|Antarctic {{terrestrial}} {{communities are}} characterised by their geographical isolation and {{the survival of}} extreme environmental stresses. Of particular significance to life history strategies of organisms in continental and maritime. <b>Antarctic</b> <b>zones</b> is the pronounced seasonality, with short (1 - 4 month) cold summers and long (8 - 11 month) winters. Activity and growth are largely limited to the summer period, although maintenance costs, undetectable in the short-term, may become significant over winter. Sub-Antarctic invertebrate communities experience a less rigorous regime, as climatic extremes are ameliorated by their oceanic environment, with positive mean temperatures occurring over 6 - 12 months. Here, year-round activity and growth of invertebrates are common. This paper considers our limited knowledge of the life histories of sub-Antarctic and Antarctic terrestrial invertebrates, to identify features correlated with seasonal and/or climatic cues. There is little evidence for diapause, although seasonal patterns of variation in cold tolerance and cryoprotectant production in direct response to desiccation and decreasing temperatures have been reported. A rapid response to feeding and growth opportunity is shown by maritime. Antarctic species, irrespective of season, although moulting does not occur over winter. Associated reduction of feeding, along with arrested growth and reproductive activity due to the low thermal energy budget over winter are probably sufficient to explain the peaks of moulting and reproduction often observed {{at the end of}} winter. Generally there is a high level of flexibility in the observed species life histories, with varying developmental duration and much overlap of generations being the norm, particularly in maritime and continental Antarctica. A formal diapause may be a disadvantage in maritime and continental <b>Antarctic</b> <b>zones,</b> as it would be erroneously triggered by severe conditions during summer. In contrast, the development of specific overwintering strategies including diapause may be unnecessary or even irrelevant in much of the sub-Antarctic, where seasonality is greatly reduced and the risk of severe of stressful environmental conditions during winter is negligible...|$|R

The five stations were selected to sample settling particles in the main hydrological zones of the Southern Ocean. The sampling period spanned 425 days (November 28, 1996 -January 23, 1998) and was divided into 13 or 21 synchronized time intervals. A total of 174 sequential samples were recovered and analyzed to estimate fluxes of total mass (TMF), organic carbon, carbonate, biogenic silica, and lithogenic particles. The fluxes of biogenic material were higher than anticipated, challenging {{the notion that the}} Southern Ocean is a low-productivity region. Organic carbon fluxes at 1 km depth within the Polar Frontal Zone and the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Zone</b> were relatively uniform (1. 7 - 2. 3 g/m** 2 /yr), and about twice the estimated ocean-wide average (ca. 1 g/m** 2 /yr). Carbonate fluxes were also high and uniform between the Subantarctic Front and ca. 64 °S (11 - 13 g/m**/yr). A large fraction of the carbonate flux in the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Zone</b> was due to the presence of pteropod shells. Coccoliths were found only {{to the north of the}} Polar Front, and calcium carbonate became the dominant phase in the Subantarctic Zone.

40|$|The Southern Ocean has the {{potential}} to regulate climate via changes in its productivity and circulation regimes. We therefore investigated the glacial/interglacial variability of bioproductivity in the upper water column and bottom water ventilation in the Subantarctic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>zones</b> at two sediment core locations, covering the last 150, 000 years, in the eastern Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. We used a combined approach, and integrated information derived from two major plankton groups, diatoms and organic-walled cysts of dinoflagellates (dinocysts) :- The diatom group Chaetoceros reflects high-carbon/low silica export regimes, the abundance of Fragilariopsis kerguelensis frustules indicates low-carbon/high-silica regimes (Abelmann et al., 2006). Changes in relative abundance of these two types of diatoms in the sedimentary record reflect past changes/shifts in productivity regimes. - The cyst-forming dinoflagellate genus Protoperidinium, the only heterotrophic dinoflagellate to be found as fossil cysts in the study area, feeds predominantly on diatoms such as Chaetoceros (Jacobson and Anderson, 1986), and thus high accumulation rates of Protoperidinium cysts in the sediment might reflect high Chaetoceros production. - Protoperidinioid cysts are highly sensitive to pore water oxygen concentrations in the sediments in which they become embedded, and are used as proxies for a low oxygen sedimentation environment (Zonneveld et al., in press). The direct comparison between Chaetoceros and sensitive dinocyst abundance in the sediment record thus provides information on past primary production and pore water oxygenation, which can be integrated to results derived by other proxies for export productivity (the deep-dwelling radiolarian Cycladophora davisiana), pore water oxygen (authigenic Uranium) and bottom current velocity (percentage of sortable silt). Our study provides an excellent opportunity to assess the causal relationship between upper-ocean regimes (temperature, nutrient gradients, sea-ice extent) and changes in bottom water formation, and suggests higher glacial productivity in both the Subantarctic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>zones</b> synchronously to the production of less ventilated bottom water.

Here, we present the results on the seasonal and vertical variability of biogenic particle and diatom valve fluxes. Total mass and diatom fluxes were highly seasonal, with maxima registered during the austral summer and minima during winter. Biogenic opal dominated sedimentation, followed by carbonate, and very low levels of organic carbon (annual average 1. 4 %). The strong correlation between opal and organic carbon at both depth levels suggests that a significant fraction of organic matter exported to the deep sea was associated with diatom sedimentation events. Seasonal diatom fluxes appear driven principally by changes in the flux of Fragilariopsis kerguelensis.

Beak δ 13 C values ranged from− 25. 7 to − 17. 9 ‰, and were used to assign different cephalopod species to the subtropical, sub-Antarctic or <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Zones.</b> Beak δ 15 N values were more variable among species, ranging from 2. 4 to 13. 3 ‰, a difference of ~ 11 ‰ that represents approx. 3 trophic levels. Differences amongislands in isotope ratios in the same cephalopod species (higher δ 15 N and lower δ 13 C values inSouth Georgia) were attributed to regional oceanographic processes. Antarctic cephalopodsoccupy niches similar to those found in some pelagic fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Ascephalopods are key components in Southern Ocean food webs, these results greatly advance ourunderstanding of the structure, energy and carbon flows in this polar ecosystem...|$|R
