5|$|Dragonflies {{generate}} lift in {{at least}} four ways at different times, including classical lift like an aircraft wing; supercritical lift with the wing above the critical angle, generating high lift and using very short strokes to avoid stalling; creating vortices; and vortex shedding.

5|$|Fungal {{diseases}} include wirestem, {{which causes}} weak or dying transplants; Fusarium yellows, which result in stunted <b>and</b> <b>twisted</b> plants with yellow leaves; and blackleg (see Leptosphaeria maculans), {{which leads to}} sunken areas on stems and gray-brown spotted leaves. The fungi Alternaria brassicae and A.brassicicola cause dark leaf spots in affected plants. They are both seedborne and airborne, and typically propagate from spores in infected plant debris left on the soil surface for up to twelve weeks after harvest. Rhizoctonia solani causes the post-emergence disease wirestem, resulting in killed seedlings ("damping-off"), root rot or stunted growth and smaller heads.|$|E
5|$|Males {{entering}} {{their second}} or third year may develop spotty blue and white plumage during the breeding season. By their fourth year, males have assumed their nuptial plumage, where the scapulars, secondary wing coverts, and secondary flight feathers are white {{while the rest of}} their bodies are a vibrant cobalt blue. All sexually mature males moult twice a year, once before the breeding season in winter or spring, and again afterwards in autumn; rarely, a male may moult directly from nuptial to nuptial plumage. The breeding males' blue plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, is highly iridescent due to the flattened <b>and</b> <b>twisted</b> surface of the barbules. The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum.|$|E

40|$|<b>Twist</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Twist</b> 2 {{are highly}} conserved {{members of the}} Twist {{subfamily}} of bHLH proteins responsible for the transcriptional regulation of the developmental programs in mesenchymal cell lineages. The regulation of such processes requires that <b>Twist</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Twist</b> 2 function as molecular switches to activate and repress target genes by employing several direct and indirect mechanisms. Modes of action by these proteins include direct DNA binding to conserved E-box sequences and recruitment of coactivators or repressors, sequestration of E-protein modulators, and interruption of proper activator/repressor function through protein–protein interactions. Regulatory outcomes of <b>Twist</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Twist</b> 2 are themselves controlled by spatial-temporal expression, phosphoregulation, dimer choice and cellular localization. Although these two proteins are highly conserved and exhibit similar functions in vitro, emerging literature have demonstrated different roles in vivo. The involvement of <b>Twist</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Twist</b> 2 in {{a broad spectrum of}} regulatory pathways highlights the importance of understanding their roles in normal development, homeostasis and disease.

5|$|By February 26 city {{officials}} had determined One Meridian Plaza {{was not in}} danger of collapse. There was structural damage to horizontal steel beams and floor sections {{on most of the}} fire damaged floors. Under extreme fire exposure the beams and girders sagged <b>and</b> <b>twisted</b> and cracks appeared in the concrete floors. However, the overall structure was stable and able to support the weight of the building. Thermal expansion of the steel frame caused some of the granite panels to be dislodged from the building's facade. The streets and buildings around One Meridian Plaza were closed and cordoned off. The 20-story Morris Building and several three-story shops behind One Meridian Plaza on Chestnut Street were damaged by falling debris and sat unused for years until they were demolished in 2000. The neighboring Girard Trust Building, then called Two Mellon Plaza, experienced extensive water damage forcing the closure of the building. A bank in the building reopened a month later {{but the rest of the}} tower remained vacant for years. The roads around the building were closed for months after the fire, including a portion of two of Philadelphia's major streets, Broad and Market.|$|E

5|$|Like other fairywrens, {{the superb}} fairywren is notable for its marked sexual dimorphism, males {{adopting}} a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue contrasting {{with black and}} grey-brown. The brightly coloured crown and ear tufts are prominently featured in breeding displays. The breeding male has a bright-blue forehead, ear coverts, mantle and tail, brown wings, and black throat, eye band, breast and bill. Females, immatures, and non-breeding males are a plain fawn colour with a lighter underbelly and a fawn (females and immatures) or dull greyish blue (males) tail. The bill is brown in females and juveniles and black in males after their first winter. Immature males moult into breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching, though incomplete moulting sometimes leaves residual brownish plumage that takes another year or two to perfect. Both sexes moult in autumn after breeding, with males assuming an eclipse non-breeding plumage. They moult again into nuptial plumage in winter or spring. Breeding males' blue plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, is highly iridescent because of the flattened <b>and</b> <b>twisted</b> surface of the barbules.

5|$|Predators of waders {{breeding}} in wet grasslands include birds such {{as large}} gulls, common raven, carrion and hooded crows, and great and Arctic skuas; foxes occasionally take waders, {{and the impact}} of feral cats and stoats is unknown. Overgrazing can increase predation by making nests easier to find. In captivity, the main causes of chick mortality were stress-related sudden death <b>and</b> <b>twisted</b> neck syndrome. Adults seem to show little evidence of external parasites, but may have significant levels of disease on their tropical wintering grounds, including avian malaria in their inland freshwater habitats, and so they might be expected to invest strongly in their immune systems; however, a 2006 study that analysed the blood of migrating ruffs intercepted in Friesland showed that this bird actually has unexplained low levels of immune responses on at least one measure of resistance. The ruff can breed from its second year, and the average lifespan for birds that have passed the chick stage is about 4.4 years, although a Finnish bird lived to a record 13 years and 11 months.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} serious {{injuries}} were multiple lower leg fractures and dislocations, spinal fractures, hip fractures, head injuries, and multiple lacerations and contusions. The NTSB investigators found severe {{damage on the}} floor of the cabin, leading many of the passengers' seats to fracture where the legs met the floor track. This fracturing permitted many of the seats to come loose during the impact and aggravated the passengers' injuries. The report posits that the passengers' legs hit the lower seat frames in front of them. At the same time, the seats collapsed <b>and</b> <b>twisted</b> downward and to the left, likely causing hip and spinal fractures. As the impact progressed, the seats, now separated, flung passengers forward into each other as well as into other wreckage, causing head injuries and lacerations. Passengers holding onto infants reported being unable to either prevent their children from being ejected from their grasp in the impact or locate their children in the darkness afterward. The NTSB held that, had the children been in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved child seats, many injuries might have been mitigated. Rescuers remarked that some infants were found smiling or seemingly unharmed. The NTSB was unable to accurately chart where individual passengers were seated because Avianca only assigned seats to a few passengers and many who were assigned reported moving after takeoff.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Twist</b> 1 a <b>and</b> <b>twist</b> 1 b are the {{principal}} components of twists that negatively regulate a number of cellular signaling events. Expression of runx 2 and downstream targets is essential for skeletal development and ventral organizer formation and specification in early vertebrate embryos, but what controls ventral activity of maternal runx 2 <b>and</b> how <b>twists</b> function in zebrafish embryogenesis still remain unclear. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By studying the loss of twist induced by injection of morpholino-oligonucleotide in zebrafish, we found that <b>twist</b> 1 a <b>and</b> <b>twist</b> 1 b, but not twist 2 or twist 3, were required for proper skeletal development and dorsoventral patterning in early embryos. Overexpression of twist 1 a or twist 1 b following mRNA injection resulted in deteriorated skeletal development and formation of typical dorsalized embryos, whereas knockdown of <b>twist</b> 1 a <b>and</b> <b>twist</b> 1 b {{led to the formation}} of abnormal embryos with enhanced skeletal formation and typical ventralized patterning. Overexpression of twist 1 a or twist 1 b decreased the expression of runx 2 b, whereas <b>twist</b> 1 a <b>and</b> <b>twist</b> 1 b knockdown increased runx 2 b expression. We have further demonstrated that phenotypes induced by <b>twist</b> 1 a <b>and</b> <b>twist</b> 1 b knockdown were rescued by runx 2 b knockdown. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Together, these results suggest that <b>twist</b> 1 a <b>and</b> <b>twist</b> 1 b control skeletal development and dorsoventral patterning by regulating runx 2 b in zebrafish and provide potential targets for the treatment of diseases or syndromes associated with decreased skeletal development...|$|R

MethodsThe expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, TGF-β 1 <b>and</b> <b>Twist</b> protein in 59 prostate cancer tissues and 21 adjacent tissues were detected by immunohistochemical SABC staining, and the correlation with clinicopathological features was analyzed. ResultsPositive rates of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, TGF-β 1 <b>and</b> <b>Twist</b> were 32. 2 %, 54. 2 %, 71. 2 % and 74. 6 %, respectively, in prostate cancer tissues and 85. 7 %, 9. 52 %, 19. 0 % and 9. 52 %, respectively, in cancer-adjacent tissues, with {{significant differences between the}} two groups (P 20 μg/L group, but the positive expression of Twist was not significant between groups.

The scapula did not expand at the upper end but was very expanded at the base. The coracoid was mainly thin and plate-like. The humerus had a slender shaft, was slightly twisted along its length, and was slightly bowed. The deltopectoral crest (where the deltoid and pectoral muscles attach) was weakly developed. The ends of the ulna were expanded, and ridges extended along the shaft. The radius was more robust than the ulna, which is unusual. When seen from above, the pelvic girdle was very broad for a bipedal archosaur, and became wider towards the hind part. The broadness of the pelvic region may have accommodated a rear extension of the gut. The ilium was elongated and the ischium was long and slender. Though the pubis is not known, it was probably reduced in size like that of Homalocephale.
