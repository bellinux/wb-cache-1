50|$|While {{the idea}} of dorsoventral <b>axis</b> <b>inversion</b> appears to be {{supported}} by morphological and molecular data, others have proposed alternative plausible hypotheses (reviewed in Gerhart 2000). One assumption of the inversion hypothesis is that the common ancestor of protostomes and chordates already possessed an organized central nervous system located at one pole of the dorsoventral axis. Alternatively, this ancestor may have possessed only a diffuse nerve net or several bundles of nervous tissue with no distinct dorsoventral localization. This {{would mean that the}} apparent inversion was simply a result of concentration of the central nervous system at opposite poles independently in the lineages leading to protostomes and chordates. Lacalli (1996) suggested a scenario in which the ancestor had a single opening to the digestive system, and that the neural and non-neural mouths arose independently in protostomes and chordates, respectively. By this hypothesis, {{there is no need for}} inversion.|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Several {{phases of}} animal {{evolution}} have undergone {{radical change in}} developmental mechanisms. I refer to these as major transitions in animal evolu-tion. The six most important transitions in the lineage leading to humans are pro-posed to be: the origin of multicellularity, the origin of two-germ layers and radial symmetry, the origin of three-germ layers and bilateral symmetry, dorsoventral <b>axis</b> <b>inversion,</b> the origin of vertebrates, the origin of gnathostomes. Here I discuss the genetic changes that may have underlain these transitions. The last two tran-sitions were accompanied by, and possibly facilitated by, large increases in gene number. This probably occurred by tetraploidy, {{with some of the}} duplicate genes being subsequently lost. The origin of three germ-layers, bilateral symmetry and a through gut also probably involved gene duplication; in this case, duplication of an ancestral ProtoHox gene cluster to yield two paralogous homeobox gene clus-ters, Hox and ParaHox, with roles in patterning different germ layers along the anteroposterior body axis. This event may provide a partial genetic explanation for the Cambrian explosion...|$|E
40|$|As {{the closest}} outgroup to the Bilateria, the Phylum Cnidaria {{is likely to}} be {{critical}} to understanding the origins and evolution of body axes. Proteins of the decapentaplegic (DPP) /bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2 / 4 subfamily are central to the specification of the dorsoventral (D/V) axis in bilateral animals, albeit with an <b>axis</b> <b>inversion</b> between arthropods and chordates. We show that a dpp/BMP 2 / 4 ortholog (bmp 2 / 4 -Am) is present in the reef-building scleractinian coral, Acropora millepora (Class Anthozoa) and that it is capable of causing phenotypic effects in Drosophila that mimic those of the endogenous dpp gene. We also show that, during coral embryonic development, bmp 2 / 4 -Am expression is localized in an ectodermal region adjacent to the blastopore. Thus, a representative of the DPP/BMP 2 / 4 subfamily of ligands was present in the common ancestor of diploblastic and triploblastic animals where it was probably expressed in a localized fashion during development. A localized source of DPP/BMP 2 / 4 may have already been used in axis formation in this ancestor, or it may have provided a means by which an axis could evolve in triploblastic animals. David C.

40|$|Recent {{molecular}} genetic {{analyses of}} Drosophila melanogaster and mouse {{central nervous system}} (CNS) development revealed strikingly similar genetic patterning mechanisms {{in the formation of}} the insect and vertebrate brain. Thus, in both insects and vertebrates, the correct regionalization and neuronal identity of the anterior brain anlage is controlled by the cephalic gap genes otd/Otx and ems/Emx, whereas members of the Hox genes are involved in patterning of the posterior brain. A third intermediate domain on the anteroposterior axis of the vertebrate and insect brain is characterized by the expression of the Pax 2 / 5 / 8 orthologues, suggesting that the tripartite ground plans of the protostome and deuterostome brains share a common evolutionary origin. Furthermore, cross-phylum rescue experiments demonstrate that insect and mammalian members of the otd/Otx and ems/Emx gene families can functionally replace each other in embryonic brain patterning. Homologous genes involved in dorsoventral regionalization of the CNS in vertebrates and insects show remarkably similar patterning and orientation with respect to the neurogenic region (ventral in insects and dorsal in vertebrates). This supports the notion that a dorsoventral body <b>axis</b> <b>inversion</b> occurred after the separation of protostome and deuterostome lineages in evolution. Taken together, these findings demonstrate conserved genetic patterning mechanisms in insect and vertebrate brain development and suggest a monophyletic origin of the brain in protostome and deuterostome bilaterians...|$|E

40|$|AbstractNK {{genes are}} related pan-metazoan {{homeobox}} genes. In the fruitfly, NK genes are clustered {{and involved in}} patterning various mesodermal derivatives during embryogenesis. It was therefore suggested that the NK cluster emerged in evolution as an ancestral mesodermal patterning cluster. To test this hypothesis, we cloned and analysed the expression patterns of the homologues of NK cluster genes Msx, NK 4, NK 3, Lbx, Tlx, NK 1 and NK 5 in the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii, a representative of trochozoans, the third great branch of bilaterian animals alongside deuterostomes and ecdysozoans. We found {{that most of these}} genes are involved, as they are in the fly, in the specification of distinct mesodermal derivatives, notably subsets of muscle precursors. The expression of the homologue of NK 4 /tinman in the pulsatile dorsal vessel of Platynereis strongly supports the hypothesis that the vertebrate heart derived from a dorsal vessel relocated to a ventral position by D/V <b>axis</b> <b>inversion</b> in a chordate ancestor. Additionally and more surprisingly, NK 4, Lbx, Msx, Tlx and NK 1 orthologues are expressed in complementary sets of stripes in the ectoderm and/or mesoderm of forming segments, suggesting an involvement in the segment formation process. A potentially ancient role of the NK cluster genes in segment formation, unsuspected from vertebrate and fruitfly studies so far, now deserves to be investigated in other bilaterian species, especially non-insect arthropods and onychophorans...|$|E
40|$|The {{widely held}} {{notion of an}} {{independent}} evolutionary origin of invertebrate and vertebrate brains is based on classical phylogenetic, neuroanatomical and embryological data. The interpretation of these data in favour of a polyphyletic origin of animals brains is currently being challenged by three fundamental findings that derive from comparative molecular, genetic and developmental analyses. First, modern molecular systematics indicates {{that none of the}} extant animals correspond to evolutionary intermediates between the protostomes and the deuterostomes, thus making it impossible to deduce the morphological organization of the ancestral bilaterian or its brain from living species. Second, recent molecular genetic evidence for the body <b>axis</b> <b>inversion</b> hypothesis now supports the idea that the basic body plan of vertebrates and invertebrates is similar but inverted, suggesting that the ventral nerve chord of protostome invertebrates is homologous to the dorsal nerve cord of deuterostome chordates. Third, a developmental genetic analysis of the molecular control elements involved in early embryonic brain patterning is uncovering the existence of structurally and functionally homologous genes that have comparable and interchangeable functions in key aspects of brain development in invertebrate and vertebrate model systems. All three of these findings are compatible with the hypothesis of a monophyletic origin of the bilaterian brain. Here we review these findings and consider their significance and implications for current thinking on the evolutionary origin of bilaterian brains. We also preview the impact of comparative functional genomic analyses on our understanding of brain evolution...|$|E
40|$|Classical phylogenetic, neuroanatomical and neuroembryological studies propose an {{independent}} evolutionary {{origin of the}} brains of insects and vertebrates. Contrasting with this, data from three sets of molecular and genetic analyses indicate that the developmental program of brains of insects and vertebrates might be highly conserved and suggest a monophyletic origin of the brain of protostomes and deuterostomes. First, recent results of molecular phylogeny imply {{that none of the}} currently living animals correspond to evolutionary intermediates between protostomes and deuterostomes, thus making it impossible to infer the morphological organization of an ancestral bilaterian brain from living specimens. Second, recent molecular genetic evidence provides support for the body <b>axis</b> <b>inversion</b> hypothesis, which implies that a dorsoventral inversion of the body axis occurred in protostomes versus deuterostomes, leading to the inverted location of neurogenic regions in these animal groups. Third, recent developmental genetic analyses are uncovering the existence of structurally and functionally homologous genes that have comparable and interchangeable functions in early brain development in insect and vertebrate model systems. Thus, development of the anteriormost part of the embryonic brain in both insects and vertebrates depends upon the otd/Otx and ems/Emx genes; development of the posterior part of the embryonic brain in both insects and vertebrates involves homologous control genes of the Hox cluster. These findings, which demonstrate the conserved expression and function of key patterning genes involved in embryonic brain development in insects and vertebrates support the hypothesis that the brains of protostomes and deuterostomes are of monophyletic, urbilaterian origin...|$|E

40|$|The {{polarisation}} {{of cells}} and tissues is fundamental for tissue morphogenesis during biological development and regeneration. A {{deeper understanding of}} biological polarity pattern formation can be gained from the consideration of pattern reorganisation {{in response to an}} opposing instructive cue, which we here consider by example of experimentally inducible body <b>axis</b> <b>inversions</b> in planarian flatworms. Our dynamically diluted alignment model represents three processes: entrainment of cell polarity by a global signal, local cell-cell coupling aligning polarity among neighbours and cell turnover inserting initially unpolarised cells. We show that a persistent global orienting signal determines the final mean polarity orientation in this stochastic model. Combining numerical and analytical approaches, we find that neighbour coupling retards polarity pattern reorganisation, whereas cell turnover accelerates it. We derive a formula for an effective neighbour coupling strength integrating both effects and find that the time of polarity reorganisation depends linearly on this effective parameter and no abrupt transitions are observed. This allows to determine neighbour coupling strengths from experimental observations. Our model is related to a dynamic $ 8 $-Potts model with annealed site-dilution and makes testable predictions regarding the polarisation of dynamic systems, such as the planarian epithelium.

The polar switching in three symmetrically substituted BTAs with alkyl chains varying in length between 6 and 18 carbon atoms (C 6, C 10, and C 18) was investigated by electro-optical switching experiments, dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS), and solid-state NMR The goal was to characterize ferroelectric properties of BTA-based columnar LCs, which display a macroscopic axial dipole moment due to the head-to-tail stacking of hydrogen-bonded amides. The Col(hd) phase of all three BTAs can be aligned uniformly by a dc field similar to 30 V/mu m. Moreover, C 10 and C 18 display extrinsic polar switching characterized by a remnant polarization and coercive field of 1 - 2 mu C/cm(2) and 20 - 30 V/mu m, respectively. In {{the absence of an}} external field, the polarization is lost in 1 - 1000 s, depending on device details and temperature. DRS revealed a columnar glass transition in the low-temperature region of the LC phase related to collective vibrations in the hydrogen-bonded columns that freeze out below 41 - 54 degrees C. At higher temperatures, a relaxation process is present originating from the collective reorientation of amide groups along the column <b>axis</b> (<b>inversion</b> of the macrodipole). Matching activation energies suggest that the molecular mechanism underlying the polar switching and the R-processes is identical.

In both cases, the rays entering the eye have the same orientation (red above, green below) so the image is not inverted in the direc-tions parallel to the plane mirror. However, Fig. 1 also shows that if the front (white) side of an object is seen when looking directly at it, then the back (blue) side is nate axes, as in Fig. 2 (a). Starting with this right hand, students will find that inverting only one axis (e. g. the index finger) can only be accomplished by changing to a left hand, as in Fig. 2 (b). This illustrates why the single <b>axis</b> <b>inversion</b> due to a plane mirror changes handedness. The handedness of a coordinate system can also be treated mathematically in terms of the cross-product of its Cartesian unit vectors. For a right-handed coor-dinate system, x ̂ y ̂ = +ẑ, (1) When introducing the optics of mirrors, anobvious place to start is comparing theappearance of objects to their images. Image distance and magnification are usually covered the most thoroughly, but the handedness of images in various shapes of mirrors has also been discussed in The Physics Teacher 1 – 5 and elsewhere. 6 However, {{there has not been a}} systematic treatment of handedness.

40|$|Abstract — Interactive {{visualization}} {{requires the}} translation of data into a screen space of limited resolution. While currently ignored by most visualization models, this translation entails a loss of information {{and the introduction of}} a number of artifacts that can be useful, (e. g., aggregation, structures) or distracting (e. g., over-plotting, clutter) for the analysis. This phenomenon is observed in parallel coordinates, where overlapping lines between adjacent axes form distinct patterns, representing the relation between variables they connect. However, even for a small number of dimensions, the challenge is to effectively convey the relationships for all combinations of dimensions. The size of the dataset and a large number of dimensions only add to the complexity of this problem. To address these issues, we propose Pargnostics, parallel coordinates diagnostics, a model based on screen-space metrics that quantify the different visual structures. Pargnostics metrics are calculated for pairs of axes and take into account the resolution of the display as well as potential <b>axis</b> <b>inversions.</b> Metrics include the number of line crossings, crossing angles, convergence, overplotting, etc. To construct a visualization view, the user can pick from a ranked display showing pairs of coordinate axes and the structures between them, or examine all possible combinations of axes at once in a matrix display. Picking the best axes layout is an NP-complete problem in general, but we provide a way of automatically optimizing the display according to the user’s preferences based on our metrics and model.

Previous studies have measured the subtalar joint axis against the axis of the whole foot, the talocrural joint axis and, recently, the principal axes of the talus. The present study introduces a new method for estimating average joint axes from 3 D reconstructions of bones and applies the method to the talus to calculate the subtalar and talocrural joint axes. The study also assesses the validity of the principal axes as a reference coordinate system against which to measure the subtalar joint axis. In order to define the angle of the subtalar joint axis relative to that of another axis in the talus, we suggest measuring the subtalar joint axis against the talocrural joint axis. We present corresponding 3 D vector angles calculated from a modern human skeletal sample. This method is applicable to virtual 3 D models acquired through surface-scanning of disarticulated ‘dry’ osteological samples, as well as to 3 D models created from CT or MRI scans...|$|R
