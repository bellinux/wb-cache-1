5|$|The large, maze-like mansion's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} with angles slightly askew, resulting in off-center perspectives and doors that {{open and close}} by themselves. The immense library contains the ramshackle spiral staircase from which the previous owner hanged herself; the vast conservatory is adorned with eerie statues. During their first night in the house, Eleanor and Theo are terrified by supernatural occurrences outside Theo's bedroom door. Deafening banging is heard <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{and the voice of}} a young girl is heard echoing with laughter. Despite the turbulence, Eleanor feels a tentative affinity to Hill House.|$|E

25|$|However, inward-hinged doors {{can also}} {{escalate}} an accident by preventing people from escaping the building: {{people inside the}} building may press <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> and thus prevent <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> from opening. This was partly {{the case in the}} Grue Church fire in Norway in 1822.|$|R
25|$|In {{the morning}} of only the second day, a {{rebellion}} broke out among the volunteer prisoners. They ripped off their uniforms and locked themselves in their cells by pushing their beds up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> In response to this, the guards became very angry and called for backup. This surprised Zimbardo {{as well as the}} rest of the psychologists because they had not thought it would be taken this far. Guards who were not on duty were called in and the guards who were assigned to only the night shift stayed with the guards who came in all the way through their shift the next morning. The tactic the guards came up with was to fight back in order to discipline the unruly prisoners and make them obey. In response to the prisoners barricading themselves in their cells, the guards used fire extinguishers on them to get them away from the entrances.|$|E
25|$|One weekend, Shaista is {{kidnapped by}} a chauffeur posing {{as the one}} sent by her uncle to take her home. That night there is another murder in the Sports Pavilion, where Miss Vansittart is found dead, having been coshed. Many of the girls go home, but the {{resourceful}} Julia, who has been pondering the exchange of the racquets, takes her racquet {{back to her room}} and discovers gems in the hollowed-out handle. She hears someone at the door who quietly turns the knob and attempts to enter. Julia places furniture <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to prevent entry and is ready to scream out loud but the person who turned the knob leaves, identity unknown. The following day Julia flees the school to tell her story to Hercule Poirot, of whose career she learned from a friend of her mother. The police focus on the newcomer, Miss Blanche, who knows the identity of the murderer. She is killed for attempting blackmail. With three unsolved murders and the school hemorrhaging fearful students, Poirot arrives.|$|E
500|$|In the {{illustration}} of Peter {{standing by the}} locked door, the verbal narrative describes the scene without the flippancy evident {{in the moment of}} the sieve. The inability to overcome obstacles is presented in the verbal narrative with objective matter-of-factness and the statement, [...] "Peter began to cry" [...] is offered without irony or attitude, thus drawing the reader closer to Peter’s emotions and plight. The illustration depicts an unclothed Peter standing upright <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> one foot upon the other with a tear running from his eye. Without his clothes, Peter is only a small, wild animal but his tears, his emotions, and his human posture intensifies the reader’s identification with him. Here, verbal narrative and illustration work in harmony rather than in disharmony. Scott suggests Potter’s tale has encouraged many generations of children to [...] "self-indulgence, disobedience, transgression of social boundaries and ethics, and assertion of their wild, unpredictable nature against the constrictions of civilized living." ...|$|E
5000|$|Exit {{doors opened}} inward, into the auditorium. <b>The</b> crowd pressed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> keeping them closed. When people {{were able to}} pull <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> open enough to get out, some people were then wedged in <b>the</b> <b>door</b> opening as people {{continued}} to push on <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Today, exit doors open outward, so that people trying to escape will tend to hold <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> open.|$|R
60|$|While I {{was still}} doubtful, it rapped smartly <b>against</b> <b>the</b> cellar <b>door</b> and closed it.

50|$|In Charles Kingsley's romantic history Hereward the Wake (1866), Hereward smashes his ash lance <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of <b>the</b> Westgate, Winchester showing by the {{strength}} of his arm that it is he. William the Conqueror is so impressed that he pardons him.|$|R
500|$|... "I'm Her Slave" [...] is {{a heroin}} anecdote with lyrics narrated by a subjugate lover. Music critic Greg Kot cites [...] "Turn On the Water" [...] {{as an example}} of when [...] "the twisted narrator is the victim" [...] and [...] "cast adrift" [...] in Dulli's lyrics. Inspired by a {{paranoid}} breakup, [...] "Conjure Me" [...] is told from the perspective of an aggressive predator and obscure object of desire. On [...] "Kiss the Floor", the narrator recounts stealing a girl's virginity and avoiding her brothers. [...] "This Is My Confession" [...] has a theme of absolution. The lyrics depicts it as an empty sexual experience: [...] "Shove my head <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> crawl inside and kiss the floor / Waiting for the sun again, drink it, smoke it, stick it in." [...] "The Temple" [...] is a cover of the song of the same name from the 1970 rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar. Dulli became a fan of the rock opera as a child when his babysitter played it. [...] "Let Me Lie to You" [...] has lyrics expressing passive cruelty and subtle manipulation. [...] "Tonight" [...] depicts a peaceful night as the backdrop for the narrator's corrupt one-track mind: [...] "Follow me down to the bushes, dear / No one will know, we'll disappear / I'll hold your hand, we'll never tell / Our private little trip to hell". The album's hidden track [...] "Miles Iz Ded" [...] is about seduction and alcohol, with a last call sensibility and despairing tone.|$|E
500|$|Some {{effects were}} {{achieved}} {{in ways that}} are not immediately obvious. In one scene, a supernatural force pushes against the parlor door and bends it inward repeatedly. Though the door appears to some viewers to have been made of latex, it was in fact made of laminated wood (with a strong crew member pushing a piece of timber hard <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>door).</b> Two physical effects were used to make the spiral staircase in the library appear frightening. In one scene, the camera appears to ascend the staircase at a rapid rate. However, the point of view is backward, looking down the staircase, as the camera used the staircase's handrail as a dolly track, being lowered slowly by means of a wire. When the sequence was run in reverse at high speed, the effect was frightening. In another scene, the staircase appears to become unstable and give way as Luke Sanderson ascends it. Later, Eleanor goes up the staircase in a trance-like state. She is rescued by Dr. Markway, even as the staircase seems ready to collapse. The collapsing staircase effect was designed by a metalworker at the Borehamwood studios. The effect was created by tying portions of the steps and railing to a cable that ran inside the staircase's central pole. When the cable was slackened, these elements moved freely. [...] When tightened, the staircase appeared solid and stable. The effect was so disturbing to the cast that Robert Wise had to ascend the staircase while it was shaking in order to prove it was safe. Other effects also relied on simple cinema tricks. Early in the film, the audience sees Abigail Crain lying in bed, aging from a young child to an old woman. A camera was fixed over the bed, and four different actresses (each a different age) posed in the bed beneath the camera. Dissolves were used to show the aging process. In another scene, the characters come across a [...] "cold spot" [...] in the haunted mansion. To show the physical effect on the characters, the makeup department applied special makeup to the characters that appeared invisible in normal light. To show the effect of cold on the skin, filters were gradually drawn over the lights on the set, revealing the [...] "cold effect" [...] makeup.|$|E
2500|$|A {{report of}} their final {{service at the}} Sydenham Street Methodist Church in 1889 said the {{galleries}} were filled by women five minutes after the doors were opened. [...] "Then the dear ladies banked themselves <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> waiting so patiently for {{the time when they}} could crowd on the main floor. It was the final night! Theatre goers know what that means." ...|$|E
60|$|The breathing-time thus {{afforded to}} the assailed {{was used in}} {{strengthening}} their defences and holding a hurried council of war. Piling several heavy pieces of furniture <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> and directing <b>the</b> women to make additions to these, Christian drew Alric into the hall, where the ancient retainers were already assembled.|$|R
60|$|There {{was now a}} rush <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of <b>the</b> house. The people sent up {{a hoarse}} cry. At this instant the lieutenant-governor's daughter, whom he had {{supposed}} to be in a place of safety, ran into the room and threw her arms around him. She had returned by a private entrance.|$|R
50|$|In 1965 and 1967 Senior Constable Alan Walker (1964-67) {{requested}} a septic system, and in 1968 this request was repeated by Senior Constable Luis Olsen (1968-73), who also {{asked that the}} back entrance landing be enclosed, as well as part of east veranda, where rain was beating <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> into <b>the</b> main bedroom and the lounge.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the end of}} this scene, Martha {{starts to}} act seductively towards Nick in George's presence. George pretends to react calmly, reading a book. As Martha and Nick walk upstairs, George throws his book <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> In all {{productions}} until 2005, Honey returns, wondering who rang the doorbell (Martha and Nick had knocked into some bells). George comes {{up with a plan to}} tell Martha that their son has died, and the act ends with George eagerly preparing to tell her. In what is labeled the [...] "Definitive Edition" [...] of the script, however, the second act ends before Honey arrives.|$|E
2500|$|A {{white man}} was {{reported}} by a lone witness to have walked halfway up to King's door and thrown something <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> before running back to his car and speeding off. Ernest Walters, the lone witness, did not manage to get the license plate number because of how quickly the events transpired. Both of the couple's fathers contacted them over the bombing. The two arrived nearly at the same time, along with her husband's mother and brother. Coretta's father Obie said he would take her and her daughter back to Marion if his son-in-law did not take them to Atlanta. Coretta refused the proclamation, and insisted on staying with her husband. Despite Martin Luther King, Sr. also advocating that she leave with her father, King persisted in leaving with him. Author Octavia B. Vivian wrote [...] "That night Coretta lost her fear of dying. She committed herself more deeply to the freedom struggle, as Martin had done four days previously, when jailed {{for the first time}} in his life." [...] Coretta would later call it the first time she realized [...] "how much I meant to Martin in terms of supporting him in what he was doing".|$|E
2500|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] he {{was saying}} as I approached, [...] "what do we mean when we say that a man is 'some pumpkins'? We mean that he is full of ideas just as a pumpkin is full of seeds. What do we mean when we {{say that he is}} a 'brick'? Why, a brick is part of a building. Let us now {{consider}} the attraction of gravitation, that mysterious force which binds together atoms and worlds, princes and parallelograms, cones, pyramids and the Sphinx. A traveler is lost on a Western prairie. He has wandered all day, far from home and with nothing to eat. Night comes on. The wolves begin to howl in the darkness. At last he reaches a log cabin, almost in ruins. No matter, it will afford him shelter for the night. Scarcely has he entered and composed himself to rest when a violent storm arises. Thunders roar. Lightnings flash. The snow heaps <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> It grows bitterly cold. What shall he do? He can't stay there and freeze to death. Let me illustrate. Two darkies, walking down Broadway, saw a quarter of a dollar on the sidewalk. One of the colored gentlemen said to his companion, 'Sambo, don't you freeze to dat quarter. I seed it first.' That is just the idea. He can't stay there and freeze. His soul—but {{what do we know about}} the soul? Is it homogeneous or heterogeneous? Who can tell? Who except me, Daniel Pratt, the Great American Traveler, and soon to be President of the United States? Why not? Was not imperial Rome once saved by the cackling of a goose?" ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Valerius Maximus: [...] "When {{the senate}} decreed that the temples of Isis and Serapis be {{demolished}} {{and none of}} the workmen dared touch them, consul Lucius Aemilius Paullus took off his official gown, seized an axe, and dashed it <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of that temple", (I, 3.3; quoting Julius Paris (translation from Loeb edition).|$|R
60|$|As soon {{as death}} had thinned the jam, Garthwaite, still {{grasping}} my arm, led {{a rush of}} survivors into the wide entrance of an office building. Here, at <b>the</b> rear, <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> we were pressed by a panting, gasping mass of creatures. For some time we remained in this position without {{a change in the}} situation.|$|R
50|$|With {{the efforts}} of {{determined}} astronauts in Endeavours payload bay and persistent engineers on the ground, all four bolts finally latched and locked after the two spacewalkers worked simultaneously {{at the top and}} bottom of <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> Musgrave anchored himself at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> with a payload retention device which enabled him to use some body force <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> Hoffman, who was attached to the robot arm, worked at the top of <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> <b>The</b> duo successfully latched <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> when they simultaneously latched the top and bottom latches.|$|R

60|$|Without {{the delay}} of an instant, {{he threw himself}} headlong over the bannisters into the lobby below. He had hardly touched the ground when Barnaby was at his side. The chaplain's assistant, and some members who were imploring the people to retire, {{immediately}} withdrew; and then, with a great shout, both crowds threw themselves <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> pell-mell, and besieged the House in earnest.|$|R

50|$|Byron {{launched}} an offensive {{from the south}} with 5,000 men <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Parliamentarian garrisons in Cheshire, {{most of which were}} quickly captured. The troops recently returned from Ireland behaved with a degree of ruthlessness not previously displayed in the English Civil War. At Barthomley Church on 26 December, the Parliamentarian garrison surrendered after the Royalists lit a fire <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> to smoke them out. At least twelve of the prisoners, mostly local militia, were executed with Byron's approval.|$|R
60|$|When {{these were}} {{completed}} {{the whole of}} the garrison, including the ladies and native servants, again set to work filling sandbags with earth. As fast as they were finished they were carried in and piled two deep <b>against</b> <b>the</b> lower windows, and three deep <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> only one small door being left undefended, so as to allow a passage {{in and out of the}} house. Bags were piled in readiness for closing this also in case of necessity.|$|R
