50|$|When {{considering}} {{engine efficiency}} one should consider {{whether this is}} based on the lower heating value (LCV) or higher heating value (HCV) of the gas. Engine manufacturers will typically quote efficiencies based on the lower heating value of the gas, i.e. the efficiency after energy has been taken to evaporate the intrinsic moisture within the gas itself. Gas distribution networks will typically charge based upon the higher heating value of the gas (i.e. total energy content). A quoted engine efficiency based on LCV might be say 44% whereas the same engine might have an HCV of 39.6% based on HCV on natural gas.It is also important to ensure that efficiency comparisons are on a like for like basis. for example some manufactures have mechanically driven pumps whereas other use electrically driven pumps to drive engine cooling water, and the electrical usage can sometimes be ignored giving a falsely high <b>apparent</b> <b>efficiency</b> compared to the direct drive engines.|$|E

The <b>apparent</b> quantum <b>efficiency</b> values of TiO 2, Ce–TiO 2, Ce–B–TiO 2, Ce–C–TiO 2, Ce–N–TiO 2, and Ce–S–TiO 2 were 1.6, 6.7, 10.2, 9.2, 17.2, and 2.2  %, respectively. The calculated values agreed with the reported <b>apparent</b> quantum <b>efficiency</b> range of 2 – 22  % for different photocatalysts [45]. For comparison, the photocatalytic activity of N–TiO 2 was also measured. The <b>apparent</b> quantum <b>efficiency</b> of N–TiO 2 (8.6  %) was slightly higher than that Ce–TiO 2 (6.7  %) but the efficiency increased significantly for co-doped Ce–N–TiO 2 to 17.2, suggesting that both doping components were contributory to photocatalytic activity, as discussed earlier, giving higher hydrogen production.

Changes in bacterial community structure were analyzed by in situ hybridization and revealed members of the Cytophaga/Flavobacterium cluster and of the � subclass of Proteobacteria to be the main actors.

Holstein calves (n = 160) were fed 90 to 244 g of IgG from CS or CR in 1 or 2 feedings in two experiments.

In the second part we assume the validity of the Shannon entropy and thermodynamic temperature, T=dE/dS, extended to systems under non-equilibrium steady state. Contrary to equilibrium, we discuss the possibility and meaning of a negative temperature in this case.

Twenty-four multiparous Latxa dairy ewes at d 16 of lactation were divided into two groups of 12 ewes each.

Ewes also had free access to tall fescue hay, water, and mineral salts. The experimental period lasted for 25 d, of which the first 14 d were for treatment adaptation and the last 11 d for measurements and samplings. Supplementation with CHI decreased total (p = 0. 043) and fescue (p = 0. 035) dry matter intake (DMI), but did not affect concentrate DMI. Supplementation with CHI, moreover, increased plasma glucose (p = 0. 013) and BUN concentrations (p = 0. 035), but did not affect those of non-esterified fatty acids.

40|$|Eighty Holstein and Holstein cross dairy calves {{were blocked}} by birth date and {{randomly}} assigned to 1 of 8 treatments within each block to {{examine the effect of}} a colostrum replacer (CR) feeding regimen, supplementation of CR with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3), and provision of a milk replacer (MR) feeding on IgG absorption. Calves were offered a CR containing 184. 5 g/L of IgG in either 1 feeding at 0 h (within 30 min of birth), with or without 30 g of NaHCO 3, with or without a feeding of MR at 6 h of age, or 2 feedings of CR (123 g of IgG at 0 h with or without 20 g of NaHCO 3 and 61. 5 g of IgG at 6 h with or without 10 g of NaHCO 3), with or without a MR feeding at 12 h. Therefore, treatments were (1) 1 feeding of CR; (2) 2 feedings of CR; (3) 1 feeding of CR + 30 g of NaHCO 3; (4) 2 feedings of CR + 30 g of NaHCO 3; (5) 1 feeding of CR + MR feeding; (6) 2 feedings of CR + MR feeding; (7) 1 feeding of CR + 30 g NaHCO 3 + MR feeding; and (8) 2 feedings of CR + 30 g NaHCO 3 + MR feeding. Blood samples were obtained at 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h after birth and were analyzed for IgG via radial immunoassay. Results indicated that CR feeding schedule, MR feeding, and the interactions CR × Na, CR × MR, and CR × Na × MR were similar for 24 -h serum IgG, <b>apparent</b> <b>efficiency</b> of absorption, or area under the curve. Serum IgG at 24 h, <b>apparent</b> <b>efficiency</b> of absorption, and area under the curve were decreased with addition of NaHCO 3 compared with calves not supplemented with NaHCO 3. These data indicate that supplementation of CR with NaHCO 3 is not beneficial to IgG absorption and feeding MR within 6 h of CR feeding does not affect IgG absorption...|$|E
40|$|Redistribution ofthe p-type dopants Zn, Mg, and Cd ion {{implanted}} in GaAs was examined for two capless annealing techniques: rapid thermal annealing, and radio-frequency annealing {{in an environment}} containing arsine. It was found that <b>apparent</b> activation <b>efficiency</b> was controlled by the degree of evaporation of the dopant in either annealing tech-nique. Although considerable r distribution occurred {{at the peak of}} the dopant profiles as a result of evaporation, the ex-tent of in-diffusion of the dopants was minimized by both cap]ess annealing techniques. In comparison to the in-diffusio...|$|R
40|$|Optofluidics {{may hold}} the key to greater success of {{photocatalytic}} water treatment. This is evidenced by our findings in this paper that the planar microfluidic reactor can overcome the limitations of mass transfer and photon transfer in the previous photocatalytic reactors and improve the photoreaction efficiency by more than 100 times. The microreactor has a planar chamber (5  cm x 1. 8  cm x 100  μm) enclosed by two TiO₂-coated glass slides as the top cover and bottom substrate and a microstructured UV-cured NOA 81 layer as the sealant and flow input/output. In experiment, the microreactor achieves 30 % degradation of 3 ml 3 x 10 ⁻⁵M methylene blue within 5 min and shows a reaction rate constant two orders higher than the bulk reactor. Under optimized conditions, a reaction rate of 8 %[*]s⁻¹ is achieved under solar irradiation. The average <b>apparent</b> quantum <b>efficiency</b> is found to be only 0. 25 %, but the effective <b>apparent</b> quantum <b>efficiency</b> reaches as high as 25 %. Optofluidic reactors inherit the merits of microfluidics, such as large surface/volume ratio, easy flow control, and rapid fabrication and offer a promising prospect for large-volume photocatalytic water treatment.

40|$|The {{particle}} size of sediment in natural streams is modified by sorting, mixing, solution, and abrasion. Abrasion is the physical process(es) occurring during stream-flow events that causes wear (weight loss) of sedimentary particles. The deterministic cobble abrasion model assumes wear {{is proportional to}} total frictional work done on the particle (Etot). Etot equals the work done by bed friction (Eb) plus the work done by dynamic bed-load friction caused by the motion of nearby particles. Eb is estimated by Eb = (3 x 10 ⁻⁴) Ww x •⁴⁵y•⁵⁵ where Eb = work done by bed friction (ergs) Ww = particle weight in water (grams) y = fall (cm) x = distance moved (cm) Dynamic bed-load friction is not calculable but is assumed to vary directly with size and concentration of moving bed load. Wear is related to total work by abradibility, a factor inversely proportional to sphericity, roundness, and inherent rock strength. Traceable cobbles were abraded in ephemeral streams in southern Arizona. The <b>apparent</b> abrasion <b>efficiency</b> (weight loss per erg of work done by bed friction) varied approximately with discharge squared. Field wear measurements compare reasonably well with prior laboratory measurements. Roundness changes, transport over bedrock, and en route weathering affect the <b>apparent</b> abrasion <b>efficiency</b> observed in natural streams...|$|R
