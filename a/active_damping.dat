40|$|Tests are {{performed}} on a flexure-pivot-pad tilting-pad bearing {{with a series}} integral squeeze film damper in load-between-pads configuration, with both <b>active</b> and locked <b>damper.</b> The damper effects are negated when locked, resulting in a flexure-pivot-pad bearing only. Experimental tests provide static performance data and dynamic stiffnesses from which rotordynamic coefficients are extracted. The following two excitation schemes are implemented: (1) multi-frequency, single direction excitation and (2) single-frequency, rotating load excitation (or "circular excitation"). The XLTRC 2 Rotordynamics Software Suite provides stiffness and damping coefficient, eccentricity, and power loss predictions for the locked damper bearing. Test conditions include the rotor-speed range of 4000 - 12000 rpm and the unit-load range of 0 - 862 kPa (0 - 125 psi). Dynamic tests utilizing the multi-frequency excitation for the locked and <b>active</b> <b>damper</b> bearing configurations both show that the real portion of the dynamic stiffness is well modeled by a quadratic curve fit, and the imaginary portion representing the damping is a linear function of excitation frequency. This means that frequency independent coefficients can be obtained when an added mass term is included. While stiffness coefficients are lower for the <b>active</b> <b>damper</b> bearing, damping coefficients remain almost constant between the locked and <b>active</b> <b>damper</b> configurations. A simulation shows that, although the damping coefficients do not change significantly, the reduced stiffness provided by the damper results in greater effective damping. Static performance tests for the locked and <b>active</b> <b>damper</b> bearing indicate low cross-coupling, {{as shown by the}} eccentricity and low attitude angle measurements. Pad metal temperature measurements show a smaller temperature differential along the pad arcs for the <b>active</b> <b>damper</b> bearing, than observed for the locked damper case. Frictional power loss is estimated based on lubricant temperature rise and does not differ significantly for the two bearing configurations...|$|R

In weak grids, however, the phase-locked loop (PLL) dynamics may detrimentally affect the stability of grid-connected inverters due to interaction between the PLL and the controller. In order to solve the problem, the impact of PLL dynamics on small-signal stability is investigated for the <b>active</b> <b>damped</b> LCL-filtered grid-connected inverters with capacitor voltage feedback. The system closed-loop transfer function is established based on the Norton equivalent model by taking the PLL dynamics into account. Using an established model, the system stability boundary is identified from the viewpoint of PLL bandwidth and current regulator gain. The accuracy of the ranges of stability for the PLL bandwidth and current regulator gain is verified by both simulation and experimental results.|$|R
