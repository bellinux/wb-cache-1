40|$|Although several <b>access</b> <b>control</b> {{policies}} can be devised for <b>controlling</b> <b>access</b> to information, all existing <b>authorization</b> models, <b>and</b> {{the corresponding}} enforcement mechanisms, {{are based on}} a specific policy (usually the closed policy).

While the claimant might provide a personal certificate that can be used for authentication, the more general questions are related to the issue of authorization: how can a user be certain that the agent is truly authorized to act on behalf of the organization and that the agent is acting in a legally-binding manner? Similarly, how can the organization be held liable for the digital signatures its authorized agents provide? This paper elaborates on possible means of addressing these and similar questions.

40|$|Abstract — Pervasive {{computing}} is {{a future}} technology {{that provides a}} user with the capability to compute and communicate from everywhere. In a pervasive computing environment, a user interacts with many smart devices around him to obtain some useful services from them. These smart devices can be either genuine or malicious. Users privacy is at a greater risk, as they are prone to revealing their location, identity and transactions information to such devices. On the other hand, user authentication is also very much required for <b>authorization</b> <b>and</b> service <b>access</b> <b>control.</b> This allows smart devices to provide services to only authorized users. However, authentication and privacy protection are conflicting issues. In order to protect users from invasion of privacy, they {{must be allowed to}} interact anonymously with other smart devices. Thus, authenticating and authorizing an anonymous user becomes a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient “capability-based privacypreserving” scheme for pervasive computing environments. The proposed scheme allows a user to anonymously interact with service providers or other smart devices and also allows the service providers to effectively authenticate and authorize users based on the anonymous information submitted by them.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Computer Science) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2012 With {{the rapid}} {{proliferation}} {{of new technologies}} and services in the wireless domain, spectrum scarcity {{has become a major}} concern. Cognitive radios (CRs) arise as a promising solution to the scarcity of spectrum. A basic operation of the CRs is spectrum sensing. Whenever a primary signal is detected, CRs have to vacate the specific spectrum band. Malicious users can mimic incumbent transmitters so as to enforce CRs to vacate the specific band. Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are expected to bring an evolution to the spectrum scarcity problem through intelligent use of the fallow spectrum bands. However, as CRNs are wireless in nature, they face all common security threats found in the traditional wireless networks. Common security combating measures for wireless environments consist of <b>authorization,</b> authentication, <b>and</b> <b>access</b> <b>control.</b> But CRNs face new security threats and challenges that have arisen due to their unique cognitive (self-configuration, self-healing, self-optimization, and self-protection) characteristics. Because of these new security threats, the use of traditional security combating measures would be inadequate to address the challenges. Consequently, this research work proposes an Intrusion Detection and Response Model (IDRM) to enhance security in cognitive radio networks. Intrusion detection monitors all the activities in order to detect the intrusion. It searches for security violation incidents, recognizes unauthorized <b>accesses,</b> <b>and</b> identifies information leakages. Unfortunately, system administrators neither can keep up with the pace that an intrusion detection system is delivering responses or alerts, nor can they react within adequate time limits. Therefore, an automatic response system has to take over this task by reacting without human intervention within the cognitive radio network. Master...|$|R
