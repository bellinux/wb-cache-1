5|$|Eventually, Richard Maibaum {{provided}} the screenplay, and <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> tried to incorporate ideas {{from all of}} the other writers into his script. Maibaum's original script featured an alliance of international terrorists attacking SPECTRE's headquarters and deposing Blofeld, before trying to destroy the world for themselves {{to make way for a}} New World Order. However, this was shelved.|$|E

5|$|After {{using the}} plot of the aborted 1884 {{collaboration}} with Archer to complete Widowers' Houses (it was staged twice in London, in December 1892), Shaw continued writing plays. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> made slow progress; The Philanderer, written in 1893 but not published until 1898, had to wait until 1905 for a stage production. Similarly, Mrs Warren's Profession (1893) was written five years before publication and nine years before reaching the stage.|$|E
5|$|As a freshman, Cabral was {{the second}} slowest runner on the soccer team. He tried out for track {{to work on his}} speed. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> ran the 400 meters in 68 seconds. By the end of the spring, he broke 10 minutes in the 2 mile and was {{considering}} joining the cross country team instead of participating in his usual fall sport, soccer. In the summer of 2005, the cross country coach sent him a letter of encouragement.|$|E
5|$|As a result, Homer goes on {{tour with}} the festival and hangs out with The Smashing Pumpkins, Cypress Hill, and Sonic Youth. Homer {{suddenly}} finds himself living the high life: partying with big name rock stars and becoming respected among American youth, including Bart. As the tour approaches {{a stop in}} Springfield, Homer's stomach begins to hurt and he is sent to a veterinarian. The veterinarian advises Homer that if he performs his act one more time, he will die. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> decides to do his job, {{but at the last}} second he dodges the cannonball. Consequently, he is released from the festival and, despite a warm sendoff from the rock stars, goes back to not being respected by his children.|$|E

5|$|As a teenager, {{he worked}} in the woods, shoed horses, and drove heavy equipment. He met Emile Dupré in 1957, who told him to {{consider}} a career in professional wrestling. Cormier began training, and later moved to Indianapolis, Indiana to continue his preparation under trainer Les Ruffen, and made his debut in 1963. <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> <b>he</b> used the ring name Pierre Lebelle before switching to Ivan the Lumberjack. In Texas, he was known as Joe Gump. When he later ventured to the Mid-Atlantic territory, Jim Crockett, Sr. named him The Beast. At that time, he had thick, untamed hair and a large, curly beard.|$|E
5|$|By {{the terms}} of his parole, Mallory was not {{permitted}} to hold public office, so he made a living by reopening his old law practice. Nominally excluded from politics, he managed to make his views known by writing letters and editorials for Florida newspapers. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> urged acceptance of the reconstituted Union and acquiescence in the policies of Reconstruction, but he soon came out in opposition, particularly against black suffrage.|$|E
5|$|Concerning the {{development}} of the much-discussed final scene intended to show the friends Korra and Asami becoming a romantic couple, Bryan Konietzko explained that <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> and DiMartino did not give the idea much weight, assuming they {{would not be able to}} get approval for portraying their relationship. But during the production of the finale they decided to test that assumption, approached the network and found them supportive up to a certain limit. They decided to change the final scene from Korra and Asami only holding hands to also facing each other in a pose referencing the marriage scene a few minutes prior.|$|E

5|$|Edinburgh Zoo {{was created}} by Thomas Haining Gillespie, a {{solicitor}} from Dumfries who dreamed of establishing a zoological park in Scotland. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> was told that tropical animals {{would never be able}} to live in a cold climate like Edinburgh's—a view that had to some extent been borne out by the failure of the Royal Zoological Gardens. In 1908, though, he was encouraged to read of the pioneering methods employed by Carl Hagenbeck, which were allowing tropical animals to thrive in the recently opened Tierpark Hagenbeck in Hamburg, Germany.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Noel Lee wanted {{to improve the}} sound quality from his home audio equipment. He didn't have very much money, so Lee experimented with ways to create a better sound by {{improving}} inexpensive cabling. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> worked out of his family's apartment and later in his in-laws' garage, which they rented from family after moving to the Richmond district in 1978. Lee experimented with different widths, winding methods, and qualities of copper and insulation in audio cables to find {{an alternative to the}} zip cord audio vendors gave out for free. He compared different wire constructs, while listening to Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture.|$|E
5|$|In the {{practice}} nets, the county players towered over Larwood; the veteran Test batsman George Gunn {{thought he looked}} more like a jockey than a cricketer. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> bowled badly, and his efforts were unimpressive. As his confidence increased his bowling improved, and committee members began to revise their initial dismissive judgement; when the session ended, Larwood was offered a playing contract. He accepted instantly; the terms were 32 shillings (£1.60) per week—the same as his mining wages—and he was expected, when not playing, to carry out ground staff duties. Robert Larwood was angry that his son had not asked for more generous terms, but according to Hamilton, Harold would have agreed to anything to escape from the mine, even for a single summer.|$|E

5|$|In the subplot, Bart cuts {{school on}} the day {{students}} were choosing their physical education classes. By the time he shows up, the only option left is ballet. Despite being reluctant <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>he</b> soon discovers {{that he has a}} talent for the dance form, and is invited to star in a school ballet performance. After his performance, school bullies attempt to beat him up, and he runs away. Bart attempts to escape by jumping a trench, but fails to make it and takes a nasty fall. The bullies leave, while Lisa tells Bart how proud she is of him, that they are now kindred spirits.|$|E
5|$|Just before {{graduating from}} Millikin University in 1999, {{someone from the}} college {{recommended}} that West attend the GMA Music in the Rockies event for aspiring musicians. Although West was not interested <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>he</b> attended after learning that other people signed him up and paid his entrance fee. He met a representative from Word Publishing at the event who took interest in him and kept in contact until he graduated. West landed in the finals of a songwriting competition and was offered a songwriting deal in July 1999, five weeks after graduating. After penning songs for well-known musicians like Billy Ray Cyrus and Rachael Lampa, he began touring the United States as an independent artist in 2000 and 2001.|$|E
5|$|Kisnorbo's {{first goal}} for Leicester came on 15 October 2005 against Watford at Vicarage Road, {{which turned out}} to be the match winner. His initial {{appearances}} for Leicester were as a midfielder, and <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> failed to adjust and was booed by his own fans during a 2–1 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday. However, a move back to defence resulted in a change in fortunes for Kisnorbo, and his partnership with then-teammate Paddy McCarthy was instrumental in helping Leicester avoid relegation to League One that season.|$|E

5|$|Police visited Brady {{in prison}} again {{and told him}} of Hindley's confession, which <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> refused to believe.
