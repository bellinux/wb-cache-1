5|$|After {{the renewed}} failure, Sapountzakis was {{relieved}} of his command {{and replaced by}} Crown Prince Constantine. Constantine now proceeded to carefully marshal his forces, bringing up more men and artillery. The Crown Prince formulated <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>plan,</b> whereby his army would feign an attack on Bizani from the southeast, while the main effort would be actually directed on the fortress area's southwestern flank.|$|E
5|$|Ferris {{returns to}} Hoffman in Washington, and they devise <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> to find Al-Saleem. Suspecting he is {{motivated}} more by pride than ideology, they stage a fake terrorist attack {{and set up}} Omar Sadiki (Ali Suliman), an innocent Jordanian architect, as its instigator, hoping Al-Saleem {{will come out of}} hiding and attempt to contact him. Al-Saleem sees TV news coverage of the attack and takes the bait.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents, Germany's federal {{government}} is working on <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> for increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy commercialization, with a particular focus on offshore wind farms. Under the plan, large wind turbines will be erected {{far away from the}} coastlines, where the wind blows more consistently than it does on land, and where the enormous turbines won't bother the inhabitants. The plan aims to decrease Germany's dependence on energy derived from coal and nuclear power plants.|$|E

5|$|Planning of Monastery Road (Township Road209) {{improvements}} began in2003. At that time, $3.8million {{in state}} funding was {{set aside for}} the project, but the Ohio Department of Transportation(ODOT) did not receive the money until2005. By2007, most of the earmarked money was spent on preliminary engineering and planning. Without the money, Morgan Township officials could not afford to upgrade the road, andODOT was barred from spending money on local roads. In2011, deputy director Steve Williams devised <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> that made the township road a state route, and Morgan Township officials transferred the road to ODOT.|$|E

5|$|Washington {{exercised}} {{his presidential}} veto {{power for the}} first time on April 5, 1792 to stop an apportionment act from becoming law. The legislation introduced <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> for distributed seats in the House of Representatives among the various states in a way that the president deemed unconstitutional. After attempting but failing to override the veto, Congress swiftly crafted new legislation, the Apportionment Act of 1792, which Washington signed into law on April 14.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> was {{put forward}} by West Sussex County Council in 1961. This {{proposed}} new neighbourhoods at Broadfield and Bewbush, both of which extended outside the administrative area of the then Urban District Council. Detailed plans were made for Broadfield in the late 1960s; by the early 1970s building work had begun. Further expansion at Bewbush was begun in 1974, although development there was slow. The two neighbourhoods were both larger than the original nine: together, their proposed population was 23,000. Work also {{took place in the}} area now known as Ifield West on the western fringes of the town.|$|E
5|$|As the war {{drew to a}} close, Lincoln's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux; having {{believed}} {{the federal government had}} limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner's Freedmen's Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he had <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> for southern Reconstruction. Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.|$|E
5|$|Charles's {{military}} options disappeared {{with the}} French. Adopting <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>plan,</b> he subverted the imperial election. He sold the County of Glatz to Prussia for a reduced price {{in exchange for}} Frederick's electoral vote. Charles's brother, Klemens August of Bavaria, archbishop and prince-elector of the Electorate of Cologne, voted {{for him in the}} imperial election and personally crowned him on 12 February 1742 in the traditional ceremony in Frankfurt am Main. The next day, Charles's Bavarian capital of Munich capitulated to the Austrians to avoid being plundered by Maria Theresa's troops. In the following weeks, her army overran most of Charles's territories, occupied Bavaria, and barred him from his ancestral lands and from Bohemia.|$|E

5|$|Each of the Christian forces {{felt betrayed}} by the other. <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> was made to attack Ascalon and Conrad took his troops there, but no further help arrived, {{due to the lack}} of trust that had {{resulted}} from the failed siege. This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land. After quitting Ascalon, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. Louis remained behind in Jerusalem until 1149. The discord also extended to the marriage of Louis and Eleanor, which had been falling apart during the course of the Crusade. In April 1149, Louis and Eleanor, who were barely on speaking terms by this time, pointedly boarded separate ships to take them back to France.|$|E
5|$|Each of the Christian forces {{felt betrayed}} by the other. <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> was made to attack Ascalon but this was {{abandoned}} {{due to the lack}} of trust that had resulted from the failed siege. This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land. Following the battle, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. As a result of the attack, Damascus no longer trusted the crusaders, and the city was formally handed over to Nur ad-Din in 1154. Bernard of Clairvaux was also humiliated, and when his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether.|$|E
5|$|Having {{failed to}} {{blockade}} or bottle up the Russian squadron at Port Arthur by sinking blockships in the harbor's channel, the Japanese under Admiral Togo formulated <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>plan.</b> Ships were to mine the entrance from {{the harbor and}} then lure the Russians into the minefield {{in the hopes of}} sinking a number of Russian warships. Under cover of four detachments of torpedo boat destroyers, the minelayer Koru-Maru began to lay mines near the entrance to Port Arthur on the night of 31 March. The Japanese were observed by Admiral Makarov, who believed that they were Russian destroyers whom he had ordered to patrol that area.|$|E
50|$|After {{many years}} of {{industrial}} decline in the Lower Swansea valley, the South Dock of the Swansea Docks complex finally closed in 1969 leaving the area as an industrial wasteland. It was sold to the council for a nominal sum. Initially, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> relief road was proposed to take traffic away from the Oystermouth road. However, there was a government reorganisation in 1974 which decided on <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>planning</b> strategy. By 1975, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>planning</b> strategy had been prepared which identified {{social and economic policy}} objectives with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> regeneration programme.|$|R

5|$|However, a {{shortage}} of developers who understood the necessary changes, and performance problems arising from conversion to and from UTF-16, which is rarely used in a web context, led to delays in the project. As a result, a PHP 5.3 release was created in 2009, with many non-Unicode features back-ported from PHP6, notably namespaces. In March 2010, the project {{in its current form}} was officially abandoned, and a PHP5.4 release was prepared containing most remaining non-Unicode features from PHP6, such as traits and closure re-binding. Initial hopes were that <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> would be formed for Unicode integration, but as of 2014 none had been adopted.|$|E
5|$|In May 1922, John Hylan {{launched}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> for {{the freight}} and passenger tunnel, and the Board of Estimate recommended that $4,080,000 be initially appropriated for the project. The Transit Commission and the Port Authority {{refused to accept the}} plan, as they each had their own plans. This plan was much less extensive than the original plan. The original plan would have had the tunnel from Owl's Head Park under the Narrows to Staten Island, and then continuing to a freight yard to be built in the center of Staten Island, from which a trunk line would run across the Arthur Kill to New Jersey as far as Paterson, before merging with the West Shore Railroad. The new revised plan would only cover the Narrows Tunnel, and a three-mile spur to Arlington Yard.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, both {{growth and}} {{controversy}} accelerated rapidly as <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> was launched {{to develop the}} area known as the Crumbles, a shingle bank on the coast {{to the east of}} the town centre. This area, now known as Sovereign Harbour, containing a marina, shops and several thousand houses, along with luxury flats, was formerly home to many rare plants. Continued growth {{in other parts of the}} town, and the taming of the central marshland into farmland and nature reserves, has turned Eastbourne into the centre of a conurbation, with the appearance from above of a hollow ring.|$|E

5|$|Operation Ferdinand formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception {{intended to}} confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. During early 1944 {{the main thrust of}} deceptions in the Middle Eastern theatre were contained under Operation Zeppelin (including its sub-plan Vendetta), which developed threats against Greece and Southern France, and Operation Royal Flush, which ran political deceptions against Spain and Turkey. On 14 June the Allies committed to a landing in Southern France, codenamed Operation Dragoon (formerly Anvil). Royal Flush and Zeppelin were scaled back, to tone down the threat to France, and it was decided <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> (Ferdinand) was required to cover the intended invasion.|$|E
5|$|Riou {{worked closely}} with Parker's second-in-command, Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson, and Captain Thomas Foley in the lead-up to the Battle of Copenhagen, and Nelson duly {{appointed}} Riou commander of the frigates and smaller vessels, instructing Rious to deploy his ships {{in support of the}} main fleet. As the battle began, several of Nelson's ships of the line ran aground on shoals in the harbour, forcing the improvisation of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> of attack. As Nelson's ships engaged their Danish counterparts, Riou took his frigates in to harass the Trekroner Fort and blockships. Although the frigates were heavily outmatched and dangerously exposed, they maintained the engagement for several hours. The ships suffered heavy casualties, and a splinter hit Riou on the head.|$|E
