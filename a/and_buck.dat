5|$|Because he {{reported}} late, Berg {{spent the first}} three months of the season on the bench. In August, a series of injuries to catchers Ray Schalk, Harry McCurdy <b>and</b> <b>Buck</b> Crouse left the White Sox in need of somebody to play the position. Schalk, the White Sox player/manager, selected Berg, who did a fine job filling in. Schalk arranged for former Philadelphia Phillies catcher Frank Bruggy to meet the team at their next game, against the New York Yankees. Bruggy was so fat that pitcher Ted Lyons refused to pitch to him. When Schalk asked him whom he wanted to catch, Lyons selected Berg.|$|E
25|$|In January 1918, the 2nd Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> {{marched to}} Beaulencourt, later that month {{they moved to}} Havrincourt Wood and then on 9 February to Metz-en-Couture. The 2nd Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> were at Vallulart Camp, Ytres, when on 21 March 1918 the Germans {{launched}} the last-gasp Spring Offensive (Operation Michael). The 2nd Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> were due {{to go into the}} corps reserve when the enemy began the Spring offensive with a colossal bombardment of Allied positions. The Spring offensive led to the furthest advance by either side since 1914. On 22 March 1918 the 2nd Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> were in position around the village of Bertincourt. The 2nd Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> <b>and</b> other battalions of the regiment sustained heavy casualties as part of the defence of the Somme during the Battle of St. Quentin (21–23 March), the First Battle of Bapaume (24–25 March) and in subsequent battles that saw the Germans achieve significant gains. The 2nd Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> were forced back across the old Somme battlefield to the 1916 line on the Ancre. The battalion remained in the Ancre area from 29 March 1918 to 3 April 1918. After the enemy Spring offensive, also known as the Ludendorf offensive, lost its momentum, the Germans launched Operation Georgette in April which the Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> defended against in the Battle of the Lys and subsequent actions. In the summer of 1918, the 2nd Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> held the line at Bailleulemont, near Arras. By August the German offensives had failed and the Allies had launched a counter-attack. In August the 2nd Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> took part in the Battle of Albert (1918) (21–23 August) and the Second Battle of Bapaume (31 August – 3 September) while the 2/4th Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> <b>and</b> the 2/1st Buckinghamshires (both part of 184th Brigade of 61st Division) took part in the advance into Flanders, with both offensives seeing the Allies advance to the Hindenburg Line by early September. The 2nd Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> took part in the offensive against it that saw the Allies break through the defences, taking part in the Battle of Havrincourt (12 September), Battle of the Canal du Nord (27 September – 1 October) and the Second Battle of Cambrai (8–9 October). The regiment then took part in the last actions of the war, taking part in the Battle of the Selle and the Battle of Valenciennes. The 2nd Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> last action of the war was the battle for Escarmain on 23 October 1918 during the Battle of the Selle (17–25 October).|$|R
25|$|The 5th Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks,</b> part Territorial Army, {{was raised}} {{shortly before the}} {{outbreak}} of war in September 1939. The 5th Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> was raised as a 2nd Line duplicate of the 4th Battalion. The battalion {{was assigned to the}} 184th Infantry Brigade, 61st Infantry Division. The 5th Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> remained in a training role throughout the war and did not see active service outside the United Kingdom, aside from briefly serving in Northern Ireland.|$|R
25|$|In January 1916, the 2nd Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> were at Cottes St.Hilaire; the 2nd Division was at {{that time}} taking its turn in the corps reserve. The {{battalion}} later moved to Bethune and then returned to the Festubert trenches. Lieutenant Colonel Richard Crosse took over command of the 2nd Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> on 8 July 1916 and was to lead the battalion for the next 3 years. The 1/4th Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> took part in {{the first day of the}} Battle of the Somme on 1 July 1916, in which the British Army suffered over 60,000 casualties – the largest number sustained in a day by the British Army. The battalions of the Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> on the Western Front saw extensive service during the Battle of the Somme (1 July – 18 November), suffering heavily, including at Mametz Wood, Pozières and at Ancre, the last major subsidiary battle. On 28 July the 2nd Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> moved to front-line trenches near Waterlot farm and sustained heavy casualties at the battle there on 30 July. The 2nd Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> fought on the Somme battlefield at Delville Wood, Guillemont and on 13 November in the battle of Beaumont Hamel: a large attack on the Redan Ridge in the battle of the Ancre. The 2nd Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> sustained many casualties during the battle of Beaumont Hamel, including Captain Ralph Kite who within the previous 12 months, had been awarded the Military Cross and twice mentioned in despatches.|$|R

5|$|The series' January 15, 1981 debut, {{which was}} {{announced}} on October 22, 1980, occurred amid the industry's {{recovery from the}} 1980 Actors strike and NBC's recovery from the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott. The show debuted on a night when both competing networks were airing reruns. Unlike other high-profile debuts from the 1980–81 network television season that had two- and three-hour premieres, such as Dynasty and Flamingo Road, this premiere episode debuted by itself as a one-hour offering. That season, even some holdovers, such as B. J. and the Bear <b>and</b> <b>Buck</b> Rogers, had multi-hour season premieres.|$|E
5|$|They {{encountered}} Native Americans, {{who would}} sometimes demand provisions for passage, but none were given {{and none of}} the incidents ended with violence. The travelers' stores were supplemented by shooting bison, which roamed the Great Plains in huge numbers. Despite being a source of food, the bison were a danger as their stampedes could destroy property and kill irreplaceable stock. In southeastern Idaho, the California Trail separated from the Oregon, <b>and</b> <b>Buck</b> and some {{of the rest of the}} party split off there; they settled in California and remained friends with Meeker until their deaths.|$|E
25|$|The New Year of 1917 {{brought with}} it a period of severe weather {{conditions}} on the Somme plain which led to an unofficial truce between the two sides. In March 1917, the Germans began the withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line (14 March – 5 April) {{and at the end}} of March the 2nd Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> moved from the Somme to the back areas of Arras. The 2nd Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> <b>and</b> other battalions of the regiment saw much involvement in the Arras Offensive (9 April – 16 May), including at the Battles of Scarpe and Arleux. The 2nd Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> took part in the battle of Arras from 11 April and had a leading role in the battle of Arleux on 28–29 April: during the battle the battalion protected the right flank of the Canadian 1st Division which was critical to the capture of the village of Arleux and sustained more than 200 casualties. The battalions of the Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> saw further service in many of the subsidiary battles during the Battle of Passchendaele (also known as Third Ypres) that took place between 31 July–6 November. Some of the battles that the Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> took part in included Menin Road and Polygon Wood in September and early October. The 2nd Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> <b>and</b> the 6th (Service) Battalion, Ox <b>and</b> <b>Bucks</b> also took part in the Battle of Cambrai (20 November–3 December) that saw the first large-scale use of tanks by the British and was the last major battle of the year.|$|R

5|$|During the 2010 off-season, the Blazers' {{front office}} {{experienced}} significant personnel changes beginning in July with {{the announcement of}} new general manager Rich Cho, succeeding former general manager Kevin Pritchard, who was relieved of his duties after the 2010 NBA draft. Cho became the first general manager of Asian descent in NBA history. On August 12, the Trail Blazers signed two new assistant general managers, Bill Branch and Steve Rosenberry. Branch and Rosenberry replaced former assistant general manager Tom Penn, who was released by Portland in March. The organization also made changes to Nate McMillan's coaching staff by hiring Bernie Bickerstaff, Bob Ociepka <b>and</b> <b>Buck</b> Williams, with Bickerstaff assuming the lead assistant coach position due to the departure of Monty Williams. The Blazers acquired rookies Armon Johnson, Luke Babbitt, and Elliot Williams from the 2010 NBA draft and off-season trades. On July 21, Wesley Matthews signed a five-year deal with the Blazers after his former team, the Utah Jazz, declined to match Portland's offer.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} part of the 1960s, however, the Nashville sound had become {{perceived}} as too watered-down by many more traditionalist performers and fans, resulting in a number of local scenes like the Bakersfield sound. A few performers retained popularity, however, such as the long-standing cultural icon Johnny Cash. The Bakersfield sound began in the mid to late 1950s when performers like Wynn Stewart <b>and</b> <b>Buck</b> Owens began using elements of Western swing and rock, such as the breakbeat, in their music. In the 1960s performers like Merle Haggard popularized the sound. In the early 1970s, Haggard was also part of outlaw country, alongside singer-songwriters such as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Outlaw country was rock-oriented and lyrically focused on the criminal antics of the performers, in contrast to the clean-cut country singers of the Nashville sound. By the middle of the 1980s, the country music charts were dominated by pop singers, alongside a nascent revival of honky-tonk-style country with the rise of performers like Dwight Yoakam. The 1980s also saw the development of alternative country performers like Uncle Tupelo, who were opposed to the more pop-oriented style of mainstream country. At the beginning of the 2000s, rock-oriented country acts remained among the best-selling performers in the United States, especially Garth Brooks.|$|E
5|$|Keable {{was raised}} in Bedfordshire and educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge. He entered a {{theological}} college after graduation and was ordained a priest in 1911. He spent {{the next several years}} as a missionary in Africa, stationed on Zanzibar and in Basutoland, before returning to Europe as an army chaplain during the First World War. There, he met {{and fell in love with}} a young nurse, Grace Eileen Joly Beresford Buck, a development over which he eventually quit the Church of England and left his wife, Sybil. Returning to England after the war, Keable resigned his ministry and began to write novels: his first, 1921's Simon Called Peter, became a runaway success and launched Keable into a life of literary celebrity. Increasingly disillusioned with the hypocrisies he saw in contemporary British life, he <b>and</b> <b>Buck</b> left Europe for Tahiti in 1922. The couple lived there happily until Buck's death in childbirth in 1924, after which Keable's health began to fade. He nonetheless struck up a later relationship with a Tahitian woman, Ina, with whom he had a son, and continued to publish novels until his death of a kidney condition in 1927.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenes with}} Q and Picard {{together}} on a white background were compared {{to those in the}} Warren Beatty <b>and</b> <b>Buck</b> Henry 1978 film Heaven Can Wait by producer Merri Howard and director of photography Jonathan West. These particular scenes caused some problems as there were concerns by the director of photography that Q's white robes would not show up on camera well against the all-white background. They were worried that he might appear simply as a floating head. With both de Lancie and Stewart anticipating re-shoots for these scenes, they were both unhappy as they shot those appearances. However this was filmed late on the last day; de Lancie said that it resulted in both of them looking quite tired. Some scenes were cut {{in order to reduce the}} episode down to the required length. This included a one-page monologue by Marta which would have taken place on the morning after her liaison with Picard, a scene where Picard was to report to La Forge in engineering, audio mention of Dr. Selar and a mention of Scobee Hall – a reference to Dick Scobee, the commander of the Space Shuttle Challenger at the time of the destruction of the vessel.|$|E
