However, Royal Dutch Shell was sued by families of the activists, who accused the company of complicity in the deaths. The company said it never advocated any act of violence against the activists and tried to persuade the government to grant clemency. In 2009, the company agreed to an out-of-court settlement with the families, paying them US$15.5 million.|$|E

500|$|Former {{legislator}} Albert Cheng {{noted that}} had Bokhary been charged under the Police Ordinance, {{and not the}} Offences Against the Person Ordinance, she would have faced a custodial sentence of up to two years; furthermore, the police failed to charge Bokhary for allegedly assaulting a policewoman {{at the police station}} after her arrest; the police also prosecuted her for careless driving instead of the more serious offence of dangerous driving. Cheng said: [...] "The public certainly has the right to voice its anger against any injustice. But, in this case, its targets shouldn't be the government or the courts, but Secretary for Justice Wong Yan-lung, who is responsible for prosecutions and all government legal matters." [...] Legislator and former Secretary for Security, Regina Ip, said: [...] "At the end of the day, the sense of outrage is not <b>about</b> <b>justice</b> and penalties, but about the widening inequality between rich and poor, between the corporate giant and the artless individual, and the yawning asymmetry of money, knowledge and expert power between the haves and have-nots of our society." [...] Political commentator Michael Chugani agreed that public anger existed due to the belief that Hong Kong society had become too unfair, and that the verdict was confirmation to some of this view. He said that the public outrage responsible for forcing the Department of Justice to appeal against Bokhary's sentence was unlikely to result in a happy ending because both outcomes were potentially damaging: the jailing of Bokhary would imply the judicial system had succumbed to public pressure; if she was not jailed, the system would be tarnished by accusations of favouritism.|$|E

In the original position, individuals choose principles of justice (what kind of society to form, and how primary social goods will be distributed), unaware of their individual characteristics—their race, sex, class, or intelligence, whether they are able-bodied or disabled, rich or poor—and therefore unaware of which role they will assume in the society {{they are about to}} form.|$|E

2500|$|Abaza Hasan was {{described}} in contemporary sources primarily in negative terms, as Ottoman writers sought to emphasize the suffering and oppression peasants and townspeople experienced {{at the hands of}} his troops. He was particularly demonized for launching his rebellion {{at the same time as}} the Ottomans were engaged in warfare with non-Muslims. Nevertheless, many positive traits were still attributed to him, particularly with regard to his military skill. The traveler Evliya Çelebi, who met Abaza Hasan on numerous occasions, described him as [...] "the most courageous and brave of all the Abazan people; diligent, proud, a true hero." [...] During his second uprising, his cause also received a great deal of popular support in Istanbul, particularly among the religious preachers, who heralded him as the 'renewer of the faith of the eleventh century'. Thus Abaza Hasan's public image among contemporaries was highly variable, ranging from that of a messianic figure destined to bring <b>about</b> <b>justice,</b> to a cruel and oppressive bandit.|$|E

However, man was never granted civic wisdom which belonged to Zeus or the art of politics, so the race was initially in danger of extinction. [...] Zeus, however, sent Hermes to distribute shame and justice equally among human beings. To Protagoras, this answers Socrates' question why people think that wisdom about architecture or medicine is limited to the few while wisdom <b>about</b> <b>justice</b> and politics is thought to be more broadly understood (322d).|$|E

[...] Al Bashir accused Luis Moreno Ocampo, the ICC's chief prosecutor since 2003, of repeatedly lying in order to damage his reputation and standing. Al Bashir said [...] "The behaviour of the prosecutor of the court, it was clearly the behaviour of a political activist not a legal professional. He is now working on a big campaign to add more lies." [...] He added [...] "The biggest lie was when he said I have $9bn in one of the British banks, and thank God, the British bank and the [...] finance minister … denied these allegations."

That's not trivial." [...] California House member Darrell Issa called the collective effort an unprecedented means for upsetting a backroom lobbying effort, and the immediate political efficacy of the widespread online protest was characterised in terms of a sleeping giant having awakened and of a new player being in town. [...] One Silicon Valley lobbyist said the content industry had [...] "a lot to learn," [...] noting that they don't have grassroots support: [...] "There are no Facebook pages to call your congressman to support PIPA and SOPA." [...] The New York Times, which framed the netizens' revolt in terms of the new economy versus the old economy, headlined the activism as a [...] "political coming of age for the tech industry." [...] (James Grimmelmann, an Associate Professor at New York Law School, opined two months later that [...] "Legal systems are like Soylent Green: they're made out of people.
