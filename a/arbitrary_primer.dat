40|$|The {{differential}} display (DD) technique, which {{is widely used}} almost exclusively for eukaryotic gene discovery, was optimized to detect differential mRNA transcription from both pure-culture and soil-derived bacterial RNA. A model system which included toluene induction of todC 1 in Pseudomonas putida F 1 was used to optimize the procedure. At 24 -h tod induction {{was determined to be}} approximately 8 × 107 transcripts/μg or 0. 08 % of the total mRNA. The primer concentration, primer length, annealing temperature, and template, deoxynucleoside triphosphate, and MgCl 2 concentrations were varied to optimize amplification of a todC 1 fragment. The limit of detection of todC 1 by DD was found to be 0. 015 ng of total RNA template or approximately 103 transcripts. Once optimized, a todC 1 C 2 gene fragment from P. putida F 1 RNA was detected by using an <b>arbitrary</b> <b>primer</b> for the reverse transcriptase step in conjunction with the same <b>arbitrary</b> <b>primer</b> and a Shine-Dalgarno primer in the PCR. To verify the results, an <b>arbitrary</b> <b>primer</b> was used to detect recovery of a new salicylate-inducible naphthalene dioxygenase in Burkholderia cepacia JS 150.

Two levels of differentiation were achieved with the AP-PCR approach by use of two different arbitrary primers. With the 19 -mer <b>arbitrary</b> <b>primer</b> T- 7 (first level of differentiation), a good correlation was found between IB and AP-PCR typing. Twenty isolates grouped into six IB types were separated into seven major AP-PCR types. These seven AP-PCR groups were further discriminated into 12 subtypes after genotyping with the <b>arbitrary</b> <b>primer</b> PG- 05 (second level of differentiation). The remaining six isolates, all of different IB types, showed a unique and distinct DNA banding pattern with both of the arbitrary primers, T- 7 and PG- 05. Twenty isolates representing 20 REA types from 15 REA groups were resolved into 13 AP-PCR DNA profiles with the <b>arbitrary</b> <b>primer</b> T- 7. A good correlation was found at this level of differentiation between the major REA groups, Y and M, and AP-PCR typing. While AP-PCR with this primer failed to differentiate isolates in REA groups J, G, R, and B, AP-PCR with PG- 05 resolved these four isolates into four distinct AP-PCR types. In addition, one of three M strains and one of four Y strains displayed a slightly different DNA banding pattern by AP-PCR (with PG- 05) {{from that of the}} other strains in the group. We conclude that AP-PCR is a rapid and sensitive method which not only complements other typing schemes but also may be a substitute and prove to be especially suited for immediate epidemiological tracking of nosocomial infections due to C. difficile...|$|E

The two <b>arbitrary</b> <b>primers</b> (DD 1 and DD 2) with the Oligo d(T) 23 -C generated a total of 18 and 37 unknown messenger RNA (UMR) bands, respectively.

30|$|Molecular biology {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} that can identify DEGs in cells under various physiological stages or experimental conditions. Difficulty often arises in identifying the gene responsible for a specialized function during a certain biological stage because the gene is expressed at low levels, whereas the bulk of mRNA within a cell {{is made up of}} highly abundant transcripts (Wan et al. 1996). Thus, to screen for low concentration DEG transcripts, PCR amplification is required. One screening method, differential-display, requires PCR using short <b>arbitrary</b> <b>primers</b> (Liang and Pardee 1992, 1995). Although this method is simple, rapid and only requires small amounts of total RNA, many investigators have experienced particularly high false-positive rates (Debouck 1995; Wan et al. 1996) and poor reproducibility of their results because of non-specific annealing of the short <b>arbitrary</b> <b>primers.</b> Recently, a new ACP DDRT-PCR method has been developed, and this technology uses a specific primer type to increase both the specificity and sensitivity of the assay (Hwang et al. 2003; Kim et al. 2004).|$|R
