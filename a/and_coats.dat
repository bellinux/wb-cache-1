5|$|In 1868 Mitchell {{joined the}} Bureau of Engraving and Printing and for 40 years {{engraved}} stamped envelopes. Through his BEP work, Mitchell was {{also responsible for}} engraving the seal of the Secretary of the Navy and the Internal Revenue Service. He also engraved the state seals for Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin. Outside {{of state and federal}} government engraving, Mitchell engraved the seals <b>and</b> <b>coats</b> of arms for many well-known institutions which include Harvard University, Society of the Cincinnati, and Boston Public Library. He engraved the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition award medal (1876) which was struck in the Philadelphia Mint. In 1891, Mitchell was invited by the Secretary of the Treasury to join a committee to evaluate the artistic design proposals for a new issue of U.S. coins. The two other members were Charles E. Barber, Chief Engraver of the United States Mint, and Augustus Saint-Gaudens.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes {{are among}} the most {{important}} furbearing animals harvested by the fur trade. Their pelts are used for trimmings, scarfs, muffs, jackets <b>and</b> <b>coats.</b> They are principally used as trimming for both cloth coats and fur garments, including evening wraps. The pelts of silver-morph foxes are popular as capes, while cross foxes are mostly used for scarves and rarely for trimming. The number of sold fox scarves exceeds the total number of scarves made from other furbearers. However, this amount is overshadowed {{by the total number of}} fox pelts used for trimming purposes. The silver morphs are the most valued by furriers, followed by the cross and red morphs respectively.> In the early 1900s, over 1,000 American fox skins were imported to Britain annually, while 500,000 were exported annually from Germany and Russia. The total worldwide trade of wild red foxes in 1985–86 was 1,543,995 pelts. Foxes amounted to 45% of US wild-caught pelts worth $50million. Pelt prices are increasing, with 2012 North American wholesale auction prices averaging $39, and 2013 prices averaging $65.78.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of the church was richly decorated. The walls were plastered and painted in white and maroon with geometric patterns and lines designed {{to give the impression}} of ashlar masonry. Architectural detail was also picked out in maroon. The floors were covered in polychrome encaustic tiles featuring foliage, heraldic beasts, <b>and</b> <b>coats</b> of arms including those of England, France, the Holy Roman Empire, Queen Eleanor of Castile, Richard of Cornwall and many powerful noble families. The chapels in the south transept had tiles with symbols of Edward the Confessor and the Virgin Mary. The windows of the church were filled with painted glass, six panels of which have been recovered. They show scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary, the Crucifixion, monks, monsters and humorous animals.|$|E

40|$|Coated paper {{quality is}} heavily {{affected}} by sheet uniformity, including uniformity {{of the base}} sheet <b>and</b> <b>coating</b> in both the planar and through-thickness design. Controlling this uniformity is easier if the sheet uniformity can be qualitatively or quantitatively defined. For this reason Amcor Research and Technology (ART) has developed a series of techniques designed to describe the sheet structure. These include stereo mosaic imaging of sheet surfaces, power spectrum characterisation of sheet surfaces, cross-section pigment characterisation, <b>and</b> <b>coating</b> penetration <b>and</b> <b>coating</b> uniformity characterisation. Examples {{of the use of}} these methods are described...|$|R
25|$|Numbers {{of doors}} {{are to be}} met with not only in churches but also in private houses. Lavenham, Suffolk, is rich in work of this latter class. In England the general custom was to carve {{the head of the}} door only with tracery (East Brent, Somerset), but in the Tudor period doors were some times covered entirely with linenfold {{paneling}} (St Albans Abbey). This form of decoration was exceedingly common on the Continent as well as in England. In France the doors towards {{the latter part of the}} 15th century were often square-headed, or perhaps had the corners rounded. These doors were usually divided into some six or eight oblong panels of more or less equal size. One of the doors of Bourges Cathedral is treated thus, the panels being filled in with very good tracery enriched with crockets <b>and</b> <b>coats</b> of arms. But a more restrained form of treatment is constantly employed, as at the church of St Godard, Rouen, where the upper panels only are carved with tracery <b>and</b> <b>coats</b> of arms and the lower adorned with simple linenfold design.|$|E
25|$|Like most Nepenthes species, N. jacquelineae is {{primarily}} insectivorous, {{although it does}} occasionally catch other types of invertebrates. The pitcher fluid of N. jacquelineae is extremely viscous <b>and</b> <b>coats</b> the pitcher walls. It {{has been suggested that}} the pitchers of this species function not only as pitfall traps but also as flypaper traps, with the sticky inner walls trapping flying insects above the surface of the fluid. Indeed, this trapping method is employed by the closely related N. inermis, which also produces highly viscous pitcher fluid.|$|E
