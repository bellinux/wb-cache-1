5|$|Cucurbits are {{susceptible}} to diseases such as bacterial wilt (Erwinia tracheiphila), <b>anthracnose</b> (Colletotrichum spp.), fusarium wilt (Fusarium spp.), phytophthora blight (Phytophthora spp. water molds), and powdery mildew (Erysiphe spp.). Defensive responses to viral, fungal, and bacterial leaf pathogens do not involve cucurbitacin.|$|E
25|$|Major leaf {{diseases}} are <b>anthracnose</b> (Gnomonia caryae) and mildew (Microstroma juglandis). The former causes brown spots with definite margins on the undersides of the leaf. These may coalesce and cause widespread blotching. Mildew invades {{the leaves and}} twigs and may form witches' brooms by stimulating bud formation. Although locally prevalent, mildew offers no problem {{in the management of}} hickory.|$|E
50|$|Colletotrichum Cereale is a {{plant disease}} (fungus) {{that has been}} found to cause crown rot <b>anthracnose</b> of turf grass most {{commonly}} occurring on golf courses (NC State 2012). <b>Anthracnose</b> can occur as both a foliar blight and basal rot (Penn State 2010). This disease attacks the crowns of plants, which is different than other <b>anthracnose</b> diseases. <b>Anthracnose</b> of turfgrass can be a foliar disease or in this case a basal rot of the lower portion of the plant. It attacks different species of turfgrass throughout the world most commonly annual bluegrass and creeping bentgrass (Crouch, Clarke 2012).|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} of Raspberry Leaf Spot {{are similar to}} the {{symptoms of}} Raspberry <b>Anthracnose.</b> The best way to differentiate between the two fungal diseases is to inspect the stems of the plant. Stem lesions are indicative of Raspberry <b>Anthracnose.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cultivars that {{excel in}} one climate may fail elsewhere. For example, Indian cultivars such as 'Julie', a {{prolific}} cultivar in Jamaica, require annual fungicide treatments {{to escape the}} lethal fungal disease <b>anthracnose</b> in Florida. Asian mangoes are resistant to <b>anthracnose.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pecan <b>anthracnose</b> {{is caused}} by the fungus Glomerella Cingulate and is a disease of pecan trees that causes {{significant}} losses of yields as it attacks the nut itself. Pecan <b>anthracnose</b> is favored by wet environmental conditions and warm temperatures above 80 degrees Fahrenheit8. Symptoms include dark lesions on the pecan shuck and leaves. The lesions can grow over the entire plant. Signs include pink spores inside of the lesions8. If left untreated, symptoms will get progressively worse throughout the season, progressively reducing yield. Pecans are primarily grown {{in the southern part of}} the United States9, so these warm, wet areas are most susceptible to pecan <b>anthracnose.</b> Pecan <b>anthracnose</b> can occasionally cause zinc deficiencies in the trees it infects; of the cultivars of pecans that are susceptible, Witchita12, Kiowa, Gloria Grande, Pawnee and Mohawk are most prone to zinc deficiencies8. Pecan <b>anthracnose</b> can significantly cost farmers; the disease causes infected trees to produce less nuts and or drop them too early. Additionally, like mentioned above, the lesions of the disease can grow to cover the entirety of a fruit, making the pecan crop unsellable and unconsumable. It is estimated that pecan <b>anthracnose</b> cost Georgia farmers 3.4 million dollars in 2009.|$|E

50|$|Pecan <b>Anthracnose</b> is an ascomycete fungus {{and has a}} {{life cycle}} {{similar to that of}} other ascomycetes11. <b>Anthracnose</b> has an {{overwintering}} stage and survives as an ascocarp. The ascocarp can survive on fallen nuts, leaves and other plant debris. Ascocarps can be spread by the wind or rain. Then, during a rainy, warm spring or summer, the ascocarp releases it’s ascospores and they go off and infect new plants to create more ascocarps which in turn make more ascospores and the life cycle begins again15. <b>Anthracnose</b> is polycyclic, so it has a sexual stage as conidia when it finds its mating type11.|$|E

5000|$|This type of <b>anthracnose</b> affects several plant varieties, {{including}} some brambles and wine grapes. Grape <b>anthracnose</b> {{can be identified}} by the [...] "bird's eye" [...] lesions on the berries and sunken black or greyish lesions on leaves and shoots. From these lesions, conidia are produced. This disease can be lethal to the plant, either through defoliation and removal of photosynthetic capacity, or through injury to the active regions of the vine. Grape <b>anthracnose</b> is particularly important to the wine industry, as it can decrease {{quality and quantity of}} berries produced as well as kill the vine outright, leading to large economic losses, in particular during the middle summer months.|$|E

Estimates on yield grain losses from <b>anthracnose</b> leaf blight and stalk rot range from zero to over 40%. This is dependent on hybrid, environment, timing of infection, and other stresses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anthracnose</b> {{tends to}} develop {{late in the}} {{harvesting}} season. The disease infects soybean by attaching {{to the surface of}} the plant and penetrating the tissue wall. From here <b>anthracnose</b> is able to spread spores throughout the plant, killing branches, pods, and leaves. Once the plant is infected the disease causes defoliation and reduced quality and quantity of soybean seeds. Foliar fungicides applied after blooming control the disease.|$|E
