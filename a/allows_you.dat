25|$|By {{the timing}} of collection, VAT (as well as {{accounting}} in general) can be either accrual or cash based. Cash basis accounting is a very simple form of accounting. When a payment is received {{for the sale of}} goods or services, a deposit is made, and the revenue is recorded as of the date of the receipt of funds—no matter when the sale had been made. Cheques are written when funds are available to pay bills, and the expense is recorded as of the cheque date—regardless of when the expense had been incurred. The primary focus is on the amount of cash in the bank, and the secondary focus is on making sure all bills are paid. Little effort is made to match revenues to the time period in which they are earned, or to match expenses to the time period in which they are incurred. Accrual basis accounting matches revenues to the time period in which they are earned and matches expenses to the time period in which they are incurred. While it is more complex than cash basis accounting, it provides much more information about your business. The accrual basis <b>allows</b> <b>you</b> to track receivables (amounts due from customers on credit sales) and payables (amounts due to vendors on credit purchases). The accrual basis <b>allows</b> <b>you</b> to match revenues to the expenses incurred in earning them, giving you more meaningful financial reports.|$|E
