Alfie {{believes that he}} cannot have children and assumes Kat has cheated on him, despite her insistence to the contrary. Alfie learns that he is wrong, but Kat is hurt by his accusation and will not let him near her, even after suffering a miscarriage. Kat has a one-night stand with Mark Garland (Chris Simmons), which she instantly regrets. She eventually confesses to Alfie, and tells him that her behaviour is how she is <b>and</b> <b>always</b> <b>will</b> <b>be.</b> Alfie tells Kat he would rather have her cheat on him than not have her in his life. The couple attempt to mend relations with each other over Christmas, but Alfie overhears Kat saying that she thinks he no longer loves her. Alfie books a session with a marriage counsellor, which Kat initially refuses to attend. She turns up late, and Alfie tells her the counsellor never arrived. Alfie pays his friend Gerry (Paul Reynolds) {{to pretend to be}} a marriage counsellor, who comes to their home. Kat tells Gerry that she believes Alfie does not love her any more and so she wants to end their marriage.|$|E

500|$|In July 2014, audio leaked of Spears {{singing the}} song without pitch correction. James Lachno of The Daily Telegraph noted that Spears struggles to project {{her voice and}} reach the song's high notes. Critics {{described}} Spears' vocal performance in the leaked track as [...] "flat at best and, at worst, like a strangled cat", [...] "noticeably off-key", [...] "unpolished [...] unflattering", [...] "diabolical", [...] "a style that might kindly be described as tentative", and [...] "toxic to the ears". CNN defended the track, saying that its quality is irrelevant as Spears is not known for her vocal ability. Orbit claimed that the audio was a vocal warm up, {{not expected to be}} a take, and not intended to be heard by the public, adding, [...] "Whomever put this on the internet must have done so in a spirit of unkindness, but it can in no way detract from the fact that Britney is <b>and</b> <b>always</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> beyond stellar!

My conscience will allow nothing else." [...] Shortly thereafter, she clarified her statement: [...] "My faith in Christ is central to my life. My conversion from a pessimistic atheist lost in a world I didn't understand, to an optimistic believer in a universe created and sustained by a loving God is crucial to me.

500|$|On {{the first}} of April 2008, Capcom {{announced}} Sheng Long as a [...] "secret, unlock-able character" [...] in their Japanese development blog for Street Fighter IV and later posted in their official US blog accompanied with a silhouette of the character. The post took the tone of a Capcom PR representative trying to announce a character without giving away too many details, hinting that [...] "Sheng Long is Ryu's..." [...] then holding back and saying to wait for an official character announcement. Similar to the original EGM joke, the post lists the method to unlock him as requiring the player to win every round as Ryu without taking any damage whatsoever and then perform his [...] "Shoryuken" [...] move during the final boss fight. Reception to the joke the third time was negative, and included criticism from 1UP.com.

500|$|Soon {{after his}} death, the Viscount of Inhaúma {{was hailed as}} [...] "one of the {{greatest}} figures of the Brazilian armada" [...] in the Brazilian Senate. He was extremely popular in the armada and was fondly called [...] "Uncle Joaquim" [...] by his subordinates. The Brazilian navy's slang phrase, [...] "andar na Inácia", which meant to behave correctly, was derived from his name. Since 1870, no comprehensive biography of Inhaúma has been published, even though he, according to Francisco Eduardo Alves de Almeira, [...] "is, <b>and</b> <b>always</b> <b>will</b> <b>be,</b> important to the navy of Brazil for his example as a modest and dedicated chief". The Inhaúma-class corvette, built in the 1980s and 1990s, was named after him. Despite the scant attention paid him in historical literature, there are some historians who share a highly positive view of Inhaúma. Américo Jacobina Lacombe {{said that he was}} [...] "one of the greatest names in our [...] military history". Max Justo Guedes regarded him among the greatest imperial navy officers, and Adolfo Lumans considered him one of the greatest navy officers in Brazilian history.|$|E

David Thomson and directors Stanley Donen and Howard Hawks concurred that Grant was the greatest and most important actor {{in the history of the}} cinema. He was a favorite of Hitchcock, who admired him and called him [...] "the only actor I ever loved in my whole life", and remained one of Hollywood's top box-office attractions for almost 30 years. Wansell wrote: [...] "To millions of movie-goers around the world, Cary Grant will forever epitomize the glamour, and the style, of Hollywood in its golden years. With his dark hair, and even darker eyes, mischievous smile and effortless elegance, he was, is, <b>and</b> <b>always</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> indelibly one of the great movie stars. Since his death in 1986, the incandescence of his screen image has not dimmed for a single moment".

While Canning also noted the shift in tone [...] "from despicable Sue to cartoony evil Sue", he enjoyed her [...] "attempt to hijack Secret Santa", and said it was [...] "another fun reason to love to hate Sue Sylvester". Hankinson felt that the Grinch was [...] "the perfect touchstone for the heartless Ms. Sylvester and Jane Lynch's lanky frame made the physical humor (think gliding around the base of the tree on her belly) really sing." [...] Poniewozik called Sue's transformation [...] "pretty amusing to watch", admitted that he doubted he would [...] "have been able to resist the urge to put the rangy Jane Lynch in that classic role" [...] and called Brittany as Cindy Lou Who [...] "unexpected, clever and surprisingly touching".

[...] Chad Presley from Blogcritics felt that, [...] "There's {{a healthy dose of}} nostalgia involved in watching these videos for anyone who grew up during the 1980s in particular. [...] The video quality is a mixed bag. Most of the visual problems crop up during the earlier clips, which were photographed on much more primitive equipment. [...] All things considered, especially when viewed on a Blu-ray player and hi-def TV, this is a pretty rough looking set. Even some of the later videos have an excess of visual noise and are lacking in sharpness." [...] Ian Sturges from Daily Mirror commented, [...] "Celebration is a journey [...] from coquettish wannabe to pop goddess to institution. [...] The videos parallel this transformation from her innocent cavorting on a Venetian gondola for 'Like a Virgin' to the determinedly X-rated couplings of 'Justify My Love' and 'Erotica', both of which were banned. Monica Herrera from Billboard was not impressed with the collection and was disappointed with the [...] "dull quality of the videos. The collection is a probable shame in Madonna's catalogue, but a great one for her fans."
