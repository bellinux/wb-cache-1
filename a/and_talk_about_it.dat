Wayne Clough, the 12th secretary of the Smithsonian Institution assuaged [...] the animosities between critics and proponents of the exhibition: [...] “So I don't think there's anything negative here. I think the Smithsonian tried to do it right. When we heard the concerns, we asked the community to come together <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and we listened, and some people in that audience had their minds changed, as a matter of fact, but not everybody. So, I think it's time {{in a situation like this}} to pause, and for the profession itself to say, [...] "Okay, there's a problem, what are you going to do about it? And, you remember, the United States never signed the UNESCO treaty.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Although {{he would}} play [...] "Miss Misery" [...] in various shows {{throughout}} his career, Smith would often avoid playing <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> It was not heavily requested compared to his other songs, and in one show he dedicated it to the audience.|$|R

5000|$|Noted actress Tippi Hedren was {{discovered}} by Alfred Hitchcock while shooting a television commercial for Sego on the Today Show. Hedren later described the spot as [...] "a story line; it wasn't just holding up a product <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> It was a story and apparently he (Hitchcock) saw it." ...|$|R
500|$|Doherty {{said that}} she decided to work on more family-friendly films for [...] " [...] goddaughter and for [...] brother's seven kids", adding that: [...] " [...] get joy out of their {{watching}} something [...] brother approves of. They can all sit around <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and call [...] afterward." [...] She found the role and the film to be [...] "lighter and fluffier" [...] compared with her earlier work. The actress connected with Silver through their shared dedication to their careers and their decisions to re-prioritize their lives. When approaching her character, Doherty felt that Silver's story arc was about [...] "honoring her grandfather and finding good friends, {{a sense of community}} and love"; she connected with this story line because of her close connections to her own family.|$|E
500|$|Drummer Mullen said of {{the song}} in 1983:"We're into the {{politics}} of people, we're not into politics. Like you talk about Northern Ireland, 'Sunday Bloody Sunday,' people sort of think, 'Oh, that time when 13 Catholics were shot by British soldiers'; that's not what the song is about. That's an incident, the most famous incident in Northern Ireland and it's the strongest way of saying, 'How long? How long {{do we have to}} put up with this?' I don't care who's who – Catholics, Protestants, whatever. You know people are dying every single day through bitterness and hate, and we're saying why? What's the point? And you can move that into places like El Salvador and other similar situations – people dying. Let's forget the politics, let's stop shooting each other and sit around the table <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it...</b> There are a lot of bands taking sides saying politics is crap, etc. Well, so what! The real battle is people dying, that's the real battle." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Carey {{signed a}} new record deal with Island Records and in 2005 she {{released}} her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi. It became the best-selling album of 2005 the United States, and the second best-seller around the world, with over 12 million units sold. It earned a myriad of music industry awards, and brought Carey {{back to the top}} of pop music following her commercial decline in 2001. After completing The Adventures of Mimi Tour, she began working on material for her eleventh studio effort, the yet untitled E=MC². E=MC² was hailed {{as one of the most}} anticipated albums of 2008, with many critics weighing their opinions on whether Carey would be able to deliver significant success, following her achievements with The Emancipation of Mimi. Carey began writing and producing the music she saw fit, and not anything to please record executives. Throughout 2007, Carey recorded the album in a studio built into her private villa in Anguilla, in the Caribbean. She describe E=MC² as one of her most expressive albums, and one that she felt free on, and able to express herself through her music. In an interview with The Bryan Times, Carey spoke of her sentiments on the album [...] "It's hard for me to sit here <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> without sounding like if I'm bragging if I'm in love with it, but I am I love with this album. I think that having the success with the last record allowed me to have more [...] freedom...and just make records that I like. Its kind of a really fun record.|$|E

500|$|The second {{presidential debate}} {{was held on}} October 15 in Richmond, Virginia, and {{included}} questions from undecided voters, who kept the candidates focused on the issues. During his opening statement, Perot explained {{that there was a}} [...] "giant sucking sound" [...] caused by the rush of manufacturing jobs to Mexico. During one exchange, Perot commented that Democrats and Republicans were both to blame for the deficit, but that neither was willing to take responsibility. He joked [...] "somewhere out there, there's an extraterrestrial that's doing this to us, I guess." [...] At the close of the debate, Perot described himself as [...] "results... action oriented", and explained that [...] "if they want to keep slow dancing <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and not do it, I'm not your man." [...] Perot took part in the third debate held in East Lansing, Michigan, on October 19. Throughout the debate, he plugged and referenced his infomercials. He criticized Bush's economic plan to start off the debate, stating that it would not balance the budget. He later remarked that he would spend $60 {{million of his own money}} to finish the race. Notably, Perot brought up the fact that [...] "both parties have foreign lobbyists on leaves and key roles in the campaigns." [...] After the debate, he ripped the media during a press conference, criticizing them for their use of [...] "gotcha" [...] stories and the lack of coverage concerning his opponent's foreign lobbyists. Former pollster Frank Luntz explained, [...] "When Ross Perot uses his head, he's unbeatable. He's focused, straightforward and compelling. When he uses his heart, sometimes his emotions get carried away." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dish has {{reportedly}} {{been criticized for}} treating analysts and major shareholders poorly. Craig Moffett, senior analyst of U.S. telecommunications, U.S. cable, and satellite broadcasting at Sanford C. Bernstein once requested time with management to learn about how Dish does business. Ergen told him, “We’re too busy creating value around here to sit down <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Thanks but no thanks.” Chris Marangi, a money manager for Gamco Investors, which held about 4 millions shares in Dish, said {{that the company is}} very uncooperative. He says that despite traveling to Denver frequently has never been able to get a meeting with Ergen or any other Dish senior manager. “They’re probably the least transparent company of any I’ve ever dealt with." [...] Dish sends out press releases on its earnings deliberately late enough to be of little or no use to analysts and investors whom are then forced to sort through complicated filings submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission.|$|E
2500|$|Arthur and Dana first {{become aware}} of The Tragedy of Arthur at age eleven, when their father gives them a red {{hardcover}} edition of the play, dated 1904, with inscriptions to Arthur Donald [...] "Don" [...] Phillips (Arthur's grandfather) dated 1915, and to A.E.H. Phillips, dated 1942. Upon sharing it with his children, A.E.H. Phillips tells them that its status within the Shakespeare canon is disputed, and insists that they read the play and {{make up their own}} minds about the play's veracity. Dana is much more interested in the text than Arthur – it is the only Shakespeare play she hadn't read – and is allowed to borrow it <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but not make copies or lend it to anyone. A.E.H Phillips ultimately gives the 1904 hardcover to her – [...] "April 22, 1977 For my Dana on her 13th birthday" [...] – in addition to an advertisement for a 1930s London stage production of Shakespeare's Tragedy of King Arthur starring Errol Flynn as Arthur and Nigel Bruce as Gloucester. ("Don't rush to Google that one," [...] Arthur Phillips notes in his narration.) ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} ballet culture's {{conception}} of the body. It explains how the ballet dancer uses the body, sees <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> It analyzes their discourses and practices and renders a description of "The Dancing Body". Thirteen retired ballet dancers were interviewed (7 women, 6 men) about their experiences in this milieu, and three months were spent observing their daily rituals and practices. Through {{the analysis of the}} dancers' lives and the ethnographic notes, it was concluded that "The Dancing Body" is not only a vehicle through which dancers express themselves on stage but that this {{conception of the}} body is weaved into the dancer's identity...|$|R
