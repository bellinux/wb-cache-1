This means that the modulation planes of the two radio signal waves are at 90 degrees angles to each other. The OMT device is used to separate two equal frequency signals, of high and low signal power.Protective separation is essential as the transmitter unit would seriously damage the very sensitive low micro-voltage (µV), front-end receiver <b>amplifier</b> <b>unit</b> at the antenna.|$|E

Some bass amp combos have a removable amplifier.

As well, some amp heads have a small built-in speaker which produces enough sound {{so that it can be}} used as a practice amp, so that the bassist can practice when she/he has the head, but not the speaker cabinet. This way, a bassist in a touring band could practice electric bass using her amp head, even if her speaker cabinets were still locked up in an equipment van.|$|E

Right {{from the start}} of production in 1971 for the Series 3 E-Type, the V12 engine had Lucas OPUS electronic ignition. This system was used until 1982 when the Lucas CEI system was introduced. Initially the OPUS ignition <b>amplifier</b> <b>unit</b> was secured directly to the engine between the cylinder heads and had problems due to overheating. Later cars had the ignition amplifier moved away from the engine where it could get air flow for cooling. Originally the V12 was supposed to get an advanced fuel injection system under development by AE Brico but this plan was cancelled at a late stage, possibly due to concerns that the design was too similar to Bosch products. The V12 as used in the Series 3 E-Types, Series 1 XJ12 and early Series 2 XJ12s (1973-April 1975) had four Zenith-Stromberg side draft carburettors. After April 1975, the V12 engine used in the S2 XJ12 and the new XJS had a Lucas fuel injection system which was based around the Bosch D-Jetronic system.|$|E

50|$|The Stereo Speakers - The contestants must install stereo {{speakers}} {{that are}} to be recessed into the walls of their rooms over their tubs. For this challenge, the nominators will be paired with someone other than their nominee. Matt, paired with Joe-Anne, confuses electrical wire for speaker wire, and is forced to turn to Kory (in Charlene's room) for advice. In the end, he can only get one speaker installed, and fails. Despite a minor hiccup in forgetting to secure his electrical box for the <b>amplifier</b> <b>unit</b> (causing the speaker wire to fall off the wall), Rob (with Charmaine) passes. Dan (with Prabhjot) installs the speakers without much trouble, albeit with one slightly higher than the other, but is deemed to have failed due mixing his plaster improperly and doing an extremely messy job of covering the wires. Ajay (with Natasha) is forced to bite to strip his wire, and installs his speakers vertically, meaning that the sound will not be in stereo. Still, his connections are fine (though there is a knot in the wire neither notices), and he passes. Kory is forced to do most of the gruntwork in Charlene's challenge, and is forced to intervene when he tries to get Charlene to do her own work, only for her to mud over the groove in which she was to install her speaker wire without having installed her wire or electrical box. She fails.|$|E
