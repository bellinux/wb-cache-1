40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the impact to auditor {{independence}} if the mandate to appoint auditor to regulatory body and exist auditor rotation scheme. This study sampled Malaysian auditors, loan officers and senior managers of public listed companies, and questionnaire and interview surveys were used to seek the respondent's perceptions. The majority of the respondents indicated that allocation of audit clients by a regulatory authority would threaten auditor independence. On the other hand, it is found that the majority of the loan officers and senior managers of public listed companies indicated that rotation of audit firms for a specified period of time would safeguard auditor independence, while the majority of auditors disagreed with both of these respondent groups and indicated that such an initiative would threaten independence. However, the respondents in all groups agreed that rotation of <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> would safeguard auditor independence. This might suggest that the type of rotation is not the main concern to the loan officers and senior managers of public listed companies. The significant shift in auditors' perceptions, from rejecting the rotation of audit firms to accepting the rotation of <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> indicates their preference of the rotation of <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> scheme...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} develops {{and tests}} {{a model of}} the client acceptance decision that involves two phases: a diagnostic reasoning/risk evaluation phase and an adversarial problem solving/strategic risk adaptation phase. The model proposes causal linkages between the two phases such that changes in the risk evaluation phase are linked to changes in strategic risk adaptation behavior, which then affects the client acceptance decision outcome. Structural equation modeling is used to statistically estimate the proposed client acceptance model. ^ There are three main findings. First, <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of various client acceptance risks impact each other during the diagnostic process of risk evaluation. Second, <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> use adversarial problem solving when making the client acceptance decision since they link their mental model of the client developed during the diagnostic phase to their suggestions for strategic risk adaptation behavior. Third, strategic risk adaptation behavior is not used to moderate the inverse relationship between client acceptance risks and the client acceptance decision as expected. Instead, <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> distinguish between two client acceptance sub-tasks: deciding whether to accept the client and determining the terms of the client acceptance proposal that would make accepting the client reasonable. ^ There are two primary contributions of this dissertation. First, the client acceptance model illustrates both the structure of the relationship between risk evaluation and strategic risk adaptation behavior (e. g., audit fee, audit evidence, personnel expertise allocation, amount of information collected during the client acceptance process) and also provides a cognitive characterization of that relationship. Second, this dissertation illustrates the usefulness of structural equation modeling as a research methodology well-suited to studying complex situations in accounting and auditing domains. The structural equation modeling approach allows the researcher to test a comprehensive model of how <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> evaluate and adapt to various complex and interrelated risks {{in the context of the}} client acceptance decision. Therefore, this dissertation advances the understanding of expert auditor judgment in the context of the client acceptance decision and demonstrates that structural equation modeling can be a valuable research methodology for understanding expert auditor judgment. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Corporate {{governance}} {{is primarily}} {{the responsibility of}} the governing body of an entity. However, auditors also have an important role to play and their independence is essential to fulfilling that role. Recent developments in auditor independence include an extensive report by Professor Ian Ramsay that was issued in October 2001. The recommendations of the Ramsay Report, if adopted, will help achieve auditor independence through measures such as requiring mandatory audit committees, limiting the involvement of former <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> in client boards, providing greater disclosure of other services provided by auditors, requiring rotation of <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> and establishing an Auditor Independence Supervisory Board. The auditing profession can also assist in this process by issuing new independence guidelines in line with the new IFAC rules issued in November 2001. IFAC’s conceptual approach to independence uses a framework, built on principles, for identifying, evaluating and responding to threats to independence. In addition, specific guidance is required for particular situations...|$|R

40|$|The joint {{provision}} of audit and non-audit services by audit firms to their audit clients has posed {{a threat to}} auditor independence. To mitigate the independence problem, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a regulation (. SEC, 2003) that prohibits <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> from receiving compensation {{for the sale of}} non-audit services to their audit clients. This study examines the effects of this regulatory change on the effort and reporting decisions of <b>audit</b> <b>partners.</b> We show that <b>partners</b> in an <b>audit</b> firm strategically change the firm's liability-sharing rule. As a consequence, the regulation restores truthful reporting but has an undesirable negative effect on audit effort. The effect of the regulation on the welfare of the economy (defined as the total payoff to both audit firms and their clients) hinges on the tradeoff between the benefit of the regulation, which is derived from the inducement of truthful reporting, and the cost of the regulation, which results from less diligent audit work. We show that the regulation is more likely to increase the welfare in a strong legal regime (where the legal liability cost of auditor litigation is high) than in a weak legal regime. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. postprin...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} {{number of years}} whistleblowers have been gaining prominence. This paper investigates some {{of the factors that}} {{influence}} the propensity or willingness to blow the whistle among trainee auditors. Three categories of factors are examined: audit firm organisational structures, personal characteristics of whistleblowers and situational variables. A survey of 240 final year students of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland was undertaken. Trainee auditors (just about to sit their finals) were asked about their confidence in internal and external reporting structures in their firms. Using four scenarios, audit trainees were questioned on their willingness to challenge an <b>audit</b> <b>partner’s</b> inappropriate response to concerns raised during the audit. Finally, audit trainees were asked about the influence of legal protection on their likelihood of whistleblowing. Results indicate that where firms have adequate formal structures for reporting wrongdoing, trainee auditors are more likely to report wrongdoing and have greater confidence that this will not adversely affect their careers. Training increases this confidence. Trainee auditors also express a willingness to challenge an <b>audit</b> <b>partner’s</b> unsatisfactory response to wrongdoing. Significant differences were found in attitudes depending on whether the reports of wrongdoing were internal or external. The willingness to report wrongdoing externally reduces for older (aged over 25) trainees...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 I {{examine whether}} {{accounting}} {{experts on the}} audit committee outperform other financial experts in monitoring financial reporting in the post-SOX era. SOX changed both the audit committee composition and financial reporting quality, indicating that prior findings of the association between accounting expertise and financial reporting quality from the pre-SOX and SOX implementation eras may not generalize to periods after SOX implementation. I find, in the post-SOX era, that accounting experts fail to outperform other financial experts. I then test for the association using former <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> and they too, even with their high levels of accounting expertise, fail to outperform other financial experts. I further investigate this lack of association by examining how the association varies within expert type, based on when the expert was appointed as an audit committee member. I find that pre-SOX appointment former <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> are the only group consistently associated with higher financial reporting quality, suggesting that previously identified incremental associations have been diluted by more recently appointed experts. The results suggest that, broadly, regulation aimed at influencing audit committee composition and expertise altered the previously documented relation. Additionally, they suggest that changing {{the definition of a}} financial expert to be more accounting focused, as recently requested by some investor advocates, is unlikely to improve financial reporting quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{provision}} of assurance services, {{most notably the}} audit function, is an activity of public protection that requires {{a high degree of}} independence between the auditor and the audit client to ensure audit quality is achieved. Internationally, especially in the European Union, there is a legislated move towards mandatory audit firm rotation (MAFR) to ensure auditor independence. South Africa is currently faced with the decision of whether to change legislation and follow suit. Using a qualitative and descriptive methodology, through the use of semi-structured and open interviews with experienced South African <b>audit</b> <b>partners,</b> the direct and indirect effects of mandatory firm rotation on the audit profession was explored. This study will therefore present the opinions of the regulator and a small group of experienced <b>audit</b> <b>partners,</b> most being regional or national managing <b>partners,</b> from <b>audit</b> firms that perform public interest entity audits. Of particular interest will be the opinions of the respondents around (1) the state of independence in South Africa, (2) whether mandatory audit firm rotation will increase audit quality, (3) whether there are better alternatives to mandatory audit firm rotation, and (4) what the perceived direct and indirect effects of mandatory rotation will be within the South African legal and regulatory context. A particular emphasis is also placed on the argument from the national audit regulator that mandatory audit firm rotation, in addition to strengthening independence, will also reduce market concentration (promote competition) in the South African audit industry, as well as promote black economic transformation. The results show significant disagreement by the audit practitioners against the arguments in favour of mandatory audit firm rotation, with most claiming that it will not achieve an increase in audit quality and will produce many unintended consequences that will in their opinion actually reduce audit quality. There is a significant amount of agreement amongst the <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> on the key issues and no partner interviewed is fully in favour of changing legislation to require MAFR. A number of alternative means for improving audit quality are suggested, which in the opinion of many of the partners, will be less damaging to audit quality and the audit profession...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to examine}} the effect of <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> tenure (PARTEN) on client managers' {{accounting}} discretion. Design/methodology/approach – The authors contend that, when a new <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> is from the same audit firm as the outgoing <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> (<b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> rotation), audit quality increases because the new <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> brings “fresh eyes” to the engagement. Findings – The results confirm this conjecture. The authors find that, in the initial years of tenure of a new <b>audit</b> <b>partner,</b> client managers' accounting discretion decreases when the new partner is from the same audit firm as the outgoing partner. However, when the new <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> is from a different audit firm as the outgoing partner (audit firm rotation), it is found that client managers' accounting discretion increases in those initial years. Originality/value – The results provide support for recent legislation in the US restricting audit PARTEN and should be of interest to other regulatory bodies contemplating mandatory <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> rotation. 26 page(s...|$|E
