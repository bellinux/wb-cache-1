5|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 August the Immigration Department issued 2,180 passes to workers and agents to collect visas and submit {{applications}} to work in Hong Kong, promising to handle all <b>applications</b> <b>submitted.</b> Offices opened one hour earlier than usual, added staff and extended their hours to guarantee that all 2,180 cases would be processed. The Philippine consulate also expected a large workload {{as a result of}} the rehiring provisions. Chinese newspapers published articles calculating how households could maximise their benefits under the waiver rules. Street protests on 3 August decried the waiver's unfairness and its burden on the Immigration Department. According to one protester, the waiver would teach households how to use legal loopholes.|$|E

25|$|The HealthCare.gov website was {{launched}} on {{the scheduled date}} of October 1, 2013. Although the government shutdown began on the same day, HealthCare.gov {{was one of the}} federal government websites that remained open through the events. Although it appeared to be up and running normally, visitors quickly encountered numerous types of technical problems, and, by some estimates, only 1% of interested people were able to enroll to the site {{in the first week of}} its operations.

25|$|Mexico's {{inability}} to obtain better results in locating children and taking parents is particularly troubling. Many Convention return applications forwarded by the U.S. Central Authority have languished for years; when children and taking {{parents are not}} located, Mexican courts will not rule on the application. As a result, and despite persistent efforts by the U.S. Central Authority to prompt Mexican authorities to address these cases, numerous parents have waited for years with no contact or information about the whereabouts of their children. Of the return <b>applications</b> <b>submitted</b> to the Mexican Central Authority that remained unresolved after eighteen months or longer, approximately half remain in limbo because Mexican authorities have not located the children. As a practical matter, the left-behind parent or someone working on his/her behalf must develop most leads pertaining to the possible location of abducted children {{without the help of}} Mexican authorities. In some cases, Mexican authorities profess an {{inability to}} find children even when the family or the U.S. Embassy has shared concrete information with the Mexican Central Authority on the child's whereabouts.|$|E

2500|$|Legal {{action against}} the park {{by a group of}} seven Milsons Point {{residents}} and one developer began again in April 2005. The claim was of noise nuisance from the amusement rides, particularly those in Maloney's Corner. The case was defeated when legislation was passed by the New South Wales government protecting Luna Park from such claims, although it was later revealed that these laws may have been influenced by court documents leaked to then-Tourism, Sport, and Recreation minister Sandra Nori by two Luna Park executives. The executives were charged with contempt of court in August 2007. A new case began in June 2007, with the residents instead claiming breaches of the Trade Practices Act. Stating that they had been misled as to the types of amusement ride that were located in the Maloney's Corner area, the residents and developer attempted to claim over $20 million in damages, and demanded the relocation or permanent closure of the Ranger and Spider rides. The case was dismissed by the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 6 February 2009, with the supervising Justice ruling that the development <b>applications</b> <b>submitted</b> by the park had not been [...] "misleading or deceptive", as claimed.|$|E
