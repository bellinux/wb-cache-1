500|$|Harrison Ford reprises {{the role}} of Dr. Henry [...] "Indiana" [...] Jones, Jr. To prepare for the role, the 64-year-old Ford spent {{three hours a day}} at a gym, practiced with the bullwhip for two weeks, and relied on a high-protein diet of fish and vegetables. Ford had kept fit during the series' hiatus anyway, as he hoped for another film. He {{performed}} many of his own stunts because stunt technology had become safer since 1989, and he also felt it improved his performance. It is also said that he still fit into his pants from Raiders of the Lost Ark. He argued, [...] "The appeal of Indiana Jones isn't his youth but his imagination, his resourcefulness. His physicality is <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> especially the way he gets out of tight situations. But it's not all hitting people and falling from high places. My ambition in action is to have the audience look straight in the face of character and not at the back of a capable stuntman's head. I hope to continue that no matter how old I get." [...] Ford felt his return would reduce U.S. ageism (he refused to dye his hair for the role), because of the film's family appeal: [...] "This is a movie which is geared not to [...] segment of the demographic, an age-defined segment ... We've got a great shot at breaking the movie demographic constraints." [...] He told Koepp to add more references to his age in the script. Spielberg said Ford was not too old to play Indiana: [...] "When a guy gets to be that age and he still packs the same punch, and he still runs just as fast and climbs just as high, he's gonna be breathing a little heavier {{at the end of the}} set piece. And I felt, 'Let's have some fun with that. Let's not hide that. Spielberg recalled the line in Raiders that said, [...] "It's not the years, it's the mileage," [...] and felt he could not tell the difference between Ford during the shoots for Last Crusade and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.|$|E

50|$|Shortly before, {{and during}} the Progressive Era, better {{organization}} of various fields of work including engineering took place because it encouraged professionalism, equality, and progress.

Professional codes of ethics were also established for this profession. However, the growing profession of engineering had still difficulty in organizing itself.|$|E

5000|$|A {{common theme}} amongst the {{criticism}} was the [...] "lack of common sense", as wrestling journalist, Ben Miller, put it. He made particular mention to the World title match, by saying, [...] "...there {{was no reason}} for Jarrett, Angle or Foley to attempt to beat Sting. You can win a championship, control of the company, leadership of a powerful faction or... what? If you end Sting’s career do you become six-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion. There is, of course, the argument that by pinning Sting you eliminate a potential rival. I don’t think the crowd bought that argument. The heat was spotty during the match and the lack of a sensible reason for attacking Sting appeared to be <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> TNA Sacrifice 2009 felt flat, but it shouldn’t have. Most everyone worked hard, some angles paid off and some angles left fans intrigued. Those three ingredients usually make for a good show. Instead, one-third of the matches had conceptual problems...".|$|E

It's not that they’re {{embarrassing}} to me, it's because I wanted them to remain intimate with those people who were there when we slept on their floors. We were putting out 500 seven-inches even though people sell them on eBay for more than I had to put them out with. I still prefer it that way. I like that culture; I’m part of that culture. I didn’t want everything homogenized into one album. I'm not a big fan of [...] "greatest hits" [...] or whatever, but I understand that's part of what labels do.

Some of the typical crops grown are wheat, barley, rye, oats and corn.|$|E
5000|$|Kenneth Bianchi, {{one of the}} [...] "Hillside Stranglers", murdered {{women and}} girls of {{different}} ages, races and appearance because his sexual urges required different types of stimulation and increasing intensity. Jeffrey Dahmer, who was repeatedly diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, searched for his perfect fantasy lover—beautiful, submissive and eternal. As his desire increased, he experimented with drugs, alcohol, and exotic sex. His increasing need for stimulation was demonstrated by the dismemberment of victims, whose heads and genitals he preserved, and by his attempts to create a [...] "living zombie" [...] under his control (by pouring acid into a hole drilled into the victim's skull). Dahmer once said, [...] "Lust played <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Control and lust. Once it happened the first time, {{it just seemed like}} it had control of my life from there on in. The killing was just a means to an end. That was the least satisfactory part. I didn't enjoy doing that. That's why I tried to create living zombies with … acid and the drill." [...] He further elaborated on this, also saying, [...] "I wanted {{to see if it was}} possible to make—again, it sounds really gross—uh, zombies, people that would not have a will of their own, but would follow my instructions without resistance. So after that, I started using the drilling technique." [...] He experimented with cannibalism to [...] "ensure his victims would always be a part of him".|$|E
