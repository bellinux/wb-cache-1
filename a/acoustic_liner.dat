40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of direct drag measurements on a variety of porous plate <b>acoustic</b> <b>liners.</b> The existing literature describes numerous studies of drag on porous walls with injection or suction, but relatively few of drag on porous plates with neither injection nor suction. Furthermore, the porosity of the porous plate in existing studies is much lower than typically used in <b>acoustic</b> <b>liners.</b> In the present work, the <b>acoustic</b> <b>liners</b> consisted of a perforated face sheet covering a bulk acoustic absorber material. Factors that were varied in the experiment were hole diameter, hole pattern, face sheet thickness, bulk material type, and size of the gap (if any) between the face sheet and the absorber material...|$|R

The <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner</b> may include a straight cell section including {{a plurality of}} cells with straight chambers. The <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner</b> may also include a bent cell section including one or more cells that are bent to extend chamber length without increasing the overall height of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner</b> by the entire chamber length. In some cases, holes are placed between cell chambers in addition to bending the cells, or instead of bending the cells...|$|E
40|$|While liners {{have been}} {{utilized}} throughout turbofan ducts to attenuate fan noise, additional attenuation is obtainable by placing an <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner</b> over-the-rotor. Previous experiments have shown significant fan performance losses when acoustic liners are installed over-the-rotor. The fan blades induce an oscillating {{flow in the}} acoustic liners which results in a performance loss near the blade tip. An over-the-rotor liner was designed with circumferential grooves between the fan blade tips and the <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner</b> to reduce the oscillating flow in the <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner.</b> An experiment was conducted in the W- 8 Single-Stage Axial Compressor Facility at NASA Glenn Research Center on a 1. 5 pressure ratio fan to evaluate {{the impact of this}} over-the-rotor treatment design on fan aerodynamic performance. The addition of a circumferentially grooved over-the-rotor design between the fan blades and the <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner</b> reduced the performance loss, in terms of fan adiabatic efficiency, to less than 1 % which is within the repeatability of this experiment...|$|E

The <b>acoustic</b> <b>liners</b> may be positioned {{at the ends}} of flaps of an aircraft wing to provide broadband noise absorption and/or dampen the noise producing unsteady flow features, and {{to reduce the amount of}} noise generated due to unsteady flow at the inboard and/or outboard end edges of a flap...|$|R
40|$|Combustor or {{afterburner}} instabilities such as {{buzz and}} screech modes {{can lead to}} major damage in gas turbines. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>liners</b> may be very effective for damping screech modes, but are also challenging to model in CFD/CAA analysis. A new time-domain porous wall sub-model is presented which enables the inclusion of <b>acoustic</b> <b>liners</b> in unsteady compressible flow solvers. The model includes linear and non-linear loss as well as inertial effects, thereby yielding the correct frequency depen-dent damping. Validation of the model {{has been carried out}} for standard Helmholtz type <b>acoustic</b> <b>liners</b> with zero grazing flow. Numerical studies have also been performed for an afterburner test case, with the aim of optimizing a possible screech liner. These studies include unsteady RANS com-putations and Arnoldi eigenmode extraction based on an LNSE solver...|$|R
30|$|The {{acoustic}} damping in {{gas turbines}} and aero-engines relies {{to a great}} extent on <b>acoustic</b> <b>liners</b> that consists of a cavity and a perforated face sheet. The prediction of the impedance of the liners by direct numerical simulation is nowadays not feasible due to the hundreds to thousands repetitions of tiny holes. We introduce a procedure to numerically obtain the Rayleigh conductivity for <b>acoustic</b> <b>liners</b> for viscous gases at rest, and with it define the acoustic impedance of the perforated sheet.|$|R

40|$|The {{acoustic}} field produced by broadband noise sources around the slat of a high-lift wing model is predicted using a hybrid method {{based on a}} large eddy simulation of the compressible flow for the noise generation and acoustic perturbation equation calculations for the acoustic propagation. The potential for noise attenuation using acoustic liners within the slat gap region of the high-lift wing is investigated by solving the acoustic perturbation equations with a broadband time-domain impedance boundary condition, and the <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner</b> conditions are applied on the slat cove surface and the main element. Results show that attenuation of the broadband noise is obtained with the <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner</b> treatment in the slat gap region...|$|E
40|$|Simulation-based {{optimization}} of <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner</b> {{design in}} a turbofan engine nacelle for noise reduction purposes can dramatically {{reduce the cost}} and time needed for experimental designs. Because uncertainties are inevitable in the design process, a stochastic optimization algorithm is posed based on the conditional value-at-risk measure so that an ideal <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner</b> impedance is determined that is robust {{in the presence of}} uncertainties. A parallel reduced-order modeling framework is developed that dramatically improves the computational efficiency of the stochastic optimization solver for a realistic nacelle geometry. The reduced stochastic optimization solver takes less than 500 seconds to execute. In addition, well-posedness and finite element error analyses of the state system and optimization problem are provided...|$|E
50|$|Aircraft engines, {{typically}} turbofans, use <b>acoustic</b> <b>liners</b> to damp engine noise. Liners {{are applied}} {{on the internal}} walls of the engine nacelle, both in the intake and by-pass ducts, and use Helmholtz resonance principle for the dissipation of incident acoustic energy.|$|R
40|$|With the {{increase}} in air travels the last decades the number of airplanes have increased dramatically. The sound generated by the engines have become a significant problem. The last 60 years {{a lot has been}} made trying to reduce the noise levels. Modern jet-engines generates a combination of broadband random noise and tonal components. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>liners</b> are commonly used sound attenuators in jet-engines. Research has shown that <b>acoustic</b> <b>liners</b> can behave both linearly and nonlinearly depending on the sound pressure level. Many studies on the nonlinear effects of <b>acoustic</b> <b>liners</b> have been made and in this report the effect of high level broadband excitation in combination with tonal excitation is evaluated. If nonlinear effect occur it can be of importance for future construction of sound attenuators for jet-engines. The result from this study indicates that at high levels of excitation there is a nonlinear relationship between the random excitation and the tonal excitation. High levels of tonal excitation can increase the level of the random excitation over the full frequency range. For high levels of random excitation the level at the excited tone decreased. Even random excitation at lower frequencies than of the tone can have an effect at the tonal frequency...|$|R
50|$|All modern {{turbofan}} {{engines are}} equipped with <b>acoustic</b> <b>liners</b> to damp the noise generated. These are installed in the nacelle, and they extend {{as much as possible}} to cover the largest area.

40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulations (DNS) of turbulent pipe flows {{are carried}} out to investigate the suppression of previously-identified internal noise sources with an <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner</b> using a time-domain <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner</b> model developed by Tam and Auriault (AIAA Journal, 34 (5), 917 - 923, 1996). The liner model is implemented and tested in an in-house DNS code. Validation tests are conducted to show its correct implementation in the DNS solver. In order to study the liner model capability a number of tests {{are carried out}} with different liner parameters and flow Mach Numbers. To understand {{the effect of the}} liner on the acoustic and turbulent components of the unsteady wall pressure, an azimuthal/axial Fourier transform is applied and the acoustic and turbulent wavenumber regimes are clearly identified. It is found that the spectral component occupying the turbulent wavenumber range is unaffected by the liner, whereas the acoustic wavenumber components are strongly attenuated, with individual radial modes evident as each cuts on with increasing Strouhal number. The acoustic wavenumber analysis shows that the acoustic component of the wall pressure prevails over the hydrodynamic wall pressure. This allows the <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner</b> model to dissipate the acoustic field only, leaving the hydrodynamic component statistically unchanged. Furthermore, a DNS of a pipe/jet configuration is computed to study the effects of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner</b> model on the far-field noise. Noise prediction is performed using the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FWH) method. The FWH method has also been tested to identify the best configuration of the FWH surface. A conical-shaped surface proved to be a better surface. Furthermore, results show far-field noise reduction when the liner model is present...|$|E

40|$|The present work {{explored}} {{the feasibility of}} controlling the acoustic impedance of a resonant type <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner.</b> This was accomplished by translating one perforate over another of the same porosity creating a totally new perforate that had an intermediate porosity. This type of adjustable perforate created a variable orifice perforate whose orifices were non-circular. The key objective {{of the present study}} was to quantify, the degree of attenuation control that can be achieved by applying such a concept to the buried septum in a two-degree-of-freedom (2 DOF) <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner.</b> An additional objective was to examine the adequacy of the existing impedance models to explain the behavior of the unique orifice shapes that result from the proposed silding perforate concept. Different orifice shapes with equivalent area were also examined to determine if highly non-circular orifices had a significant impact on the impedance...|$|E
40|$|Four {{samples of}} natural reeds, Phragmites australis, {{were tested in}} the NASA Langley and Glenn Normal Incidence Impedance Tubes in order to {{experimentally}} determine the acoustic absorption coefficients {{as a function of}} frequency from 400 to 3000 Hz. Six samples that mimicked the geometry of the assemblies of natural reeds were also designed and additively manufactured from ASA thermoplastic and tested. Results indicate that structures can be manufactured of synthetic materials that mimic the geometry and the low frequency acoustic absorption of natural reeds. This accomplishment demonstrates that a new class of structures can now be considered {{for a wide range of}} industrial products that need thin, lightweight, broadband acoustic absorption effective at frequencies below 1000 Hz. Aircraft engine <b>acoustic</b> <b>liners</b> and aircraft cabin <b>acoustic</b> <b>liners,</b> in particular, are two aviation applications that might benefit from further development of this concept...|$|R

40|$|Bias {{acoustic}} liners {{have been}} investigated {{by a number of}} researchers and demonstrated to have acoustic benefits. However while research has concentrated on the acoustic aspects of the liner, little research has directly investigated its heat transfer properties. A three dimensional numerical investigation of the fluid flow and heat transfer properties of a single honeycomb cell was carried out in order to develop an understanding of the flow and heat transfer properties of the bias <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner.</b> Experimental measurements of fluid flow and heat transfer properties of an <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner</b> sample were also carried out in order to validate the numerical solution. The experimental results were found to give lower values of heat transfer coefficient at low flow rates when compared with the numerical solution. The numerical solution for pressure loss agreed with Kutscher’s findings. The experimental results agreed with the traditional expression for pressure loss across abrupt expansions...|$|E

40|$|Stricter noise {{regulations}} for commercial aircraft have {{increased interest in}} noise reduction techniques within the aerospace industry. To meet the requirements new noise suppression technologies have to be delveoped and the numerical methods need to be validated and possibly improved for the correct assessment of these new technologies. This thesis deals with numerical predictions of flow and far-field acoustic signature for mixer-ejector nozzle configurations including acoustic liners. The flow field predictions are obtained using large eddy simulation and Kirchhoff's surface integration technique is used for predicting the far-field noise. A time-domain broadband impedance boundary condition formulation is used for modeling a Helmholts type <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner.</b> In all cases studied, the nozzle geometry {{is included in the}} calculation domain. For the mixer-ejector nozzle configuration the flow field is well captured and the target mass flows were obtained indicating that the prediction was successful.

In validations against experimental benchmark test cases the model has given very good agreement in cases with both stagnant conditions and grazing flow...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 89 - 94 Centrifugal {{compressors}} used in {{the pipeline}} market generate very strong noise, which is typically dominated by the blade passing frequency and its higher harmonics. The high level of noise is not only very disturbing to the people living close to the installation site but can also potentially cause structural failures in the piping. A novel design of an acoustic Helmholtz array (AHA) has been developed to address this type of noise problem. Computational {{studies show that the}} installation of the AHA liner on the compressor diffuser walls is very effective in reducing the noise level of the compressor, especially the dominant blade passing frequency noise. The <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner</b> design has actually been built and tested. The data clearly show that the use of acoustic liners is indeed very effective in the reduction of compressor tonal noise. This effort compares the noise levels of a pipeline compressor with and without the <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner</b> of Helmholtz resonator arrays and quantifies the effectiveness of the liner in terms of decibel reduction.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} effects of liner length and {{attenuation}} on the CHE (convected Helmholtz equation) impedance eduction method, in which the surface impedance of an <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner</b> is inferred through an iterative process based on repeated solutions to the convected Helmholtz equation. Wire mesh-over-honeycomb and perforate-over-honeycomb acoustic liners are tested in the NASA Langley Grazing Flow Impedance Tube, and the resultant data are processed using two impedance eduction methods. The first is the CHE method, {{and the second is}} a direct method (labeled the KT method) that uses the Kumaresan and Tufts algorithm to compute the impedance directly. The CHE method has been extensively used for <b>acoustic</b> <b>liner</b> evaluation, but experiences anomalous behavior under some test conditions. It is postulated that the anomalies are related to the liner length and/or attenuation. Since the KT method only employs data measured over the length of the liner, it is expected to be unaffected by liner length. A comparison of results achieved with the two impedance eduction methods is used to explore the interactive effects of liner length and attenuation on the CHE impedance eduction method...|$|E
