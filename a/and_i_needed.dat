25|$|I didn't {{have much}} time. July was half through, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> {{to get a}} new forty-odd-person team assembled, trained, and {{deployed}} prior to Butler's arrival in Iraq on August 2. We would use the same basic inspection concept that had been prepared for July; the intelligence on both sites, I was assured by sources, was still valid but not for much longer. I would make use of some twenty-five inspectors resident in Baghdad with the monitoring groups, and I added twelve experts, {{selected on the basis of}} what the team needed for the planned inspection. I had a five-person command element fly to Bahrain with the twelve experts to train them. They were to stay in Bahrain after the training to carry out last-minute preparations and receive intelligence updates until they flew into Iraq on the same plane that would take Butler out on August 5. Somehow it all came together. The inspections would begin on the morning of the 6th.|$|E

In the 2010 documentary on the band, No Distance Left to Run, Coxon stated that he was getting more influenced by American guitarists as [...] "a lot of them were doing very interesting stuff with guitars <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> to be nourished. I suppose as a guitar player and there was none of that happening in English music although English music was now more popular [...] I started listening to more stuff from the States from smaller labels." ...|$|E

Margarita said about it: [...] "It was a very solid and romantic story. I never stopped loving him but one day it didn't seem right any more, it was politics, politics, politics, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> nurturing." [...] An unnamed friend of those years is quoted by Paul Routledge in his biography of Brown as recalling: [...] "She was sweet and gentle and obviously cut out to make somebody a very good wife. She was bright, too, though not like him, but they seemed made for each other." ...|$|E

Her auditions for both Bollywood and Hollywood productions, including {{for the role of}} Bond girl Camille Montes in Marc Forster's Quantum of Solace (2008), were largely unsuccessful.

500|$|Described by her biographer Wes Gehring as [...] "a free-spirited tomboy", {{the young}} Lombard was passionately {{involved}} {{in sports and}} enjoyed watching movies. At Virgil Junior High School, she participated in tennis, volleyball, and swimming, and won trophies for her achievements in athletics. At the age of 12, this hobby unexpectedly landed Lombard her first screen role.

[...] With the encouragement of her mother, Lombard happily took a small role in the melodrama A Perfect Crime (1921). She was on set for two days, playing the sister of Monte Blue.

500|$|Bridges re-joined Conference National side Kettering Town on 1 August 2011, {{signing a}} two-year {{deal with the}} club. He joined Kettering on a free transfer, having been out of {{contract}} at Stevenage — [...] "I got injured at {{the back end of}} last season and I was out of contract and because of all the deals that needed to be sorted at Stevenage, I wasn't a priority and I had to wait. There comes a time when you can't wait any longer <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> to sort my future out so here we are". Bridges made his Kettering Town debut in a 2–0 away win at Lincoln City on 10 September 2011, the club's first away victory of the season. After making just five appearances for Kettering, Bridges was transfer-listed by new manager Mark Stimson on 29 September. Despite being transfer-listed due to Kettering's financial problems, Bridges continued to play in the first-team, and he scored his first goal for the club in a 2–2 draw against Ebbsfleet United, scoring from close range to give the club an initial one-goal lead. Bridges scored once again in a 2–1 home defeat to Grimsby Town on 26 November 2011, scoring in injury-time to half the deficit. Bridges was forced to take training following the departure of Stimson, with only six other Kettering players turning up to train due to unpaid wages. Despite the off-field problems, he remained ever-present {{for the remainder of the}} season, playing 38 times in all competitions, and scoring his third and final goal of the campaign in a 1–1 home draw with Barrow in April 2012. Kettering were relegated, finishing bottom of the league, and faced a further relegation due to entering a Company Voluntary Arrangement. Bridges had one year remaining on his contract at Kettering, but left in July 2012, calling the campaign the [...] "worst of his career".|$|E

2500|$|Liam Neeson as Peyton Westlake / Darkman, a {{brilliant}} scientist who was {{left for dead}} and burned alive as he returns to seek revenge on those who made him what he is. Originally, Raimi's longtime friend and collaborator Bruce Campbell was set to play Darkman, but the studio balked at the idea {{because they did not}} think Campbell could carry the role. Gary Oldman and Bill Paxton were also considered before Liam Neeson was cast. For the role, Raimi was looking for someone who could suggest [...] "a monster with the soul of a man, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> an actor who could do that beneath a lot of makeup" [...] and liked Neeson's [...] "old Gary Cooper charisma." [...] The actor was drawn to the operatic nature of the story and the inner turmoil of his character. To research for the role, Neeson contacted the Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors, an organization that supports the emotional and social healing of burn survivors.|$|E

2500|$|Caputo {{worked as}} the {{campaign}} manager for Carl Paladino in his 2010 bid for Governor of New York. Caputo was profiled in a subject piece about him during the campaign in The New York Times; the paper said of his campaign strategy: [...] "Michael R. Caputo's impish spirit and no-holds-barred campaign style have helped propel his boss, Carl P. Paladino, a relatively unknown real estate mogul from Buffalo, to the Republican nomination for New York governor". Paladino was supported at the time by the Tea Party movement, and {{in an interview with}} The New York Times, his campaign manager embraced the outsider nature of their bid in the 2010 New York gubernatorial election: [...] "This is a campaign of junkyard dogs, not pedigreed poodles. Carl knows the background of everyone who works for him. He knows that each of us comes to the campaign with warts. And he has his own warts. We don't hide anything." [...] Paladino explained his hiring choice of Caputo as campaign manager to The New York Times: [...] "I'm facing some major demons here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> someone who could go right back on top of them in a matter of minutes.

That's what he did. It's raw, dangerous and big. That's what I {{want to be on}} stage. It's a different energy to Lady Gaga. The music is more rock, funk and soul inspired." [...] Killer Love sees Scherzinger duet with two male vocalists. On the ballad, [...] "Power's Out", she duets with English recording artist Sting. Speaking of their collaboration, which took place with both singers in the same studio, Scherzinger said [...] " [...] energy is very commanding, in a subtle way. He is giving, generous and kind. I flew to Boston for his show with The Police. I met him and he was everything and more than I thought. I felt like we were doing yoga when we were singing. He was such an easy guy to work with... Singing on the same mic you are really close. He had fresh breath. No broccoli in the teeth." [...] David Renshaw from PopDash said the song borrowed elements and the sound from The Police, a band Sting was previously lead singer of, and in particular their 1983 hit single [...] "Every Breath You Take". The other duet is with Enrique Iglesias, on his 2010 single [...] "Heartbeat". The version featured on Killer Love is the [...] "Rude Well's Open Heart Remix".
