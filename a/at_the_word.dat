5|$|These symbols {{describe}} {{the features of}} a language above the level of individual consonants and vowels, such as prosody, tone, length, and stress, which often operate on syllables, words, or phrases: that is, elements such as the intensity, pitch, and gemination of {{the sounds of a}} language, as well as the rhythm and intonation of speech. Although most of these symbols indicate distinctions that are phonemic <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> level, symbols also exist for intonation on a level greater than that of the word. Various ligatures of tone letters are used in the IPA Handbook despite not being found on the simplified official IPA chart.|$|E

25|$|The {{first major}} area in {{semantic}} analysis is {{the identification of}} the intended meaning <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> level (taken to include idiomatic expressions). This is word-sense disambiguation (a concept that is evolving away from the notion that words have discrete senses, but rather are characterized by {{the ways in which they}} are used, i.e., their contexts). The tasks in this area include lexical sample and all-word disambiguation, multi- and cross-lingual disambiguation, and lexical substitution. Given the difficulties of identifying word senses, other tasks relevant to this topic include word-sense induction, subcategorization acquisition, and evaluation of lexical resources.|$|E

500|$|The {{stone was}} raised by Vésteinn in memory of his brother Freysteinn who died in Greece, and {{according}} to Omeljan Pritsak, Freysteinn was the commander of a retinue. The wolf-beast image {{in the center of}} Sö 82 touches the inscription at the name Freysteinn and has its jaws <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> for [...] "was dead" [...] or [...] "died." [...] Since one known kenning in Old Norse poetry for being killed in battle was that the [...] "wolf was fed," [...] the combination of the text and imagery would lead to the conclusion that Freysteinn had died in battle in Greece.|$|E
500|$|It is debated by some whether Bringing Up Baby is {{the first}} fictional work (apart from pornography) {{to use the word}} gay in a {{homosexual}} context. In one scene, Cary Grant's character is wearing a woman's marabou-trimmed négligée; when asked why, he replies exasperatedly [...] "Because I just went gay all of a sudden!" [...] (leaping into the air <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> gay). As the term gay did not become familiar to the general public until the Stonewall riots in 1969, it is debated whether the word was used here in its original sense (meaning [...] "happy") or is an intentional, joking reference to homosexuality.|$|E
500|$|Caligari was a {{critical}} success in France, but French filmmakers were divided in their opinions after its release. Abel Gance called it [...] "superb" [...] and wrote, [...] "What a lesson to all directors!" [...] and René Clair said [...] "overthrew the realist dogma" [...] of filmmaking. Film critic and director Louis Delluc said the film has a compelling rhythm: [...] "At first slow, deliberately laborious, it attempts to irritate. Then when the zigzag motifs of the fairground start turning, the pace leaps forward, agitato, accelerando, and leaves off only <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'End', as abruptly as {{a slap in the}} face." [...] Jean Epstein, however, called it [...] "a prize example of the abuse of décor in the cinema" [...] and said it [...] "represents a grave sickness of cinema". Likewise, Jean Cocteau called it [...] "the first step towards a grave error which consists of flat photography of eccentric decors, instead of obtaining surprise by means of the camera". [...] French critic Frédéric-Philippe Amiguet wrote of the film: [...] "It has the odor of tainted food. It leaves a taste of cinders in the mouth." [...] The Russian director Sergei Eisenstein especially disliked Caligari, calling it a [...] "combination of silent hysteria, partially coloured canvases, daubed flats, painted faces, and the unnatural broken gestures and action of monstrous chimaeras".|$|E

2500|$|Haredi is a Modern Hebrew {{adjective}} {{derived from}} the Biblical verb hared which appears in the Book of Isaiah ( [...] ; its plural haredim appears in Isaiah [...] ) and is translated as [...] " [...] trembles" [...] <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> of God. The word connotes an awe-inspired fear and anxiety to perform the will of God, and is used to describe staunchly Orthodox Jews (similar to the definition used by the Christian Quakers) and to distinguish them from other Orthodox Jews.|$|E

2500|$|The {{advertisement}} {{has also}} been banned by regulators in Canada, owing to the implication of [...] "unbranded alcohol consumption" [...] by the opening line, [...] "We've poured you a beer".

2500|$|In popular speech, the {{fricative}} [...] has {{a tendency}} to become 'aspirated' before another consonant (the resulting sound depending on what the consonant is, although stating it is a voiceless glottal fricative, , would give a clear idea of the mechanism) or simply in all syllable-final positions in less educated speech [...] This change may be realized only <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> level or it may also cross word boundaries. That is, esto es lo mismo [...] "this is the same" [...] is pronounced something like , but in las águilas azules [...] "the blue eagles", [...] in las and águilas might remain [...] as no consonant follows: , or become the pronunciation is largely an individual choice.|$|E

[...] From there they, {{along with the other}} regiments of the 1st and 2nd Divisions, marched up 6th Street, turned onto 7th Street and on to the [...] "7th Street Road".
