30|$|The {{amount of}} cesium {{adsorption}} by 8 WE-MC decreased {{was less than}} that of 4 WE-MC, despite the similarity in the pH of the sample solutions. In addition, the total elution of metal ions from 8 WE-MC was unlikely to be greater than that from 4 WE-MC. Therefore, these results suggest that factors other than pH and the level of metal ions control cesium-adsorption ability. One factor is likely to be <b>acidic</b> <b>substances,</b> which are produced during the manufacturing process, and have the ability to capture cesium ions. No noticeable differences were observed between IR-PA spectrum of MC and those of 8 WE-MC and 12 WE-MC. However, the decreases in cesium adsorption by 8 WE-MC and 12 WE-MC were due probably to the removal of the <b>acidic</b> <b>substances</b> that have the functional groups being able to capture cesium ions, such as carboxylic or phenolic hydroxyl groups from MC by the extraction treatments.|$|R
30|$|Conventional {{water retting}} of jute is {{characterized}} by high water consumption, heavy pollution, and long degumming time (Haque et al. 2002), whereas chemical semi-degumming of jute is disadvantageous in terms of heavy pollution and severe fiber damages (Ahmed and Akhter 2001). However, the bio-degumming of jute does not require strong acid and strong base and {{is characterized by}} gentle degumming technological conditions, high efficiency, high quality, and low pollution. In contrast with the ribbon retting of jute (Banik et al. 2003), during jute degumming process of bacterial strain DCE- 01, within 12  h, pH is kept acidic while ORP kept being greater than 0 namely under aerobic status, at 15  h, pH presented alkaline status while ORP was negative namely under anaerobic status.

It can also tunnel beneath its current cave network, make a space underneath the opposer, and then dissolve its cover to attack from beneath.|$|E

Bitter and <b>acidic</b> <b>substances</b> elicited an increase in mRNA accumulation of the immediate-early response gene egr- 1, as revealed by in situ hybridization. Conversely, chemostimulants that did not induce aversion did not induce egr- 1 response. Maximum labelling was observed in cells located in the oropharyngeal cavity and on the gill rakers. Gustatory {{areas of the brain}} were also labelled. Interestingly, when bitter tastants were repeatedly associated with food reward, zebrafish juveniles learned to ingest food {{in the presence of the}} bitter compound. After habituation, the acquisition of acceptance for bitterness was accompanied by a loss of egr- 1 labelling. Altogether, our data indicate that egr- 1 participates specifically in food aversion. The existence of reward-coupled changes in taste sensitivity in humans suggests that our results are relevant to situations in humans...|$|R

5000|$|Mizithra is {{made from}} raw, whole ewe's or goat's milk in the {{simplest}} way possible: milk is brought to a slow boil {{for a few minutes}} and then curdled by adding rennet or whey from a previous batch (see below) or else some <b>acidic</b> <b>substance</b> such as lemon juice, vinegar or even a fresh broken fig tree sprig. As soon as curds have formed they are poured into a cheesecloth bag and hung to drain. The whey dripping out of the bag can be used to curdle the next batch of mizithra. After a few days mizithra forms a sweet, moist, soft mass molded in the shape of the hanging bag with a rounded bottom and a conical, wrinkly top. At this stage it is called [...] "sweet" [...] or [...] "fresh mizithra" [...] and may be eaten or, often, baked in pies.|$|E
50|$|Curds are a {{dairy product}} {{obtained}} by coagulating {{milk in a}} process called curdling. The coagulation {{can be caused by}} adding rennet or any edible <b>acidic</b> <b>substance</b> such as lemon juice or vinegar, and then allowing it to sit. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins (casein) to tangle into solid masses, or curds. Milk that has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria) will also naturally produce curds, and sour milk cheeses are produced this way. Producing cheese curds {{is one of the first}} steps in cheesemaking; the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents (molds for blue cheeses, etc.) are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese. The remaining liquid, which contains only whey proteins, is the whey. In cow's milk, 80 percent of the proteins are caseins.|$|E

30|$|The {{adhesion}} {{process of}} the tooth substrates is a complex mechanism which involves the demineralization of the surface, micro-porosities formation, resin monomers infiltration, and a proper polymerization. Several factors may hamper {{one or more of}} these factors, such as the <b>acidic</b> <b>substance</b> concentration used for etching the substrate [23], the polarity of the adhesive substances applied over the demineralized tooth [24, 25], the complete or incomplete volatilization of any solvent retained in the adhesive layer [26], or the light source and intensity used for photo-activate the adhesive [12]. Considering each of these aforementioned factors, the <b>acidic</b> <b>substance</b> used for the experimental materials formulation was the HEMA-P, which has demonstrated satisfactory demineralization ability in a previous study; [11] after the primer’s application, the solvent was volatilized by air stream for 10 s, leading to the formation of a shiny layer over the substrate (a solvent-free pellicle was visually formed); lastly, the light source used was the same for all the materials evaluated. Nevertheless, the polarity of each resin blend formulated is unknown, and this fact may have probably caused the different bond strength results obtained in the study.|$|E
