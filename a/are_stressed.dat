5|$|IRIS {{featured}} {{an ensemble}} cast split between characters of North Korean and South Korean descent. Because the series explores {{the tension and}} mentality behind {{the two sides of}} the conflict, both the North and South perspectives are shown at length. The plot focuses on the cast overcoming the manipulation they face at an international level and occasionally attempting to reconcile their differences to fight an evil greater than either side ever acknowledged, making way for scenarios in which their allegiances <b>are</b> <b>stressed</b> and put to the test.|$|E
5|$|Khmer {{differs from}} {{neighboring}} languages such as Thai, Burmese, Lao and Vietnamese {{in that it}} is not a tonal language. Words <b>are</b> <b>stressed</b> on the final syllable, hence many words conform to the typical Mon–Khmer pattern of a stressed syllable preceded by a minor syllable. The language has been written in the Khmer script, an abugida descended from the Brahmi script via the southern Indian Pallava script, since at least the seventh century. The script's form and use has evolved over the centuries; its modern features include subscripted versions of consonants used to write clusters and a division of consonants into two series with different inherent vowels. Approximately 79% of Cambodians are able to read Khmer.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{the most}} {{extensive}} collection of phonetic data so far in Mongolian studies {{has been applied to}} a partial account of stress placement in the closely related Chakhar dialect. The conclusion is drawn that di- and trisyllabic words with a short first syllable <b>are</b> <b>stressed</b> on the second syllable. But if their first syllable is long, then the data for different acoustic parameters seems to support conflicting conclusions: intensity data often seems to indicate that the first syllable is stressed, while F0 seems to indicate that it is the second syllable that is stressed.|$|E

50|$|Huenergard (2005:3-4) {{claims that}} <b>stress</b> in Akkadian <b>is</b> {{completely}} predictable. In his syllable typology {{there are three}} syllable weights: light (V, CV); heavy (CVC, CV̄, CV̂), and superheavy (CV̂C). If the last syllable is superheavy, it <b>is</b> <b>stressed,</b> otherwise the rightmost heavy syllable <b>is</b> <b>stressed.</b> If a word contains only light syllables, the first syllable <b>is</b> <b>stressed.</b>|$|R
5|$|Stress {{plays an}} {{important}} role in English. Certain syllables <b>are</b> <b>stressed,</b> while others are unstressed. Stress is a combination of duration, intensity, vowel quality, and sometimes changes in pitch. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables, and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently reduced while vowels in stressed syllables are not. Some words, primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as can, have weak and strong forms depending on whether they occur in stressed or non-stressed position within a sentence.|$|E
5|$|The next day, many {{survivors}} in the island's camp <b>are</b> <b>stressed,</b> including Sullivan (Scott Paulin), who is diagnosed with hives by Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox). John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) {{and his new}} hunting companion, Ethan Rom (William Mapother), give some newly found luggage to Hurley; he looks through it and finds golf clubs. The next morning, Hurley builds a golf course to improve morale amongst the survivors. Jack, Charlie, and Michael decide to join him, and eventually around twenty people, including Kate and Sawyer, arrive to participate.|$|E
5|$|In Quenya, the {{stressing}} of a syllable is {{predictable and}} non-phonemic (i.e. {{the meaning of}} a word never changes depending on the stress), but it is partly determined by syllable weight. Words of two syllables <b>are</b> <b>stressed</b> on the first syllable. In words of three or more syllables, the stress is on the penultimate syllable if this is heavy, otherwise on the antepenultimate syllable, i.e. the third-to-last syllable. In Quenya, heavy syllables are syllables that contain either a long vowel, a diphthong, or a cluster of two consonants (ll, ld, mm, ss, etc.). Certain combinations of consonants, e.g. ny, ry, are also regarded as heavy. Medially hy and hw are long consonants in Parmaquesta (not colloquially in Tarquesta) and a vowel before them is held to constitute a metrically long syllable. Quenya has also a secondary accent. The placement of stress and the distinction between heavy and light syllables is important in Quenya verse.|$|E
50|$|The infinitive form umfahren is only {{identical}} in its written form. When spoken, the non-separable form <b>is</b> <b>stressed</b> as umfahren, whereas the separable <b>is</b> <b>stressed</b> as umfahren.|$|R
50|$|Word stress bears {{a strong}} {{relationship}} to vowel length. A final vowel, long or short, may not <b>be</b> <b>stressed,</b> though {{one of the last}} three syllables may <b>be</b> <b>stressed.</b> As such, the last heavy syllable (containing a long vowel or ending in a consonant) <b>is</b> <b>stressed.</b> Gemination occurs in the language, as heard in words like lebbaa ("heart") and shmayya ("sky").|$|R
5000|$|Where {{there are}} more than two vowels, the first vowel <b>is</b> <b>stressed</b> if it <b>is</b> long or it is {{directly}} followed by two consonants. Otherwise, the second vowel <b>is</b> <b>stressed.</b>|$|R
5|$|Michael decides {{the workers}} <b>are</b> <b>stressed</b> {{because they are}} {{reluctant}} to express their feelings, so he organizes a comedic roast of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each {{of the office and}} warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes time for him to roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to feel bad about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. Stanley laughs heartily when Michael roasts him, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.|$|E
5|$|Newborns {{have black}} natal coats and bright pink skin. Females {{are the primary}} {{caregivers}} of infants, but males also play a role. In its first few days, the infant {{may be unable to}} stay attached to its mother and relies on her for physical support. However, its grasp grows stronger by its first week and it is able to cling to its mother's fur by itself. By two weeks, the infant begins to explore its surroundings for short periods, but stays near her. The distance the infant spends away from its mother increases the older it gets. In general, higher-ranking females are usually more relaxed parents than females of lower rank, which usually keep their offspring close to them. However, this difference only lasts for approximately the first eight weeks of an infant's life. Olive baboons do not seem to practice co-operative parenting, but a female may groom an infant that is not hers. Subadult and juvenile females are more likely to care for another's young, as they have not yet produced offspring of their own. One theory for why immature females tend to seek out infants is that they can prepare for their future roles as mothers. Infant baboons born to first-time mothers suffer higher mortality than those born to experienced mothers, which suggests that prior experience in caring for infants is important. Adult males in the groups also care for the infants, as {{they are likely to be}} related to them. Males groom infants, reducing the amount of parasites they may have, and calm them when they <b>are</b> <b>stressed.</b> They may also protect them from predators, such as chimpanzees. However, adult males exploit infants and use them to reduce the likelihood that other males will threaten them.|$|E
25|$|The phrases are {{mentioned}} with accents to show where stress is placed. In Latin, most words <b>are</b> <b>stressed</b> at the second-last (penultimate) syllable, called in Latin paenultima or syllaba paenultima. A few words <b>are</b> <b>stressed</b> at the third-last syllable, called in Latin antepaenultima or syllaba antepaenultima.|$|E
