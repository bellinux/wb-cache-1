40|$|ABSTRACT: Using the {{traditional}} tribological wear tests {{it is not}} possible to completely verify the real final performance of a combination of biomaterials and hip joint prosthesis geometry. Thus, for such a complex bearing combination, a more physiologically representative implants wear test is required; this can only be provided using complex mechanical simulators capable to reproduce, as close as possible, the real in vivo physiological loading and motion replacement working conditions. In this paper a new model of hip joint simulator will be presented, developed in order to test different kinds of hip joint prosthetic implant materials under the in vivo working conditions. Unlike other existing multi-axis hip joint simulators, whose performance were initially accurately studied and classified in terms of transmitted force and reproduced motion accuracy and versatility of use, this hip joint simulator has been studied to stand out the state of the art for its superior accuracy in completely reproducing the physiological condition of time dependent loading and three-dimensional mutually <b>articulating</b> <b>bearing</b> surfaces, and also simulating the physiological environment...|$|R
40|$|For {{more than}} 50 years total hip {{replacements}} {{have been a}} common and successful procedure to increase patient mobility and quality of life. The 10 -year implant survival rate is 97. 8 %. However, for longer implantation times there are limitations linked to the negative biological response to wear and corrosion products from the currently used biomaterials. In this thesis silicon nitride (SiNx) coatings were evaluated for use in total hip replacements, on the <b>articulating</b> <b>bearing</b> surface and modular taper connections. Homogeneous, dense SiNx coatings were deposited using reactive high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) up to a thickness of 8 µm. The N/Si atomic ratios ranged from 0. 3 to 1. 1 and the coatings showed a low surface roughness. The wear rate of a SiNx coated cobalt chromium molybdenum alloy (CoCrMo) {{was similar to that}} of bulk Si 3 N 4, and less than one 46 th of uncoated CoCrMo, an alloy that is commonly used in joint replacements. Wear debris generated from SiNx coatings was round in shape, with a mean size of 40 nm, and ranged between 10 and 500 nm. Model particles, similar in size and shape as the wear debris, were soluble in simulated body fluid. The dissolution rate was higher than the expected rate of debris generation. Along with the size of the debris, which is not in the critical range for macrophage activation, this dissolution may limit negative biological reactions. The SiNx coatings also dissolved in simulated body fluid. The coating with the highest N/Si ratio exhibited the lowest dissolution rate, of 0. 2 to 0. 4 nm/day, while CoCrMo under the same condition dissolved at a rate of 0. 7 to 1. 2 nm/day. SiNx-coated CoCrMo exhibited a reduced release of Co, Cr and Mo ions into the solution by two orders of magnitude, compared to uncoated CoCrMo. Si 3 N 4 evaluated under micro-displacement in a corrosive environment, replicating the modular taper, showed a lower corrosion current compared to common biomedical alloys. SiNx coatings may also act beneficially to reduce issues associated with this type of contact. SiNx coatings have shown several properties in a laboratory environment that are hypothesised to increase the longevity of joint replacements. The promising results encourage further evaluation closer to the clinical application of total hip replacements, in particular in the <b>articulating</b> <b>bearing</b> surface and in modular tapers...|$|R

Current small joint arthroplasty designs, including those for the metacarpophalangeal joint of the hand, have had limited success owing to mechanical failures and {{can be divided into}} two main families: single-piece elastomer implants and surface articulating implants. The design proposed in this study involves combining the principles of a surface weight-bearing articulating implant with those of a spanning elastomeric implant. The design consists of metacarpal and proximal phalangeal articulating housings and a central flexible spanning elastomer rod that maintains the alignment of the metacarpal and proximal phalangeal components. A preliminary finite element analysis was used to investigate the stresses in the design, the wear of the <b>articulating</b> <b>bearing</b> surfaces for different material combinations, and the stresses between the central elastomer rod and the articulating housings. This preliminary analysis shows that the design should withstand the probable loading conditions experienced within the human body and that the wear rates of the articulating surfaces and the central elastomer are acceptable...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} individual and combined influences {{of the cup}} inclination and wear on the contact mechanics and fixation of a Charnley hip replacement using finite element method. The effects of cup inclination and penetration on the contact mechanics of <b>articulating</b> <b>bearings</b> {{as well as the}} stress within the cement and at the bone-cement interface were examined. The maximum contact pressure and the von Mises stress on the cup were reduced by ∼ 30 % and ∼ 20 % respectively when even a small penetration occurred. However, no large differences were found between different cup penetration depths with regards to either the contact pressure or the von Mises stress. The von Mises stress at the bone-cement interface was predicted almost unaltered with an increased cup inclination angle to 55 ° for a cup penetration to 4. mm. These predictions suggest that the contact mechanics and the cement stress are insensitive to the cup inclination and wear under these normal conditions investigated, therefore explaining the robustness of the Charnley hip implant. An increase in the cup inclination angle to 65 °, coupled with a maximum penetration of 4. mm, resulted in a large increase in the maximum von Mises stress at the bone-cement interface...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Instability after total hip {{arthroplasty}} (THA) is not a rare occurrence. Numerous {{factors have}} been associated with dislocation including surgical approach, implant design, failure to restore proper hip mechanics and soft tissue restraints, and patient variables such as early postoperative compliance, soft tissue integrity, and neurologic conditions such as poor proprioception. A thorough understanding of the mechanism of dislocation, timing, and direction of dislocation is mandatory in formulating an approach toward treatment. The radiographic evaluation should evaluate hip mechanics including component orientation, adequacy of leg lengths, and restoration of offset in the frontal and sagittal planes. The treatment of the unstable total hip replacement is based on numerous variables including the timing of instability, direction, and mechanism. Instability in the early postoperative period in the hip with proper orientation and restored mechanics often is treated successfully with patient reeducation and use of adjunctive bracing. The treatment of the recurrent dislocator can be more difficult. Although reestablishing proper mechanics and orientation can be successful in many instances, some patients continue to have dislocation. Constrained acetabular liners have significantly improved the success rate of reducing the incidence of dislocation, but problems related to premature wear and dislodgement are a major concern. The use of larger <b>articulating</b> <b>bearing</b> surfaces used with the newer cross-linked polyethylene may provide the solution to instability minimizing the concerns related to constrained components.

The focus {{of this study was to}} develop and validate a protocol to assess the fixation method of the femoral components in mechanical simulation, for pre-clinical validation; the wear behaviour of two different fixation frames was quantified and compared. In particular, two different wear tests were conducted using the same knee simulator, the same load profiles and the same kinematics; two different fixation methods were applied to the femoral sleds (synthetic femur and metal block). Surface characterization on both <b>articulating</b> <b>bearings</b> was performed by a roughness measuring machine and coordinate measuring machine. The wear produced by the tibial inserts using the synthetic femur was considerably higher than the wear registered by the metal-block holder. Roughness measurements on femoral sleds showed a limited number of scratches with high Rt values for the metal-block set-up; the damaged surface broadened in the case of femoral condyles and tibial inserts mounted on composite bone, but lower Rt and linear penetration values were measured. The two holding frames showed different wear activities as a consequence of dissimilar dynamic performance.

However, this construction of identity is seldom politicized in Motörhead songs. What is constructed instead is a ‘cultural otherness’ that has almost no links whatsoever to questions concerning oppression, material injustice and so on.

40|$|Background: Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and its {{composites}} are polymers {{resistant to}} fatigue strain, radiologically transparent, and have mechanical properties {{suitable for a}} range of orthopaedic applications. In bulk form, PEEK composites are generally accepted as biocompatible. In particulate form, however, the biologic response relevant to joint replacement devices remains unclear. The biologic response to wear particles affects the longevity of total joint arthroplasties. Particles in the phagocytozable size range of 0. 1 µm to 10 µm are considered the most biologically reactive, particularly particles with a mean size of < 1 µm. This systematic review aimed to identify the current evidence for the biological response to PEEK-based wear debris from total joint arthroplasties. Questions/purposes: (1) What are the quantitative characteristics of PEEK-based wear particles produced by total joint arthroplasties? (2) Do PEEK wear particles cause an adverse biologic response when compared with UHMWPE or a similar negative control biomaterial? (3) Is the biologic response affected by particle characteristics? Methods: Embase and Ovid Medline databases were searched for studies that quantified PEEK-based particle characteristics and/or investigated the biologic response to PEEK-based particles relevant to total joint arthroplasties. The keyword search included brands of PEEK (eg, MITCH, MOTIS) or variations of PEEK types and nomenclature (eg, PAEK, CFR-PEEK) in combination with types of joint (eg, hip, knee) and synonyms for wear debris or immunologic response (eg, particles, cytotoxicity). Peer-reviewed studies, published in English, investigating total joint arthroplasty devices and cytotoxic effects of PEEK particulates were included. Studies investigating devices without <b>articulating</b> <b>bearings</b> (eg, spinal instrumentation devices) and bulk material or contact cytotoxicity were excluded. Of 129 studies, 15 were selected for analysis and interpretation. No studies were found that isolated and characterized PEEK wear particles from retrieved periprosthetic human tissue samples. Results: In the four studies that quantified PEEK-based particles produced using hip, knee, and spinal joint replacement simulators, the mean particle size was 0. 23 µm to 2. 0 µm. The absolute range reported was approximately 0. 01 µm to 50 µm. Rod-like carbon particulates and granular-shaped PEEK particles were identified in human tissue by histologic analysis. Ten studies, including six animal models (rat, mouse, and rabbit), three cell line experiments, and two human tissue retreival studies, investigated the biologic response to PEEK-based particles. Qualitative histologic assessments showed immunologic cell infiltration to be similar for PEEK particles when compared with UHMWPE particles in all six of the animal studies identified. However, increased inflammatory cytokine release (such as tumor necrosis factor-α) was identified in only one in vitro study, but without substantial suppression in macrophage viability. Only one study tested the effects of particle size on cytotoxicity and found the largest unfilled PEEK particles (approximately 13 µm) to have a toxic effect; UHMWPE particles in the same size range showed a similar cytotoxic effect. Conclusions: Wear particles produced by PEEK-based bearings were, in almost all cases, in the phagocytozable size range (0. 1 - 10 µm). The studies that evaluated the biologic response to PEEK-based particles generally found cytotoxicity to be within acceptable limits relative to the UHMWPE control, but inconsistent when inflammatory cytokine release was considered. Clinical Relevance: To translate new and advanced materials into clinical use more quickly, the clinical relevance and validity of preclinical tests need to be improved. To achieve this for PEEK-based devices, human tissue retrieval studies including subsequent particle isolation and characterization analyses are required. In vitro cell studies using isolated wear particles from tissue or validated joint replacement simulators, instead of manufactured particles, are also required...|$|R
40|$|Ultra {{high-molecular}} weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) {{remains the}} most commonly used material in modern joint replacement prostheses. However, UHMWPE wear particles, formed as the <b>bearing</b> <b>articulates,</b> are one of the main factors leading to joint replacement failure via the induction of osteolysis and subsequent aseptic loosening. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} addition of antioxidants such as vitamin E to UHMWPE can improve wear resistance of the polymer and reduce oxidative fatigue. However, little is known regarding the biological consequences of such antioxidant chemicals. This study investigated the cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory effects of a variety of antioxidant compounds currently being tested experimentally for use in hip and knee prostheses, including nitroxides, hindered phenols, and lanthanides on U 937 human histocyte cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) in vitro. After addition of the compounds, cell viability was determined by dose response cytotoxicity studies. Anti-inflammatory effects were determined by quantitation of TNF-α release in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated cells. This study has shown that many of these compounds were cytotoxic to U 937 cells and PBMNCs, at relatively low concentrations (micromolar), specifically the hindered phenol 3, 5 -di-tert-butyl- 4 -hydroxyhydrocinnamate (HPAO 1), and the nitroxide 2, 2, 6, 6 -Tetramethylpiperidine 1 -oxyl (TEMPO). Lanthanides were only cytotoxic at very high concentrations and were well tolerated by the cells at lower concentrations. Cytotoxic compounds also showed reduced anti-inflammatory effects, particularly in PBMNCs. Careful consideration should therefore be given to the use of any of these compounds as potential additives to UHMWPE...|$|R
40|$|This written {{commentary}} {{describes how}} pieces were composed from individual strands of music, independent parts combined in a polyphonic style. A {{study of the}} rules of species counterpoint in Fux’s Gradus Ad Parnassum inspired the first compositions; a modified set of rules, developed from the writings of Fux controlled initial pitch-organisation. This set of rules underwent modifications informed by innovations introduced in subsequent compositions. The theories discussed in Xenakis’ Symbolic Music were utilised to generate pre-compositional pitch-sets and duration-sets. The pitch-sets were organised vertically to produce chords. These developments led to considerations of form, proportion and structure in the research. Changes in tonality with an associated contrast of chords <b>articulated</b> formal sections, <b>bearing</b> similarity {{to the use of the}} contrast of key found in traditional tonality. The pre-composed duration-sets gave more impetus and rhythmic momentum to the music and expanded the overall rhythmic content. Speculation on the ideas of musical Platonism raised two questions: Which musical elements might be considered universal? Is the act of composition invention or discovery? Furthermore, does a composer discover a copy of an eternal Platonic Form? Contemplation upon the metaphysics of Plato and Platonic Forms inspired an extension of Xenakis’ Symbolic Music using numbers, specifically integers, similar in construction to Gödel Numbers. Once music has been encoded symbolically as an integer the fundamental elements of the music may be manipulated, to produce an alternative copy of an eternal Platonic Form. Compositions by John Dowland and Palestrina were encoded symbolically and the encoding was used to control the rhythm, pitch and harmonic structure of new compositions...|$|R
40|$|The {{testing of}} a rocket engine oxygen {{turbopump}} using high pressure ambient temperature nitrogen and oxygen as the turbine drive gas in separate test series is discussed. The pumped fluid was liquid nitrogen or liquid oxygen. The turbopump (TPA) {{is designed to}} operate with 400 F oxygen turbine drive gas which will be demonstrated in a subsequent test series. Following bearing tests, the TPA was finish machined (impeller blading and inlet/outlet ports). Testing started on 15 February 1989 and was successfully concluded on 21 March 1989. Testing started using nitrogen to reduce the ignition hazard during initial TPA checkout. The Hydrostatic Bearing System requires a Bearing Pressurization System. Initial testing used a separate bearing supply to prevent a rubbing start. Two test series were successfully completed with the bearing assist supplied only by the pump second stage output which entailed a rubbing start until pump pressure builds up. The final test series used ambient oxygen drive and no external bearing assist. Total operating time was 2268 seconds. There were 14 starts without bearing assist and operating speeds up to 80, 000 rpm were logged.

40|$|Background: Aseptic {{loosening}} is {{the most}} common single cause for revisions in major joint arthroplasties worldwide. Different theories for aseptic loosening have been discussed during the last two decades. There is a need for improving fixation in both cemented and uncemented implants. Aims: To investigate if wear particles alone can induce aseptic loosening in a stable joint implant and if sodium fluoride loaded bone cement improves fixation of implants in rabbits with or without oestrogen defiency. Material, Methods and Results: The Miller-Galante I (MG I) prosthesis was designed to achieve permanent stability through bone ingrowth into a titanium fiber mesh. Thirty-five knees in 30 patients with MG I knee replacements have been followed clinically and radiologically with a mean follow-up of 12 years. Twenty knees were revised. Light microscopical histomorphometrical investigations of tissue integration were performed on the revised components. Patello-femoral problems, especially avulsion of the polyethylene from the metal backed patella and in some cases severe metallosis have been the main reasons for revision. Substantial wear debris was exposed to the interfacial tissues. Despite this the fixation of the components has been excellent {{with a high degree of}} osseous ingrowth displayed at histological analysis. The used rabbit model was a weight <b>bearing,</b> <b>articulating</b> prosthetic joint repeatedly injected with submicron particles of Ultra-High-Molecular-Weight-Polyethylene (UHMWPE) produced in a hip simulator. Twelve lop-eared rabbits were included in the study. Histomorphometrical investigations demonstrated no statistically significant differences between rabbits receiving UHMWPE particles (test) and those that received saline (control). The Ultra-High-Molecular-Weight-Polyethylene debris did not induce any significant osteolysis, indicating that an osseointegrated implant with a sealed interface may not be affected by UHMWPE debris nor progress to aseptic loosening. We investigated if addition of sodium fluoride to poly-metylmetacrylate (Cemex®) could improve fixation to bone. Nine mature lop-eared rabbits were included in the study. A femoral prosthesis was inserted in both knees to resurface the femuropatellar articulation. The same type of Cemex® bone cement with and without NaF was used on both sides. Two screw shaped implants machined from cured rods of test and control cement were also inserted bilaterally into the proximal tibia. Qualitative and quantitative histomorphometrical studies of the bone tissue surrounding the cement in the femur and of the the intact implants revealed similar results regardless if NaF had been added or not. The removal torque necessary to loosen the implants from the bone bed did not significantly differ between the two cements. Our findings indicate that addition of NaF has little effect on implant stability and bone remodelling in healthy rabbits in the short-term perspective. Finally, we investigated bone integration of threaded implants made of cured polymethylmethacrylate containing sodium fluoride or commercially pure titanium (c. p. ti.) grade 1 in normal and oestrogen deficient New Zealand white rabbits. Nine rabbits had been ovariectomized through laparoscopy and nine served as controls. Four weeks after the ovariectomy two threaded implants made of cured bone cement with or without sodium fluoride addition were inserted in each tibia and one threaded c. p. ti grade 1 implant was inserted in each patello-femoral joint. Measurement of the peak removal torque necessary to loosen the implants and light microscopical histomorphometrical investigations of tissue integration were performed. In the ovariectomized rabbits addition of sodium fluoride to the cement resulted in an increased area of bone in the threads (p= 0. 04). In the non ovariectomized rabbits no significant differences were found between test and control implants. The removal torque was lower in the ovariectomized rabbits compared to the non-ovariectomized rabbits when comparing implants with sodium fluoride addition (p= 0. 02). The bone tissue response and the removal torque of the titanium implants were not influenced by ovariectomy in these rabbits. Conclusions: Aseptic loosening could not be demonstrated despite high loads of debris indicating that wear particles alone do not cause aseptic loosening and that additional factors are needed. A stable osseointegrated implant in rabbits had high resistance to endotoxin free submicron UHMWPE wear particles and such particles were not able to cause aseptic loosening alone. Sodium fluoride addition to commercially available bone cement may improve bone formation around the cement, although this was only demonstrated in ovariectomised rabbits...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 To the Funhouse: W. G. Sebald's Playful Intertextuality {{examines}} intertextual and intermedial {{techniques of}} narrative composition {{in the works}} of W. G. Sebald (1944 - 2001) as a creative and ludic methodological device that confronts and disrupts modes of <b>articulating</b> memory and <b>bearing</b> witness in literature. As one of the most acclaimed contemporary German authors, Sebald is widely respected for his careful treatment of 20 th century European history, especially the Holocaust {{and its impact on the}} German and Austrian literary landscape and psyche. In my dissertation I propose, however, that Sebald's prose texts are more playful than has been recognized and move, instead, beyond the depiction of trauma, suffering, and melancholia. My project suggests that Sebald's practice of intertextuality and intermediality constitutes a unique and playful method of articulating hope through a complex layering of fragments of literary and visual historical testimonies, and that serves as a critique of linear epistemology. In addition to fluctuating between fiction and nonfiction and crossing borders between genres and media, Sebald's texts assemble embellished, falsified, or stolen quotations into a disorienting intertextual funhouse in which the works of forerunners are placed as if in a hall of mirrors, which reflect and distort the original sources from literature, biography, film, journalism, historiography, painting, and photography. By examining his allusions to playful writers, or "precursors," such as Vladimir Nabokov and John Barth I suggest that he is a carnivalesque trickster. Sebald's borrowings from a variety of cultural productions are a response to the crisis of representation in literature since WW II and a comment on and enactment of a complexly layered postmodern historiographical process, a kind of performative literary architecture that is hyperaware of its forerunners and at the same time questions the concept of precursors itself. My dissertation argues that Sebald's texts represent a turning point in the process of Vergangenheitsbewältigung (overcoming of the past) in contemporary German writing, and propose writing as a form of therapy that reconstructs the modern individual as a mosaic of fragments. Chapter 1 : "Die Buchstabenbrücke aus dem Unglück in den Trost:" Border Crossings in Schwindel. Gefühle. The study begins with an analysis of Sebald's first prose text, Schwindel. Gefühle., and with a comparison between it and two preceding collections of Sebald's critical essays, Unheimliche Heimat and Die Beschreibung des Unglücks. I argue that Sebald's development as a creative writer is rooted in his work as a literary critic. Schwindel. Gefühle. plots an escapist, if imaginary, Italy against the negative realm of Germany/Austria, which is pictured as the uncanny homeland Sebald had analyzed in Unheimliche Heimat, and associated with unhappiness. However, following a statement in the foreword to Die Beschreibung des Unglücks, Sebald uses melancholy as a form of resistance and transfigures his narrator's death wish into a mental and textual exercise. This chapter furthermore examines pretexts by Sigmund Freud, Otto Rank, Albrecht Schaeffer, Franz Kafka, Adalbert Stifter, and Ingeborg Bachmann. My analyses show that Schwindel. Gefühle. is a text defined by polarities and the boundaries between them and juxtaposes a religious worldview to a rational, modern mindset. The sense of loss of an uncanny patria is mitigated in the end by a reliance on art, specifically texts, as redemptive and creates a bridge of words to a fictive Bohemia that restores the sense of a homeland in the imagination. Chapter 2 : The Moth, the Dachshund, the Squirrel, and its Tricks: Reflections of Nabokov in Austerlitz In my second chapter, I expand on the reaffirmation of life through art discernible in Schwindel. Gefühle. by turning to an analysis of the intriguing and intricate interweaving of Vladimir Nabokov's texts into Austerlitz. I describe the playful intertextual connections between Austerlitz and works by Nabokov (Speak, Memory, Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle, Pale Fire, and Pnin). In particular, I show that Sebald borrows animals from Nabokov's texts as metaphors for memory. In Austerlitz and in Nabokov's texts, the transcendence of time and space are paramount themes. Sebald incorporates magical elements and glossy memories from his forerunner, but also suffuses Nabokov's manner of remembering with a dimension of sadness, instantiating Borges's comment that "every writer creates his own precursor" and going beyond it by inviting a reassessment of the source text. In Austerlitz, through allusions to intertexts by Nabokov and the emulation of Nabokov's methodology, hope is articulated by the transformation of life into art. Consequently, I make the case that the end of Austerlitz leaves room for hope and closure. By copying Nabokov's style and borrowing his characters, Sebald reveals himself as a postmodern trickster. Chapter 3 : Landscape with the Fall of Icarus: W. G. Sebald's Suffolk The project next turns to Sebald's third work of creative prose fiction, Die Ringe des Saturn. Here I investigate painting and trace Sebald's movement from intertextuality to intermediality, especially to a painterly perspective. I also analyze the presence of the Icarus myth, which symbolizes, on the one hand, an escape from the labyrinth of past disasters, and, on the other hand, the moral fall of humankind caused by ambitions and technological advancements. With its focus on painting and conceptualization of eco-catastrophes, Die Ringe des Saturn reconnects to Sebald's first creative text, the prose poem Nach der Natur, which I document as an intertext throughout. Sebald's most melancholy text vacillates between a nostalgic 19 th-century and a bitter 20 th-century point of view, which emerges as one of several tensions that dominate this travelogue. Other tensions analyzed are the constant shifts of perspective and the narrator's ambiguous stance towards colonialism and imperialism. Sebald filters "Africa" and "China" through exclusively European texts, and constructs them as inaccessible, imaginary spaces without a present, which calls into question the text's ostensible concern with the legacy of colonial and imperial ventures. I demonstrate that Die Ringe des Saturn, rather than resolving these vacillations, turns away from the entrapments of texts and moves towards painting as a less fraught artistic representation of history. Chapter 4 : Falsification as Disruptive Method in Austerlitz and Die Ausgewanderten Die Die Ausgewanderten and Austerlitz are closely related, and Jacques Austerlitz shares attributes with the four emigrants from Die Ausgewanderten, therefore my dissertation ends with a chapter that analyzes both of these texts. The presence of falsified diaries in "Max Aurach" and "Ambros Adelwarth" anticipates the central theme and narrative strategy of forgery in Austerlitz, which contains appropriated Holocaust memoirs (by Saul Friedländer and Susi Bechhöfer). The metaphor of a funhouse, which Sebald playfully suggests in "Ambros Adelwarth" through intertextual similarity of the story to John Barth's paradigmatic postmodern text "Lost in the Funhouse," develops into Sebald's complex model of a hall of mirrors in Austerlitz. Like Max Aurach, Jacques Austerlitz is a composite character whose experiences derive from genuine traumatic memories of survivors, an act of borrowing at odds with playful postmodern techniques of composition. My project analyzes whether Sebald's use of Holocaust memoirs is ethical and arrives at the conclusion that he deliberately engages with the themes of appropriation and falsification by playfully transfiguring them into a formal, semantic, and literary metaphor. Austerlitz and "Ambros Adelwarth" comment on inadequate and derivative processes of remembering and demonstrate that historiography is an undertaking that necessarily contains lacunae and errors. In this chapter I also analyze intertexts by Walter Benjamin and Vladimir Nabokov, among others, and films by Orson Welles and Fritz Lang, and suggest that a carnivalesque reading of Austerlitz and Die Ausgewanderten is best suited for taking account of the provocative disruptions these texts create...|$|R
