The syrup is shipped from Ireland, where it is added at the ratio of 1:49 to locally brewed pale beer. Each year, six million litres of GFE are made using 9,000 tonnes of barley. Guinness Flavour Extract was first created by scientists working for the company in the early 1960s. In 2003, production of GFE was relocated from St James's Gate to the former Cherry's brewery in Mary Street, Waterford, but in 2013 production returned to St James's.|$|E

Chops <b>and</b> <b>roasts</b> were vacuum packaged, precooked to 60 °C and stored at 2 °C for 0, 7, 14, 28, or 56 days. Lipid oxidation was lower in VITE chops <b>and</b> <b>roasts</b> than in CON chops <b>and</b> <b>roasts.</b> Off-flavor intensity scores were more acceptable and storage/ cooking losses were lower for VITE roasts than for CON roasts. Supplementation of vitamin E in a swine diet provided added protection against lipid oxidation and precooking pork under vacuum provided a palatable product with a shelf-life of 56 days...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} various cooking methods (boiling, steaming, stir-frying, <b>and</b> <b>roasting)</b> <b>and</b> three cooking times (5, 10, and 15 min) on the antioxidant properties of red pepper. Raw and cooked peppers were measured for proximate composition, ascorbic acid (AsA) content, total carotenoid content (TCC), total polyphenol content (TP), and 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2, 2 '-azino-bis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging activities. Results showed that the proximate composition, AsA content, TCC, TP, and antioxidant activities were significantly (p< 0. 05) affected by the cooking procedure; the loss rate varied among individual compounds. Boiling and steaming significantly reduced AsA content (24. 3 ～ 66. 5 %), TP (13. 9 ～ 54. 9 %), and antioxidant activity (21. 7 ～ 60. 5 %) in red pepper, while stir-frying <b>and</b> <b>roasting</b> slightly reduced AsA content (2. 7 ～ 25. 9 %), TP (1. 8 ～ 4. 9 %), and antioxidant activity (4. 9 ～ 17. 9 %). The highest loss was observed after boiling, followed by steaming, <b>roasting,</b> <b>and</b> stir-frying. Stir-frying <b>and</b> <b>roasting</b> better preserved AsA content, TCC, TP, and antioxidant activity. In conclusion, dry-heat cooking methods such as stir-frying <b>and</b> <b>roasting</b> may be preferred to retain the nutrient compositions and antioxidant properties of red pepper...|$|R

Steak <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> meat were translated as yakiniku (焼肉) and iriniku (焙肉), respectively, as proposed western-style menus in Seiyō Ryōri Shinan although this usage of the former word was eventually replaced by the loanword sutēki.|$|E
