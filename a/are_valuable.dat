The value dropped {{somewhat}} when the boom in commemorative coins burst in late 1936, but quickly recovered and the coins <b>are</b> <b>valuable</b> today. Melish has been assailed by numismatic writers for greed.|$|E
5|$|Most {{molluscs}} with shells {{can produce}} pearls, {{but only the}} pearls of bivalves and some gastropods, whose shells are lined with nacre, <b>are</b> <b>valuable.</b> The best natural pearls are produced by marine pearl oysters, Pinctada margaritifera and Pinctada mertensi, which live in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Pacific Ocean. Natural pearls form when a small foreign object gets stuck between the mantle and shell.|$|E
50|$|While Rashid et al. did not examine lurkers directly, they {{conducted}} an experimental study on MovieLens that investigated {{how to raise}} low contribution rates in online communities. They discovered that participants showed a higher likelihood of rating movies when ratings <b>were</b> <b>valuable</b> to someone than when ratings {{were associated with the}} probability of having previously watched a movie. Furthermore, they found that participants showed an enhanced likelihood of rating movies when ratings <b>were</b> <b>valuable</b> to MovieLens subgroups than when ratings <b>were</b> <b>valuable</b> to the entire MovieLens online community, and participants demonstrated an enhanced likelihood of rating movies when ratings <b>were</b> <b>valuable</b> to individuals who liked similar movie genres as the participant than when ratings <b>were</b> <b>valuable</b> to individuals who liked dissimilar movie genres as the participant. These authors also found that participants demonstrated a reduced likelihood of rating movies when ratings <b>were</b> <b>valuable</b> to oneself than when ratings <b>were</b> <b>valuable</b> to someone else. Given these findings, Rashid et al. claim, “…designers can use information about the beneficiaries of contributions to create subtle and integrated messages to increase motivation”(p. 958).|$|R

Second, they present a rough picture of Jesus that is compatible with that found in the Christian sources: that Jesus was a teacher, {{had a reputation as}} a miracle worker, had a brother James, and died a violent death.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis has {{a strong}} {{hereditary}} component, and many genes are associated with it, but {{it is unclear how}} those genes work together. Most of the identified genes relate to the immune system, particularly the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and T cells. Genetic studies <b>are</b> <b>valuable</b> due to their ability to identify molecular mechanisms and pathways for further study and potential drug targets.|$|E
5|$|Special coins {{for sale}} to {{collectors}} were struck in proof finish through {{the run of the}} Susan B. Anthony dollar, and some minting variations <b>are</b> <b>valuable</b> to collectors. However, most circulation strikes remained in government stockpiles for several years after minting, so many of the coins are available in uncirculated grades, and the premium over face value is minimal.|$|E

5|$|ZnO is {{a wide-bandgap}} {{semiconductor}} of the II-VI semiconductor group. The native doping of the semiconductor due to oxygen vacancies or zinc interstitials is n-type. This semiconductor has several favorable properties, including good transparency, high electron mobility, wide bandgap, and strong room-temperature luminescence. Those properties <b>are</b> <b>valuable</b> in emerging applications for: transparent electrodes in liquid crystal displays, energy-saving or heat-protecting windows, and electronics as thin-film transistors and light-emitting diodes.|$|E
5|$|As {{threats to}} bird populations grow and extinctions continue, {{historical}} specimens <b>are</b> <b>valuable</b> in documenting {{the impacts of}} human activities and causes of decline for threatened species. Bird collections have also been used to gauge the flow of environmental pollutants over time. A study of soot deposits on specimens collected within the United States Manufacturing Belt was used to track concentrations of atmospheric black carbon over a 135-year span. Other possible uses for bird specimens not known today may arise in the future.|$|E

5|$|Fraser {{was engaged}} to design the coin on the {{recommendation}} of the United States Commission of Fine Arts. The coins were flown from the San Francisco Mint, where they were struck, to Washington state by airplane as a publicity stunt. They sold badly; much of the issue was returned for redemption and melting, and the failure may have been a factor in one official's suicide. Due to the low number of surviving pieces, the coins <b>are</b> <b>valuable</b> today.|$|E
5|$|Many natural poisons act as {{neurotoxins}} {{that can}} cause paralysis leading to death and have functions for defence against predators or in hunting and capturing prey. Some of these natural inhibitors, despite their toxic attributes, <b>are</b> <b>valuable</b> for therapeutic uses at lower doses. An example of a neurotoxin are the glycoalkaloids, from the plant species in the Solanaceae family (includes potato, tomato and eggplant), that are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Inhibition of this enzyme causes an uncontrolled increase in the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, muscular paralysis and then death. Neurotoxicity can also result from the inhibition of receptors; for example, atropine from deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) that functions as a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.|$|E

5|$|Returning to Camp Victory {{in their}} Humvee, the team {{encounters}} five armed men in traditional Arab garb and casual attire standing near a Ford Excursion, {{which has a}} flat tire. James' team has a tense encounter with their leader, who reveals that they are private military contractors and British mercenaries. They have captured two prisoners featured on the most-wanted Iraqi playing cards. The group comes under fire; when the prisoners attempt to escape in the confusion, {{the leader of the}} mercenaries shoots them, as they <b>are</b> <b>valuable</b> dead or alive. Enemy snipers kill three of the mercenaries, including their leader. Sanborn and James borrow a gun to dispatch three attackers, while Eldridge kills a fourth.|$|E
5|$|No {{attacks on}} humans have been {{attributed}} to the longfin mako shark. Nevertheless, its large size and teeth make it potentially dangerous. This shark is caught, generally in low numbers, as bycatch on longlines intended for tuna, swordfish, and other pelagic sharks, as well as in anchored gillnets and on hook-and-line. The meat is marketed fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, though it is considered to be of poor quality due to its mushy texture. The fins are also considered to be of lower quality for use in shark fin soup, though <b>are</b> <b>valuable</b> enough that captured sharks are often finned at sea. The carcasses may be processed into animal feed and fishmeal, while the skin, cartilage, and jaws are also of value.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} heavy {{emphasis on}} environmental destruction using a procedural destruction system. Players can break structures by planting explosives on them, or shoot walls to make bullet holes. Players may gain tactical advantages through environmental destruction, and the system aims at encouraging players to utilize creativity and strategy. A bullet-penetration system is featured, in which bullets that pass through structures deal less damage to enemies. In addition to destruction, players can also set up heavy-duty fortifications on walls and deployable shields around them for protection; these can be destroyed through breaching or by utilizing operator specific melee-weapons like sledgehammers. In order to stop attackers' advance, defenders can place traps like barbed-wire and explosive laserwire traps around the maps. Vertical space is a key gameplay element in the game's maps: players can destroy ceilings and floors using breach charges and can ambush enemies by rappelling through windows. Powerful weapons like grenades and breach charges <b>are</b> <b>valuable,</b> as only limited numbers {{can be used in}} a round.|$|E

5|$|The meat, oil, bones, {{and skin}} of {{manatees}} <b>are</b> <b>valuable</b> items. In some countries, such as Nigeria and Cameroon, African manatees are sold to zoos, aquariums, and online as pets, sometimes being shipped internationally. Though illegal, lack {{of law enforcement}} in these areas induce poaching. Some residents of West African countries, such as Mali and Chad, depend on the oil of the African manatee to cure ailments such as ear infections, rheumatism, and skin conditions. Hunting is the largest source of mortality in Amazonian manatees, {{and there are no}} management plans except for in Colombia. Amazonian manatees, especially calves, are sometimes illegally sold as pets, but there are several institutions that care for and rescue these orphans, with the possibility of their releasing into the wild. The body parts of Dugongs are used as medicinal remedies across the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia, {{which the}} Sumatran rhino inhabits, are also targets for {{legal and illegal}} logging because of the {{desirability}} of their hardwoods. Rare woods such as merbau, meranti and semaram <b>are</b> <b>valuable</b> on the international markets, fetching as much as $1,800perm3 ($1,375percuyd). Enforcement of illegal-logging laws is difficult because humans live within or near {{many of the same}} forests as the rhino. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake has been used to justify new logging. Although the hardwoods in the rainforests of the Sumatran rhino are destined for international markets and not widely used in domestic construction, the number of logging permits for these woods has increased dramatically because of the tsunami. However, while this species has been suggested to be highly sensitive to habitat disturbance, apparently it is of little importance compared to hunting, as it can withstand more or less any forest condition.|$|E
5|$|The reverse design had in 1895 been {{modified}} by Engraver of the Royal Mint George William de Saulles. Following Queen Victoria's death in 1901, de Saulles was {{called upon to}} create a design for the obverse featuring Edward VII. This appeared on the penny in 1902, and remained in use until the year of King Edward's death, 1910. An obverse design by Sir Bertram Mackennal depicting George V went into use in 1911, and remained with some modification until {{the year of the}} King's death, 1936. No pennies were produced for commerce in 1933, as there were a sufficient number in circulation. At least seven were struck that year, mostly for placement beneath foundation stones and in museums; they <b>are</b> <b>valuable</b> today. Edward VIII's short reign is only represented by a single pattern coin, dated 1937. That year, a new obverse design depicting George VI by Humphrey Paget went into use. During the Second World War period of 1941 to 1943, pennies were struck only for the colonies; these are all dated 1940, the most recent year of production for the United Kingdom. After the war, demand for the penny began to diminish. Most of the 1950 and 1951 pieces were sent to Bermuda, with many retrieved from circulation and repatriated by British coin dealers because of their relative scarcity.|$|E
