40|$|Metagenomic methods amplifying 16 S ribosomal RNA genes {{have been}} used to {{describe}} the microbial diversity of healthy skin and lesion stages of bovine digital dermatitis (DD) and to detect critical pathogens involved with disease pathogenesis. In this study, we characterized the microbiome and for the first time, the composition of functional genes of healthy skin (HS), active (<b>ADD)</b> <b>and</b> inactive (IDD) lesion stages using a whole-genome shotgun approach. Metagenomic sequences were annotated using MG-RAST pipeline. Six phyla were identified as the most abundant. Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were the predominant bacterial phyla in the microbiome of HS, while Spirochetes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were highly abundant in <b>ADD</b> <b>and</b> IDD. T. denticola-like, T. vincentii-like and T. phagedenis-like constituted the most abundant species in <b>ADD</b> <b>and</b> IDD. Recruitment plots comparing sequences from HS, <b>ADD</b> <b>and</b> IDD samples to the genomes of specific Treponema spp., supported the presence of T. denticola and T. vincentii in <b>ADD</b> <b>and</b> IDD. Comparison of the functional composition of HS to <b>ADD</b> <b>and</b> IDD identified a significant difference in genes associated with motility/chemotaxis and iron acquisition/metabolism. We also provide evidence that the microbiome of <b>ADD</b> <b>and</b> IDD compared to that of HS had significantly higher abundance of genes associated with resistance to copper and zinc, which are commonly used in footbaths to prevent and control DD. In conclusion, the results from this study provide new insights into the HS, <b>ADD</b> <b>and</b> IDD microbiomes, improve our understanding of the disease pathogenesis and generate unprecedented knowledge regarding the functional genetic composition of the digital dermatitis microbiome...|$|R
40|$|Fifteen boys aged six to ten {{who met the}} {{criteria}} for attention deficit disorder (ADD) were compared with ten boys {{who did not have}} ADD in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-crossover study of methylphenidate. To assess the degree of overlap between <b>ADD</b> <b>and</b> central auditory processing disorder (CAPD), all subjects were assessed on parent and teacher behavior rating scales, as well as a battery of CAPD tests at baseline and after three and six weeks of treatment. Twelve of the 15 subjects with <b>ADD</b> <b>and</b> none of the subjects without ADD met {{the criteria}} for CAPD. The subjects with ADD also responded to stimulant treatment on the measures of both <b>ADD</b> <b>and</b> CAPD. The overlap in the symptomatology of these disorders, the finding that the criteria for both disorders were met in 12 of 15 cases and the sensitivity of both <b>ADD</b> <b>and</b> CAPD measures to treatment with methylphenidate suggest that <b>ADD</b> <b>and</b> CAPD are closely related disorders. The implications of these results are three-fold. First, sustained attention is a critical feature of performance on CAPD tests and the current diagnostic criteria for CAPD make a clinical separation of the two disorders problematic. Second, stimulants appear to be a useful treatment for the symptoms of both <b>ADD</b> <b>and</b> CAPD. Third, CAPD tests may be a useful measure of <b>ADD</b> symptomatology <b>and</b> response to stimulants...|$|R

5|$|In 1903, Bill Hayward coached Albany College's track team. Following Oregon's {{defeat at}} the hands of Albany College, Oregon hired Bill Hayward as the track and field head coach for the {{following}} season. Hayward's career at Oregon was long and illustrious, lasting 44 years as head coach. His athletes included nine Olympians and produced five world records. In 1919, a new stadium was constructed for football and named Hayward Field for him. Two years following construction, a track was <b>added</b> <b>and</b> track schedules were transferred there from nearby Kincaid Field.|$|E

The loggia, windows, and other openings were covered with cinderblocks and brick.|$|E
40|$|There {{are large}} {{overlaps}} in cognitive deficits occurring in {{attention deficit disorder}} (<b>ADD)</b> <b>and</b> neurodevelopmental disorders like neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1). This overlap is mostly based on clinical measures and not on in-depth analyses of neuronal mechanisms. However, the consideration of such neuronal underpinnings is crucial when aiming to integrate measures {{that can lead to}} a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Inhibitory control deficits, for example, are a hallmark in ADD, but it is unclear how far there are similar deficits in NF 1. We thus compared adolescent <b>ADD</b> <b>and</b> NF 1 patients to healthy controls in a Go/Nogo task using behavioural and neurophysiological measures. Clinical measures of ADD-symptoms were not different between <b>ADD</b> <b>and</b> NF 1. Only patients with ADD showed increased Nogo errors and reductions in components reflecting response inhibition (i. e. Nogo-P 3). Early perceptual processes (P 1) were changed in <b>ADD</b> <b>and</b> NF 1. Clinically, patients with <b>ADD</b> <b>and</b> NF 1 thus show strong similarities. This is not the case in regard to underlying cognitive control processes. This shows that in-depth analyses of neurophysiological processes are needed to determine whether the overlap between <b>ADD</b> <b>and</b> NF 1 is as strong as assumed and to develop appropriate treatment strategies...|$|R

The room count was reduced to 715 to provide more luxurious accommodations. The nine-story Palm Tower was completed, the lagoon-style pool was <b>added,</b> <b>and</b> notable changes {{were made to the}} Grand Lobby Atrium, Starlight Lounge, Villas Del Lago, and new golf shop and country club.

A radar system is installed later in the game, allowing the player to locate Rebel supply caches. In the final battle, a rear-mounted storage rack for Magnusson Devices is <b>added</b> <b>and</b> the radar is adjusted to track enemies and Magnusson Device dispensers. A homing unit is also installed so the player can quickly locate the car in the chaos of the final battle via a readout in the Hazardous Environment suit.|$|E

To accomplish this, a locking device was <b>added</b> <b>and</b> the leaf-spring was moved from the jack to the plug, so that the most-stressed part is on the cable side of the connection. This change was made so that the connector on the less expensive cable would bear the most wear.|$|E
