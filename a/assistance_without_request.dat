40|$|An {{intelligent}} {{human-computer interface}} {{is expected to}} allow computers to work with users in a cooperative manner. To achieve this goal, computers {{need to be aware}} of user attention and provide <b>assistances</b> <b>without</b> explicit user <b>request.</b> Cognitive studies of eye movements suggest that in accomplishing well-learned tasks, the performer's focus of attention is locked with the ongoing work and more than 90 % of eye movements are closely related to the objects being manipulated in the tasks. In light of this, we have developed an attentional object spotting system that integrates multimodal data consisting of eye positions, head positions and video from the "first-person" perspective. To detect the user's focus of attention, we modeled eye gaze and head movements using a hidden Markov model(HMM) representation. For each attentional point in time, the object of user interest is automatically extracted and recognized. We report the results of experiments on finding attentional objects in the natural task of "making a peanut-butter sandwich". 1...|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Shah {{founded and}} served as the {{executive}} director of Psychosocial <b>Assistance</b> <b>Without</b> Borders from 2001 to 2007. In this charitable and service organization, he consolidated strategies to build psychosocial capacity to aid victims of complex emergencies while simultaneously preventing vicarious trauma in the workers themselves. Through his development of ethnomedical competence principles, he also integrated locally available treatments with Western treatments. In parallel to Psychosocial <b>Assistance</b> <b>without</b> Borders, Shah also founded Greenleaf Integrative Strategies in 2002 for his training and education work. [...] Psychosocial <b>Assistance</b> <b>without</b> Borders operated as a charity, and was funded by donations from individuals. Shah gradually began doing charitable work under the auspices of other organizations. He thus discontinued building Psychosocial <b>Assistance</b> <b>without</b> Borders as a standalone non-profit, favoring to keep it as an intellectual platform.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{component}} was {{the requirement}} of reciprocity from the North. Initially it was intended that the two States would treat each other as equals, each making concessions and compromises. Perhaps most criticism of the policy stemmed from the significant backpedaling by the South on this principle {{in the face of}} unexpected rigidity from the North. It ran into trouble just two months into the Sunshine era, when South Korea requested the creation of a reunion center for divided families in exchange for fertilizer assistance; North Korea denounced this as horse trading and cut off talks. A year later the South announced its goal would be [...] "flexible reciprocity" [...] based on Confucian values; as the [...] "elder brother" [...] of the relationship the South would provide aid without expecting an immediate reciprocation and <b>without</b> <b>requesting</b> a specific form of reciprocity. The South also announced that it would provide humanitarian <b>assistance</b> <b>without</b> any expectations of concessions in return.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In IEEE 802. 16 networks, a {{bandwidth}} request-grant {{mechanism is}} employed for reducing data collision and sup-porting various QoS requirements. In this paper, we investigate {{the effectiveness of}} the mechanism on Best-Effort (BE) traffic. We first derive two candidate schemes for bandwidth request based on a simple analysis. Then, we present a comprehensive study on the performance of BE traffic associated with those schemes through extensive simulations. In this study, we include a scheme proposed for bandwidth allocation <b>without</b> <b>request.</b> This study shows that IEEE 802. 16 networks can be effectively managed through appropriate bandwidth request schemes. It is also shown that bandwidth allocation <b>without</b> <b>request</b> can be an alternative for increasing utilization. Finally, we show that the proposed schemes can be easily extended for non-real-time polling service without additional cost. I...|$|R
