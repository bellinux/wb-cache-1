5|$|The album debuted {{at number}} 86 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, but {{fell off the}} next week. It {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. Although some were ambivalent towards its loose blaxploitation concept and Saadiq's songwriting, critics praised the album's production quality and vintage musical <b>approach.</b> <b>It</b> is currently out of print.|$|E
5|$|The album embraces {{a form of}} {{symbolism}} {{that would}} eventually become a staple of Morrison's songs, equating earthly love and heaven, or as close as a living being can <b>approach</b> <b>it.</b> Morrison and Davis's upright bass {{can be interpreted as}} the earth opposing Kay's percussion and the string arrangement representing heaven and with Berliner's lead acoustic guitar residing on a plane in between.|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} also {{occasionally}} feeds on livestock or deer. It {{is the only}} species of New World vulture which preys on cattle. It occasionally harasses cows which are giving birth, but primarily preys on newborn calves. In its first few weeks, a calf will allow vultures to <b>approach</b> <b>it.</b> The vultures swarm the calf in a group, then peck at the calf's eyes, or at the nose or the tongue. The calf then goes into shock and is killed by the vultures. Black vultures have sometimes been seen to pick ticks off resting capybaras.|$|E

5|$|The {{creative}} {{team was}} largely {{recruited from the}} mainstream adult UK comedy scene. They took inspiration from such quintessentially British historical-comedy classics as Blackadder and the Monty Python films. The series was a critical and ratings success, eventually gaining a wide all ages audience through its non-condescending and inclusive <b>approach.</b> <b>It</b> has won numerous domestic and international awards and has been named among the greatest British children's television series of all time.|$|E
5|$|The {{eccentricity}} {{of their}} orbits causes regular flexing {{of the three}} moons' shapes, with Jupiter's gravity stretching them out as they <b>approach</b> <b>it</b> and allowing them to spring back to more spherical shapes as they swing away. This tidal flexing heats the moons' interiors by friction. This is seen most dramatically in the extraordinary volcanic activity of innermost Io (which {{is subject to the}} strongest tidal forces), and to a lesser degree in the geological youth of Europa's surface (indicating recent resurfacing of the moon's exterior).|$|E
5|$|The {{orbital motion}} of the Sirius binary system brings the two stars to a minimum angular {{separation}} of 3arcseconds and a maximum of 11arcseconds. At the closest <b>approach,</b> <b>it</b> is an observational challenge to distinguish the white dwarf from its more luminous companion, requiring a telescope with at least 300mm (12in) aperture and excellent seeing conditions. A periastron occurred in 1994 and the pair have since been moving apart, making them easier to separate with a telescope.|$|E

Discussing the relationship between anthropology and magic, Greenwood argues that it is impossible for anthropologists to truly understand beliefs regarding magic and the otherworld if they only view it through a western rationalist lens, instead arguing for a phenomenological or relativist perspective that accepts alternative views of the world.|$|E
5|$|At {{least three}} aspects of flowers {{appear to have}} coevolved between {{flowering}} plants and insects, because they involve communication between these organisms. Firstly, flowers communicate with their pollinators by scent; insects use this scent to determine how far away a flower is, to <b>approach</b> <b>it,</b> and to identify where to land and finally to feed. Secondly, flowers attract insects with patterns of stripes leading to the rewards of nectar and pollen, and colours such as blue and ultraviolet, to which their eyes are sensitive; in contrast, bird-pollinated flowers tend to be red or orange. Thirdly, flowers such as some orchids mimic females of particular insects, deceiving males into pseudocopulation.|$|E
5|$|At noon on 9 February, while {{cruising}} independently, Truxtun's men sighted a frigate off {{the coast}} of Nevis. Upon <b>approach</b> <b>it</b> was evident that the vessel was flying American colors, and Constellation attempted to move closer to investigate. The frigate was the French L'Insurgente under Michel-Pierre Barreaut. Approaching L'Insurgente, Truxtun signaled her to discern her nationality, first displaying British signals followed by the American signals. L'Insurgente replaced the American colors with the French and fired a gun, the purpose of which was unclear. Truxtun claimed L'Insurgente's shot was fired to windward to signal a fight, while Barreaut claimed he ordered the shot fired to leeward to signal that he wished to communicate. Regardless, Barreaut mistook the Constellation for a British warship and fled toward the Dutch islands of Saba and Sint Eustatius to escape, while Truxtun gave chase. By 1:30p.m. both ships had sailed into a gale. In the storm L'Insurgente was damaged and lost her main topmast. Constellation came through unscathed and continued to close on Barreaut.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{prolonged}} development {{period of the}} film, in 2010, DC Entertainment shifted focus onto developing a television series adaptation. Film director James Mangold pitched a series concept to cable channel HBO, whilst consulting with Gaiman himself on an unofficial basis, but this proved to be unsuccessful. It was reported in September 2010 that Warner Bros. Television was licensing the rights to produce a TV series, and that Supernatural creator Eric Kripke was their preferred candidate to adapt the saga. In March 2011, it was announced via Neil Gaiman's web blog that while he and DC liked Eric Kripke and his <b>approach,</b> <b>it</b> didn't feel quite right. The author hoped to launch the series in another form but plans for a television adaptation are on hold as production moves forward on the film. As the film adaptation of Morpheus' story was being planned, DC and Fox discussed in September about a possible TV series based on the Sandman character Lucifer.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November Soviet forces {{began to}} cross the Don River and {{continued}} their advance towards the town of Kalach. German forces defending Kalach, mostly composed of maintenance and supply personnel, {{were not aware of}} the Soviet offensive until 21 November, and even then did not know in what strength the Red Army was approaching. The task of taking the bridge at Kalach was given to the Soviet 26th Tank Corps, which used two captured German tanks and a reconnaissance vehicle to <b>approach</b> <b>it</b> and fire on the guards. Soviet forces broke into the town by mid-morning and drove the defenders out, allowing themselves and the 4th Tank Corps to link up with the Red Army's 4th Mechanized Corps approaching from the south. The encirclement of German forces in Stalingrad was completed on 22 November 1942. That day Soviet formations also continued to fight pockets of Romanian resistance, such as that put up by the Romanian 5th Corps.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman army did not {{march into}} Albania in one group. The first {{detachments}} to arrive were the Akıncı who marched through Dibra. Skanderbeg stalled this force's advance, but, once the main force arrived, the Albanians {{were not able}} to offer further resistance and withdrew. Realizing that both Ottoman commanders, Isak bey and Hamza, were familiar with the Albanian terrain and his tactics, Skanderbeg decided to adopt a new means of engagement. Normally, he would lure his enemy into a trap and then ambush them. His new tactic was very similar to his normal; however, he chose to <b>approach</b> <b>it</b> in a different manner. To make it impossible to be followed, Skanderbeg split his forces into several groups and ordered their respective commanders to march through the forests and mountains in different directions and to never assemble or assault the Ottomans unless instructed to do so. The Albanian warriors were supplied by the locals and supply depots set throughout the mountains as they marched.|$|E

5|$|The {{draw for}} the semi-finals meant Manchester City played the away leg first in every round, {{this time in}} Germany, where Schalke 04 were the opposition. Manchester City lost the first leg by a single goal. Needing to win at Maine Road by at least two goals, Manchester City used a very attacking <b>approach.</b> <b>It</b> worked; City led 3–0 at half-time, and won the match 5–1. In the final, City faced Górnik Zabrze of Poland, who had progressed via a coin toss after three matches with AS Roma could not produce a winner in the other semi-final.|$|E
5|$|Also {{noting the}} unachievable {{ambition}} {{of solving the}} conflict between naturalism and religion, Martin A Greenman, remarks that one must come to the book “with a certain mood”. Too critical a mood would blind the reader to its religious insights, while the sensitivity and depth of its philosophic insights would be lost {{if one were to}} <b>approach</b> <b>it</b> in a too enthusiastically religious mood. Greenman finishes by justifying Stace’s philosophy to logical positivists by quoting from Wittgenstein's Tractatus: “My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them….He must surmount these propositions: then he sees the world rightly” (6. 54.) Dorothy M. Emmet found issue with the notion that the mystical experience is the point of intersection between the temporal and eternal orders. She writes that there are difficulties in Stace defining these orders as two distinct “orders of being”, rather than just as a way of speaking, because this then means some statements about the temporal order are relevant to what is said about the eternal order and vice versa. Indeed, the interrelation between these two orders is difficult to maintain. She also questioned Stace’s characterisation of mystical consciousness as being the same everywhere.|$|E

Although Howard is initially hesitant to confide in Felton, he eventually surprises her by offering genuine words of comfort.

Later, the detectives get a call that Santa Claus has escaped from custody in the department, and he is found after falling through the ceiling and landing on Munch's desk. Meanwhile, Pembleton and Bayliss discuss the Watson murder scene. Bayliss insists he has already gone over the information repeatedly, but Pembleton tells him he needs to think outside the box and <b>approach</b> <b>it</b> with from the mind-frame of a criminal. Later, Bayliss reexamines the information and realizes the killer brought Watson down a fire escape, offering a new lead in the case.

5|$|In 1777, Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc {{introduced}} the Supremum Justitiæ Magistratum (Collegiate Tribunal of the Jury's Supreme Magistrate) {{in order to}} establish more separation of powers in judicial decisions. Giandonato Rogadeo, an eminent European jurist, was requested to come to Malta in 1781 by de Rohan to address issues related to common law. Rogadeo went on to author the Diritto Municipale, between the year of his arrival and 1784, a law book to be used for the Castellania. During his stay in Malta, he further observed that it was not the law which was just problematic but also the judges and advocates which were corrupt. His work was opposed by the advocates and judges, with Baron Gaetano Pisani and Judge Gio Nicoló Muscat anonymously publishing works in Rome in 1783 to challenge it and aiming to keep the status quo which had limited considerations. It became the primarily Maltese law of the Code de Rohan, a humane set of laws, which brought significant reformation to criminal law. The Code incorporated previous laws introduced from former Grand Masters with a more liberal <b>approach.</b> <b>It</b> also set standard regulations for advocates, with some flexibility. It was subsequently amended with the use of bandi. The Diritto Municipale was abolished in 1854, during the British period, and replaced by a more lenient Criminal Code.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to confuse the Russians, the {{combined}} fleet made a feint westward toward Odessa on 8 October before turning east to Kinburn. The combined French and British fleet arrived off Kinburn on 14 October. That night, a force of nine gunboats escorted transports carrying 8,000 men, led by François Achille Bazaine, who were landed behind the forts, further up the peninsula. The gunboat force was commanded by Rear Admiral Houston Stewart, who ordered his crews to hold their fire in the darkness unless {{they were able to}} clearly see a Russian target. The Russians did not launch a counterattack on the landing, allowing the French and British soldiers to dig trench positions while the gunboats shelled the main fort, albeit ineffectively. By the morning of the 17th, the soldiers had completed significant entrenchments, with French troops facing the fortifications and British troops manning the outward defences against a possible Russian attempt to relieve the garrison. By this time, the French had begun building sapping trenches, which then came under fire from the Russian fortress. In the meantime, {{on the night of the}} 16th, a French vessel had taken depth soundings close to the main fort to determine how closely the ships could <b>approach</b> <b>it.</b> Throughout this time, heavy seas prevented the fleet from launching a sustained bombardment of the Russian positions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seminal}} Court of Appeal {{decision}} Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the respondents submitted that the President's discretion under section 8(1) was subjective, {{and so was}} not open to review by the courts. The appellants argued that the discretion was objective, and thus {{a court of law}} could review the grounds on which the discretion had been exercised. The Court held that an objective test applied to the subjectively worded powers in sections 8 and 10, and hence the exercise of these powers was normally challengeable on the GCHQ grounds of judicial review. In coming to this decision, it disapproved of a 1971 High Court decision, Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs, which had held to the contrary. While the Court's views regarding the applicability of an objective test were obiter, later Singapore decisions have confirmed this as the correct <b>approach.</b> <b>It</b> gave several reasons for its decision. First, the reasoning in cases supporting a subjective test was found to be questionable, and, secondly, such a test was inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Finally, the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion was contrary {{to the rule of law}} and all powers had legal limits.|$|E
