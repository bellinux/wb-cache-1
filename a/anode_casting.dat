5000|$|The plant {{consists}} of a Teniente converter with electric furnace slag cleaning, three Pierce Smith converters, a rotary anode furnace and two reverbatory refining furnaces and two <b>anode</b> <b>casting</b> wheels. Capacity is 450,000 tonnes p.a. concentrate to produce 110,000 tonnes copper annually. Off gasses go to a Hugo Petersen sulphuric acid plant. [...] The refinery produces cathode copper, and gold, silver and selenium are produced from the anode slime {{left over from the}} refining process.|$|E
5000|$|From its inception, {{the copper}} smelter had been {{producing}} blister copper, originally {{for sale and}} then for refining at MIM's copper refinery in Townsville. This changed in June 1979, when two 320 tonne capacity rotary [...] "anode furnaces" [...] and a Mitsui-design <b>anode</b> <b>casting</b> wheel were commissioned in the Mount Isa smelter. The move to end exporting cold blister copper from the Mount Isa smelter resulted in substantial energy savings, because the anode furnaces received molten blister copper from the converters, meaning that cold blister copper {{did not have to}} be reheated and melted before being cast into anodes for electrolytic refining.|$|E
5000|$|The present mine is a {{conventional}} truck and shovel operation, {{with a large}} proportion of the ore crushed in-pit and transported by underground conveyors to the mill bins. The 182,000 tonnes p.a. concentrator is also conventional and is primary crushing followed by SAG mills and ball mills with cyclone classification. The flotation section produces both copper and molybdenum concentrates. [...] The 1.65 million tonnes p.a. of concentrate are smelted in one Outokumpu flash smelter and one Teniente converter with electric furnace and cylindrical slag cleaning followed by four Pierce Smith converters. The blister copper goes to six anode furnaces which feed three <b>anode</b> <b>casting</b> wheels. The anodes go on to the 855,000 tonnes p.a. electrolytic refinery.|$|E
50|$|Cathode rays {{themselves}} are invisible, but this accidental fluorescence allowed researchers {{to notice that}} objects in the tube {{in front of the}} cathode, such as the <b>anode,</b> <b>cast</b> sharp-edged shadows on the glowing back wall. In 1869, German physicist Johann Hittorf was first to realize that something must be traveling in straight lines from the cathode to cast the shadows. Eugen Goldstein named them cathode rays.|$|R

50|$|Copper anode casting: Special dam blocks {{which contain}} anode lug molds and a {{traveling}} hydraulic shear {{are added to}} the twin-belt casting machine to continuously cast net shape copper anodes. Anode width of approximately 1 meter (excluding lugs) and thicknesses from 16 mm to 45 mm. The primary advantage of this process is uniformity of the as-cast anode in terms of size and surface quality. <b>Anodes</b> <b>cast</b> using this process do not require additional preparation after casting.|$|R
5000|$|The copper {{is refined}} by electrolysis. The <b>anodes</b> <b>cast</b> from {{processed}} blister copper are placed into an aqueous solution of 3-4% copper sulfate and 10-16% sulfuric acid. Cathodes are thin rolled sheets of highly pure copper or, more commonly these days, reusable stainless steel starting sheets (as in the IsaKidd process). [...] A potential of only 0.2-0.4 volts {{is required for}} the process to commence. At the anode, copper and less noble metals dissolve. More noble metals such as silver, gold, selenium, and tellurium settle {{to the bottom of the}} cell as anode slime, which forms a salable byproduct. Copper(II) ions migrate through the electrolyte to the cathode. At the cathode, copper metal plates out, but less noble constituents such as arsenic and zinc remain in solution unless a higher voltage is used. The reactions are: ...|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Mines is {{conducting}} research to improve {{technology for the}} recovery of strategic and critical metals, such as cobalt, nickel, and chromium, that are lost in bulk and particulate superalloy-type scrap because {{it has not been}} possible to process mixed contaminated scrap efficiently. The research approach involves melting and casting mixed superalloy scrap into soluble anodes for electrodeposition of Ni-Co alloys by controlled-potential electrolysis. The initial experimental results described in this report are from electrolytic tests us-ing alloy <b>anodes</b> <b>cast</b> from elemental nickel, cobalt, and chromium, the main constituent metals of superalloys. Baseline data and operating parameters are necessary for Ni-Co and Ni-Co-Cr alloys before detailed experiments can be conducted on the more complex superalloy scrap. This basic research assessed the effects of cathode potential, S 04 :CI electrolyte ratio, electrolyte pH, stirring rate, deposition time, cathode current density, and chromium concentration on cathode current efficiency, alloy deposit composition, and deposition potential at a cell temperature of 5520 C...|$|R
50|$|Twin-belt {{continuous}} casting is a near net shape casting process, which significantly reduces {{the need for}} secondary rolling or forming operations.

40|$|Prior {{work at the}} Bureau of Mines {{resulted}} in the successful development of a bench-scale, combination electrorefining-electrowinning method for recycling the lead from scrap batteries using waste fluosilicic acid (H 2 SiF 6) as electrolyte. This paper describes larger scale experiments. <b>Anodes</b> <b>cast</b> from scrap battery lead were electrorefined in a 20 -L multielectrode cell for 3 to 7 days. The anodes, containing 2 to 2. 5 pct antimony, were ideal for obtaining firm and adherent slime blankets. Cathode deposits, assaying 99. 99 pct Pb, were obtained, with current efficiencies near 99 pct. Sludge leaching was done in 100 -L tanks followed by filtering in 61 cm square vacuum pan filtersu Lead of greater than 99. 99 -pct purity was recovered from the filtrate by electrowinning in a 20 -L multielectrode cell using insoluble Pb 02 -Ti (lead dioxide-coated titanium) anodes and pure lead cathodes. The fluo-silicic acid electrolyte depleted in lead was repeatedly recycled to leach more sludge, {{and there was no}} problem with impurity buildup. The amount of Pb 02 formed on the anodes during electrowinning was less than 1 pct of the total lead deposited on the cathodes, as long as the phosphorus concentration in the electrolyte was greater than 1. 3 giL. Emissions of lead in air were less than 10 ~g/m 3, well below the proposed OSHA limit of 50 ~g/m 3...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} a project, funded under a DOE SBIR grant, which {{tested a}} potentially lower cost {{method of manufacturing}} MCFC stack anodes and evaluated the feasibility of using the technology in the existing M-C Power Corp. manufacturing facility. The procedure involves adding activator salts to the <b>anode</b> tape <b>casting</b> slurry with the Ni and Cr or Al powders. Two different processes occur during heat treatment in a reducing environment: sintering of the base Ni structure, and alloying or cementation of the Cr or Al powders. To determine whether it was cost-effective to implement the cementation alloying manufacturing process, the M-C Power manufacturing cost model {{was used to determine}} the impact of different material costs and processing parameters on total anode cost. Cost analysis included equipment expenditures and facility modifications required by the cementation alloying process...|$|R
50|$|As {{barium sulfate}} has high burning point and is {{insoluble}} in water, {{it is used}} as a coating material in <b>casting</b> of copper <b>anode</b> plates. The <b>anode</b> plates are <b>cast</b> in copper molds, so to avoid the contact of the liquid copper and the solid copper mold, a solution of barium sulfate in water {{is used as a}} coating material on the mold surface. Thus when the liquid copper solidifies in form of an anode plate it can be easily released from its mold.|$|R
5000|$|The {{electrolyte}} {{for this}} process {{is a mixture of}} lead fluorosilicate (PbSiF6) and hexafluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6) operating at 45 °C (113 °F). Cathodes are thin sheets of pure lead and <b>anodes</b> are <b>cast</b> from the impure lead to be purified. A potential of 0.5 volts is applied. At the anode, lead dissolves into solution, as do metal impurities that are less noble than lead. Impurities that are more noble than lead, such as silver, gold, and bismuth, flake from the anode as it dissolves and settle {{to the bottom of the}} vessel as [...] "anode mud." [...] Pure metallic lead plates onto the cathode, with the less noble metals remaining in solution. Because of the high cost of electrolysis, {{this process is}} used only when very pure lead is needed. Otherwise pyrometallurgical methods are preferred, such as the Parkes process followed by the Betterton-Kroll process.|$|R

50|$|The {{change to}} the lance-based furnace {{increased}} oxygen utilization to 95% and the cycle time {{was reduced to a}} little less than eight hours, “but the grade of the doré which could be economically produced was poor.” The doré from the new furnace still contained about 0.8% lead and 0.4% copper. It was also found impractical to <b>cast</b> <b>anode</b> plates of doré directly from the Sirosmelt furnace, so the Sirosmelt doré had to undergo a further refining step in a reverberatory furnace, together with a sodium nitrate flux.|$|R

La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2 FeO 3 (LSF 20) powders for cathode and 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) powders for electrolyte were synthesized through glycine-nitrate process (GNP). The slurries for cathode, electrolyte and <b>anode</b> (NiO-YSZ) were <b>cast</b> in sequence to form green PEN structures.

50|$|An {{electrolytic}} {{process is the}} use of electrolysis industrially to refine metals or compounds at a high purity and low cost. Some examples are the Hall-Héroult process used for aluminium, or the production of hydrogen from water. Electrolysis is usually done in bulk using hundreds of sheets of metal connected to an electric power source. In the production of copper, these pure sheets of copper are used as starter material for the cathodes, and are then lowered into a solution such as copper sulfate with the large <b>anodes</b> that are <b>cast</b> from impure (97% pure) copper. The copper from the anodes are electroplated on to the cathodes, while any impurities settle {{to the bottom of the}} tank. This forms cathodes of 99.999% pure copper.|$|R
40|$|The present {{technological}} {{cycle to}} produce secondary copper includes two main steps: a preliminary thermal refining to produce <b>cast</b> <b>anodes</b> having a copper content of about 99 %, followed by anode electrorefining to produce HSG copper. The new proposed process avoids the pyro-refining operation and produces anodes by cold compacting of granulated copper and copper alloy scrap. The direct electrorefining presents economical and environmental advantages due to furnace exclusion, {{but also to}} the possibility of using low-grade scrap. Once the electrorefining has been tested on a laboratory scale by using parameters similar to those used in traditional operations, the main critical aspects of the process have been analyzed. In particular technology of anode production, best scrap size, compacting parameters, anodic scrap residue and electrolyte purification process have been tested on a laboratory pilot plant...|$|R
40|$|Our planar SOFC {{stacking}} technology uses unprofiled metallic interconnects (MIC) {{and thin}} cells of tape <b>cast</b> <b>anode</b> supported YSZ. The key element is the gas diffusion layer (GDL) between cell and MIC, {{which consists of}} so-called SOFConnex™. Using square cells with internal manifolds, 0. 5 W/cm 2 stack power density (800 °C) can be obtained on short stacks. However, this open design configuration limits the assembly of large stacks and the durability of operation, owing to postcombustion and redox cycling occurring at unprotected cell edges. A new design, inspired from modeling work and the adaptability of the SOFConnex™ GDL, led to oblong-shaped cells, assembled in a closed stack casing with external air manifolding and fuel recovery manifolding, avoiding postcombustion. While stack power density in both designs remains similar, the operation at increased fuel utilization has become more stable in the 2 nd design. Furthermore, a correlation of performance homogeneity during stack testing was drawn to assembly quality control. A 36 -cell stack in dilute H 2 at 800 °C achieved 625 Wel (28 % LHV efficiency, 0. 35 W/cm 2) under continuous polarisation, with all 6 clusters of 6 cells showing coincident i-V-output...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} Phase II of this program, 'Low-Cost Manufacturing Of Multilayer Ceramic Fuel Cells'. The objective {{of the program is}} to develop advanced ceramic manufacturing technologies for making planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) components that are more economical and reliable for a variety of applications. Phase II development work focused on three distinct manufacturing approaches (or tracks) for planar solid oxide fuel cell elements. Two development tracks, led by NexTech Materials and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, involved co-sintering of planar SOFC elements of cathode-supported and anode-supported variations. A third development track, led by the University of Missouri-Rolla, focused on a revolutionary approach for reducing operating temperature of SOFCs by using spin-coating to deposit ultra-thin, nano-crystalline YSZ electrolyte films. The work in Phase II was supported by characterization work at Ohio State University. The primary technical accomplishments within each of the three development tracks are summarized. Track 1 [...] NexTech's targeted manufacturing process for planar SOFC elements involves tape casting of porous electrode substrates, colloidal-spray deposition of YSZ electrolyte films, co-sintering of bi-layer elements, and screen printing of opposite electrode coatings. The bulk of NexTech's work focused on making cathode-supported elements, although the processes developed at NexTech also were applied to the fabrication of anode-supported cells. Primary accomplishments within this track are summarized below: (1) Scale up of lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) cathode powder production process; (2) Development and scale-up of tape casting methods for cathode and anode substrates; (3) Development of automated ultrasonic-spray process for depositing YSZ films; (4) Successful co-sintering of flat bi-layer elements (both cathode and anode supported); (5) Development of anode and cathode screen-printing processes; and (6) Demonstration of novel processes for composite cathode and cermet anode materials. Track 2 [...] ORNL's development work focused solely on making anode-supported planar cells by tape casting of a porous anode substrate, screen printing of a YSZ electrolyte film, co-sintering of the bi-layer element, and screen-printing of an opposite cathode coating.
