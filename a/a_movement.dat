5|$|In {{the context}} of a PPF, {{opportunity}} cost {{is directly related to the}} shape of the curve (see below). If the shape of the PPF curve is a straight-line, the opportunity cost is constant as production of different goods is changing. But, opportunity cost usually will vary depending on the start and end points. In the diagram on the right, producing 10 more packets of butter, at a low level of butter production, costs the loss of 5 guns (shown as <b>a</b> <b>movement</b> from A to B). At point C, the economy is already close to its maximum potential butter output. To produce 10 more packets of butter, 50 guns must be sacrificed (as with <b>a</b> <b>movement</b> from C to D). The ratio of gains to losses is determined by the marginal rate of transformation.|$|E

I decided to make a case study in which a hypoactive student was included. Through observations and recording changes at integrating <b>a</b> creative <b>movement</b> in the classroom, positive effects of <b>a</b> creative <b>movement</b> on <b>a</b> hypoactive student were noticed.

Despite his defeat, Adams continued to work for amendments to the Constitution, <b>a</b> <b>movement</b> that ultimately resulted in the addition of a Bill of Rights in 1791. Adams subsequently became a firm supporter of the Constitution, with these amendments and the possibility of more.|$|E
