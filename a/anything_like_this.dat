The Executive Director of Saint Francis House, Karen LaFrazia, {{said that this}} was a very rare occurrence and that in her tenure of more than a decade, she had never seen <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> and that the environment is safe and a haven for many hundreds of people every day. The people involved in the incident were not regular guests of Saint Francis House.|$|E

500|$|On May 30, 2015, Illinois's other senator, Dick Durbin, a Democrat, stated: [...] "It {{seems so}} out of {{character}} for Denny. I just never could imagine that he'd be involved in <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> ... We had our political differences, as you might expect, but I respected him as a colleague in the Illinois delegation and as Speaker." ...|$|E

5000|$|Communist Party USA {{sponsored}} {{and participated}} in the rally, and Sam Webb, CPUSA national chair, said, [...] "There's never been <b>anything</b> quite <b>like</b> <b>this</b> march. The great {{thing is that it}} happened, who was there, who spoke, the spirit and politics." ...|$|R
500|$|Microsoft {{prepared}} {{what was}} described as a [...] "mammoth" [...] advertising campaign for the game, with Entertainment Director Stephen McGill affirming that the game [...] "is absolutely a key title to us ... {{this is the first time}} we've ever done <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> and Halo 3: ODST is a great way to kick it off." [...] Numerous promotional materials were released through Xbox Live, and many more via online and television advertising. Marvel Comics published a limited comic series, Helljumper, featuring ODSTs main characters.|$|E
500|$|Indian firm Prasad EFX {{assigned}} {{a team of}} more than 100 VFX specialists to work with Marc Kolbe and Craig Mumma to create the visual effects for the film. Included were sophisticated 3D modelling and computer animation, including whole body scans, 3D replicas of vehicles, fire sequences, complicated wire removals and compositing work. They prepared over 1,200 VFX shots, accounting for approximately 90 minutes of screen time. Describing the effects, Rakesh Roshan stated, [...] "If you liked the visual effects in Koi... Mil Gaya, you will find them far better in Krrish. I do not think audiences have seen <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> in Hindi films." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the band}} ended its brief tour {{in support of}} Tweez, most of its members {{attended}} college. Around this time McMahan and Walford began writing together for the band's next record, creating six new songs which the band practiced throughout the summer of 1990. Slint entered River North Records in August 1990 to record Spiderland. At that time there were no vocals or lyrics prepared for the album, so the band wrote them while in the studio. The album's producer, Brian Paulson, {{was known for his}} [...] "live" [...] recording style in the studio, with minimal takes. Paulson recalled [...] "It was weird while I was doing [...] because I remember sitting there, and I just knew there was something about it. I've never heard <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> I'm really digging this but it's really fucking weird." ...|$|E

500|$|Litigation, {{ultimate}} {{roll call}} of damage, and {{the scope of}} final insurance recovery were all unknown , with analysts reporting that the aftermath was of unprecedented scale and complexity compared to previous disasters which themselves took many years to unfold and resolve. A July 2010 analysis by the Financial Times on the aftermath cited legal sources as saying that [...] "at some point {{the scale of the}} litigation becomes so large that it really is novel", that [...] "the situation is likely to be complicated further because the variety of probable cases means {{it will be hard to}} aggregate them into so-called class actions" [...] and that there was [...] "no way to put this in historical context because we have never faced <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> before". As with the Exxon Valdez disaster, litigation was being discussed in terms of a 20-year timescale.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the success of Frozen, {{director}} Chris Buck stated: [...] "We never expected <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> We just hoped {{to make a movie}} that did as well as Tangled! I hoped the audience would embrace it and respond to it, but there's no way we could have predicted this." [...] He cited a number of reasons for the film's popularity: [...] "There are characters that people relate to; the songs are so strong and memorable. We also have some flawed characters, which is what Jen and I like to do– we essentially create two imperfect princesses." [...] As Frozen approached the first anniversary of its release, Menzel mentioned the film's continuing popularity in an October 2014 interview: [...] "It’s just a remarkable thing. Usually you do a project and it has its moment. This just feels like it keeps going." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} {{tracks for}} her greatest hits compilation, Greatest Hits – Chapter One, Clarkson began discussing with her record label RCA Records about plans for her sixth studio album being a Christmas release in late 2012, {{during which she}} also began to write original Christmas material. Greg Kurstin, whom she had previously collaborated with, was approached by Clarkson to produce the album; and together, they co-wrote the tracks [...] "Underneath the Tree" [...] and [...] "4 Carats". [...] "Underneath the Tree" [...] was produced by Kurstin, who also played most of the instruments, including a mellotron and a Chamberlin, to evoke a Phil Spector's Wall of Sound treatment—a sound that Billboard and HitFix noticed upon hearing the song. He also had Clarkson provide all the voices in it, including all its backing vocals. She recalled the experience as new, stating, [...] "I've never had to do <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> before—doing all my backup vocals, essentially being my own choir." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "My God is Paul Newman a good actor," [...] said John Huston. [...] ""He's just {{marvelous}} in this picture. He's {{never done}} <b>anything</b> quite <b>like</b> <b>this</b> and yet he's caught something unique and original. The picture definitely {{says something about}} a spirit of the past. There's something uniquely American about the judge." ...|$|R
5000|$|Former Red Sox player Troy O'Leary {{was interviewed}} and stated he didn't {{remember}} the incident. [...] "I remember the normal union meetings {{in spring training}} where they'd talk about drugs and steroids, and I remember doctors talking negatively about them, but I don't remember ever hearing <b>anything</b> <b>like,</b> 'OK, <b>this</b> {{is the right way}} to do steroids.' If that happened, I missed that one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{have slept}} all night, captain. I say, isn't this tremendous? I {{did not think}} <b>anything</b> could be <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> It is splendid, you know, but it takes one's breath away.|$|R
500|$|As {{the crews}} passed the HMS Stork {{training}} ship, Cambridge began {{to draw away}} and were two lengths ahead by Chiswick Steps. [...] With a strong tailwind along Corney Reach, the Light Blues continued to pull ahead and passed below Barnes Bridge four lengths ahead, and six seconds ahead of the course record. [...] Cambridge passed the finishing post five lengths ahead {{in a time of}} 17 minutes 50 seconds. [...] The victory, Cambridge's second in a row, and third in the last four races, took the overall record in the race to 5043 in their favour. [...] The special correspondent writing in The Observer called it [...] "the maddest Boat Race for years". [...] The Times rowing correspondent suggested it was [...] "a great triumph for the Cambridge coaches, who so often seem able to produce something out of the bag which has not been apparent in practice." [...] Writing in The Manchester Guardian, the rowing correspondent noted that it was [...] "strange that Cambridge had never shown <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> form in practice".|$|E
500|$|To prevent similar occurrences {{happening}} in future game telecasts, a special [...] "Heidi phone", a hotline {{connected to a}} different exchange and unaffected by switchboard meltdowns, was installed in BOC. The network quickly changed its procedures to allow games to finish before other programming begins, which is now standard practice. Three weeks after the Heidi Game, NBC aired a special presentation of Pinocchio (a live-action version starring Peter Noone, the lead singer of the rock band Herman's Hermits, in the title role). In the promotional newspaper advertisement for the film, Pinocchio himself assured football fans that they would view the entire game before the film {{and that he would}} sooner cut off his nose than [...] "have them cut off" [...] the action. On December 15, the nationally televised game between the Raiders and the San Diego Chargers ran over its allotted time slot. NBC started The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (the usual program airing at 7 p.m. EST) at 7:08 Eastern, and announced that all network programming that evening would be started eight minutes late. [...] "I can't remember when we've done <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> before", stated an NBC executive. [...] "It's very unusual." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{providing}} instrumentation for the record, Kurstin {{used all}} of his instruments, such as a Mellotron and a Chamberlin, taping them from a distance to simulate the Wall of Sound, a recording technique originally developed by Phil Spector that was popular in the early 1960s. He enlisted Clarkson to provide all the background vocals herself. Clarkson, who grew up singing in a choir, {{was pleased with the}} aspect, saying: [...] "Blending is something I knew how to do from childhood. Sometimes I'd have to do an alto instead of a soprano because they needed a bigger sound. But I've never had to do <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> before—doing all my backup vocals, essentially being my own choir." [...] Together, they began to record in May 2013 and continued through the summer of that year, beginning by recording [...] "White Christmas" [...] with Clarkson in the vocal booth and with Kurstin on a piano. She commented: [...] "The production is all him. I would be just like 'Hey, can we make this more jazz? Hey, can we make this more bluesy. And he just, like Harry Potter, made this happen. It's so weird." ...|$|E
5000|$|Lucy Powell, the Labour campaign's vice-chair, {{was widely}} {{thought to have}} {{committed}} a gaffe about the stone, when she said on Radio 5 Live: [...] "I don't think anyone is suggesting {{that the fact that}} he's carved them in stone means he's absolutely not going to break them or <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that". <b>This</b> was particularly damaging as {{the whole point of the}} stone had been to underline the seriousness of Miliband's commitment.|$|R

500|$|Stephen Holden of The New York Times {{referred}} to the film as [...] "Alternately gripping and laughable" [...] and that [...] "The scenes of gore and destruction are even more spectacular than Hong Kong's fog-shrouded skyline". Variety gave a positive review, describing the film as an [...] "extremely violent and superbly made actioner demonstrates the tight grasp that director John Woo has on the crime meller genre". Kathleen Maher of The Austin Chronicle praised the film stating that it [...] "defies all categorization but demands comparisons, if only to prove that there's never been <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> before." [...] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote a positive review, describing the film as [...] "like eating popcorn, but it's not just any old brand; it's escape-velocity popcorn, popcorn with a slurp of rocket fuel... ideas overreach themselves with such a virile swagger that they border on comedy. With excess like this you can't help but laugh. This is a rush of a movie". The Christian Science Monitor gave the film a mixed review, stating that [...] "This violent Hong Kong thriller has more psychological depth than most of its kind, but ultimately seems like a pointless exercise in style".|$|E
500|$|While her {{steering}} {{was being}} repaired in Malta, the Illustrious was bombed again on 16 January by 17 Junkers Ju 88 medium bombers and 44 Stukas. The pilots of 806 Squadron {{claimed to have}} shot down two of the former and possibly damaged another pair, but a 500kg bomb penetrated her flight deck aft of the rear lift and detonated in the captain's day cabin; several other bombs nearly hit the ship but only caused minor damage. Two days later, one of three Fulmars that intercepted an Axis air raid on the Maltese airfields was shot down with no survivors. Only one Fulmar was serviceable on 19 January, when the carrier was attacked several times and it was shot down. Illustrious was not struck during these attacks but was near-missed several times and the resulting shock waves from their detonations dislodged enough hull plating to cause an immediate 5-degree list, cracked the cast-iron foundations of her port turbine, and damaged other machinery. The naval historian J. D. Brown noted that [...] "There {{is no doubt that}} the armoured deck saved her from destruction; no other carrier took <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> level of punishment and survived." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Indestructible" [...] was {{directed}} by Max Vitali and Nils Ljunggren. Vitali had previously worked with Robyn on the music videos for [...] "Hang with Me" [...] and [...] "Dancing on My Own". For the video, Australian artist Lucy McRae, who makes [...] "body architecture", designed a special [...] "tube dress" [...] for Robyn to wear. McRae also designed the outfits Robyn wore on the Body Talk album covers. The dress for the video {{was made up of}} plastic pipes that were periodically filled with colored fluids and wrapped around Robyn's body. Robyn recalled that the machine that kept the liquid flowing was [...] "very complicated". It was powered by drills and required [...] "a whole lot of complex machinery to function". The machine was built by McRae, who had to do it quickly because of the video's budget. McRae said, [...] "Me and the dream team had never done <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> before, the whole project was happening for the first time. The machine was super loud." [...] The shooting stopped four times due to leaks, and the team had to mop and re-set the technology. The shooting took twenty hours, and by 3 a.m. McRae said that Robyn was wrapped [...] "in a kilometre of tubing draped over her head and body". She praised Robyn's stamina throughout the shoot, saying that [...] "there were chaotic moments that could have been potentially disastrous and the entire time Robyn was working with us, smiling, moving when the tubes were stuck and just super happy we were making it happen." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, Rasher {{was asked}} by Jameson to do a {{commercial}} commission. He has since completed many paintings for the brand. On the commission, Rasher had the following to say, [...] "I had never done <b>anything</b> else <b>like</b> <b>this</b> before and I will try anything once. It's a 200 year old brand and I am a 28 year-old man so I liked the contrast between old and new." ...|$|R

However, he told Florida Today, [...] "people shouldn't {{have to go through}} that and shouldn't answer to innuendos".

2500|$|Cave's novel The Death of Bunny Munro, {{published}} in 2009, was released as an audiobook and Cave worked with Ellis, Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard on the soundtrack.

2500|$|Sharmila Tagore {{said in an}} {{interview}} to The Indian Express that [...] "women came out in droves to see Kaka.

He needed police protection when he was in public. I have never seen <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> before or since." ...|$|E
5000|$|In GQ, Jen Ortiz {{called it}} [...] "surreal" [...] and [...] "hilarious". Sydney Bucksbaum of Zap2it wrote that viewers should watch {{it with an}} open mind, {{discarding}} expectations and inhibitions, because [...] "you have never seen <b>anything</b> quite <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> and you probably won't ever see <b>anything</b> quite <b>like</b> it again". Bradford Evans of Splitsider called its pacing stand-out and its blending of horror and comedy exceptionally unique, writing that it was [...] "genuinely suspenseful and frightening in parts". In LA Weekly, Liz Ohanesian compared its pacing to Eagleheart, making for plot twists [...] "more bizarre than an audience member can anticipate".|$|R
