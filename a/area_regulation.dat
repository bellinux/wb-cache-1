BACKGROUND: In July and August of 2012, the County adopted its revised critical <b>areas</b> <b>regulations,</b> and made changes to the existing critical <b>areas</b> <b>regulations</b> so that they only apply to agricultural uses. The Thurston County Farm Bureau appealed the regulations to the Growth Management Hearings Board. The County and the Farm Bureau {{have been working on}} a negotiated settlement since November 2012. The lawsuit is on hold pending the results of the negotiations. In mid April, the County sent the Farm Bureau representative final proposed changes. The Farm Bureau representative sent their response to the County’s proposed changes in late May 2013. Staff has agreed to take the proposed changes to the Planning Commission and the Board of County Commissioners for their review. ...|$|R
40|$|Cells are {{wrapped in}} inelastic membranes, yet they can sustain large {{mechanical}} strains by regulating their area. The <b>area</b> <b>regulation</b> in cells is achieved either by membrane folding or by membrane exo- and endocytosis. These processes involve complex morphological transformations {{of the cell}} membrane, i. e., invagination, vesicle fusion, and fission, whose precise mechanisms are still under debate. Here we provide mechanistic insights into the <b>area</b> <b>regulation</b> of cell membranes, based on the previously neglected role of membrane confinement, {{as well as on}} the strain-induced membrane tension. Commonly, the membranes of mammalian and plant cells are not isolated, but rather they are adhered to an extracellular matrix, the cytoskeleton, and to other cell membranes. Using a lipid bilayer, coupled to an elastic sheet, we are able to demonstrate that, upon straining, the confined membrane is able to regulate passively its area. In particular, by stretching the elastic support, the bilayer laterally expands without rupture by fusing adhered lipid vesicles; upon compression, lipid tubes grow out of the membrane plane, thus reducing its area. These transformations are reversible, as we show using cycles of expansion and compression, and closely reproduce membrane processes found in cells during <b>area</b> <b>regulation.</b> Moreover, we demonstrate a new mechanism for the formation of lipid tubes in cells, which is driven by the membrane lateral compression and may therefore explain the various membrane tubules observed in shrinking cells...|$|E

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{a high-level}} {{analysis of the}} benefit and cost for flywheel energy storage used to provide <b>area</b> <b>regulation</b> for the electricity supply and transmission system in California. <b>Area</b> <b>regulation</b> is an 'ancillary service' needed for a reliable and stable regional electricity grid. The analysis was based on results from a demonstration, in California, of flywheel energy storage developed by Beacon Power Corporation (the system's manufacturer). Demonstrated was flywheel storage systems ability to provide 'rapid-response' regulation. Flywheel storage output can be varied much more rapidly than the output from conventional regulation sources, making flywheels more attractive than conventional regulation resources. The performance of the flywheel storage system demonstrated was generally consistent with requirements for a possible new class of regulation resources - 'rapid-response' energy-storage-based regulation - in California. In short, it was demonstrated that Beacon Power Corporation's flywheel system follows a rapidly changing control signal (the ACE, which changes every four seconds). Based on the results and on expected plant cost and performance, the Beacon Power flywheel storage system {{has a good chance}} of being a financially viable regulation resource. Results indicate a benefit/cost ratio of 1. 5 to 1. 8 using what may be somewhat conservative assumptions. A benefit/cost ratio of one indicates that, based on the financial assumptions used, the investment's financial returns just meet the investors target...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the link between}} cell movement and plasma membrane recycling using a fast-acting, temperature-sensitive mutant of the Dictyostelium SecA exocytic protein. Strikingly, most mutant cells become almost paralysed within minutes at the restrictive temperature. However, they can still sense cyclic-AMP (cAMP) gradients and polymerise actin up-gradient, but form only abortive pseudopodia, which cannot expand. They also relay a cAMP signal normally, suggesting that cAMP is released by a non-exocytic mechanism. To investigate why SecA is required for motility, we examined membrane trafficking in the mutant. Plasma membrane circulation is rapidly inhibited at the restrictive temperature and the cells acquire a prominent vesicle. Organelle-specific markers show {{that this is an}} undischarged contractile vacuole, and we found the cells are correspondingly osmo-sensitive. Electron microscopy shows that many smaller vesicles, probably originating from the plasma membrane, also accumulate at the restrictive temperature. Consistent with this, the surface area of mutant cells shrinks. We suggest that SecA mutant cells cannot move at the restrictive temperature because their block in exocytosis results in a net uptake of plasma membrane, reducing its area, and so restricting pseudopodial expansion. This demonstrates the importance of proper surface <b>area</b> <b>regulation</b> in cell movement...|$|E
