40|$|Over {{the last}} 3 decades, {{there has been}} a {{resurgence}} of interest in large-scale production of fermentation chemicals due to the sharp increase in petroleum cost. So the potential role of a new energy efficient fermentation technology is receiving growing attention. Carboxylic acids like as propionic, lactic, citric, tartaric acid etc. have been used as the most efficient fermentation chemicals. Propionic <b>acid</b> <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>fermentation</b> is widely used in chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries. It is used primarily for animal feed preservation, including hay, silage, and grains, and in human foods, mainly in baked goods and cheeses. The growing demand of this acid draws attention towards the more economical energy efficient technology. The conventional method of recovery of the propionic acid is expensive and unfriendly to the environment as it consumes lime and sulphuric acid and also produces a large quantity of calcium sulphate sludge as solid waste. Thus {{there is a need to}} look at other methods of producing propionic acid. Reactive extraction with specified extractant giving a higher distribution coefficient has been emerged as a promising technique for the recovery of acids.

Reactive extraction with specified extractant giving a higher distribution coefficient has been emerged as a promising technique for the recovery of acids. For the design of extraction process, equilibrium data of extractant is required to select a proper extractant for reactive extraction. In the present work equilibrium study for the reactive extraction of propionic acid is carried out. Various diluents and extractants are used for equilibrium studies and data are presented in terms of distribution coefficient and equilibrium complexation constant. On the basis of higher distribution coefficient and equilibrium complexation constant, the best combination of diluent extractant is suggested. In physical equilibria, distribution coefficient (KD = 2. 14) with 1 -octanol is maximum at concentration of 5 % (v/v). Distribution coefficient(K D = 2. 3) is enhanced with Aliquat 336 (10 %) in 1 -octanol for the reactive extraction of propionic acid.

40|$|The {{content of}} ruminally {{fermented}} OM {{in the diet}} affects the fiber requirement of dairy cattle. Physi-cally effective fiber is the fraction of feed that stimu-lates chewing activity. Chewing, in turn, stimulates saliva secretion. Bicarbonate and phosphate buffers in saliva neutralize <b>acids</b> <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>fermentation</b> of OM in the rumen. The balance between the produc-tion of fermentation acid and buffer secretion is {{a major determinant of}} ruminal pH. Low ruminal pH may decrease DMI, fiber digestibility, and microbial yield and thus decrease milk production and increase feed costs. Diets should be formulated to maintain adequate mean ruminal pH, and variation in ruminal pH should be minimized by feeding management. The fraction of OM that is fermented in the rumen varies greatly among diets. This variation affects the amount of fermentation <b>acids</b> <b>produced</b> and directly affects the amount of physically effective fiber that is required to maintain adequate ruminal pH. Acid production in the rumen is due primarily to fermenta-tion of carbohydrates, which represent over 65 % of the DM in diets of dairy cows and have the most variable ruminal degradation across diets. The non-fiber carbohydrate content of the diet is often used as a proxy for ruminal fermentability, but this measure is inadequate. Ruminal fermentation of both nonfiber carbohydrate and fiber is extremely variable, and this variability is not related to the nonfiber carbohydrate content of the diet. The interaction of ruminally fer-mented carbohydrate and physically effective fiber must be considered when diets for dairy cattle are evaluated and formulated.

Aristotle thought sweet, soft figs decayed the teeth. Hippo crates held "humors of the body " responsible for caries. Pliny recom mended cleaning the teeth to prevent their decay. The Romans advocated the use of tooth picks and dentifrices, as did the Arabians. In the middle ages caries was attributed to a "worm in the tooth. " In 1728 horse hair tooth brushes were condemned as harmful by the French. Thomas Berd-mon, dentist to King George III, advocated soft tooth powder to clean the teeth and for the prevention of caries. Westcott, in 1843, showed that acids originated from fermentation and thought that such acids dissolved the enamel and produced caries. Harris, in 1853, and Tomes, in 1873, ascribed caries to <b>acids</b> <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>fermentations.</b> Miller (1) advanced his important parasite theory, and claimed that organisms in the mouth act on carbohydrate materials and by a process of fermentation form lactic, butyric, acetic, and other acids which destroy the enamel.

40|$|Thermococcus strain ES- 1 is a {{strictly}} anaerobic, hyperthermophilic archaeon that grows at temperatures up to 91 degrees C <b>by</b> the <b>fermentation</b> of peptides. It is obligately dependent upon elemental sulfur (S(o)) for growth, which it reduces to H 2 S. Cell extracts contain high aldehyde oxidation activity with viologen dyes as electron acceptors. The enzyme responsible, which we term aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase (AOR), has been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. AOR is a homodimeric protein with a subunit M(r) of approximately 67, 000. It contains molybdopterin and one W, {{four to five}} Fe, one Mg, and two P atoms per subunit. Electron paramagnetic resonance analyses of the reduced enzyme indicated {{the presence of a}} single [4 Fe- 4 S]+ cluster with an S = 3 / 2 ground state. While AOR oxidized a wide range of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes, those with the highest apparent kcat/Km values (> 10 microM- 1 S- 1) were acetaldehyde, isovalerylaldehyde, and phenylacetaldehyde (Km values of < 100 microM). The apparent Km value for Thermococcus strain ES- 1 ferredoxin was 10 microM (with crotonaldehyde as the substrate). Thermococcus strain ES- 1 AOR also catalyzed the reduction of acetate (apparent Km of 1. 8 mM) below pH 6. 0 (with reduced methyl viologen as the electron donor) but at much less than 1 % of the rate of the oxidative reaction (with benzyl viologen as the electron acceptor at pH 6. 0 to 10. 0). The properties of Thermococcus strain ES- 1 AOR are very similar to those of AOR previously purified from the saccharolytic hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus, in which AOR was proposed to oxidize glyceraldehyde as part of a novel glycolytic pathway (S. Mukund and M. W. W. Adams, J. Biol. Chem. 266 : 14208 - 14216, 1991). However, Thermococcus strain ES- 1 is not known to metabolize carbohydrates, and glyceraldehyde was a very poor substrate (kcat/Km of < 0. 2 microM- 1 S- 1) for its AOR. The most efficient substrates for Thermococcus strain ES- 1 AOR were the aldehyde derivatives of transaminated amino acids. This suggests that the enzyme functions to oxidize aldehydes generated during amino acid catabolism, although the possibility that AOR generates aldehydes from organic <b>acids</b> <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>fermentation</b> cannot be ruled out...|$|R

When cells were anaerobically cultured {{in a medium}} containing 6. 5 g/L glycerol, a high succinic acid yield (133 %) was obtained while avoiding the for-mation of by-product acetic acid. The gram ratio of suc-cinic acid to acetic acid was 25. 8 : 1, which is 6. 5 times higher than that obtained using glucose (ca. 4 : 1) as a carbon source. Therefore, succinic <b>acid</b> can be <b>produced</b> with much less by-product formation by using glycerol as a carbon source, which will facilitate its purification. When glucose and glycerol were cofermented with the increasing ratio of glucose to glycerol, the gram ratio of succinic acid to acetic acid and succinic acid yield de-creased, suggesting that glucose enhanced acetic acid formation irrespective {{of the presence of}} glycerol. Glyc-erol consumption by A. succiniciproducens required un-identified nutritional components present in yeast ex-tract.

The optimization was done by performing an attainable region analysis on the system. Two different process designs was evaluated. In the first design, there were two separate fermentation networks, and the outlet flows were mixed and fed to the esterification reactor. In the second design, butanol was <b>produced</b> separately <b>by</b> <b>fermentation.</b> The outlet flow consisted of both substrate and butanol. It was fed to a reactor where butyric <b>acid</b> was <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>fermentation,</b> and simultaneously converted to butyl butyrate.

A possible reason for this deviation, is that the product inhibition of the cells which are <b>producing</b> butyric <b>acid</b> are reduced in the second process design. This is due to that butyric acid is reacting with the butanol to form butyl butyrate, hence, the concentration of butyric acid is maintained at low values.

Samples were immersed in four different groups of artificial saliva based on the pH, in which the first group was immersed in artificial saliva pH 4, the second in pH 6, the third in pH 8, and the fourth group was immersed in distilled water (pH 7). The results showed that after 7 day of immersion, {{there was a significant difference}} on solubility levels between the four groups of treatment (p< 0. 05). The data were tabulated and analyzed using one-way ANOVA and least significant difference (LSD). Therefore, it can be concluded that pH can affect the solubility levels of Cavit temporary filling...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinically}} used beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic <b>acid</b> is <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>fermentation</b> of Streptomyces clavuligerus. The orf 6 gene of the {{clavulanic acid}} biosynthetic gene cluster in S. clavuligerus encodes a protein that shows sequence homology to ornithine acetyltransferase (OAT), the fifth enzyme of the arginine biosynthetic pathway. Orf 6 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli (at approximately 15 % of total soluble protein by SDS/PAGE analysis) indicating {{it was not}} toxic to the host cells. The recombinant protein was purified (to > 95 % purity) by a one-step technique. Like other OATs it was synthesized as a precursor protein which underwent autocatalytic internal cleavage in E. coli to generate alpha and beta subunits. Cleavage was shown to occur between the alanine and threonine residues in a KGXGMXXPX [...] (M/L) AT (M/L) L motif conserved within all identified OAT sequences. Gel filtration and native electrophoresis analyses implied that the ORF 6 protein was an alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetramer and direct evidence for this came from mass spectrometric analyses. Although anomalous migration of the beta subunit was observed by standard SDS/PAGE analysis, which indicated the presence of two bands (as previously observed for other OATs), mass spectrometric analyses did not reveal any evidence for post-translational modification of the beta subunit. Extended denaturation with SDS before PAGE resulted in observation of a single major beta subunit band. Purified ORF 6 was able to catalyse the reversible transfer of an acetyl group from N-acetylornithine to glutamate, but not the formation of N-acetylglutamate from glutamate and acetyl-coenzyme A, nor (detectably) the hydrolysis of N-acetylornithine. Mass spectrometry also revealed the reaction proceeds via acetylation of the beta subunit...|$|R

The main {{objective of this}} study was to increase the level of clavulanic acid production from Streptomyces clavuligerus (DSM 738), using UV irradiation. After incubation, the spores and aerial mycelia were scraped off the agar plate by a sterile loop. After passing through a cotton wool, the serially diluted spore suspension was spread on GYM- agar containing caffeine. The plates were irradiated with UV light, wrapped in aluminum foil and incubated. The colonies were sub-cultured again to express the mutations. An aliquot of the spore suspension prepared from the resulted culture was poured in GYM agar plates and incubated. The plates were overlaid with nutrient-agar containing penicillin G and Klebsiela pneumoniae, and incubated. The inhibition zone diameter was measured and compared with the wild type colony. Repeating this procedure, the overproducer mutants were selected. Concentration of clavulanic acid was determined by HPLC analysis. It was concluded that secondary metabolites, mainly antibiotics containing clavulanic <b>acid,</b> were <b>produced</b> about 6 – 7 days after the growth, and concentration of clavulanic acid was increased up to two-folds after UV mutagenesis...|$|R

40|$|The {{prospects}} of peak oil, {{climate change and}} the dependency of fossil carbon have urged {{research and development of}} production methods for the manufacture of fuels and chemicals from renewable resources (biomass). To date, the primary emphasis has been placed on the replacement of oil for transportation fuels. A highly significant subset of petroleum usage is the production of chemicals, which represents 10 - 15 % of the petroleum usage. White biotechnology, also called industrial biotechnology, is a fast evolving technology with a large potential to have a substantial impact on the industrial production of fuels and chemicals from biomass. This work addresses the issue of chemical production by investigating the production of bio-based succinic acid, which {{can be used in a}} wide range of applications to replace petroleum based chemicals. Succinic <b>acid</b> can be <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>fermentation</b> of sugar <b>by</b> a number of organisms; one is Escherichia coli (E. coli). It is known that E. coli under anaerobic conditions produces a mixture of organic acids.

In the current work, E. coli mutant AFP 184 was used. AFP 184 originates from a near wild type strain, the C 600 (ATCC 23724), which can ferment both five and si...|$|R
