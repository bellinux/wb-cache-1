5|$|Despite {{being the}} preseason co-favorite in the league, Texas A {{finished}} 14-18 overall and 4-14 in the Big 12. The team was hampered by <b>a</b> <b>rash</b> <b>of</b> injuries, including {{a knee injury}} that forced Middleton to sit for 12 games. He averaged 13.2 points and 5.0 rebounds per game, down from the previous season. On April 9, 2012, Middleton declared for the NBA Draft, forgoing his final season of collegiate eligibility. He thanked Texas A in a statement.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak {{announced}} in October 1976 that the North Coast Hiawatha {{would be the}} second train, after the Empire Builder, to receive the new bi-level Superliner coaches, then on order from Pullman Standard. In the end the train was cancelled before the Superliners entered long-distance service. In the spring of 1977 Amtrak added seven hours to the schedule, increasing it to 52 hours 30 minutes. The change was prompted by new speed restrictions on Amtrak trains after <b>a</b> <b>rash</b> <b>of</b> derailments involving the new EMD SDP40F diesel locomotives. In September Amtrak eliminated the off-day ChicagoSt. Paul service, leaving the North Coast Hiawatha with three trips a week. Amtrak reduced the Empire Builder to quad-weekly service as well. The Twin Cities Hiawatha returned as a daytime service between Chicago and Minneapolis.|$|E

By the early 1990s there was sufficient interest among his seminar graduates to launch a collaborative implementation of his work, and the Bootstrap Alliance was formed as a non-profit home base for this effort. Although the invasion of Iraq and subsequent recession spawned <b>a</b> <b>rash</b> <b>of</b> belt-tightening reorganizations which drastically redirected the efforts of their alliance partners, they continued with the management seminars, consulting, and small-scale collaborations. In the mid-1990s they were awarded some DARPA funding to develop a modern user interface to Augment, called Visual AugTerm (VAT), while participating in a larger program addressing the IT requirements of the Joint Task Force.|$|E

He is the protagonist of Naruto Jinraiden: The Day the Wolf Howled, which explores Sasuke's reflections after Itachi's death and his decision to destroy Konoha.

5|$|Despite the {{technical}} innovations of the railway {{and the large}} passenger demand, the C was not particularly profitable and the rapid series of extensions aimed at improving profits had placed a strain on the finances. The dividends were low and declining (2​18% in 1898, 1​78% in 1899 and 1​14% in 1900) and the company {{had been accused of}} extravagance for the abandonment of King William Street station. In an attempt to work around this poor reputation and make it easier to raise funds, the next bill for an extension of the line was submitted in November 1900 by a notionally separate company, the Islington and Euston Railway (I), albeit one that shared its chairman with the C The proposed railway was to run from the as yet unfinished C station at Angel to the main-line stations at King's Cross, St Pancras and Euston. The I bill coincided with <b>a</b> <b>rash</b> <b>of</b> other railway bills encouraged by the successful opening of the Central London Railway (CLR) in 1900 and was considered alongside these by another Parliamentary Joint Committee in 1901. The bill was approved, but the time taken for the committee's review meant {{that it had to be}} resubmitted for the 1902 Parliamentary session.|$|E

The use of diachylon became prevalent in the English Midlands up until World War I. Criminal investigation of an abortionist in Calgary, Alberta in 1894 revealed through chemical analysis that the concoction he had supplied to a man seeking an abortifacient contained Spanish fly.|$|E

It eventually reached the point where the Chinese were acting in an insulting manner towards the marches of the naval land forces.|$|E
25|$|The {{modern day}} {{interest}} in absinthe has spawned <b>a</b> <b>rash</b> <b>of</b> absinthe kits from companies that claim they produce homemade absinthe. Kits often call for soaking herbs in vodka or alcohol, or adding a liquid concentrate to vodka or alcohol {{to create an}} ersatz absinthe. Such practices usually yield a harsh substance that bears {{little resemblance to the}} genuine article, and are considered inauthentic by any practical standard. Some concoctions may even be dangerous, especially if they call for supplementation with potentially poisonous herbs, oils and/or extracts.

As a result, Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa's Mobile Fleet departed Tawi-Tawi a day ahead of schedule. The premature departure upset the Japanese battle plans, and forced Ozawa to delay his carrier force in the Philippine Sea, thus contributing to the stunning defeat suffered by the Japanese in the ensuing battle.|$|E
