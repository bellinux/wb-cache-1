2500|$|Research {{studying}} {{the acquisition of}} both spoken <b>and</b> <b>sign</b> language also lends support to this theory. [...] A study examining the acquisition of both spoken <b>and</b> <b>sign</b> language by children of deaf parents indicated that the children acquired both languages {{in the same manner}} as children learning two spoken languages. [...] Moreover, the study indicated that bilingual children, including those learning both spoken <b>and</b> <b>sign</b> language, were able to acquire various linguistic concepts at the same rate as monolinguistic children. [...] While bilingual children tend to include mixed language in their speech, children acquiring both spoken <b>and</b> <b>sign</b> language have shown indications of simultaneous language mixing by both speaking <b>and</b> <b>signing</b> certain words together. [...] Though it is only possible to observe this type of language mixing when the child is learning both spoken <b>and</b> <b>sign</b> language, it provides support for the Dual Language System Hypothesis, indicating that the simultaneous operation of separate two language systems could be a cause of language mixing by bilingual children.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{symptoms}} <b>and</b> <b>signs</b> {{in women}} with single and mixed genital infections. METHODS: The study population comprised 996 apparently healthy women. Gynecological symptoms <b>and</b> <b>signs</b> were looked for and diagnostics for the most prevalent gynecological infections were made. RESULTS: When co-infections were excluded, chlamydial infections, bacterial vaginosis and cervical human papillomavirus infections were associated with a fishy malodor; for the two former conditions an easily bleeding ectopy was also found. Vaginal candidosis showed characteristic symptoms <b>and</b> <b>signs.</b> Genital warts were associated with dysuria, general and lower abdominal pain. Out of 494 women with a genital infection, 112 (22. 7 %) had a mixed infection, which in some cases influenced symptoms <b>and</b> <b>signs.</b> CONCLUSION: Many women who consider themselves gynecologically healthy, may nevertheless harbor one or more infectious agents. The need to exclude multiple infections is obvious. Positive predictive values were for specific symptoms <b>and</b> <b>signs</b> were generally low...|$|R
