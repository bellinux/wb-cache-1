60|$|Mr. Pickwick {{stood in}} the {{principal}} street of this illustrious town, and gazed {{with an air of}} curiosity, not unmixed with interest, on the objects around him. There was an open square for the market-place; and in the centre of it, a large inn with a sign-post in front, displaying an object very common in art, but rarely met with in nature--to wit, a blue lion, with three bow legs in the <b>air,</b> <b>balancing</b> himself on the extreme point of the centre claw of his fourth foot. There were, within sight, an auctioneer's and fire-agency office, a corn-factor's, a linen-draper's, a saddler's, a distiller's, a grocer's, and a shoe-shop--the last-mentioned warehouse being also appropriated to the diffusion of hats, bonnets, wearing apparel, cotton umbrellas, and useful knowledge. There was a red brick house with a small paved courtyard in front, which anybody might have known belonged to the attorney; and there was, moreover, another red brick house with Venetian blinds, and a large brass door-plate with a very legible announcement that it belonged to the surgeon. A few boys were making their way to the cricket-field; and two or three shopkeepers who were standing at their doors looked as if they should like to be making their way to the same spot, as indeed to all appearance they might have done, without losing any great amount of custom thereby. Mr. Pickwick having paused to make these observations, to be noted down at a more convenient period, hastened to rejoin his friends, who had turned out of the main street, and were already within sight of the field of battle.|$|E

40|$|The {{link between}} a good indoor climate and {{environmental}} impacts e. g. {{global warming and}} different pollution in the air is something that are important today and will certainly become {{more important in the}} future with increased energy prices and new laws. Too keep the indoor air quality within limits is it important to have a good and competitive ventilationsystem. The ventilations function is mainly to supply fresh air and to remove polluted air from the room. It’s important that the ventilation system works as it should so that the indoor air quality is as good as possible. The lack of good ventilation can create several symptoms such as headaches, nausea, fatigue, poor concentration etc. In Sweden are ventilation control mandatory for every newly produced building and this control are repetitive usually every 3 - 6 years for some types of buildings.   The foundation of this thesis is from a previous degree project performed by a master’s student in 2013 named Ander Barroeta with supervision of Magnus Mattsson and Taghi Karimipanah. The thesis was to improve and design a ventilation system in two rooms at a training facility named Friskis & Svettis in Gävle so that the CO 2 level did not exceed 1000 ppm.   In this thesis was the main goal to do similar measurements as the previous thesis and compare the results to see what difference <b>air</b> <b>balancing</b> has done to the ventilation system. Field measurements were performed at the training facility were the focus was on carbon dioxide but also on other parameters such as temperature, humidity and air velocity so that air exchange rate could be calculated. With these parameters can evaluations be made to see if <b>air</b> <b>balancing</b> of the ventilation system made any difference in indoor air quality.       During measurements in one of the training rooms where spinning is exercised was carbon dioxide levels up to 3300 ppm measured which is above the recommended indoor limit at 1000 ppm. If that room should be design to not exceed 1000 ppm must the air exchange rate increase from 6. 3 h- 1 to 35. 1 h- 1...|$|E

40|$|The use of air {{cleaning}} systems to reduce ammonia emissions from animal houses is increasing. These systems are normally used {{in order to}} comply with local or national regulations of ammonia emission. Therefore, accurate determination of the proportion of ammonia being removed by these systems is crucial. There are two main methods available to measure ammonia removal efficiency of scrubbers: <b>air</b> <b>balance</b> (based on the measurement of ammonia concentrations in air) and combined water-air balance (in which it is also necessary to {{determine the amount of}} nitrogen recovered in the liquid phase). The first method is simpler to establish, while the second method might provide deeper information about the processes occurring. The main aim of this work was to assess, in terms of the variability of the results, the use of these two methods to evaluate the efficiency of an acid packed bed scrubber on a pig farm. An acid packed bed scrubber (70 % NH 3 removal) was monitored during ten complete 24 h cycles for ammonia concentrations, airflow rates, and nitrogen accumulation in the acid solution basin. The average efficiency calculated using the <b>air</b> <b>balance</b> method was 71 % (Â± 4 %), close to the design value of 70 %, while the average efficiency when using the combined water-air balance method was 255 % (Â± 53 %). The accumulation and precipitation of ammonium salts in the packing material seem to be the main cause of the high variability and inaccuracy of the combined water-air balance method observed for this type of scrubber. According to these results, it is recommended to use the <b>air</b> <b>balance</b> method when determining the ammonia removal efficiency for acid packed bed scrubbers similar to the one studied here. According to the variability of the results observed in this work, at least 24 measurement days are needed {{in order to keep the}} relative error below 5 % when using the <b>air</b> <b>balance</b> method to determine the ammonia removal efficiency of an acid packed bed scrubbe...|$|R

40|$|Human {{vitreous}} is {{a natural}} intraocular polymeric hydrogel with distinct biochemical and physiological functions. Surgical removal of the vitreous, or vitrectomy, is now commonly performed {{for the treatment of}} many vitreoretinal diseases. This has led to the need for developing substances {{that can be used to}} replace vitreous. Although early attempts for vitreous transplantation have yielded little success [1], a range of other vitreous substitutes has been developed. An ideal substitute should have all the good qualities of the human vitreous, including transparency, elasticity, buffer capacity, and biocompatibility with surrounding ocular tissues. However, none of the currently available vitreous substitutes possesses all these qualities. In modern vitreoretinal surgery, both short-acting (e. g., <b>air,</b> <b>balanced</b> salt solutions, expansile gases) and long-acting vitreous substitutes (e. g., silicone oil) are used. All these substitutes have significant shortcomings, mostly related to the lack of local biocompatibility and inadequate physiological role.
