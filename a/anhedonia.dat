5|$|Deficits in {{cognitive}} abilities are {{widely recognized as}} a core feature of schizophrenia. The extent of the cognitive deficits an individual experiences is a predictor of how functional an individual will be, the quality of occupational performance, and how successful the individual will be in maintaining treatment. The presence and degree of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia {{has been reported to}} be a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of positive or negative symptoms. The deficits impacting the cognitive function are found in a large number of areas: working memory, long-term memory, verbal declarative memory, semantic processing, episodic memory, attention, learning (particularly verbal learning). Deficits in verbal memory are the most pronounced in individuals with schizophrenia, and are not accounted for by deficit in attention. Verbal memory impairment has been linked to a decreased ability in individuals with schizophrenia to semantically encode (process information relating to meaning), which is cited as a cause for another known deficit in long-term memory. When given a list of words, healthy individuals remember positive words more frequently (known as the Pollyanna principle); however, individuals with schizophrenia tend to remember all words equally regardless of their connotations, suggesting that the experience of <b>anhedonia</b> impairs the semantic encoding of the words. These deficits have been found in individuals before the onset of the illness to some extent. First-degree family members of individuals with schizophrenia and other high-risk individuals also show a degree of deficit {{in cognitive}} abilities, and specifically in working memory.A review of the literature on cognitive deficits in individuals with schizophrenia shows that the deficits may be present in early adolescence, or as early as childhood. The deficits which an individual with schizophrenia presents tend to remain the same over time in most patients, or follow an identifiable course based upon environmental variables.|$|E
25|$|The {{inability}} to have orgasm, or regular difficulty reaching orgasm after ample sexual stimulation, is called anorgasmia or inorgasmia. If a male experiences erection and ejaculation but no orgasm, {{he is said}} to have sexual <b>anhedonia</b> (a condition in which an individual cannot feel pleasure from an orgasm) or ejaculatory <b>anhedonia.</b> Anorgasmia is significantly more common in women than in men, which has been attributed to the lack of sex education with regard to women's bodies, especially in sex-negative cultures, such as clitoral stimulation usually being key for women to orgasm.|$|E
25|$|Depressive symptoms, if seen in CFS, may be {{differentially}} diagnosed from {{primary depression}} {{by the absence}} of <b>anhedonia,</b> decreased motivation, and guilt; and the presence of somatic symptoms such as sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, and exercise intolerance with post exertional exacerbation of symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{her career}} she {{recognized}} that negative symptoms and associated cognitive impairments had more debilitating effects than psychotic symptoms, like delusions and hallucinations. While psychotic symptoms represent an exaggeration of normal brain/mind functions, negative symptoms represent a loss of normal functions, for example, alogia {{the loss of the}} ability to think and speak fluently, affective blunting the loss of the ability to express emotions, avolition, loss of the ability to initiate goal-directed activity, and <b>anhedonia,</b> loss of the ability to experience emotions. The papers describing these concepts have become citation classics, as determined by the Science Citation Index produced by the Institute for Scientific Information.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, many addicts report {{symptoms}} of <b>anhedonia</b> (i.e., {{the inability to}} experience pleasure). Results of chronic deviation of the brain's reward set point, which follow a prolonged intoxication, diminish responsiveness to natural positive stimuli. This may result in an over-responsiveness to substance-related cues, coupled with an impaired capacity to initiate behaviours in response to natural rewards. Thus, low positive affect inhibits the individual's ability to replace drug-taking with other rewarding activities. It has also been proposed that during substance dependence the somatic states that guide decision-making are weakened in relation to natural rewards, {{while at the same}} time they enhance the emotional response to drug-related stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Zopiclone has the {{potential}} for misuse and dosage escalation, drug abuse, and drug dependence. It is abused orally and sometimes intravenously, and often combined with alcohol to achieve a combined sedative hypnotic—alcohol euphoria. Patients abusing the drug are also at risk of dependence. Withdrawal symptoms can be seen after long-term use of normal doses even after a gradual reduction regimen. The Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties recommends zopiclone prescriptions not exceed 7 to 10 days, owing to concerns of addiction, tolerance, and physical dependence. Two types of drug misuse can occur: either recreational misuse, wherein the drug is taken to achieve a high, or when the drug is continued long-term against medical advice. Zopiclone may be more addictive than benzodiazepines. Those with a history of substance misuse or mental health disorders may be at an increased risk of high-dose zopiclone misuse. High dose misuse of zopiclone and increasing popularity amongst drug abusers who have been prescribed with zopiclone The symptoms of zopiclone addiction can include depression, dysphoria, hopelessness, slow thoughts, social isolation, worrying, sexual <b>anhedonia,</b> and nervousness.|$|E
500|$|Alternatively, self-harm {{may be a}} {{means of}} feeling something, even if the {{sensation}} is unpleasant and painful. Those who self-harm sometimes describe feelings of emptiness or numbness (<b>anhedonia),</b> and physical pain may be a relief from these feelings. [...] "A person may be detached from himself or herself, detached from life, numb and unfeeling. They may then recognise the need to function more, or have a desire to feel real again, and a decision is made to create sensation and 'wake up'." ...|$|E
500|$|Allen {{suggested}} <b>Anhedonia,</b> a {{term for}} the inability to experience pleasure, as a working title, and Brickman suggested alternatives including It Had to Be Jew, Rollercoaster Named Desire and Me and My Goy. An advertising agency, hired by United Artists, embraced Allen's choice of an obscure word by suggesting the studio take out newspaper advertisements that looked like fake tabloid headlines such as [...] "Anhedonia Strikes Cleveland!". However, Allen experimented with several titles over five test screenings, including Anxiety and Annie and Alvy, before settling on Annie Hall.|$|E
500|$|There is {{significant}} {{debate over whether}} or not asexuality is a sexual orientation. It has been compared and equated with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), in that both imply a general lack of sexual attraction to anyone; HSDD has been used to medicalize asexuality, but asexuality is generally not considered a disorder or a sexual dysfunction (such as anorgasmia, <b>anhedonia,</b> etc.), because it does not necessarily define someone as having a medical problem or problems relating to others socially. Unlike people with HSDD, asexual people normally do not experience [...] "marked distress" [...] and [...] "interpersonal difficulty" [...] concerning feelings about their sexuality, or generally a lack of sexual arousal; asexuality is considered the lack or absence of sexual attraction as a life-enduring characteristic. One study found that, compared to HSDD subjects, asexuals reported lower levels of sexual desire, sexual experience, sex-related distress and depressive symptoms. Researchers Richards and Barker report that asexuals do not have disproportionate rates of alexithymia, depression, or personality disorders. Some people, however, may identify as asexual even if their non-sexual state is explained by {{one or more of the}} aforementioned disorders.|$|E
500|$|Coppola's {{first three}} films examine {{feminine}} self-definition and maturation, usually in privileged circumstance. Lost in Translation (2003) depicts an encounter and brief friendship between two lonely Americans in a luxurious Tokyo hotel; Marie Antoinette (2006), a stylized biopic of the eponymous queen, examined her loneliness. Somewhere examines similar themes {{of success and}} isolation, but from a male perspective. The film explores Marco's seclusion and depression despite his outward professional success and the resulting wealth and fame. He appears to suffer from <b>anhedonia,</b> the inability to feel pleasure, but the film itself is reticent in suggesting its causes. [...] "He believes he's nothing", summarized film critic Roger Ebert, [...] "and it appears he's correct". The film's opening shot, a Ferrari circling a race-track {{in and out of}} a stationary camera position, its whine and roar rising and falling, establishes the theme of ennui. The sequence's length also offers a visual cue from Coppola to relax, observe and withhold expectations. Coppola said she wanted to hint at this with a simple camera set-up, [...] "so you're alone with this guy and not aware that it's a movie. But I hope it's a welcome contrast to the style of most movies out there. Something that gives you a chance to take a breath".|$|E
500|$|While {{dopamine}} has {{a central}} role in mediating [...] "wanting" [...] — associated with the appetitive or approach behavioral responses to rewarding stimuli, detailed studies have shown that dopamine cannot simply be equated with hedonic [...] "liking" [...] or pleasure, as reflected in the consummatory behavioral response. Dopamine neurotransmission is involved in some but not all aspects of pleasure-related cognition, since pleasure centers have been identified both within the dopamine system (i.e., nucleus accumbens shell) and outside the dopamine system (i.e., ventral pallidum and parabrachial nucleus). [...] For example, direct electrical stimulation of dopamine pathways, using electrodes implanted in the brain, is experienced as pleasurable, and many types of animals are willing to work to obtain it. Antipsychotic drugs used to treat psychosis reduce dopamine levels and tend to cause <b>anhedonia,</b> a diminished ability to experience pleasure. Many types of pleasurable experiences—such as sex, enjoying food, or playing video games—increase dopamine release. All addictive drugs directly or indirectly affect dopamine neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens; these drugs increase drug [...] "wanting", leading to compulsive drug use, when repeatedly taken in high doses, presumably through the sensitization of incentive-salience. Drugs that increase synaptic dopamine concentrations include psychostimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine. These produce increases in [...] "wanting" [...] behaviors, but do not greatly alter expressions of pleasure or change levels of satiation. However, opiate drugs such as heroin or morphine produce increases in expressions of [...] "liking" [...] and [...] "wanting" [...] behaviors. Moreover, animals in which the ventral tegmental dopamine system has been rendered inactive do not seek food, and will starve to death if left to themselves, but if food is placed in their mouths they will consume it and show expressions indicative of pleasure.|$|E

2500|$|No {{medications}} {{are indicated}} for directly treating schizoid personality disorder, but certain medications {{may reduce the}} symptoms of SPD as well as treat co-occurring mental disorders. The symptoms of SPD mirror the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as <b>anhedonia,</b> blunted affect and low energy, and SPD {{is thought to be}} part of the [...] "schizophrenic spectrum" [...] of disorders, which also includes the schizotypal and paranoid personality disorders, and may benefit from the medications indicated for schizophrenia. Originally, low doses of atypical antipsychotics like risperidone or olanzapine were used to alleviate social deficits and blunted affect. However, a recent review concluded that atypical antipsychotics were ineffective for treating personality disorders. In contrast, the substituted amphetamine Bupropion may be used to treat <b>anhedonia.</b> Likewise, Modafinil may be effective in treating some of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, which are reflected in the symptomatology of SPD and therefore may help as well. Lamotrigine, SSRIs, TCAs, MAOIs and Hydroxyzine may help counter social anxiety in people with SPD if present, though social anxiety may not be a main concern for the people who have SPD. However, it is not general practice to treat SPD with medications, other than for the short term treatment of acute co-occurring Axis I conditions (e.g. depression).|$|E
2500|$|Sexual {{dysfunction}} {{is often}} {{a side effect of}} drugs that inhibit serotonin reuptake. Specifically, common side effects include difficulty becoming aroused, lack of interest in sex, and anorgasmia (trouble achieving orgasm). Loss of or decreased response to sexual stimuli and ejaculatory <b>anhedonia</b> are also possible. Frequency of treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction in long-term treatment {{has been found to be}} similar for duloxetine and SSRIs when compared in clinical trials, [...] while there is some evidence that duloxetine is associated with less sexual dysfunction than escitalopram when measured at 4 and 8 weeks of treatment.|$|E
2500|$|A formal {{survey of}} {{dextromethorphan}} users showed {{that more than}} half of users reported experience of the following withdrawal-symptoms individually for the first week after long-term/addictive dextromethorphan use: fatigue, apathy, flashbacks, and constipation. Over a quarter reported insomnia, nightmares, <b>anhedonia,</b> impaired memory, attention deficit and decreased libido. Rarer side effects included panic attacks, impaired learning, tremor, jaundice, urticaria (hives) and myalgia. DXM has also been [...] "known to increase the frequency of complex partial seizures in epileptics by 25% compared to placebo." [...] Frequent and long-term usage at high doses could possibly lead to toxic psychosis and other permanent psychological problems. It is important to note that medical DXM use has not been shown to cause the above issues.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anhedonia</b> {{is present}} in several forms of psychopathology. However, social <b>anhedonia</b> is not a {{necessary}} symptom criterion of any disorder. Social <b>anhedonia</b> manifests similarly {{in a variety of}} different mental illness, but for differing reasons.

50|$|Social <b>anhedonia</b> is {{observed}} in both depression and schizophrenia. However, social <b>anhedonia</b> {{is a state}} related to the depressive episode {{and the other is}} trait related to the personality construct associated with schizophrenia. These individuals both tend to score highly on self-report measures of social <b>anhedonia.</b> Blanchard, Horan, and Brown (2001) demonstrated that, although both the depression and the schizophrenia patient groups can look very similar in terms of social <b>anhedonia</b> cross sectionally, over time as individuals with depression experience symptom remission, they show fewer signs of social <b>anhedonia,</b> while individuals with schizophrenia do not. Blanchard and colleagues (2011) found individuals with social <b>anhedonia</b> also had elevated rates of lifetime mood disorders including depression and dysthymia compared to controls.|$|E
5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, social {{anxiety and}} social <b>anhedonia</b> differ in important ways. However, social <b>anhedonia</b> and social anxiety are also often comorbid with each other. People with social <b>anhedonia</b> may display increased social anxiety and be {{at increased risk}} for social phobias and generalized anxiety disorder. It has yet to be determined what the exact relationship between social <b>anhedonia</b> and social anxiety is, and if one potentiates the other. Individuals with social <b>anhedonia</b> may display increased stress reactivity, meaning that they feel more overwhelmed or helpless in response to a stressful event compared to control subjects who experience the same type of stressor. This dysfunctional stress reactivity may correlate with hedonic capacity, providing a potential explanation for the increased anxiety symptoms experienced in people with social <b>anhedonia.</b> In an attempt to separate out social <b>anhedonia</b> from social anxiety, the Revised Social <b>Anhedonia</b> Scale [...] didn't include items that potentially targeted social anxiety. However, more research must be conducted on the underlying mechanisms through which social <b>anhedonia</b> overlaps and interacts with social anxiety. The efforts of the “social processes” RDoC initiative will be crucial in differentiating between these components of social behavior that may underlie mental illnesses such as schizophrenia.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that social <b>anhedonia</b> may represent a prodrome of psychotic disorders. First-degree relatives of individuals with schizophrenia show elevated levels of social <b>anhedonia,</b> higher baseline scores of social <b>anhedonia</b> are associated with later development of schizophrenia. These findings provide support for the conjecture that it represents a genetic risk marker for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.|$|E
50|$|L.J. and J.P. Chapman {{were the}} first to discuss the {{possibility}} that social <b>anhedonia</b> may stem from a genetic vulnerability. The Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) gene has been consistently associated with risk for, and cause of, schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and other mental illnesses. More recently, DISC1 has been associated with social <b>anhedonia</b> within the general population. Tomppo (2009) identified a specific DISC1 allele that is associated with an increase in characteristics of social <b>anhedonia.</b> They also identified a DISC1 allele associated with decreased characteristics of social <b>anhedonia,</b> that was found to be preferentially expressed in women. More research needs to be conducted, but social <b>anhedonia</b> may be an important intermediate phenotype (endophenotype) between genes associated with risk for schizophrenia and phenotype of the disorder. Continued study of social <b>anhedonia</b> and its genetic components will help researchers and clinicians learn more about the cause of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anhedonia</b> is the {{inability}} to experience pleasure from activities usually found enjoyable, e.g. exercise, hobbies, singing, sexual activities or social interactions. While earlier definitions of <b>anhedonia</b> emphasized pleasurable experience, more recent models have highlighted the need to consider different aspects of enjoyable behavior, such as motivation or desire to engage in activities (motivational <b>anhedonia),</b> {{as compared to the}} level of enjoyment of the activity itself ("consummatory anhedonia").|$|E
5000|$|There is no {{validated}} {{treatment for}} social <b>anhedonia.</b> Future research {{should focus on}} genetic and environmental risk factors to home in on specific brain regions and neurotransmitters that may be implicated in social anhedonia's cause and could be targeted with medication or behavioral treatments. Social support may also play a valuable role {{in the treatment of}} social <b>anhedonia.</b> Blanchard et al. (2011) [...] found that a greater number of social supports as well as a greater perceived social support network were related to fewer schizophrenia-spectrum symptoms and to better general functioning within the social <b>anhedonia</b> group. So far, no medicine has been developed to specifically target <b>anhedonia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Social <b>anhedonia</b> {{may be a}} valid {{predictor}} of future schizophrenia-spectrum disorders; young adults with social <b>anhedonia</b> perform in a similar direction to schizophrenia patients in tests of cognition and social behavior, showing potential predictive validity. Social <b>anhedonia</b> usually manifests in adolescence, possibly because {{of a combination of}} the occurrence of critical neuronal development and synaptic pruning of brain regions important for social behavior and environmental changes, when adolescents {{are in the process of}} becoming individuals and gaining more independence.|$|E
5000|$|Social <b>anhedonia</b> is a core {{characteristic}} of schizotypy, which {{is defined as}} a continuum of personality traits that can range from normal to disordered and contributes to risk for psychosis and schizophrenia. Social <b>anhedonia</b> is a dimension of both negative and positive schizotypy. It involves social and interpersonal deficits, but is also associated with cognitive slippage and disorganized speech, both of which fall into the category of positive schizotypy. Not all people with schizophrenia display social <b>anhedonia</b> [...] and likewise, people who have social <b>anhedonia</b> may never be diagnosed with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder if {{they do not have the}} positive and cognitive symptoms that are most frequently associated with most schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.|$|E
50|$|Musical <b>anhedonia,</b> {{also known}} {{formally}} as specific musical <b>anhedonia,</b> signifies an individual's incapacity to enjoy listening to music.

50|$|Social <b>anhedonia</b> {{is defined}} as a trait-like disinterest in social contact and is {{characterized}} by social withdrawal and decreased pleasure in social situations. This characteristic typically manifests as an indifference to other people. In contrast to introversion, a nonpathological dimension of human personality, social <b>anhedonia</b> represents a deficit in the ability to experience pleasure. Additionally, social <b>anhedonia</b> differs from social anxiety in that social <b>anhedonia</b> is predominantly typified by diminished positive affect, while social anxiety is distinguished by both decreased positive affect and exaggerated negative affect. This trait is currently seen as a central characteristic to, as well as a predictor of, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, as it is seen as a potential evolution of most personality disorders, if the patient is above age 24, when prodromal schizophrenia may be excluded.|$|E
