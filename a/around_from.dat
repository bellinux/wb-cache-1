At seeing this huge vessel, pandemonium broke out amongst the townspeople; they visited the floating castle and sought out drunken sailors in taverns and pubs, buying, stealing, pinching and fighting for the takings. Local fishermen as well ventured aboard, further depleting the cargo.|$|E
5|$|During {{the clay}} season, Federer's {{victory in the}} Hamburg Masters final was {{particularly}} impressive, as it snapped Rafael Nadal's 81-match winning streak on clay, an Open-Era record. Federer turned the match <b>around</b> <b>from</b> a set down to sweep 12 of the final 14 games, including a final set bagel. At the French Open, some anticipated that Federer could become the first man in almost 40 years to hold all four majors simultaneously, having just resoundingly defeated young rival Nadal on clay entering the tournament. However, in {{a repeat of the}} previous year Federer played a tough four-set final against Nadal, but was undone by going 1/17 on break-point chances.|$|E
5|$|Iwata's {{proficiency}} with programming quickly {{placed him}} in high esteem among fellow programmers and gamers alike. He would often {{continue to work on}} weekends and holidays because of his passion. With the company on the verge of bankruptcy, Iwata was promoted to president of HAL in 1993 at the insistence of Nintendo's then-President, Hiroshi Yamauchi. With assistance from Nintendo, Iwata helped turn the company <b>around</b> <b>from</b> its ¥1.5billion debt and stabilize its finances within six years. Lacking experience in management, Iwata put a lot of effort into learning how to better himself, often reading books on the topic and seeking advice from others.|$|E

5|$|Manning's first start, a Tennessee {{homecoming}} {{game against}} Washington State, {{resulted in a}} 109 win. Things got progressively better for the Volunteers after Manning assumed the starting role, as they won six of their final regular-season games. The sole loss was a 1317 defeat {{at the hands of}} then-No. 10 Alabama in Knoxville. The loss was merely a bump in the road, however, as Tennessee won all four regular-season games that followed, ending the regular season with a 650 drubbing of in-state rival Vanderbilt. In response to Fulmer's success at turning the team <b>around</b> <b>from</b> a slow start, he was awarded with a one-year contract extension by the university.|$|E
5|$|The team {{entered the}} season {{surrounded}} by questions {{of how they}} would overcome the late season collapse from last year and {{what it would take}} for Rich Rodriguez to return for a fourth year. On January 5, Michigan hired Dave Brandon to replace Bill Martin as its athletic director. Martin had previously announced his retirement during the 2009 season. Reaction to the hire was positive, but the hire also brought increased scrutiny upon Rich Rodriguez, as Brandon {{made it clear that he}} would do whatever was necessary to turn the program <b>around</b> <b>from</b> its recent slump.|$|E

5|$|Though set in {{the modern}} day, the film uses various {{unconventional}} techniques to make the films look like those that were shown in grindhouse theaters in the 1970s. Throughout both feature-length segments and the fake trailers, the film is intentionally damaged {{to make it look}} like many of the exploitation films of the 1970s, which were generally shipped <b>around</b> <b>from</b> theater to theater and usually ended up in bad shape. To reproduce the look of damaged film reels in Planet Terror, five of the six 25,000-frame reels were edited with real film damage, plug-ins, and stock footage.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method is}} to use the {{aberration}} of light, discovered and explained by James Bradley in the 18th century. This effect results from the vector addition of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source (such as a star) and the velocity of its observer (see diagram on the right). A moving observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position. Since the direction of the Earth's velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun, this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move <b>around.</b> <b>From</b> the angular difference in the position of stars (maximally 20.5 arcseconds) it is possible to express the speed of light in terms of the Earth's velocity around the Sun, which with the known length of a year can be converted to the time needed to travel from the Sun to the Earth. In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8minutes 12seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.|$|E

25|$|After Schwartzwalder {{departed}} for Syracuse in 1949, the Mules {{fell off the}} national radar until the hiring of Mike Donnelly in 1997. Despite a rough 1-9 inaugural campaign, Donnelly quickly got the team turned <b>around.</b> <b>From</b> 2000–2004, the Mules won five straight Centennial Conference championships, and thus, earned five straight postseason berths. In 2007, the Mules again won the Centennial Conference, and received another berth in the NCAA playoffs, winning their first-round game before falling in the second round. Donnelly took his team back to the playoffs by winning the Centennial Conference again in 2008, where they fell in the first round, and again in 2010, with the same result.|$|E

25|$|Pardew's first {{experience}} as manager came in March 1998 {{when he was}} appointed as caretaker after the departure of Bullivant. His first match in charge was against Huddersfield Town on 21 March 1998, which Reading lost 0–2. After the appointment of Tommy Burns he remained as reserve team manager {{until the end of}} the 1998–99 season, when Reading disbanded their reserve team. Nevertheless, he was promoted to manager of the club after a successful spell as caretaker in 1999. He turned the club <b>around</b> <b>from</b> relegation fighters to promotion candidates through players, such as Jamie Cureton, and his régime to increase the fitness of the squad.|$|E
25|$|Proto-Norse (also called Proto-Scandinavian, Primitive Norse, Proto-Nordic, Ancient Nordic, Ancient Scandinavian, Old Nordic, Old Scandinavian, Proto-North Germanic, North Proto-Germanic or Common Scandinavian) was an Indo-European {{language}} spoken in Scandinavia that {{is thought to}} have evolved as a northern dialect of Proto-Germanic in the first centuries CE. It is the earliest stage of a characteristically North Germanic language, and the language attested in the oldest Scandinavian Elder Futhark inscriptions, spoken <b>around</b> <b>from</b> the 2nd to 8th centuries (corresponding to the late Roman Iron Age and the Germanic Iron Age). It evolved into the dialects of Old Norse {{at the beginning of the}} Viking Age in about 800, which later themselves evolved into modern North Germanic languages.|$|E
25|$|Following the 1972–73 {{season the}} program moved from an {{independent}} NCAA Division I team to NCAA Division II.

Ric Schafer took over as head coach in 1980 and turned the program <b>around</b> <b>from</b> the turmoil of years past. Despite going 1–23–0 and 4–19–0 in his first two seasons, the Nanooks improved with a 17-win season in 1982–83 and back-to-back 20+ win seasons in 1983–84 and 1984–85. The 1984–85 season was Alaska's last season at the NCAA Division II level.|$|E
