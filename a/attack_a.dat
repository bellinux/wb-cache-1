5|$|Again {{waiting until}} late afternoon, the Allies took the {{opportunity}} to <b>attack</b> <b>a</b> patrol of Cilician ships, destroying them, before retreating as night fell. These ships were possibly survivors of the wrecked detachment sent around Euboea, or were perhaps anchored in an isolated harbour.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the station}} was subject of a {{terrorist}} <b>attack.</b> <b>A</b> non-Norwegian man had called the Norwegian police 7.49 in the morning, claiming that he had planted a bomb on the station which would detonate 8.00, eleven minutes later. All traffic on the Østfold Line was stopped, and the station investigated, but no bombs were found.|$|E

5|$|On 28 June 1952, the {{squadron}} {{was ordered to}} <b>attack</b> <b>a</b> convoy of Chinese vehicles. Overton, leading a group of 24 F-84s, directed attacks on the convoy despite taking intense anti-aircraft fire himself, and the aircraft destroyed 150 vehicles. Though the circumstances in the event were lost in subsequent actions, Overton would later be decorated for this achievement.|$|E
5|$|After Cuba was taken, President William McKinley {{approved}} the land invasion of Puerto Rico {{by way of}} Fajardo, taking into consideration that the Spaniards had fortified San Juan, where they expected the initial <b>attack.</b> <b>A</b> convoy of ships left Tampa, Florida and on July 21 another convoy, which included the USS Yale, USS Massachusetts, USS Gloucester and the USS Dixie, departed from Guantánamo for a 4-day journey to Puerto Rico.|$|E

5|$|After {{the first}} tower collapsed, FDNY commanders issued {{evacuation}} warnings. Due to technical difficulties with malfunctioning radio repeater systems, many firefighters {{never heard the}} evacuation orders. 9-1-1 dispatchers also received information from callers that was not passed along to commanders on the scene. Within hours of the <b>attack,</b> <b>a</b> substantial {{search and rescue operation}} was launched. After months of around-the-clock operations, the World Trade Center site was cleared by the end of May 2002.|$|E
5|$|Although {{aircraft}} {{flying over}} the Jisr ed Damieh to Beisan road, the Jisr ed Damieh bridge, Es Salt and Beisan as far as Tubas, reported all quiet at dawn {{on the morning of}} 20 September, RAF Bristol Fighters would later <b>attack</b> <b>a</b> convoy of 200 vehicles withdrawing from Nablus, blocking the road, causing many horses to bolt over a precipice {{on one side of the}} road while men scattered into the hills on the other side. The last reconnaissance on 20 September reported the whole Ottoman line alarmed, three large fires were burning at Nablus railway station and at the Balata supply dumps, while a brigade of British cavalry was seen entering Beisan.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this <b>attack,</b> <b>a</b> 4-inch Mark III QF gun was erected on a {{promontory}} overlooking Village Bay, but it never saw action against the enemy. Of greater long-term significance to the islanders were the introduction of regular {{contact with the outside world}} and the slow development of a money-based economy. This made life easier for the St Kildans but also made them less self-reliant. Both were factors in the evacuation of the island little more than a decade later.|$|E
50|$|September 18: <b>A</b> {{suicide bomber}} <b>attacked</b> <b>a</b> police {{recruitment}} centre in Ramadi killing 13 people and wounding 10. <b>A</b> suicide bomber <b>attacked</b> <b>a</b> Tal Afar market {{killing at least}} 21 people and wounding 17.|$|R

5|$|As part of {{the third}} stage of General Sir Herbert Plumer's Passchendaele offensive, an attack against Broodseinde was {{scheduled}} for 4 October 1917. The 3rd Australian Division's 10th Australian Infantry Brigade {{was one of the}} assault formations charged with delivering the main blow, and ultimately with seizing the heavily defended Broodseinde Ridge. To provide defence against low-flying German aircraft during the <b>attack,</b> <b>a</b> group of 24 men, including Peeler, from the 3rd Pioneer Battalion's machine gun section were attached to the 10th Brigade's 37th Battalion.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} rose {{between the}} colonists and Britain {{in the early}} 1770s, Philipse remained loyal to the crown. He was arrested in August 1776 and held in Connecticut until a parole grant {{at the end of}} the year allowed him to return home as long as he did nothing to support the British war effort. He broke that promise the next spring: he attempted, perhaps at the behest of his wife, to inform the British that a passing column of Continental Army troops was headed south to <b>attack</b> <b>a</b> British camp at Morrisania, now in the Bronx. Shortly afterwards he fled to British-occupied New York; he would never return to his home along the Saw Mill.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of a {{pneumothorax}} {{by physical}} examination alone {{can be difficult}} (particularly in smaller pneumothoraces). A chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or ultrasound is usually used to confirm its presence. Other conditions that can result in similar symptoms include a hemothorax (buildup {{of blood in the}} pleural space), pulmonary embolism, and heart <b>attack.</b> <b>A</b> large bullae may look similar on a chest X-ray.|$|E

5|$|During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Kursura {{operated}} in the Arabian Sea. She {{was given the}} patrol duties at two designated areas before the war started, but was ordered to operate under two restrictions: she was not to cross demarcated shipping corridors and she could <b>attack</b> <b>a</b> target only after positive identification. The aims of her patrol were to sink any Pakistani naval warships, to sink merchant shipping when specifically ordered, and to conduct general patrol and surveillance.|$|E
5|$|Each {{soldier in}} the first two waves had been issued a total of 200 rounds of {{ammunition}} for his rifle, along with rations for one day, and miscellaneous equipment including a gas mask. The third wave had received the same amount of ammunition, but was also issued entrenching equipment that would be used to construct positions to defend the initial gains against the inevitable Ottoman counterattack. In support, each battalion had four Vickers medium machine-guns, which had been issued with 3,500 rounds, and contributed a platoon whose job would be to throw the 1,200 grenades that the brigade had been allocated for the <b>attack.</b> <b>A</b> small section of engineers was also allocated to undertake demolitions.|$|E
5|$|First {{appearing}} in Dead 'Ard and Warrior, The Black Currant returned {{in a series}} of White Dwarf Thrud strips titled Thrud the Destroyer. In this story, The Black Currant is the leader of a horde of warriors who <b>attack</b> <b>a</b> small village, looting the homes, burning the women, raping the livestock and eating the babies. The Black Currant returned again in issue 3 of Critchlow's self-published Thrud the Barbarian comic as the leader of a group of bandits laying siege to a small town. The Black Currant is depicted in heavy black armour, wearing a helmet provided with a pair of exceedingly long, horizontally extending horns.|$|E
50|$|Besides <b>attacking</b> pieces, <b>a</b> {{target of}} a fork can be a direct mating threat (for example, <b>attacking</b> <b>an</b> {{unprotected}} knight while simultaneously setting up a battery of queen and bishop to threaten mate). Or a target can be an implied threat (for example, <b>a</b> knight may <b>attack</b> <b>an</b> unprotected piece while simultaneously threaten to fork queen and rook).|$|R
50|$|Another patrol on May 30 in poor {{conditions}} <b>attacked</b> <b>an</b> Heinkel He 111 {{that was}} preparing to <b>attack</b> <b>an</b> transport. The enemy machine jettisoned its bombs due to the Skuas attack but was then lost in the poor visibility.|$|R

5|$|Following the victory, Maryland {{patrolled the}} {{southern}} approaches to Surigao Strait until 29 October; she then steamed for the Admiralty Isles for brief replenishment and resumed patrol duty around Leyte on 16 November, protecting the landing forces from continued Japanese air attacks. On 29 November, during another Japanese air <b>attack,</b> <b>a</b> kamikaze aircraft surprised and struck Maryland. The aircraft crashed into Maryland between Turrets No. 1 and 2, piercing the forecastle, main, and armored decks and blowing {{a hole in}} the 4-inch steel, causing extensive damage and starting fires. In all, 31 men were killed and 30 wounded in the attack, and the medical department was destroyed but still functional.|$|E
5|$|Graves {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} on July 19, 1965 while skiing in Del Norte, Colorado, twenty years after the Slotin accident, at the age of 55. He had {{suffered}} from hypertension even before the 1946 accident, and had a minor heart attack in December 1955. His father had also {{died of a heart}} <b>attack.</b> <b>A</b> 1978 follow-up study of the Slotin accident victims suggested that latent systemic damage from the accident contributed to heart failure. He was interred in the Guaje Pines Cemetery in Los Alamos, New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 Bond and Alec Trevelyan—agent 006—infiltrate an illicit Soviet {{chemical}} weapons facility and plant explosive charges. Trevelyan is shot, but Bond escapes {{from the facility}} as it explodes. Nine years later, Bond witnesses the theft by criminal organisation Janus of a prototype Eurocopter Tiger helicopter that can withstand an electromagnetic pulse. Janus uses the helicopter to steal the control disk for the dual GoldenEye satellite weapons, using the GoldenEye to destroy the complex with an electromagnetic pulse; there are two survivors of the <b>attack,</b> <b>a</b> programmer, Natalya Simonova, and Boris Grishenko.|$|E
