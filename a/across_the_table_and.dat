25|$|In hell {{the people}} are unable to lift food to their mouths using such {{unwieldy}} cutlery, and are starving. In heaven, the diners feed one another <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> are sated. The story can encourage people to be kind to each other. There are various interpretations of the fable including its use in sermons and in advice to lonely people.|$|E
25|$|A {{shooting}} war {{was triggered}} {{when one of}} the strikers, believed to have been unarmed, had been shot through the throat by a deputized mine guard. In spite of intense pressure from others, Lieutenant Governor David C. Coates helped to persuade Governor Orman not to send the Colorado National Guard. Coates volunteered to mediate, and he was dispatched by the governor {{to be part of a}} commission sent to Telluride to investigate the issues that caused the walkout. Vincent St. John and mine operator Arthur L. Collins finally met <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> the commission was able to effect a settlement between the miners and the company, resulting in more than a year of labor peace in San Miguel County's silver mines.|$|E
60|$|Unluckily Mr. Candy, hearing nothing, {{and miles}} away from suspecting the truth, went on <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> louder <b>and</b> politer than ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be a fool, Leopold," [...] she cried, {{feeling that}} indeed, between {{her father and}} this madman, her life had ceased to be safe. She looked round her {{helpless}}ly. Three or four besotted fools lying helpless <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables,</b> <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> village dancing and making merry some two hundred mètres away, her father--implacable, as she well knew, where her conduct was concerned--and this madman ready to kill to satisfy his lust of vengeance and of hate--she felt that indeed, unless Heaven performed a miracle, here {{was the beginning of}} an awful, an irredeemable tragedy.|$|R
50|$|Grouped round <b>the</b> <b>table</b> at <b>the</b> {{bottom left}} of the {{painting}} are Richard and his seven sons, <b>and</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> Alice <b>and</b> her five daughters. James, the bishop is depicted in his rochet, red gurnard and gown.|$|R
2500|$|In another {{significant}} moment in his officiating career, Strom was saved from an angry mob by legendary center Wilt Chamberlain {{during a game}} played in Memphis, Tennessee in the mid-1960s. Strom had made a call that went against the St. Louis Hawks and at halftime was called a [...] "gutless bastard" [...] by Hawks general manager Irv Gack at the scorer's table. The fiery official asked Gack to repeat the comment as he reached <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> grabbed Gack by the shirt. Fans started {{coming down from the}} seats while Chamberlain, playing for the Philadelphia 76ers at the time, saw what was going on. He stepped across the table, picked Strom up and said, [...] "C'mon Earl. Let's {{get the hell out of}} here." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Washburn, he and Cimino {{spent three}} days {{together}} in Los Angeles at the Sunset Marquis, hammering out the plot. The script eventually went through several drafts, evolving into a story with three distinct acts. Washburn did not interview any veterans to write The Deer Hunter nor do any research. [...] "I had a month, that was it," [...] he explains. [...] "The clock was ticking. Write the fucking script! But all I {{had to do was}} watch TV. Those combat cameramen in Vietnam were out there in the field with the guys. I mean, they had stuff that you wouldn't dream of seeing about Iraq." [...] When Washburn was finished, he says, Cimino and Joann Carelli, an associate producer on The Deer Hunter who went on to produce two more of Cimino's later films, took him to dinner at a cheap restaurant off the Sunset Strip. He recalls, [...] "We finished, and Joann looks at me <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> she says, 'Well, Deric, it's fuck-off time.' I was fired. It was a classic case: you get a dummy, get him to write the goddamn thing, tell him to go fuck himself, put your name on the thing, and he'll go away. I was so tired, I didn't care. I'd been working 20 hours a day for a month. I got on the plane the next day, and I went back to Manhattan and my carpenter job." ...|$|E
60|$|John reached <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> {{seized the}} secretary's hand.|$|E
60|$|Gilbert Deyes leaned <b>across</b> to <b>the</b> side <b>table</b> <b>and</b> helped {{himself to}} a cigarette.|$|R
6000|$|... [Mrs Warren, silenced for a moment, looks forlornly at Vivie, who waits, {{secretly}} {{hoping that}} the combat is over. But the cunning expression comes back into Mrs Warren's face; <b>and</b> she bends <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> sly <b>and</b> urgent, half whispering.] ...|$|R
60|$|Arnold {{glanced up}} quickly but her {{expression}} was entirely innocent. He looked <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> however, <b>and</b> found that Sabatini {{was watching him}} pensively. Fenella leaned towards him. She spoke almost in a whisper, but her tone was cold, almost unfriendly.|$|R
60|$|Helen leaned <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> {{laid her}} hand upon her friend's.|$|E
60|$|Anne leaned <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> took Marilla's {{face in her}} hands.|$|E
60|$|She leaned <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> {{struck him}} heavily upon the cheek.|$|E
60|$|He pushed <b>the</b> {{open book}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> to me, <b>and</b> {{pointed to a}} passage, marked by pencil lines.|$|R
60|$|The supper {{was not a}} merry one. The only cheerful {{conversation}} was <b>the</b> conversation <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> between Naomi <b>and</b> me.|$|R
6000|$|Major Bagstock, {{encouraged}} {{perhaps by}} the softened and confidential tone into which Mrs Skewton, after several times lapsing into {{it for a}} moment, seemed now to have subsided for good, stretched out his hand <b>across</b> <b>the</b> little <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> said with a leer, ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Lecount leaned <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> offered Noel Vanstone her hand.|$|E
60|$|Hogan {{stretched}} a hand <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> set it upon Crispin's arm.|$|E
60|$|The Herr Pfarrer {{stretched}} his hand <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> laid it upon Ulrich's arm.|$|E
60|$|Phipps scowled <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> heavy-eyed <b>and</b> sullen. There {{were black}} lines under his eyes, {{in which the}} gleam of hunger still lurked. His hands were {{gripping}} {{a chunk of the}} bread which he had torn away from the loaf, but which he had seemed to eat with difficulty.|$|R
60|$|Syme also strolled <b>across</b> to <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> found lying <b>across</b> it a walking-stick, {{which turned}} out on {{examination}} to be a sword-stick, a large Colt's revolver, a sandwich case, and a formidable flask of brandy. Over the chair, beside <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> was thrown a heavy-looking cape or cloak.|$|R
6000|$|MORELL (with tender gaiety, leaning <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> towards her, <b>and</b> consoling her). Oh, come, come, come! Never mind, Pross: he IS a silly old fathead, isn't he? ...|$|R
60|$|He {{pushed the}} papers <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> Andrew {{carefully}} studied them before he looked up.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Rice was interested. He {{passed his}} {{cigarette}} case <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> called for Kummel.|$|E
60|$|He stopped. Midwinter {{was leaning}} eagerly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> Midwinter's hand was laid {{suddenly}} on his arm.|$|E
60|$|She mothered {{him with}} her voice, with an ineffable {{tenderness}} in it that I yearned to appropriate. I glanced at him. He sat <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> slender <b>and</b> pale, his head swathed in bandages. He did not move, but his eyes, bright in the lamplight, were fixed upon me in a steady and wondering stare.|$|R
60|$|Every one was {{listening}} to a story which old General Turnbull was telling. Even Sylvia had leaned <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> David turned <b>and</b> looked steadily into his companion's face.|$|R
6000|$|But neither spoke {{a word to}} the other, {{though they}} looked <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> by stealth; <b>and</b> each said in his heart, ‘He has broad shoulders; but I trust mine are as broad as his.’ ...|$|R
60|$|A basilisk glare shot <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> {{turned the}} long boy to stone--all except his mouth, which opened feebly.|$|E
60|$|She drew {{a little}} breath, {{and with a}} quick, impetuous {{movement}} her hand stole <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> pressed mine.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I will,' {{returned}} the other, leaning forward <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> {{speaking in a}} low impressive voice. 'What a liar you are!' ...|$|E
25|$|Vampire Willow {{goes to the}} Bronze, {{where she}} fights with Percy, {{throwing}} him <b>across</b> <b>the</b> pool <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> shows her vampire face to Xander and Buffy. Two vampires sent by the mayor attack her, but she turns them to her side. Buffy and Xander tell Giles that Willow has been killed and turned vampiric, but the genuine Willow arrives to demonstrate their error.|$|R
60|$|Almost {{immediately}} the slate seemed seized {{by a powerful}} hand. It began to slide back <b>and</b> forth <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> violently, twisting <b>and</b> clattering. The youth put forth his own great strength and stopped it, but a crunching sound announced that the slate was broken.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> at him, <b>and</b> Nigel {{suddenly}} felt a great weight of depression lifted from his heart. He {{forgot all about}} his country's peril. Life and its possibilities seemed somehow all different. He was carried away by a rare wave of emotion.|$|R
