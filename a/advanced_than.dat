5|$|Gemini was a {{step forward}} for NASA's manned space program: the Gemini capsule was larger and more <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> Mercury, capable of {{supporting}} two men {{for up to a}} two-week mission. Because of the longer mission durations, Mission Control began to be manned in shifts. In 1964, Glynn Lunney and Gene Kranz were selected by Chris Kraft to join Kraft and his deputy John Hodge as flight directors. Aged only twenty-eight, Lunney was the youngest of the four.|$|E
5|$|In his 1892 work La planète Mars et ses {{conditions}} d'habitabilité, Camille Flammarion {{wrote about}} how these channels resembled man-made canals, which an intelligent race could use to redistribute water across a dying Martian world. He advocated {{for the existence of}} such inhabitants, and suggested they may be more <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> humans.|$|E
5|$|Lacking Havok, Euphoria, and DMM, Krome's Wii version {{relies on}} the company's {{in-house}} physics engine. Some character animations may be ragdoll while others are preset; in developing the game, Krome tried to blur {{the distinction between the}} two. The lighting system in the Wii version is more <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> that in the PS2 version, which Krome also built; the PS2 includes more graphic details than their PSP version.|$|E

5|$|Land warfare {{changed from}} the static front lines of World WarI to {{increased}} mobility and combined arms. The tank, which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon. In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> it had been during World War I, and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed, armour and firepower.|$|E
5|$|The Inuit of the Thule culture—whose {{descendants}} {{form the}} majority of the current population—arrived nearly a thousand years ago, with the first arrivals dated to approximately 13th and 14th century. The Thule people were more technologically <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> their Dorset predecessors, although they still relied on subsistence hunting, with walruses, reindeer, and particularly the fur seals constituting the base of the economy in the early period.|$|E
5|$|According to Freitas, {{direct contact}} with civilizations {{significantly}} more <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> humanity {{would have to take}} place within the Solar System, as only the more advanced society would have the resources and technology to cross interstellar space. Consequently, such contact could only be with civilizations rated as Type II or higher on the Kardashev scale, as Type I civilizations would be incapable of regular interstellar travel. Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned by the more advanced civilization to avoid mass societal shock for humanity.|$|E
60|$|Although {{it seemed}} certain the enemy had been {{destroyed}} the Indian did not neglect any precaution. He traveled further in <b>advance</b> <b>than</b> usual {{and from time to}} time cast searching glances toward the valley where, in all probability, so many lay dead.|$|R

"The matter {{has been}} argued, Babs," [...] Lord Valleys said shortly; [...] "unless {{you have some}} better reason to <b>advance</b> <b>than</b> those of {{ordinary}} common sense, public spirit, and consideration for one's family, it will hardly be worth your while to reopen the discussion." ...|$|R
60|$|In truth, there {{appeared}} {{some reason to}} expect that such a result would follow from the encounter, for John Browdie no sooner saw Nicholas <b>advancing,</b> <b>than</b> he reined in his horse by the footpath, and waited {{until such time as}} he should come up; looking meanwhile, very sternly between the horse's ears, at Nicholas, as he came on at his leisure.|$|R
5|$|As hats {{go out of}} fashion, the {{anthropomorphic}} bear Popol the Hatter {{heads into}} the American West with his wife Virginia and blue donkey, Bluebell. Setting up camp {{in the land of}} the Bunnokee, a tribe of anthropomorphic rabbit Native Americans, he does good business there. This infuriates the Bunnokee medicine man, whose feather headdress business has declined as a result. He and the Chief of the Bunnokees conspire to eradicate the economic threat, launching war against Popol. Using technology that is more <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> the Bunnokee's bow and arrows, Popol defeats the rabbits' initial attacks, but they retaliate by abducting Virginia and threatening to torture her. Popol then rescues her, and together they escape, coming upon a river in which they discover gold.|$|E
5|$|New Age thought {{typically}} envisions {{the world}} as developing through cosmological cycles which can be identified astrologically. It adopts this concept from Theosophy, although often presents it in a looser and more eclectic way than is found in Theosophical teaching. New Age literature often claims that humanity once lived {{in an age of}} spiritual wisdom. In the writings of New Agers like Edgar Cayce, the ancient period of spiritual wisdom is associated with concepts of supremely-advanced societies living on lost continents such as Atlantis, Lemuria, and Mu, as well as the idea that ancient societies like those of Ancient Egypt were far more technologically <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> modern scholarship accepts.|$|E
5|$|Propaganda did {{not develop}} a {{negative}} connotation {{until it was}} used in Nazi propaganda for World War II. Even though Germany's World War I propaganda was considered more <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> that of other nations, Adolf Hitler said that propaganda had been under-utilized and claimed that superior British propaganda was {{the main reason for}} losing the war. Nazi Germany created the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda in March 1933, just after Nazis took power. The Nazi party took editorial control over newspapers, created their own news organizations and established Nazi-controlled news organizations in conquered regions. The Nazi party used posters, films, books and public speakers among other tactics.|$|E

25|$|The rapid {{retreat of}} the German Nineteenth Army {{resulted}} in swift gains for the Allied forces. The plans had envisaged greater resistance near the landing areas and underestimated transport needs. The consequent need for vehicle fuel outstripped supply, and this shortage {{proved to be}} a greater impediment to the <b>advance</b> <b>than</b> German resistance. As a result, several German formations escaped into the Vosges and Germany.|$|R
50|$|The Namur forts {{presented}} {{less of a}} {{check to}} the German <b>advance</b> <b>than</b> the Liège forts, as the Germans quickly assimilated the lessons of Liège and applied them to the nearly identical fortifications of Namur, but taken together the Belgian fortifications held the German advance for several days longer than the Germans had anticipated, allowing Belgium and France to mobilize, and preventing the Germans from falling on an unprepared Paris.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after taking}} office, McElroy formed a panel to {{investigate}} ABM issues. The panel examined the Army and Air Force projects, {{and found the}} Zeus program considerably more <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> Wizard. McElroy told the Air Force to stop work on ABM missiles and use Wizard funding {{for the development of}} long-range radars for early warning and raid identification. These were already under development as the BMEWS network. The Army was handed the job of actually shooting down the warheads, and McElroy gave them free hand to develop an ABM system as they saw fit, free of any range limitations.|$|E
5|$|The Eleventh Five-Year Plan of the Soviet Union {{delivered}} a disappointing result: {{a change in}} growth from 5 to 4%. During the earlier Tenth Five-Year Plan, they had tried to meet the target of 6.1% growth, but failed. Brezhnev was able to defer economic collapse by trading with Western Europe and the Arab World. The Soviet Union still out-produced the United States in the heavy industry sector during the Brezhnev era. Another dramatic result of Brezhnev's rule was that certain Eastern Bloc countries became more economically <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|The Phantom {{represented}} {{a significant improvement}} to the RAAF's ground attack capabilities. The F-4Es were more technologically <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> the Canberra, as they could fly at supersonic speeds, were equipped with air-to-air radar and missiles, and had an inertial navigation system, ground-attack computer and a cannon. The Phantoms were capable of operating in several roles; the RAAF primarily used them as strike aircraft. This role was selected to prepare aircrew to operate F-111s, and most training exercises were focused on tasks that the F-111s would {{also be able to}} perform.|$|E
40|$|As happens {{eight times}} a year, this week {{financial}} markets will again {{turn their attention}} to what, if any, change the Federal Reserve will make to its policy rate. Robin L. Lumsdaine discusses research on the anticipation of such decisions via the Fed funds futures markets, which indicates that markets “set up” much farther in <b>advance</b> <b>than</b> has been previously documented. This finding emphasizes the importance of clarity in central bank communications...|$|R

5|$|The {{more typical}} soldier types of the Gorn are the Initiates, Warriors and Guardians. The former {{are the basic}} troops of the Gorn forces, and while they can run on four legs, they fight on two with an {{automatic}} rifle called the Ravager. The Warriors are more advanced, and carry a variety of weaponry along with basic armor. The Guardian type differs {{in that it is}} a melee type, armed with a large energy axe. However, the energy from the axe can also produce a shield to protect the holder as well. They are more <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> both the Initiate and the Warrior classes in that they spend the vast majority of their time on two feet only. Of these fifteen classes, three were created to appear female.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the twelfth}} century, {{education}} within the Byzantine Greek population was more <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> in the West, particularly at primary school level, resulting in comparatively high literacy rates. Success came easily to Byzantine Greek merchants, who enjoyed {{a very strong}} position in international trade. Despite the challenges posed by rival Italian merchants, they held their own throughout {{the latter half of}} the Byzantine Empire's existence. The clergy also held a special place, not only having more freedom than their Western counterparts, but also maintaining a patriarch in Constantinople who was considered the equal of the pope. This position of strength had built up over time, for at the beginning of the Byzantine Empire, under Emperor Constantine the Great (r. 306–337), only a small part, about 10%, of the population was Christian.|$|E
5|$|Before 1600, a major {{war broke}} out in eastern North America among Native Americans; it was later called the Beaver Wars. Five American Indian Iroquois tribes confederated to battle against their neighbors. The Iroquois were opposed by a {{confederation}} of primarily Algonquian tribes including the Shawnee, Miami, Wea, Pottawatomie, and the Illinois. These tribes were significantly less <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> the Mississippian culture that had preceded them. The tribes were semi-nomadic, used stone tools rather than copper, and did not create the large-scale construction and farming works of their Mississippian predecessors. The war continued with sporadic fighting {{for at least a}} century as the Iroquois sought to dominate the expanding fur trade with the Europeans. They achieved this goal for several decades. During the war, the Iroquois drove the tribes from the Ohio Valley to the south and west. They kept control of the area for hunting grounds.|$|E
50|$|For {{the third}} {{straight}} year, the CrossFit Games began on the Wednesday before the traditional weekend events; however, the athletes were aware of this much further in <b>advance</b> <b>than</b> in the past. The Games have started with a swim every year since 2011, with this year's event consisting of 1,000 meters of swimming, much longer than in past years. The event consisted of three separate sections of open-water swimming coupled with kettlebell thrusters and burpees in the sand.|$|R
30|$|However, {{the gender}} bias in course {{selection}} was more distinguishable in <b>advance</b> science courses <b>than</b> <b>advanced</b> mathematics courses (Figs.  7 and 8). Figures  7 and 8 {{on the same}} scale in percentage show the detectable gender differences in Advanced Biology and Advanced Physics courses, and the differences were steadily increasing across years. While similar proportions of female and male students enrolled in Advanced Chemistry courses across years, more female students (6 -year average[*]=[*] 1.8 %) enrolled in <b>Advanced</b> Biology courses <b>than</b> male students (6 -year average[*]=[*] 1.2 %), and vice versa, more male students (6 -year average[*]=[*] 1.4 %) enrolled in <b>Advanced</b> Physics courses <b>than</b> female students (6 -year average[*]=[*] 0.9 %) (see Table  9).|$|R

5|$|Extraterrestrial {{technology}} could have profound {{impacts on the}} nature of human culture and civilization. Just as television provided a new outlet {{for a wide variety of}} political, religious, and social groups, and as the printing press made the Bible available to the common people of Europe, allowing them to interpret it for themselves, so an extraterrestrial technology might change humanity in ways not immediately apparent. Harrison speculates that a knowledge of extraterrestrial technologies could increase the gap between scientific and cultural progress, leading to societal shock and an inability to compensate for negative effects of technology. He gives the example of improvements in agricultural technology during the Industrial Revolution, which displaced thousands of farm laborers until society could retrain them for jobs suited to the new social order. Contact with an extraterrestrial civilization far more <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> humanity could cause a much greater shock than the Industrial Revolution, or anything previously experienced by humanity.|$|E
5|$|The Final Fantasy Legend {{takes place}} on several worlds {{centered}} around a large tower, built by the Creator in ancient times (God in the Japanese version) to link worlds. There are four unique major worlds that make up different layers of the tower: the World of Continent at the base, the World of Ocean on the 5th floor, the World of Sky on the 10th, and the World of Ruins on the 16th. Time does not flow at a constant pace between levels of the tower, rendering some worlds more technologically <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> others. Various monsters come forth from the tower into each world; many are hostile, {{but some of them}} are friendly to humans and willing to coexist. An offshoot of the human race (named mutants) also exists in each world; they are the magic-attuned descendants of a union between humans and the World of Continent's older races.|$|E
5|$|Thief was {{developed}} with the Dark Engine, a proprietary game engine. It was written during the game's development, {{rather than as}} a separately budgeted project, which led to time constraint issues. An emphasis was placed on simulating real life physics; arrows would arc through the air rather than fly straight. The engine features alpha blending, texture filtering and lighting techniques. Motion capture technology was integrated to allow for realistic character animation. The engine's renderer—which draws the graphics—was largely written by Looking Glass Studios programmer Sean Barrett in fall 1995. While the renderer was expected to be finished before the game's release date, Barrett left the company in 1996. He later performed contract work for the company, and assisted in writing features like hardware support. However, the renderer was never fully addressed, and was less <b>advanced</b> <b>than</b> others of the time.|$|E

50|$|During solar minima coronal {{holes are}} the primary sources of space weather disturbances. Typically, {{geomagnetic}} (and proton) storms originating from coronal holes have a gradual commencement (over hours) and are not as severe as storms caused by coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which usually have a sudden onset. Due to the fact coronal holes can last for several months, it is often possible to predict the recurrence {{of this type of}} disturbance significantly farther in <b>advance</b> <b>than</b> for CME related disturbances.|$|R
