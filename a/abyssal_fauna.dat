Removing parts of the sea floor could disturb the habitat of benthic organisms, with unknown long-term effects. Aside from the direct impact of mining the area, some researchers and environmental activists have raised concerns about leakage, spills and corrosion that could alter the mining area’s chemical makeup.|$|E

40|$|DSDP Site 516 {{contains}} a complete middle Eocene to lower Miocene interval with a well-developed Oligocene sequence {{that is more}} than 300 m thick. In this paper, the most important and characteristic benthic foraminiferal species from this interval are described and illustrated, and their quantitative and biostratigraphic distribution is given. Middle Eocene benthic assemblages, derived from pelagic intercalations in a partly turbiditic sequence, are low in diversity. Benthic assemblages of fairly high diversity occur in limestones, chalks, and oozes of the upper Eocene to lower Miocene. The consistently high rate of new species appearances at Site 516 during late Eocene and Oligocene contrasted greatly with the very slow rate of change in <b>abyssal</b> <b>faunas</b> at that time; there were no significant faunal changes at the Eocene/Oligocene boundary. The assemblages are dominated by Cibicidoides (mostly C. ungerianus or C. kullenbergi) and Lenticulina. Buliminids were also important during the Eocene and early Oligocene. Faunal comparison with other Atlantic DSDP sites and drill holes in the Gulf of Mexico suggest an approximately mid-bathyal (500 - 1500 m) depth of deposition during late Eocene and Oligocene...|$|R
40|$|Drilling at Site 786, {{located in}} the center of the Izu-Bonin forearc basin, {{penetrated}} an apparently continuous section of middle Eocene/lower Oligocene volcaniclastic breccias and nannofossil oozes. Planktonic foraminiferal faunas underwent a gradual transition from relatively high-diversity middle Eocene through late Eocene tropical or warm-water assemblages to a cooler-water, less diverse assemblage during the early Oligocene. In the cosmopolitan benthic foraminiferal faunas, the major transition occurred during the early late Eocene. Middle Eocene benthic assemblages resembling the bathyal 'Lenticulina' fauna (characterized by Osangularia mexicana, Cibicidoides eocaenus, and several buliminid species) changed to an upper Eocene <b>abyssal</b> 'Globocassidulina subglobosa' <b>fauna</b> (characterized by Cibicidoides praemundulus, Globocassidulina subglobosa, Gyroidinoides girardanus, Oridorsalis umbonatus, and Siphonodosaria aculeata). Even though no large, abrupt faunal changes appear to have been associated with the assumed Eocene/Oligocene boundary, benthic species turnover continued through the late Eocene and into the early Oligocene. This resulted in a slightly lower diversity early Oligocene fauna dominated by three species: Laevidentalina sp., Bulimina jarvisi, and Gyroidinoides girardanus. The progression from a middle Eocene bathyal 'Lenticulina' fauna, rather than an <b>abyssal</b> 'Nuttallides truempyi' <b>fauna,</b> to an <b>abyssal</b> 'Globocassidulina subglobosa' <b>fauna</b> during the early late Eocene, suggests that a bathymetric deepening occurred at Site 786.

40|$|The {{depth-related}} {{distribution of}} seastar (Echinodermata: Asteroidea) species between 150 and 4950 m in the Porcupine Seabight and Porcupine Abyssal Plain is described. 47 species of asteroid were identified from ~ 14, 000 individuals collected. The bathymetric range of each species is recorded. What are considered quantitative data, from an acoustically monitored epibenthic sledge and supplementary data from otter trawls, {{are used to}} display the relative abundance of individuals within their bathymetric range. Asteroid species are found to have very narrow centres of distribution {{in which they are}} abundant, despite much wider total adult depth ranges. Centres of distribution may be skewed. This might result from competition for resources or be related to the occurrence of favourable habitats at particular depths. The bathymetric distributions of the juveniles of some species extend outside the adult depth ranges. There is a distinct pattern of zonation with two major regions of faunal change and six distinct zones. An upper slope zone ranges from 150 to ~ 700 m depth, an upper bathyal zone between 700 and 1100 m, a mid-bathyal zone from 1100 to 1700 m and a lower bathyal zone between 1700 and 2500 m. Below 2500 m the lower continental slope and continental rise have a characteristic asteroid fauna. The abyssal zone starts at about 2800 m. Regions of major faunal change are identified at the boundaries of both upper and mid-bathyal zones and at the transition of bathyal to <b>abyssal</b> <b>fauna.</b> Diversity is greatest at ~ 1800 m, decreasing with depth to ~ 2600 m before increasing again to high levels at ~ 4700 m...|$|E
40|$|Shallow marine benthic {{communities}} around Antarctica show {{high levels of}} endemism, gigantism, slow growth, longevity and late maturity, as well as adaptive radiations that have generated considerable biodiversity in some taxa 1. The deeper parts of the Southern Ocean exhibit some unique environmental features, including a very deep continental shelf 2 and a weakly stratified water column, and are the source {{for much of the}} deep water in the world ocean. These features suggest that deep-sea faunas around the Antarctic may be related both to adjacent shelf communities and to those in other oceans. Unlike shallow-water Antarctic benthic communities, however, little is known about life in this vast deep-sea region 2, 3. Here, we report new data from recent sampling expeditions in the deep Weddell Sea and adjacent areas (748 – 6, 348 m water depth) that reveal high levels of new biodiversity; for example, 674 isopods species, of which 585 were new to science. Bathymetric and biogeographic trends varied between taxa. In groups such as the isopods and polychaetes, slope assemblages included species that have invaded from the shelf. In other taxa, the shelf and slope assemblages were more distinct. <b>Abyssal</b> <b>faunas</b> tended to have stronger links to other oceans, particularly the Atlantic, but mainly in taxa with good dispersal capabilities, such as the Foraminifera. The isopods, ostracods and nematodes, which are poor dispersers, include many species currently known only from the Southern Ocean.

40|$|Although the {{organization}} patterns of fauna {{in the deep}} sea have been broadly documented, most {{studies have focused on}} the megafauna. Bivalves represent about 10 % of the deep-sea macrobenthic fauna, being the third taxon in abundance after polychaetes and peracarid crustaceans. This study, based on a large data set, examined the bathymetric distribution, patterns of zonation and diversity–depth trends of bivalves from the Porcupine Seabight and adjacent Abyssal Plain (NE Atlantic). A total of 131, 334 individuals belonging to 76 species were collected between 500 and 4866 m. Most of the species showed broad depth ranges with some ranges extending over more than 3000 m. Furthermore, many species overlapped in their depth distributions. Patterns of zonation were not very strong and faunal change was gradual. Nevertheless, four bathymetric discontinuities, more or less clearly delimited, occurred at about 750, 1900, 2900 and 4100 m. These boundaries indicated five faunistic zones: (1) a zone above 750 m marking the change from shelf species to bathyal species; (2) a zone from 750 to 1900 m that corresponds to the upper and mid-bathyal zones taken together; (3) a lower bathyal zone from 1900 to 2900 m; (4) a transition zone from 2900 to 4100 m where the bathyal fauna meets and overlaps with the <b>abyssal</b> <b>fauna</b> and (5) a truly abyssal zone from approximately 4100 – 4900 m (the lower depth limit of this study), characterized by the presence of abyssal species with restricted depth ranges and a few specimens of some bathyal species with very broad distributions. The 4100 m boundary marked the lower limit of distribution of many bathyal species. There was a pattern of increasing diversity downslope from 500 to 1600 m, followed by a decrease to minimum values at about 2700 m. This drop in diversity was followed by an increase up to maximum values at 4100 m and then again, a fall to 4900 m (the lower depth limit in this study...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} impact and fate of the summer {{phytoplankton}} bloom on Antarctic benthos, we evaluated temporal and spatial patterns in macrofaunal abundance and taxonomic composition along a transect crossing the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) continental shelf As part of the FOODBANCS project, we sampled three sites at 550 - 625 m depths during five cruises occurring in November 1999, February-March 2000, June 2000, October 2000 and March 2001. We used a combination of megacore and box-core samplers to take 81 samples, and collected over 30, 000 macrofaunal individuals, {{one of the largest}} sampling efforts on the Antarctic shelf to date. Comparison of the two sampling methodologies (box core and megacore) indicates similar macrofaunal densities, but with significant differences in taxonomic composition, a reflection of the different spatial scales of sampling. Macrorfaunal abundances on the WAP shelf were relatively high compared to other Antarctic shelf settings. At two of the three sampling sites, macrofaunal abundance remained constant throughout the year, which is consistent with the presence of a sediment `food bank`. Differences were observed in taxonomic composition at the site closest to the coast (Station A), driven by higher abundances of subsurface-deposit feeders. A significant temporal response was observed in the ampharetid polychaetes at Station A, with an abundance peak in the late fall post-bloom period; this may have resulted from juvenile recruitment during the summer bloom. Familial composition of macrofaunal polychaetes on the WAP shelf is more closely related to deep-sea <b>abyssal</b> <b>fauna</b> than to other shelf regions, and we hypothesize that this is a result of both local ecological conditions (low temperatures) and a reflection of historical processes such as extinctions on the Antarctic shelf during previous glacial maxima followed by recolonization from the deep sea.

40|$|The abyssal {{depths of}} the polar oceans {{are thought to be}} low in {{diversity}} compared with the shallower polar shelves and temperate and tropical deep-sea basins. Our recent study on the gastropod fauna of the deep Southern Ocean gives evidence of the existence of a rich gastropod assemblage at abyssal depths. During the ANDEEP I and II expeditions to the southern Drake Passage, Northwestern Weddell Sea, and South Sandwich Trench, gastropods were collected by bottom and Agassiz trawls, epibenthic sledge, and multicorer, at 40 stations in depths between 127 and 5194 m. On the whole, 473 specimens, corresponding to 93 species of 36 families, were obtained. Of those, 414 specimens were caught below 750 m depth and refer to 84 (90 %) benthic species of 32 (89 %) families. Most families were represented by a single species only. The numerically dominant families were Skeneidac and Buccinidae (with 10 and I I species, respectively), Eulimidae and Trochidae (with 9 species each), and Turridae (6 species). Thirty-Seven benthic deep-sea species (44 %) were represented by a single specimen, and another 20 species (24 %) were found at a single station, suggesting that more than two thirds of Antarctic deep-sea gastropod species are very rare or have a very scattered distribution. Of the 27 species occurring at two or more deep-sea stations, 14 were collected with different gear. Approximately half of the deep-water species are new to science or have been recently described. The present investigation increases the total number of recorded benthic Antarctic deep-sea gastropods (below 750 m) from 115 to 177. The previously known depth ranges have been extended, often considerably, for 31 species. The collected deep-sea gastropods comprise both eurybathic shelf species (29 %) and apparently true deep-sea species (58 %); some of the latter may belong to a so far unknown Antarctic <b>abyssal</b> <b>fauna.</b> Geographical ranges of the collected Antarctic benthic deep-sea gastropod species appear limited, and all these 84 species seem endemic to Antarctica south of the Polar Front. Comparing diversity and abundances based on epibenthic sledge samples, there is no clear relationship between Antarctic deep-sea gastropod abundance and species richness with depth. However, both Antarctic and adjacent deep-sea areas are still far from being adequately sampled to allow more comprehensive conclusions...|$|E
40|$|Aim At {{the height}} of glaciations such as the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), benthic life on polar {{continental}} shelves was bulldozed off {{nearly all of the}} Antarctic shelf by grounded ice sheets. The origins of the current shelf benthos have become a subject of considerable debate. There are several possible sources for the current Antarctic shelf fauna, the first of which is the continental slope and deep sea of the Southern Ocean. The high levels of reported eurybathy for many Antarctic species are taken as evidence supporting this. A second possible source for colonists is the southern margins of other continents. Finally, shelves could have been recolonized from refugia on the continental shelves or slopes around Antarctica. The current study investigates whether the patchily rich and abundant biota that now occurs on the Antarctic continental shelf recolonized from refugia in situ or elsewhere. Location Weddell Sea, Antarctica. Methods We examined bryozoan samples of the BENDEX, ANDEEP III and SYSTCO expeditions, as well as the literature. Using similarity matrices (S circle divide rensen coefficient), we assessed similarities of benthos sampled from around Antarctica. By assessing numbers of species shared between differing depths and adjacent shelf areas, we evaluated the origins of cheilostome bryozoan communities. Results Bryozoans decreased from 28, 6. 5 and 0. 3 colonies per trawl, and 0. 16, 0. 046 and 0. 0026 colonies per cm 2 of hard surface from shelf to slope to abyssal depths. We found little and no support for recolonization of the Weddell Sea shelf by bryozoans from the adjacent slope and abyss, in the scenario of LGM faunal wipe-out. The Weddell Sea shelf bryozoan fauna was considerably more similar to those on other Antarctic shelves than to that of the adjacent (Weddell Sea) continental slope. The known bryozoan fauna of the Weddell Sea shelf is not a subset of the Weddell Sea slope or <b>abyssal</b> <b>faunas.</b> Main conclusions We consider that the composition of the current Weddell Sea bryozoan fauna is most easily explained by in situ survival. Thus we consider {{that at least some of}} the Weddell Sea fauna persisted throughout the LGM, although not necessarily at the same locations throughout, to recolonize the large area currently occupied. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{distribution}} and abundance of megafauna on a deep-water rocky reef (1796 – 2373 m) in the Fram Strait, west of Svalbard. Biodiversity and population density are high, with a maximum average of 26. 7 ± 0. 9 species m− 2 and 418. 1 ± 49. 6 individuals m− 2 {{on the east side}} of the reef summit.

The east side of the reef summit, where the highest richness and density of fauna are found, faces into the predominant bottom current, which likely increases in speed to the summit and serves as a source of particulate food for the numerous suspension feeders present there.

40|$|Canonical {{correspondence}} analysis {{indicates that the}} distribution of Neogene benthic foraminiferal faunas (> 63 µm) in seven DSDP and ODP sites (500 - 4500 m water depth) east of New Zealand (38 - 51 °S, 170 °E- 170 °W) is most strongly influenced by depth (water mass stratification), and secondly by age (palaeoceanographic changes influencing faunal composition and biotic evolution). Stratigraphic faunal changes are interpretted {{in terms of the}} pulsed sequential development of southern, and later northern, polar glaciation and consequent cooling of bottom waters, increased vertical and lateral stratification of ocean water masses, and increased overall and seasonal surface water productivity. Oligocene initiation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC), flowing northwards past New Zealand, resulted in extensive hiatuses throughout the Southwest Pacific, some extending through into the Miocene. Planktic foraminiferal fragmentation index values indicate that carbonate dissolution was significant at abyssal depths throughout most of the Neogene, peaking at upper abyssal depths in the late Miocene (11 - 7 Ma), with the lysocline progressively deepened thereafter. Miocene <b>abyssal</b> <b>faunas</b> are dominated by Globocassidulina subglobosa and Oridorsalis umbonatus, with increasing Epistominella exigua after 16 Ma at upper abyssal depths. Peak abundances of Epistominella umbonifera indicate increased input of cold Southern Component Water to the DWBC at 7 - 6 Ma. Faunal association changes imply establishment of the modern Oxygen Minimum Zone (upper Circumpolar Deep Water) in the latest Miocene. Significant latitudinal differences between the benthic foraminiferal faunas at lower bathyal depths indicate the existence of an oceanic front along the Chatham Rise (location of present Subtropical Front), since the early late Miocene at least, with more pulsed productivity (higher E. exigua) along the south side. Modern Antarctic Intermediate Water faunal associations were established north of the Chatham Rise at 10 - 9 Ma, and south of it at 3 - 1. 5 Ma. Middle-upper bathyal faunas on the Campbell Plateau are dominated by reticulate bolivinids during the early and middle Miocene, indicative of sustained productivity above relatively sluggish, suboxic bottom waters. Faunal changes and hiatuses indicate increased current vigour over the Campbell Plateau from the latest Miocene on. Surface water productivity (food supply) appears to have increased in three steps (at times of enhanced global cooling) marked by substantially increased relative abundance of: (1) Abditodentrix pseudothalmanni, Alabaminella weddellensis, Cassidulina norvangi (16 - 15 Ma, increased pulsed productivity); (2) Bulimina marginata f. aculeata, Nonionella auris, Trifarina angulosa, Uvigerina peregrina (3 - 1. 5 Ma, increased overall productivity); and (3) Cassidulina carinata (1 - 0. 5 Ma, increased overall productivity). Three intervals of deep-sea benthic foraminiferal taxonomic turnover are recognised (16 - 15, 11. 5 - 10, 2 - 0. 5 Ma) corresponding to intervals of enhanced global cooling and possible productivity changes. The late Pliocene-middle Pleistocene extinction, associated with increasing Northern Hemisphere glaciation, culminating in the middle Pleistocene climatic transition, was more significant in the study area than the earlier Neogene turnovers...|$|R
40|$|The Antarctic {{continental}} slope spans the depths {{from the shelf}} break (usually between 500 and 1000 m) to ~ 3000 m, is very steep, overlain by 'warm' (2 - 2. 5 °C) Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), and life there is poorly studied. This study investigates whether life on Antarctica's {{continental slope}} is essentially {{an extension of the}} shelf or the <b>abyssal</b> <b>fauna,</b> a transition zone between these or clearly distinct in its own right. Using data from several cruises to the Weddell Sea and Scotia Sea, including the ANDEEP (ANtarctic benthic DEEP-sea biodiversity, colonisation history and recent community patterns) I-III, BIOPEARL (Biodiversity, Phylogeny, Evolution and Adaptive Radiation of Life in Antarctica) 1 and EASIZ (Ecology of the Antarctic Sea Ice Zone) II cruises as well as current databases (SOMBASE, SCAR-MarBIN), four different taxa were selected (i. e. cheilostome bryozoans, isopod and ostracod crustaceans and echinoid echinoderms) and two areas, the Weddell Sea and the Scotia Sea, to examine faunal composition, richness and affinities. The answer has important ramifications to the link between physical oceanography and ecology, and the potential of the slope to act as a refuge and resupply zone to the shelf during glaciations. Benthic samples were collected using Agassiz trawl, epibenthic sledge and Rauschert sled. By bathymetric definition, these data suggest that despite eurybathy in some of the groups examined and apparent similarity of physical conditions in the Antarctic, the shelf, slope and abyssal faunas were clearly separated in the Weddell Sea. However, no such separation of faunas was apparent in the Scotia Sea (except in echinoids). Using a geomorphological definition of the slope, shelf-slope-abyss similarity only changed significantly in the bryozoans. Our results did not support the presence of a homogenous and unique Antarctic slope fauna despite a high number of species being restricted to the slope. However, it remains the case {{that there may be a}} unique Antarctic slope fauna, but the paucity of our samples could not demonstrate this in the Scotia Sea. It is very likely that various ecological and evolutionary factors (such as topography, water-mass and sediment characteristics, input of particulate organic carbon (POC) and glaciological history) drive slope distinctness. Isopods showed greatest species richness at slope depths, whereas bryozoans and ostracods were more speciose at shelf depths; however, significance varied across Weddell Sea and Scotia Sea and depending on bathymetric vs. geomorphological definitions. Whilst the slope may harbour some source populations for localised shelf recolonisation, the absence of many shelf species, genera and even families (in a poorly dispersing taxon) from the continental slope indicate that it was not a universal refuge for Antarctic shelf fauna...|$|E
40|$|Bathymetric {{biodiversity}} {{patterns of}} marine benthic invertebrates and demersal fishes {{have been identified}} in the extant fauna of the deep continental margins. Depth zonation is widespread and evident through a transition between shelf and slope fauna from the shelf break to 1000 m, and a transition between slope and <b>abyssal</b> <b>fauna</b> from 2000 to 3000 m; these transitions are characterised by high species turnover. A unimodal pattern of diversity with depth peaks between 1000 and 3000 m, despite the relatively low area represented by these depths. Zonation is thought to result from the colonisation of the deep sea by shallow-water organisms following multiple mass extinction events throughout the Phanerozoic. The effects of low temperature and high pressure act across hierarchical levels of biological organisation and appear sufficient to limit the distributions of such shallow-water species. Hydrostatic pressures of bathyal depths have consistently been identified experimentally as the maximum tolerated by shallow-water and upper bathyal benthic invertebrates at in situ temperatures, and adaptation appears required for passage to deeper water in both benthic invertebrates and demersal fishes. Together, this suggests that a hyperbaric and thermal physiological bottleneck at bathyal depths contributes to bathymetric zonation. The peak of the unimodal diversity–depth pattern typically occurs at these depths even though the area represented by these depths is relatively low. Although it is recognised that, over long evolutionary time scales, shallow-water diversity patterns are driven by speciation, little consideration has been given to the potential implications for species distribution patterns with depth. Molecular and morphological evidence indicates that cool bathyal waters are the primary site of adaptive radiation in the deep sea, and we hypothesise that bathymetric variation in speciation rates could drive the unimodal diversity–depth pattern over time. Thermal effects on metabolic-rate-dependent mutation and on generation times have been proposed to drive differences in speciation rates, which result in modern latitudinal biodiversity patterns over time. Clearly, this thermal mechanism alone cannot explain bathymetric patterns since temperature generally decreases with depth. We hypothesise that demonstrated physiological effects of high hydrostatic pressure and low temperature at bathyal depths, acting on shallow-water taxa invading the deep sea, may invoke a stress–evolution mechanism by increasing mutagenic activity in germ cells, by inactivating canalisation during embryonic or larval development, by releasing hidden variation or mutagenic activity, or by activating or releasing transposable elements in larvae or adults. In this scenario, increased variation at a physiological bottleneck at bathyal depths results in elevated speciation rate. Adaptation that increases tolerance to high hydrostatic pressure and low temperature allows colonisation of abyssal depths and reduces the stress–evolution response, consequently returning speciation of deeper taxa to the background rate. Over time this mechanism could contribute to the unimodal diversity–depth pattern...|$|E
40|$|Late Oligocene to late Pliocene {{vertical}} water-mass stratification along depth traverses in {{the northern}} Indian Ocean is depicted in this paper by benthic foraminifer index faunas. During most of this time, benthic faunas indicate well-oxygenated, bottom-water conditions at all depths except under the southern Indian upwelling and in the Pliocene in the southern Arabian Sea. Faunas suggest the initiation of lower oxygen conditions at intermediate depths {{in the northern}} Indian Ocean beginning in Oligocene Zone P 21 a. Lower oxygen conditions intensified during primary productivity pulses, possibly related to increased upwelling vigor, in the latest Oligocene and {{throughout most of the}} late middle through late Miocene. During times of elevated primary production, there may be more oxygen flux into sedimentary pore waters and the shallow infaunal habitat may become more oxygenated. One criterion for locating the source of "new" water masses is vertical homogeneity of benthic foraminifer indexes for well-oxygenated water masses from intermediate through abyssal depths. In the northern Mascarene Basin, this type of faunal homogeneity with depth corroborates the proposal that the northern Indian Ocean was an area of sinking well-oxygenated waters through most of the Miocene before Zone N 17. Oxygenated, possibly "new" intermediate-water masses in the low- to middle-latitude Mascarene and Central Indian basins first developed in the late Oligocene. These well-oxygenated waters were probably more fertile than the Antarctic Intermediate Waters (AAIW) that cover intermediate depths in these areas today. Production of intermediate waters more similar to modern AAIW is indicated by the sparse benthic population of epifaunal rotaloid species in the northern Mascarene Basin during middle Miocene Zone N 9 and from early through late Pliocene time. Deep-water characteristics are more difficult to interpret because of the extensive redeposition at the deeper sites. Redeposited intermediate, rather than shallow, water fossils and erosion from north to south in the Mascarene Basin are incompatible with the sluggish circulation from south to north through the western Indian Ocean basins today. Such erosion could result from the vigorous sinking of an intermediate-depth water mass of northern origin. Before late Oligocene Zone P 22, benthic faunas indicate a twofold subdivision of the troposphere, with the boundary between upper and lower well-oxygenated water masses located from 2500 - 3000 mbsl. No characteristic bottom-water fauna developed before the end of late Oligocene Zone P 22. Deep and abyssal benthic indexes suggest the development of water masses {{similar to those of the}} present day in the latest Miocene. Faunas containing deep-water benthic indexes, including the uvigerinids, suggestive of a water mass similar to modern Indian Deep Water (IDW), appeared during the late Miocene in the northern Mascarene and Central Indian basins. In the early Pliocene, this deep-water fauna was found only in the Central Indian Basin, whereas a fauna typical of modern Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) spread through deep waters at 2800 mbsl in the Mascarene Basin. By late Pliocene Zone N 21, however, deep-water faunas similar to their modern analogs were developed in both the eastern and western basins. <b>Abyssal</b> <b>faunas,</b> studied only in the Mascarene Basin, show more or less similarity to those under modern AABW. Bottom-water faunas containing Nuttallides umbonifera or Epistominella exiguua were first differentiated at the end of Zone P 22, then appeared episodically during the early Miocene. These AABW-type faunas reappeared and migrated updepth into deep waters during the glacial episodes at the end of the Miocene and at the beginning of the Pliocene. By late Pliocene Zone N 21, however, a bottom-water fauna similar to that under eastern Indian Bottom Water (IBW) developed in the Mascarene Basin. Modern bottom-water characteristics of the Mascarene Basin must have developed after ZoneN 21...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} survey of ‘live’ (stained) and dead monothalamous (single-chambered, mainly spherical) and pseudochambered (chain-like) foraminifera {{associated}} with planktonic foraminiferal shells and mineral grains, based on two samples from one abyssal plain site (F 2, 4, 880 m water depth) and one abyssal hill site (H 4, 4, 330 m water depth) on the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (PAP), northeast Atlantic. Our study {{is the first to}} focus on this poorly known component of <b>abyssal</b> foraminiferal <b>faunas</b> and highlight their abundances and diversity at the PAP. In both samples these monothalamids and pseudochambered forms represented 27 – 35 % and 18 – 23 %, respectively, of the entire ‘live’ and dead foraminiferal assemblage (> 150 ?m, 0 – 1 cm sediment layer). Among 1, 078 stained and dead specimens we recognise a total of 18 distinct morphotypes on the basis of test characteristics. Another 144 specimens could not be assigned to any morphotype and are regarded as indeterminate. Most of the monothalamids are small (< 150 ?m), although some incorporate planktonic foraminiferal shells to create larger structures. In absolute terms, stained and dead individuals of these morphotypes were more abundant at the abyssal hill site, although data from additional samples are needed to confirm if this is representative of differences between abyssal hills and the surrounding abyssal plain at the PAP. Agglutinated spheres and domes similar to some of our abyssal forms have been reported from shelf and slope settings, but they are generally much larger. Small agglutinated spheres are very common in the abyssal Pacific, at depths close to or below the carbonate compensation depth (CCD). However, they are composed largely of siliceous particles, including mineral grains, radiolarians and diatom fragments. In contrast, carbonate oozes at the PAP, situated above the CCD, are rich in coccoliths and planktonic foraminiferal shells, which are used in the construction of agglutinated spheres and domes. Our results underline the important contribution made by largely underestimated foraminiferal taxa to abyssal communities...|$|R
40|$|The {{deep sea}} {{is a dynamic}} {{environment}} over various spatio-temporal scales. But, the characteristics of deep-sea natural variations and underlying processes remain poorly understood, which prevents contextualising any anthropogenic impact on this environment. Long-term observations, from which inter-annual variations can be detected, as well as detailed broad-scale spatial observations, are scarce in the deep sea. In this thesis, I examined changes in both spatial (~ 0. 1 - 10 s km scale) and temporal (inter-annual scale) domains in <b>abyssal</b> benthic <b>fauna</b> at two <b>abyssal</b> stations in the North East Pacific (Station M, 1991 to 2011) and in the North East Atlantic (Porcupine Abyssal Plain, PAP, 1991 to 2012) using Polychaeta as study organisms. Four main results were found. 1) At intermediate scales (0. 1 to 10 s km), the macrofauna and polychaete family composition {{were related to the}} sediment grain size distribution (Chapter 2). Differences in sediment grain size distribution between and among abyssal hills created habitat heterogeneity. Differences in near-bed current flows, and thus in particle size and food settling conditions, may be the primary factors influencing the sediment particle size distribution and macrofauna. Overall polychaetes and macrofauna may be more spatially variable than previously thought in abyssal areas when considering that abyssal hills might {{be one of the most}} common topographic features on Earth. 2) At inter-annual scale, polychaete families and functional groups varied in density, diversity and community structure at Sta. M and PAP (chapter 3). Sub-surface deposit feeders, such as Paraonidae, dominated the North East Pacific, whereas surface deposit feeders, such as Cirratulidae, dominated the North East Atlantic. Differences may be related to the quantity and quality of the particulate organic carbon reaching the seafloor. Overall, changes in the dominance of functional groups imply changes in abyssal ecosystem functioning. 3) At inter-annual scale, the dynamics of polychaete abundances and body sizes suggested that migration/enhanced survivorship and recruitment events occurred (chapter 4). The densities and median body sizes of the five density-dominant species at Sta. M were analysed over time to help elucidate population dynamics as population parameters such as reproduction or growth rate could not be directly measured. The results indicated that the density dynamics of Paradoneis cf. lyra may have be related to enhanced survivorship or immigration of adult individuals, while the density dynamics of Cossura cf. rostrata may have be linked to individuals shifting between growth and reproduction. 4) At inter-annual scale, Sta. M polychaete changes were detected in standing stocks, rank distributions, species and functional group composition (chapter 5). Although a change in sampling location occurred after 2005, preventing ascribing the assemblage change unequivocally to particular environmental drivers, analyses prior to 2005 showed that the polychaete assemblage composition dynamics were primary driven by food supply variation. Overall, energetic zero-sum dynamics were not clearly observed at polychaete assemblage level, but were evident in the greater macrofauna community that includes the polychaetes. Polychaete displayed stability in body size structure in space and time, following the predictions of the metabolic theory of ecology. In conclusion, this work highlighted that abyssal polychaete communities can change over spatial scales of tens of square kilometres and time scales of months or more; this work found a large but as yet underappreciated variability. <br/...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} Oligocene {{and early}} Miocene benthic foraminiferal faunas (> 105 µm in size) from Ocean Drilling Program (Leg 199) Site 1218 (4826 m water depth and ~ 3300 to ~ 4000 m paleo-water depth) and Site 1219 (5063 m water depth and ~ 4200 to ~ 4400 m paleo-water depth) {{to understand the}} response of abyssal benthic foraminifera to mid-Oligocene glacial events in the eastern Equatorial Pacific Ocean. Two principal factor assemblages were recognized. The Factor 1 assemblage (common Nuttallides umbonifer) is related to either an influx of the Southern Component Water (SCW), possibly carbonate undersaturated, or a decrease in seasonality of the food supply from the surface ocean. The Factor 2 assemblage is characterized by typical deep-sea taxa living under variable trophic conditions, possibly with a seasonal component in food supply. The occurrence of <b>abyssal</b> benthic foraminifera <b>faunas</b> during the mid-Oligocene depends on either the effect of SCW or the seasonality of food resources. The Factor 1 assemblage was most common near 76 Ol-C 11 r, 73 Ol-C 10 rn and 67 Ol-C 9 n (ca. 30. 2, 29. 1 and 26. 8 Ma respectively by Pälike et al. (2006, doi: 10. 1126 /science. 1133822)). This indicates {{that the effect of}} SCW increased or the seasonal input of food from the surface ocean to benthic environments was weakened close to these glacial events. In contrast, the huge export flux of small biogenic carbonate particles close to these glacial events might be responsible for carbonate-rich sediments buffering carbonate undersaturation. Changes in deep-water masses or the periodicity of food supply from the surface ocean and variation in surface carbonate production affected by orbital forcing {{had an impact on the}} mid-Oligocene <b>faunas</b> of <b>abyssal</b> benthic foraminifera around the intervals of glacial events in the eastern Equatorial Pacific Ocean. The Factor 1 assemblage decreased sharply at ? 30 Ma (29. 8 Ma by Pälike et al. (2006), 30. 0 Ma by CK 95) and returned to dominance after ? 29 Ma (28. 6 Ma by Pälike et al. (2006), 28. 8 Ma by CK 95). It is likely that the effect of SCW (possibly carbonate undersaturated) has intensified since the late Oligocene. The faunal transition of benthic foraminifera in the eastern Equatorial Pacific Ocean at ~ 29 Ma might be attributable to the influence of Northern Component Water (NCW) input to the Southern Ocean and the subsequent formation of SCW at about that time...|$|R
