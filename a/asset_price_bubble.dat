5|$|Skyscrapers are a {{relatively}} recent phenomenon in Japan. Due to aesthetic and engineering concerns, Japan's Building Standard Law set an absolute height limit of 31metres until 1963, when the limit was abolished {{in favor of a}} Floor Area Ratio limit. Following these changes in building regulations, the Kasumigaseki Building was constructed and completed in 1968. Double the height of Japan's previous tallest buildingthe 17-story Hotel New Otani Tokyothe Kasumigaseki Building is regarded as Japan's first modern high-rise building, rising 36stories and 156metres (512ft) in height. A booming post-war Japanese economy and the hosting of the 1964 Summer Olympics helped lead to a building boom in Tokyo during the 1960s and 1970s. Construction continued through the 1980s and 1990s as the Japanese <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> <b>bubble</b> rose and fell. Mainland Tokyo is divided into two sections: Western Tokyo and the special wards of Tokyo. All of the prefecture's tallest buildings are within the 23special wards, which comprise the area formerly incorporated as Tokyo City. Nishi-Shinjuku, a district within Shinjuku, was the prefecture's first major skyscraper development area. Starting with the construction of the Keio Plaza Hotel in the 1971, the district is now home to 11 of Tokyo's 40tallest skyscrapers.|$|E

After pressure from the finance ministry, the government compensated for these cuts by announcing an increase in the consumption tax from 3% to 7%, effective from 1997.

Hosokawa announced the increase but retracted the announcement the next day, leaving the tax at 3%. The government's response to the issue weakened its hold on power and was said to hasten its demise. The tax was eventually increased to 5% in 1997 by LDP Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.|$|E

The remnants of the faction, formally known by this time as Heisei Kenkyūkai (Heisei Research Council), remained active under the leadership of Yūji Tsushima, who resigned prior to the 2009 general election, passing control to Fukushiro Nukaga. The faction raised much less in donations during the 1990s and 2000s than it did under Tanaka and Takeshita in the 1980s, as electoral reforms enacted in 1994, coupled with new campaign finance regulations and the ongoing economic slump that followed the Japanese <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> <b>bubble,</b> weakened the power of factions in Japanese politics.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} Mitsubishi {{had seen}} {{because of its}} strong presence in south-east Asia reversed themselves {{as a result of}} the economic crisis in the region which began in 1991 with the advent of the collapse of the Japanese <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> <b>bubble,</b> referred to in Japan as the beginning of the Lost Decade and continued to 1997. The collapse was partly the result of the Plaza Accord agreement in 1985, which sought to equalize the United States dollar with the Japanese yen and the German mark. In September of that year the company closed its Thai factory in response to a crash in the country's currency and plummeting consumer demand. The large truck plant, which had produced 8,700 trucks in 1996, was shut down indefinitely. In addition, Mitsubishi had little support from sales in Japan, which slowed considerably throughout 1997 and were affected by that country's own economic uncertainty into 1998. Other Japanese automakers, such as Toyota and Honda, bolstered their own slipping domestic sales with success in the U.S. However, with a comparatively small percentage of the American market, the impact of the turmoil in the Asian economy had a greater effect on Mitsubishi, and the company's 1997 losses were the worst in its history. In addition, it lost both its rank as the third largest automaker in Japan to Mazda, and market share overseas. Its stock price fell precipitously, prompting the company to cancel its year-end dividend payment.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> <b>bubbles</b> in a {{continuous}} time model using the local martingale framework. Providing careful de…nitions of the asset’s market and fundamental price, we characterize all possible <b>price</b> <b>bubbles</b> in an incomplete market satisfying the "no free lunch with vanishing risk (NFLVR) " and "no dominance " assumptions. We show that the two leading models for bubbles as either charges or as strict local martingales, respectively, are equivalent. We propose a new theory for bubble birth which involves a nontrivial modi…cation of the classical martingale pricing framework. This modi…cation involves the market exhibiting di¤erent local martingale measures across time- a possibility not previously explored within the classical theory. Finally, we investigate the pricing of derivative securities {{in the presence of}} <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> <b>bubbles,</b> and we show that: (i) European put options can have no bubbles, (ii) European call options and discounted forward <b>prices</b> have <b>bubbles</b> whose magnitudes are related to the <b>asset’s</b> <b>price</b> <b>bubble,</b> (iii) with no dividends, American call options are not exercised early, (iv) European put-call parity in market prices must always hold, regardless of bubbles, and (v) futures <b>price</b> <b>bubbles</b> can exist and they are independent of the underlying <b>asset’s</b> <b>price</b> <b>bubble.</b> Many of these results stand in contrast to those of the classical theory.

The <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> <b>bubbles</b> are assessed on the basis of relevant price indices developments without examining the underlying fundamentals.

By 1994, the LS 400's U.S. base price exceeded , a figure that had steadily risen since the vehicle's introduction.
