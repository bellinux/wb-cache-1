The duration of the cylinder can be calculated with this formula: volume (in liters) * pressure (in bars) / 40 - 10 in minutes (the 10 is subtracted to provide a safety margin), so a 6-liter cylinder, of 300bar, is 6 X 300 / 40 - 10 = 35 minutes working duration. The relative fitness, and especially the level of exertion of the wearer, often results in variations of the actual usable time that the SCBA can provide air, often reducing the working time by 25% to 50%.|$|R

5000|$|The brake van in the {{passenger}} trains (usually {{the first and last}} coaches in the train) is a part of a coach and consists of an enclosed room/cabin with two small seats faced opposite to each other, one seat having the writing table for the guard to assist writing and working his train, the opposite seat being a spare. The van also has a small lavatory. A special feature of {{the passenger}} brake van is a small dog box where passengers can carry their pets along with them while they travel in the same train in a different coach. The guard generally remains responsible for the water and pet food while the train is moving, and there are features to the dog box to allow the same. The brake van also contains a stretcher, an emergency train lighting box, and a stand to hold the lamp signal during the night. The vacuum or <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> is hosted in front of the guard's seat with a lever to operate it in case of emergency. The hand brake can be used in case of high emergency. The remaining part of the coach consists of space for carrying parcels and small goods. It also has seating for ladies or for the disabled (wheelchair friendly).|$|E
5000|$|A - Air : Fully open {{cylinder}} valve. The {{practice of}} closing by a quarter-turn is recommended by some instructors as {{it leaves the}} valve easy to turn, which allows a quick check to ensure it is not closed. A fully open valve may be damaged if the cylinder is empty and someone tries to open it, thinking it is tightly closed, as may happen if the cylinder is empty. However, this practice has been widely discouraged, after several fatalities, including that of famous cave diver Sheck Exley, were attributed to divers mistakenly closing the valve and then opening a quarter turn. (This means that adequate airflow may be delivered at the surface, but restricted at depth due to increased air density.) Breathe the air through the regulators {{to ensure that it}} is fresh and dry: impure air is extremely dangerous underwater, but can usually be recognized through an unpleasant, often oily, taste or smell. Test operation of primary and secondary regulators. Both should breathe comfortably, and not 'free-flow' when purged. Make sure you check SPG when test breathing through regulators when breathing the <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> should not drop. Check hoses for damage. Ensure that the secondary regulator (the 'octopus') is attached in the triangle between the chin and the base of the ribs, and can be released easily: this ensures easy access for a buddy {{in the event of an}} emergency.|$|E

30|$|The kick {{injection}} system {{is made up}} of an air compressor supply, a gas flow meter, a pressure sensor, a solenoid valve, and a check valve. The air compressor compresses air into an <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> vessel and automatically shuts off at a pre-programmed pressure. The pressure vessel is equipped with a valve and a <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> to discharge the <b>pressured</b> <b>air</b> and monitor the pressure in the vessel respectively during the experiment. The <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> in the vessel is maintained between 120 and 150  psi.|$|R
40|$|Testing of the {{prototype}} valve began during this quarter. The {{objective of the}} first preliminary tests {{was to determine the}} pressure drop that can be created across the valve under different conditions of flow and pressure. As described in Quarterly Report 3, the system uses pneumatic pressure to activate a cylinder which in turn loads two hydraulic cylinders containing the MR fluid. Testing was preformed with no sensors or gauges other than the <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> supply <b>gauge.</b> The valve was powered at 36 volts and drew about 3. 5 amps. The valve held back the MR fluid at 30 psi. (This is the <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> required to get the cylinders to move without any flow obstruction.) The <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> was then increased gradually until the valve could no longer hold back the MR pressure and the cylinders moved slowly. The maximum <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> that could be held without movement of the cylinders was 85 psi; however. as much as 30 psi of this pressure may be required to overcome stiction. Thus, the maximum pressure we were able to stop was somewhere between 55 and 85 psi of air. This translates into 1500 to 2330 psi MR fluid pressure. Based on the ratio of the piston area to that of the MR damper valve, this in turn translates to a force of 9, 700 to 15, 000 pounds. A force of this magnitude is what is required for operation of the damper under typical downhole conditions. Initial testing indicates that a valve capable of producing the required damping under the anticipated downhole conditions is technically feasible. The project is progressing, but behind schedule, and a four-month extension of Phase I is being requested. This extension will not alter the budget for Phase I and is expected to have no significant effect upon the overall program schedule or budget...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the feasibility of building a simple and inexpensive device to preserve organs or tissues in hyperbaric and hypothermic conditions. Methods. the device was built on a 40 -cm wide, 28 -cm long, and 23 -cm deep stainless steel chassis. the pressure vessel was built by a 7. 8 -cm bore stainless steel cylinder put inside another 12 -cm cylinder welded together and closed by a steel plate on the top and bottom. the inferior plate was welded, and the superior one was fixed by manual clasp nut. the cooling system is made up of air compressor, condenser, expansion area, and cooling worm that is located between the cylinders. the temperature-controlling device is a computer processor contained in an integrated-circuit chip, with a on-off system to maintain the chamber temperature between 2 degrees to 4 degrees C. the compression of the chamber is performed by lateral coupling with the oxygen cylinder and is maintained at 5. 5 absolute atmospheres and controlled by <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge.</b> the maximal work pressure was evaluated by spreadsheet. Temperature or pressure changes were evaluated by 12 - and 24 -hour assays. Results. the maximal work pressure permitted was 6. 5 absolute atmospheres. Thus, the container was free from danger. the temperature inside the chamber was kept between 2 degrees and 4 degrees C. the production costs of the prototype was US$ 1000. Discussion. the manufacture of the refrigerating hyperbaric chamber is viable, simple, and inexpensive.

Two concrete mixtures were designed according to the same recipe; however, two different aggregates with the same volume fraction were used.
