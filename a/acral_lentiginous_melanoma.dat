40|$|Studies {{surveying}} melanomas {{associated with}} melanocytic nevi in Asia are rare. In this study, we examined whether nevus-associated melanomas differ from de novo melanomas {{in terms of}} their associations with clinical factors, histologic characteristics, and patient survival in Taiwan. Using data on cancer cases obtained from the Department of Pathology archives and the Cancer Registry of National Taiwan University Hospital, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 103 consecutive melanoma patients who were diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 and received follow-up through November 2016. Approximately 17. 5 % of the melanomas in question were associated with a nevus. In patients under 65 years of age, non-acral <b>lentiginous</b> <b>melanomas</b> were significantly associated with a higher percentage of nevus-associated melanomas. The superficial spreading subtype, younger patient age, thinner tumor, intermittent solar exposure, and early stage were significant predictors of a melanoma being histologically associated with a nevus. The appearance of a nevus associated with a melanoma predicted better recurrence-free survival compared with de novo <b>melanomas.</b> Although <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> <b>melanomas</b> (70. 9 %) constituted the most common histologic subtype, only 9. 6 % of the <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> <b>melanomas</b> were associated with a nevus. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference between the nevus-associated and de novo <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> <b>melanomas</b> with regard to clinicopathological factors and survival. In conclusion, nevus-associated melanomas were uncommon among <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> <b>melanomas.</b> Relatedly, because over half of all melanomas in Asians are <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> <b>melanomas,</b> Asians are less likely than Caucasians to have nevus-associated melanomas...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aim. Melanoma is a {{heterogeneous}} disease {{of skin and}} mucous membranes which shows significant increase in incidence worldwide in the past decades. In the process of forming new blood vessels stimulators of angiogenesis participate. There is an increase production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-C and VEGF-D), which expression cause change of endothelial cells, and higher degree of tumor's aggressiveness. The aim {{of this research was}} to determine the level of VEGF expression in skin melanoma in different body regions and in different primary stages of the disease. Methods. The research was conducted on bioptic materials of skin in 39 patients. On excision-made materials a routine histological preparation was done and following parameters were determined: histological type, alteration thickness (according to Breslow), Clark level, TNM (Tumor Nodus Metastasis) stage (pT), alteration width, thickness of lymphocytic infiltration in the tumor, mitotic index, phase of the tumor growth, presence of ulcerations, cellular type of the tumor, localization and level of VEGF expression. Results. Analysis confirmed that 61. 54 % of skin melanoma showed a high VEGF expression. Nodular and <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> <b>melanomas</b> showed more frequently a high level of VEGF expression, while superficial spreading melanoma showed a lower level of VEGF expression (p = 0. 032, p < 0. 05). A higher level of expression was present in thicker melanomas (higher in the Breslow stage; p = 0. 011, p < 0. 05). The width of the lesion did not have an influence on the level of VEGF expression in melanoma (U = 142. 000, p = 0. 273). Conclusion. Melanomas show a higher level of VEGF expression. Nodular and <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> types of <b>melanoma</b> show a high level of VEGF expression, while superficial spreading melanoma shows a lower level of VEGF expression.

40|$|The genetic {{background}} of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) includes both germ line aberrations in high-penetrance genes, like CDKN 2 A, and allelic variation in low-penetrance genes like the melanocortin- 1 receptor gene, MC 1 R.

We investigated MC 1 R and CDKN 2 A variation in relation to phenotype, clinical factors and CMM risk in the Swedish population. The study cohort consisted of sporadic primary melanoma patients, familial melanoma patients and a control group. An allele-dose dependent increase in melanoma risk for carriers of variant MC 1 R alleles (after adjusting for phenotype), with an elevated risk among familial CMM patients, was observed. This elevated risk was found to be significantly associated with an increased frequency of dysplastic nevi (DN) among familial patients compared to sporadic patients. MC 1 R variation was found to be less frequent among <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> <b>melanomas</b> (ALM) and dependent on tumour localisation. No association was found between CDKN 2 A gene variants and general melanoma risk. Two new variants in the POMC gene were identified in red haired individuals without RHC alleles...|$|R

40|$|One hundred twenty-two {{clinically}} Stage I {{malignant melanoma}} patients were treated prospectively in a nonrandomized trial by hyperthermic isolation perfusion with l-phenylalanine mustard (l-Pam), regional lymphadenectomy (RL), and wide local excision (WLE) between April 1965 and July 1980. There were 31 males and 91 females. All primary lesions were retrospectively microstaged by Clark's levels and Breslow's thickness criteria {{by one of}} the senior authors. Morphologically, 71 % were superficial spreading melanomas (SSM), 16. 5 % were nodular melanomas (NM), and 11. 9 % were <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> <b>melanomas.</b> Survival by microstaging and morphology are reported in Table 1. Eighty-one per cent of all patients were disease-free at five years. Twenty-three patients (18. 8 %) recurred and of these, 15 died of their disease. This included six of the seven patients with histologically positive lymph nodes. Complications were not only acceptable but preventable and will be discussed. Microstaging provides a valid basis by which to compare treatment regimens and, more importantly, a valid criteria by which to select treatment for a given patient. These data compare favorably with other reported series. At the time these studies were initiated, five-year survivals for clinically Stage I and II melanoma were roughly 55 % and 15 %, respectively.

40|$|Expression of β 2 {{microglobulin}} (β 2 M), a {{light chain}} of class 1 HLA antigen, was studied in normal melanocytes and in benign and malignant melanocytic tumors {{by use of}} immunohistochemical methods. By immunoelectron microscopy, normal melanocytes were shown to express β 2 M on the cell surface. In lentigo maligna <b>melanomas</b> and <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> <b>melanomas,</b> the mean percentages of β 2 M-positive tumor cells were significantly lower in thick (> 1. 50 mm) primary lesions and metastases than in thin (≦ 1. 50 mm) primary lesions. The evidence suggests that melanocyte-derived melanoma clones with a low grade of malignancy preserve class 1 HLA expression, and that the clones with a high grade of malignancy tend to lose the antigen expression. Nevus cells in common nevi {{have little or no}} expression of β 2 M. In halo nevi, however, were detected on nevus cells in the lesions associated with inflammatory infiltration. Immunohis-tochemical analyses of the cellular composition of the inflammatory cells in halo nevi demonstrated the presence of cytotoxic T cells together with helper/inducer T cells, Langerhans cells, and macrophages. It appears that nevus cells of halo nevi are destroyed by cytotoxic T cells and that class 1 HLA antigens expressed on nevus cells {{play an important role in}} the target cell recognition and lysis by specific cytotoxic T cells.

40|$|Background: Thin melanomas (Breslow {{thickness}} <= 1 mm) {{are considered}} highly curable. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the correlation between histological tumour regression and sentinel lymph node (SLN) involvement in thin melanomas. Patients and methods: This was a retrospective single-centre study of 34 patients with thin melanomas undergoing SLN biopsy between April 1998 and January 2005. Results: The study included 14 women and 20 men of mean age 56. 3 years. Melanomas were located on the neck (n = 3), soles (n = 4), trunk (n = 13) and extremities (n = 14). Pathological examination showed 25 SSM, four <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> <b>melanomas,</b> three in situ melanomas, one nodular melanoma and one unclassified melanoma with a mean Breslow thickness of 0. 57 mm. Histological tumour regression was observed in 26 over 34 cases and ulceration was found in one case. Clark levels were as follows: I (n = 3), II (n = 20), III (n = 9), IV (n = 2). Growth phase was available in 15 cases (seven radial and eight vertical). Mitotic rates, available in 24 cases, were: 0 (n = 9), 1 (n = 11), 2 (n = 2), 3 (n = 1), 6 (n = 1). One patient with histological tumour regression (2. 9 % of cases and 3. 8 % of cases with regressing tumours) had a metastatic SLN. One patient negative for SLN had a lung relapse and died of the disease. Mean follow-up was 26. 2 months. Conclusion: The results of the present study and the analysis of the literature show that histological regression of the primary tumour does not seem predictive of higher risk of SLN involvement in thin melanomas. This suggests that screening for SLN is not indicated in thin melanomas, even those with histological regression...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{phospholipase}} D plays a crucial part in the signal transduction of many types of cells, and is activated by protein kinase C α when cells are stimulated. To elucidate the role of phospholipase D in melanoma, the expression of phospholipase D 1 and protein kinase C α in primary and metastatic lesions of <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> <b>melanoma</b> and superficial spreading melanoma was investigated using immunohistologic techniques. In addition, the mechanism of regulation of phospholipase D 1 by protein kinase C α was examined in a human melanoma cell line HM 3 KO using an adenovirus-mediated gene transfer technique. Both phospholipase D 1 and protein kinase C α were strongly expressed in primary and metastatic lesions of superficial spreading melanoma. Conversely, in <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> <b>melanoma</b> lesions, the expression of these two proteins increased dramatically with tumor progression; the expression of both phospholipase D 1 and protein kinase C α was almost negative in the radial growth phase of primary <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> <b>melanoma</b> lesions, and increased synchronously in a progression-related manner in advanced <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> <b>melanoma</b> lesions, including vertical growth phase and metastatic lesions. Immunoprecipitation study showed that phospholipase D 1 and protein kinase C α are associated physiologically in resting melanoma cells. Further immunoprecipitation study using HM 3 KO cells after adenovirus-mediated simultaneous overexpression of phospholipase D 1 and protein kinase C α, or phospholipase D 1 and the kinase-negative mutant of protein kinase C α revealed that both protein kinase C α and the kinase-negative mutant of protein kinase C α are associated with phospholipase D 1 in melanoma cells {{in the absence of an}} external signal. Overexpression of protein kinase C α or the kinase-negative mutant of protein kinase C α in melanoma cells by the adenovirus vectors resulted in the enhancement of basal phospholipase D activity in a viral concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, enhanced basal phospholipase D activity increased the in vitro invasive potential of HM 3 KO cells. These results suggest that upregulation of phospholipase D 1 and protein kinase C α plays a part in the progression of <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> <b>melanoma</b> from the radial growth phase to the vertical growth phase. The present results also suggest that protein kinase C α associates with phospholipase D 1 and enhances basal phospholipase D activity in a protein phosphorylation-independent manner in melanoma cells, which contributes to the cell's high invasive potential...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundPopulation-based data on {{melanoma}} survival {{are important}} for understanding the impact of demographic and clinical factors on prognosis. ObjectiveWe describe melanoma survival by age, sex, race/ethnicity, stage, depth, histology, and site. MethodsUsing Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data, we calculated unadjusted cause-specific survival up to 10 years from diagnosis for 68, 495 first primary cases of melanoma diagnosed from 1992 to 2005. Cox multivariate analysis was performed for 5 -year survival. Data from 1992 to 2001 were divided into 3 time periods to compare stage distribution and differences in stage-specific 5 -year survival over time. ResultsMelanomas that had metastasized (distant stage) or were thicker than 4. 00 mm had a poor prognosis (5 -year survival: 15. 7 % and 56. 6 %). The 5 -year survival for men was 86. 8 % and for persons given the diagnosis at age 65 years or older was 83. 2 %, varying by stage at diagnosis. Scalp/neck melanoma had lower 5 -year survival (82. 6 %) than other anatomic sites; unspecified/overlapping lesions had the least favorable prognosis (41. 5 %). Nodular and <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> <b>melanomas</b> had the poorest 5 -year survival among histologic subtypes (69. 4 % and 81. 2 %, respectively). Survival differences by race/ethnicity were observed in the unadjusted survival, but nonsignificant in the multivariate analysis. Overall 5 -year melanoma survival increased from 87. 7 % to 90. 1 % for melanomas diagnosed in 1992 through 1995 compared with 1999 through 2001, and this change was not clearly associated with a shift toward localized diagnosis. LimitationsPrognostic factors included in revised melanoma staging guidelines were not available for all study years and were not examined. ConclusionsPoorer survival from melanoma was observed among those given the diagnosis at late stage and older age. Improvements in survival over time have been minimal. Although newly available therapies may impact survival, prevention and early detection are relevant to melanoma-specific survival.

40|$|BACKGROUND: 					 The {{incidence}} of melanoma {{has been steadily}} rising in past decades. Although it accounts for only 3 % of all skin cancers, it is responsible for 75 % of deaths. 				 				 					OBJECTIVE: 					 to describe the epidemiological aspects of melanoma in a university hospital setting {{over a period of}} 20 years. 				 				 					METHODS: 					 A total of 166 patients were analyzed between January 1990 and January 2010 for clinical and histological variables and correlations between them. A 5 % level of significance was adopted. 				 				 					RESULTS: 					 The majority of patients were Caucasians (74 %), females (61 %), with a mean age at diagnosis of 55. The predominant histological type was lentigo maligna/lentigo maligna melanoma (35. 7 %) and the head and neck was the most affected site (30. 7 %). Among non-Caucasians, the acral region was the most affected. Most tumors were in situ (41. 1 %). Growth of the lesion was the most frequent complaint (58. 1 %) and bleeding was most frequently associated with melanomas with a depth > 4 mm. There were seven deaths (4. 2 %), with a high risk among men, non-Caucasians and those under 20 years of age, with a Breslow's depth > 2 mm, with <b>lentiginous</b> <b>acral</b> <b>melanoma</b> and with a history of growth and bleeding.

40|$|Approximately 90 % of melanomas {{arise from}} skin sites (known as {{cutaneous}} malignant melanoma; CMM), whereas the non-cutaneous melanoma (mucosal and ocular melanomas) are rare, accounting for about 10 %. Familial melanoma accounts {{for up to}} 10 % of patients diagnosed with CMM. Both genetics (e. g. CDKN 2 A and CDK 4 germline mutations, as well as polymorphisms in MC 1 R and other genes) and environmental factors (ultraviolet radiation) contribute to the induction of melanoma. The MAPK and the PI 3 K {{are the two most}} commonly activated signaling cascades in melanomas. Activation of these two pathways occurs frequently through alterations in BRAF, NRAS and KIT oncogenes. The involvement of these oncogenes in common CMM subtypes is well-studied. However, the frequency of mutations in BRAF, NRAS and KIT and also PTEN has not been well-characterized in the other rare melanoma subtypes, at least not in Caucasian populations. The overall aim of this thesis was to better define the molecular genetic alterations of BRAF, NRAS and KIT in different subtypes of melanomas and to correlate the mutation status with the histopathological features of the tumors and with the clinical parameters of the patients. For the first project, Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples of primary familial and sporadic CMMs were collected from eight centers in Europe and Australia. The overall aim was to better define the frequencies of BRAF and NRAS mutations in familial melanoma with and without germline CDKN 2 A mutations. Overall, 89 tumors from patients with germline CDKN 2 A mutations, 46 from patients without germline CDKN 2 A mutations, and 50 sporadic melanomas were analyzed for BRAF exon 15 and NRAS (exon 2) mutations using direct DNA sequencing. The tumors were also evaluated for pERK and pAkt expression by immunohistochemistry. The BRAF and NRAS mutation frequencies detected in familial melanomas were 43 % and 11 %, respectively. These frequencies did not differ significantly between tumors from germline CDKN 2 A mutation carriers and non-carriers. The frequency of BRAF mutation (41 %) and NRAS mutation (12 %) in the sporadic melanomas did not differ significantly from that identified in the familial melanomas. Expression of pERK and pAkt was observed in 65 % and 46 % of the familial melanomas, respectively. Similar frequencies of pERK and pAkt expressions were observed in the sporadic melanomas. In the second project, we analyzed a large number of a rare subtype of melanoma; sinonasal mucosal melanoma. In total, 56 primary tumors were screened for mutations in KIT (exons 11, 13 and 17), NRAS (exons 1 and 2) and BRAF exon 15 using direct sequencing. Twelve of the 56 (21 %) tumors contained one mutation in these oncogenes; 2 tumors harbored KIT mutations, another 2 harbored BRAF mutations and 8 had NRAS mutations. The mutations were more frequently detected in tumors originated from the paranasal sinuses than from the nasal cavity (p= 0. 045). Patients with melanoma in the paranasal sinuses had a worse overall survival than patients with melanoma in the nasal cavity (p= 0. 027). In the third project, primary and metastatic <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> <b>melanomas</b> were investigated for mutations in BRAF (exons 11 and 15), NRAS (exons 1 and 2), KIT (exons 9, 11, 13, 17 and 18) and PTEN (exons 1, 3 - 6 and 10 - 12) by direct sequencing. The data showed an identical mutation frequency of 15 % (13 out of 88) of both KIT and NRAS, whereas BRAF mutations were found in 17 % (15 out of 88) of the primary tumors. Of the 25 cases evaluated for PTEN mutations, only one tumor contained a mutation (4 %). The BRAF, NRAS and KIT mutation status in 16 metastases was similar to that identified in the matched primaries. In comparison with BRAF wild-type tumors, BRAF mutated tumors were more commonly diagnosed in young individuals (p= 0. 028) and significantly associated with tumor location on the feet (p= 0. 039) and female gender (p= 0. 039). The anatomical site was an independent prognostic factor with better overall survival for patients with tumors on hand or subungual areas than those with tumors on the feet or under toenails (p= 0. 025). In the fourth project, we evaluated 124 primary and 76 metastatic (73 were matched metastases) CMMs for BRAFV 600 E expression by immunohistochemistry using VE 1 antibody. Overall, 55 % (110 out of 200) tumors displayed a positive homogenous staining. There was a consistency in BRAFV 600 E staining between the matched primaries and metastatic CMMs. In 28 tumors a discrepancy was observed between the VE 1 staining and the mutation analysis methods. Re-analysis of 25 tumors of the discrepant cases by pyrosequencing revealed a new BRAFV 600 E mutation in three cases, supporting the results seen with VE 1 staining. In the remaining 22 tumors the results of the pyrosequencing and the initial mutation methods were similar. Overall sensitivity and specificity with VE 1 antibody staining were 97 % and 80 %, respectively...|$|R
30|$|Images of {{four types}} of <b>melanoma</b> (<b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous,</b> lentigo maligna, nodular, {{superficial}} spreading) and {{four types of}} benign pigmented lesion (blue nevi, lentigo, melanocytic nevi, seborrheic keratoses) {{were used in the}} current study. Images of skin lesion were collected via Google image search by using the name of the lesion type (e.g. lentigo maligna) as the key words. The accuracy of the diagnosis of all the images were then validated by an expert dermatologist. This validation procedure excluded 11 images from the study, either because of the uncertainty of the diagnosis from visual inspection of the images alone or the existence of more than one type of melanoma lesion in the same image (e.g. lentigo maligna with a nodular component). The remaining 237 images (120 melanoma, 117 benign) were scaled to fit within a frame of 300 × 300 pixels and cropped to remove any body part information.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Cutaneous foot {{melanoma}} is rare, {{challenging to}} manage, and not adequately {{examined in the}} literature. This study evaluated the prognostic variables and surgical management of foot melanoma. Materials and Methods. Foot melanoma cases managed at an academic center from 1985 to 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Results. 46 patients were identified with {{a broad range of}} demographic characteristics. Overall recurrence was 32. 6 %: 19 % <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous,</b> 57 % nodular, 66 % superficial spreading, 30 % melanoma unspecified, 50 % severely atypical; 53 % ulcerated, 23 % nonulcerated; 29 % on the dorsum of the foot, 17 % heel, 60 % ankle, 22 % toe, 50 % plantar; 0 %[*] 4 [*]mm. 13 had positive nodes, 4 (31 %) of whom recurred. Prognostic factors and recurrence did not correlate, and survival was 96 % with a median followup of 91 months. Conclusions. Aggressive management of foot melanoma may result in excellent long-term survival even following disease recurrence...|$|R
40|$|<b>Acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> <b>{{melanoma}}</b> (ALM) is {{the most}} common type of melanoma in dark skinned peoples and Asians. The mean age of ALM ranges from 55 to 68 years. We report a case of ALM in a 60 -year-old male patient presented with growth over palmer surface of left thumb since 2 years. The prognosis of invasive acral melanoma is poor, but future studies are needed to know more about the clinical outcome of this malignancy...|$|E
40|$|Interdigital spaces {{could be}} an area of affection of a various {{cutaneous}} conditions, most of them with benign origin. The spectrum of differential diagnosis of pigmented interdigital lesions with a recent occurrence is not so wide, in contrast. When considering pigmented lesions in the interdigital area, the most harmless differential diagnosis is a traumatic hematoma. But {{what would happen if}} we based our therapeutic behaviour or suspicious and unconfirmed harmless diagnosis, instead of considering the real life-threatening once with priority, if we kept in mind that <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> <b>melanoma</b> has rather an aggressive course and is the main cause of death in skin cancer patients? We present a case of misdiagnosed interdigital melanoma, treated as a hemangioma with curettage, with almost fatal consequences, in regard to uncontrolled tumor progression {{as a result of the}} wrong traumatic procedure in one hand, and the lack of adequate screening and follow up, leading to progress of the disease with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis in general. We want to emphasise the importance of <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> <b>melanoma</b> with an unusual location in the differential diagnostic plan because, despite the early detection, early eradication with simple excision could save a life, or at least could provide a better prognosis...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> <b>melanoma</b> on the plantar aspect of foot in a 50 -year-old male that {{exhibited}} a prominent osteo-cartilaginous differentiation in the metastatic inguinal lymph node. The ability of melanomas to undergo multidirectional differentiation leads {{to a variety of}} histological appearances that can be misleading. Although {{the true nature of the}} tumor is most often recognized at the primary cutaneous site, metastatic tumors may closely mimic other malignant mesenchymal or neuro-ectodermal tumors. Hence awareness of this unusual phenomenon occurring in malignant melanoma is essential to avoid misdiagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Vulvar {{malignancies}} {{are important}} {{tumors of the}} female reproductive system. They represent a serious health issue with an incidence between 2 and 7 per 100, 000 and year. We provide a review about most important cancer entities, i. e., melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine cancer, and skin adnexal malignancies. Squamous cell carcinoma {{is the most common}} vulvar malignancy that can develop from vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia or de novo. Basal cell carcinoma represents only 2 [*]% of all vulvar cancers. Melanoma of the vulva exists in two major types-superficial spreading and <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous.</b> A special feature is the occurrence of multiple vulvar melanomas. Of the adnexal cancer types Paget's disease and carcinoma are seen more frequently than other adnexal malignancies. The dermatologist should be aware of this problem, since he might be the first to be consulted by patients for vulvar disease. Treatment should be interdisciplinary in close association to gynecologists, oncologists, and radiologists...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{phospholipase}} D plays a crucial part in the signal transduction of many types of cells, and is activated by protein kinase C a when cells are sti-mulated. To elucidate the role of phospholipase D in melanoma, the expression of phospholipase D 1 and pro-tein kinase C a in primary and metastatic lesions of ac-ral <b>lentiginous</b> <b>melanoma</b> and super¢cial spreading melanoma was investigated using immunohistologic techniques. In addition, the mechanism of regulation of phospholipase D 1 by protein kinase C a was exam-ined in a human melanoma cell line HM 3 KO using an adenovirus-mediated gene transfer technique. Both phospholipase D 1 and protein kinase C a were strongly expressed in primary and metastatic lesions of super¢-cial spreading melanoma. Conversely, in acral lentigi...|$|R
40|$|In the 19 -year {{period from}} 1964 to 1982, {{a total of}} 65 primary melanomas at all sites were recorded. Of the 43 primary {{cutaneous}} melanomas in Chinese patients, 32 (74 %) occurred at volar or subungual sites. The foot contributed 56 % of all cutaneous melanomas with the majority (83 %) occurring on the plantar surface. Subungual melanomas, with one exception, presented in the nailbed of the great toe or thumb. The following is the distribution of volar or subungual melanomas by histologic type: <b>acral</b> <b>lentiginous</b> 51. 7 %, superficial spreading 20. 7 %, nodular 6. 9 %, and unclassifiable 20. 7 %. Thickness was greater than 3 mm in 81. 5 % of cases, and in 37 % it was greater than 9 mm. A prior pigmented lesion was noted in 15 of the volar or subungual cases. The Chinese, like other racial groups with intermediate pigmentation, {{appear to have a}} preponderance of melanomas on the feet with a frequency between that of whites and the very high one seen in blacks. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
