40|$|Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA) {{syndrome}} {{is a risk}} factor for mortality, cardiovascular events, hypertension and diabetes. OSA is very frequent and under-diagnosed in cardiac patient. Thus, a practical screening tool for cardiac rehabilitation (CR) patients is required. In this preliminary study, we prospectively detected patients at high risk of having OSA using both Berlin Sleep Questionnaire (BSQ) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). 171 consecutive patients entering a cardiac rehabilitation programme were screened. The BSQ and the ESS was administered simultaneously {{at the beginning of the}} programme. CR admissions were due to: coronary artery by-pass grafting (30 %), coronary angioplasty/stent (39 %), <b>angor</b> <b>pectoris</b> or myocardial infarction (6 %), aortic/mitral valve replacement (7 %), dilated cardiomyopathy (5 %), other (13 %). High risk for OSA was found in 66 patients (39 %). 50 patients were detected at high risk of having OSA with the only BSQ, 9 patients with the only ESS and 7 patients with both questionnaires. Characteristics of the high risk patients versus low risk patients were: Age (years) 58. 6 vs 56. 8, sex female(n) 20 vs 23, heart failure (n) 5 vs 12, current and previous smoking (n) 30 vs 43, hypertension (n) 46 vs 35, diabetes (n) 30 vs 33, body mass index (kg/m 2) 29. 2 vs 26, glucose (mg/dL) 115 vs 106, LDL cholesterol (mg/dL) 82 vs 83, HDl cholesterol (mg/dL) 43 vs 44, triglycerides (mg/dL) 136 vs 141. ConclusionsIn this preliminary study, screening using Berlin questionnaire and Epworth Scale identify a high prevalence of patients at high risk of having sleep apnea. Screening must be encouraged in cardiac rehabilitation programme. Further investigations are nevertheless required to improve the strategy of screening with procedures that could be complex (overnight oximetry, apnea link, polygraphy) ...|$|E
40|$|Arterial {{elasticity}} is {{an early}} marker of atherosclerotic process and {{is related to the}} cardiovascular disease risk. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the effects of a 6 -week rehabilitation program on arterial compliance in patients with heart disease. 294 patients (mean age 57 +/– 11 years, 213 men, 81 women) were included. They performed a supervised aerobic training and multidisciplinary educational interventions five days per week, during 6 weeks. Reasons of admission were: coronary heart disease artery bypass graft surgery (32 %), angioplasty percutaneous coronary interventions and stent (35 %), <b>angor</b> <b>pectoris</b> or myocardial infarction (9 %), aortic or mitral valve replacement or repair (11 %), dilated cardiomyopathy (5 %), other (8 %). Large (C 1) and small artery (C 2) elasticity indices (in ml/mmHg) were measured using the HDI/PulseWaveTM CR- 2000 Research CardioVascular Profiling System (Hypertension Diagnostics TM, Inc) before and after rehabilitation. A negative correlation was found between age and artery elasticity for both C 1 and C 2. After training a + 8 % increase in C 1 (from 15. 96 to 17. 20 – p< 0. 001) and a 20 % increase in C 2 (from 4. 19 to 5. 03 – p< 0. 001) were observed in the whole population. C 1 and C 2 were significantly lower in women in comparison with men, before (respectively 14. 37 and 3. 39 in women vs 16. 56 and 4. 49 in men) and after the rehabilitation program (15. 59 and 3. 97 in women vs 17. 78 and 5. 4 in men). A similar increase in artery elasticity was found in women and men (respectively + 8 % vs + 8 % for C 1, and + 17 % vs + 20 % for C 2) after the rehabilitation program. ConclusionA 6 -week aerobic training and multidisciplinary educational program is able to improve large and small artery elasticity in patients with heart disease. This should be relevant to improve prognosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} study was to evaluate {{the effects of a}} holistic ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program on anxiety and depression in diabetic’men with coronary heart disease (CHD) Methods 275 diabetic’men with CHD (D) and 430 non diabetic’men with CHD (ND) used as control group, with identical age (57. 2 +- 9 / 54 +- 55. 5 +- 11 years respectively) were included in the study. All patients performed a 6 -week program including exercise training, psychological screening and support as well as education concerning lifestyle. Reasons of admission were: CABG surgery (45 %), angioplasty and stent (41 %), <b>angor</b> <b>pectoris</b> or myocardial infarction (14 %). Level of anxiety and depression were measured by the psychologist using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale, before and after the CR program. ResultsAt baseline, prevalence of anxiety [HAD≥ 11] was similar in D and ND (31 % vs 32 %). The prevalence of depression [HAD≥ 8] was higher in D compared with ND (31 % vs 24 %, p< 0. 05) At {{the end of the program}} of CR, the entire population studied achieved significant improvements characterised by a statistically significant fall in anxiety/depression (HAD scale). The prevalence of anxiety [HAD≥ 11] was similar in D and ND (11 % both). The prevalence of depression [HAD≥ 8] was higher but statistically insignificant in D compared with ND (10 % vs 6 %, p< 0. 08). ConclusionOur study confirms that anxiety and depression are frequent in men with CHD. The prevalence of depression is higher in diabetics compared to non diabetics. A holistic CR program including psychological screening and support is able to reduce significantly the level of anxiety and depression in both diabetics and non diabetics’men. Our results emphasize the need to a systematic screening for depression particularly in diabetics and the positive impact of the CR which should be relevant to improve prognosis, even if it is needed to be confirm...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} study was to compare the effects of an ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation program (CRP) on anxiety and depression between women and men. 893 patients, 256 women and 637 men, with identical age (56 / 55 years respectively) were included. All patients performed a 6 -week multidisciplinary holistic CRP including exercise training, psychological screening and support as well as education concerning lifestyle. Reasons of admission were: {{coronary artery bypass graft}} surgery (41 %), angioplasty & stent (25 %), <b>angor</b> <b>pectoris</b> & myocardial infarction (8 %), valve replacement (13 %), dilated cardiomyopathy (4 %), other (9 %). Level of anxiety (A) and depression (D) were measured by the psychologist using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale, before and after the CRP. At baseline, women had a significant higher score for A (11. 24 vs 9. 02, p< 0. 001) with a higher prevalence of A [HAD≥ 11] (57 % vs 34 % – p< 0. 001) compared to men. Women had also a significant higher score for D (7. 39 vs 5. 91 – p< 0. 001) with a higher prevalence of D [HAD≥ 8] (44 % vs 31 % – p< 0. 001). At the end of the program, the entire population studied achieved significant improvements characterised by a statistically significant fall in anxiety/depression. However, mean fall for A was significantly higher in women (– 36 % vs – 28 %, p< 0. 05) as compared to men. Identical trends was found for D (– 54 % vs – 41 %, p< 0. 05). Consequently, prevalence of A (18 % vs 14 % – p= 0. 059) and D (9 % vs 9 %). were similar in women and men {{at the end of the}} rehabilitation. ConclusionsIn our study, at baseline, women had a higher level of anxiety and depression compared to men. A holistic rehabilitation program including psychological screening and support is able to reduce significantly the level of anxiety and depression in both women and men. However, women achieved higher improvement. Consequently, at the end of the program, women and men had a similar prevalence for anxiety and depression...|$|E
