40|$|User Equipment (UE) paging <b>and</b> <b>location</b> {{tracking}} {{are influenced}} by the underling state handling model. There are recent proposals to introduce a new RRC state called RRC Inactive as a main state for inactive UEs in 5 th Generation (5 G) cellular systems. One of the characteristics of the new state is that the interface between the Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network (CN) is kept. Considering this characteristic, there are proposals for a RAN controlled paging <b>and</b> <b>location</b> tracking schemes for RRC Inactive UEs. In this paper, we show that this approach is not always beneficial, especially for high mobility UEs. Instead, we propose a hybrid paging <b>and</b> <b>location</b> tracking scheme where both RAN and CN are involved in the paging <b>and</b> <b>location</b> tracking of RRC Inactive UEs. This is done transparently to the UE. We further propose a hierarchical paging <b>and</b> <b>location</b> tracking scheme to reduce the signaling overhead from paging <b>and</b> <b>location</b> tracking updates. The scheme is applicable to both RAN based and CN based paging <b>and</b> <b>location</b> tracking schemes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — As {{the amount}} of Web {{information}} grows rapidly, search engines {{must be able to}} retrieve information according to the user’s preference. In this paper, we propose a new web search personalization approach that captures the user’s interests and preferences in the form of concepts by mining search results and their clickthroughs. Due to the important role location information plays in mobile search, we separate concepts into content concepts <b>and</b> <b>location</b> concepts, <b>and</b> organize them into ontologies to create an ontology-based, multi-facet (OMF) profile to precisely capture the user’s content <b>and</b> <b>location</b> interests <b>and</b> hence improve the search accuracy. Moreover, recognizing the fact that different users and queries may have different emphases on content <b>and</b> <b>location</b> information, we introduce the notion of content <b>and</b> <b>location</b> entropies to measure {{the amount of}} content <b>and</b> <b>location</b> information associated with a query, and click content <b>and</b> <b>location</b> entropies to measure how much the user is interested in the content <b>and</b> <b>location</b> information in the results. Accordingly, we propose to define personalization effectiveness based on the entropies and use it to balance the weights between the content <b>and</b> <b>location</b> facets. Finally, based on the derived ontologies and personalization effectiveness, we train an SVM to adapt a personalized ranking function for re-ranking of future search. We conduct extensive experiments to compare the precision produced by our OMF profiles and that of a baseline method. Experimental results show that OMF improves the precision significantly compared to the baseline. I...|$|R

5|$|As {{illustrated}} by the table of matches above, little is known of organised cricket to 1725 {{because of the lack}} of newspaper coverage.

Sport, including cricket, was not a subject to be reported and the few references found are in official records, such as court cases, or in private letters and diaries.

40|$|AbstractThe primate {{visual system}} is {{considered}} to be segregated into ventral and dorsal streams specialized for processing object identity <b>and</b> <b>location,</b> respectively. We reexamined the dorsal/ventral model using a stimulus-driven approach to object identity <b>and</b> <b>location</b> processing. While looking at repeated presentations of a standard object at a standard location, subjects monitored for any infrequent “oddball” changes in object identity, <b>location,</b> or identity <b>and</b> <b>location</b> (conjunction). While the identity <b>and</b> <b>location</b> oddballs preferentially activated ventral and dorsal brain regions respectively, each oddball type activated both pathways. Furthermore, all oddball types recruited the lateral temporal cortex and the temporo-parietal junction. These findings suggest that a strict dorsal/ventral dual-stream model does not fully account for the perception of novel objects in space...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between stimulus-dependent and task-dependent activations in human auditory cortex (AC) during pitch <b>and</b> <b>location</b> processing {{is not well}} understood. In the present {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} study, we investigated the processing of task-irrelevant and task-relevant pitch <b>and</b> <b>location</b> during discrimination, n-back, and visual tasks. We tested three hypotheses: (1) According to prevailing auditory models, stimulus-dependent processing of pitch <b>and</b> <b>location</b> should be associated with enhanced activations in distinct areas of the anterior and posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG), respectively. (2) Based on our previous studies, task-dependent activation patterns during discrimination and n-back tasks should be similar when these tasks are performed on sounds varying in pitch or location. (3) Previous studies in humans and animals suggest that pitch <b>and</b> <b>location</b> tasks should enhance activations especially in those areas that also show activation enhancements associated with stimulus-dependent pitch <b>and</b> <b>location</b> processing, respectively. Consistent with our hypotheses, we found stimulus dependent sensitivity to pitch <b>and</b> <b>location</b> in anterolateral STG and anterior planum temporale (PT), respectively, in line with the view that these features are processed in separate parallel pathways. Further, task-dependent activations during discrimination and n-back tasks were associated with enhanced activations in anterior/posterior STG and posterior STG/inferior parietal lobule (IPL) irrespective of stimulus features. However, direct comparisons between pitch <b>and</b> <b>location</b> tasks performed on identical sounds revealed no significant activation differences. These results suggest that activations during pitch <b>and</b> <b>location</b> tasks are not strongly affected by enhanced stimulus dependent activations to pitch or location. We also found that activations in PT were strongly modulated by task requirements and that areas in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) showed task-dependent activation modulations, but no systematic activations to pitch or location. Based on these results, we argue that activations during pitch <b>and</b> <b>location</b> tasks cannot be explained by enhanced stimulus specific processing alone, but rather that activations in human AC depend in a complex manner on the requirements of the task at hand...|$|R
