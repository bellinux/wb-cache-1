5|$|Another type of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>water</b> {{collector}} {{makes use}} of desiccants which adsorb <b>atmospheric</b> <b>water</b> at ambient temperature, this {{makes it possible to}} extract moisture even when the relative humidity is as low as 14 percent. Systems of this sort have proved to be very useful as emergency supplies of safe drinking water. For regeneration, the desiccant needs to be heated. In some designs regeneration energy is supplied by the sun; air is ventilated at night over a bed of desiccants that adsorb the water vapour. During the day, the premises are closed, the greenhouse effect increases the temperature, and, as in solar desalination pools, the water vapour is partially desorbed, condenses on a cold part and is collected.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA quasi-on-line {{method of}} {{measurement}} of the oxidation states of iron coupled with a GFAAS analysis is reported for the trace conditions found in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>waters.</b> This technique {{is based on the}} formation of a specific complex [Fe(FZ) 3](4 -) between Fe(II) and ferrozine (FZ). tC(18) solid-phase extraction cartridges (Sep-Pak) are used to separate the [Fe(FZ) 3](4 -) and Fe(III) so as to limit the risk of redox evolution of the sample. The adaptation to dilute aqueous media, via acidification at pH 2 of rainwater sample, and atmospheric interferences are discussed, and the Fe(II) recovery in rainwaters is determined. This method coupled with a quasi-on-line sampling protocol has been tested on rains collected in Guadeloupe Island (Caribbean Sea, 16 degrees N, 61 degrees W) during a field campaign in May 2005. Our results show that the proposed method can satisfactorily be applied to the determination of Fe(II) and Fe(III) in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>waters</b> under in situ conditions...|$|R

40|$|Aqueous {{chemistry}} in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>waters</b> (e. g., cloud droplets or wet aerosols) {{is considered}} a potentially important atmospheric pathway to produce secondary organic aerosol (SOA aq). Water-soluble organic compounds with small carbon numbers (C 2 –C 3) are precursors for SOA aq; products include organic acids, organic sulfates, and high-molecular-weight compounds/oligomers. Fenton reactions and the uptake of gas-phase OH radicals {{are considered to be}} the major oxidant sources for aqueous organic chemistry. However, the sources and availability of oxidants in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>waters</b> are not well understood. The degree to which OH is produced in the aqueous phase affects the balance of radical and non-radical aqueous chemistry, the properties of the resulting aerosol, and likely its atmospheric behavior. This paper demonstrates organic peroxide formation during aqueous photooxidation of methylglyoxal using ultra-high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). Organic peroxides are known to form through gas-phase oxidation of volatile organic compounds. They contribute secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation directly by forming peroxyhemiacetals and epoxides (i. e., IEPOX), and indirectly by enhancing gas-phase oxidation through OH recycling. We provide simulation results of organic peroxide/peroxyhemiacetal formation in clouds and wet aerosols and discuss organic peroxides as a source of condensed-phase OH radicals and as a contributor to aqueous SOA...|$|R

25|$|After a cloud, for instance, {{has started}} {{its way to}} {{becoming}} a lightning generator, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>water</b> vapor acts as a substance (or insulator) that decreases the ability of the cloud to discharge its electrical energy. Over a certain amount of time, if the cloud continues to generate and store more static electricity, the barrier that was created by the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>water</b> vapor will ultimately break down from the stored electrical potential energy. This energy will be released to a locally, oppositely charged region in the form of lightning.

40|$|Photochemical redox cycling of iron {{coupled with}} {{oxidation}} of malonate (Mal) ligand {{has been investigated}} under conditions that are representative of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>waters.</b> Malonate exhibited significantly different characteristics from oxalate and other dicarboxylates (or monocarboxylates). Both strong chelating ability with Fe(III) and strong molar absorptivities, but much low efficiency of Fe(II) formation (ΦFe(II) = 0. 0022 ± 0. 0009, 300 − 366 nm) were observed for Fe(III) −Mal complexes (FMCs). Fe(III) speciation calculation indicated that Mal is capable of mediating the proportion between two photoactive species of Fe(III) −OH complexes and FMCs by changing the Mal concentration. Spin-trapping electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments proved the formation of both the ·CH 2 COOH and ·OH radicals at lower total Mal concentration ([Mal]T), but only ·CH 2 COOH at higher concentrations of malonate, providing strong evidence for competition between malonate and OH− and subsequent different photoreaction pathways. Once FMCs dominate the Fe(III) speciation, both photoproduction and photocatalyzed oxidation of Fe(II) will be greatly decelerated. There exists an induction period for both formation and decay of Fe(II) until FeIII(OH) 2 + species become the prevailing Fe(III) forms over FMCs as Mal ligand is depleted. A quenching mechanism of Mal in the Fe(II) photoproduction is proposed. The present study is meaningful to advance our understanding of iron cycling in acidified carbon-rich <b>atmospheric</b> <b>waters...</b>|$|R

Low-level liquid clouds have the most significant influence on cloud radiative forcing due to their areal extent and frequency.
