5|$|The Greek poet Stasinos {{mentioned}} {{them in the}} Cypria {{amongst the}} flowers of Cyprus. The legend of Persephone comes to us mainly {{in the seventh century}} BC Homeric Hymn To Demeter, where the author describes the narcissus, and its role as <b>a</b> <b>lure</b> to trap the young Persephone. The flower, she recounts to her mother was the last flower she reached for before being seized.|$|E
5|$|Cucurbitacin is a plant steroid {{present in}} wild Cucurbita {{and in each}} member of the family Cucurbitaceae. Poisonous to mammals, it is found in {{quantities}} sufficient to discourage herbivores. It makes wild Cucurbita and most ornamental gourds, with the exception of an occasional C.fraterna and C.sororia, bitter to taste. Ingesting too much cucurbitacin can cause stomach cramps, diarrhea and even collapse. This bitterness is especially prevalent in wild Cucurbita; in parts of Mexico the flesh of the fruits is rubbed on a woman's breast to wean children. While the process of domestication has largely removed the bitterness from cultivated varieties, there are occasional reports of cucurbitacin causing illness in humans. Cucurbitacin is also used as <b>a</b> <b>lure</b> in insect traps.|$|E
5|$|Set {{apart from}} the glowing underside, the darker, nonluminescent collar tapers at {{both sides of the}} throat, and has been {{hypothesized}} to serve as <b>a</b> <b>lure</b> by mimicking the silhouette of a small fish from below. The appeal of the lure would be multiplied in a school of sharks. If the collar does function in this way, the cookiecutter shark would be the only known case of bioluminescence in which the absence of light attracts prey, while its photophores serve to prevent premature detection by incoming would-be predators. As the shark can only match a limited range of light intensities, its vertical movements likely serve to preserve the effectiveness of its disguise across various times of day and weather conditions.|$|E

5|$|With {{the added}} missile {{capacity}} of the battleships in the 1980s came additional fire-support systems to launch and guide the ordnance. To fire the Harpoon anti-ship missiles, the battleships were equipped with the SWG-1 fire-control system, and to fire the Tomahawk missiles the battleships used either the SWG-2 or SWG-3 fire-control system. In addition to these offensive-weapon systems, the battleships were outfitted with the AN/SLQ-25 Nixie {{to be used as}} <b>a</b> <b>lure</b> against enemy torpedoes, an SLQ-32 electronic warfare system that can detect, jam, and deceive an opponent's radar and a Mark 36 SRBOC system to fire chaff rockets intended to confuse enemy missiles.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of Casino Royale, Fleming used his annual holiday at his house in Jamaica to write another Bond story. Twelve Bond novels and two short-story collections were published between 1953 and 1966, the last two (The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights) posthumously. Much of the background to the stories came from Fleming's previous work in the Naval Intelligence Division or from events he knew of from the Cold War. The plot of From Russia, with Love uses a fictional Soviet Spektor decoding machine as <b>a</b> <b>lure</b> to trap Bond; the Spektor had {{its roots in the}} wartime German Enigma machine. The novel's plot device of spies on the Orient Express was based on the story of Eugene Karp, a US naval attaché and intelligence agent based in Budapest who took the Orient Express from Budapest to Paris in February 1950, carrying papers about blown US spy networks in the Eastern Bloc. Soviet assassins already on the train drugged the conductor, and Karp's body was found shortly afterwards in a railway tunnel south of Salzburg.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill, Daniel, and Teal'c try {{to obtain}} {{intelligence}} {{on the little}} self-replicating robotic invaders in the submarine, but {{they are forced to}} fall back. With Daniel's new theory that the Replicators are made up of the same materials they consume, the Replicators may be eliminated through sinking the iron submarine as long as the surviving Replicator from Thor's advanced ship is destroyed beforehand. Meanwhile, Carter witnesses a short battle against the Replicators in the Asgard galaxy during which five Asgard ships are lost. Carter notices the Replicators' attraction to new technology and proposes to use the O'Neill, an incomplete Asgard ship originally designed to fight the Replicators, as <b>a</b> <b>lure</b> to draw the Replicators into hyperspace and destroy them in the O'Neills self-destruct. Thor eventually accepts the plan, the Replicators take the bait and are destroyed.|$|E

5|$|P. schultzi {{does not}} respond to prey if the light is under 100lux (like a {{restaurant}} with only subdued artificial lighting), but responds to prey at distances from 6 to 10centimetres as the light level increases. A test suggested that P. schultzi′s hunting is stimulated only by vision, as prey close but hidden caused no response. A preliminary check showed that lures got the same responses from P. schultzi as live prey, and then more detailed testing with the lures showed that: if the target moved erratically, P. schultzi did not pursue it; if the target was totally stationary, the spider approached very slow (between 5 and 100millimetres per minute), with very long pauses in the final stages, and the sequence was not completed in 43% of cases; if the lure jiggled on the same spot, P. schultzi approached much faster and the sequence was almost always completed; if <b>a</b> <b>lure</b> was pulled directly away from P. schultzi, the spider followed, and faster if the lure was pulled, up to a limit (P. schultzi generally moves very slowly).|$|E

25|$|Schutzhund is a dog sport, {{developed}} in Germany, that tests dogs on police tasks including odor detection and search and rescue. Flirt pole work {{is often used}} in training to teach skills that the dog will need later in protection work, in particular, targeting skills and grip. A flattened plastic bottle as <b>a</b> <b>lure</b> is hard to grip and teaches the dog to bite hard and hang on.|$|E
25|$|Siphonophorae is {{an order}} of marine animals from the phylum Hydrozoa that consist of a {{specialized}} medusoid and polyp zooid. Some siphonophores, including the genus Erenna {{that live in the}} aphotic zone between depths of 1600 m and 2300 m, exhibit yellow to red fluorescence in the photophores of their tentacle-like tentilla. This fluorescence occurs as a by-product of bioluminescence from these same photophores. The siphonophores exhibit the fluorescence in a flicking pattern that is used as <b>a</b> <b>lure</b> to attract prey.|$|E

25|$|Tool use by American {{alligators}} and mugger crocodiles {{has been}} documented. During the breeding season, birds such as herons and egrets look for sticks {{to build their}} nests. Alligators and crocodiles collect sticks to use as bait to catch birds. The crocodilian positions itself near a rookery, partially submerges with the sticks balanced on its head, and when a bird approaches to take the stick, it springs its trap. This stick displaying strategy is the first known case of a predator not only using an object as <b>a</b> <b>lure,</b> but also {{taking into account the}} seasonal behavior of its prey.|$|E
25|$|However, after a {{successful}} rehabilitation, the next opportunity for Hadlee {{to claim the}} test wicket world record was against India in India in 1988. After touring India in 1976 Hadlee, plagued by stomach troubles, had decided never to play cricket there again, however {{the opportunity to make}} history was too strong <b>a</b> <b>lure</b> to pass up. He duly captured the record, and his 374th test wicket, in the first test of the series. In the second test a 10 wicket haul helped New Zealand to a rare test win in India, although the series was eventually lost 2–1.|$|E
25|$|In 1560, Basque conquistadors Pedro de Ursúa and Lope de Aguirre journeyed {{down the}} Marañón and Amazon Rivers, {{in search of}} El Dorado, with 300 Spaniards and {{hundreds}} of natives; the actual goal of Ursúa was to send idle veterans from the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire away, {{to keep them from}} trouble-making, using the El Dorado myth as <b>a</b> <b>lure.</b> A year later, Aguirre participated in the overthrow and killing of Ursúa and his successor, Fernando de Guzmán, whom he ultimately succeeded. He and his men reached the Atlantic (probably by the Orinoco River), destroying native villages on the way.|$|E

25|$|The Virginia state {{government}} had refused President Abraham Lincoln’s appeal for troops {{to put down}} the rebellion of the southern states, and its decision to secede from the Union was ratified by popular vote on May 23, 1861. Confederate Col. (later Maj. Gen.) John B. Magruder was sent down the peninsula to deter any advance on the state capital Richmond by Union troops based at the well-defended post of Fort Monroe. This garrison was commanded by Maj Gen. Benjamin Butler, a former Massachusetts lawyer and politician, who established a new camp at nearby Hampton and another at Newport News. Magruder had also established two camps, within range of the Union lines, at Big Bethel and Little Bethel, as <b>a</b> <b>lure</b> to draw his opponent into a premature action.|$|E
25|$|A. ocellaris are {{reliant on}} sea anemone for shelter (they have a {{symbiotic}} relationship with the sea anemone). Sea anemone are protection for the fish and their nests. This is because when A. ocellaris are in the open waters, they have {{a higher risk of}} predation. It is postulated that the fanning behavior of the fish and removal of parasites promotes the health of sea anemones which contain A. ocellaris fish. In addition, the anemone provides protection for the fish with its tentacles, however, the fish’s mucus protection prevents it from being stung by the tentacles. The presence of the clownfish can be interpreted as <b>a</b> <b>lure</b> to attract potential anemone's preys close to the tentacles. And the clownfish can also defend the anemone against some reef fishes which could eat the tentacles.|$|E
25|$|Coastal environments {{during the}} Last Glacial Maximum were complex. The lowered sea level, and an {{isostatic}} bulge equilibrated with the depression beneath the Cordilleran Ice Sheet, exposed the continental shelf {{to form a}} coastal plain. While much of the coastal plain was covered with piedmont glaciers, unglaciated refugia supporting terrestrial mammals have been identified on Haida Gwaii, Prince of Wales Island, and outer islands of the Alexander Archipelago. The now-submerged coastal plain has potential for more refugia. Pollen data indicate mostly herb/shrub tundra vegetation in unglaciated areas, with some boreal forest towards {{the southern end of}} the range of Cordilleran ice. The coastal marine environment remained productive, as indicated by fossils of pinnipeds. The highly productive kelp forests over rocky marine shallows may have been <b>a</b> <b>lure</b> for coastal migration. Reconstruction of the southern Beringian coastline also suggests potential for a highly productive coastal marine environment.|$|E
