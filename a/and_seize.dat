5|$|Operation Epsom, {{also known}} as the First Battle of the Odon, was a British Second World War {{offensive}} that took place between 26 and 30 June 1944, during the Battle of Normandy. The offensive was intended to outflank <b>and</b> <b>seize</b> the German-occupied city of Caen, an important Allied objective, {{in the early stages of}} Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of north-west Europe.|$|E
5|$|The Vandals {{were also}} {{weakened}} by the hostility of their Roman subjects, the continued existence among the Vandals of a faction loyal to Hilderic, and by the ambivalent position of the Moorish tribes, who watched the oncoming conflict from the sidelines, ready to join the victor <b>and</b> <b>seize</b> the spoils.|$|E

5|$|Complying with Eighth Army's {{order for}} a spoiling attack against the North Koreans {{northwest}} of Taegu, Gay ordered the 7th Cavalry to attack on September 2 <b>and</b> <b>seize</b> Hill 518. Situated north of the lateral Waegwan-Tabu–dong road, and about midway between the two towns, it was a critical terrain feature dominating the road between the two places. After securing Hill 518, the 7th Cavalry attack was to continue on to Hill 314. Air strikes and artillery preparations were to precede the infantry attack.|$|E
5|$|Concurrently {{with the}} War of Knives, the United States and France {{were engaged in}} a bout of limited naval warfare in the Caribbean as part of the Quasi-War. In late December 1799 the American armed {{schooner}} Experiment was escorting under convoy the brig Daniel and Mary and the schooners Sea Flower, Mary, and Washington to prevent their capture by French privateers. On 1 January 1800, the convoy was caught in a dead calm off {{the north side of the}} present-day Haitian island of Gonâve, in the Bight of Leogane. Seeing the convoy becalmed, Rigaud sent eleven armed barges out to attack <b>and</b> <b>seize</b> the American vessels.|$|E
5|$|Dumouriez {{believed}} that Coburg would put his main strength {{on the right}} wing to protect the Austrian line of communications. Therefore, he planned to throw his heaviest blow against Coburg's left wing. Clerfayt's line stretched from Neerwinden, across Mittelwinden hill to Oberwinden village on the left. Dumouriez directed Valence to outflank Oberwinden with one column, attack Oberwinden frontally with the second <b>and</b> <b>seize</b> the Mittelwinden hill with the third. On Valence's left, Chartres was ordered to attack Neerwinden with his columns. At 7:00 AM, the French swarmed across the Little Gete but Valence was unable to capture the Mittelwinden hill until noon. The French seized Racour, Oberwinden and finally Neerwinden.|$|E

5|$|North Korean {{artillery}} during September 7 shelled batteries of the 9th and 99th Field Artillery Battalions, forcing {{displacement of}} two batteries during the day. US air strikes and artillery kept both Hills 902 and 570 under heavy attack. Even though the 1st Cavalry Division fell back nearly everywhere that day, Walker ordered {{it and the}} ROK II Corps to attack <b>and</b> <b>seize</b> Hill 902 and Ka-san. He directed the ROK 1st Division and the US 1st Cavalry Division to select a boundary between them and to maintain physical contact during the attack.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June 1941, contravening the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, 5.5 million Axis troops {{attacked}} the Soviet Union. In addition to Hitler's stated purpose of acquiring Lebensraum, this large-scale offensive (codenamed Operation Barbarossa) {{was intended to}} destroy the Soviet Union <b>and</b> <b>seize</b> its natural resources for subsequent aggression against the Western powers. The reaction among Germans was one of surprise and trepidation as many were concerned about how much longer the war would drag on or suspected that Germany could not win a war fought on two fronts.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, General Walter M. Robertson, {{commander}} of the battle-hardened 2nd Infantry Division, was ordered to attack <b>and</b> <b>seize</b> the Roer River dams. In case he had to pull back, he chose Elsenborn Ridge as his defensive line. General Walter E. Lauer, commanding the 99th Infantry Division, was charged with building up the defenses around Elsenborn Ridge. Lauer knew his front was extremely long and very thinly manned; he gave instructions to his division's soldiers to dig in and build cover for their foxholes.|$|E

5|$|On {{arrival in}} England, Baker {{declined}} re-enlistment into the British Marines {{and returned to}} civilian life. Within six months he received an appointment from the Navy Board to act as civilian superintendent of convicts aboard the transport vessel Surprize, which departed for New South Wales in early 1794. A British loyalist, Baker took an immediate dislike to four of the convicts under his watch, sentenced for political offences and collectively known as Scottish Martyrs. Late in the voyage he advised Surprizes captain Patrick Campbell that the Martyrs planned to mutiny <b>and</b> <b>seize</b> the vessel. Acting on Baker's word, Campbell had {{three of the four}} confined until Surprize reached Sydney Cove.|$|E
5|$|Operation Biting, {{also known}} as the Bruneval Raid, was the codename for a raid by Combined Operations in 1942. Their {{objective}} was a German Würzburg radar installation at Bruneval in France. Due to the extensive coastal defences erected by the Germans to protect the array, it was thought a commando raid from the sea would incur heavy losses, and give the garrison sufficient time for the radar equipment to be destroyed. It was therefore decided that an airborne assault followed by sea-borne evacuation would be the ideal way to surprise the garrison <b>and</b> <b>seize</b> the technology intact.|$|E
5|$|To {{counteract}} the French deployment to the region, a small British force was organised by Vice-Admiral Albemarle Bertie at Cape Town {{under the command}} of Commodore Josias Rowley, with orders to blockade Isle de France and Île Bonaparte <b>and</b> <b>seize</b> or destroy any French ships that operated from the islands. To perform this task, Rowley was given the old ship of the line HMS Raisonnable, the fourth rate HMS Leopard, frigates HMS Nereide, HMS Sirius and HMS Boadicea and a number of smaller ships. Both the British and the French squadrons reached the Indian Ocean in the spring of 1809.|$|E

5|$|Aerial {{dispersion}} {{is important}} in this species, despite its restricted distribution. Queens never forage outside or leave the nest, unless under severe deprivation. Before nuptial flight, fully developed females start to occur during summer. Between 9 and 10 pm in January, queens and males start to emerge from their host nest and begin to mate. Observations show that the alates will climb up onto objects such as lighted fluorescent lamps and begin to fly {{after half an hour}} of endless running. When queens are looking for a host nest or wandering openly, M. vindex foragers may identify a queen <b>and</b> <b>seize</b> her; such behaviour suggests that workers actively recruit fertilised queens for their nest. Host colonies tend to be smaller and depauperated when compared to other colonies without any inquiline queens, but host colonies can still produce alate offspring.|$|E
5|$|Anglo-Norman warfare was characterised by attritional {{military}} campaigns, {{in which}} commanders tried to raid enemy lands <b>and</b> <b>seize</b> castles {{in order to}} allow them to take control of their adversaries' territory, ultimately winning slow but strategic victories. Pitched battles were occasionally fought between armies but these were considered risky engagements and usually avoided by prudent commanders. The armies of the period comprised bodies of mounted, armoured knights, supported by infantry. Crossbowmen become more numerous in the 12th century, alongside the older shortbow. At the heart of these armies was the familia regis, the permanent military household of the king, which was supported in war by feudal levies, drawn up by local nobles for a limited period of service during a campaign. Mercenaries were increasingly employed, driving up the cost of warfare considerably, and adequate supplies of ready cash became essential for the success of campaigns.|$|E

5|$|At 4:00p.m., two {{anti-tank}} teams {{joined the}} Sa'iqa {{company on the}} firing ramp. Both teams, along with the company, were ordered to advance eastward <b>and</b> <b>seize</b> the crossroads. At around 5:00p.m., the Israeli Air Force began attacking Egyptian forces in the fort and {{on the west bank}} of the canal. One group of four aircraft attempted to bomb the fort; the first aircraft dropped its payload of seven bombs, then descended to a low altitude to escape anti-aircraft fire. An anti-air platoon at the Kilometer 17 mark soon shot down an Israeli aircraft (either a Mirage III or an A-4 Skyhawk) with a Strela 2 missile, destroying it. Between 6:00 and 7:00p.m. all bunkers and troop shelters inside the fort were cleared, and the Egyptians transferred 26 Israeli prisoners to {{the west bank of the}} canal, and thereafter transferred them to Port Said for intelligence gathering. The Israelis concentrated heavy artillery fire against the fort, once they were sure it had been captured by the Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|By February 1864, Admiral Bonard had {{accumulated}} sufficient reinforcements to attack <b>and</b> <b>seize</b> Định's main strongholds in the Tan Hoa and Gò Công areas. He inflicted heavy casualties on the partisans and {{forced them to}} retreat in disarray. Định reorganised his troops and procured more firearms from the local Chinese in order to resume his guerrilla campaign. He attempted to widen his support base by distributing leaflets {{as far as the}} regional centres of Saigon and Mỹ Tho, calling on nghĩa quân from other provinces to join the common struggle. By this time, the French were able to keep Định and the other resistance leaders constantly on the move, aided by a growing network of local informants. In 1863, a famine had broken out, and resistance forces were increasingly unable to find food. With the court providing no practical support, the French gradually wore down the partisans. Định retreated into the marshes of Bien Hoa, where he attempted to reorganise his forces.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1806, the Napoleonic Wars were two years old and the first major {{campaign}} at sea, the Trafalgar campaign, was nearing its climax. A French fleet had departed Toulon in March 1805 under Vice-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, gathered Spanish ships from the Spanish Mediterranean ports and then crossed the Atlantic, under orders to disrupt British trade in the region <b>and</b> <b>seize</b> British colonies. Closely pursuing the Allied fleet was an equivalent British Royal Navy force under Vice-Admiral Lord Nelson, which reached the Caribbean on 11 June and found that Villeneuve had already begun the return journey to Europe. On 22 July 1805 the Allied fleet had fought the Battle of Cape Finisterre against a British force under Sir Robert Calder and been forced to divert south, seeking shelter in the Spanish fleet anchorage of Cadiz. Appearing off Cadiz {{a few days after}} Villeneuve's arrival, Nelson began a blockade of the Allied fleet, awaiting their emergence and preparing for battle.|$|E
