Mercedes sued Seven for defamation, and in May 2008 a NSW Supreme Court jury found the story defamed her, {{resulting}} in a settlement the next day of an undisclosed sum. Earlier, on 14 March 2007, Coren admitted {{in an interview with}} The Daily Telegraph that a private investigator hired by Seven lied <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> official to set up Mercedes.|$|E
25|$|Sindis' {{recurrent}} obsession is death, and he prophesies {{in detail}} <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> out-of-body witness to his funeral service and incineration, content that the flames would also consume his parasite. His tormented life is intertwined {{with those of}} desperate anti-heroes, including a gout-afflicted man who severs his own fingers, or a driller who was burned alive. When read as a camouflaged record of actual events in Bonciu's life, the novel reveals his claims about having been a witness to Vienna's artistic life under the Double Monarchy: Viennese writers such as Altenberg, Petzold, Wildgans, Peter Hille, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Arthur Schnitzler, Stefan Zweig appear as characters, and Endre Ady is a literary prototype. In {{one section of the}} book, Ramses discovers the beautiful Hilda, who is a painter, a muse, and the living artwork of Egon Schiele, and who ends up being eaten alive by her creator; before this happens, Hilda, Schiele and Ramses become entangled in a sadomasochistic ménage à trois.|$|E

It was released on December 2, 2008, by Jive Records as the second single from the album.

After she listened to the track for the first time, she felt inspired to create an album and a tour with a circus theme. [...] "Circus" [...] is an uptempo electropop and dance-pop song with elements of pop rock and [...] "half-rapped" [...] vocals. The song's lyrics talk <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> entertainer and putting on shows.|$|E
500|$|Mass Effect 2 was {{developed}} by BioWare and directed by Casey Hudson, who previously led {{the production of the}} first Mass Effect game. Before actual production began, BioWare created a list of goals to work towards based on feedback from fans, reviewers and internal people. The company's main goal was to [...] "create an experience that was less about being a game and more <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> experience." [...] In contrast to the exclusive focus on the main story of the original Mass Effect, Hudson explained that BioWare was interested in a plot where optional stories had as much intensity as the main story and decided that the idea of recruiting people and making them loyal to the player so that they could survive a suicide mission allowed to explore these possibilities. He noted, [...] "the funny thing is that people will say 'other than gathering your crew and building your team and getting ready for this mission, there's not much story there.' But that is the story." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Circus" [...] is an uptempo electropop and dance-pop song, with a stomp box {{beat and}} {{elements}} of pop rock. [...] The song opens {{with the sound}} of a drum and builds until Spears starts singing, [...] "There's only two types of people in the world/The ones that entertain and the ones that observe". Spears delivers confident and [...] "half-rapped" [...] vocals, with the verses having usage of synthesizers. Lyrically, the song talks <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> entertainer and putting on shows. She explains her emotions while performing in lines such as: [...] "I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins / Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break". The chorus begins with an electronic sound, while she compares herself, as well as performing to being on the center of a circus ring. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, [...] "Circus" [...] is composed in the key of F# minor with 120 beats per minute, however on the album the song is 115 beats per minute. Spears's vocal range spans from G#2 to D#5. Kelly commented that [...] "Circus" [...] was [...] "a cool way to get people dancing and having fun", but also have a slight message.|$|E

Although Christopher's condition is not stated, the book's blurb refers to Asperger syndrome, high-functioning autism, or savant syndrome. In July 2009, Haddon wrote on his blog that [...] "Curious Incident is not a book about Asperger's... if anything it's a novel about difference, <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> outsider, about seeing the world in a surprising and revealing way.

2500|$|King was {{starting}} to think <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> artist, though this was really a second choice. But art was something she could do with minimal resources, so {{long as she could}} support herself. King was influenced both by mediaeval sculpture and by Expressionist sculpture, an important part of German avant-garde art, and particularly by the work of the wood-carver, Ernst Barlach (1870–1938). The Nazis considered such art to be decadent (Entartete Kunst) and later attempted to suppress it. King went to see the artist Käthe Kollwitz (1867–1945), whose work she admired. Kollwitz’ advice to King about a career in art was “Don’t do it if you can help it. It is so difficult”. Nevertheless, King did go on. She said: “I haven’t regretted it. I agree with her, it’s difficult.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The art design crew {{included}} background artist Peter Chan and cartoonist Scott Campbell. Voice actor Richard Steven Horvitz, {{best known}} for his portrayal of Zim in the cult favorite animated series Invader Zim, provides the voice of Raz, the game's protagonist. Initially the team tried to bring in children to provide the voices for the main cast, similar to Peanuts cartoons, but struggled with their lack of acting experience. Schafer had selected Horvitz based on his audition tapes and ability to provide a wide range of vocal intonations on the spot, providing them with numerous takes to work with. Raz was originally conceived as an ostrich suffering from mental imbalance and multiple personalities. Tim Schafer killed the idea because he strongly believes in games being [...] "wish fulfillments," [...] guessing that not many people fantasize <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> insane ostrich.|$|E
2500|$|How can we {{find out}} of the single {{individual}} is ready for eternal salvation? Kierkegaard says, [...] "Any army sometimes has a select little group called the immortal battalion, and a warrior esteems it a great honor to be accepted into it. Let us suppose {{that there was a}} man who was just as concerned about being in that battalion as everyone ought to be concerned <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> heir of heaven's salvation. The conditions were sufficiently known; distinction in battle was required, but also a certain appearance, a specific height, physique, etc. He would then examine himself to see whether he filled all the requirements, not in general, not casually, because he would be too concerned for that, and he knew that if he was deficient in merely the slightest way he would not be accepted. And whether anything was lacking or everything was present in the right proportion the commander would decide in his appraisal. Can we talk about the Christian in the same way? No. Kierkegaard says, [...] "every person has heaven's salvation, only by the grace and mercy of God, and this is equally close to every human being {{in the sense that it}} is a matter between God and him; and let no third person, himself having been restored to grace, forfeit this by unwarranted interference. [...] If there was a person who embittered my life early and late and thought nothing but the worst of me, would his also being saved be able to disturb my salvation? ...|$|E
