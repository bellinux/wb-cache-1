5|$|System 6's Apple menu {{cannot be}} used to launch {{application}}s. The current application icon in the upper right-hand corner of the menu bar cycles between open applications; {{it is not a}} menu. System 6 supports 24bits of <b>addressable</b> random access memory (RAM), which allowed a maximum of 8megabytes of RAM with no provision for virtual memory. These limitations were fixed in System 7. The version of the HFS used by System 6 also has a hard drive capacity limit; it supports up to 2gigabytes (GBs) and 65,536 files on a drive. This limitation was not increased until System 7.5 which first increased the limit to 4GB.|$|E
5|$|An {{endpoint}} of a pipe is <b>addressable</b> with a tuple (device_address, endpoint_number) as {{specified in}} a TOKEN packet that the host sends when {{it wants to}} start a data transfer session. If {{the direction of the}} data transfer is from the host to the endpoint, an OUT packet (a specialization of a TOKEN packet) having the desired device address and endpoint number is sent by the host. If the direction of the data transfer is from the device to the host, the host sends an IN packet instead. If the destination endpoint is a uni-directional endpoint whose manufacturer's designated direction does not match the TOKEN packet (e.g. the manufacturer's designated direction is IN while the TOKEN packet is an OUT packet), the TOKEN packet is ignored. Otherwise, it is accepted and the data transaction can start. A bi-directional endpoint, on the other hand, accepts both IN and OUT packets.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81's primary input/output is {{delivered}} via four sockets {{on the left}} side of the case. The machine uses an ordinary UHF television set to deliver a monochrome picture via a built-in RF modulator. It can display 24 lines of 32 characters each, and by using the selection of 2×2 block character graphics from the machine's character set offers an effective 64 × 44 pixel graphics mode, also directly <b>addressable</b> via BASIC using the PLOT and UNPLOT commands, leaving 2 lines free at the bottom. Two 3.5mm jacks connect the ZX81 to the EAR (output) and MIC (input) sockets of an audio cassette recorder, enabling data to be saved or loaded. This uses an unusual PWM encoding at a single frequency, giving an average rate of 307 bps nominal, varying between 400 bps for all '0's, to 250 bps for all '1's. This provides a somewhat temperamental storage medium for the machine, which has no built-in storage capabilities. The ZX81 requires 420 mA of power at 7–11 V DC, delivered via a custom 9 V Sinclair DC power supply.|$|E
25|$|There is {{speculation}} {{of introducing}} objects without identity (value types), {{as well as}} moving towards 64-bit <b>addressable</b> arrays to support large data sets.|$|E
25|$|An <b>addressable</b> system gives each {{detector}} {{an individual}} number, or address. <b>Addressable</b> systems allow {{the exact location}} of an alarm to be plotted on the FACP, while allowing several detectors to be connected to the same zone. In certain systems, a graphical representation of the building is provided on the screen of the FACP which shows the locations of all of the detectors in the building, while in others the address and location of the detector or detectors in alarm are simply indicated.|$|E
25|$|ClearType is {{not used}} when {{printing}} text. Most printers already use such small pixels that aliasing is rarely a problem, and they don't have the <b>addressable</b> fixed subpixels ClearType requires. Nor does ClearType affect text stored in files. ClearType only applies any processing to the text while it is being rendered onto the screen.|$|E
25|$|IBM's own IBM 5100 {{microcomputer}} (1975) offered APL {{as one of}} two built-in ROM-based interpreted languages for the computer, {{complete with}} a keyboard and display that supported all the special symbols used in the language. While the 5100 was very slow and operated its screen only like a typewriter, its follower the 5110 had more acceptable performances and a read-write <b>addressable</b> text screen. Graphics could be printed on an external matrix printer.|$|E
25|$|The {{word length}} for this {{computer}} Is 27 bits, of which 24 are used In computation. The remaining 3 bits are spare and synchronizing bits. The memory storage capability {{consists of a}} 6000 rpm magnetic disk with a storage capacity of 2985 words of which 2728 are <b>addressable.</b> The contents of memory include 20 cold-storage channels of 128 sectors (words) each, a hot-storage channel of 128 sectors, four rapid access loops (U,F,E,H) of 1, 4, 8, and 16 words respectively, four 1-word arithmetic loops (A, L,H,I), and a two 4-word input buffer input loops (V,R).|$|E
25|$|Commercial smoke {{detectors}} are either conventional or <b>addressable,</b> and {{are connected to}} security alarm or fire alarm systems controlled by fire alarm control panels (FACP). These {{are the most common}} type of detector, and are usually significantly more expensive than single-station battery-operated residential smoke alarms. They are used in most commercial and industrial facilities and other places such as ships and trains, but are also part of some security alarm systems in homes. These detectors don't need to have built in alarms, as alarm systems can be controlled by the connected FACP, which will set off relevant alarms, and can also implement complex functions such as a staged evacuation.|$|E
25|$|Some smart TV {{platforms}} {{also support}} interactive advertising, <b>addressable</b> advertising with local advertising insertion and targeted advertising, and other advanced advertising {{features such as}} ad telescoping using VOD and DVR, enhanced TV for consumer call-to-action and audience measurement solutions for ad campaign effectiveness. The marketing and trading possibilities offered by Smart TVs are sometimes summarized by the term t-commerce. Taken together, this bidirectional data flow means that smart TVs can be and are used for clandestine observation of the owners. Even in sets that are not configured off-the-shelf to do so, default security measures are often weak and will allow hackers to easily break into the TV.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} view, {{from the}} world of the Semantic Web focuses instead on making all things (not just those electronic, smart, or RFID-enabled) <b>addressable</b> by the existing naming protocols, such as URI. The objects themselves do not converse, but they may now be referred to by other agents, such as powerful centralized servers acting for their human owners.Integration with the Internet implies that devices will use an IP address as a unique identifier. Due to the limited address space of IPv4 (which allows for 4.3 billion unique addresses), objects in the IoT will have to use the next generation of the Internet protocol (IPv6) to scale to the extremely large address space required.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{pinball machine}} I/O mix {{includes}} 16 to 24 outputs for driving solenoids, motors, electromagnets and other mechanical devices in the game. These devices can draw up to 500 W momentarily and operate at voltages up to 50 Vdc. There is also individually controlled lighting {{that consists of}} 64 to 96 individually <b>addressable</b> lights. Recently developed games have switched from incandescent bulbs to LEDs. And there is general illumination lighting that comprises two or more higher-power light strings connected and controlled in parallel for providing broad illumination to the playfield and backbox artwork. Additionally, 12 to 24 high-impulse lighting outputs, traditionally incandescent but now LED, provide flash effects within the game. Traditionally, these were often controlled by solenoid-level drivers.|$|E
25|$|The {{address bus}} of the PowerPC 603 can {{theoretically}} access memory up to 64 MB. However, the operating system's maximum <b>addressable</b> memory size is 37 MB. Furthermore, {{because of the}} ASIC design of the Pippin hardware, the maximum RAM size that can be added is 32 MB. Officially, Bandai produced memory upgrade modules of 2, 4, 8 and 16 MB. The memory chips are soldered onto {{a printed circuit board}} which is placed in a plastic housing, making installation into a Pippin system simple for the end user. Japanese hackers produced an aftermarket 16 MB module, but because the module was much larger than the memory module compartment on the Pippin, installation required removing the logic board from the chassis, and then mounting the large memory module in-between the logic board and chassis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Addressable</b> {{systems are}} usually more {{expensive}} than conventional non-addressable systems, and offer extra options, including a custom level of sensitivity (sometimes called Day/Night mode) which can {{determine the amount of}} smoke in a given area and contamination detection from the FACP that allows determination {{of a wide range of}} faults in detection capabilities of smoke detectors. Detectors become contaminated usually as a result of the build up of atmospheric particulates in the detectors being circulated by the heating and air-conditioning systems in buildings. Other causes include carpentry, sanding, painting, and smoke in the event of a fire. Panels can also be interconnected to monitor a very large number of detectors in multiple buildings. This is most commonly used in hospitals, universities, resorts and other large centres or institutions.|$|E
25|$|Glare-free {{high beam}} is a camera-driven dynamic {{lighting}} control strategy that selectively shades spots and slices {{out of the}} high beam pattern to protect other road users from glare, while always providing the driver with maximum seeing range. The area surrounding other road users is constantly illuminated at high beam intensity, but without the glare that would result from using uncontrolled high beams in traffic. This constantly changing beam pattern requires complex sensors, microprocessors and actuators, because the vehicles which must be shadowed out of the beam are constantly moving. The dynamic shadowing can be achieved with movable shadow masks shifted within the light path inside the headlamp. Or, the effect {{can be achieved by}} selectively darkening <b>addressable</b> LED emitters or reflector elements, a technique known as 'Pixel light'.|$|E
25|$|With {{the opening}} of its newest store located in Colonie Plaza in Colonie, New York on June 2, 2009, Price Chopper has made {{investments}} to incorporate various green and energy-saving initiatives throughout the store. Green features include a 400kW United Technologies Corp. natural gas fuel cell which provides {{a significant amount of}} power (60% as quoted by Price Chopper) for the store. Abundant skylighting and an <b>addressable</b> lighting control system from Encelium Technologies both allow the store to dim its lighting when enough daylight is present. Occupancy sensors covering nearly the entire layout of the store including all offices, backrooms, and loading docks ensure the lights are automatically switched off or significantly dimmed when vacant for a certain period of time. Even aisle ways and other areas of the main sales floor are dimmed unless that aisle or section is occupied.|$|E
25|$|The first Soviet {{programmable}} desktop calculator ISKRA 123, {{powered by}} the power grid, was released {{at the start of}} the 1970s. The first Soviet pocket battery-powered programmable calculator, Elektronika B3-21, was developed by the end of 1977 and released at the start of 1978. The successor of B3-21, the Elektronika B3-34 wasn't backward compatible with B3-21, even if it kept the reverse Polish notation (RPN). Thus B3-34 defined a new command set, which later was used in a series of later programmable Soviet calculators. Despite very limited abilities (98 bytes of instruction memory and about 19 stack and <b>addressable</b> registers), people managed to write all kinds of programs for them, including adventure games and libraries of calculus-related functions for engineers. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of programs were written for these machines, from practical scientific and business software, which were used in real-life offices and labs, to fun games for children. The Elektronika MK-52 calculator (using the extended B3-34 command set, and featuring internal EEPROM memory for storing programs and external interface for EEPROM cards and other periphery) was used in Soviet spacecraft program (for Soyuz TM-7 flight) as a backup of the board computer.|$|E

2500|$|There are two low-resolution and two bitmapped modes. The {{multicolor}} bitmapped mode has an <b>addressable</b> {{screen of}} 160×200 pixels, {{with a maximum}} of four colors per 4×8 character block.

2500|$|The Final Rule on Security Standards {{was issued}} on February 20, 2003.

While the Privacy Rule pertains to all Protected Health Information (PHI) including paper and electronic, the Security Rule deals specifically with Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI). It lays out {{three types of}} security safeguards required for compliance: administrative, physical, and technical. For each of these types, the Rule identifies various security standards, and for each standard, it names both required and <b>addressable</b> implementation specifications. Required specifications must be adopted and administered as dictated by the Rule. <b>Addressable</b> specifications are more flexible.

2500|$|In DOS memory management, {{conventional}} memory, {{also called}} base memory, {{is the first}} 640 kilobytes (...) of the memory on IBM PC or compatible systems. It is the read-write memory directly <b>addressable</b> by the processor {{for use by the}} operating system and application programs. As memory prices rapidly declined, this design decision became a limitation in the use of large memory capacities until the introduction of operating systems and processors that made it irrelevant.|$|E
2500|$|The {{limits of}} {{specific}} approaches {{continue to be}} tested, as boundaries are reached through large scale experiments, e.g., in 2011 IBM ended its participation in the Blue Waters petaflops project at the University of Illinois. The Blue Waters architecture {{was based on the}} IBM POWER7 processor and intended to have 200,000 cores with a petabyte of [...] "globally <b>addressable</b> memory" [...] and 10 petabytes of disk space. The goal of a sustained petaflop led to design choices that optimized single-core performance, and hence a lower number of cores. The lower number of cores was then expected to help performance on programs that did not scale well to a large number of processors. The large globally <b>addressable</b> memory architecture aimed to solve memory address problems in an efficient manner, for the same type of programs. Blue Waters had been expected to run at sustained speeds of at least one petaflop, and relied on the specific water-cooling approach to manage heat. In the first four years of operation, the National Science Foundation spent about $200 million on the project. IBM released the Power 775 computing node derived from that project's technology soon thereafter, but effectively abandoned the Blue Waters approach.|$|E

2500|$|Architectural {{experiments}} are continuing {{in a number}} of directions, e.g. the Cyclops64 system uses a [...] "supercomputer on a chip" [...] approach, in a direction away from the use of massive distributed processors. Each 64-bit Cyclops64 chip contains 80 processors, and the entire system uses a globally <b>addressable</b> memory architecture. The processors are connected with non-internally blocking crossbar switch and communicate with each other via global interleaved memory. There is no data cache in the architecture, but half of each SRAM bank {{can be used as a}} scratchpad memory. Although this type of architecture allows unstructured parallelism in a dynamically non-contiguous memory system, it also produces challenges in the efficient mapping of parallel algorithms to a many-core system.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the past}} {{it was thought}} that the {{diagnosis}} of IBS relied on a diagnosis of exclusion; that is, if one cannot find a cause then IBS is the diagnosis. Currently the diagnosis of IBS relies on meeting Rome II inclusion criteria (updated by Rome III criteria) and excluding other illnesses based on history, physical exam, and laboratory testing. Although the Rome II and III criteria were not designed to be management guidelines, they are currently a [...] "gold standard" [...] for the diagnosis of IBS. Unfortunately, an IBS diagnosis in an adult patient is still only useful as a tool to rule out more serious problems unless further investigation is employed to discern an <b>addressable</b> condition.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the years}} {{immediately}} following the dot-com crash, many investors sought an early exit from their outstanding commitments to the private equity asset class, particularly venture capital. [...] As a result, the nascent secondary market became an increasingly active sector within private equity in these years. [...] Secondary transaction volume increased from historical levels of 2% or 3% of private equity commitments to 5% of the <b>addressable</b> market. [...] Many of the largest financial institutions (e.g., Deutsche Bank, Abbey National, UBS AG) sold portfolios of direct investments and “pay-to-play” funds portfolios that were typically used {{as a means to}} gain entry to lucrative leveraged finance and mergers and acquisitions assignments but had created {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} of losses.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design of}} the {{original}} IBM PC placed the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) memory map and other hardware in the 384 KB upper memory area (UMA). The need for more RAM grew faster than the needs of hardware to utilize the reserved addresses, which resulted in RAM eventually being mapped into these unused upper areas to utilize all available <b>addressable</b> space. This introduced a reserved [...] "hole" [...] (or several holes) into the set of addresses occupied by hardware {{that could be used}} for arbitrary data. Avoiding such a hole was difficult and ugly and not supported by DOS or most programs that could run on it. Later, space between the holes would be used as upper memory blocks (UMBs).|$|E
2500|$|The {{architecture}} of the MPACT! media processor was distinguished in that it used a large <b>addressable</b> SRAM in place of registers, but had 4 special purpose registers {{for being able to}} address its 72 bit SRAM entries indirectly (a feature also seen in Intel's Itanium processor). [...] By being based on 9 bit bytes instead of 8 bit bytes, this was the equivalent of adding a sign bit to each byte which is very useful for MPEG decoding. [...] One of the founders was also a founder of RAMBUS, and not surprisingly, the MPACT used RDRAM as its memory technology. [...] The chip could DMA data into contiguous SRAM entries asynchronously with other ALU operations which made the design very parallel and able to absorb the long latencies of RAMBUS's RDRAM while sustaining high throughput.|$|E
2500|$|Summers then {{concluded}} {{his discussion}} of the three hypotheses by saying: [...] So my best guess, to provoke you, of what's behind all of this is that the largest phenomenon, by far, is the general clash between people's legitimate family desires and employers' current desire for high power and high intensity, that in the special case of science and engineering, there are issues of intrinsic aptitude, and particularly of the variability of aptitude, and that those considerations are reinforced by what are in fact lesser factors involving socialization and continuing discrimination. I would like nothing better than to be proved wrong, because I would like nothing better than for these problems to be <b>addressable</b> simply by everybody understanding what they are, and working very hard to address them. Summers then went on to discuss approaches to remedying the shortage of women in high-end science and engineering positions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{implementation}} of these cmdlet classes {{can refer to}} any [...]NET API and may be in any [...]NET language. In addition, PowerShell makes certain APIs available, such as WriteObject (...) , {{which is used to}} access PowerShell-specific functionality, such as writing resultant objects to the pipeline. Cmdlets can use [...]NET data access APIs directly or use the PowerShell infrastructure of PowerShell Providers, which make data stores <b>addressable</b> using unique paths. Data stores are exposed using drive letters, and hierarchies within them, addressed as directories. Windows PowerShell ships with providers for the file system, registry, the certificate store, as well as the namespaces for command aliases, variables, and functions. Windows PowerShell also includes various cmdlets for managing various Windows systems, including the file system, or using Windows Management Instrumentation to control Windows components. Other applications can register cmdlets with PowerShell, thus allowing it to manage them, and, if they enclose any datastore (such as databases), they can add specific providers as well.|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] "conventional" [...] is slang used to {{distinguish}} the method used {{to communicate with the}} control unit in newer <b>addressable</b> systems. So called [...] "conventional detectors" [...] are smoke detectors used in older interconnected systems and resemble electrical switches by their way of working. These detectors are connected in parallel to the signaling path so that the current flow is monitored to indicate a closure of the circuit path by any connected detector when smoke or other similar environmental stimulus sufficiently influences any detector. The resulting increase in current flow (or a dead short) is interpreted and processed by the control unit as a confirmation of the presence of smoke and a fire alarm signal is generated. In a conventional system, smoke detectors are typically wired together in each zone and a single fire alarm control panel usually monitors a number of zones which can be arranged to correspond to different areas of a building. In the event of a fire, the control panel is able to identify which zone or zones contain the detector or detectors in alarm, but can not identify which individual detector or detectors {{are in a state of}} alarm.|$|E
