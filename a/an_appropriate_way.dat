5|$|Matsueda {{is noted}} for her jazzy style, which she often {{incorporated}} into the soundtracks she worked on; she also touched on genres like jazz fusion, lounge, and ambient. For the scores that she collaborated on with Eguchi, she was {{responsible for most of}} the jazzy tracks, while Eguchi provided the majority of the electronic music. Matsueda has said that the best qualities of a composer are their curiosity and sensitivity, and that watching many things, listening, touching, and feeling are important factors in composition. When asked why she creates music, Matsueda replied that she feels it is <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>way</b> to express herself.|$|E
5|$|Abi invites Dot to Christmas in Exeter but Dot insists she {{has plans}} of her own. The {{launderette}} closes on Christmas Eve, but everyone is {{too busy to}} visit her. She finds a Christmas mixtape recorded by her now-deceased friend Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), and takes in a stray cat, which she eventually names Dave. She spends Christmas Day alone, but when Patrick realises she has not gone to Exeter, he invites her to The Queen Victoria pub where everyone is celebrating Christmas, and her neighbours present her with the gift of a washing machine. When Ronnie, the wife of Dot's former stepson, Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), and her sister Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), mother of one of Jack's children, both die, Dot tells the children {{that they are in}} heaven, helping them to understand after Jack struggles to find <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>way</b> to tell them. When Jack is unable to take Dot to the garden centre, she decides to drive herself with her great-grandson, Matthew Mitchell Cotton, but drives through a no entry sign into oncoming traffic and ends up in the verge. Dot is surprised when Charlie returns {{but it turns out that}} he's only back for his son. Dot's step granddaughter Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) lives with her for a while but moves out with Dot's blessing. Dot is surprised when Charlie returns but is left upset when Charlie leaves to go back to Ireland with Mathew, also upsetting Jack. Dot and Jack are unaware this is part of Max Branning's (Jake Wood) evil revenge for his false imprisonment.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, {{with support}} of the UK Government's Department of Health, {{a wide range of}} UK organisations signed a {{memorandum}} of understanding (MoU) setting out an agreed framework for activities by parties concerned to help address the issues raised by the practice of conversion therapy in the UK. In addition to many of the professional bodies that previously issued the consensus statement, signatories included the UK Association of Christian Counsellors, the Royal College of General Practitioners, NHS England and NHS Scotland. The signatory organisations recognised a shared commitment to protecting the public from the risks of conversion therapy. They committed to raise awareness among healthcare professionals and psychological therapists of ethical issues involved in conversion therapy and to provide training to enable therapists to support clients in distress in <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E

The Resolution gives {{for the first}} time, a special recognition to all humanitarian and United Nations and associated personnel who have worked in {{the promotion of the}} humanitarian cause and those who have lost their lives in the cause of duty and urges all Member States, entities of the United Nations within existing resources, {{as well as the other}} International Organizations and Non-Governmental Organizations to observe it annually in <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>way.</b> It marks the day on which the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General to Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello and his 21 colleagues were killed following the bombing of the UN Headquarters in Baghdad.|$|E
25|$|Dr Michael Dixon was {{appointed}} the Foundation's medical director. From 2005 to 2007, FIH received {{a grant from}} the Department of Health to help organise the self-regulation of complementary therapies. There had been concern that with {{a large proportion of the}} public turning to complementary approaches, there were few safeguards in place to ensure that non-statutorily regulated therapists were safe, trained and would act in <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>way.</b> FIH worked to bring together the representative bodies of many complementary professions to talk and agree standards. The result was the formation of the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC) which had hoped to register 10,000 practitioners of complementary medicine by the end of 2009 but which by September 2009 had succeeded in enrolling less than a tenth of that number due to lack of interest on the part of some of their professional associations. The Department of Health is currently continuing to fund the CNHC but future funding will be dependent on substantial progress being made towards the target (which has now been reduced to 2,000). Alternative medicine campaigners argued that the move toward regulation conferred undue respectability on unproven and possibly unsafe CAM approaches.|$|E

500|$|Another {{important}} strategic {{question in}} the middlegame is whether and how to reduce material and transition into an endgame (i.e. [...] ). Minor material advantages can generally be transformed into victory only in an endgame, and therefore the stronger side must choose <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>way</b> to achieve an ending. Not every reduction of material is good for this purpose; for example, if one side keeps a light-squared bishop and the opponent has a dark-squared one, the transformation into a bishops and pawns ending is usually advantageous for the weaker side only, because an endgame with bishops on opposite colors {{is likely to be}} a draw, even with an advantage of a pawn, or sometimes even with a two-pawn advantage.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{argues that}} Val Plumwood is {{incorrect}} {{to declare the}} resituation of animals into ethical terms as supererogatory {{as opposed to the}} necessary resituation of humans into ecological terms, as the two tasks are linked. Smith rejects the culture/nature dichotomy, and suggests that a politics of recognition is <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>way</b> to think about relationships. She draws upon feminist and ecofeminist literature to conceive of recognition theory beyond intersubjective self/other relations, allowing recognition beyond a human self, a concept which she challenges. Smith seeks to show that recognition theories should not be considered [...] "soft" [...] or [...] "naive" [...] as accounts of justice, and instead that they offer an appropriate mode for thinking about ecological and animal injustices.|$|E

30|$|The {{usage of}} NFR catalogs in the AORE context is not totally appropriate, since these catalogs are not {{prepared}} for the software concern domain and fail to consider some specific properties of this area. For example, they do not contain information about functional requirements and their relationships. According to Moreira et al. [17], functional requirements also may cut across other software requirements; hence, {{it is important to}} take them into account during the concern identification and classification activities. Furthermore, although these approaches suggest the usage of NFR catalogs, they do not present guidelines or processes that indicate how to use them in <b>an</b> <b>appropriated</b> <b>way.</b>|$|R
500|$|Chapman's {{team won}} the second Test comfortably after scoring 636 in their first innings, the highest team total in Tests at that time. In the third Test, England began the fourth innings {{requiring}} 332 to win on a rain-damaged pitch, a task critics believed impossible. A large opening partnership from Hobbs and Sutcliffe gave England a chance, and Hobbs {{sent a message to}} the England dressing room suggesting a tactical change in the batting order. But the team could not find Chapman, who according to Percy Fender, in attendance as a journalist, {{spent most of his time}} socialising with guests in the Ladies' Stand. Consequently, the team followed Hobbs' plan without the approval of the captain. England's batsmen took the total to within 14 of victory when the fourth wicket fell. Chapman came in and batted in an unusual way; after attempting some big shots, he played ultra-defensively, possibly in an attempt to allow Patsy Hendren to reach fifty runs before England won. Hendren was out soon after, then Chapman tried to hit a six and was caught. The batsmen continued to play recklessly and a further wicket fell to a run out. Douglas describes the end of the match: [...] "Meanwhile, [...] was quite unruffled by the sudden upsets. He wound up for the next delivery and thumped it through mid-on for 4, bellowing, 'Dammit, we've done 'em!' It was <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>way</b> for a side under Chapman to win the Ashes." [...] England's victory in the third Test ensured the Ashes were retained, and the team also won the fourth Test to take a 4–0 lead in the series.|$|E
