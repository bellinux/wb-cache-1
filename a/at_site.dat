25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that the mean percent methylation of H19 CpGs at sites 13 and 14, after the transcription start site, is insignificant between normal, hyperplasia, adenoma and carcinoma adrenals.

Another point of interest is the significant difference in CpG methylation <b>at</b> <b>site</b> 11 between normal and hyperplasia adrenals. The mean percent CpG methylation <b>at</b> <b>site</b> 11 for hyperplasia and adenoma adrenals is significantly different from that of normal adrenals and carcinoma adrenals, leading Gao et al. to suggest that site 11 is the initial methylated CpG that eventually leads to widespread methylation of the H19 promoter.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{evaluated}} {{the relationship of}} dominant watershed land use to the structure and function of riparian zones with respect to nitrogen (N) dynamics. We focused on ground-water denitrification capacity, water table dynamics and the presence and pattern of organically-enriched deposits. We used the push-pull method (measurement of 15 N-enriched denitrification gases derived from an introduced ground-water plume of 15 N-enriched nitrate) to evaluate ground-water denitrification capacity on nine forested wetland riparian sites developed in alluvial or outwash parent materials in Southern New England. Three replicate sites were located in watersheds dominated by irrigated agriculture, suburban and forest. Soil morphology and water table dynamics were also assessed <b>at</b> each <b>site.</b> We found significantly lower mean annual water tables <b>at</b> <b>sites</b> within watersheds dominated by irrigated agriculture or suburban development versus forested watersheds. Water table dynamics were more variable <b>at</b> <b>sites</b> within suburban watersheds, experiencing greater extremes, especially during the summer. Ground-water denitrification capacity was significantly greater <b>at</b> <b>sites</b> within forested watersheds than <b>at</b> <b>sites</b> within watersheds dominated by irrigated agriculture. Because of {{the high degree of}} variability of sites within suburban watersheds, ground-water denitrification capacity was not significantly different from either forested or agricultural watersheds.
