25|$|<b>Aprepitant</b> ({{brand name}}: Emend (the brand name used in all English-speaking countries)) is an {{antiemetic}} chemical compound {{that belongs to}} a class of drugs called substance P antagonists (SPA). It mediates its effect by blocking the neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor.|$|E
25|$|Nausea and vomiting: {{cisplatin}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} emetogenic chemotherapy agents, but this symptom is managed with prophylactic antiemetics (ondansetron, granisetron, etc.) in combination with corticosteroids. <b>Aprepitant</b> combined with ondansetron and dexamethasone has been shown to be better for highly emetogenic chemotherapy than just ondansetron and dexamethasone.|$|E
25|$|Co-administration of {{atorvastatin}} {{with one}} of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole, may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions. This {{is less likely to}} happen with other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, protease inhibitors, or verapamil, and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as amiodarone and <b>aprepitant.</b> Often, bosentan, fosphenytoin, and phenytoin, which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, and rifamycin, which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Oral contraceptives increased AUC values for norethisterone and ethinylestradiol; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Aprepitant</b> {{is taken}} orally {{in the form}} of a capsule.

Despite achieving 90-95% receptor occupancy of <b>aprepitant</b> in certain brain regions, negative clinical results were observed in three actively controlled studies. The company has since abandoned plans to market <b>aprepitant</b> 160 mg as an antidepressant. Subsequently, large clinically positive double blind controlled studies with two additional NK1 receptor antagonists, casopitant, and orvepitant [...] (both GlaxoSmithKine compounds) have been published in peer reviewed medical journals. This work now replicates the early findings of Merck and Co with <b>aprepitant</b> and L-759,274, and of Pfizer with CP-122,721. Arguably, the weight of preclinical data and unambiguous positive clinical evidence (in over 2000 patients studied in five well-controlled RCTs, of five separate compounds tested at 2 or more dose levels conducted by three independent labs) provides critical evidence that NK1 receptor antagonism, including that of <b>aprepitant,</b> is an authentically distinct antidepressant mechanism. Across all these studies, efficacy appeared to be dose-related. Only mild, transient, and tolerable side effects, not those typically observed with either the SSRI, SNRI, or NRI classes of antidepressants, have been observed.|$|E

5000|$|Shortly after Merck {{initiated}} {{research into}} the reducing the severity and likelihood of CINV, researchers discovered that <b>aprepitant</b> is effective in prevention. Researchers worked on {{coming up with a}} process to create <b>aprepitant,</b> and within a short period they came up with effective synthesis of the substance. This original synthesis was deemed to be workable and proved to be a crucial step in achieving commercialization; however, Merck decided that the process was not environmentally sustainable. This was due to the original synthesis requiring six steps, many of which needed dangerous chemicals such as sodium cyanide, dimethyltitanocene, and gaseous ammonia. In addition to this, for the process to be effective cryogenic temperatures were needed for some of the steps and other steps produced hazardous byproducts such as methane and magnesium chloride. [...] The environmental concerns of the synthesis of <b>aprepitant</b> became so great that Merck research team decided to withdraw the drug from clinical trials and attempt to create a different synthesis of <b>aprepitant.</b>|$|E

50|$|Beyond {{suggestions}} that PET receptor occupancy {{must not be}} used routinely to cap dosing for new medical indications for this class, or that > 99% human receptor occupancy might be required for consistent psycho-pharmacological or other therapeutic effects, critical scientific dissection and debate of the above data might be needed to enable <b>aprepitant,</b> and the class of NK1 antagonists as a whole, to fulfill preclinically predicted utilities beyond CINV (i.e., for other psychiatric disorders, addictions, neuropathic pain, migraine, osteoarthritis, overactive bladder, inflammatory bowel disease, and other disorders with suspected inflammatory or immunological components (see anti-cancer below.) However, most data remain proprietary and thus reviews on the expanded clinical potential for drugs like <b>aprepitant</b> range from optimistic to crepe-hanging.|$|E
