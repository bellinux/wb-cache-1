Based on the analysis of deformational and structural characteristics of surrounding rock in CMCB panels, the methods of theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and engineering test are employed.

Correspondingly, the stable period of internal pressure of backfill body in the gob is shortened.

Pre-wetting the coal seam with water injection is widely considered as one of the effective means of mitigating coal dust generation during mining. Injecting water through inseam long boreholes parallel to the working face is a commonly used technique. However, for most fully-mechanised top-coal caving working faces, inseam gas drainage boreholes are drilled to extract gas from the gassy seam prior to mining. Therefore, there is neither enough time nor space at the working site for an elaborated water injection process. Based on the mining conditions at Panel 9801 of the Yangquan coalfield, this study designed a water injection system through the inseam gas drainage boreholes to control dust arising from the longwall face. Under the influence of <b>abutment</b> <b>pressure,</b> water injection through a set of inseam gas drainage boreholes was experimentally investigated to offset the conflict between water injection and gas drainage in terms of the time and space availability. The relations between the amount of injected water, the injection rate, the seam moisture content and the coal dust level at the working space were investigated. The effect of water injection for dust control at different distances ahead of working face was assessed. With the change of <b>abutment</b> <b>pressure,</b> the effect of water injection to inseam gas drainage and gas emission at working face was revealed and a space-time balance between gas drainage and dust control by water injection was established. The results indicate that under the influence of <b>abutment</b> <b>pressure,</b> water injection through inseam gas drainage boreholes wetted the seam and decreased the dust level at the working face. Water injection only has marginal influence on inseam borehole drainage and has a negligible impact on the gas level produced at the working face.

This paper defines the extremely close coal seam and studies the unconventional staggered distance simultaneous mining in pressure-relief region formed by locating the lower coal mining face in the upper face. The mechanical model of unconventional staggered distance simultaneous mining is established and its theoretical formula is given.

40|$|Generally, {{knowledge}} of stress redistribution around the longwall panel causes {{a better understanding}} of the mechanisms that lead to ground failure, especially to rock bursts. In this paper, passive seismic velocity tomography is used to demonstrate the state of stress around the longwall mining panel. The mining-induced microseismic events were recorded by mounting an array of receivers on the surface, above the active panel. To determine the location of seismic events and execute the process of tomography, double difference method is employed as a local earthquake tomography. Since passive sources are used, the ray coverage is insufficient to achieve the quality images required. The wave velocity is assumed to be the regionalized variable and it is therefore estimated in a denser network, by using geostatistical estimation method. Subsequently, the three dimensional images of wave velocity are created and are sliced into the coal seam. These images clearly illustrate the stressed zones that they are appropriately in compliance with the theoretical models. Such compliance is particularly apparent in the front <b>abutment</b> <b>pressure</b> and the side <b>abutment</b> <b>pressure</b> near the tailgate entry. Movements of the stressed zones along the advancing face are also evident. The research conclusion proves that the combined method, based on double-difference tomography and geostatistical estimation, can potentially be used to monitor stress changes around the longwall mining panel continuously. Such observation could lead to substantial improvement in both productivity and safety of mining operations...|$|R

In this paper, {{the characteristics of}} deformation and failure of the entry were investigated {{in terms of the}} tempo-spatial relations between heading and working faces through field study and numerical modeling. The three-dimensional (3 D) finite difference models were built to investigate stresses, displacements and damages in the surrounding rocks of the entry and the working face. The field study includes selection of reinforcing methods and materials, design parameters, and determination of cable prestress. The monitoring data of entry deformation and stress along the cables during every stage were presented. The state of the reinforced entry was evaluated based on the monitoring data. The results demonstrate that before the heading face of the entry crosses the adjacent working face, the influence of advanced <b>abutment</b> <b>pressure</b> caused by adjacent working face upon the entry is not significant. After they cross each other, however, the lateral <b>abutment</b> <b>pressure</b> will have an evident impact on the entry.

The fully-grouted cable with short length, high strength and high prestress is an effective way to reinforce the entry suffering from severe mining-induced stresses, which greatly reduces the displacement and failure possibility of the entry. Finally, the principles and recommendations for reinforcing design of entries suffering from severe mining-induced stresses were proposed according to field study, numerical modeling and experiences from other coal mines.

30|$|After {{the coal}} {{extraction}} at the No. 8105 coalface, {{under the influence}} of coal extraction, there were some variations in stress distribution of the surrounding rock in the roadway. The stress concentration occurred in coal and rock body in front of the coalface and in the surrounding rock of the roadway, resulting in the deformation of surrounding rocks in the roadway. The roadway surface displacement was monitored in the No. 5105 roadway within a 100  m range in front of the No. 8105 coalface, the monitoring results are shown in Fig.  72 b. As {{can be seen from the}} figure, there was no change for the roadway surface displacement exceeding 78  m from the coalface, the roadway deformation affected by the coalface <b>abutment</b> <b>pressure</b> appeared from a location 78  m in front of the coalface. Within 78 – 66  m range in front of the coalface, large deformations occurred at the same time in the roof and two walls. Subsequently, the deformation increased as the coalface advanced slowly. Within 36  m range from coalface, with the advance of the coalface, the deformation began to dramatically increase. In the location of the monitoring station 5  m away from the coalface, the two side walls of the roadway moved closer by 280  mm, the roof and floor closer by 210  mm. However, in general there was no obvious damage to the surrounding rock of the roadway during the coal extraction period, the amount of deformation was small, and the transportation and ventilation requirements was fully able to be met.|$|R
