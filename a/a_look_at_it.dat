25|$|In 1990, Griffin had {{an ambitious}} but {{unsuccessful}} attempt at adapting the venerable board game Monopoly {{into a game}} show of the same name. His last game show was a wild game show called Ruckus, which emanated from the Resorts International Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City, which he owned at the time. Involving slapstick stunts and a somewhat truncated version of his old Reach for the Stars, the show initially aired locally in New York, {{with the intent of}} national syndication early the following year. The Amazing Johnathan left the show after 65 episodes because of a contract dispute and the show was scrapped before it was to be nationally syndicated. A national audience did get <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> via reruns that aired for a time on GSN.|$|E
500|$|Tchaikovsky began {{showing a}} keen {{interest}} in Glazunov shortly after hearing about the premiere of Glazunov's First Symphony from Taneyev. At that time, Tchaikovsky wrote Balakirev, [...] "Glazunov interests me greatly. Is there any chance that this young man could send me the symphony so that I might take <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it?</b> I should also like to know whether he completed it, either conceptually or practically, with your or Rimsky-Korsakov's help." [...] Balakirev replied, [...] "You ask about Glazunov. He is a very talented young man who studied for a year under Rimsky-Korsakov. When he composed his symphony, he did not need any help." [...] Tchaikovsky studied the score for Glazunov's First String Quartet, and wrote his brother Modest, [...] "Despite its imitation of Korsakov ... a remarkable talent is discernible." [...] Glazunov later sent Tchaikovsky a copy of his Poème lyrique for orchestra, about which Tchaikovsky had written enthusiastically to Balakirev, and had recommended for publication to his publisher P. Jurgenson.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2009, Valve flew two of {{the boycott}} group's most {{prominent}} members to Valve, in order to playtest Left 4 Dead 2; the two felt that the sequel was well done. This event, {{through a series of}} correspondences made in jest, shortly led to Valve's Gabe Newell and designer Erik Johnson flying to Australia to visit [...] "Joe W-A", a Left 4 Dead modder. Newell jokingly reported that Valve was [...] "boycotting" [...] Joe's new mod for the game when Joe asked when he would be flown to Valve {{in the same manner as}} the Left 4 Dead 2 boycotters, but whimsically offered that if Joe was to pay to fly him to the country, he would take <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> Joe was able to raise the required funds, US$3000, through donations through his website, though ultimately Newell paid for the trip himself, with Joe's collected donations going to the Child's Play charity.|$|E
