50|$|<b>Alphacetylmethadol</b> (INN), or α-acetylmethadol (AAM), is a {{synthetic}} opioid analgesic. Its levorotary enantiomer, levacetylmethadol, is an FDA-approved treatment for opioid addiction. <b>Alphacetylmethadol</b> {{is very similar}} in structure to methadone, a widely prescribed treatment for opioid addiction. In the United States, it is a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (presumably because it was never marketed in the US, {{as is the case}} with other common opiate/opioid medications such as diacetylmorphine and alphaprodine), with an ACSCN of 9603 and a 2013 annual manufacturing quota of 2 grammes.|$|E
50|$|Betacetylmethadol is a {{synthetic}} opioid. It is a diastereoisomer of <b>alphacetylmethadol</b> (as well as levacetylmethadol). In the United States, betacetylmethadol is a Schedule I drug Narcotic under the Controlled Substances Act, with an ACSCN of 9607 and a 2 gramme manufacturing quota as of 2014.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{acetylmethadol}} and {{its individual}} isomers are all Schedule I drugs under the Controlled Substances Act, except LAAM, which is Schedule II {{and was used}} clinically until 1993. Acetylmethadol has an ACSCN of 9601. The isomers have individual ACSCNs, which are as follows: <b>Alphacetylmethadol</b> 9603, Betacetylmethadol 9607, LAAM 9648. All of the above have annual manufacturing quotas of 2 grammes as of 2013, except LAAM, which is 4 grammes.|$|E
50|$|Alphamethadol (INN), or α-methadol, {{also known}} as alfametadol, is a {{synthetic}} opioid analgesic. It is an isomer of dimepheptanol (methadol), the other being betamethadol (β-methadol). Alphamethadol is composed of two isomers itself, L-α-methadol, and D-α-methadol. The former compound, L-α-methadol, is an important active metabolite of levacetylmethadol (LAAM), an opioid substitute drug that is used clinically. Both of alphamethadol's isomers bind to and activate the μ-opioid receptor and are active as opioid analgesics, similarly to those of <b>alphacetylmethadol</b> (α-acetylmethadol).|$|E
5000|$|Levomethadyl acetate is the levo isomer of α-methadyl acetate. The dextro isomer, <b>alphacetylmethadol,</b> is {{more potent}} but shorter acting. The levo isomer is also less toxic with an [...] in mice of 110 mg/kg s.c. and 172.8 mg/kg orally {{as opposed to}} s of 61 mg/kg s.c. and 118.3 mg/kg orally for dl-α-methadyl acetate. It has a melting point of 215 °C and a {{molecular}} weight of 353.50. β-methadyl acetate also exists, however it is more toxic and less active than α-methadyl acetate and has no current medical use.|$|E
50|$|Acetylmethadol (INN), {{also known}} as methadyl acetate (USAN), is a {{synthetic}} opioid analgesic. It is a racemic mixture of <b>alphacetylmethadol</b> (α-acetylmethadol) and betacetylmethadol (β-acetylmethadol), which are in turn racemic mixtures of levacetylmethadol (LAAM; L-α-acetylmethadol) and D-α-acetylmethadol and L-β-acetylmethadol and D-β-acetylmethadol, respectively. Hence, acetylmethadol has four possible optical isomers. All of these isomers {{have been shown to}} partially or fully substitute for the discriminative stimulus effects of heroin in rats, and thus it can be inferred that, in addition to LAAM which is used clinically as such, they are all likely to be active opioid analgesics in humans.|$|E
