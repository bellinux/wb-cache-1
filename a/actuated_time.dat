40|$|Abstract. A {{magnetic}} {{linear actuator}} drop-on-demand printhead with interchangeable components is designed and fabricated. The manufacturing processes of all parts {{are carried out}} with simple techniques. A droplet generation relies on a linear motion from a piston inside a printhead chamber that causes a pressure wave to push an ink out from a nozzle-aperture. The motion is actuated by a voice coil liked actuator. The voltage applied across the actuator is {{significantly lower than the}} piezo actuator. The interchangeable components enable rapid configuration of a printhead to suit wide range of ink-materials. The prototype of our printhead was tested with inks prepared from glycerin-water solutions. The operability of the printhead was evaluated at <b>actuated</b> <b>time</b> ranging from 2 – 100 milliseconds. Our printhead was able to jet a single droplet of ink with viscosity up to 35 mPa. s. The drop size is comparable to other types of printheads...|$|E
40|$|Mission Statement The {{purpose of}} this project is to design, build, and test a thrust-vectoring rocket nozzle which will aid in {{controlling}} the trajectory of a solid-booster rocket. The system prototype must meet the requirements set forth by the sponsoring enterprise. The Enterprise Stellar Exploration is a small space systems technology company located in San Luis Obispo, CA. Stellar Exploration is currently seeking a thrust-vectoring system for its Silver Sword rocket. Project Scope The design and analysis portion of this project accounted for a system that would be mounted on to a rocket for operational flight. Therefore, this team has taken into account the effects of heat, pressure, in-flight forces, etc. However, the building and testing phase of the project only sought to establish that the system can be satisfactorily <b>actuated.</b> <b>Time</b> and financial requirements did not allow this team to test the system design for all possible operational parameters such as heat, etc. Therefore, the Appendices and all chapters preceding chapter 8 regard a prototype which must undergo operational conditions. A portion of chapter 8 and all of chapter 9 regard a prototype which only demonstrates actuation. Personnel The project was taken up by Cal Poly San Luis Obispo students Dane Larkin, and Harsimran Singh.

The analysis of such accident could be performed using best estimate thermal-hydraulic codes, such as RELAP 5. This study focuses on analysis of LOCA in TRIGA- 2000 due to pipe and beam tube break. The objective is to understand the effect of break size and the <b>actuating</b> <b>time</b> of the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) on the accident consequences and to assess the safety of the reactor. The analysis is performed using RELAP/SCDAPSIM codes. Three different break size and <b>actuating</b> <b>time</b> were studied. The results confirmed that the larger break size, the faster coolant blow down. But, the siphon break holes could prevent the core from risk of dry out due to siphoning effect in case of pipe break. In case of beam tube rupture, the ECCS is able to delay the fuel temperature increased where the late actuation of the ECCS could delay longer. It could be concluded that the safety of the reactor is kept during LOCA throughout the duration time studied. However, to assure the integrity of the fuel for the long term, the cooling system after ECCS last should be considered.   Keywords: safety analysis, LOCA, TRIGA, RELAP 5   STUDI PARAMETRIK LOCA DI TRIGA- 2000 MENGGUNAKAN RELAP 5 /SCDAP.

Penelitian ini menekankan pada analisis LOCA di TRIGA- 2000 akibat pecahnya pipa dan tabung berkas. Tujuan penelitian adalah memahami efek ukuran kebocoran dan waktu aktuasi sistem pendingin teras darurat (ECCS) pada sekuensi kejadian dan mengkaji keselamatan reaktor. Analisis dilakukan menggunakan program perhitungan RELAP/SCDAPSIM. Tiga ukuran kebocoran dan waktu aktuasi ECCS berbeda dipilih sebagai parameter dalam studi ini.   Hasil perhitungan mengonfirmasi bahwa semakin besar ukuran kebocoran, semakin cepat pengosongan tangki reaktor.

We identify various conditions on the network structure that determine whether it benefits or not from time-varying actuator scheduling, and quantify the sub-optimality gap of time-invariant policies.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{continuously}} harvest citrus fruit using on-going harvesting machines such as canopy shakers, the catching system should catch and collect fruits continuously. In this thesis, three concepts were explored for a catching system {{appropriate for the}} canopy harvesting system. The first concept is a brush catching concept applied to low profile catching systems. Strip brush brooms were mounted {{at the end of}} collecting beds to make seals around tree trunk and along the narrow space between trees. The strip brush brooms used in this project were originally manufactured for street sweeping vehicles. Each brush could tilt from 30 degrees up to 45 degrees using an electrical linear actuator. The second concept is to adjust catching unit to an irregular tree row using tree position measured by range sensor. Brush catching units are moved laterally using actuators controlled by the programmable logic controller (PLC). As the tree approaches the front of catching system, its distance is measured by range sensor. An output signal from range sensor is filtered and modulated as continuous step signal. Based on this data, brush catching units can move to accommodate tree misalignment within the row. The last concept is a kind of selective catching concept. This concept was not fully completed in this project. It required two procedures to execute; 1) skip catching mode using actuators; and 2) identifying sensing for immature or diseased trees. The first required procedure could be solved by making enough space between brush catching units for the rejected tree to pass through without catching fruits. <b>Actuating</b> <b>times</b> for skipping mode were studied and preset to PLC. Otherwise, the maturity of trees can be determined using a DGPS based tree fruit harvest selection map. A timer-based method was used to order the trees for selective rejection of immature trees in this study. The efficiency of this catching system was measured in terms of collecting rate and skipping rate under the simulated catching environment. Mean percentage in catching tennis balls (substituted for fruits) was reported as 98. 55 %, while the effectiveness for skipping immature fruits was 68 %...|$|R

Its performance is even worse than TUC in all but demand scenario 2, where actuation indicates some, though very small, improvement.|$|R

The Smart-inhaler {{is a relatively}} new device that has not been previously validated. This study examines the accuracy of the Smart-inhaler in a bench-top experiment and compares it with a previously validated device, the Doser. Ten Smart-inhalers and five Dosers were actuated twice on two occasions per day for 30 days (120 doses). Six Smart-inhalers were also <b>actuated</b> 30 <b>times</b> in rapid succession to examine the ability of the Smart-inhaler to detect "dumping". Five Smart-inhalers failed to detect the first one or two doses. However, when the aerosol canister was placed more firmly in the device, actuating the device in the process, the following two doses were recorded accurately in all ten devices. Otherwise all ten Smart-inhalers and five Dosers recorded all actuations faithfully and there were no spurious recordings. The six Smart-inhalers recorded all 30 doses delivered in rapid succession. The Smart-inhaler and Doser are both highly accurate at measuring actuated doses and no spurious doses were recorded in an in vitro setting...|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s & 80s, {{dot matrix}} {{printers}} {{were one of}} the more common types of printers used for general use, such as for home and small office use. Such printers normally had either 9 or 24 pins on the print head (early 7 pin printers also existed, which did not print descenders). There was a period during the early home computer era when a range of printers were manufactured under many brands such as the Commodore VIC-1525 using the Seikosha Uni-Hammer system. This used a single solenoid with an oblique striker that would be <b>actuated</b> 7 <b>times</b> for each column of 7 vertical pixels while the head was moving at a constant speed. The angle of the striker would align the dots vertically even though the head had moved one dot spacing in the time. The vertical dot position was controlled by a synchronised longitudinally ribbed platen behind the paper that rotated rapidly with a rib moving vertically seven dot spacings in the time it took to print one pixel column. 24-pin print heads were able to print at a higher quality and started to offer additional type styles and were marketed as Near Letter Quality by some vendors. Once the price of inkjet printers dropped {{to the point where they}} were competitive with dot matrix printers, dot matrix printers began to fall out of favour for general use.|$|R

This is equivalent to assuming the mirror is operated in vacuum or at ambient pressure.

40|$|AbstractActuated {{traffic signals}} usually use loop detectors. The current {{practice}} {{in many cities}} is to install four consecutive loop detectors in each lane to reduce the chance of undetected vehicles. Due to practical reasons, all four loop detectors in each lane and other detectors referring to the same phase are spliced together. Thus, {{it is possible for}} several vehicles to be counted as one single car. This way of detector wiring to the cabinet reduces the accuracy of detectors for collecting traffic volumes. Our preliminary studies show cases with an error greater than 75 percent. Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to provide a simple method to obtain turning volumes from signal information in actuated non-coordinated traffic signals without using loop detector data. To produce the required data, a simulation was performed in VISSIM with different input volumes. To change turning volumes, a code was developed in COM interface. With this code, the inputs did not have to be changed manually. In addition, the COM code stored the outputs. Data were then exported to a single Excel file. Afterwards, regression and the adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were used to build models to obtain turning volumes. The accuracy of models is defined in terms of mean absolute percent error (MAPE). Results of our two case studies show that during peak hours, there is a high correlation between <b>actuated</b> green <b>time</b> and volumes.

Reed switches were formerly used in the keyboards for computer terminals, where each key had a magnet and a reed switch actuated by depressing the key; cheaper switches are now used. Electric and electronic pedal keyboards used by pipe organ and Hammond organ players often use reed switches, where the glass enclosure of the contacts protects them from dirt, dust, and other particles.

40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} {{are the leading}} causes of death around the world. Point-of-care devices using nucleic acid amplification are sensitive enough to diagnose these diseases, however, often require complex and time-intensive sample preparation steps that are not integrated with the detection process. A rapid, sensitive, and integrated sample-to-result diagnostic device will permit disease treatment planning at the point-of-care. Paper-based detection assays are a promising platform to integrate the sample preparation and detection, with minimal infrastructure, equipment, and user involvement. To integrate sample preparation with detection on paper-based assays, timing and delivery of sample fluid flow needs to be controlled. Here we use thermally responsive materials (e. g. wax) to create a micro valve on a nitrocellulose membrane in order to automate fluid flow and minimize user involvement. The ease-of-fabrication, lot-to-lot variability and consistency of the dispensing methods are compared. After multiple trials, dispensing the wax material, PureTemp 68 X, using a stamp made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is able to direct the sample flow with the highest consistency. Thermally responsive valves fabricated by stamping PureTemp 68 X are found to block the sample fluid to flow for a sustained time when cool. When heated above the melting temperature (68 °C), the valve opens and allows fluid flow without interfering with downstream assay binding reactions. These valves can be <b>actuated</b> multiple <b>times</b> simply by heating and cooling again. As a proof of concept, we use the valve to control sample delivery time of nucleic acid amplicons in a lateral flow immunoassay. Amplicons dispensed onto {{one side of the}} assay are incubated and bind to gold nanoparticles. They are then released through the valve by applying heat to open the valve. Nanoparticle nucleic acid amplicons will bind to recognition antibodies at {{the far side of the}} valve and become visible bands for detection...|$|R

To prevent the compartment fire, a sprinkler for first-aid fire-fighting is installed in rooms. However, {{it is difficult to}} determine the degree to which smoke generation and the fire spreading will be inhibited when sprinklers are on. In particular, demonstrating evacuation behavior assuming an actual fire is impossible. In this study, we evaluated an effectiveness of the sprinkler by numerical simulations. To consider evacuation dynamics, a real-coded cellular automata (RCA) was used, where we can freely set the direction and velocity of an evacuee based on a floor field model. To consider the situation in the room fire, we used a simulator called Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). Two cases with and without the sprinkler were compared to see the validity of the sprinkler on evacuation dynamics. The effect of smoke and the expansion of the fire-spreading region were discussed. Results show that, since the fire-spreading region disappears when the sprinkler is <b>actuated,</b> the evacuation <b>time</b> decreases. Even though the sprinkler is actuated, the smoke generated at the beginning of a fire diffuses inside the whole room. However, the duration of evacuees being overwhelmed by smoke is less, because the amount of smoke generated by the pyrolysis reaction is much decreased...|$|R

The spatial arrangement of the cilia can be varied by altering the layout of the micro pillars on the roll surface. In addition, the final geometry of the individual cilia depends on the rheological properties of the precursor material in combination with the processing parameters of the roll-pulling process. A rheological study and fabrication tests were carried out for a range of precursor material compositions to obtain insight into the relation between precursor rheology and processing conditions on the one hand, and cilia geometry on the other hand.

40|$|Traffic signals {{as part of}} {{intelligent}} transportation systems can {{play a significant role}} toward making cities smart. Conventionally, most traffic lights are designed with fixed-time control, which induces a lot of slack time (unused green <b>time).</b> <b>Actuated</b> traffic lights control traffic flow in real time and are more responsive to the variation of traffic demands. For an isolated signal, a family of time series models such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models can be beneficial for predicting the next cycle length. However, when there are multiple signals placed along a corridor with different spacing and configurations, the cycle length variation of such signals is not just related to each signal's values, but it is also affected by the platoon of vehicles coming from neighboring intersections. In this paper, a multivariate time series model is developed to analyze the behavior of signal cycle lengths of multiple intersections placed along a corridor in a fully actuated setup. Five signalized intersections have been modeled along a corridor, with different spacing among them, together with multiple levels of traffic demand. To tackle the high-dimensional nature of the problem, penalized least squares method are utilized in the estimation procedure to output sparse models. Two proposed sparse time series methods captured the signal data reasonably well, and outperformed the conventional vector autoregressive (VAR) model - in some cases up to 17 % - as well as being more powerful than univariate models such as ARIMA...|$|R
40|$|The zero-pressure {{gradient}} turbulent {{boundary layer}} at Reynolds numbers (based on momentum thickness) ranging from 2700 [...] 4100 was perturbed using an impulsively short patch of two-dimensional, spanwise roughness elements. A spatial perturbation was considered in which the roughness patch was held statically on the flat-plate, and the flow downstream of the perturbation was measured by hotwire and particle-image velocimetry. A dynamic perturbation, in which the roughness patch was <b>actuated</b> periodically in <b>time,</b> was also studied, and additional measurements were taken by phase-locking to the dynamic actuation itself. The static perturbation distorted the boundary layer through the generation of a `stress bore' which modified the mean streamwise velocity gradient. The effect of this stress bore was observed in a modification of statistical and spectral measures of the turbulence, {{as well as a}} redistribution of coherent structures in the boundary layer. The characterization of the statically perturbed boundary layer provided a base flow from which to consider the dynamically perturbed flow. The dynamically perturbed flow manifested both effects analogous to the static perturbation, as well as a coherent, periodic, large-scale velocity fluctuation. The extent to which these two features could be treated as linearly independent was studied by a variety of statistical and spectral means. Moreover, the very large scale motion synthesized by the dynamic perturbation was isolated by phase-locked measurement, and its behavior was predicted with reasonable success by employing a resolvent operator approach to a forced version of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation. The relationship between large-scale motions and an envelope of small-scale motions in the {{turbulent boundary layer}} was studied in both the unperturbed and perturbed flows. A variety of correlation techniques were used to interpret the interaction between the different scale motions {{in the context of a}} phase-relationship between large and small scales.

40|$|Driven by {{miniaturization}} and {{the continuing}} increase in clock speed and data transfer, power dissipation in many electronic components has exceeded the limits of conventional cooling methodologies, such as fan-blown air cooling. Given the expected increase in power density, microprocessor designers have identified cooling {{as one of the}} major challenges for the next decade. Similar needs arise from the further development of other electronic devices such as Light Emitting Diodes (LED), where future generations of high light-output multichip LED modules are being developed for general and automotive illumination applications as well as for power electronics. Hence, there is a tremendous need for innovative cooling technologies. One of the most important factors in reducing the lifetime of micro-electronic components is the high operation temperature and thermal cycling. Liquid cooling has been identified {{as one of the most}} promising solutions in reducing the operation temperature of high power electronics. Liquid cooling is often not optimized, leading to excess of cooling and large temperature variations over the IC. If the coolant is allowed to boil in the cooling channels, the heat transfer coefficient is increased with one order of magnitude. The problem of phase transition regime is the boiling instability. A solution of these problems is addressed by implementation of valves in the cooling system. For single-phase systems they have the role of maintaining a more uniform temperature over the IC and to reduce the pumping power. For two-phase systems the valve purpose is to maintain the most optimum boiling conditions. A comparative study of different actuation principles was performed to identify the best actuation technology applied for chip cooling valves which meet the cooling requirements targeted in this PhD project. This classifies the valve size between the micro and macro-scale, a field which has been mainly overlooked by prior research and potentially promising applications have not been yet explored. It is for the first time that valves are especially designed for chip cooling applications. The principal requirements for the mechanical valves are the following: no leakage to the environment, low power consumption, continuous and proportional flow control, low cost, fast response time, small size and high reliability. The most promising actuation technology found for single-phase flow is thermopneumatic actuation. Based on this principle, a valve has been designed manufactured and tested on a cooling system. The valve actuation is performed by the thermal expansion of a liquid (actuation fluid) which, at the same <b>time,</b> <b>actuates</b> the valve and provides feed-back sensing. The thermopneumatic valve shows a novel actuation principle that combines the advantages of zero power consumption, small size compared with the high flow rate, and low manufacturing costs. This valve has the major advantage that it can be used together with any heat sink used for microelectronic cooling. Its small size and its independence from external energy make it suited for portable devices. No electrical connection, no wires and no electronic control are needed, increasing its simplicity and reliability. A maximum flow rate of 38 kg/h passes through the valve for a heat load up to 133 W. The valve is able to reduce the pumping power by up to 60 % and has the capability to reduce the temperature variation over the IC with up to 24 %. The most suitable actuation principle found for two-phase cooling is electro- magnetic actuation for large bandwidth, large forces, relatively high strokes and low manufacturing cost. The electromagnetic valve uses the reluctance actuation principle. It makes use of a pilot valve to reduce the size and the required actuation force. The emphasis is placed on a compact planar design to fit in planar devices. A pressure balance design allows operation at high system pressures. Because the pressure balance is used to drive the valve, an analytical and numerical model has been developed to predict the pressure distribution over the valve. The pilot valve has also been modelled as well and linearised using the results obtained from the model. The results of the model have been successfully validated by measurements. The valve is capable to control a flow rate up to 15 kg/h. This flow rate is sufficient to remove a heat input of 133 W equivalent with a heat flux of 500 W/cm 2 at a temperature difference of 20 deg. C. Its equilibrated design allows a pressure drop control of up to 100 kPa at maximum system pressures of 600 kPa. Compared with the latest research published in literature and the latest developments in industry, this electromagnetic valve classifies on top of the list when it comes to the following combined properties in a single package: high speed proportional control, compact dimensions, high flow rates at low pressure drop, high reliability and low manufacturing cost. This research demonstrates the need for valves and the benefits of using valves in high performance cooling systems.
