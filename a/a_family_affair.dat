Niedermayer and the Devils reached their fourth Stanley Cup Final in 2002–03. The series was <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>affair,</b> as Scott's brother Rob {{was a member of}} the {{opposing}} Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. When asked, their mother admitted she was hoping Rob's Mighty Ducks would win as Scott already had two championships to his name. Scott dashed his brother and mother's hopes, recording two assists in the deciding seventh game to lead the Devils to a 3–0 victory, and win his third Stanley Cup.|$|E

500|$|A santon (Provençal: [...] "little saint") {{is a small}} hand-painted, {{terracotta}} nativity scene figurine {{produced in}} the Provence region of southeastern France. In a traditional Provençal crèche, the santons represent various characters from Provençal village life such as the scissors grinder, the fishwife, and the chestnut seller. The figurines were first created during the French Revolution when churches were forcibly closed and large nativity scenes prohibited. Today, their production is <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>affair</b> passed from parents to children. During the Christmas season, santon makers gather in Marseille and other locales in southeastern France to display and sell their wares.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{attempts}} to broaden their appeal, {{the issue of}} foreigners remained central to the party's rhetoric. Janmaat was convicted of [...] "inciting racial hatred" [...] by the Dutch courts for speaking out against multiculturalism. His conviction later {{came to be seen}} as unwarranted by mainstream observers. Janmaat and Schuurman, who were to marry in 1996, dominated the party. With Schuurman's son head of the party office, the Centre Democrats became almost <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>affair.</b> Janmaat remained skeptical of initiatives outside his own control, and expelled multiple local council members from the party. While much of this was due to local cooperationunauthorized by the Centre Democrats leadershipwith the more radical Centre Party '86 (CP'86), Janmaat later agreed to coordinate joint demonstrations with it. The cooperation soon fell apart and Janmaat distanced himself from CP'86 as the 1998 election approached.|$|E
500|$|Rescued by Rover was {{predominantly}} <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>affair</b> – Cecil Hepworth's wife, Margaret, {{wrote the}} scenario {{and played the}} role of the mother on screen. Hepworth himself directed, painted the scenery and acted as the father. Their child was the baby on screen, and the part of Rover was played by the family dog, Blair. Two professional actors were paid to appear, Sebastian Smith as the soldier, and his wife as the old woman who stole the baby. The two actors were paid half a guinea each; Hepworth would recall [...] "We couldn't get them for less". The film is often cited as the first film to have used paid actors. Completing the cast was Mabel Clark, who had previously played Alice in Hepworth's version of Alice in Wonderland, as the child's nurse. Clark was also the cutting room assistant.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the success}} of Departures at the Academy Awards, critic Saburō Kawamoto found the film to show a Japan that the Japanese could relate to, in that, in a nation whose customs put great weight on visits to ancestral graves, a death was always <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>affair.</b> [...] He {{believed}} the film had a samurai beauty to it, with its many scenes of families sitting seiza. Critic [...] gave the film a 90% rating, and credited the performances of the two leads {{for much of the}} film's success. [...] He praised its emotional impact and its balance of seriousness and humour, but was more critical of the father–son relationship, which he considered overdone. [...] Maeda attributed the film's international success, despite its heavily Japanese content, to its clear depiction of Japanese views on life and death. He found the film's conceptual scale to have an affinity to that of Hollywood (something he considered lacking in most Japanese films).|$|E

Newspapers across the United States republished the stories from the San Francisco papers and looked for local angles. On December 14, 1896, the San Francisco Call quoted a story from the New York Journal by Alfred H. Lewis, [...] "who knew the 'bad men' in Arizona. He said that the Earps in Tombstone were [...] "stage robbers" [...] who [...] "stood up stages and plundered express companies for a livelihood... The Earps, Wyatt, Virgil, Warren and Julian, had treated themselves to many a killing... Warren Earp, who was a stage-company guard, meekly put his hands over his head... it was from all standpoints <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>affair</b> {{on the part of the}} Earps.

2500|$|The charismatic and {{controversial}} Pankhursts formed the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1903. As Emmline Pankhurst put it, they viewed votes for women {{no longer as}} [...] "a right, but as a desperate necessity". At the state level, Australia and the United States had already granted suffrage to some women. American feminists such as Susan B. Anthony (1902) visited Britain. While WSPU was the best-known suffrage group, it {{was only one of}} many, such as the Women's Freedom League and the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) led by Millicent Garrett Fawcett. WSPU was largely <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>affair,</b> although externally financed.

Gifford studied as a postgraduate at the French National School of Forestry, in Nancy, for a year. He returned home and plunged into the nascent forestry movement, intent on shaping a national forest policy. At Gifford's urging, together James and Gifford endowed the Yale School of Forestry in 1900, and James turned Grey Towers, the family estate at Milford, Pennsylvania, into a [...] "nursery" [...] for the American forestry movement. Family financial affairs were managed by brother Amos Pinchot, thus freeing Gifford to do the more important work of developing forest management concepts. Unlike some others in the forestry movement, Gifford's wealth allowed him to singly pursue this goal without worry of income.|$|E

Directed by Shaad Ali, the film was produced by Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra under the Yash Raj Films banner.

Taran Adarsh of IndiaFM.com gave the film a 1.5 out of 5 rating, saying, [...] "the film is all gloss, no substance". He also believed that Deol was overshadowed by his co-stars, remarking that the film, [...] "belongs to Abhishek first and Preity next". Deol next starred in the boxing drama Apne. The film was <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>affair,</b> featuring Bobby Deol alongside his father Dharmendra, a disgraced retired boxer who trains Bobby and his brother (Sunny Deol) to become champion boxers but in doing so creates a rift within the family.
