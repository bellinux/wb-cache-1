5|$|James B. Conant, the {{chairman}} of the NDRC and the S-1 Executive Committee, was concerned that the navy was running its own nuclear project, but Bush felt that it did no harm. He met with Gunn at Anacostia on 14 January 1943, and explained the situation to him. Gunn responded that the navy was interested in nuclear marine propulsion for nuclear submarines. Liquid thermal diffusion was a viable means of producing enriched uranium, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> needed was details about nuclear reactor design, which he knew was being pursued by the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. He was unaware that the it had already built Chicago Pile-1, a working nuclear reactor. Bush was unwilling to provide the requested data, but arranged with Rear Admiral William R. Purnell, a fellow member of the Military Policy Committee that ran the Manhattan Project, for Abelson's efforts to receive additional support.|$|E
5|$|Naoi {{is a human}} {{originally}} {{thought to be a}} non-player character (non-human). After he died, Naoi developed hypnotic powers that allow him to control others and cause them to enter a dream-like state. In life, {{he was the son of}} a famous potter. However, it was his twin brother who had the talent in pottery and as a result, Naoi was ignored by everyone. When his brother died, he was made to replace him by his father and was given strict training in pottery. As a result, he felt as if his own life was fake <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> wanted was to be acknowledged for his own existence. He later befriends Otonashi after he acknowledges him and joins the SSS. As acting student council president for a time and self-proclaimed God, Naoi is strict and arrogant, but this is quick to disperse when Otonashi chastises him. He is affectionate to Otonashi, much to the latter's chagrin, and always tries to earn his affection. He uses dual USP 45 handguns.|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} the {{pictures}} led Dean to offer Formby a seven-year contract with ATP, {{which resulted in the}} production of 11 films, although Dean's fellow producer, Michael Balcon, considered Formby to be [...] "an odd and not particularly loveable character". The first film from the deal was released in 1935. No Limit features Formby as an entrant in the Isle of Man annual Tourist Trophy (TT) motorcycle race. Monty Banks directed, and Florence Desmond took the female lead. According to Richards, Dean did not try [...] "to play down Formby's Lancashire character" [...] for the film, and employed Walter Greenwood, the Salford-born author of the 1933 novel Love on the Dole, as the scriptwriter. Filming was troubled, with Beryl being difficult to everyone present. The writer Matthew Sweet describes the set as [...] "a battleground" [...] because of her actions, and Banks unsuccessfully requested that Dean bar Beryl from the studio. The Observer thought that parts of No Limit were [...] "pretty dull stuff", but the race footage was [...] "shot and cut to a maximum of excitement". Regarding the star of the film, the reviewer thought that [...] "our Lancashire George is a grand lad; he can gag and clown, play the banjo and sing with authority... Still <b>and</b> <b>all,</b> <b>he</b> doesn't do too bad." [...] The film was so popular it was reissued in 1938, 1946 and 1957.|$|E

Lawrence added that he also included some details in the video, including a reference to Spears's tattoo, which Timberlake enjoyed. He explained that he and Timberlake did not mention names while creating the video, only discussing the song's general beats. Lawrence also revealed that executives of Jive Records were nervous about some aspects of the video, such as Timberlake's representation of a voyeur and the tone of some scenes he was portraying with a girl. [...] "That's the thing I liked most about this project, was that he was coming into it with a super clean-cut image with 'N Sync and he's such a nice guy and so handsome and what I was into doing was making him be a bit scary. Lurking around the house in the rain, throwing a rock through her window, being a peeping Tom, getting revenge and doing stuff that's not really what a nice guy does." [...] The music video for [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] was released onto the iTunes Store on April 28, 2003.|$|E
500|$|Homer {{attempts}} to appease Grimes by inviting {{him to his}} home for a lobster dinner {{in order to make}} him and his enemy co-worker friends. Grimes' visit to the Simpson house only fuels his resentment; he is incensed by Homer's ability to live such a comfortable life and earn so many accomplishments (such as being friends with former president Gerald Ford, going on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins, going into space, and winning a Grammy) despite his slothful and ignorant ways, while Grimes has to live a life of hard work <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> has to show for it is a battered briefcase, a bad haircut, and a single room apartment between two bowling alleys. Declaring Homer a [...] "fraud", a bitter Grimes storms away in anger. The following day, Homer, after getting advice from Marge, makes further {{attempts to}} earn Grimes' respect by acting as a model employee, but his efforts fail. Grimes rants about Homer to Lenny and Carl, both of whom insist that despite his faults, Homer is essentially a decent person. To prove Homer's lack of intelligence, he tricks Homer into entering a nuclear power plant design contest intended for children, by carefully cutting away all references to them in a promotional poster which he leaves at Homer's control panel. Homer, unaware that the contest is only open to kids, eagerly takes on the challenge to prove his professionalism. At the contest, Grimes is horrified when Homer's model, which is almost exactly the same as the current power plant with only a few modifications, easily wins against Ralph Wiggum's Malibu Stacy dream house, and Martin Prince's futuristic model that supplies power to the room. The audience's applause and cheers for Homer cause Grimes to finally snap and he runs amok through the plant, mimicking and mocking Homer's habits. Entering Homer's office, Grimes sees a machine labeled [...] "Extremely High Voltage", sarcastically declares that he does not need safety gloves because he's Homer Simpson, grabs the high voltage wires and is fatally electrocuted. At Grimes' funeral (with a headstone that simply reads [...] "Grimes"), Homer unintentionally and unknowingly gets the last laugh as he falls asleep and in a drowsy state tells Marge to change the TV channel, causing all the attendees to burst into laughter and completely ignore Grimes' coffin as it's lowered into the earth.|$|E

[...] His mother responded, [...] "You won't! You can't! You mustn't!"

2500|$|Palafox laid formal {{complaints}} against Jesuits at Rome. The pope, however, refused to approve his censures, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> could obtain {{was a brief}} from Pope Innocent X (on May 14, 1648), commanding the Jesuits to respect the episcopal jurisdiction. On May 20, 1655, Palafox and the Jesuits signed an accord, but disagreements continued. In the same year the Jesuits succeeded in securing his transfer to the little see of Osma in Old Castile. [...] Although Palafox's ecclesiastical career went into eclipse, his writings against the Jesuits were subsequently published in France and in the eighteenth century, his writings were used to strengthen the case for regalist authority resulting in the expulsion of the Jesuits from Spain and Spanish territories in 1767.|$|E
2500|$|Legend {{says that}} {{one day after the}} war was over, Ashoka ventured out to roam the city <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> could see were burnt houses and {{scattered}} corpses. The lethal war with Kalinga transformed the vengeful Emperor Ashoka to a stable and peaceful emperor and he became a patron of Buddhism. According to the prominent Indologist, A. L. Basham, Ashoka's personal religion became Buddhism, if not before, then certainly after the Kalinga war. However, according to Basham, the Dharma officially propagated by Ashoka was not Buddhism at all. Nevertheless, his patronage led to the expansion of Buddhism in the Mauryan empire and other kingdoms during his rule, and worldwide from about 250 BCE. Prominent in this cause were his son Mahinda (Mahendra) and daughter Sanghamitra (whose name means [...] "friend of the Sangha"), who established Buddhism in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka).|$|E

I just thought that Elvis had {{all the money in the}} world, all the Cadillacs and all the girls, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> did was play the guitar and sing. That made a big impression on me." [...] In 1958 the family moved to Boulder, Colorado. Van Zandt would remember his time in Colorado fondly and would often visit it as an adult. He would later refer to Colorado in [...] "My Proud Mountains", [...] "Colorado Girl", and [...] "Snowin' On Raton". Townes was a good student and active in team sports. In grade school, he received a high IQ score and his parents began grooming him to become a lawyer or senator. Fearing that his family would move again, he willingly decided to attend the Shattuck School, Faribault, Minnesota. He received a score of 1170 when he took the SAT in January 1962. His family soon moved to Houston, Texas.|$|E
