25|$|SL-1 was {{constructed}} with a main central control rod that {{was capable of}} producing a very large excess reactivity if it were completely removed. The extra rod worth was {{in part due to}} the decision to load only 40 of the 59 fuel assemblies with nuclear fuel, thus making the prototype reactor core more active in the center. In normal operation control rods are withdrawn only enough to cause sufficient reactivity for a sustained nuclear reaction and power generation. In this accident, however, the reactivity addition was sufficient to take the reactor prompt critical within a time estimated at 3.6 milliseconds.

40|$|The United States Department of Energy (DOE) {{currently}} owns {{several hundred}} {{metric tons of}} <b>aluminum</b> <b>clad,</b> spent nuclear fuel and target assemblies. The vast majority of these irradiated assemblies are currently stored in water basins that were designed and operated for short term fuel cooling prior to fuel reprocessing. Recent DOE decisions to severely limit the reprocessing option have significantly lengthened the time of storage, thus increasing the tendency for corrosion induced degradation of the fuel cladding and the underlying core material. The portent of continued corrosion, coupled with the age of existing wet storage facilities {{and the cost of}} continuing basin operations, including necessary upgrades to meet current facility standards, may force the DOE to transition these wet stored, <b>aluminum</b> <b>clad</b> spent fuels to interim dry storage. The facilities for interim dry storage have not been developed, partially because fuel storage requirements and specifications for acceptable fuel forms are lacking. In spite of the lack of both facilities and specifications, current plans are to dry store fuels for approximately 40 to 60 years or until firm decisions are developed for final fuel disposition. The transition of the <b>aluminum</b> <b>clad</b> fuels from wet to interim dry storage will require a sequence of drying and canning operations which will include selected fuel preparations such as vacuum drying and conditioning of the storage atmosphere. Laboratory experiments and review of the available literature have demonstrated that successful interim dry storage may also require the use of fuel and canister cleaning or rinsing techniques that preclude, or at least minimize, the potential for the accumulation of chloride and other potentially deleterious ions in the dry storage environment. This paper summarizes an evaluation of the impact of fuel transitioning techniques on the potential for corrosion induced degradation of fuel forms during interim dry storage...|$|R

During {{the first phase of}} the experimental program, materials from three different color coded fuel rods were dissolved in caustic and nitric acid solutions. The final phase of the laboratory program involved the dissolution and characterization of materials from three cracked pellet fuel rods using a selected caustic/ nitric acid flowsheet. Laboratory results obtained from the initial dissolution studies identified several inconsistencies and potential problem issues with the behavior of materials from the color coded fuel rods. Based on these findings and influenced by the difficulties introduced by using the RCRA listed mercury during processing, the flowsheet selected for dissolving these <b>aluminum</b> <b>clad</b> fuel rods in F-Canyon dissolvers was the two- step caustic decladding/ nitric acid dissolution flowsheet. The final phase of the experimental program involved testing materials from three cracked pellet fuel rods using the selected flowsheet.

However, some uranium and plutonium bearing solids remained with the caustic decladding solution which could be sent to waste. The quantities of uranium and plutonium expected to remain with the caustic solutions are small. Fluoride ions will need to be present in the nitric acid dissolver solution to dissolve all solids.

Since the middles of the 60 ’s decade the General Atomics, supplier of the TRIGA reactor, discontinued the fabrication of such <b>aluminum</b> <b>clad</b> fuel elements.
