5|$|The {{concept of}} file {{encrypting}} ransomware was invented and implemented by Young and Yung at Columbia University and {{was presented at}} the 1996 IEEE Security & Privacy conference. It is called cryptoviral extortion and it was inspired by the fictional facehugger in the movie Alien. Cryptoviral extortion is the following three-round protocol carried out between the attacker <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b>|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} reasons for fighting, the {{foremost}} is retaliation. When players engage in play {{that members of the}} opposing team consider unscrupulous, a fight can ensue. The fight may be between the assailant <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim,</b> between the assailant and an enforcer from the victim's team, or between opposing enforcers. Fights that occur for retaliation purposes can be in immediate response to an on-ice incident, to incidents from earlier in the game, or to actions from past games. Enforcers who intend to start a fight have to consider their timing due to the Instigator rule. For example, putting the opposing team on a power play due to penalties incurred from fighting is less advisable when the game is close.|$|E

5|$|Payment is {{virtually}} always the goal, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> is coerced into {{paying for the}} ransomware to be removed—which {{may or may not}} actually occur—either by supplying a program that can decrypt the files, or by sending an unlock code that undoes the payload's changes. A key element in making ransomware work for the attacker is a convenient payment system that is hard to trace. A range of such payment methods have been used, including wire transfers, premium-rate text messages, pre-paid voucher services such as Paysafecard, and the digital currency Bitcoin. A 2016 survey commissioned by Citrix claimed that larger businesses are holding bitcoin as contingency plans.|$|E
5|$|On 30 May 2010—the fifth {{anniversary of}} Holloway's disappearance—Stephany Tatiana Flores Ramírez, 21, {{died at the}} Hotel TAC, in the Miraflores District of Lima, Peru. On 2 June, a hotel {{employee}} found her beaten body in Room 309, which had been registered in Van der Sloot's name. He had departed from the hotel without returning the room key and left the television running. A tennis racquet, identified by the coroner as a possible homicide weapon, was recovered from the room. A hotel guest and an employee came forward to say they saw Van der Sloot <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> entering the hotel room together, and the police obtained video of the two playing cards {{at the same table}} the night before at the Atlantic City Casino in Lima.

25|$|One {{night while}} working the late shift, he killed a man. Authorities briefly arrested him, but Quantrill {{claimed that he}} had acted in self-defense.

Quantrill journeyed back home to Canal Dover that fall, with no more money in his pockets than when he had left.|$|E

A buckle on the belt was made of brass <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> wore two metal rings; one white, and one yellow in color. The yellow ring contained a red stone and the white ring bore Native American designs and was created in Mexico.|$|E

25|$|Usually {{the chair}} was {{fastened}} to a long wooden beam fixed as a seesaw {{on the edge of}} a pond or river. Sometimes, however, the ducking-stool was not a fixture but was mounted on a pair of wooden wheels so that it could be wheeled through the streets, and at the river-edge was hung by a chain from the end of a beam. In sentencing a woman the magistrates ordered the number of duckings she should have. Yet another type of ducking-stool was called a tumbrel. It was a chair on two wheels with two long shafts fixed to the axles. This was pushed into the pond and then the shafts released, thus tipping the chair up backwards. Sometimes the punishment proved fatal <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> died.|$|E
25|$|Yet law was {{not simply}} a matter of codes and procedures. Law was {{understood}} to reflect the moral universe, and a criminal or civil offense would throw that universe out of balance in a way that only just punishment could restore. The official Five Punishments (wu xing) prescribed under the Qing Code included beating with the light bamboo, beating with the heavy bamboo, penal servitude, exile, and execution. In calibrating punishment, the magistrate had to take into account not only the nature of the offense but the relation between the guilty party <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b> An offense by a son against a father was far more serious than one by a father against a son, likewise an offense by a wife or other member of the family.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, both Japanese {{military}} personnel, {{especially the}} Kempeitai, {{and the officers}} of the Gestapo, the German secret police, used waterboarding {{as a method of}} torture. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore, the Double Tenth Incident occurred. This included waterboarding, by the method of binding or holding down the victim on his back, placing a cloth over his mouth and nose, and pouring water onto the cloth. In this version, interrogation continued during the torture, with the interrogators beating the victim if he did not reply <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> swallowing water if he opened his mouth to answer or breathe. When the victim could ingest no more water, the interrogators would beat or jump on his distended stomach.|$|E

25|$|Excited utterances: Statements {{relating}} to startling events or condition made while the declarant {{was under the}} stress of excitement caused by the event or condition. This is the exception that may apply to the 'police officer' scenario listed above. The victim's cries of help were made under the stress of a startling event, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> is still under {{the stress of the}} event, as is evidenced by the victim's crying and visible shaking. An excited utterance {{does not have to be}} made at the same time of the startling event. A statement made minutes, hours or even days after the startling event can be excited utterances, so long as the declarant is still under the stress of the startling event. However, the more time that elapses between a startling event and the declarant's statement, the more the statements will be looked upon with disfavor.|$|E
25|$|While the Code of Hammurabi {{was trying}} to achieve equality, biases still existed towards those {{categorized}} in {{the lower end of}} the social spectrum and some of the punishments and justice could be gruesome. The magnitude of criminal penalties often was based on the identity and gender of both the person committing the crime <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b> The Code issues justice following the three classes of Babylonian society: property owners, freed men, and slaves. Punishments for someone assaulting someone from a lower class were far lighter than if they had assaulted someone of equal or higher status. For example, if a doctor killed a rich patient, he would have his hands cut off, but if he killed a slave, only financial restitution was required. Women could also receive punishments that their male counterparts would not, as men were permitted to have affairs with their servants and slaves, whereas married women would be harshly punished for committing adultery.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, a 51-year-old police constable {{attracted}} a 16-year-old girl {{to his house}} by showing her his badge, where he got her drunk and raped her twice. The constable was fired and sentenced to a two-year suspended sentence. In 2007, an Iranian-born immigrant, Rasoul Pourak, was beaten in a cell at Pasila Police Station, Helsinki. The ill-treatment caused Pourak bruises all over his body, an open wound over his eyebrow, and a fractured skull. In addition, facial bones were broken <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> was left permanently damaged. One guard participating in the assault was sentenced to an 80-day suspended prison sentence. In 2010, two police officers assaulted {{a man in a}} wheelchair in connection with an arrest. The police twisted the man's hands and pushed him backward causing him to break a femur. In 2013, two policemen were sentenced to 35 day fines for assault and breach of duty in connection with stamping on a man's head onto the asphalt thrice. According to the police, the man of Romani descent resisted, yet according to eyewitnesses, the man did not resist. The event was captured in surveillance video, which was stored but accidentally destroyed according to a third officer present. However the third officer, having seen the surveillance footage, testified that the video didn't show any resistance {{on the part of the}} Romani, but also that the assault happened out of view from the camera.|$|E
