40|$|This book is {{intended}} {{as a basis for}} advanced treatment of concepts in project management. In the current scenario where most questions are answered through the internet, the knowledge element in project management has come under the influence of disruptive technologies. In other words, project managers no longer get 'points' for knowing something that is easily available on the internet. This has far-reaching consequences. The present day project managers need to orient themselves to newer benchmarks of what is required for success on the business front. This book deals with a few such advanced concepts in project management. This book is not designed as an elementary primer to the field of project management, rather it is an <b>advanced</b> <b>level</b> <b>treatment</b> on the subject, to be read after the preliminary study has already been completed. The book is designed for practicing project managers, and graduate students in engineering and management, who need to understand the dynamics that are typically encountered in a project-based environment. The content in the book is based on extensive study of literature and training programs. Many of the tools have been developed on the basis of modeling and simulation methods that are specially designed by the author. These were tested at several live projects across the globe. Most of the exercises in the book are actually meant for the reader to perform as they go. The book is not designed with a ‘read-all-and-come-back-later’ approach, rather it focuses on ‘learning by doing’, whereby the reader is expected to do the exercises before reading on. The book will prove useful in self-learning, as well as in classroom teaching and professional training programs...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between collateral therapy and the adult male pedophile 2 ̆ 7 s ability to <b>advance</b> through <b>levels</b> of <b>treatment.</b> Data from a convenience sample of 27 adult male pedophiles attending therapy at Intermountain Specialized Abuse Treatment Centers were collected for this study. Data were collected from participants 2 ̆ 7 files on 22 independent variables, including the primary independent variable, collateral sessions. The dependent variable was the time it took participants to <b>advance</b> through <b>levels</b> of <b>treatment.</b> A comparison of measures of central tendency for participants who had and those who had not participated in collateral therapy indicated a moderate difference in the number of days it took to complete a level when the sample was divided into collateral versus non- collateral participants. Though no t statistically significant, results of a correlational analysis revealed an inverse relationship between collateral sessions and time. Results of tests run to examine the difference in group means between those who had collateral therapy and those who did not indicated no significant difference in group means. However, a difference approaching significance was found in the advancement from Level II to Level III. Those who participated in collateral therapy appear to have finished Level II sooner than those who had no collateral therapy...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{research}} suggests that adolescent offenders often do not view their criminal behaviors as problematic and, therefore, are not motivated for treatment. Although customarily defined as a static characteristic, the transtheoretical model (TTM) proposes treatment amenability is dynamic and can be achieved through tailored interventions that motivate individuals for treatment. The current study examines the predictive validity of TTM measures for adolescent offenders at a maximum security correctional facility. In particular, the Stages of Change Scale (SOCS) and Decisional Balance for Adolescent Offenders (DBS-AO) were compared with a more traditional assessment tool utilized in evaluating treatment amenability of juvenile offenders (i. e., Risk-Sophistication-Treatment Inventory; RSTI). One hundred adolescent offenders from the Gainesville State School completed two waves of data collection with a 3 -month time interval. Information was collected on offenders' treatment progress between waves. Consistent with TTM research, predictors of treatment progress included low scores on the Cons scale on the DBS-AO and on the Precontemplation scale on the SOCS. Participants in the most <b>advanced</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>treatment</b> also scored high on the Sophistication-Maturity scale on the RSTI and the Impression Management scale on the Paulhus Deception Scale...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} part of a funded {{research}} project that examines possible factors that may influence students' <b>advanced</b> <b>level</b> of knowledge construction. This study examines if group size of the online discussion is related to the frequency of <b>advanced</b> <b>level</b> of knowledge construction occurrences. Group size of an online discussion refers to {{the number of people who}} contributed in the discussion. <b>Advanced</b> <b>levels</b> of knowledge construction refer to levels II, III, IV, or V of Gunawardena, Lowe, and Anderson's (1997) interaction analysis model. Data were collected from 28 asynchronous online discussion forums. Results showed a significant positive correlation between group size and <b>advanced</b> <b>level</b> knowledge construction; suggesting that the larger the group size of the online discussion is, the more frequent the occurrences of <b>advanced</b> <b>level</b> knowledge construction would be. Further analysis between the more successful and less successful forums suggested that a certain critical mass, which appears to be a group size of about 10 participants may be required to direct the discussion to <b>advanced</b> <b>levels</b> of knowledge construction. © 2010 Khe Foon Hew & Wing Sum Cheung. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{advances}} {{in the field of}} science and technology, females are still under-represented in the sciences. The study sought to explore the perceptions of female pupils regarding studying <b>Advanced</b> <b>level</b> sciences in one province in Zimbabwe. The descriptive survey design was employed. One hundred female pupils learning sciences at either Ordinary or <b>Advanced</b> <b>level</b> in ten selected secondary schools in the province participated in the study. Data was collected through questionnaires and focus group discussions. Findings indicate that female pupils have a negative perception towards studying <b>Advanced</b> <b>level</b> sciences and that the low participation of female pupils in <b>Advanced</b> <b>level</b> sciences stem from their lack of confidence in studying subjects that are regarded as masculine in the society. Schools need to implement programmes designed to alter the negative perception of female pupils towards participation in <b>Advanced</b> <b>level</b> sciences and educate them on the benefits derived from studying advanced sciences.
