40|$|To {{solve the}} problem of the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) for the {{underwater}} acoustic communication system, the paper offers a method of reducing PAPR which combines the <b>amplitude</b> <b>limiting</b> and the improved nonlinear transformation. Traditional <b>amplitude</b> <b>limiting</b> technique can reduce PAPR in OFDM system effectively, at the cost of reducing the bit error rate (BER). However the companding transformation has far less computation complexity than SLM or PTS technologies and can improve the BER performance compared to the <b>amplitude</b> <b>limiting</b> technique simultaneously. The paper combines these two kinds of techniques, takes full use of advantages of the two method, and puts forward a low-complexity scheme choosing parameters that are more appropriate to the underwater acoustic field, with the result of improved BER performance even in lower SNR. Both simulation and experiment results show that the new method which combines clipping and companding transformation can effectively reduce the PAPR in the underwater acoustic OFDM communication system and improve the BER performance simultaneously...|$|E

40|$|The {{slope and}} power {{spectral}} density of atmospheric velocity fluctuations versus vertical wavenumber at large wavenumbers are observed to be nearly independent of altitude. It is suggested that such a universality is due to saturation of short vertical-scale fluctuations. A brief review of linear gravity wave saturation theory indicates a physical basis for such spectra. It is demonstrated that observed saturation spectra are not solely due to individually saturated waves but most likely result from <b>amplitude</b> <b>limiting</b> instabilities arising from wave superposition. It is also shown that, while the spectrum is saturated at large wavenumbers, the total kinetic energy per unit mass and the characteristic vertical wavelength increase with altitude. Both of these predictions are consistent with observations...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} and experimentally demonstrate a simple method for phase-preserving amplitude regeneration of constant envelope phase-coded signals. This scheme exploits nonlinear interaction between noisy data and a continuous wave beam {{at a different}} wavelength in a saturated semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA). We show that proper balancing of the input signals' power allows us to exploit the <b>amplitude</b> <b>limiting</b> effect of SOA saturated gain without introducing significant excess phase noise due to suppression of the α-factor in the amplifier. In a 10 -Gb/s nonreturn-to-zero differential phase-shift-keying experiment, both four-wave-mixing (FWM) and pass-through signals are remarkably improved with respect to input data in terms of Q-factor and bit error ratio threshold margin, demonstrating wavelength preserving and wavelength converting regeneration. In particular, the FWM signal exhibits better regenerative performance over {{a broader range of}} degraded input data and for lower input overall power levels...|$|E

40|$|Climate and {{longleaf}} pine (Pinus palustris P. Mill.) radial growth {{relationships have}} been documented within its southern and western distribution. However, knowledge of this relationship is lacking along its northern latitudinal range margin (NLRM). Based {{on the principles of}} ecological <b>amplitude,</b> <b>limiting</b> factors, and studies of coniferous species in eastern temperate forests of the U. S., we hypothesized that the radial growth of longleaf pine in mixed pine-hardwood forests is responding to winter temperatures in southeastern Virginia. Two longleaf pine chronologies were developed to determine the relationship between radial growth and monthly temperature, precipitation, and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) via response function analysis (RFA). Results at the 0. 05 level yielded significant response function coefficients with a positive response to current winter temperature and precipitation and a negative response to prior August PDSI. In studies of climate and longleaf pine radial growth in other parts of its range, winter temperature and precipitation have not shared a significant positive association with radial growth. Instead current spring and summer precipitation usually share this positive association. These findings add more evidence to an emerging pattern suggesting that winter temperatures contribute to limiting the radial growth of temperate conifers at northern range margins in the Northern Hemisphere...|$|E

S. extreme weather using the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and Goddard Earth Observing System Model, version 5, (GEOS- 5) atmospheric general circulation model simulations. The focus is on assessing the impact on precipitation of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, land conditions, and large-scale atmospheric modes of variability. A key {{result is that the}} April record-breaking precipitation in the Ohio River valley was primarily the result of the unforced development of a positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) -like mode of variability with unusually large <b>amplitude,</b> <b>limiting</b> the predictability of the precipitation in that region at 1 -month leads. SST forcing (La Nia conditions) contributed to the broader continental-scale pattern of precipitation anomalies, producing drying in the southern plains and weak wet anomalies in the northeast, while the impact of realistic initial North American land conditions was to enhance precipitation in the upper Midwest and produce deficits in the Southeast. It was further found that 1) the 1 March atmospheric initial condition was the primary source of the ensemble mean precipitation response over the eastern United States in April (well beyond the limit of weather predictability), suggesting an influence on the initial state of the previous SST forcing and/or tropospheric/stratospheric coupling linked to an unusually persistent and cold polar vortex; and 2) stationary wave model experiments suggest that the SST-forced base state for April enhanced the amplitude of the NAO response compared to that of the climatological state, though the impact is modest and can be of either sign...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{evolution of}} an unstable acoustic mode interacting with an ensemble of stable g-modes. We {{show that the}} static multimode solution does not exist. We then find the condition for {{the stability of the}} statistical equilibrium. Performing numerical integration of amplitude equations for a simplified system we find that the acoustic mode amplitude exhibits a large irregular variability on the timescale given by the inverse of the growth rate. The g-mode pairs are excited in significantly wider range of detuning parameters than it is implied by the parametric instability criterion applied to the average amplitude. However, the number of interacting g-mode pairs is reduced because the pairs differing in the detuning parameter by less than their damping rates are synchronized and effectively act as a single pair. We apply the multimode resonant coupling theory to a realistic stellar model. We choose a seismic model of the Delta Scuti star XX Pyxidis. Although for some l= 2 modes we find amplitudes of the order of a few milimagnitudes, the typical amplitudes of low-degree modes are much higher. Taking into account the rotational splitting results in decrease of amplitudes by a factor of few which is not enough to obtain consistency with observations. We conclude that in this star and likely in all evolved Delta Scuti stars, the resonant mode coupling cannot be the dominant <b>amplitude</b> <b>limiting</b> effect. The nonresonant saturation of the driving effect must play the role. Comment: 42 pages, 15 figures, to appear in Acta Astronomic...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND The P 3 {{component}} of the event-related potential (ERP) has been particularly useful in alcohol research for identifying endophenotypes of alcohol use disorder (AUD) risk in sober subjects. However, practice and/or fatigue reduces P 3 <b>amplitude,</b> <b>limiting</b> the ability to ascertain acute and adaptive effects of alcohol exposure. Here, we report acute alcohol effects on P 3 amplitude and latency using an adaptive stop signal task (aSST). METHODS One hundred and forty eight nondependent moderate to heavy social drinkers, age 21 to 27, participated in 2 single-blind, alcohol or placebo, counterbalanced sessions approximately one week apart. During each session, subjects performed an adaptive stop signal task (aSST) at (1) baseline, (2) upon reaching the target 60 mg/dL breath alcohol concentration or at the equivalent time during the placebo session, and (3) approximately 135 minutes later while the breath alcohol concentration was clamped. Here, we report on differences between baseline and first subsequent measurements across the experimental sessions. During each aSST run, the stop signal delay (SSD, the time between stop and go signals) adjusted trial-by-trial based on the subject’s performance. RESULTS The aSST reliably generated a STOP P 3 component that did not change significantly with repeated task performance. The pre-infusion SSD distribution was bimodal, with mean values several hundred msec apart (FAST: 153 msec and SLOW: 390 msec). This suggested different response strategies: FAST SSD favoring “going” over “stopping,” and SLOW SSD favoring “stopping” over “going”. Exposure to alcohol at 60 mg/dL differentially affected the amplitude and latency of the STOP P 3 according to SSD group. Alcohol significantly reduced P 3 amplitude in the SLOW SSD compared to FAST SSD group, but significantly increased P 3 latency in the FAST SSD compared to SLOW SSD group. CONCLUSIONS The aSST is a robust and sensitive task for detecting alcohol induced changes in inhibition behavior {{as measured by the}} P 3 component in a within subject design. Alcohol was associated with P 3 component changes which varied by SSD group, suggesting a differential effect as a function of task strategy. Overall, the data support the potential utility of the aSST in the detection of alcohol response related AUD risk...|$|E
