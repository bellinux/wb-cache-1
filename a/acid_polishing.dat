40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{a number of}} gas flames for fire polishing borosilicate glass capillaries used in the manufacturing of IVF micro-pipettes. Hydrofluoric acid (HF) was also used {{as an alternative to}} finish the pipette end. Glass micro tools in the IVF industry are drawn from hollow glass capillaries of diameter 1 mm. These capillaries are cut manually to a length of 100 mm from hollow glass rods resulting in sharp and chipped edges. These capillaries are held in a customised holder having padding of soft silicone or rubber. Sharp and uneven edges of these capillaries pick up particles of rubber or soft silicone shavings, rendering them ineffective for IVF treatments. The working range of borosilicate glass is 800 - 1, 200 degrees C. The experiments involved analysis of fire polishing process for borosilicate glass capillaries using candle, butane, propane, 2350 butane propane, oxyacetylene gas flames, finding the optimum distance of the capillary relative to the flame, optimum time for which the capillary should be held in the flame and optimum region of the flame which gives the required temperature range. The results show that 2350 butane propane gas mix is optimum for fire polishing of borosilicate glass capillaries.

The biological consequences of such changes are poorly understood, and therefore, we have analyzed the cellular and molecular responses of osteoblasts that were plated on nanotubular anodized surface of a titanium-zirconium (TiZr) alloy. Upon comparing these results with those obtained on <b>acid</b> etched and <b>polished</b> surfaces of the same alloy, we observed a signiﬁcant increase in adhesion and proliferation of cells on anodized surfaces as compared to <b>acid</b> etched or <b>polished</b> surface.

The insects were harvested shortly before the female larvae reached maturity, i.e. in late June, usually around Saint John the Baptist's day (June 24), hence the dye's folk name, Saint John's blood. The harvesting process involved uprooting the host plant and picking the female larvae, averaging approximately ten insects from each plant. In Poland, including present-day Ukraine, and elsewhere in Europe, plantations were operated {{in order to deal}} with the high toll on the host plants. The larvae were killed with boiling water or vinegar and dried in the sun or in an oven, ground, and dissolved in sourdough or in light rye beer called kvass in order to remove fat. The extract could then be used for dyeing silk, wool, cotton, or linen. The dyeing process requires roughly 3-4oz of dye per pound (180-250g per kilogram) of silk and one pound of dye to color almost 20pounds (50g per kilogram) of wool.|$|R

On the other hand when the MTU was operated in anti-mist mode the emissions were greatly reduced and amine emissions down to 2 ppm were confirmed by manual emission measurements. A test with conventional mist abatement technology (Brownian diffusion filter) installed upstream the MTU was also performed. It was shown that the filter had large removal efficiency of H 2 SO 4, however still significant amine emissions persisted when the MTU was not operated in anti-mist mode.

The four treatment diets were a control consisting of a total mixed ration of grass silage and concentrates, and the total mixed ration supplemented with RP methionine, CSRFA or RP methionine plus CSRFA. Dry matter intake was not affected by diet. Milk yield increased when cows were given the diet with CSRFA, but supplementation of diets with RP methionine did not affect milk yield. Milk protein content, but not milk protein yield, decreased when CSRFA was given. The addition of RP methionine to the control diet and the CSRFA diet produced similar increases in the milk protein content. Supplementation of the diet with CSRFA significantly changed the milk fatty acid profile: the proportions of 10 : 0, 12 : 0, 14 : 0, 15 : 0 and 16 : 0 in milk fat decreased, but those of 18 : 0 and cis- 18 : 1 increased.

50|$|It is {{possible}} to combine different materials, or different heat treatments, to produce desirable qualities in a blade. For example, the finest Japanese swords were routinely made of up to seven sections of metals and even poorer quality swords were often made of two. These would include soft irons that could absorb the energy of impact without fracturing but which would bend and poorly retain an edge, and hard steels more liable to shatter on impact but which retained an edge well. The combination provided a sword that would resist impact, even though the edge could chip if abused, and while remaining sharp. Pattern welding involved forging together twisted bars of soft (bendable) low carbon and hard (brittle) higher carbon iron. This was done as historically furnaces were typically able to produce only one grade or the other and neither was well suited {{for more than a}} very limited use blade. The ability of modern steel makers to produce very high quality steels of various compositions has largely relegated this technique to either historical recreations or to artistic masterpieces.

The well-known methods for inner surface treatment of pipes include sandblasting, chemical cleaning with acid reagents (oxalic, formic, sulfamic, orthophosphoric <b>acids)</b> and electrochemical <b>polishing.</b> Disadvantages of the chemical method are cleaning-up irregularities, high metal removal, limited number of reagent application, complicated selection of reagent chemical composition and concentration, complicated and environmentally harmful recycling of waste chemicals, high cost of reagents. Low productivity at a high cost, as well as hazardous impact on personnel due to high dispersion of abrasive dust are considered as disadvantages of sandblasting. Electrochemical polishing is characterized by the following disadvantages: low processing productivity because supply of high currents is rather difficult due to electrolyte scattering capacity away from the main electrode action zone, limited length of the cavity to be treated due to heating of flexible current leads at operating current densities, application of expensive aggressive electrolytes and high costs of their recycling. A new method for polishing and cleaning of inner surfaces of tubular products based on electrolyte-plasma treatment has been developed.

The mean bond strength of sandblasted NickelShromium/ Vita VMK 95, polished Ni-Cr/Vila VMK 95, polished Titaruum/Vita VMK 95 and 50 Jlm sandblasted Titmlium/Vita VMK 95 were 49. 9 -tÃ‚Â± 9. 20, 44. 13 Ã‚Â± 7, 47, 23. 34 Ã‚Â± 6. 83, 39. 15 Ã‚Â± 5. 17 MPa, respectively. The sandblasted Ni-Cr group was significantly higher tllan that of the other tested groups. The polished titmlium showed the lowest bond strengtll among the four groups. Section 2 evaluated, by means of a 3 -point bendlllg test, the bond strcngtll of differcnt sandblasted titanium substratcs, (50 Jlm, 125 Jl 111, 250 Jlm), applied to three commercial low-fusing ceml 1 lic systems, (Vita Titankeranlik, Triceranl and Noritake). Noritake ceranuc had significantly higher bond strength than the other cemnlics. However, 110 significant difference vÃ‚Â·,as found between Tricemm and Vita Titmlkeranuk. No significant difference was detected between the three smldblasting treaUuents (p= 0. 165). The bond sU'ength of the sandblasted TilNoritake groups (48. 39 - 53. 30) MPa was comparable to the smldblasted Ni- Crgroup.. Section 3 evaluated, by mean of a 3 -point bending test, the bond strength of etched and coated titmlium substrates combined to Vita Titmlkeranlik ceranlic. The results showed that 10 % <b>acid</b> etched Ti, <b>polished</b> Ti, and the polished/silicon sputtered Ti groups have the lowest flexural bond strength among all study groups. The flexural bond strength of the polished! Si 3 N 4 sputtered Ti group was significantly Iligher (P<O. OO I) tllan Ilmt ofpolished Ti or polished! silicon spultered Ti groups. Section 4 investigated the eJIect of titarulUll specimens' preparation method; i. e. casting vs machining, on the fle:mral bond strcngth of ceranlic to titanium. The mean fleXtrral bond strength of the C<'lst Ti specimens was 44. 17 Ã‚Â±II. 9 I MPa while the mean bond strength of the machined Ti was 43. 33 Ã‚Â± 6. 72 MPa with a range between 26. 94 to 53, 41 MPa. No sigllificant difference between the cast <md machined groups was found (P= 0. 696). Section 5 investigated the effect of thermocycling on the bond strength of the three cenmlics systems to titanium. The mean bond strength of non-thermocycled Ti/Vita Titankeranlik, Til Triceranl, and TilNoritake groups were 44. 74 Ã‚Â± 11. 92, -l 0. 37 Ã‚Â± 10. 25, 52. 28 Ã‚Â± 5. 31 MPa, respectively while the thcrmocycled groups were 38. 6 H 7. 7 -l, 37. 53 Ã‚Â± 9. 30 and 5 I. I 9 Ã‚Â± 7 AI MPa. respectively. Supplied by The British Library - 'The world's knowledge'EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
