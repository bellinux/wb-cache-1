40|$|Abstract. We {{discuss the}} origin of the runaway early B-type star HD 271791 and show that its {{extremely}} high velocity (≃ 530 − 920 kms − 1) cannot be explained {{within the framework of the}} binary-supernova ejection scenario. Instead, we suggest that HD 271791 attained its peculiar velocity in the course of a strong dynamical encounter between two hard massive binaries or via an exchange encounter between <b>a</b> hard <b>massive</b> binary and <b>a</b> very <b>massive</b> star, formed through runaway mergers of ordinary massive stars in the dense core of <b>a</b> young <b>massive</b> star cluster...|$|R

50|$|The {{electromagnet}} has a 1000 mm radius through 72.5° {{to focus}} the secondary ions according to their mass/charge ratio according {{to the principles of}} the Lorentz force.
