At the beginning of 1933, a new 76mm KT tank gun mod. 1927/32 with reduced (from 900mm to 500mm) recoil length was installed into the A-43 turret. The turret was still a very tight place for crew members. The ammunition stowage for 54 rounds was unsuccessful, and the military refused the A-43 turret.|$|E

500|$|Following the match, Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{claimed that}} the gesture he made had been {{intended}} for the media and not Liverpool fans: [...] "The signal of close your mouth was not for them but for the press, they speak too much and in my opinion they try to do everything to disturb Chelsea. Wait, don't speak too soon. We lost two matches and in my opinion you (the media) try to take confidence from us and put pressure on us."

It was originally scheduled {{to run in the}} Boston Legal time slot for just four weeks, but after receiving high ratings remained in the time slot {{for the remainder of the}} season. ABC Entertainment President Steve McPherson commented on the scheduling decision: [...] "Ultimately we decided that, without having adequate lead time or marketing dollars to devote to moving either show so late in the season, we'd continue to let 'Grey's' build on its tremendous momentum through May." [...] Prior to broadcast, it was announced that the show's title would change from Grey's Anatomy to Complications, although ultimately this did not come to pass. Francie Calfo, executive vice president for development at ABC Entertainment, commented on the show's conception: [...] "I think there was a need for this kind of show on our air, specifically a medical show. And Shonda found a twist on it that made it perfect for where we're at right now.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s the Soviet Union was embarking on {{political}} and economic reform.

On 26 December 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed, ending all aid and trade concessions, such as cheap oil. Without Soviet aid, the flow of imports to the North Korean agricultural sector ended, and the government proved too inflexible to respond. In 1991, energy imports fell by 75%. The economy went into a downward spiral, with imports and exports falling in tandem. Flooded coal mines required electricity to operate pumps, and the shortage of coal worsened the shortage of electricity. Agriculture relied on electrically powered irrigation systems and artificial fertilizers and pesticides, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> hit by the economic collapse.|$|E

[...] The game featured few penalties, no injuries, and few substitutions. [...] Michigan made only three substitutions, and Vanderbilt not a one. Michigan completed 5 out of 16 passes for 90 yards.

Writing about a live performance in the New York Times, critic Peter Watrous said of Chilton that [...] "He's a soul and blues guitar connoisseur; he chooses his guitar licks as carefully as he does the blues songs he covers, and during his solos, a listener heard a history of soul and blues guitar."

2500|$|The Sandinistas' {{relationship}} with the Roman Catholic Church deteriorated as the Contra War continued. The hierarchy refused {{to speak out against}} the counterrevolutionary activities of the contras and failed to denounce American military aid. State media accused the Catholic Church of being reactionary and supporting the Contras. According to former President Ortega, [...] "The conflict with the church was strong, and it costs us, but I don't think it was our fault. ... There were so many people being wounded every day, so many people dying, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> for us to understand the position of the church hierarchy in refusing to condemn the contras." [...] The hierarchy-state tensions were brought to the fore with Pope John Paul II 1983 visit to Nicaragua. Hostility to the Catholic Church became so great that at one point, FSLN militants shouted down Pope John Paul II as he tried to say Mass. Therefore, while the activities of the Catholic church contributed {{to the success of the}} Sandinista revolution, the hierarchy's opposition was a major factor in the downfall of the revolutionary government.|$|E
2500|$|McManaman, however, {{failed to}} win over new England coach Glenn Hoddle despite being in {{excellent}} club form in the years Hoddle was in charge, raising questions about either his effort, his attitude, or {{his relationship with the}} manager, with some sections of the British press even lobbying Hoddle to pick McManaman. Hoddle stated in interviews that he wanted McManaman to take up the licence to be the bridge between David Beckham and Paul Gascoigne, and often spoke highly of McManaman's ability, but noted that McManaman's best position was [...] "floating" [...] dangerously <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to fit him into a system to suit the team and so he often selected Paul Merson and the rising Beckham instead. When McManaman (and Fowler) opted out of Le Tournoi in 1997 to choose to undergo non-urgent medical operations ahead of international duty, it was noted that this reportedly lost them their team spots as Hoddle though angered at losing them, found a winning team in their absence, and this made it even harder for McManaman to regain his place later. McManaman made a total of four appearances under Hoddle, and only one appearance at the 1998 World Cup against Colombia, as a substitute for Paul Scholes.|$|E
