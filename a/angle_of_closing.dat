40|$|This paper {{describes}} a systematic numerical {{investigation of the}} sound transmission loss through a multilayer system consisting of a bagged gas and lightweight panel. The goal {{of the study is}} to better understand the effect of the gas on transmission loss and determine whether a gas with a slow speed of sound is beneficial for noise control applications. As part of the study, the density and speed of sound of the gas are varied independently {{to assess the impact of}} each on transmission loss. Results show that near grazing incidence the plane wave transmission loss through the multilayer system is more sensitive to the speed of sound than the density of the gas. In addition, it was found that a slow wave speed in the bagged gas provides more low-frequency transmission loss benefit than a fast wave speed. At low <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> incidence, <b>close</b> to the plate normal, the benefit is due to the reduction of the characteristic impedance of the gas. At high <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> incidence, the benefit is attributed to the fact that the incident waves at the air/gas interface are bent towards the surface normal. Since transmission loss is angle dependent, refraction in the slow gas layer results in a significant improvement in the transmission loss at high <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> incidence...|$|R
40|$|Flying {{squirrels}} {{are well}} known {{for their ability to}} glide between trees {{at the top of a}} forest canopy. We present experimental performance and behavioural evidence that flight in flying squirrels may have evolved out of a need to control landing forces. Northern flying squirrels were filmed jumping from a horizontal branch to a much larger vertical pole. These were both slightly compliant (less than 1. 9 mm N- 1), and instrumented using strain gauges so that forces could be measured. Take-off and landing forces were both positively correlated with horizontal range between 0. 5 and 2. 5 m (r= 0. 355 and r= 0. 811, respectively, P < 0. 05), but not significantly different to each other at each range tested. Take-off forces ranged from 1 to 10 bodyweights, and landing forces were between 3 and 10 bodyweights. Glide angles increased rapidly with horizontal range, approaching 45 degrees at 3 m, above which they gradually decreased, suggesting that northern flying squirrels are optimised for long distance travel. We show that northern flying squirrels initiate full gliding posture at ranges of less than 1 m, without landing any higher than an equivalent ballistic projectile. However, this gliding posture enables them to pitch upwards, potentially stalling the wing, and spreads the landing reaction force over all four extended limbs. At steeper approach <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>close</b> to 45 degrees, flying squirrels were unable to pitch up sufficiently and landed forelimbs first, consequently sustaining higher impact forces. We investigate four hypotheses to explain the origin of flight in these animals and conclude that the need to reduce landing impact forces was most likely to have stimulated the development of aerial control in flying squirrels...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{we propose}} a {{strategy}} for speeding-up the computation of the aerodynamics of industrial high-lift configurations using a residual-based reduced-order model (ROM). The ROM {{is based on the}} proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of a set of solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations governing fluid flow at different parameter values, from which a set of orthogonal basis vectors is evaluated. By considering an initial set of few snapshots at different <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> attack, a ROM is constructed which is used to predict a solution at an <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack which is just outside the space spanned by the POD basis vectors. The ROM solution is subsequently used to initialize the flow solver for an accurate calculation of the aerodynamics at the same flow condition. This procedure is conducted repetitively for a series <b>of</b> <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> attack, whereby for each and every ROM prediction, the snapshots set is augmented with the latest CFD computed flow solution. Using this strategy, a considerable reduction in the total number of iterations to reach the converged steady-state solution is achieved when compared with conventional computational techniques used in industry for a series of computations such as drag polar computations. The methodology is applied and demonstrated on a two-element airfoil and a body-wing aircraft in high-lift configuration. Furthermore, an investigation is conducted on the behavior of the reduced-order modeling approach at <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> attack <b>close</b> to and within the static stall region, where aerodynamic hysteresis may occur and the aerodynamic coefficients are found to be multiple-valued functions <b>of</b> the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack.
