50|$|The station {{building}} and yard dominates {{the south side}} of the main street (Clermont Street). The station building, though very similar to earlier buildings of this group at Mount Morgan (1898) and Archer Park (1899), is distinguished by the semi-circular roof to the central portico which is in other respects similar to its precursors. Flanking pavilions are also distinctive elements having window shades and pedimented treatment with louvred lunettes, repeating the motif established by the central portico. The roadside verandah has cast iron columns and is partially built-in. The platform shade, unlike the carriage shades of the earlier designs has cast iron posts with a curved roof, comparing with South Brisbane (Melbourne Street) and Wallangarra. Accommodation consists of the central vestibule with former booking office and station masters office to the east (now office for maintenance staff and the stock officer) and former refreshment rooms to the west (now station offices). The recent interior fit-outs are generally unsympathetic although it is understood the original ceilings are in situ. Later quarters for refreshment room staff are attached at the west end. The goods shed is a 20 x 60 foot gable roofed timber frame c.g.i. clad building with 2 doors to each side. The double <b>rail</b> <b>weighbridge</b> faces the passenger platform. The houses are contributary and also face the passenger platform from across the yard. The westernmost of the 3 is elevated with pyramidal roof, peripheral verandah and is relatively devoid of ornamentation. The present rolling stock depot includes a recent wagon shed erected over the site of the original engine shed drop pit which is stone and brick lined, and another shed 7 bays long with concrete floor slab and pit to a single siding and surmounting bow string truss roof.|$|R

Majority of the level crossing positions are not guided by any accident preventive mechanism and even not accompanied by a skilled person. This paper presents an <b>automatic</b> <b>rail</b> gate control system at level crossing positions and accident prevention mechanism. Two vibration sensors are used to control the open and close state of the gate at level crossing position. An ultrasonic sensor is positioned to detect an unauthorized object on the track. Open and Close status of the gate and unauthorized object on the track will be communicated with the central control room using wireless communication protocol. The experimental results proved the proposed mechanism is a prudent approach to safeguard the human and to curtail the train accidents. Keywords: Rail gate, Vibration sensor, ultrasonic sensor...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} various operating systems, developed and implemented at the Athens Tram network {{to reduce the}} airborne noise emitted in the sharp curves of the tramway. From {{the first days of}} the network's operation (Olympic Games 2004), the problem of producing airborne squealing noise in certain sharp curves of the tramway was revealed, with a series of complaints to be recorded from residents in certain urban areas, regarding especially squealing noise emissions introducing annoying peak levels especially during evening & night hours. The problem was treated, initially, by coating the tracks with biodegradable lubricant, at sharp curves, where it appeared that friction phenomena were significant. The coating has been performed manually for some years by maintenance personnel of the network, providing suitable results by the acoustic measurement program. Even though this intervention has produced positive results, as well as alternative technical solutions relating to the installation of mechanisms for <b>automatic</b> lubrication of <b>rails</b> with special friction modifiers, they were proven not to be feasible economically. Therefore an <b>automatic</b> <b>rail</b> wetting system was implied, containing sensors to detect approaching trams, water supply, timer, solenoid valves, pipes and common irrigation vaporizers. The system is quite simple and is implemented using common components of retail trade, many of which are already used in existing irrigation network of the tramway, while the maintenance does not require trained staff, it is performed by the staff of TRAM SA and in connection with the maintenance of the irrigation network. The results of recently executed detailed noise monitoring programs, performed by the University of Thessaly (Faculty of Civil Engineering), are presented for both implemented technical solutions that indicate significant reduction in squealing noise emissions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Rail {{tracking}} system (RTS) is {{an advanced method}} used to track and monitor any train equipped with a MCU unit that receives and transfers signals through GPS satellite. RTS {{is a combination of}} Global Positioning System (GPS) that provides actual geographic real time position of each train. The entire transmission mechanism of RTS setup depends on GPS satellite, a receiver on the train, a GSM system and controller based tracking for dispatch. The GSM communication system is generally the same as cellular phone network. The two most common RTS systems are like GPS based and Signpost based. The Signpost-based RTS system was used earlier but with the development of modern satellites GPS used technology is more use now. This <b>Automatic</b> <b>rail</b> Tracking system is now widely used in a variety of market system that offers excellent communication or train tracking solution. This project is aimed to track the vehicles that which mean to locate the position of the train. The location of the train is indicated using GPS (global positioning system) technology. Communication link is made possible through a GPS receiver. GPS will give the information of parameters like longitude, latitude and attitude. Here the communication takes place between GPS receiver and GPS satellite. GPS satellite continuously tracks the missing train and the position of the train is send to the controller from GPS receiver. train is associated with LCD display which sends the continuous information about the position of the train to the control unit and the train position should be send to the GSM. 1...|$|R

25|$|The Tomlinson coupler was {{developed}} by the Ohio Brass Company for mass transit applications, but eventually found use in some mainline railroad vehicles as well. It consists of two squared metal hooks that engage with each other in a larger rectangular frame with air line connections above and below. Since the coupler's development the manufacturing arm of Ohio Brass was purchased by WABCO which now manufacturers the line along with the N-type. The Tomlinson coupler is the most widely used fully <b>automatic</b> heavy <b>rail</b> coupling in North America having been adopted by the DC Metro, MBTA, PATCO Speedline, SEPTA Broad Street Subway, LA Metro, Baltimore Metro, Miami Metro, MARTA Rail and the New York City Subway for its R44/R46 fleet and all modern classes starting with the R142. For applications outside of rapid transit the coupler had to be significantly enlarged to meet the increased strength requirements first appearing in this capacity on the Budd Metroliner and later on the Illinois Central Highliner fleet. Its relative lack of strength is one reason the N-Type has been more successful in the mainline railroad arena.|$|R
500|$|The {{first phase}} of {{construction}} involved building 18 new platforms with two track bays to handle parcels above this, along with a signal and communications building and various staff offices. The parcel deck was reinforced by 5,500 tons of structural steelwork.

Fifteen platforms had been complete by 1966, and the full electric service began on 3 January. A fully automated parcel depot, sited above platforms 3 to 18, opened on 7 August 1966. The new station was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 14 October 1968.|$|R
40|$|For safety purposes, {{railroad}} tracks {{need to be}} inspected {{on a regular basis}} for physical defects or design non-compliances. Such track defects and non-compliances, if not detected in a timely manner, may eventually lead to grave consequences such as train derailments. In this paper, we present a real-time <b>automatic</b> vision-based <b>rail</b> inspection system, with main focus on anchors-an important rail component type, and anchor-related rail defects, or exceptions. Our system robustly detects impor-tant rail components including ties, tie plates, anchors with high accuracy and efficiency. Detected objects are then con-solidated across video frames and across camera views to map to physical rail objects, by combining the video data streams from all camera views with GPS information and speed information from the distance measuring instrument (DMI). After these rail components are detected and con-solidated, further data integration and analysis is followed to detect sequence-level track defects, or exceptions. Quan-titative analysis performed on a real online field test con-ducted on different track conditions demonstrates that our system achieves very promising performance in terms of rail component detection, anchor condition assessment, and compliance-level exception detection. We also show that our system outperforms another advanced rail inspection system in anchor detection. 1. Introduction and Relate...|$|R
40|$|Freeform {{parametric}} curves are extensively {{employed in}} various {{fields such as}} computer graphics, computer vision, robotics, and geometric modelling. While manyapplications exploit and combine univariate freeform entities into more complex forms such as sculptured surfaces, the problem of a fair or even optimal relative parameterization of free forms, under some norm, has been rarely considered. In this work, we present a scheme that closely approximates the optimal relativematching between two or even n given freeform curves, under a user's prescribed norm {{that is based on}} differential properties of the curves. This matching is computed as a reparameterization of n - 1 of the curves that can be applied explicitly using composition. The proposed matching algorithm is completely automaticand has been successfully employed in different applications with several demonstrated herein: metamorphosis of freeform curves with feature preservations, keyframe interpolation for animation, self-intersection free ruled surface construction, and <b>automatic</b> matching of <b>rail</b> curves of blending surfaces...|$|R
50|$|The {{report was}} {{published}} in 1989, and found no fault in the Littlehampton train or signalling system, concluded that the driver had failed to keep the train's speed under control, missing the preceding caution signal and passed the danger signal protecting the Horsham train. The line is equipped with four aspect colour light signalling and British <b>Rail's</b> <b>Automatic</b> Warning System (AWS). However, the report noted that the signal had {{a high incidence of}} being passed at danger - four drivers had previously passed the signal when at danger in the previous five years. The AWS in use gave the same warning for either of the caution signals and danger and was capable of being reset by a driver in a lapse of concentration. The report recommended that an automatic train protection system should be introduced without delay and in the interim a repeater for the signal that had been passed be installed.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Since {{the construction of the}} first electronic computer, forty years ago, reliability has been an important consideration in the minds of computer designers. However, the available technology limited early efforts at fault-tolerance, error-checking and fault recovery. The early valve and discrete transistor machines tended to be large and heavy, unsuitable for applications such as on-board automatic train control, even with no error detection and safety systems. With improvements in component technology, vehicle-borne control electronics has become a practical reality, but until the emergence of large scale integrated circuits (LSI) constraints on fault detection systems remained. The review sections of this thesis trace the development of high-reliability computing techniques, in particular those applied to vehicle control. Control designs are becoming more ambitious, and as microprocessors rival minicomputers for speed and instruction set power, multiprocessing at low cost is easily attainable. In this atmosphere of cheap computer power, the British <b>Rail</b> <b>Automatic</b> Train Operation (ERATO) project was born. Seven microprocessor systems were to run three programs to effect (almost) driverless train control and more. The research for this thesis involved examining the alternative methods for tackling the problems of safety and availability in a train-borne system. The design and development of a multiprocessing module, Cyclone I will be described. Cyclone I contains three l 6 bit microprocessors and three program stores and runs as a compact self-checking multiprocessor. When fully developed, the design will be suitable not only for train systems, but for other applications requiring a high confidence level in the output control signals...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{scientific}} paper {{focuses on}} {{development of a}} method for mechanical parameters control of the neutral relay of <b>rail</b> <b>automatics</b> by current analyzing in the coil and the relay contacts at switching based on wavelet transform. Methodology. The methodology was based on current analysis of the relay coil and contacts currents under its switching and analysis obtained results by using wavelet transform. Findings. The time dependences of the current in coil and in contacts under switching {{on and off for}} the operable relays and relays with certain defects have been measured at different voltages applied to coil (10, 12 и 14 V). When voltage applied to coil was increased the rate of coil current increased, but time constant of the circuit was changed with voltage slightly. The current value maximum at which the relay armature begun to move for the operable relays was depended on applied voltage slightly. For the time interval, at which armature was putted to the relay core fully, time constant of the circuit was changed with voltage slightly also. The maximum current value at which the armature starts to move to the relay serviceable little dependent on the applied voltage. For site based in which the anchor is completely dragged constant current rise time is also a little dependent on the applied voltage. Similar results were obtained for the current reduction time constant with turning off the voltage and current confinement. The current pick-up and the current release of the armature increases for the relay with the load anchor is proportional to the weight of cargo, {{as well as for the}} relay contact with the rear, bent down, while the flexural rear contact up these currents have smaller values. Large-scale (low-frequency) coefficients of DWT can be used for a more accurate comparison of the current pick-up, and release time constants of the transient. Small scale coefficients fiberboard (HF) can be used as distinguishing traits defects mobile relay system. Originality. For the first time, on the basis of the research proposed to use detailing coefficients of a discrete wavelet transform as a symptom of mobile relay system. The approximation (smoothing) ratios can be used for a more accurate comparison of the current pick-up, and release time constants of the transient to detect defects of the electromagnetic relay system. Practical value. The studies conducted by the author can be used to develop stand-aided control of a technical condition of the relay neutral railway automation...|$|R
