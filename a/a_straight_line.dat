5|$|Linear motions (or {{translatory}} motions), which {{move in a}} {{line between}} two points. Rectilinear motion is motion in <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> between two points, whereas curvilinear motion is motion following a curved path.|$|E

Toward the end of the century, the Edwardian look made a larger physique more popular—Edward VII having a large figure.|$|R

5|$|These {{actions are}} {{represented}} in a form of visual shorthand by the three basic elements of Feynman diagrams: a wavy line for the photon, <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> for the electron and a junction of two straight lines and a wavy one for a vertex representing emission or absorption of a photon by an electron. These can all {{be seen in the}} adjacent diagram.|$|E
5|$|A worm whose ruleset {{begins with}} 0 {{continues}} in <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> forever. This is a trivial case, {{so it is}} usually stipulated that the worm must turn when it encounters a point with only uneaten gridlines. Furthermore, to avoid mirror-image symmetrical duplicates, the worm's first turn must be a right hand turn. A worm dies if it returns to its origin a third time, because there are then no untraversed edges available. Only the origin can be lethal to the worm.|$|E
5|$|Along {{this route}} between New Haven and Hartford, the Hartford and New Haven Turnpike was {{chartered}} in 1798 and opened in 1799, beginning at Grove Street in New Haven and leaving on Whitney Avenue, passing via Meriden and Berlin, and entering Hartford on Maple Avenue.

5|$|Galileo {{put forward}} the basic {{principle}} of relativity, {{that the laws}} of physics are the same in any system that is moving at a constant speed in <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line,</b> regardless of its particular speed or direction. Hence, there is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic framework for Newton's laws of motion and is central to Einstein's special theory of relativity.|$|E
5|$|Often, the {{migration}} route of a long-distance migrator bird doesn't follow <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> between breeding and wintering grounds. Rather, it could follow a hooked or arched line, with detours around geographical barriers. For most land-birds, such barriers could consist in seas, large water bodies or high mountain ranges, {{because of the}} lack of stopover or feeding sites, or the lack of thermal columns for broad-winged birds.|$|E
5|$|Second, the longitudes of {{ascending}} nodes {{of the two}} bodies—the points {{where they}} cross the ecliptic—are in near-resonance with the above libration. When the two longitudes are the same—that is, when one could draw <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> through both nodes and the Sun—Pluto's perihelion lies exactly at 90°, and hence it comes closest to the Sun when it is highest above Neptune's orbit. This {{is known as the}} 1:1 superresonance. All the Jovian planets, particularly Jupiter, {{play a role in the}} creation of the superresonance.|$|E

5|$|The Lineweaver–Burk plot or double {{reciprocal}} plot is {{a common}} way of illustrating kinetic data.

5|$|The Pipeline Authorization Act {{required}} the pipeline {{to be able}} to withstand the maximum earthquake ever recorded in the area it was built. When crossing the Denali Fault, Teflon-coated sliders were designed to allow the pipeline to move side-to-side in an earthquake. To protect against forward-and-backward shocks and to allow for thermal expansion, the pipeline wasn't designed as <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line.</b> Instead, it was intended to be laid in an S-shape, and the bends would allow for expansion and movement without breaking.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> planar <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> graph is <b>a</b> graph {{in which}} the {{vertices}} are embedded as points in the Euclidean plane, and the edges are embedded as non-crossing line segments. Fáry's theorem states that any planar graph may be represented as <b>a</b> planar <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> graph. <b>A</b> triangulation is <b>a</b> planar <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> graph to which no more edges may be added, so called because every face is necessarily a triangle; a special case {{of this is the}} Delaunay triangulation, a graph defined from a set of points in the plane by connecting two points with an edge whenever there exists a circle containing only those two points.|$|R
5|$|The {{strategy}} {{appears to}} work equally well in insects and in vertebrates. Simulations show that motion camouflage {{results in a}} more efficient pursuit path than classical pursuit (i.e. the motion camouflage path is shorter), whether the target flies in <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> or chooses a chaotic path. Further, where classical pursuit requires the attacker to fly faster than the target, the motion camouflaged attacker can sometimes capture the target despite flying more slowly than it.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} sales of hybrid electric vehicles in several countries, {{some members of the}} blind community have raised concerns about the noise reduction when those vehicles operate in all-electric mode, as blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets and feel quiet hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard. Although a 2009 study found no statistically significant difference in pedestrian crashes involving quiet hybrid vehicles when compared to noisier vehicles when both types of vehicles were travelling in <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line,</b> it found a doubling of hybrid vehicle pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc. at slow speeds.|$|E
