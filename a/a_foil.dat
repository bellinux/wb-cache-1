5|$|Johnson {{signed for}} Everton in 1930, acting as <b>a</b> <b>foil</b> for the {{prolific}} centre-forward Dixie Dean. In four seasons at Everton Johnson won the Second Division, the First Division and the FA Cup, before finishing his professional career {{with a short}} spell at Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Prince Rainbow: A god-figure {{who serves}} as <b>a</b> <b>foil</b> to El-ahrairah. He {{attempts}} to rein in El-ahrirah several times, but is always outsmarted by the rabbit.|$|E
5|$|Adam {{was created}} during {{executive}} producer Russell T Davies original pitch to the BBC {{as part of}} his plans to revive Doctor Who for the channel. Though established early in the series' planning, Adam was always intended to be a short-term character. Though reviewers generally reacted negatively to the character, Adam's role as <b>a</b> <b>foil</b> to the stock companion figure has been praised alongside the moral lessons of his departure.|$|E

5|$|In Mark, {{the disciples}} play hardly any role {{other than a}} {{negative}} one. While others sometimes respond to Jesus with complete faith, his disciples are puzzled and doubtful. They serve as <b>a</b> <b>foil</b> to Jesus and to other characters. The failings of the disciples are probably exaggerated in Mark, and the disciples make a better showing in Matthew and Luke.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{generally}} {{agree that}} Sycorax, <b>a</b> <b>foil</b> for Prospero, {{is closely related}} to the Medea of Ovid's Metamorphoses. Postcolonialist writers and critics see Sycorax as giving voice to peoples, particularly women, recovering from the effects of colonisation. Later versions of The Tempest, beginning with William Davenant's eighteenth-century adaptation, have given Sycorax a vocal role in the play, but maintained her image as a malevolent antagonist to Prospero.|$|E
5|$|Frankenstein, MD is {{presented}} as an educational webseries presented by medical students (and later doctors) Victoria Frankenstein and Iggy DeLacey from the fictional Engle State University. Each episode generally consists of Frankenstein experimenting with cutting-edge medical technologies or theories, often using DeLacey or her childhood friends Eli Lavenza and Rory Clerval as subjects. Dr. Abraham Waldman serves {{as an adviser to}} Frankenstein, usually acting as <b>a</b> <b>foil</b> and reminding her of the impracticality or perceived impossibility of her experiments and theories.|$|E
50|$|While {{in office}} as {{governor}} in 1981, Evans' 29-year-old son John {{was the target}} of <b>a</b> <b>foiled</b> kidnapping attempt in Burley.|$|R

50|$|The President cited <b>a</b> <b>foiled</b> terror plot in Los Angeles, where terrorists {{supposedly}} {{planned to}} hijack {{a plane and}} fly it into the Liberty Tower.|$|R
5|$|Gaara {{was created}} <b>a</b> <b>foil</b> to the series' eponymous character, Naruto Uzumaki, {{as the two}} were born through similar circumstances, but develop vastly {{different}} personalities due to a troubled upbringing. His designs and name underwent {{major changes in the}} making of his final one which also was modified in later arcs to give Gaara a design that is easier to draw. In the Japanese version of the series, Gaara is voiced by Akira Ishida while Liam O'Brien replaces him in the English dub.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by the Evil Queen in Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Lady Tremaine in Disney's Cinderella (1950), Gothel was {{developed}} by directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard into a much more complex villain than the fairy tale witch upon whom she is based because the character is forced to rely solely on her wit, charisma and intelligence as opposed to sorcery in order to survive. The film's most difficult character to develop, Gothel's exotic appearance, whose beauty, dark curly hair and voluptuous figure were deliberately drawn to serve as <b>a</b> <b>foil</b> to Rapunzel's, was inspired by both Murphy and American singer Cher.|$|E
5|$|Richard White as Gaston – A vain {{hunter who}} vies for Belle's hand in {{marriage}} and is {{determined not to}} let anyone else win her heart. He serves as <b>a</b> <b>foil</b> personality to the Beast, who was once as egotistic as Gaston prior to his transformation. Gaston's supervising animator, Andreas Deja, was pressed by Jeffrey Katzenberg to make Gaston handsome in contrast to the traditional appearance of a Disney villain, an assignment he found difficult at first. In the beginning, Gaston is depicted as more of a narcissist than a villain, but later he leads all the villagers to kill the beast, enraged that Belle would love a Beast more than him.|$|E
50|$|Lodge was {{the target}} of <b>a</b> <b>foiled</b> murder plot in 1998. He is married to Patti Anne Lodge, a state senator from Huston in Canyon County.|$|R
50|$|The Bojinka Plot was <b>a</b> <b>foiled</b> {{large-scale}} al-Qaeda {{terrorist attack}} {{to blow up}} eleven airliners and their passengers as they flew from Asia to America, due {{to take place in}} January 1995.|$|R
50|$|The film {{begins with}} Tommy Lucero (Antonio Banderas) being caught by French police {{following}} <b>a</b> <b>foiled</b> robbery at <b>a</b> museum. Tommy seems confident {{he will not}} remain in police custody very long.|$|R
5|$|The {{production}} team's {{approach to}} the character and Eccleston's portrayal were highlighted as being intentionally different from his predecessors, with Eccleston stating that his character would be less eccentric. To fit in with a 21st-century audience, the Doctor was given a primary companion, Rose Tyler, who {{was designed to be}} as independent and courageous as himself. He also briefly travels with Adam Mitchell, a self-serving boy genius who acts as <b>a</b> <b>foil</b> to the companions but ultimately proves unworthy, and Jack Harkness, a reformed con man from the 51st century. The Doctor, Rose and Jack form a close team but are separated in the series finale in which each character has to make difficult choices and face sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|The will, Balzac cautions, is a {{destructive}} force that seeks only to acquire power unless tempered by knowledge. The shopkeeper presents <b>a</b> <b>foil</b> for Valentin's future self, offering study and mental development {{as an alternative}} to consuming desire. Foedora also serves as a model for resistance to the corruption of will, insofar as she seeks at all times to excite desire in others while never giving in to her own. That Valentin is happiest living in the material squalor of his tiny garret– lost in study and writing, with the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him– underscores the irony of his misery {{at the end of the}} book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.|$|E
5|$|Gupte {{described}} his character as mercurial, and found playing him a physical delight. Gupte said his character keeps the frame unpredictable {{and that it}} provided him with <b>a</b> <b>foil</b> to express rage and anguish. He worked a lot on his characterisation and tried to bring in his own references from European and Japanese cinema. Chandan Roy Sanyal {{described his}} character Mikhail as provocative, mad, wicked and humorous. Subramnayam and Joshi, who played Lobo and Lele respectively, described their characters as the most corrupt policemen in their department at the Anti-Narcotics Bureau. They said that {{to prepare for the}} roles they followed the script and Bhardwaj's instructions to get the characters right. Mukherjee prepared for his role as Mujeeb by reading the script and understanding the characters, and discussing it with Bhardwaj. Dutta, who played Shumona Bengali criminal involved in fixing horse races and arms dealingsaid {{that he did not have}} much time to prepare for his role because he was given the script after he arrived in Mumbai, where Bhardwaj briefed him.|$|E
5000|$|Susie's mom: She {{is shown}} {{from the waist}} down in <b>a</b> <b>foiled</b> attempt to pester Susie, and is also seen having a brief {{dialogue}} during Susie's first experience with Calvin's alter-ego, Stupendous Man.|$|R

They also show the player's position (Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder or Forward) at the back of the card. Star players and Goal Stoppers sport <b>a</b> glitter <b>foil</b> effect while Fan's Favourites sport <b>a</b> Rainbow <b>Foil</b> effect. Champions sports <b>a</b> black/gold <b>foil</b> effect.|$|R
5|$|Shakespeare {{borrowed}} {{the character of}} Banquo from Holinshed's Chronicles, a history of Britain published by Raphael Holinshed in 1587. In Chronicles Banquo is an accomplice to Macbeth {{in the murder of}} the king, rather than a loyal subject of the king who is seen as an enemy by Macbeth. Shakespeare may have changed this aspect of his character to please King James, who was thought at the time to be a descendant of the real Banquo. Critics often interpret Banquo's role in the play as being <b>a</b> <b>foil</b> to Macbeth, resisting evil where Macbeth embraces it. Sometimes, however, his motives are unclear, and some critics question his purity. He does nothing to accuse Macbeth of murdering the king, even though he has reason to believe Macbeth is responsible.|$|E
5|$|Writing the {{screenplay}} took about six months. During this period, Gidding worked alone, {{and although he}} passed some of his work to Wise to show him that work on {{the screenplay}} was progressing well, he and Wise did not otherwise collaborate on the screenplay. The screenplay made other changes to the story. The number of characters was cut down, the back story was significantly shortened, most of the supernatural events depicted in the novel were kept off-screen, and {{the greater part of}} the action was set inside the house to heighten the audience's feeling of claustrophobia. Eleanor's role as an outcast was also emphasized. The character of Theodora was given a sharper, slightly more cruel sense of humor in order to make her <b>a</b> <b>foil</b> for Eleanor but also to heighten Eleanor's outsider status. The role of Luke was made more flippant, and Dr. Markway (Montague in the novel) was made a more confident character. The screenplay was finished just after Wise completed work on West Side Story.|$|E
25|$|A {{parody of}} Goodall {{appears in the}} webcomic, Irregular Webcomic! as <b>a</b> <b>foil</b> to Steve, himself a parody of Steve Irwin. She would later appear as herself {{interacting}} with the comic's writer, David Morgan-Mar.|$|E

50|$|Incense paper {{used for}} {{ancestor}} worship comes in several forms; each represents {{a present for}} the ancestor's spirit. Paper coloured yellow with <b>a</b> gold <b>foil</b> printed on it represents a gold tael; that with <b>a</b> silver <b>foil</b> represents <b>a</b> silver tael.|$|R
50|$|Among the group's {{followers}} were Arid Uka, {{the perpetrator}} of the 2011 Frankfurt Airport shooting. The group {{has also been}} linked to Halil D., the suspected perpetrator behind <b>a</b> <b>foiled</b> terror bombing plot against a Frankfurt cycling race in May 2015.|$|R
25|$|The {{protagonist of}} Submission (2015), a {{controversial}} novel by Michel Houellebecq, is a literary scholar specializing in Huysmans and his work; Huysmans's relation to Catholicism serves as <b>a</b> <b>foil</b> for the book's treatment of Islam in France.|$|E
25|$|Jack Blessing as MacGillicudy: MacGillicudy is a Blue Moon {{employee}} and became <b>a</b> <b>foil</b> for Herbert Viola and a rival for Agnes’s affections. Debuting in season three, {{he appeared in}} 17 of the series’ 66 episodes.|$|E
25|$|Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore), {{a single}} native Minnesotan, moves to Minneapolis in 1970 at age 30 and becomes Associate Producer of WJM-TV's Six O'Clock News. Her sincere, kind {{demeanor}} often acts as <b>a</b> <b>foil</b> for the personalities of her co-workers and friends.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{cambered}} <b>foil</b> can be {{more efficient}} than <b>a</b> symmetrical <b>foil,</b> but <b>a</b> rigid cambered <b>foil</b> is efficient for producing lift in just one direction. The Lunocet uses the water pressure to induce camber in the flexible flukes which are symmetric at rest. The camber is dynamic and changes sides with up and down stroke. The flexibility is mostly at the tips and trailing edge.|$|R
40|$|The {{magnetic}} compass orientation of birds is light dependent [1, 2]. The respective directional information, originating in radical pair processes [3 – 5], is {{mediated by the}} right eye [6]. These findings suggest possible interactions between magnetoreception and vision, in particular with the perception of contours, because the right eye {{has been found to}} be dominant in discrimination tasks requiring object vision [7 – 9]. Here we report tests in the local geomagnetic field with European robins wearing goggles equipped with a clear and <b>a</b> frosted <b>foil</b> of equal translucence of 70 %. Robins with <b>a</b> clear <b>foil</b> on the right eye and <b>a</b> frosted <b>foil</b> on the left eye oriented in the migratory direction as well as birds using both eyes.
