25|$|Police {{officers}} found a {{fire extinguisher}} and squirted its foam into {{the wounds of}} an injured occupant. Other occupants were thrown down the stairs head-first. Eventually, they dragged all occupants into the ground-floor hall, where they had gathered dozens of prisoners {{from all over the}} building in <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> <b>of</b> blood and excrement. They threw her on top of two other people. They were not moving, and Lena Zuhlke drowsily asked them if they were alive. They did not reply, and she lay there on her back, unable to move her right arm, unable to stop her left arm and her legs twitching, blood seeping out of her head wounds. A group of police officers walked by, and each one lifted the bandana which concealed his identity, leaned down and spat on her face. Many victims of the raid were taken to the San Martino hospital, where police officers walked up and down the corridors, slapping their clubs into the palms of their hands, ordering the injured not to move around or look out of the window, keeping handcuffs on many of them and then, often with injuries still untended, shipping them across the city to join scores of others, from the Diaz school and from the street demonstrations, detained at the detention centre in the city's Bolzaneto district.|$|E

500|$|After Bamber was convicted, {{the trial}} judge, Mr Justice Drake, {{expressed}} concern about the [...] "less than thorough investigation". The Times wrote about [...] "blunders, omissions and ineptitude". According to Claire Powell, [...] "doing a Bamber" [...] briefly became police slang for making <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> <b>of</b> a case. Home Secretary Douglas Hurd requested a report on the investigation from Essex Chief Constable Robert Bunyard, and in March 1989 issued a statement in the House of Commons: [...] "It is clear that errors were made {{in the early stages of}} the police investigation contrary to existing force practice." ...|$|E

500|$|Kutzer {{thinks the}} tale has a [...] "nightmarish quality". Poor Mrs. Tittlemouse cannot keep {{one step ahead}} of the various intruders. Although the house is her own, she has no control over who inhabits it: she finds bees nesting in an empty {{storeroom}} and woodlice hiding in the plate rack. She is trapped in her own home, her hours occupied with fighting off invaders from without to the point where she is sure she will [...] "go distracted". Although Mr. Jackson drives the unwanted intruders away, he leaves behind <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> <b>of</b> honey smears, moss, thistledown, and dirty footprints that Mrs. Tittlemouse invests two weeks of her life into cleaning up.|$|E
500|$|Beitchman notes that, {{throughout}} his life, Tzara used Symbolist elements against the doctrines of Symbolism. Thus, he argues, the poet did not cultivate {{a memory of}} historical events, [...] "since it deludes man into thinking {{that there was something}} when there was nothing." [...] Cernat notes: [...] "That which essentially unifies, during , the poetic output of Adrian Maniu, Ion Vinea and Tristan Tzara is an acute awareness of literary conventions, a satiety [...] in respect to calophile literature, which they perceived as exhausted." [...] In Beitchman's view, the revolt against cultivated beauty was a constant in Tzara's years of maturity, and his visions of social change continued to be inspired by Arthur Rimbaud and the Comte de Lautréamont. According to Beitchman, Tzara uses the Symbolist message, [...] "the birthright [...] has been sold for <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> <b>of</b> porridge", taking it [...] "into the streets, cabarets and trains where he denounces the deal and asks for his birthright back." ...|$|E
500|$|At 22:00 on 6 August, von Funck {{reported}} that his troops were still not concentrated, and {{the commander of}} the 116th Panzer Division [...] "had made <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> <b>of</b> things". In fact, this officer (Gerhard von Schwerin) had been so pessimistic about the operation that he had not even ordered his tank units to take part. This delay disjointed the German attack, but on the German left flank, the SS Panzer troops attacked the positions of the American 30th Infantry Division east of Mortain shortly after midnight. The Germans achieved temporary surprise, as the Ultra documents had arrived at U.S. First Army Headquarters too late to alert the troops to the immediate assault. They briefly captured Mortain but were unable to breach the lines of the 30th Division, as the 2nd Battalion of the 120th Infantry Regiment commanded Hill 314, the dominant feature around Mortain. Although cut off, they were supplied by parachute drops. Of the 700 men who defended the position until 12 August, over 300 were killed.|$|E

500|$|Janet Maslin of The New York Times called most of Surf Ninjas [...] "only mindlessly watchable" [...] {{and called}} the film [...] "another of Hollywood's efforts {{to prove that the}} American mall mentality is at home in any corner of the globe". Maslin also found the film to lack in actual surfing content. Lynn Voedisch of the Chicago Sun-Times {{described}} Surf Ninjas as [...] "a marriage of pop icons that simply was fated to be", citing children's love for ninjas, especially the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and for the surf culture. Voedisch considered Rob Schneider's presence as comic relief unfunny, believing that Leslie Nielsen should have received more screen time as the dictator. [...] Calvin Wilson of The Kansas City Star called the film [...] "a disgrace... even by Hollywood standards", seeing it as <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> <b>of</b> child lead roles, unfunny cameo roles by Schneider and Nielsen, martial arts action, and lame jokes. [...] Wilson considered the story [...] "stale and uninspired" [...] that involved [...] "people we don't care about doing things we can't believe".|$|E
500|$|Reviewing {{the track}} for AOL Radio Blog, Voerding wrote [...] "Michele's voice {{is among the}} cast's most versatile, striding {{confidently}} through growls and whispers, proclamations and wavering cries. This single, with the drive of its melody and narrative, is no exception." [...] Kirsten Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called Michele's voice on the song [...] "phenomenal," [...] and commented [...] "I love how her vocals are reined in, and then build up to that wonderful glory note. I seriously got chills while listening to it." [...] She also commented how the song's narrative fit Michele's storyline on the show. Christopher Rosen of Movieline wrote [...] "If you love Lea Michele’s voice, you’ll like [...] "Get It Right." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator said [...] "This one, compared to the instantly catchy “Loser Like Me”, {{is a bit more}} underwhelming, though Lea kills it." [...] Jarret Wieselman of The New York Post said [...] "Lea Michele's voice was on point throughout this soaring ballad, but without that secret ingredient, lyrics like [...] "my best intentions keep making <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> <b>of</b> things" [...] are best left to Rachel's diary." [...] Although she called it [...] "boring" [...] and said it was like every other reflection-ballad performed by Michele, Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone said that the song would fit in on Top 40 radio. Melinda Newman of HitFix said the song was [...] "lovely, but a bit dull." ...|$|E
