40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> Internet technology {{and on the}} question whether there are monopolistic bottlenecks in Internet services which justify regulatory intervention into the market. The analysis is prompted by a discussion which followed the MCI and Worldcom merger in 1998. In this discussion it was often claimed that top-level ISPs have market power, due to their high market shares in backbone traffic and backbone connectivity. The paper proposes a separate <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Internet, which could be <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> monopolistic bottlenecks in Internet services markets and <b>the</b> network effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Internet, {{which could lead to}} strategic actions in Internet interconnection agreements.

50|$|A lack of {{historical}} records limits a quantitative <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> associated with constructing the bridge. Still, comparing {{the bridge to}} a similar structure like Roebling's Covington-Cincinnati Bridge and Gisclard's Cassagne Bridge in France provides qualitative insights. By virtue of scale, the l'Anglais Bridge requires less building material than the Covington-Cincinnati Bridge and thus probably cost less. The former spans {{a third of the}} latter's 322 m (1,057 ft). In addition, the l'Anglais Bridge did not require a main parabolic suspension cable because its innovative cable system provided more stiffness. Therefore, even if Roebling's structure were on the same scale as the l'Anglais Bridge, his design required more materials to make the parabolic cables on top of the trussed bridge deck and diagonal stays. Moreover, Gisclard's Cassagne Bridge, which spans 253 m (830.0 ft), is almost on scale with Roebling's Covington-Cincinnati Bridge in length and still manages to remove its main parabolic cables. This suggests that the design of Gisclard's cable system itself may reduce costs because it avoids the construction of large parabolic cables.|$|E

He was the principal author of the first evaluation of energy end-uses and energy efficiency potential in the U.S. economy (published by the Electronics Research Laboratory, University of California at Berkeley in 1971). He was also the principal author of the first overview study on Energy and Agriculture in the Third World (Ballinger 1975). He was one of the principal technical staff of the Ford Foundation Energy Policy Project, and a co-author of its final report, A Time to Choose, which helped shape U.S. energy policy during the mid-to-late 1970s. He is a co-author of Investment Planning in the Electricity Sector, published by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 1976. He is also the principal author of Nuclear Power Deception (Apex Books 1999), an <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of nuclear power in the United States and a co-author and principal editor of the first global assessment of the health and environmental effects of nuclear weapons production (Nuclear Wastelands, 1995 and 2000), which was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize by MIT Press. Most recently, Makhijani has authored Carbon-Free and Nuclear-Free (RDR Books and IEER Press 2007), the first analysis of a transition to a U.S. economy based completely on renewable energy, without any use of fossil fuels or nuclear power. He has many published articles in journals such as The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and The Progressive, as well as in newspapers, including the Washington Post.
