5|$|The Erie Art Museum is the city's main art gallery, {{located in}} the Old Customshouse on State Street. Its {{collection}} has an emphasis on folk art and modern art and it hosts a popular blues and jazz concert series. The Erie Art Museum also works on public <b>art</b> <b>projects</b> {{in an effort to}} revitalize and improve the city. In 2000, the Erie Art Museum created a project entitled GoFish, similar to CowParade. 95 fiberglass fish were decorated by Erie artists and placed throughout the city. Patrons paid $3,000 for a fish and the proceeds went to Gannon University's Scholarship Fund and the Erie Public Art Endowment Fund. The Erie Art Museum created a similar public art project in 2004 that involved frogs rather than fish. In 2012, the Erie Art Museum began a project to create forty artistic and functional bike racks, designed and created by local artists. The museum's intentions are to add color and interest to downtown Erie and to promote bicycling, encouraging healthy lifestyles and environmental awareness.|$|E

From this position, I examine the ways that the <b>Art</b> <b>Project</b> re-orders and interprets the items it collects...|$|R
