5|$|A {{number of}} lessons had been {{learned from the}} 1856 {{disaster}} that allowed the Church to continue the handcart system while avoiding another disaster. Never again would a handcart company depart Florence later than July 7. The construction of the handcarts was modified to strengthen them and reduce repairs. The handcarts would now be regularly greased. <b>Arrangements</b> <b>were</b> made to replenish supplies along the route.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{a school}} {{desegregation}} suit in 1972, the court required St. Louis to accept a busing plan in 1980. Judge William L.

In 1983, an unprecedented voluntary busing plan was put into place, integrating the schools without a mandated plan being required.|$|E

5|$|A concert devoted {{solely to}} music from Final Fantasy X, titled Dreams of Zanarkand, was {{scheduled}} to be performed on October 8, 2016 in Cologne, Germany.

The concert will be performed by the WDR Orchestra, with piano by Nuss, and will feature narration of events from the game by comedian and game tester Maxi Gstettenbauer. Dreams of Zanarkand is the first European game music concert dedicated to a single game.|$|E
5|$|An {{example for}} the fission and fusion {{mechanism}} {{can be found in}} nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenases. These are membrane-bound enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a hydride ion between NAD(H) and NADP(H) in a reaction that is coupled to transmembrane proton translocation. They consist of three major functional units (I, II, and III) that can be found in different arrangement in bacteria, protozoa, and higher eukaryotes.

5|$|By the mid-1930s, Barrowclough was {{disenchanted with}} the state of New Zealand's {{military}} forces, which was in decline {{due to a lack of}} resources and the discontinuation of compulsory military training. In 1936, he encouraged the reformation of the National Defence League of New Zealand (NDL), a defence lobby group which aimed to encourage and revitalise New Zealand's defence preparations for war.

Pilots were recruited at Malindi for the last leg to India and the fleet set sail. Land was reached at Anjadip, an island frequented by ships to obtain supplies {{on their way to}} Calicut.

5|$|Giselle made 6500 francs between June and September 1841. This {{was twice}} the amount {{for the same}} time period in 1839. Grisi's salary was {{increased}} to make her the top earner among the dancers at the Opéra. Souvenirs were sold, pictures of Grisi as Giselle were printed, and sheet music <b>arrangements</b> <b>were</b> made for social dancing. The sculptor Emile Thomas made a statuette of Giselle in her Act II costume. A silk cloth was manufactured called façonné Giselle, and Madame Lainné, a milliner, sold an artificial flower called 'Giselle'. The ballet was parodied at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal in October 1841.|$|E

After the 1917 Halifax Explosion, prisoners were transferred to the 800-man Amherst Internment Camp at Amherst, Nova Scotia.

5|$|Lawrence offered Segrè {{a job as}} a {{research}} assistant—a relatively lowly position for someone who had discovered an element—for US$300 a month for six months. However, when Lawrence learned that Segrè was legally trapped in California, he reduced Segrè's salary to US$116 a month. When the regents of the University of California wanted to terminate Segré's employment owing to his foreign nationality, Lawrence managed to retain Segré by hiring him as a part-time lecturer paid by the Rockefeller Foundation.

40|$|DE 102009030883 A 1 UPAB: 20110101 NOVELTY - The {{system has}} a light {{generation}} arrangement (2) comprising a light source. A sensor arrangement (4) detects position and/or orientation of a defined sub section (5) of a spatially structured and/or time-varying light structure (3). The sensor <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> fixed at a movable section. The light generation <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> designed {{such that the}} light structure is formed in a position space (O). The light generation <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> fixed at the section such that the light structure is formed relative to the section, and the sensor <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> arranged in the position space. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for determining position and/or orientation of a handling unit. USE - Positioning determining system for calibrating and/or positioning and/or measuring position/orientation of handling unit such as robot, processing unit, mounting unit, machine tool, manufacturing system, coordinate measuring device and/or automated handling equipment (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - The light generation <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> fixed at the movable section such that the light structure is formed relative to the section, and the sensor <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> arranged in the position space, thus measuring position/orientation of the handling unit in a simple and highly accurate manner without disturbing interferences...|$|R
