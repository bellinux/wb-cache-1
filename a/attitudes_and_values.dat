25|$|Adolescence marks a {{rapid change}} in one's role within a family. Young {{children}} tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship {{with his or her}} parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent–child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values. Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements. While parents never had to worry about the threats of social media in the past, it has become a dangerous place for children. While adolescents strive for their freedoms, the unknowns to parents of what their child is doing on social media sites is a challenging subject, due to the increasing amount of predators on social media sites. Many parents have very little knowledge of social networking sites {{in the first place and}} this further increases their mistrust. An important challenge for the parent–adolescent relationship is to understand how to enhance the opportunities of online communication while managing its risks. Although conflicts between children and parents increase during adolescence, these are just relatively minor issues. Regarding their important life issues, most adolescents still share the same <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>values</b> as their parents.|$|E

In this research work the attitude towards the environment of two groups {{of people living in}} suburban and urban environments is examined and categorized as biospheric, altruistic and egoistic. The data obtained from questionnaires given to participants is used for correlation studies between the environmental <b>attitudes</b> of participants <b>and</b> the higher order values they uphold. Results show that urban respondents exhibit egoistic attitudes while suburban participants who are in close contact with nature show biospheric attitudes. Significant correlations are seen between egoistic <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>value</b> of self-enhancement (0. 73) in case of urban participants <b>and</b> between biospheric <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> the <b>value</b> of self-transcendence (0. 59) for suburban participants.

2500|$|Breast cancer culture, or pink ribbon culture, is {{the set of}} activities, <b>attitudes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>values</b> that {{surround}} and shape breast cancer in public. The dominant values are selflessness, cheerfulness, unity, and optimism. [...] It is pro-doctor, pro-medicine, and pro-mammogram. Health care professionals are sources of information, but the rightness of their advice {{is not to be}} seriously questioned by women with breast cancer. Patients are not encouraged to ask where research money is going or if the research industry is making progress in finding the [...] "cure". [...] The emphasis on cheerfulness allows society to blame women for developing breast cancer and limits their responses to certain culturally determined scripts. [...] The requirement of cheerful optimism arose from the theory that cancer had a psychosomatic origin and that people who were diagnosed with cancer had a [...] "cancer personality" [...] that was depressed, repressed, and self-loathing. Psychotherapy was therefore considered an adjunct treatment used to produce a cheerful, self-affirming identity. This theory was predominant among psychiatrists through the 1970s, but has since been discredited. [...] In a process called benefit finding, the she-ro uses the emotional trauma of being diagnosed with breast cancer and the suffering of extended treatment to transform herself into a stronger, happier and more sensitive person who is grateful for the opportunity to become a better person. In particular, she sees breast cancer as an opportunity to give herself permission for necessary personal growth that she felt she was prohibited from or unable to make before. Breast cancer thereby becomes a rite of passage rather than a disease, with pink ribbon culture honoring the suffering of its she-roes by selecting them based on the amount of misery they have experienced and leading women whose treatment is less painful or debilitating to feel excluded and devalued. The suffering, particularly the extended suffering of months of chemotherapy and radiation treatment, forms a metaphorical type of ordeal or rite of passage that initiates women into the inner circle of breast cancer culture.

40|$|While {{expressing their}} {{attitude}} toward an object, people sometimes deny both the proba-bility of attributes that would speak against the <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> the <b>value</b> of these attributes. We term this kind of functioning double denial. Double denial is incompatible with expectancy-value models of attitude formation. In eight studies of <b>attitudes,</b> <b>values.</b> <b>and</b> beliefs, there was clear evidence for double denial.

40|$|Teachers’ affective traits (TATs) of {{positive}} <b>attitude,</b> interaction <b>and</b> respect can enhance students’ learning. These {{are often not}} considered in evaluating teacher candidates during recruitment and interviews, which lead to discrepancies among teachers at the same school. The {{purpose of this study}} is to explore school administrators and teachers’ views on teachers’ affective traits and whether they are emphasized in recruitment protocols. The theoretical framework includes the relationships between emotions and thoughts and teachers’ behavior in class: teachers’ identity formation (feelings), belief systems (<b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>value),</b> <b>and</b> perception (interpretation). A qualitative approach using case study design was conducted in 8 private schools located in Lebanon and the UAE. Credibility, trustworthiness and ethical practice were ensured. The instruments included the researcher journal, semi-structured interviews with 8 school administrators and an on-line questionnaire for 24 teachers. Qualitative data analysis revealed inconsistencies between the information gathered from school administrators and teachers with regard to the frequency and depth with which the TATs are examined during recruitment processes. Findings indicate that school administrators examine some aspects that represent candidates’ identity formation <b>and</b> belief systems (<b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>value)</b> whereas teachers’ frames of mind influenced by past experiences are not considered although these influence the teaching process.

40|$|The {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the process of socialisation of teachers in the teaching profession. Drawing on socialisation theory the study sees the process of secondary socialisation in teacher preparation as building skills and enabling personal development. It was predicted that in the transition from the training institution to the first years of teaching, the degree of job satisfaction and commitment to teaching would be related to the degree of conflict experienced and that job satisfaction and commitment would be less for beginning teachers compared with that anticipated by trainees. Conflict was seen as appropriately measured by the difference between personal professional <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> occupational <b>values</b> one the one hand <b>and</b> the professional <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> occupational <b>values</b> perceived to be held by senior teachers on the other. Seventy-three final year trainee teachers at the Canberra College of Advanced Education and 47 beginning teachers in their first two years of teaching in Canberra primary and secondary schools, were selected as the sample. Previously validated instruments were used in a questionnaire. The findings clearly showed the existence of conflict between personal professional <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> occupational <b>values</b> <b>and</b> the perceived professional <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> occupational <b>values</b> of senior teachers. The difference in conflict between trainees and beginning teachers was small and tended to decrease. However, there was a marked increase in variance of conflict scores for women conpared to men. For women also, conflict was highly related to job satisfaction. Thc findings suggested that men tend to be more homogeneous in their adaptation to teaching and are more inclined to be satisfied and committed despite holding professional <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> occupational <b>values</b> which conflict with those of senior teachers. The study discusses some of the imlications of the findings for the training institution and the importance, particularly for women teachers, of coping with conflict in the teaching situation...|$|R
