25|$|In 1902 he was deputed to {{investigate}} the prevalence of malaria at the Customs stations along the frontier of Goa, and to devise means for removing {{the position of the}} Salt Peons who were affected by malaria in these places. During this expedition he discovered a new species of anopheline mosquito, which after identification by Major James, I.M.S., was named after him as Anopheles aitkeni. During his service he took to writing the <b>Annual</b> <b>Reports</b> <b>of</b> the Customs Department and was frequently thanked for the same. Reviewers have commented that these reports are enlivened by his witty literary touch. In {{the last two years of}} his service he was put in charge of The Sind Gazetteer.

25|$|The 1921 Convention set new {{goals for}} {{international}} efforts to stem human trafficking, primarily by giving the anti-trafficking movement further official recognition, {{as well as a}} bureaucratic apparatus to research and fight the problem. The Advisory Committee on the Traffic of Women and Children was a permanent advisory committee of the League. Its members were nine countries, and several non-governmental organizations. An important development was the implementation of a system of <b>annual</b> <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> member countries. Member countries formed their own centralized offices to track and report on trafficking of women and children. The advisory committee also worked to expand its research and intervention program beyond the United States and Europe. In 1929, a need to expand into the Near East (Asia Minor), the Middle East and Asia was acknowledged. An international conference of central authorities in Asia was planned for 1937, but no further action was taken during the late 1930s.|$|E

25|$|The various benzodiazepines {{differ in}} their {{toxicity}} since they produce varying levels of sedation in overdose. A 1993 British study of deaths during the 1980s found flurazepam and temazepam more frequently involved in drug-related deaths, causing more deaths per million prescriptions than other benzodiazepines. Flurazepam, now rarely prescribed in the United Kingdom and Australia, had the highest fatal toxicity index of any benzodiazepine (15.0), followed by temazepam (11.9), versus benzodiazepines overall (5.9), taken with or without alcohol. An Australian (1995) study found oxazepam less toxic and less sedative, and temazepam more toxic and more sedative, than most benzodiazepines in overdose. An Australian study (2004) of overdose admissions between 1987 and 2002 found alprazolam, {{which happens to be}} the most prescribed benzodiazepine in the U.S. by a large margin, to be more toxic than diazepam and other benzodiazepines. They also cited a review of the <b>Annual</b> <b>Reports</b> <b>of</b> the American Association of Poison Control Centers National Data Collection System, which showed alprazolam was involved in 34 fatal deliberate self-poisonings over 10 years (1992â€“2001), compared with 30 fatal deliberate self-poisonings involving diazepam. In a New Zealand study (2003) of 200 deaths, Zopiclone, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, had similar overdose potential as benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|The Hong Kong AIDS Foundation is a {{registered}} charitable institution which depends on funding and donations. According to the <b>annual</b> <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> year 2002â€“2005, the Foundation received funding mainly from the AIDS Trust Fund, donations and income from the seed fund. The greatest contribution in terms of monetary value comes from the seed fund, in which the capital donation came from the Hong Kong SAR Government and The Hong Kong Jockey Club. The Foundation has a continued annual trend of current expenses exceeding current income and therefore relies on the income brought by the seed fund as well as investments which contributes to surpluses {{at the end of}} March throughout the years. The top three donors were AIDS Trust Fund (æ„›æ»‹ç—…ä¿¡è¨—åŸºé‡‘å§”å“¡æœƒ), Maryknoll China Service and Levi Strauss & Co.in the year 2004â€“2005. Also, the Foundation is exempted from Hong Kong profits tax as it is {{a registered}} charitable institution. The fund is mainly spent on various projects and activities, library development, education and publicity programs and other administrative costs like salaries for full-time staff. The percentage of expenses spent on staff and allowances has remained high throughout the years â€“ 69% of the total amount of expenditure was allocated under the category of staff and allowances in the year 2005. It is Mr Stephen W.T. Liu, JP who guides and gives advises to the Finance Committee.|$|E

[...] "Connecting the Dots" [...] sought [...] "to rescue and restore the victims and prosecute the offenders" [...] of human trafficking; Smith intended it to address both trafficking within Canada and international trafficking into the country. Smith announced several dozen specific recommendations for the proposed plan, one of which was to create an office to regularly evaluate national human trafficking opposition efforts and generate <b>annual</b> <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> their findings. Other recommendations were to increase funding for organizations that support human trafficking victims; to establish safe houses for victims in every Canadian province; to increase the use of Canada's human trafficking laws by educating police, judges, and lawyers about these relatively new laws; to initiate an extensive public relations campaign on the subject; and to have the federal government coordinate its activities with provincial governments, Aboriginal leaders, NGOs, law enforcement agencies, and human trafficking survivors.|$|E
