Pharmacokinetics of cariprazine and the two clinically relevant metabolites (desmethyl- and didesmethyl-cariprazine) was evaluated in a clinical pharmacology study. Methods: This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, fixed-dose (3, 6, or 9  mg/day) study of 28 -week duration (≤ 4 -week observation, 12 -week open-label treatment, and 12 -week follow-up). Once-daily cariprazine was administered to 38 adult patients with schizophrenia. The pharmacokinetics of cariprazine, metabolites, and total <b>active</b> <b>moieties</b> (sum of cariprazine and two metabolites) was evaluated; efficacy and safety were also assessed. Results: Steady state was reached within 1 – 2  weeks for cariprazine and desmethyl-cariprazine, 4  weeks for didesmethyl-cariprazine, and 3  weeks for total <b>active</b> <b>moieties.</b> Cariprazine and desmethyl-cariprazine levels decreased > 90 % within 1  week after the last dose, didesmethyl-cariprazine decreased ~ 50 % at 1  week, and total <b>active</b> <b>moieties</b> decreased ~ 90 % within 4  weeks. Terminal half-lives of cariprazine, desmethyl-cariprazine, and didesmethyl-cariprazine ranged from 31. 6 to 68. 4, 29. 7 to 37. 5, and 314 to 446  hours, respectively. Effective half-life (calculated from time to steady state) of total <b>active</b> <b>moieties</b> was ~ 1  week. Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was 97. 4 %; 15. 8 % of patients discontinued due to adverse events. No abnormal laboratory values or major differences from baseline in extrapyramidal symptoms were observed. Conclusion: Cariprazine and its active metabolites reached steady state within 4  weeks, and exposure was dose proportional over the range of 3 – 9  mg/day.

Data were obtained from 407 patients enrolled in four Phase 1 (serial blood sampling) and three Phase 3 trials (sparse sampling), representing dosage regimens ranging from 4 mg single dose to flexible 1 - 6 mg once daily. A pharmacokinetic model with two-compartment submodels for risperidone and 9 -hydroxyrisperidone disposition and a sequential zero- and first-order absorption pathway was selected based on prior knowledge. A mixture model was incorporated due to CYP 2 D 6 polymorphism of risperidone conversion to 9 -hydroxyrisperidone. Patient characteristics tested as potential covariates were: age, sex, race, body weight, lean body mass, body mass index, creatinine clearance, liver function laboratory parameters, study, and carbamazepine comedication. The quasi-clearance of <b>active</b> <b>moiety</b> (the sum of risperidone and 9 -hydroxyrisperidone) was simulated and linear regression performed to identify significant covariates. The selected pharmacokinetic model described the plasma concentration-time profiles for risperidone and 9 -hydroxyrisperidone quite well {{and was able to}} determine each patient's phenotype. Covariates significantly affecting the pharmacokinetics were carbamazepine comedication, and study because the proportion of patients assigned to the intermediate metabolizer status decreased from single to multiple dosing while the proportion assigned to extensive metabolizer status increased.

40|$|Objective We {{sought to}} unravel the {{influence}} of body weight and body mass index (BMI), both consistently reported as pharmacokinetic relevant parameters, on metabolism of risperidone in a naturalistic sample. Methods Conducting non parametrical tests we sought for correlations between plasma concentrations of RIS, 9 -OH-RIS and AM and body weight and BMI in patients out of a therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) database. Further, we stratified patients to three groups based upon BMI values and compared drug concentrations between groups. Results Although body weight failed to correlate with pharmacokinetic parameters, BMI {{was positively correlated with}} plasma concentrations of the active metabolite (9 -OH-RIS) (rs = 0. 121, p = 0. 002) and <b>active</b> <b>moiety</b> (sum of RIS + 9 -OH-RIS) (rs = 0. 128, p = 0. 001) as well as dose adjusted plasma concentrations of the <b>active</b> <b>moiety</b> (rs = 0. 08, p = 0. 04). The comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters between different BMI groups yielded lower plasma concentrations of 9 -OH-RIS in patients with low BMI (BMI ≥ 20 kg/m 2). By comparing low vs. high BMI patients, the latter group showed higher 9 -OH-RIS plasma concentrations. Conclusions and limitations Considerable alterations in metabolism of risperidone were detected when comparing obese and cachectic patients with the control group in alignment with the positive correlation between BMI values and plasma concentrations of the active metabolite and <b>active</b> <b>moiety</b> as well as dose adjusted plasma concentrations of the <b>active</b> <b>moiety.</b> We suggest changes in CYP 2 D 6 or CYP 3 A 4 activity or differences in P-glycoprotein function in obese patients with greater BMI as a plausible mechanism underlying these alterations...|$|E
