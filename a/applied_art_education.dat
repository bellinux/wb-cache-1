40|$|The House of I. Ideology and Theory in the Netherlands' Design Education {{is based}} on the {{hypothesis}} that Dutch Art Academies, which since the emergence of (<b>applied)</b> <b>art</b> <b>education</b> have focused expressly on training the professional artist type - in stead of a focus on the dependent artist type (the artisan) or the distanced artist type (the bohemien) - have used and/or developed forms of theory that are relevant for the current and future design education. The hypothesis is examined for Dutch art schools of Amsterdam, Arnhem, Breda, The Hague, Eindhoven, Maastricht, Rotterdam and Utrecht between 1921 and the present. Where relevant, information about the academies of Den Bosch, Enschede, Groningen and Tilburg has been added. The tree artist types and the various forms of theory are examined in the boardrooms of the art school and in the classrooms and workplaces for education in graphic, product and fashion design.

He {{received}} a diploma in accounting, but soon after receiving it he enrolled at an <b>applied</b> <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> program at the Industrial Artistic Museum in Rome, where he learned metal engraving. He also travelled to Naples, Athens and Istanbul to learn more. He was a proponent of the ideas of William Morris, and like Morris believed in the need to restore craftsmanship and quality to visual art, ornamentation and design. Cambellotti was also drawn to the visual vocabulary of Art Nouveau. He produced illustrations in that style for magazines, books and newspapers, and his furniture design (he was known for [...] "Cambellotti lamps" [...] and tables) is considered emblematic of Art Nouveau concepts. His gifts were recognized and his illustrations of Dante's Divine Comedy won the Alinari Prize in 1901 {{while he was still}} in his twenties. He discovered theater production and set design a few years later and quickly established a name for himself in that area as well. Yet another medium he that suited his sensibility and talents was stained glass, and from 1910 into the 1920s he exhibited notable stained glass works, in addition to being one of the organizers for the shows themselves.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{designed}} to reconsider art therapy {{through the lens of}} a well educated and newly experienced art educator. It follows the relationship between <b>art</b> <b>education</b> and <b>art</b> therapy as they evolve, following largely separate paths over time, to develop a conversation that will begin to examine how art therapy has been <b>applied</b> to <b>art</b> <b>education</b> in the past, and to offer possible suggestions for further research in several overlapping points of study. I use a critical pedagogy framework and a generic qualitative research methodology as I conduct my research to develop ideas and raise questions that I feel have the potential to improve my pedagogical strategies and to open up a new set of possibilities for other art educators as to how art therapy might be reconsidered. The main research question that this inquiry explores is how can art therapy inform an <b>art</b> <b>education</b> curriculum?

40|$|Master of EducationThis thesis {{examines}} {{aspects of}} the theories of Pierre Bourdieu as they <b>apply</b> to <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> The study investigates whether Bourdieu's theories are supported by the real life histories of teachers and students. The research utilises the life history approach to investigate three factors which Bourdieu argues are significant in determining a student's chances of success in <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> The three factors are the socio-economic background of the student, {{the way in which}} <b>art</b> <b>education</b> tends to construct correct ways of making art and viewing art, and the values of art and schooling as reproduced through the family. This thesis shows how complex the structures are which construct what is taught in schools, and argues that altering the way teachers teach art does not necessarily alter what is valued by the teacher within the art classroom. The thesis discusses the way boundaries are constructed for students and that these boundaries influence the way students make and talk about art. This thesis argues, therefore, that for students to be successful within <b>art</b> <b>education</b> they must adhere to the parameters set by the teachers and the school.

40|$|The use of {{economic}} analysis (EA) in crime and justice research {{has increased in}} recent years from the need to quantify the effectiveness and efficiency of interventions and policies. The New Welfare Economics model pursues an economic decision rule known as the Kaldor-Hicks criterion. This rule forms the underlying rationale for cost-benefit analysis (CBA). In short, CBA is used to evaluate options (e. g., interventions, programs, or policies) by comparing the total benefits with the total costs of the respective options. Results of EA assist in informing policy on the economic feasibility of the options in question. This entry briefly summarizes the underlying conceptual foundations of CBA and why CBAs are important to policy decision-making from a societal perspective. To illustrate the use of CBA, this entry provides two examples of CBAs conducted of third-party policing interventions highlighting potential limitations of the <b>applied</b> method. <b>Arts,</b> <b>Education</b> & Law Group, School of Criminology and Criminal JusticeNo Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{started from}} a personal realization of how the stories of “Comfort Women” are rarely discussed in society or shared internationally. This led to me to considering my role as a woman, educator and researcher who is studying at an international institute outside of Korea in relation to this issue. I contemplated how I could best contribute to the field, and then I became involved with the Heeum Museum of Military Sexual Slavery by Japan. This Museum exemplifies public participation and social activism at a grassroots level. Meeting with staff at the Heeum Museum shifted my research to become a case study and participatory action research to create a sustainable education program for the Museum, integrating <b>art</b> <b>education</b> theory and practice. I approached the Heeum Museum to enhance how it could operate in ways that contribute to a broader pedagogic understanding by: (a) developing a workshop program to engage {{the general public and}} raise awareness about this historical tragedy; (b) adopting a strategic approach to provoke empathic learning; (c) cultivating an educational approach that takes into account the realities of this history in ways that contemporary audiences can make meaningful; and (d) shifting the parameters of <b>art</b> <b>education</b> towards history and social justice education due to the unique and sensitive nature of this collection. Fostering a learning environment with strategic empathy through arts-based experience as a pivot of the workshop, this research: (a) brought a focus on caring and hope towards “Comfort Women;” (b) suggested an educational approach towards the “Comfort Women” issue; (c) demonstrated an example of arts-based experience for museum education as public pedagogy; and (d) provided an interactive cooperation model through PAR.

40|$|Lawyers have {{traditionally}} viewed {{law as a}} closed system, and doctrinal research has been the research methodology used most widely in the profession. This reflects traditional concepts of legal reasoning. There is a wealth of reliable and valid social science data available to lawyers and judges.
