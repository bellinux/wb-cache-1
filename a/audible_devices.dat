5000|$|Bite alarms: {{electronic}} devices which bleep when a fish tugs a fishing line. The fishing line is wound on a running roller {{which makes a}} noise when the fishing line moves, thus alerting the angler that a fish might be hooked. They {{are attached to the}} fishing rod between the reel and the first eye on the rod, and give an audibly alert when there is a simple movement of the line. Bite alarms can range from simple devices with an on/off switch that do no more than indicate when the line moves over the roller, to more complicated devices with volume, tone and sensitivity controls. They are useful when fishing with more than one rod, and are commonly used when coarse fishing for carp. Whereas floats can be used as visual bite detectors, bite alarms are audible bite detectors. Although more expensive than visual devices, <b>audible</b> <b>devices</b> are popular as they do not require constant monitoring. They were invented by Richard Walker.|$|E
50|$|A bell box is an <b>audible</b> <b>device,</b> often electric, which when activated, emits a chime, bell, or buzzer sound.|$|R

5000|$|A train whistle or {{air whistle}} (originally {{referred}} to as a steam trumpet) is an <b>audible</b> signaling <b>device</b> on a steam locomotive used to warn that the train is approaching, and to communicate with rail workers. Modern locomotives primarily use a powerful air horn instead of a whistle as an <b>audible</b> warning <b>device.</b> However, whistle continues to be used by railroaders in the context of audible signaling, such as [...] "whistling off" [...] when a train gets underway.|$|R
5000|$|Incorrect. An {{erroneous}} indication to {{an operator}} {{due to the}} malfunction or failure of an indicator (i.e., instruments, sensing <b>devices,</b> visual or <b>audible</b> warning <b>devices,</b> etc.).|$|R
50|$|Items legally {{required}} in some jurisdictions, or voluntarily adopted for safety reasons, include bicycle helmets, generator or battery operated lights, reflectors, and <b>audible</b> signalling <b>devices</b> {{such as a}} bell or horn. Extras include studded tires and a bicycle computer.|$|R
50|$|Under UK Construction and Use Regulations, {{competition}} machines {{intended for}} road-use {{were required to}} comply with statutory basics of sound engineering, a test certificate, mudguards, seat, <b>audible</b> warning <b>device</b> and number plate. Lighting was not required, but if fitted had to be complete and working.|$|R
5000|$|John Holliday {{describes}} {{the history of}} train whistles as originating in 1832, {{by way of a}} stationmaster at the Leicester and Swannington Railway opening, who suggested that the trains should have an <b>audible</b> signaling <b>device.</b> A local musical instrument builder was commissioned to provide a steam-powered whistle, then known as a [...] "steam trumpet".|$|R
2500|$|A train horn is a {{powerful}} air horn that serves as an <b>audible</b> warning <b>device</b> on electric and Diesel locomotives. [...] The horn's primary purpose is to alert persons and animals to an oncoming train, especially when approaching a grade crossing. The horn is also used for acknowledging signals given by railroad employees, such as during switching operations.|$|R
50|$|Today {{known as}} audible track warning signals, or <b>audible</b> track warning <b>devices,</b> {{detonators}} {{are used to}} attract the attention of train crews when track repairs or an obstruction are ahead, or when a hand signaller is acting for a signal.|$|R
50|$|In large buildings, {{a central}} fire alarm {{annunciator}} panel is located {{where it is}} accessible to fire-fighting crews. The annunciator panel will indicate the zone and approximate physical location {{of the source of}} a fire alarm in the building. The annunciator will also include lamps and <b>audible</b> warning <b>devices</b> to indicate failures of alarm circuits. In a large building such as an office tower or hotel, the fire annunciator may also be associated with a control panel for building ventilation systems, and may also include emergency communication systems for the building.|$|R
5000|$|P. R. Mallory and Co Inc was a US {{producer}} of dry cell batteries (Mercury; alkaline Duracell), electronic components including electrolytic capacitors, and <b>audible</b> warning <b>devices</b> ("Sonalert"), {{it also was}} the parent firm of Mallory Batteries Ltd., an Irish {{producer of}} Ever Ready batteries. British Ever Ready had a sizable stake in it by World War II and had {{a close relationship with}} Mallory by the late 1960s. In the US, [...] "Eveready" [...] batteries were a trademark of Union Carbide, which had no relationship with P. R. Mallory.|$|R
5000|$|A horn is a sound-making {{device that}} can be {{equipped}} to motor vehicles, buses, bicycles, trains, trams (a.k.a. streetcars in North America), {{and other types of}} vehicles. The sound made usually resembles a [...] "honk". The vehicle operator uses the horn to warn others of the vehicle's approach or presence, or to call attention to some hazard. Motor vehicles, ships and trains are required by law in some countries to have horns. Like trams, trolley cars and streetcars, bicycles are also legally required to have an <b>audible</b> warning <b>device</b> in many areas, but not universally, and not always a horn.|$|R
5000|$|On 17 October 2016, Charged Hong Kong Tesla Owners Representative Locky Law voices his {{concerns}} in the latest South China Morning Post SCMP article over the installation of <b>audible</b> warning <b>device</b> on EVs as requested by the visually-impaired. He said EV owners [...] "would not oppose to installing a beeper if carmakers sought to use the device to address blind people’s concerns," [...] but [...] "the best approach was to conduct joint tests on Hong Kong streets with participation from representatives from blind {{groups as well as}} the government, academic experts and automakers to determine what noise standards would be suitable locally." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} balance monitor and alarm system {{developed}} at NASA Ames Research Center will produce several beneficial results. The costs of wind tunnel delays because of inadvertent balance damage {{and the costs of}} balance repair or replacement can be greatly reduced or eliminated with better real-time information on the balance static and dynamic loading. The wind tunnel itself will have enhanced utility with the elimination of overly cautious limits on test conditions. The microprocessor-based system features automatic scaling and 16 multicolored LED bargraphs to indicate both static and dynamic components of the signals from eight individual channels. Five individually programmable alarm levels are available with relay closures for internal or external visual and <b>audible</b> warning <b>devices</b> and other functions such as automatic activation of external recording devices, model positioning mechanism, or tunnel shutdown...|$|R
5000|$|Error codes were {{displayed}} on a two-digit seven-segment display (one of the first seen, and built with lamps rather than LEDs). The range of error codes included not only decimal and hexadecimal digits (as seven-segment displays are commonly used) but also a limited set of other letters; for example, [...] "P3" [...] {{was one of several}} printer error codes. A thick manual that came with the System/3 aided the operator in interpreting the error codes and suggested recovery procedures. The System/3 had no <b>audible</b> warning <b>device,</b> so a program that was not printing, reading cards, or causing other obvious activity could halt and the operator would not know it unless he or she happened to look at the status display. Models with the Dual Program Feature had two separate status displays.|$|R
50|$|Modern fryers {{feature a}} basket to raise food {{clear of the}} oil when cooking is finished. Fryers often come with {{features}} such as timers with an <b>audible</b> alarm, automatic <b>devices</b> to raise and lower the basket into the oil, measures to prevent food crumbs from becoming over cooked, ventilation systems to reduce frying odors, oil filters to extend the usable life of the oil, and mechanical or electronic temperature controls. Deep fryers are used for cooking many fast foods, and making them crisp.|$|R
5000|$|The company {{initially}} [...] "developed {{a way to}} use {{radio frequency}} to measure distance and used it to make security devices that people could attach to such things as briefcases or their children. If a device exceeded a certain distance from its owner," [...] it would make an <b>audible</b> alert. The <b>devices</b> sold successfully at Staples, but the founders [...] "realized that their range-estimation technology could be used to track assets indoors and decided to develop a system that took advantage of that capability." ...|$|R
40|$|Young {{children}} with visual impairments tend to engage less with their surroundings, limiting the benefits from activities at school. We investigated novel ways of using sound from a bracelet, such as speech or familiar noises, to tell children about nearby people, places and activities, to encourage them to engage more during play and help them move independently. We present a series of studies, the first two involving visual impairment educators, that give insight into challenges faced by visually impaired children at school and how sound might help them. We then present a focus group with visually impaired children that gives further insight into the effective use of sound. Our findings reveal novel ways of combining sounds from wearables with sounds from the environment, motivating <b>audible</b> beacons, <b>devices</b> for audio output and proximity estimation. We present scenarios, findings and a design space that show the novel ways such devices could be used alongside wearables to help visually impaired children at school...|$|R
5000|$|Light bars - A long but narrow 'strip' {{of lights}} {{on top of}} an {{emergency}} vehicle, which can be configured with almost infinite combinations of different lighting technologies from the list below. These are typically the main source of flashing light for the vehicle, and are used on overt marked emergency vehicles. They can also be divided into sections, with an array of functions (for instance front blue flashing lights, and rear red flashing lights, switched separately). Due {{to the nature of the}} wind resistance encountered by these large units, the majority must be fixed to the car permanently, although some units (usually smaller) are available with either magnetic or suction cup mountings which can be removed. The Light bar may also contain the <b>Audible</b> Warning <b>devices.</b> Some jurisdictions disallow the sale of lightbars to the general public (especially if mandated under state and/or federal law regardless of lens coloring which are not red and blue).|$|R
5000|$|Yodalarm - These are {{the most}} used <b>audible</b> alarm <b>devices.</b> They are found at almost every MCB type {{crossing}} in Britain. Each alarm, at each crossing, has its own unique tone (usually a high pitch bleep, followed by a lower pitched bleep). The alarms have different volumes at different crossings, depending on how busy the crossing is, and whether residents are living nearby. The alarms sound for different durations at different types of crossings. Alarms sound from the activation of the crossing to when all barriers have fully lowered at MCB type crossings, alarms sound from the activation of the crossing to when the barriers raise at AHB (half barrier) type crossings and alarms sound for the whole time the crossing is active at non-barrier (AOCL) type crossings. At AHB and some AOCL crossings, {{the tone of the}} alarm often increases its speed, to alert pedestrians and drivers that a second train is approaching.|$|R
5000|$|Electronic Bells - Bells {{are quite}} {{hard to find}} at {{crossings}} now as many {{have been replaced by}} <b>audible</b> tone alarm <b>devices.</b> They were the first audible alarm warnings for crossings in the UK. Crossings had either an intermittent bell tone, where a bell would 'ding' about every second, (still operating at crossings such as at Canterbury (Kent), Charlton Lane (Greater London) or Chilworth (Surrey)), or a continuous bell, (still operating at crossings such as [...] (Staffordshire) [...] ). The only remaining crossings with bells are MCB type crossings. However Spatham Lane crossing in East Sussex {{is one of the few}} surviving half barrier type crossings in the UK with working bells.|$|R
5000|$|Audible {{launched}} Audible Air in 2005, {{software that}} made it possible to download (copy-controlled) audio books over the air - wirelessly and directly to devices such as a smartphones or PDAs. This eliminated the need for the intermediate step of downloading copy-controlled audio books first to a computer in order to then transfer it to Palm OS, Windows Mobile, and Symbian Mobile <b>devices.</b> <b>Audible</b> Air content would update automatically, downloading chapters as required that would then delete themselves after they had been listened to. [...] Interest in Audible and its founder would continue to attract attention as Don Katz was featured in the March 2006 issue of [...] "Business 2.0".|$|R
40|$|The Energy Systems Laboratory (ESL) at Texas A&M University has {{monitored}} the real-time electrical energy consumption, demand, and power factor {{of a large}} metal fabrication plant in Houston, Texas for twelve months. Monthly reports that present the data in a format that plant personnel find useful are discussed. These reports allow plant personnel to see how power factor correction in conjunction with production retrofits have reduced utility bills despite production capacity increases. The reports have also been useful in detecting maintenance problems and monitoring productivity. A method that allows the calculation of power factor correction savings after correction is discussed. This method requires some power factor versus demand history prior to correction, and is used to determine what the demand {{would have been if}} the correction equipment had not been installed, even if the real demand of the plant changes. Major plant electrical modifications and their impact on a monitoring system are also discussed. Such modifications increase the potential for technical problems with the monitoring equipment and result in hard-to-find problems. A future step to be examined is one that uses visual or <b>audible</b> warning <b>devices</b> in the plant to control demand. At least one plant has adopted this idea in the form of warning lights that inform employees to shut down unnecessary equipment. This concept appears to be potentially beneficial to all plants which have some type of demand monitoring device on-site...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the initial {{development of an}} artificial phonological loop (APL), a new technology to assist individuals with impairment of the working memory system. The phonological loop, along with the visuospatial sketchpad, {{is one of the}} two slave short-term memory subsystems that comprise working memory, a cognitive function closely associated with the control of attention. In the phonological loop, phonological (speech) information lasting for 1 – 2 second is maintained active by repetitive, subvocal (silent speech) rehearsal. Deficits in working memory, specifically in the phonological loop, occur in many disorders, including attention-deficit disorder and Alzheimer’s disease. In these disorders, it appears that the ability for phonological rehearsal is intact, but the regulation or triggering of the rehearsal process is inadequate, thus causing the contents of working memory to be lost. The purpose, then, of the APL is to facilitate the phonological loop by artificially extending the duration of phonological rehearsals. The APL mimics the natural phonological loop by providing audible vocal echoes {{to take the place of}} subvocal rehearsals. In this system, the user talks to him/herself in short (1 – 2 second) phrases; the device records these phrases, stores them in electronic memory, and then repeats— i. e., echoes—the phrases multiple times over an extended period. Two versions of this device have been developed: the Echo-APL and the Rearticulation-APL. In the Echo-APL, only echoing is involved. In the Rearticulation-APL, however, the user re-vocalizes (rearticulates) the phrase in response to an <b>audible</b> cue. The <b>device</b> repeats the cue until it detects (hears) the re-vocalization. Future research and development of the APL will require extensive testing and careful evaluation of possible echo-schedules: the predefined program controlling inter-echo time intervals and echo-amplitude (echo loudness). The APL essentially exteriorizes the silent phonological loop and makes it audible. It is a system that helps the user to “talk to him/herself” to keep ideas in mind...|$|R
