5|$|After the {{expulsion}} of the Jesuit order from Spanish territories in 1767, most Jesuit reductions in South America were abandoned and fell into ruins. The former Jesuit missions of Chiquitos <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> because these settlements and their associated culture have survived largely intact.|$|E

25|$|Rule 3 The {{basic model}} of each column must <b>be</b> <b>unique</b> : The basic model of each column, the {{relationship}} objects {{and the structure}} of it <b>is</b> <b>unique.</b> Each relationship object is interdependent but the representation objective <b>is</b> <b>unique.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{uniqueness}} of {{solution to the}} mean-field FBSDE (consisting of the four Eqs. (1) with (X,u)=(X∗,u∗) and (6)-(8)) {{can be obtained from}} {{uniqueness of}} optimal controls. In fact, as u∗ <b>is</b> <b>unique,</b> the corresponding state process X∗ <b>is</b> <b>unique,</b> and thus the solution (p,k) to the adjoint equation <b>is</b> <b>unique.</b>|$|R
5|$|Fire ants, Solenopsis spp., <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> {{in having}} a venom sac {{containing}} piperidine alkaloids. Their stings are painful and can be dangerous to hypersensitive people.|$|E

5|$|Vocal {{differences}} reinforce species {{separation between}} closely related birds {{such as the}} least and little terns, and can help humans distinguish similar species, such as common and Arctic terns, since flight calls <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> to each species.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} version of the theorem, evidently the {{separating}} hyperplane <b>is</b> never <b>unique.</b> In the second version, {{it may or may not}} <b>be</b> <b>unique.</b> Technically a separating axis <b>is</b> never <b>unique</b> because it can be translated; in the second version of the theorem, a separating axis can <b>be</b> <b>unique</b> up to translation.|$|R
5000|$|If a Bayes rule <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> then it <b>is</b> admissible. For example, {{as stated}} above, under {{mean squared error}} (MSE) the Bayes rule <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> and {{therefore}} admissible.|$|R
50|$|Identifiers in VDEX data should <b>be</b> persistent, <b>unique,</b> resolvable, {{transportable}} and URI-compliant. Specifically, vocabulary identifiers should <b>be</b> <b>unique</b> URIs, whereas {{term and}} relationship identifiers should <b>be</b> locally <b>unique</b> strings.|$|R
5|$|An {{individual}} {{killer whale}} {{can often be}} identified from its dorsal fin and saddle patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin and the pattern of white or grey in the saddle patch <b>are</b> <b>unique.</b> Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into lifecycles and social structures.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{there is}} a {{divergence}} in the classical sources as to the course of events which cannot be reconciled until the entry of Marcus Licinius Crassus into the war. The two most comprehensive (extant) histories of the war by Appian and Plutarch detail very different events. However, neither account directly contradicts the other, but simply reports different events, ignoring some events in the other account, and reporting events that <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> to that account.|$|E
5|$|Blizzard Entertainment's use {{of three}} {{distinct}} races in StarCraft is widely credited with revolutionizing the real-time strategy genre. All units <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> {{to their respective}} races and while rough comparisons can be drawn between certain types of units in the technology tree, every unit performs differently and requires different tactics for a player to succeed.|$|E
50|$|More over, this {{decomposition}} <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> in {{the following}} sense: the set of associated prime ideals <b>is</b> <b>unique,</b> and the primary ideal above every minimal prime in this set <b>is</b> also <b>unique.</b> However, primary ideals which are associated with non-minimal prime ideals are in general not unique.|$|R
30|$|The {{center and}} the radius of the circumball <b>is</b> <b>unique,</b> but for the inball, the radius <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> but the center may not <b>be</b> <b>unique.</b> For example, the {{rectangle}} with vertices (- 2,- 1), (2,- 1), (- 2, 1) and (2, 1), any point belongs to the line segment on the x-axis between (- 1, 0) and (1, 0) can be a center for an inball.|$|R

5|$|Captive {{killer whale}} lifespans are {{typically}} significantly shorter, usually less than 25 years; however, numerous individuals are alive in their 30s, {{and a few}} have reached their 40s. Killer whales <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> among cetaceans, as their heads become relatively shorter as they age, i.e., the orca's caudal section enlongates more-so relative to its head.|$|E
5|$|Departure {{times for}} these flights as {{specified}} during booking are by definition approximate, with the settlement service optimised {{on the fly}} depending on local demand for a given day. Settlement flights in the Disko Bay region <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> {{in that they are}} operated only during winter and spring. During summer and autumn, transport between settlements is only by sea, with services operated by Diskoline, a government-contracted ferry service based in Ilulissat.|$|E
5|$|Grown {{males are}} known to enter {{surprisingly}} shallow bays to rest (whales will be in state of rest during these occasions). There <b>are</b> <b>unique,</b> coastal groups reported from various areas among the globe such as Scotland, Shiretoko Peninsula, off Kaikoura, in Davao Gulf. Such coastal groups were more abundant in pre-whaling days.|$|E
50|$|The {{province}} code <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> and <b>is</b> {{independent of}} the region code. All PSGCs, <b>are</b> therefore, <b>unique.</b>|$|R
50|$|The ID {{card number}} <b>is</b> not <b>unique</b> and changes {{if the person}} gets a new {{identity}} card. The tax identity number <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> for every citizen and company. Social security number <b>is</b> also <b>unique.</b>|$|R
50|$|Given an {{embedding}} of a manifold in Euclidean space (provided by the theorem of Whitney), it has {{a normal}} bundle. The embedding <b>is</b> not <b>unique,</b> but for high dimension of the Euclidean space it <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> up to isotopy, thus the (class of the) bundle <b>is</b> <b>unique,</b> and called the stable normal bundle.|$|R
5|$|Many {{families}} of moths have special organs to help detect bat echolocation. These organs {{are known as}} tympana (singular – typanum). The Pyraloidea and almost all Geometroidea have tympana located on the anterior sternite of the abdomen. The Noctuoidea also have tympana, but in their case, the tympana are located {{on the underside of}} the metathorax, the structure and position of which <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> and a taxonomic distinguishing feature of the superfamily.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa uses {{a set of}} demonstrative pronouns that {{contains}} terms unique to Ottawa, while other words in the set are shared with other Ojibwe dialects. Taken as a group the Ottawa set is distinctive. The following chart shows the demonstrative pronouns for: (a) Wikwemikong, an Ottawa community; (b) Curve Lake, an Eastern Ojibwe community; and (c) Cape Croker, an Ottawa community that uses a mixed pronoun set. The terms maaba 'this (animate)', gonda 'these (animate)', and nonda 'these (inanimate)' <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> to Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|Sebum, {{secreted}} by the {{sebaceous gland}} in humans, is primarily composed of triglycerides (~41%), wax esters (~26%), squalene (~12%), and {{free fatty acids}} (~16%). The composition of sebum varies across species. Wax esters and squalene <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> to sebum and not produced as final products {{anywhere else in the}} body. Sapienic acid is a sebum fatty acid that is unique to humans, and is implicated in the development of acne. Sebum is odorless, but its breakdown by bacteria can produce strong odors.|$|E

Lava tube beetles and many other cave animals are found only in the lava tubes of eastern Idaho.|$|E

Some of these <b>are</b> <b>unique</b> to single-track vehicles, while others are also experienced by automobiles.
