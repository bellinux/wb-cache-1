5|$|All Upanishads are {{associated}} {{with one of the}} four Vedas—Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda (there are two primary versions or Samhitas of the Yajurveda: Shukla Yajurveda, Krishna Yajurveda), and Atharvaveda. During the modern era, the ancient Upanishads that were embedded texts in the Vedas, were detached from the Brahmana and Aranyaka layers of Vedic text, compiled into separate texts and these were then gathered into anthologies of Upanishads. These lists associated each Upanishad with one of the four Vedas, many such lists exist, and these lists are inconsistent across India in terms of which Upanishads are included and how the newer Upanishads are assigned to the ancient Vedas. In south India, the collected list based on Muktika Upanishad, and published in Telugu language, became the most common by the 19th-century <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> list of 108 Upanishads. In north India, a list of 52 Upanishads has been most common.|$|E

25|$|When a {{classical}} particle is weakly coupled to a radiation field, {{so that the}} radiative damping can be neglected, it will emit radiation in a pattern which repeats itself every orbital period.

25|$|Consecration to the Blessed Virgin Mary: Our members consecrate {{themselves}} to the Blessed Virgin Mary every year on the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception, December 8th. We have a yearly novena to our Lady under this title, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> solemnity proper to our Congregation. The original Constitutions drawn up by Father Rauzan affirmed the belief that one goes surely to Jesus through Mary. Placing ourselves under the patronage of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we profess our Final/Perpetual Vows on August 15th, the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, {{and we try to}} schedule all of our Ordinations on a Marian feast day.|$|E
25|$|Attitude {{formation}} can {{be based}} on facts where a rational approach is taken, weighing up the pros and cons. A lot of the time, however, we acquire our attitudes from our parents, friends, and surrounding culture {{through a variety of}} learning mechanisms. is a somewhat disturbing example of this. Marketers have long been aware of the influence of peers on attitudes <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> particularly important concept for subcultures which are socially oriented and experienced based. Participants communicate via many means and move between geographic locations. An example of a subculture is straight edge and their consumption is therefore affected by the socially constructed attitudes of the subgroup.|$|E

Nicklaus has the third most PGA Tour {{victories}} with 73, behind Sam Snead (82) and Tiger Woods (79). Nicklaus also holds {{the record for}} the most wins at the Masters with six, and The Players Championship with three. He played on six Ryder Cup teams, captained the team twice and the Presidents Cup team four times, and topped the PGA Tour money list and scoring average eight times each. For 24 straight seasons, from 1960 to 1983 inclusive, he made at least one top ten finish in a major championship, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> record.|$|E

25|$|But now {{suppose that}} the {{electrons}} in the experiment are subject to electric or magnetic fields. For example, if an electric field was imposed {{on one side of}} the axis but not on the other, the results of the experiment would be affected. The part of the electron wave passing through that side oscillates at a different rate, since its energy has had −eV added to it, where −e is the charge of the electron and V the electrical potential. The results of the experiment will be different, because phase relationships between the two parts of the electron wave have changed, and therefore the locations of constructive and destructive interference will be shifted to one side or the other. It is the electric potential that occurs here, not the electric field, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> manifestation of the fact that it is the potentials and not the fields that are of fundamental significance in quantum mechanics.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} {{circumstances}} where the courts accept that procedural protections {{should be more}} limited or even placed in abeyance, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> function of context. This is especially so in matters of national security where the sensitivity of such matters demands that the courts do not look closely at government decisions to limit procedural rights. In wartime, the case of Liversidge v. Anderson (1941) is regarded to be of great constitutional significance. The House of Lords found {{that there could be}} no inquiry into whether there were reasonable grounds for the detention of the appellant as it was a subjective matter for the Home Security to determine, as prescribed by legislation. However, in Lord Atkin's acclaimed dissenting judgment, he refused to endorse this construction of the law. Lord Atkin's judgment is now taken as the correct decision, where every imprisonment is prima facie illegal until justified by the arresting authority. Nonetheless, national security is still an important issue that can and does limit procedural protection in certain cases.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of Congress on the presidency has varied from period to period depending on {{factors such as}} congressional leadership, presidential political influence, historical circumstances such as war, and individual initiative by members of Congress. The impeachment of Andrew Johnson made the presidency less powerful than Congress for a considerable period afterwards. The 20th and 21st centuries have seen the rise of presidential power under politicians such as Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush. However, in recent years, Congress has restricted presidential power with laws such as the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and the War Powers Resolution. Nevertheless, the Presidency remains considerably more powerful today than during the 19th century. Executive branch officials are often loath to reveal sensitive information to members of Congress because of concern that information could not be kept secret; in return, knowing they {{may be in the}} dark about executive branch activity, congressional officials are more likely to distrust their counterparts in executive agencies. Many government actions require fast coordinated effort by many agencies, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> task that Congress is ill-suited for. Congress is slow, open, divided, and not well matched to handle more rapid executive action or {{do a good job of}} overseeing such activity, according to one analysis.|$|E

500|$|The skin {{along the}} middle of the dorsal side is folded in, and covered with [...] white hair erected by arrector pili muscles (located between hair follicles). This white hair is almost fully {{concealed}} by the surrounding brown hairs until the fold opens up, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> major feature distinguishing this antelope from gazelles. Springbok differ from gazelles in several other ways; for instance, springbok have two premolars on both sides of either jaw, rather than the three observed in gazelles. This gives a total of 28 teeth in the springbok, rather than 32 of gazelles. Other points of difference include a longer, broader, and rigid bridge to the nose and more muscular cheeks in springbok, and differences {{in the structure of the}} horns.|$|E
500|$|Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier/Lord Caldlow (The Great Danton), {{an aristocratic}} magician. After reading the script, Jackman {{expressed}} interest in playing the part. Christopher Nolan discovered Jackman {{was interested in the}} script, and after meeting him saw that Jackman possessed the qualities of stage showmanship that Nolan was looking for in the role of Angier. Nolan explained that Angier had a [...] "wonderful understanding of the interaction between a performer and a live audience", a quality he believed that Jackman had. Nolan said that Jackman [...] "has the great depth as an actor that hasn't really been explored. People haven't had the chance to really see what he can do as an actor, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> character that would let him do that." [...] Jackman based his portrayal of Angier on 1950s-era American magician Channing Pollock. Jackman also portrays Gerald Root, an alcoholic double used for Angier's New Transported Man.|$|E
