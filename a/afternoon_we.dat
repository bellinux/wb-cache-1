It was quite moving at the end and {{to tell you the truth}} my eyes were a bit damp").|$|E
500|$|Her Jewish {{upbringing}} {{was influenced}} by her devoutly Orthodox Jewish maternal grandmother. Barr's parents kept their Jewish heritage secret from their neighbors and were partially involved in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Barr has stated, [...] "Friday, Saturday, and Sunday morning I was a Jew; Sunday afternoon, Tuesday afternoon, and Wednesday <b>afternoon</b> <b>we</b> were Mormons". [...] When Barr was three years old, she got Bell's palsy {{on the left side}} of her face. Barr said, [...] " [...] my mother called in a rabbi to pray for me, but nothing happened. Then my mother got a Mormon preacher, he prayed, and I was miraculously cured". Years later Barr learned that Bell's palsy was usually temporary and that the Mormon preacher came [...] "exactly at the right time". [...] At six years old, Barr discovered her first public stage by lecturing at LDS churches around Utah and even was elected president of a Mormon youth group.|$|E
500|$|However, he {{eventually}} beat 5,000 other hopefuls to land his breakout role opposite Stallone, Carl Weathers and Brigitte Nielsen. To improve his physique and athletic abilities {{for the role}} of Drago, he trained intensely in bodybuilding and boxing for five months before the film was shot. Lundgren said, [...] "We trained six days a week—weights in the morning for about an hour, then boxing in the <b>afternoon.</b> <b>We</b> did a split of chest and back one day and then shoulders, legs, and arms the next. We boxed {{for an hour and a}} half, practiced the fight choreography, and did bag work and abs." [...] He weighed [...] – [...] during the filming, but in the film he was billed at one publisher said of Drago, [...] "He's a hulking 261pounds of merciless fighting machine, the best that Soviet science & medicine can create". His lines [...] "If he dies, he dies" [...] and [...] "I must break you" [...] are amongst the best known of the Rocky series and have been cited in popular culture.|$|E

60|$|We {{had some}} horsemanship drill every forenoon; then, <b>afternoons,</b> <b>we</b> rode off {{here and there}} in squads a few miles, and visited the farmers' girls, and had a {{youthful}} good time, and got an honest good dinner or supper, and then home again to camp, happy and content.|$|R
6000|$|... "We had a {{great deal}} of liberty--more liberty, perhaps, than our friends would have {{approved}} of. We worked, it is true, in the mornings, but in the <b>afternoons</b> <b>we</b> rode or played tennis in the Bois. It was there that I met Prince Frederick, who afterwards became my husband.|$|R
500|$|The school’s {{refusal to}} play Ward in the Georgia Tech game later {{became part of}} the public legacy of President Gerald R. Ford. Ward {{recalled}} that he met “my man Jerry” during freshman orientation in 1932, and the two became friends and roommates when the football team traveled for road games. When Ford learned that the school had capitulated to Georgia Tech, some accounts indicate that he [...] "quit the team" [...] or threatened to quit in order [...] "to make a statement and take a stand because Willis Ward was his friend." [...] Ford wrote about the Georgia Tech incident in his autobiography, recalling that he felt the decision to keep Willis out of the game was [...] "morally wrong." [...] “I went to Willis himself. He urged me to play. [...] ‘Look,’ he said, ‘the team’s having a bad year. We’ve lost two games already and we probably won’t win any more. You’ve got to play Saturday. You owe it to the team.’ [...] I decided he was right. That Saturday <b>afternoon,</b> <b>we</b> hit like never before and beat Georgia Tech 9–2.” [...] Years later, Ford wrote that the Ward incident had influenced his thinking about race. Ford noted: “His sacrifice led me to question how educational administrators could capitulate to raw prejudice.” [...] Ford used the story to voice his support for U-M’s affirmative action admissions policy saying, “Do we really want to risk turning back the clock to an era when the Willis Wards were isolated and penalized for the color of their skin, their economic standing or national ancestry?” ...|$|E
2500|$|Outside the courtroom, Evans {{explained}} why Carruthers {{had made the}} surprise move to shift the hearing to East Missouri. [...] "Yesterday <b>afternoon</b> <b>we</b> determined {{it would be in}} our best interests to waive our right to a detention hearing here," [...] he said. [...] "We are very optimistic that the East Missouri court can fashion some optimistic and reasonable conditions for his release." ...|$|E
2500|$|King Hussein {{declared}} {{martial law}} on 16 September and initiated the military actions later {{known as the}} Black September conflict. Hostage David Raab described the Jordanian military actions: [...] "We {{were in the middle}} of the shelling since Ashrafiyeh was among the Jordanian Army's primary targets. Electricity was cut off, and again we had little food or water. Friday <b>afternoon,</b> <b>we</b> heard the metal tracks of a tank clanking on the pavement. We were quickly herded into one room, and the guerrillas threw open the doors to make the building appear abandoned so it wouldn't attract fire. Suddenly, the shelling stopped." ...|$|E
60|$|Sometimes, on lazy <b>afternoons,</b> <b>we</b> lolled on {{the sand}} in camp, and smoked pipes and read some old well-worn novels. At night, by the camp-fire, we played euchre and seven-up to {{strengthen}} the mind--and played them with cards so greasy and defaced that only a whole summer's acquaintance with them could enable the student to tell the ace of clubs from the jack of diamonds.|$|R
5000|$|Of the show's origins, Eddie Lawrence, lyricist and librettist, {{recalled}} that: [...] "Moose Charlap {{had finished}} doing his songs for Peter Pan, starring Mary Martin, {{and a couple}} of one-acts of mine were being performed while I toured late night TV plugging my comedy album. During the <b>afternoons,</b> <b>we</b> worked on Kelly. It was a labour of love." [...] At that early stage, the show was titled Never Go There Anymore.|$|R

2500|$|Edward Shortland {{visited the}} area in 1844, coming {{overland}} from Waikouaiti. On 9 January he recorded [...] "Our path to-day was sometimes {{along the edge of}} a low cliff, sometimes along the beach, till we approached Oamaru point, where it turned inland, and crossed a low range of hills, from which we looked over an extensive plain ... Towards the <b>afternoon,</b> <b>we</b> ascended a range of hills called Pukeuri, separating this plain from another more extensive. The sky was so remarkably clear that, from the highest point of the pathway, Moeraki was distinctly in view..." [...] He made a map and placed Oamaru on it. He was one of several Europeans who passed through the area on foot in the 1840s. James Saunders became the first European resident of the district some time before 1850 when he settled to trade among the Māori of the Waitaki River mouth.|$|E

60|$|My mother consented, {{as she did}} to {{all things}} now, and so it came about that again of <b>afternoons</b> <b>we</b> climbed--though more slowly and with many pauses--the steep path to the ruined tower old Jacob in his happy foolishness had built upon the headland, rested once again upon its topmost platform, {{sheltered}} from the wind that ever blew about its crumbling walls, saw once more the distant mountains, faint like spectres, and the silent ships that came and vanished, and about our feet the pleasant farm lands, and the grave, sweet river.|$|R
