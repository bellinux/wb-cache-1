30|$|The peer-tree {{indexing}} structure {{can serve}} as a guideline for forwarding location updates and queries. When a target host represents a host whose location is under query or is being updated, a location query or update is always forwarded to the <b>closer</b> <b>friends</b> of the target host. <b>A</b> <b>closer</b> <b>friend</b> of the target host should qualify two conditions. First, the <b>closer</b> <b>friend</b> is one of the neighbors surrounding the host which currently holds a location update or query. Second, the identifier of the <b>closer</b> <b>friend</b> must share the longest suffix with the identifier of the target host. The selection of <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> <b>friend</b> can be imagined as searching in the peer-tree. The search starts at the root and moves toward the leaf node representing the identifier of the target host. The height of a peer-tree represents the maximum number of times that a location update or query can be forwarded.|$|R
