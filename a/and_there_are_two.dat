5|$|Chatteris is {{situated}} between Huntingdon, St Ives, Peterborough, March and Ely, {{in the middle}} of The Fens—the lowest-lying area in the United Kingdom—with most of the land surrounding the town being below sea level, although the highest point in the Fens (36 feet above sea level) is within Chatteris's parish boundaries. The peaty land surrounding the town is largely used for agriculture, drained by numerous ditches and dykes, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> large drainage rivers near the town – the Forty Foot Drain, also known as Vermuyden's Drain, and the Sixteen Foot Drain.|$|E

5|$|Grasshoppers {{have the}} typical insect body plan of head, thorax and abdomen. The head is held {{vertically}} {{at an angle}} to the body, with the mouth at the bottom. The head bears a large pair of compound eyes which give all-round vision, three simple eyes which can detect light and dark, and a pair of thread-like antennae that are sensitive to touch and smell. The downward-directed mouthparts are modified for chewing <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> sensory palps in front of the jaws.|$|E
5|$|Locomotion {{abilities}} are best studied for Tyrannosaurus <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> main issues concerning this: {{how well it}} could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been.Tyrannosaurus may {{have been slow to}} turn, possibly taking one to two seconds to turn only 45°– an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tail-less, can spin in a fraction of a second. The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus’ mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber.|$|E
5|$|Tourist {{accommodation}} {{ranges from}} luxury lodges to apartments and villa units. The currency is the Australian dollar, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> banks.

To protect the fragile environment of Ball's Pyramid (which carries the last remaining wild population of the endangered Howe Island stick insect), recreational climbing there is prohibited. No pets are allowed without permission from the Board. Islanders use tanked rainwater, supplemented by bore water for showers and washing clothes.|$|E

5|$|Although {{adapted to}} {{terrestrial}} life, frogs resemble freshwater fish in {{their inability to}} conserve body water effectively. When they are on land, much water is lost by evaporation from the skin. The excretory system {{is similar to that}} of mammals <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> kidneys that remove nitrogenous products from the blood. Frogs produce large quantities of dilute urine in order to flush out toxic products from the kidney tubules. The nitrogen is excreted as ammonia by tadpoles and aquatic frogs but mainly as urea, a less toxic product, by most terrestrial adults. A few species of tree frog with little access to water excrete the even less toxic uric acid. The urine passes along paired ureters to the urinary bladder from which it is vented periodically into the cloaca. All bodily wastes exit the body through the cloaca which terminates in a cloacal vent.|$|E
5|$|From the Lexington Avenue entrance, {{there are}} two short {{escalators}} and a stair from the northwest corner, a staircase from the southwest corner, and a short elevator hidden {{around the corner from}} the escalators. From the fare control, {{there are two}} long escalators and a stair to an intermediate level, and then two shorter escalators and a pair of stairs to a lower mezzanine. Here, the bank splits <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> separate tubes of two escalators and a stair each to each platform. The platform elevator has its own two turnstiles, and makes three stops (mezzanine, upper platform, lower platform).|$|E

5|$|In Panama, it breeds year-round without {{apparent}} seasonal variability. According to Omar Linares's Mamíferos de Venezuela (Mammals of Venezuela), reproductive {{activity is}} highest in June–July and December. In the laboratory, the gestation period is 28days; Linares reports {{that it is}} 20 to 30days in the wild. Females produce an average of six litters per year <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> to five (average 3.92) young per litter, so that a single female may produce about 24 young per year; this is likely an overestimate because most females would not live for a full year. Larger females may have larger litters. Animals become sexually mature when {{less than two months}} old; in Fleming's study, some females in juvenile fur, probably less than 50days old, were already pregnant. The oldest specimen Fleming observed was nine months old; he estimated that animals were unlikely to live {{for more than a year}} in the wild and that the mean age at death was 2.9months.|$|E
5|$|The Walronds was {{probably}} built in 1605 {{which is the}} date over the hall fireplace. John Peter, a lawyer, acquired the property by marriage into the Paris family and his initials are over the fireplace. The plan is a traditional one with the ground floor hall divided from the entrance passage by a screen. The main range has three storeys <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> wings which are both two storeys high. In the upper south-east room is a barrel shaped ceiling and a second fireplace with the date 1605. The association with the prominent local gentry family of Walrond of Bradfield House only dates from the eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|This {{artificial}} lake {{is connected to}} {{the east side of the}} Segaran Lake via a 380 meter long canal that runs east to west. The canal was about 20 meter wide <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> bottlenecks that are thought to be the place where a hanging bridge once stood. One of the bridge is now located in the street that connects the kraton complex of Magangan with the Kamandhungan Kidul. The layout of the bridge can still be recognized, although the bridge itself has gone. On the west side of the hanging bridge is a pier that was used by the sultan as his starting point for his journey to the Taman Sari pool on his royal vessel.|$|E
