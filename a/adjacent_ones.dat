25|$|Since {{the end of}} the First World War, {{during which}} Luxembourg was {{occupied}} by Germany, the number of communes has dropped steadily. In 1920, Luxembourg City was expanded, annexing four surrounding communes. Another wave of mergers took place in the 1970s when sparsely-populated areas in the north and west of the country were merged to form Lac de la Haute-Sûre, Rambrouch, and Wincrange. 2006 saw the creation of Kiischpelt and Tandel from four smaller communes, further reducing them to just 116. 2012 saw the creation of Käerjeng, Vallée de l'Ernz and Parc Hosingen from smaller communes, and the merger of Clervaux, Esch-sur-Sûre and Schengen into <b>adjacent</b> <b>ones.</b> With the 2015 expansion of Wiltz, there are now only 105 communes.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{becoming}} a municipality in its own right, Lares was a barrio or ward {{of the town of}} San Sebastian del Pepino. [...] The principal reason for Lares' foundation was the long and arduous travel that families residing there encountered in going to San Sebastian to attend mass and to conduct their secular business affairs. [...] According to Spanish law, any barrio that was at least three leagues distant (a league is roughly equivalent to three miles) from the nearest church and, had a least 10 vecinos (citizens who were the head of their household) could petition the central government to allow it to become a municipality, provided, there were no objections from their present municipal government and, other <b>adjacent</b> <b>ones.</b> [...] In any event, over the course of seven years the founders of Lares overcame various difficulties and the municipality of Lares came into being.|$|E

He loved once; not wisely but too well. And once only: for as your Congreve needs a new case or wrappage for every new rocket, so each human heart can properly exhibit but one Love, if even one; the [...] "First Love which is infinite" [...] can be followed by no second like unto it.

60|$|Plate 11, Fig. 18 {{explains}} {{the nature of}} the apparent discrepancies better than a verbal description. In a a new ridge appears to be suddenly intruded between two <b>adjacent</b> <b>ones,</b> which have separated to make room for it; but a second print, taken from the same finger, may have the appearance of either b or c, showing that the new ridge is in reality a fork of one or other of them, the low connecting neck having failed to leave an impression. The second line of examples shows how an enclosure which is clearly defined in d may give rise to the appearance of broken continuity shown in e, and how a distinct island f in one of the prints may be the remnant of an enclosure which is shown in the other. These remarks are offered as a caution against attaching undue importance to disaccord in the details of the minutiæ that are found in the same place in different prints. Usually, however, the distinction between a fork and {{the beginning of a new}} ridge is clear enough; the islands and enclosures are also mostly well marked.|$|E
60|$|Some {{definite}} {{results may}} be gathered from this table notwithstanding the irregularity with which the figures run. Its upper and lower halves clearly belong to different statistical groups, the entries in the former being almost uniformly larger {{than those in the}} latter, in the proportion of 54° to 37°, say 3 to 2, which roughly represents in numerical terms the nearer relationship between digits of the same name, as compared to that between digits of different names. It seems also that of the 6 couplets of digits bearing different names, the relationship is closest between the middle finger and the two <b>adjacent</b> <b>ones</b> (60° and 52°, as against 24°, 27°, 39° and 23°). It is further seen in every pair of entries that whorls are related together more closely than loops. I note this, but cannot explain it. So far as my statistical inquiries into heredity have hitherto gone, all peculiarities were found to follow the same law of transmission, none being more surely inherited than others. If there were a tendency in any one out of many alternative characters to be more heritable than the rest, that character would become universally prevalent, in the absence of restraining influences. But it does not follow that there are no peculiar restraining influences here, nor that what is true for heredity, should be true, in all its details, as regards the relationships between the different digits.|$|E

30|$|Since each pixel {{has eight}} {{adjacent}} pixels, we search the <b>adjacent</b> pixels <b>one</b> by one {{to insure the}} searched pixels are on the contour of characters; the pixel then moves to the next <b>adjacent</b> <b>one</b> to search the next contour pixel. During the searching process, we record the coordinates of the contour pixels {{that are used to}} compute contour roughness. It should be noted that one character may have more than one connected region; we search the connected regions one by one and record the contour pixel coordinates until all the contour pixels of the character are recorded.|$|R

60|$|That by any {{series of}} changes a protozoon should ever become a mammal, seems {{to those who}} are not {{familiar}} with zoology, and who have not seen how clear becomes the relationship between the simplest and the most complex forms when intermediate forms are examined, a very grotesque notion. Habitually looking at things rather in their statical aspect than in their dynamical aspect, they never realize the fact that, by small increments of modification, any amount of modification may in time be generated. That surprise which they feel on finding one whom they last saw as a boy, grown into a man, becomes incredulity when the degree of change is greater. Nevertheless, abundant instances are at hand of the mode in which we may pass to the most diverse forms by insensible gradations. Arguing the matter some time since with a learned professor, I illustrated my position thus:--You admit that there is no apparent relationship between a circle and an hyperbola. The one is a finite curve; the other is an infinite one. All parts of the one are alike; of the other no parts are alike [save parts on its opposite sides]. The one incloses a space; the other will not inclose a space though produced for ever. Yet opposite as are these curves in all their properties, they may be connected together by a series of intermediate curves, no one of which differs from the <b>adjacent</b> <b>ones</b> in any appreciable degree. Thus, if a cone be cut by a plane at right angles to its axis we get a circle. If, instead of being perfectly at right angles, the plane subtends with the axis an angle of 89° 59´, we have an ellipse which no human eye, even when aided by an accurate pair of compasses, can distinguish from a circle. Decreasing the angle minute by minute, the ellipse becomes first perceptibly eccentric, then manifestly so, and by and by acquires so immensely elongated a form, as to bear no recognizable resemblance to a circle. By continuing this process, the ellipse passes insensibly into a parabola; and, ultimately, by still further diminishing the angle, into an hyperbola. Now here we have four different species of curve--circle, ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola--each having its peculiar properties and its separate equation, and the first and last of which are quite opposite in nature, connected together as members of one series, all producible by a single process of insensible modification.|$|E
