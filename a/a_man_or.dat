5|$|According to Dasgupta, {{the term}} yoga {{can be derived}} from either of two roots, yujir yoga (to yoke) or yuj samādhau (to concentrate). Someone who {{practices}} yoga or follows the yoga philosophy {{with a high level of}} commitment is called a yogi (may be applied to <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> a woman) or yogini (traditionally denoting a woman).|$|E

5|$|A reoccurring {{theme in}} legend and folktale {{consists}} of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>or,</b> more often, {{a woman who}} is challenged to gain as much land as can be traveled within a limited amount of time. This motif is attested by Livy around 1 CE, 5th century BCE Greek historian Herodotus, and in folktales from Northern Europe. In six tales from Jutland, Denmark and one from Germany a plough is used similarly as in Livy's account, though the conditions are often met by walking or riding.|$|E

5|$|In Jainism, Kubera is the {{attendant}} Yaksha of the 19th Tirthankar Mallinath. He is usually called Sarvanubhuti or Sarvahna, {{and may be}} depicted with four faces, rainbow colours and eight arms. The Digambara sect of Jainism gives him six weapons and three heads; while the Svetambaras portray him with four to six arms, numerous choices of weapons, though his attributes, the money bag and citron fruit are consistent. He may ride <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> an elephant. He {{is related to the}} Buddhist Jambhala rather than the Hindu Kubera.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 2010, {{tourists}} found a jawbone on an Aruban beach {{near the}} Phoenix Hotel and Bubali Swamp. Preliminary examination by a forensic {{expert on the}} island determined that the bone was from a young woman. A part of the bone was sent to The Hague for testing by the Netherlands Forensic Institute. On November 23, 2010, Aruba Solicitor-General Taco Stein announced that—based on dental records—the jawbone was not from Holloway, {{and it was not}} possible to determine whether it had come from <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> woman.|$|E
5|$|Both Buddhism and the Lingbao School {{share the}} idea of the Five Paths of Rebirth (Gati). People were reborn into earth prisons, as a hungry ghost, as an animal, as <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>or</b> as a {{celestial}} being. After death, the body would be alchemically refined in the Palace of Supreme Darkness located in the north, and the Southern Palace in the south. The transmutation of the body consisted of two steps; the yin components of the person were refined in the Palace of Supreme Darkness, followed by the yang components in the Southern Palace. The Lingbao concept of rebirth is a Chinese adaptation of Buddhism, mixing traditional Chinese concepts with newly arrived Buddhist ideas.|$|E

5|$|The 2012 French Open Men's singles final was the {{championship}} tennis match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 2012 French Open. It pitted the world's top two players, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, {{against each other}} in a Grand Slam tournament final for the fifth time overall and fourth consecutive time. This match had historical proportions as Djokovic would have become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win all four Majors simultaneously, whereas Nadal was looking to break Björn Borg's record of six French Open titles and equal Chris Evert's record of seven French Open titles held by <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> woman.|$|E
5|$|Captain Samuel Walker of the Texas Rangers had {{acquired}} {{some of the}} first Colt revolvers produced during the Seminole War and saw first-hand their effective use as his 15-man unit defeated a larger force of 70 Comanche in Texas. Walker wanted to order Colt revolvers for use by the Rangers in the Mexican-American War, and traveled to New York City in search of Colt. He met Colt in a gunsmith's shop on January 4, 1847, and placed an order for 1,000 revolvers. Walker asked for a few changes; the new revolvers would have to hold 6 shots instead of 5, have enough power to kill either <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> a horse with a single shot and be quicker to reload. The large order allowed Colt to establish a new firearm business. Colt hired Eli Whitney Blake, who was established in the arms business, to make his guns. Colt used his prototype and Walker's improvements as the basis for a new design. From this new design, Blake produced the first thousand-piece order known as the Colt Walker. The company then received an order for a thousand more; Colt took a share of the profits at $10 per pistol for both orders.|$|E
5|$|The name of Sejanus {{continued}} to be pressed into political service during the 18th century. Prime Minister Robert Walpole was attacked in 1735 {{in the course of}} a popular skit, C----- and country: A play of seven acts...the whole concluding with the grand masque, call'd, The downfall of Sejanus; its authorship is attributed to 'a masquerader' and in the printed version the masque precedes the play, although it is performed last. This gives the clue of how to take what is to follow and consists of a conversation between Punch and the Hangman, opening with the question 'Is this same Sejanus to go out of the World like <b>a</b> <b>Man,</b> <b>or</b> to die the Death of a mad Dog? For he has lived like a sad One, from the first Day that the Emperor Tiberius took him into Favour.' A subtler attack on a later prime minister occurred in 1769 when Jonson's Sejanus was reissued under the title of The Favourite. This was prefaced with a tongue-in-cheek dedication to Lord Bute, denying that there can be any comparison between the conduct of Sejanus and that of his lordship.|$|E

25|$|Giving head – A common slang {{term for}} giving oral sex to either <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> woman is giving head, from the term head job (in {{contrast}} to hand job, manual stimulation).

25|$|The Torah prescribes rituals {{addressing}} the skin condition known as tzaraath and unusual genital discharges in <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> women (Zav/Zavah), which required special sacrifices and rituals {{in the days}} of the Temple in Jerusalem including immersion in a mikveh. In addition, a period of ritual impurity follows a seminal discharge (keri) and a women's niddah period (menstruation), ending with ritual immersion.|$|E

25|$|Money {{made the}} concept of gender a broader, more {{inclusive}} concept than one of masculine/feminine. For him, gender included not only one's status as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> a woman, but was also {{a matter of personal}} recognition, social assignment, or legal determination; not only on the basis of one's genitalia but also on the basis of somatic and behavioral criteria that go beyond genital differences.|$|E

5000|$|Also in the Talmud, the {{interpretation}} is found of rabbi Hanina ben Pappa (3rd century AD), that Lailah is an angel {{in charge of}} conception who takes a drop of semen and places it before God, saying: [...] For R.

25|$|A polaznik, polažajnik, polaženik, or radovan, is {{the first}} person who visits the family on Christmas Day. This visit may be fortuitous or pre-arranged.

A family often picks in advance <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> boy, and arranges that he visit them on Christmas morning. If this proves to be lucky for the family, he is invited again next year to be the polaznik. If not, they send word to him not to come any more in that capacity.|$|E
25|$|The 16th century Swedish writer Olaus Magnus {{says that}} the Livonian werewolves were {{initiated}} by draining a cup of specially prepared beer and repeating a set formula.
