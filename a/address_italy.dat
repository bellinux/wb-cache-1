40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes {{works by}} two African Italian women writers of Somali descent, Ubax Cristina Ali Farah and Igiaba Scego, {{with a particular}} focus on representations of the voice and the body. Ali Farah and Scego, {{two of the most}} prominent authors of Italian postcolonial literature, <b>address</b> <b>Italy's</b> historical amnesia in their works through the personal stories/testimonies of their characters. The voices of Ali Farah's and Scego's protagonists narrate the intertwined histories between Italy and Somalia from Somalia's inception as an Italian colony in 1908 up to more recent events of civil war, piracy, and famine. The dissertation examines how multimodal storytelling in these authors' works helps capture the complexity of such histories, especially {{in the context of the}} Somali diaspora, which often requires a multitude of narrative modes in order to maintain personal bonds with a pre-civil war Somalia and with the people who have been killed or dispersed by war. The voice is also examined as a counterpoint to the voiceless representations of East Africans that span from Italy's beginnings as a nation to today in literature, visual media, and journalistic reports in Italian. Drawing from Adriana Cavarero's A più voci. Filosofia dell'espressone vocale [For More Than One Voice: Toward a Philosophy of Vocal Expression] (2003), the dissertation explores the interplay between orality and vocality, language and speech in two short stories and a novel by Ali Farah [...] "Rapdipunt" [Punt Rap] (2005), "Un sambuco attraversa il mare" [A Dhow Is Crossing the Sea] (2011) and Madre piccola [Little Mother] (2007) [...] and a short story and autobiographical novel by Scego [...] "Identità" [Identity] (2008) and La mia casa è dove sono [Home is Where I am] (2010).

Italy's crippled economy and the disastrous state of the roads did not assist in the redevelopment of the automobile markets. Enrico Piaggio {{decided to leave the}} aeronautical field in order to <b>address</b> <b>Italy's</b> urgent need for a modern and affordable mode of transportation. The idea was to design an inexpensive vehicle for the masses. Starting from Biella, based on a small motorcycle made for parachutists, the prototype, known as the MP5, was nicknamed [...] "Paperino" [...] (the Italian name for Donald Duck) because of its strange shape: but Enrico Piaggio did not like it, and he asked Corradino D’Ascanio to redesign it. Aeronautical engineer Corradino D'Ascanio - responsible for the design and construction of the first modern helicopter by Agusta - was asked therefore by Enrico Piaggio to create a simple, robust and affordable vehicle. The aeronautical designer didn't like motorcycles. He found them uncomfortable and bulky, with wheels that were difficult to change after a puncture. Corradino D'Ascanio's drawings {{had nothing to do with}} the Paperino: his design was absolutely original and revolutionary compared to all the other existing means of two-wheeled transport. With the help of Mario D'Este, his trusted designer, it would only take Corradino D'Ascanio a few days to fine tune his idea and prepare the first Vespa project, manufactured in Pontedera in April 1946. The vehicle had to be easy to drive for both men and women, be able to carry a passenger, and not get its driver's clothes dirty. Piaggio launched the Vespa scooter (Italian for [...] "wasp") and within ten years over a million units had been produced. The Italian language gained a new word, [...] "vespare", meaning to go somewhere on a Vespa.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the multiple relationships between food, space, and identity during Benito Mussolini's fascist regime (1922 - 43), and how foodways, politics, and policies shaped {{a new national}} consciousness in Italy. Beginning with a brief study on {{the formation of a}} national cuisine in the late nineteenth century, this examination focuses on food's central position within fascist Italian society and the diverse agents, ranging from the State to individuals, who built a new physical and mental space of the young nation through the manipulation of food and food habits. The regime's drive for alimentary sovereignty dictated many of its political goals concerning food, especially after the League of Nations imposed sanctions on Italy in 1935. By launching food propaganda campaigns and solidifying the concept of a national cuisine, the State constructed a unified Italian identity that aimed to be impervious to foreign influences. Its policies were resonated and aided by unlikely groups and individuals such as the avant-garde Futurists and the female domestic scientists. Written by the poet F. T. Marinetti and the artist Filla, The Futurist Cookbook championed a new and radical way of eating that favored the bodily experience of food and taste. Though irreverent and extreme in its tone, this manifesto-like cookbook simultaneously <b>addressed</b> <b>Italy's</b> national identity and the making of Italians, echoing in many respects the political ambitions of the fascist regime. Taking a different approach, the Italian female domestic scientists, in concert with governmental initiatives, advocated for household rationalization "especially that of the kitchen" as a modernizing catalyst in Italy. The transformation of the kitchen space into a command center for housewives explored the possibilities and limits of the quotidian and visceral acts of preparing and consuming food. The goal of liberating fascist women from drudgeries also revealed the strategic nature of fascist ideologies in ensuring that women would have time to perform their patriotic duties to the State. The reconception of the kitchen space and the introduction of a new consumer culture served to further reinstate the gender hierarchy within the fascist society. As such, this thesis focuses on the sensory perception of taste as a cultural and social construction, and its ability to delineate different types of spaces that together defined a national identity. A visually-oriented history, this case study demonstrates the power and potential of food in serving political, sensual, aesthetic, and everyday purposes. These explorations also serve to elucidate the central role of food in contemporary Italy and their seemingly inseparable identity. 2019 - 10 - 0...|$|R

40|$|WP 16 / 2000; n {{this paper}} {{we attempt to}} {{shed some light on}} the way the {{regulation}} of public transit systems has been approached in the past and is presently <b>addressed</b> in <b>Italy.</b> The reduction of x-inefficiency represents a great challenge for the local authorities, given the high operating costs faced by the transportation companies and the moderate tariffs level that do not allow the operators to balance costs and revenues. Throughout the 1980 's and {{the first half of the}} 1990 's, the problem was essentially met by means of stopgap measures taken mainly for emergency, to curb the deficit build-up. In the past five years it has been turning the efforts towards a radical reorganization of the whole local public transportation (LPT) industry, with the law 549 / 95, completed with the Decreti Legge 422 / 97 and 400 / 99. The reform process includes among its goals the attribution of financial responsibility to the sector operators and the start of privatization of the public transit systems. The introduction of more competitive environment, mainly by the resort to tendering for the allotment of concessions, represents the challenge for the future. A complete evaluation of the achieved results is probably still premature. Nevertheless, as the first goal is concerned, the reform appears suitable to yield some positive result. On the contrary, the liberalization and privatization of the LPT sector is progressing very slowly, due to the protection still given to the public-owned companies. It is then expected that in the future a decisive action with regard to such important aspects of the regulatory reform will be undertaken...|$|R

"At end, {{when you}} get your big, fat plum, just as you set your [...] teeth in it, oh! {{something}} blow {{it out of your}} mouth, I know not [...] what, the speerits will not say, perhaps because they do not know, [...] for they have not prescience of all things. But of this be sure, [...] my Godfrey, when that happen, that it is your own fault, for had [...] you trusted to your godmamma Riennes it never would have chanced, [...] since she would have shown you how to get your plum and eat it to [...] the stone and then throw away the stone and get other plums and be [...] happy--happy and full instead of empty. Well, so it is, and as I [...] must I tell you. There is but one hope for you, unless you would [...] go sorrowful. To come back to your godmamma, who will teach you [...] how to walk and be happy--happy and get all you want. Also, since [...] she is now poor, you would do well to send her a little money to [...] this <b>address</b> in <b>Italy,</b> since that old humbug of a Pasteur, whom [...] she cannot harm because of the influences round him, still [...] prevents her from returning to Switzerland, where she has friends. [...] Now that big plum, it is very nice and you desire it much. Come to [...] your godmamma and she will show you how to get it off the tree [...] quickly. Yes, within one year. Or do not come and it will hang [...] there for many winters and shrivel as plums do, and at last one [...] bite and it will be gone. And then, my godson, then, my dear [...] Godfrey--well, perhaps I will tell you the rest another time. You [...] poor silly boy, who will not understand that the more you get the [...] more you will always have.|$|R
