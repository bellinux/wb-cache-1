5|$|Lad: A Dog was {{published}} by Dutton in April 1919, {{a year after the}} real-life Lad's death. Terhune continued receiving royalties for the novel up through his own death. His wife, Anice Terhune, ceased receiving the royalties after she surrendered the rights to them, along with those of Bruce and His Dog in exchange for E.P. Dutton agreeing to publish and perpetually print her work Across the Line, a supposed set of conversations she had with her late husband. With this agreement, Dutton became sole owners of the copyright to Lad: A Dog. Macrae later decided that the agreement was not completely fair to Anice and modified it to provide her a payment of $100 <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of her life, likely exceeding the profits they earned on the novels as the years passed.|$|E

25|$|The strikers {{demanded that}} the ship be allowed to {{continue}} to serve, along with a 35% wage increase for themselves. Their mission failed, and the night of the takeover proved to be the ship's last day of service for the CGT.

The town of Dukla was seized on 21 September. The area of the former Czechoslovak state border—heavily fortified by the Germans—was captured on 6 October; it took almost <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Soviet forces to reach Slovakia.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Prescott {{gave up a}} {{grace and}} favour home that he had rented from the RMT Union in Clapham; {{he had left the}} union in June 2002. Prescott paid £220 <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{property}} – a fifth of its market value. Though he had not declared the flat in the register of members' interests, he was subsequently exonerated by MPs who overruled Elizabeth Filkin, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. On 12 January 2006, Prescott apologised after it was revealed that the council tax for the government flat he occupied at Admiralty House was paid for using public money, rather than his private income. He repaid the amount, which came to £3,830.52 over nearly nine years.|$|E

25|$|When the Second World War began, Whiteley {{was serving}} in the War Office as a General Staff Officer, Grade 1 (GSO1). In May 1940 he was posted to General Headquarters (GHQ) Middle East in Cairo as Brigadier, General Staff (Operations) under General Sir Archibald Wavell. In February 1941, Whiteley {{conducted}} a series of meetings with President Franklin D. Roosevelt's emissary to Britain, William J. Donovan, who had been sent to the Middle East on a fact-finding mission. Following the passage of the United States Lend-Lease Act on 11 March 1941, Whiteley was sent to Washington, D.C. in May 1941 to present the President with Wavell's requirements. Whiteley's mission was fairly successful, and resulted in sixteen ships <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the year delivering supplies to the Middle East. Although not all of the requested items could be supplied, by the end of July store and equipment including nearly 10,000 trucks, 84 M3 Stuart tanks and 174 combat aircraft had arrived.|$|E
25|$|On 2 September, three Lockheed C-130 Hercules {{aircraft}} set {{off from}} Jakarta for Peninsula Malaysia, flying low to avoid detection by radar. The following night, {{two of the}} C-130 managed to reach their objective with their onboard PGT paratroopers, who jumped off and landed around Labis in Johore (about 100 miles north of Singapore). The remaining C-130 crashed into the Malacca Straits while trying to evade interception by an RAF Javelin FAW 9 launched from RAF Tengah. Due to a lightning storm, the drop of 96 paratroopers was widely dispersed. This resulted in them landing close to 1/10 Gurkhas, who were joined by 1st Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment (1 RNZIR) stationed near Malacca with 28 (Commonwealth) Brigade. Operations were commanded by 4 Malaysian Brigade, but it took <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> security force to capture or kill 90 of the 96 parachutists, {{for the loss of}} two men killed during the action.|$|E
25|$|The Lorenz {{messages}} were codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park. They were only sent in quantity from mid-1942. The Tunny networks {{were used for}} high-level messages between German High Command and field commanders. With the help of German operator errors, the cryptanalysts in the Testery (named after Ralph Tester, its head) worked out the logical structure of the machine despite not knowing its physical form. They devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, which culminated in Colossus, the world's first programmable digital electronic computer. This was designed and built by Tommy Flowers and his team at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill. The prototype first worked in December 1943, was delivered to Bletchley Park in January and first worked operationally on 5 February 1944. Enhancements were developed for the Mark 2 Colossus, {{the first of which}} was working at Bletchley Park on the morning of 1 June in time for D-day. Flowers then produced one Colossus <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of the war, making a total of ten with an eleventh part-built. The machines were operated mainly by Wrens in a section named the Newmanry after its head Max Newman.|$|E

25|$|The Nationals {{headed out}} to Milwaukee {{for the start of}} a seven-game roadtrip {{beginning}} August 31 and stretching into September having posted their highest win total in <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> season, despite injuries to key players like Harper, Scherzer, and Madson during August. After losing the last two games in their three-game set in Miami to start the month, they proceeded to win two of three from the Cubs on the road, win three of four from the Marlins and then two of three from the Giants at home, split the two-game interleague series with the visiting Angels, win three of four from the Padres and then two of three from the Astros on the road, split the four-game series with the visiting Mets, and then sweep the Marlins in three games at home. The Milwaukee Brewers ended Washington's four-game winning streak, winning 6–3 in the August 31 series opener despite Turner falling a home run shy of hitting for the cycle. All in all, the Nationals went 18–11 over the month of August and finished the month with a 81–52 record, good for second overall in the National League behind the Los Angeles Dodgers and 15 games up over the second-place Marlins in the National League East.|$|E
