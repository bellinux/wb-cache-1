40|$|Agricultural {{development}} is complex, highly dynamic and differs among varying contexts. Decision-making for sustainable agricultural development cannot {{be based on}} generalized science-based knowledge, but should include context-specific knowledge and values of local stakeholders. Computer models seem a useful tool to integrate scientific knowledge include local-specific data, and explore local-specific solutions. In this paper we study whether and how a multiple goal linear program (MGLP) model could enhance learning for sustainable development. According to the learning theory, multi-actor learning is only productive when it consists of first-order (experiential) learning and second-order (social) learning. We applied an action-research approach and explored {{the value of an}} MGLP model SHARES (SHAred RESources) for learning by agricultural extension staff and farmers in an integrated rural development project in Burkina Faso. Fieldwork showed the main value of SHARES in the capacity to generate farm scenarios and trigger second-order learning about tacit frames-of-reference. People rarely engage in secondorder learning, but pursue different objectives and often remain trapped in confusing discussions and action. SHARES was a critical boundary-spanning object that facilitated communication between farmers and <b>agricultural</b> staff, enhanced <b>mutual</b> understanding, and the determination of area- and category-specific farm development goals...|$|R

40|$|Aims: To {{study the}} {{epidemiology}} {{of breast cancer}} and identify the social factors associated with detection at a locally advanced tumour stage. Method: We performed a transversal observational study concerning patients who received a waiver from co-payments due {{to one of the}} 30 long-term disorders during the first semester of 1999. Results: The annual raw regional incidence was estimated to be 126 per 100, 000 women. Average patient age was 61. 8 years although 19. 8 % of the patients were younger than 50 years old. 26. 4 % of the tumours were diagnosed by individual mammography screening. 72. 6 % of tumours in stages T 0 and T 1 were discovered by mammography whereas 32. 0 % where diagnosed clinically. Invasive tumours measuring 10 mm or less represented 9. 6 % of all tumours while invasive tumour without lymph node involvement represented 60. 1 % of the total. After adjusting for age and marital status, the sole social factor associated with breast cancer discovery at a locally advanced stage was health coverage by the <b>mutual</b> <b>agricultural</b> fund (MSA) or the fund for non-salaried workers (AMPI) (OR= 1. 8; IC : 1. 16 - 2. 79). Conclusion: In the absence of a cancer register, this study enabled us to estimate the regional incidence of breast cancer. By following two indicators (the rate of invasive tumours measuring 10 mm or less and those without lymph node involvement), {{we will be able to}} evaluate the efficacy of the cancer screening program in the Aquitaine region...|$|R
40|$|In Bosnia Herzegovina the {{development}} of clear policy objectives and endorsement of a long-term, coherent and <b>mutual</b> <b>agricultural</b> and rural development policy have also been affected by structural problems: a lack of reliable information on population and other relevant issues, {{the absence of an}} adequate land registry system and cadastre. Moreover in BiH the agricultural and rural sectors are characterized by many factors that have typically affected transition countries such as land fragmentation, lack of agricultural mechanization and outdated production technologies, and rural aging, high unemployment and out-migration. In such a framework the condition and role of women in rural areas suffered for the lack of gender disaggregated data and a consequent poor information that lead to the exclusion of gender related questions in the agenda of public institutions and to the absence of targeted policy interventions. The aim of the research is to investigate the role and condition of women in the rural development process of Republic of Srpska and to analyze the capacity of extension services to stimulate their empowerment. Specific research questions include the status of women in the rural areas of Republic of Srpska, the role of government in fostering the empowerment of rural women, {{and the role of the}} extension service in supporting rural women. The methodology - inspired by the case study method developed by R. Yin - is designed along the three specific research questions that are used as building blocks. Each of the three research questions is investigated with a combination of methodological tools - including surveys, experts interviews and focus groups - aimed to overcome the lack of data and knowledge that characterize the research objectives...|$|R
40|$|Foreword The {{context for}} {{irrigation}} development in Africa has been changing rapidly and drastically {{over the past}} decade. On the one hand, there is increasing scepticism about the returns to public investment in irrigation development, and a resulting decline in such investment. On the other hand, there are continued serious concerns about food insecurity and economic under-development in Africa. The Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA) adopted the ambitious goal of achieving and sustaining a 6 percent annual growth rate, a goal that has since been endorsed by Africa’s Heads of State under the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). How is Africa to achieve such a growth rate in agriculture and attain the World Food Summit goal of halving the number of undernourished people by 2015 without substantial irrigation investments? The {{good news is that}} while public investment has declined in the past, there is increasing evidence of positive experiences with small-scale private sector supported irrigation development. Some 70 million ha are currently under private irrigation in developing countries but are not well accounted for in official government statistics. It is estimated that nearly three-quarters of the future investment needed in the developing countries would consist of private commitments. We now realise that in the past the potential role of the private sector has been under-estimated. It is this realisation which gave impetus to this workshop. In 2000, the Africa Regional Office of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) approached the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and the ACP-EU Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA) and proposed to co-organise the workshop. IWMI and CTA accepted the idea {{at a time when the}} former was establishing a new Africa Regional Office in Pretoria, South Africa and because it was in line with the latter’s policy and programme. While FAO led the organisation of the workshop, IWMI prepared these Proceedings for copublication by the three co-sponsors. As evidenced in these Proceedings, we believe the expectations we had for the Workshop were more than fulfilled. There are a number of interesting and promising projects in Africa that demonstrate the potential of the private sector in promoting irrigation. These projects are promoted by NGOs, local private firms and individuals. They include interesting cases of the public sector encouraging and enabling private sector participation and development. Some of these cases are presented in this volume. FAO, IWMI and CTA continue to work together on a range of programmes globally and in Africa. We perceive that together we can accomplish a lot in terms of supporting an African <b>agricultural</b> renaissance by <b>mutual</b> co-operation and partnerships with a range of African institutions. We are confident that these Proceedings will be useful for many researchers, policy makers and practitioners in agricultural development in Africa. Douglas J. Merrey Director for Africa IWMI M. J.

40|$|In Madagascar and Mali, rice {{farmers have}} come up with two {{different}} strategies for making sure they get a fairer deal for their crops. The rise in world rice prices has helped Malagasy farmers realise the real value of their produce, and made them determined not to carry on selling it off cheaply to collectors as soon as it is harvested. To avoid being at the mercy of traders, more and more small-scale producers in isolated areas are banding together under the umbrella of mutual funds to store their rice in village community warehouses. In the region of Mahitsy, some 30 km from the capital, the number of such warehouses managed by the Savings Bank and the mutual agricultural credit fund CECAM more than doubled {{in the space of a}} year, rising from 86 in 2004 to 227 in 2005. It takes just three people to set up a warehouse, enabling them to wait for prices to rise and, above all to borrow money from a mutual fund. Stocks of rice stored here serve as guaranty to <b>agricultural</b> <b>mutual</b> funds, which lend the equivalent of 75 % of the crop s value. Thanks to this system, many rice farmers have been able to diversify their output, moving into poultry keeping or vegetable production. In Mali, producers working plots of land managed by the Office du Niger, an organisation which manages the country's largest irrigated area, have this year decided not to sell their rice for any less than 200 F CFA a kilo (0. 30). They calculate that if they receive anything less than this, they will not cover their production costs and will be unable to pay the water charges to the State-owned body, which may evict them as a result. The coordinator of the Observatoire du marché agricole (OMA), which monitors commodity prices at markets in Mali, disapproves of this single price system, and instead recommends setting up a system of credit which allows farmers to meet their most pressing needs without having to sell their crops straight after harvest. In Madagascar and Mali, rice farmers {{have come up}} with two different strategies for making sure they get a fairer deal for their crops [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary global {{agriculture}} {{has been}} undergoing transition towards different pathways. In developed countries, {{a shift from}} productivist agriculture to multifunctional agriculture has begun since the 1980 s (Wilson, 2007). In the developing world, agricultural modernisation is still the primary strategy for agricultural development, and driven by urbanisation and industrialisation, deagrarianisation of rural society has been widely identified (Bryceson, 1996; Rigg, 2006 a). As the largest developing country in the world, China embarked on market reform three decades ago and has ever since experienced dramatic socio-economic transition towards modernisation, industrialisation and urbanisation. Significant levels of academic attention have focused on empirically identifying economic and policy drivers of Chinese agricultural production from a structuralist standpoint, largely neglecting the agency of smallholders and sociocultural factors. To address the resulting literature gap, this thesis adopts an approach that combines political economy and cultural analysis through an in-depth case study of a rural community in southwest China. A multi-methods approach is used to collect data, including questionnaires, in-depth interviews, focus groups, participant observation and the analysis of secondary data. The results suggest that Chinese smallholder agriculture has been dramatically transformed by an array of socio-economic forces. The “intensive, sustainable, diverse” Chinese smallholder agriculture which Netting (1993) portrayed, has been progressively shifted towards extensive, unsustainable and less diverse pathways. It suggests that the “perfunctory agriculture” performed by Chinese smallholders is the outcome of interactions and negotiations between various political, socio-economic and institutional constraints and farmers’ agency. Another key finding is that moving out of agriculture is becoming the norm in Chinese rural society. Most smallholders show willingness to rent out agricultural land and {{to enter into a}} capitalist relationship with employees, rather than primarily being cultivators of their land. Land transfer markets have become increasingly buoyant at the local level, and large-scale capitalist agriculture seems to be the desired future of Chinese smallholder agriculture for both the Chinese government and smallholders. Besides, based on the case of Hu Village, this thesis discusses the convergences and divergences between the road of Chinese agricultural development and that of developed countries and other emerging BRIC economies. Lastly, based on the findings of this research, four policy implications are proposed including sponsoring <b>agricultural</b> <b>mutual</b> aid groups, strengthening agricultural extension services, enhancing farmers’ negotiation power through laws, and initiating comprehensive socio-economic reforms to facilitate farmers’ pursuit of non-farm employments...|$|E
40|$|In Japan, the Insurance Business Law {{has been}} in {{operation}} in order to regulate the insurance business. This law became effective in 1900 and since then it {{has been in}} force up to present partially ammended several times and throughly ammended in 1929. After the War, the revision of the law has became necessary to meet the new phases of situations, however because of the various reasons, it has not been realized. The Insurance Business Law admits the two forms of the company, namely, joint-stock company and mutual company, to run the insurance business and no other form of company nor an underwriter is allowed to operate the business. The Insurance Business Law controls only the life and casuality insurances, i. e. fire, marine, transportation, automobile and other miscellaneous insurances. Accordingly, the business which has no literary meaning of insurance but has the same purpose of insurance are not controlled by the Law as long as they don't use the name of insurance. Thus, in Japan, there are many forms of insurance business which are not controlled by the Insurance Business Law and frequently the cooperative associations conduct miscellaneous businesses for the industrial or economic purpose, in addition to the mutual aid business. The associations which operate insurance business are the Agricultural Cooperative Association, the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Mutual</b> Aid Association under the Agricultural Indemnity Law, Fishery Cooperative Association, the Small Industries Cooperative Association, the Fire Insurance Mutual Aid Association, the Consumers Cooperative Association and other optional associations. These organizations operate the same insurance business as listed in the Insurance Business Law. Beside the aforementioned associations, there are also several kinds of mutual aid associations in the area of social insurance, for example, the Government Employees Mutual Aid Association the Public Corporation Employees Mutual Aid Association, and the Private Schools Teachers Mutual Aid Association operate the Health Insurance and Employees Pension Insurance. In addition to the insurance business of the cooperative associations which, the author believes, should be classified as business insurance, industrial insurance and social insurance, according to the method commonly used, there is an insurance by the cooperative associations against-damage-of the public property, that is the building and car which is almost similar to the fire insurance under the Insurance Business Law. The associations which operate these kinds of cooperative insurance business for the public property damage are classified as the following three national organizations such as 1) Prefectural Associations, 2) City Associations and 3) Town and Village Associations. These associations were officially organized under the Local Autonomy Law which was. revised in 1948 and which admits the Cooperative Insurance Business. The rate of the premium of these cooperative insurances is about half of that of insurance company and are continuously lowered tby a sliding scale. Nevertheless, the operating cost of the insurance business,for the public property by local governments through their national associotion is low and each year made the considerable amount of surplus. With these surplus, the associations installed the fire service arrangements and fire prevention equipments for the area and built the large center in Tokyo. These insurance business made inroads into, the business of the fire insurance companies and become more powerful competitors year after year. This article has been prepared by the author to show the development of the special form of insurance business, the legal structure of the insurance business, analysis of the operation and future trends of the insurance business for the public, property by the cooperative associations...|$|E
