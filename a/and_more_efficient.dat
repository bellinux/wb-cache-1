Standard displacement increased from 1,365 tons to 1,500 tons. The class {{introduced a new}} steam propulsion system that combined increases in pressure and temperature with {{a new type of}} lightweight steam turbine, proving simpler <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> than the Mahans' predecessors—so much so that it was used on many subsequent wartime US destroyers.|$|E
5|$|Two related {{processes}} for the carbonylation of methanol: the rhodium-catalyzed Monsanto process, and the iridium-catalyzed Cativa process. The latter process is greener <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> and has largely supplanted the former process, {{often in the}} same production plants. Catalytic amounts of water are used in both processes, but the Cativa process requires less, so the water-gas shift reaction is suppressed, and fewer by-products are formed.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1970s, {{airlines}} {{were considering}} upgrading their aging Douglas DC-8 aircraft as an alternative to buying new quieter <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> aircraft. Following the French KC-135 order in 1978, the April 1979 decision by United Airlines to upgrade 30 of their DC-8-61 aircraft with the CFM56-2 was important for securing the development of the CFM56; GE and SNECMA were two weeks away from freezing development had that order not materialized. This decision marked the first commercial purchase (rather than government/military) of the engine, and Delta Air Lines and Flying Tiger Line soon followed suit, giving the CFM56 a firm footing in both the military and commercial realms.|$|E
5|$|In August the UN {{also began}} using Korean civilians with A-frames as cargo {{carriers}} to move supplies {{up through the}} mountains to the front lines.

5|$|The Maratha {{redeployment}} was swifter <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> than Wellesley {{had anticipated}} and he immediately reacted by extending his front to deny Pohlmann {{the opportunity to}} outflank him. A battalion of pickets and the 74th Highlanders, which formed {{the right of the}} first and second lines, were ordered to move obliquely to the right. This allowed the 78th to anchor the left flank and Madras infantry battalions (the 1/10th, 1/8th, 1/4th and 2/12th) to form the centre of the British line. Wellesley's intention was to force back the Marathas from their guns and then– operating by his left to avoid the heavily defended Assaye– throw them back on the Juah and complete their destruction with his cavalry.|$|E

Vacant space was let to businesses, but the enormous complex was only ever partially occupied after Bass left. Vulnerable to damage and poorly maintained, fires started in 1969 and 1976, the latter resulting major damage to three of the malthouses. Some of the space was used for chicken-rearing by G. W. Padley (Property) Ltd. from 1973 into the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|As selected, the Nimrod MRA4 {{was to be}} {{produced}} as essentially a new aircraft. Significant changes {{were involved in the}} remanufacturing process, including the installation of current-generation BR710 turbofan engines, the adoption of a larger <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> wing, various new missions systems and avionics, and an extensively refurbished fuselage. Much larger air intakes were required on the MRA4 in order to provide the necessary airflow requirements imposed by the BR710 engine, which is significantly greater than that of the original Spey 250 that had powered the original Nimrod variants. The MRA4 had also borrowed heavily from Airbus technology; the glass cockpit used was derived from the Airbus A340 airliner. British Aerospace also teamed up with Boeing to provide the Nimrod MRA4's mission systems, making use of the later's work on mooted patrol aircraft systems for the P-3 and Boeing 737.|$|E

5|$|Because both {{methanol}} {{and carbon}} monoxide are commodity raw materials, methanol carbonylation long {{appeared to be}} attractive precursors to acetic acid. Henri Dreyfus at British Celanese developed a methanol carbonylation pilot plant as early as 1925. However, a lack of practical materials that could contain the corrosive reaction mixture at the high pressures needed (200 atm or more) discouraged commercialization of these routes. The first commercial methanol carbonylation process, which used a cobalt catalyst, was developed by German chemical company BASF in 1963. In 1968, a rhodium-based catalyst (cis−−) was discovered that could operate efficiently at lower pressure with almost no by-products. US chemical company Monsanto Company built the first plant using this catalyst in 1970, and rhodium-catalyzed methanol carbonylation became the dominant method of acetic acid production (see Monsanto process). In the late 1990s, the chemicals company BP Chemicals commercialised the Cativa catalyst (−), which is promoted by iridium for greater efficiency. This iridium-catalyzed Cativa process is greener <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> and has largely supplanted the Monsanto process, often in the same production plants.|$|E
5|$|Cromwell {{did much}} work through his many offices {{to remove the}} tasks of {{government}} from the Royal Household (and ideologically from the personal body of the King) and into a public state. He did so, however, in a haphazard fashion that left several remnants, not least because he needed to retain Henry's support, his own power, {{and the possibility of}} actually achieving the plan he set out. Cromwell made the various income streams put in place by Henry VII more formal and assigned largely autonomous bodies for their administration. The role of the King's Council was transferred to a reformed Privy Council, much smaller <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> than its predecessor. A difference emerged between the financial health of the king, and that of the country, although Cromwell's fall undermined much of his bureaucracy, which required his hand to keep order among the many new bodies and prevent profligate spending that strained relations as well as finances. Cromwell's reforms ground to a halt in 1539, the initiative lost, and he failed to secure the passage of an enabling act, the Proclamation by the Crown Act 1539. He too was executed, on 28 July 1540.|$|E
5|$|Following the Second World War {{the demand}} for {{electricity}} increased in the United Kingdom. In North East England, {{this led to the}} construction of two new power stations at Stella, along with the expansion of stations at Dunston and Billingham, to meet {{the demand for}} power quickly. At Blyth, a larger <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> plant was planned, consisting of six 100megawatts (MW) generating units. This increased to six 120MW units, before increasing again in the final proposal for an A station consisting of four 120MW units and a B station consisting of two 275MW units and two 350MW units. This gave the A and B stations generating capacities of 480MW and 1,250MW respectively. The Blyth Power Stations were to be an experiment, using a variety of generating set sizes at a time when engineers were trying to standardise power station plant and layout. Blyth was the first in the UK to use generating sets larger than the then standard 30MW and 60MW. The station's location was chosen because of its position within the super grid, rather than to be near a load centre.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} avoid its {{dependence}} on rare-earth minerals, Toyota Motor Corporation announced in January 2011 that it is developing an alternative motor for future hybrid and electric cars that does not need rare-earth materials. Toyota engineers in Japan and the U.S. are developing an induction motor that is lighter <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> than the magnet-type motor used in the Prius, which uses two rare earths in its motor magnets. Other popular hybrids and plug-in electric cars in the market that use these rare-earth elements are the Nissan Leaf, the Chevrolet Volt and Honda Insight. For its second generation RAV4 EV due in 2012, Toyota is using an induction motor supplied by Tesla Motors that does not require rare-earth materials. The Tesla Roadster and the Tesla Model S use a similar motor.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 18th century, the {{technology}} of cotton-spinning machinery improved, and the need for larger buildings to house bigger, better <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> equipment became apparent. The profitability of cotton spinning meant that open land that had been used for farming since antiquity, was utilised for purpose-built weavers' cottages. Larger buildings were still desired, and construction of two water powered cotton factories (two or three times the size of a cottage) can be traced to 1782. The construction of more mills followed—ten by 1789—facilitating a process of urbanisation and socioeconomic transformation in the region; the population moved away from farming, adopting employment in the factory system. The introduction of the factory system led to an increase of the township's population; from 872 in 1714 to 3,500 in 1801, mostly as a result of an influx of people from Yorkshire and Lancashire looking for employment in the cotton mills.|$|E
5|$|On November21, {{insurance}} {{payments for}} losses {{were expected to}} exceed $12million. On January1, 1963, a $2million relief fund was authorized by President Kennedy. Another $5.4million in relief funds were provided by President Lyndon B. Johnson on February15, 1964. The United States Congress provided Guam with $60million, including $45million through federal loans, mainly to help rebuild the territory and promote expansion of the economy. Additionally, the storm brought {{about the end of}} military security on the island, which in turn aided economic growth. Within five years of this decision, Japanese tourism to the island dramatically increased, prompting a major {{increase in the number of}} hotels. In the long term, Typhoon Karen, along with other destructive storms, shaped the development of the island's infrastructure. It led to higher quality buildings <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> utilities that could withstand powerful typhoons.

5|$|The normal peacetime British Army cavalry {{formation}} was the brigade, {{but twice}} a cavalry division had been formed. The {{first time was}} during the Anglo-Egyptian War in 1882. The second was during the Second Boer War (1899–1901) in South Africa, the last major conflict fought by the British Army before the First World War. During the fighting in South Africa, it was the 7,000-strong colonial mounted contingent, not the 5,000-strong regular cavalry, that {{led the way in}} tactical development. They were better trained, better armed, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient,</b> if only because they had been correctly trained to use the right weapons and tactics for the conflict. Since 1880 British cavalrymen had been armed with only carbines and swords, although some carried a lance; it was not until 1903 that the cavalry were issued rifles, the same ones used {{by the rest of the}} army. The regular cavalry regiments were considered so poor in quality that General Sir Redvers Henry Buller, commanding the advance into Northern Natal, left his six cavalry regiments behind at Ladysmith, trusting in the irregular mounted forces to carry out patrols in their stead.|$|E
5|$|With the popularisation of {{the motor}} car, {{it was found that}} plowing alone was {{insufficient}} for removing all snow and ice from the roadway, leading to the development of gritting vehicles, which used sodium chloride to accelerate the melting of the snow. Early attempts at gritting were resisted, as the salt used encouraged rusting, causing damage to the metal structures of bridges and the shoes of pedestrians. However, as the number of motoring accidents increased, the protests subsided {{and by the end of}} the 1920s, many cities in the United States used salt and sand to clear the roads and increase road safety. As environmental awareness increased through the 1960s and 1970s, gritting once again came under criticism due to its environmental impact, leading to the development of alternative de-icing chemicals <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> spreading systems.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, {{the lineage}} and honors were {{designated}} {{to be transferred}} to the 16th Sustainment Brigade. On 16 July 2007 the group was reorganized {{as part of an effort}} to reform support groups into larger, more versatile sustainment brigades. It became the 16th Sustainment Brigade and was subsequently activated at Warner Barracks in Bamberg, Germany. The 16th Corps Support Group and the 7th Corps Support Group had been deactivated and combined to form the new formation. Their subordinate units had been moved and redesignated as well. This move made the 16th Sustainment Brigade the only brigade-sized logistics unit supporting United States Army Europe. It was put under the command of the 21st Theater Sustainment Command. The move was part of an overall streamlining of the Command's logistics element, as all major logistics formations were redesigned to be modular <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient.</b> The sustainment brigade not only retained all previous logistics functions and responsibilities, but also assumed additional services, like finance, medical and signal capabilities. The brigade was composed of the 16th Special Troops Battalion headquartered at Bamberg, the 391st Combat Sustainment Support Battalion at Bamberg, and the 18th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion in Grafenwoehr. It also received its shoulder sleeve insignia.|$|E
