This effect was apparent over a range of antigen doses. ALG also reduced the antibody responses of congenitally athymic mice to SRBC and SIII. The possible mode of action of ALG is discussed in the light of these, and other, observations...|$|E
40|$|A 22 year-old {{patient with}} severe aplastic anaemia responded to <b>antilymphocytic</b> <b>globulin</b> but {{developed}} recurrent fever despite treatment with steroids and then antibacterial, antifungal, and antituberculous drugs. There was progression, with severe joint pains and immobility associated with radiological {{evidence of a}} symmetrical destructive process. A bone marrow specimen showed no evidence of malignancy, and cultures of blood, urine, and stool were negative but enriched broth cultures of an open biopsy specimen of the humeral head grew Salmonella enteritidis phage type 4. Treatment with ciprofloxacin resulted in considerable symptomatic improvement: a total of 12 months of treatment is planned. Salmonella osteomyelitis, particularly with this unusual pattern of disease, has not previously been described in aplastic anaemia...|$|E

40|$|Summary. -Adult CBA mice thymectomized, {{treated with}} <b>antilymphocytic</b> <b>globulin</b> (ALG) and inoculated with human leprosy organisms were accidentally {{infected}} with polyoma virus and all developed tumours. After cessation of ALG administration, some animals were given spleen cells from syngeneic donors immunized with polyoma virus; none developed tumours. Similar results were obtained in mice deliberately infected with polyoma virus {{but not with}} leprosy organisms. Passive transfer of antibody before but not after virus inoculation prevented tumour formation in immunosuppressed recipients. Virus infection in thymectomized, lethally irradiated and bone marrow reconstituted mice resulted in only a very low incidence of tumours. These results emphasize the role of immunological surveillance in preventing polyoma tumour formation under natural conditions. LONG-TERM immunosuppression increases the frequency of neoplasia and reduces induction time after laboratory infection or inoculation of polyoma or leukaemogenic viruses into adult mic...|$|E
40|$|<b>Antilymphocytic</b> <b>globulin</b> (ALG) {{suppressed}} {{the development of}} haemolytic anaemia with positive antiglobulin (Coombs) reactions in intact and adult thymectomized New Zealand Black (NZB) mice, although some recipients eventually became positive after treatment was stopped. Macroglobulinaemia and lymphoid cell infiltrates were resistant and complex nephritis was unaffected by, and in thymectomized recipients accelerated by, ALG, whilst many such recipients developed severe Coombs negative haemolytic anaemia. Splenomegaly was less pronounced in ALG treated than in control NZB mice. However, lymphoproliferative changes in general, and reticulum cell hyperplasia in particular, progressed despite ALG treatment in early life. On the other hand, this agent did not provoke overt neoplasia in the lymphatic or other tissues. Syngeneic lymphoid cells from young donors did not influence the disease of ALG treated mice but rat lymphoid cells in thymectomized recipients induced a temporary suppression of macroglobulinaemia and reticulum cell proliferation was reduced...|$|E
