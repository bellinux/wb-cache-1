5|$|Although Australia is {{generally}} considered to be more suited to summer sport, several ice-based sports take place as well. Snow falls on the Australian Alps and parts of Tasmania. The Australian Alps are within six hours' drive for residents of Sydney, but within two hours' drive for residents of Melbourne and Canberra, Tasmanian ski slopes are within a day's drive for residents of the major cities of Hobart and Launceston. However, the season is quite short, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> is skiable for only about four months per year. Skiing in Australia was first introduced by Norwegian miners in the goldrush town of Kiandra, New South Wales, around 1859, near today's Selwyn Snowfields ski resort. The sport remains a popular winter activity in the south-eastern states and territories. Major alpine skiing resorts include Thredbo, Perisher and Charlotte Pass in New South Wales; Mount Hotham, Falls Creek and Mount Buller in Victoria and Mount Ben Lomond in Tasmania. Victoria has three dedicated cross-country ski resorts and extensive areas are available for cross-country skiing within national parks including Kosciuszko National Park (NSW), Alpine National Park (VIC); Namadgi National Park (ACT) and in the Tasmanian Wilderness.|$|E
5|$|In the Poconos, in Carbon County, The Mansion Hill (SR 209) exiting Jim Thorpe towards Lehighton {{was closed}} {{for most of the}} 14th due to snow slides {{blocking}} the major artery or tractor-trailer trucks becoming stuck and blocking the travel lanes. The road reopened about 2:30 PM on the 14th, however it was shut down again at 3:06 PM due to an accident. This was a main trouble spot <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> and sleet reportedly drifted on the hill across part of the highway. Drifts were reported to be higher than some vehicles. At 8:20 AM on the 14th, it was decided that drifting was occurring more frequently than road crews could clear, resulting in the heavily traveled road being closed. All schools in the county canceled classes as early as the evening of the 13th. Lansford continued their state of emergency on the 15th, which was issued on the 14th. This means that all non-essential travel should be avoided. One accident occurred when a tractor-trailer jack-knifed on the Mansion House Hill, Route 209, in Jim Thorpe at about 4 AM on the 14th. The Pennsylvania Turnpikes Lehighton interchange was closed because of a tractor-trailer crash on the 14th, and state police closed Interstate 81 late in the afternoon of the 14th, deeming it impassable. Interstate 380 also was closed because of bad road conditions.|$|E

25|$|The Aletsch Glacier {{resulted}} from the accumulation and compaction of snow. Glaciers generally form where snow and ice accumulation exceeds snow and ice melt. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> and ice thicken it reaches {{a point where it}} begins to move due to a combination of gravity and pressure of the overlying snow and ice.|$|E
25|$|The {{mouldboard}} plough greatly reduced {{the amount of}} time needed to prepare a field, and as a consequence, allowed a farmer to work a larger area of land. In addition, the resulting pattern of low (under the mouldboard) and high (beside it) ridges in the soil forms water channels, allowing the soil to drain. In areas where snow buildup causes difficulties, this lets farmers plant the soil earlier, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> runoff drains away more quickly.|$|E
25|$|The 2011–13 Russian protests (which some English {{language}} media {{referred to}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Snow</b> Revolution) began in 2011 (as {{protests against the}} 2011 Russian legislative election results) and continued into 2012 and 2013. The protests were motivated by claims by Russian and foreign journalists, political activists {{and members of the}} public that the election process was flawed. The Central Election Commission of Russia stated that only 11.5% of official reports of fraud could be confirmed as true.|$|E

25|$|Passenger {{services}} operated across London {{through the}} Snow Hill Tunnel from mid-Victorian times until World War I, when services terminated at Moorgate from the Midland {{line to the}} north, and at Holborn Viaduct from the south, {{at a time when}} most inner cross-London traffic had been lost to buses and trams. There were low-level platforms under the main part of Holborn Viaduct station known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Snow</b> Hill platforms: these can still be seen when leaving City Thameslink station travelling northwards.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> became deeper {{through the}} night there was panic because {{of the fear of}} being buried or suffocated. With {{daylight}} on Sunday, a boy could be heard shouting under the surface and Sunderland was barely conscious. Davidson and the other boy set off to get help but only got a few yards before they were forced back. Throughout the day the blizzard raged and after dark they could see the flares of a search party but their shouts were not heard and they had lost their own flares in the snow. During this night the children were becoming delirious and were dying. On Monday morning Davidson set off by herself to try to get rescue.|$|E
25|$|When a slab {{avalanche}} forms, {{the slab}} disintegrates into increasingly smaller fragments <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> travels downhill. If the fragments become small enough the outer {{layer of the}} avalanche, called a saltation layer, takes {{on the characteristics of}} a fluid. When sufficiently fine particles are present they can become airborne and, given a sufficient quantity of airborne snow, this portion of the avalanche can become separated from the bulk of the avalanche and travel a greater distance as a powder snow avalanche. Scientific studies using radar, following the 1999 Galtür avalanche disaster, confirmed the hypothesis that a saltation layer forms between the surface and the airborne components of an avalanche, which can also separate from the bulk of the avalanche.|$|E

50|$|By the mid-18th century, upland {{farming in}} the Patuxent basin without erosion control led to massive silting of the river. The ports along the Patuxent quickly filled with silt and {{could no longer}} take in ocean-going vessels such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>snows</b> that frequented <b>the</b> town. The last cargo ship left for England about 1790, and the town began to decline.|$|R
25|$|The Southern Schneeferner is {{surrounded}} by the peaks of the Wetterspitzen and the Wetterwandeck. It is also a remnant of the once great Platt Glacier. Today, the Southern Schneeferner extends up {{as far as the}} arête and therefore has no protection from direct sunshine. It has also been divided into two basins by a ridge of rock that has appeared <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> has receded. It is a matter of debate whether the Southern Schneeferner should still be classified as a glacier. The Southern Schneeferner also reached its last high point in 1979, when it covered an area of 31.7 hectares. This had shrunk by 2006 to just 8.4 hectares however. The highest point of the glacier lies at an elevation of 2,665 metres and the lowest at 2,520metres.|$|E
25|$|The diet of {{the snow}} leopard varies across its range and with the time of year, and depends on prey availability. In the Himalayas, it preys mostly on bharals (Himalayan blue sheep), but in other {{mountain}} ranges, such as the Karakoram, Tian Shan, Altai and Tost Mountains of Mongolia, its main prey consists of Siberian ibex and argali, a type of wild sheep, although the latter has become rarer in some parts {{of the snow}} leopard's range. Other large animals eaten when available can include various types of wild goats and sheep (such as markhors and urials), other goat-like ruminants such as Himalayan tahr and gorals, plus deer, red panda, wild boars, and langur monkeys. Smaller prey consists of marmots, woolly hares, pikas, various rodents, and birds such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> cock and chukar.|$|E
500|$|All {{watercourses}} in {{the park}} {{are part of the}} Columbia River drainage basin.

2500|$|In {{most of the}} Arctic the {{significant}} snow melt begins in late May or sometime in June.
