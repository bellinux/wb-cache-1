40|$|Abstract Background Cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) {{expression}} {{has previously}} been identified in uveal melanoma although the biological role of COX- 2 in this intraocular malignancy has not been elucidated. This study aimed to investigate {{the effect of a}} COX- 2 inhibitor on the proliferation rate of human uveal melanoma cells, as well as its effect on the cytotoxic response of macrophages. Methods Human uveal melanoma cell lines were transfected to constitutively express COX- 2 and the proliferative rate of these cells using two different methods, with and without the addition of <b>Amfenac,</b> was measured. Nitric oxide production by macrophages was measured after exposure to melanoma-conditioned medium from both groups of cells as well as with and without <b>Amfenac,</b> the active metabolite of Nepafenac. Results Cells transfected to express COX- 2 had a higher proliferation rate than those that did not. The addition of <b>Amfenac</b> significantly decreased the proliferation rate of all cell lines. Nitric oxide production by macrophages was inhibited by the addition of melanoma conditioned medium, the addition of <b>Amfenac</b> partially overcame this inhibition. Conclusion <b>Amfenac</b> affected both COX- 2 transfected and non-transfected uveal melanoma cells in terms of their proliferation rates as well as their suppressive effects on macrophage cytotoxic activity. </p...|$|E
40|$|Purpose To {{evaluate}} the proliferation rates of five human uveal melanoma (UM) cell lines after treatment with <b>amfenac,</b> a cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2 inhibitor, and subsequent radiation exposure. Methods Five human UM cell lines (92. 1, SP 6. 5, MKT-BR, OCM- 1, and UW- 1) and one human fibroblast cell line (BJ) were incubated with <b>amfenac.</b> Treated and non-treated cell lines were then exposed to various doses of gamma radiation: 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 Gy. Sulphorhodamine-B assay {{was used to}} assess proliferation rates 48 h post-radiation. Results Treatment of UM cell lines with <b>amfenac</b> prior to radiation led to a marked reduction in proliferation rates. This difference was statistically significant in all cell lines at every radiation dose (P < 0. 005), with the exception of 92. 1 at 2 Gy (P= 0. 157). Fibroblasts treated with <b>amfenac</b> showed significantly higher proliferation rates after 2 and 8 Gy, with no significant differences at 0, 4, and 6 Gy. Conclusions the radiosensitivity of UM cell lines was increased by the administration of <b>amfenac,</b> the active metabolite of nepafenac. There appears to be a radioprotective effect of <b>amfenac</b> on human fibroblasts. the topical administration of nepafenac may decrease tumour recurrence and radiation-induced complications while broadening the indications for radiotherapy by treating larger tumours.

40|$|AbstractNepafenac {{ophthalmic}} suspensions, 0. 1 % (NEVANAC®) and 0. 3 % (ILEVRO™), are topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) products {{approved in}} the United States, Europe {{and various other}} countries to treat pain and inflammation associated with cataract surgery. NEVANAC is also approved in Europe for {{the reduction in the}} risk of postoperative macular edema (ME) associated with cataract surgery in diabetic patients. The efficacy against ME suggests that topical administration leads to distribution of nepafenac or its active metabolite <b>amfenac</b> to the posterior segment of the eye. This article evaluates the ocular distribution of nepafenac and <b>amfenac</b> and the extent of local delivery to the posterior segment of the eye, following topical ocular instillation in animal models. Nepafenac ophthalmic suspension was instilled unilaterally in New Zealand White rabbits as either a single dose (0. 1 %; one drop) or as multiple doses (0. 3 %, one drop, once-daily for 4 days, or 0. 1 % one drop, three-times daily for 3 days and one morning dose on day 4). Nepafenac (0. 3 %) was also instilled unilaterally in cynomolgus monkeys as multiple doses (one drop, three-times daily for 7 days). Nepafenac and <b>amfenac</b> concentrations in harvested ocular tissues were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Locally-distributed compound concentrations were determined as the difference in levels between dosed and undosed eyes. In single-dosed rabbit eyes, peak concentrations of locally-distributed nepafenac and <b>amfenac</b> showed a trend of sclera > choroid > retina. Nepafenac peak levels in sub-samples posterior to the eye equator and inclusive of the posterior pole (E-PP) were 55. 1, 4. 03 and 2. 72  nM, respectively, at 0. 25 or 0. 50  h, with corresponding <b>amfenac</b> peak levels of 41. 9, 3. 10 and 0. 705  nM at 1 or 4  h. By comparison, peak levels in sclera, choroid and retina sub-samples in a band between the ora serrata and the equator (OS-E) were 13 - to 40 -fold (nepafenac) or 11 - to 23 -fold (<b>amfenac)</b> higher, indicating an anterior-to-posterior directional concentration gradient. In multiple-dosed rabbit eyes, with 0. 3 % nepafenac instilled once-daily or 0. 1 % nepafenac instilled three-times daily, cumulative 24 -h locally-distributed levels of nepafenac in E-PP retina were similar between these groups, whereas exposure to <b>amfenac</b> once-daily dosing nepafenac 0. 3 % was 51 % of that achieved with three-times daily dosing of 0. 1 %. In single-dosed monkey eyes, concentration gradients showed similar directionality as observed in rabbit eyes. Peak concentrations of locally-distributed nepafenac were 1580, 386, 292 and 13. 8  nM in E-PP sclera, choroid and retina, vitreous humor, respectively, at 1 or 2  h after drug instillation. Corresponding <b>amfenac</b> concentrations were 21. 3, 11. 8, 2. 58 and 2. 82  nM, observed 1 or 2  h post-instillation. The data indicate that topically administered nepafenac and its metabolite <b>amfenac</b> reach pharmacologically relevant concentrations in the posterior eye segment (choroid and retina) via local distribution, following an anterior-to-posterior concentration gradient. The proposed pathway involves a choroidal/suprachoroidal or periocular route, along with an inward movement of drug through the sclera, choroid and retina, with negligible vitreal compartment involvement. Sustained high nepafenac concentrations in posterior segment tissues may be a reservoir for hydrolysis to <b>amfenac...</b>|$|E
30|$|In Japan, the {{ophthalmic}} preparations {{of steroids}} or NSAIDs {{are used for}} the treatment of postoperative inflammation following cataract surgery. NSAIDs are also used for the prevention of postoperative cystoid macular edema (CME). Diclofenac sodium and bromfenac have been shown to reduce postoperative inflammation [7 – 10]. Some studies have shown that aqueous flare values in the early postoperative period are even lower in those treated with diclofenac sodium than in those treated with steroids [11, 12]. Other studies have demonstrated that NSAIDs are effective in preventing postoperative CME [13 – 16], in which an ophthalmic NSAID was administered for several months after cataract surgery. Nepafenac is a prodrug metabolized into its active form, <b>amfenac.</b> Ex vivo inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by nepafenac/amfenac was significantly greater and of longer duration than diclofenac [2]. And nepafenac had sixfold greater corneal penetration than diclofenac [17]. <b>Amfenac</b> was the more potent COX- 2 inhibitor than bromfenac and ketorolac. And the combined area under the curve of nepafenac and <b>amfenac</b> was higher than the bromfenac and ketorolac [1].|$|E
30|$|Nepafenac is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) and a prodrug that is metabolized {{into its}} active form, <b>amfenac,</b> following ocular administration. Delivering <b>amfenac</b> as a prodrug permits increased corneal penetration and high aqueous {{concentration of the}} compound [1]. <b>Amfenac</b> suppresses prostaglandin production by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX), as do other NSAIDs [1]. Following the administration of diclofenac, total prostaglandin production by the rabbit iris–ciliary body was inhibited by approximately 40 % within 5  min and remained unchanged thereafter, while nepafenac exhibited an inhibitory effect on prostaglandin production between 5 and 10  min after administration, with the inhibitory rate exceeding 90 % between 40 and 80  min after administration [2]. The inhibitory effect of nepafenac on extravascular protein exudation into the aqueous humor of the rabbit continued for 8  h after administration while diclofenac inhibited vascular permeation up to 4  h after administration but exhibited no significant inhibitory effect 8  h after administration [2]. Since its launch in the USA in 2005, nepafenac 0.1 % has been widely used in clinical practice in more than 70 countries worldwide.|$|E
40|$|The {{practical}} {{utility of}} chemically incorporating drugs into polymers for the localized and sustained delivery of such drugs {{has been well}} established. Sustained release provides therapeutic concentrations of drug over a long time period, obviating the need for frequent dosing, leading to better patient compliance and mitigating the likelihood of overdosing. Localized delivery mitigates the severity of side effects associated with systemic administration and increases efficacy by increasing the effective dosage {{at the site of}} the pathology. In this thesis, these principles have been investigated for the delivery of anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer drugs. <b>Amfenac,</b> a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), in the form of its prodrug nepafenac, has been proven to be effective for the treatment of anterior uveitis (i. e. ocular inflammation) via topical administration of an aqueous suspension, but posterior uveitis is difficult to treat in this manner as drug penetration to the rear of the eye is inefficient and iii clearance is very rapid, limiting the practicality of administration by injection. The objective was to chemically incorporate <b>amfenac</b> into a biodegradable polymer that can be fabricated into microspheres suitable for injection into the rear of the eye for the sustained release of <b>amfenac</b> t...|$|E
40|$|Purpose To {{examine the}} effect of nepafenac, a {{selective}} cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) inhibitor, on the proliferation rate of two human retinoblastoma (Rb) cell lines. Methods Two human Rb cell lines (WERI-RB and Y 79) were cultured. COX- 2 expression in these cell lines was verified by imunocytochemical analysis of cytospin sections and Western blotting. An MTT-based proliferation assay was used to compare Rb cell growth with and without <b>amfenac,</b> the active metabolite of nepafenac. the averaged results per condition were recorded. the Student's t-test was used to compare results from the cells cultured with and without <b>amfenac.</b> Result the Y 79 cell line showed a higher proliferative rate than the WERI-RB cell line. Both cell lines were negative for COX- 2 expression by immunocytochemical analysis; however, both cell lines were positive for COX- 2 expression by Western blot. When <b>amfenac</b> was added to both of the cell lines, a statistically significant reduction in proliferation was observed in both cell lines. the two Rb cell lines were positive for COX- 2 only in the Western blot, indicating that they probably express low levels of COX- 2, which was undetectable by immucytochemical analysis. Conclusion the selective, anti-COX- 2 molecule <b>amfenac</b> inhibited proliferation of both tested Rb cell lines. Further trials should be undertaken to study {{the effect of}} selective COX- 2 inhibitors on Rb.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the pharmacokinetics {{and efficacy of}} topically applied nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the retinochoroidal tissues of rabbits. Methods: The cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitory activity of diclofenac, bromfenac, and <b>amfenac,</b> an active metabolite of nepafenac, were determined using human-derived COX- 1 and COX- 2. Each of the three NSAIDs was applied topically to rabbits, and after 0. 5 to 8 hrs, the concentration of each drug in the aqueous humor and the retinochoroidal tissues was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The pharmacokinetics of the drugs in the tissues after repeated doses as is done on patients was calculated by a simulation software. The inhibitory effect of each NSAID on {{the breakdown of the}} blood-retinal barrier was assessed by the vitreous protein concentration on concanavalin A-induced retinochoroidal inflammation in rabbits. Results: The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of diclofenac, bromfenac, and <b>amfenac</b> was 55. 5, 5. 56, and 15. 3 nM for human COX- 1, and 30. 7, 7. 45, and 20. 4 nM for human COX- 2, respectively. The three NSAIDs were detected in the aqueous humor and the retinochoroidal tissue at all-time points. Simulated pharmacokinetics showed that the levels of the three NSAIDs were continuously higher than the IC 50 of COX- 2, as an index of efficacy, in the aqueous humor, whereas only the bromfenac concentration was continuously higher than the IC 50 at its trough level in the retinochoroidal tissues.

40|$|Eye {{inflammation}} can {{be caused}} by different factors — allergies, infection, trauma (including surgery). It can have severe complications, last even after elimination the reason and cause the visual impairment as an outcome. Two main classes of anti-inflammatory agents (corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) are used for the prevention and relief of the inflammatory process. Along with the fact that corticosteroids are the «gold standard» treatment of inflammation in ophthalmology, they have a number of serious side effects such as increasing of intraocular pressure and the risk of developing glaucoma, cataracts, activation of bacterial, viral infection and herpes. The positive effects of NSAIDs in comparison with corticosteroids are stable intraocular pressure (IOP), analgesic effect and reduce the risk of secondary infection. The three classes of NSADs are currently used in ophthalmology. They are phenylacetic acid (diclofenac and bromfenac nepafenak), indole acetic acid (indomethacin) and geteroariluksunoy acid (ketorolac). The last synthesized NSAIDs for ophthalmology are <b>amfenac</b> and bromfenac. Bromfenac is effective for the relief of the inflammatory symptoms of and fully complies with the requirements for the ideal anti-inflammatory drugs such as good a penetration ability, creating a sufficient concentration inside the eye, the activity of cyclooxygenase, inhibiting the progress of macular edema, a good analgesic effect, minimal toxicity, comfort of use patients.
