5|$|Al Anbar, {{the only}} Sunni-dominated {{province}} in Iraq, saw little {{fighting in the}} initial invasion. Following the fall of Baghdad it was occupied by the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division. Violence began on 28 April 2003 when 17 Iraqis were killed in Fallujah by U.S. soldiers during an anti-American demonstration. In early 2004 the U.S. Army relinquished command of the province to the Marines. By April 2004 the province was in full-scale revolt. Savage fighting occurred in both Fallujah and Ramadi {{by the end of}} 2004, including the Second Battle of Fallujah. Violence escalated throughout 2005 and 2006 as the two sides struggled to secure the Western Euphrates River Valley. During this time, <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> (AQI) became the province's main Sunni insurgent group and turned the provincial capital of Ramadi into its stronghold. The Marine Corps issued an intelligence report in late 2006 declaring that the province would be lost without a significant additional commitment of troops.|$|E
25|$|On April 2, 2005, {{the prison}} was {{attacked}} by more than 60 insurgents in the engagement known as the Battle of Abu Ghraib. In the two hours before being forced to retreat, the attackers suffered at least 50 casualties according to the U.S. military. Thirty-six persons at or in the prison, including U.S. military personnel, civilians and detainees, were injured in the attack. The attackers used small arms, rockets, and RPGs as weapons, and threw grenades over the walls. A suicide VBIED detonated just outside the front wall after Marines fired on it. Officials believe that the car bomb was intended to breach the prison wall, enabling an assault and/or mass escape for detainees. Insurgents also attacked military forces nearby on highways {{en route to the}} prison for reinforcement and used ambushes along the roads. <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> claimed responsibility.|$|E
25|$|In a major {{split in}} the ranks of Al Qaeda's organization, the Iraqi franchise, known as <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> covertly invaded Syria and the Levant and began {{participating}} in the ongoing Syrian Civil War, gaining enough support and strength to re-invade Iraq's western provinces under the name of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS/ISIL), taking over much of the country in a blitzkrieg-like action and combining the Iraq insurgency and Syrian Civil War into a single conflict. Due to their extreme brutality and a complete change in their overall ideology, Al Qaeda's core organization in Central Asia eventually denounced ISIS and directed their affiliates to cut off all ties with this organization. Many analysts believe that because of this schism, Al Qaeda and ISIL are now in a competition to retain the title of the world's most powerful terrorist organization.|$|E
50|$|Operation Larchwood 4 was an {{operation}} launched by B squadron of the British 22nd Special Air Service Regiment supported by US forces to attack an Al-Qaeda-occupied farmhouse in Yusufiyah, Baghdad Province, Iraq. The raid {{was a major}} success. As a result intelligence was gathered {{which led to the}} finding and killing of <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq's</b> leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi a few month's later.|$|R

The rifle and fist are also symbols of militancy. By positioning these symbols on top of the Quran, the image communicates the foundation of their mission in Islam, while the globe indicates their worldwide ambitions for their goals.|$|R

500|$|In an {{interview}} published by Israel Hayom magazine on June 12, 2015, Bush said that [...] "boots on the ground" [...] {{would be needed}} in order to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). He added that people had said during his Presidency that he should withdraw American troops from Iraq, but he chose the opposite, sending 30,000 more troops in order to defeat <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> and that <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> was defeated. Bush was also asked about Iran but declined to answer, stating that any answer he gives would be interpreted as undermining President Barack Obama.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 2006 several Iraqi tribes near Ramadi led by Sheikh Abdul Sattar Abu Risha revolted against various insurgent groups with <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b> [...] They formed the Anbar Awakening and helped turn the tide {{in favor of the}} US military.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, {{the bounty}} {{was reduced to}} $100,000, with Central Command {{spokesman}} Jamie Graybeal stating that [...] "The current assessment, based {{on a number of}} factors, shows that [...] is not ... an effective leader of <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> as he was last year," [...] although, as the spokesman stated, [...] "for security reasons," [...] he couldn't go into detail about the assessment. The reduction of reward money knocked al-Masri off the U.S. State Department [...] "Rewards for Justice" [...] program list and placed him on a Department of Defense list for people with lower bounties.|$|E
2500|$|Abu Qudama {{confessed to}} {{taking part in}} the attack on al-Askari mosque in Samarra and gave a {{detailed}} account of how the attack took place. Al-Rubaie said Iraqi security forces had yet to capture the mastermind of the mosque attack, Haitham al-Badri, an Iraqi and leader of one of <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq's</b> cells, who was later killed in an airstrike on August 2, 2007. Al-Rubaie said al-Badri, Abu Qudama, four Saudi nationals and two other Iraqis stormed the mosque Feb. 21, rounded up the shrine's guards, members of Iraq's Facility Protection Service, and bound their hands. The group then {{spent the rest of the}} night rigging the mosque with bombs. At dawn the next day, they detonated the explosives, bringing down the dome.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{military}} officials presented several {{concerns about the}} risks of the war, the report found that this was not taken into account in planning. [...] "The risks of internal strife <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> active Iranian pursuit of its interests, regional instability and <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> activity <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> were each explicitly identified before the invasion". A [...] "can-do" [...] attitude among {{military officials}} also led them to downplay dangers and setbacks during briefings.|$|R
2500|$|On 24 November 2007, {{military}} officials accused an Iranian special group of placing {{a bomb in}} a bird box that blew up at a popular animal market in central Baghdad. [...] "The group's purpose was {{to make it appear}} <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> was responsible for the attack", Admiral Smith said. He further emphasized there was [...] "no evidence Iran ordered the attack". In May 2008, Iraq said it had no evidence that Iran was supporting militants on Iraqi soil. Al-Sadr spokesman Al-Ubaydi said the presence of Iranian weapons in Iraq is [...] "quite normal," [...] since [...] "they are bought and sold and any party can buy them." ...|$|E
2500|$|With the {{primarily}} Sunni Al Anbar governorate to {{the west}} experiencing increased stability due to the U.S. troop surge and the Sunni rejection of <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> International Health [...] analysts hope to see improved health care there, as well. It {{remains to be seen}} whether non-governmental organizations and the Shiite-dominated central Iraqi government will take advantage of the enhanced security to enact sustainable services and other improvements. Local initiatives in June 2008 included contracting with the International Medical Corps for a comprehensive Anbar continuing medical education program, rights of return for expatriate health professionals, and an overhaul of nursing, with innovative programs paralleling the [...] "diploma" [...] nursing track of the West, and a goal of attracting women to nursing as a career (70% of Iraqi nurses are male).|$|E

50|$|Dr. Abd al-Rahman al-Nuaimi, {{who is on}} the Board of Trustees of the Global Anti-Aggression Campaign with Rabih Haddad, was {{designated}} in 2013 as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the United States Department of Treasury. He is accused of funneling money to <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> representatives <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> and Syria, Al-Shabaab in Somalia, and a Yemeni charity tied to Abd al-Wahhab Muhammad Abd al-Rahman al-Humayqani, who funneled the money to <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> <b>in</b> the Arabian Peninsula. Nuaimi and Haddad both currently serve on the board of GAAC together.|$|R
50|$|On December 7, 2006, the U.S. Department of the Treasury added al-Ali to {{its list}} of Specially Designated Global Terrorists, {{pursuant}} to Executive Order 13224, as a terrorist facilitator for providing financial support to <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> and other terrorist organizations. Specifically, al-Ali was a religious leader of a Kuwait-based terrorist cell and a recruiter of jihadists on behalf of <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> <b>in</b> both <b>Iraq</b> and Kuwait. He was also involved in the plotting of a foiled attack on U.S. and Kuwaiti targets in 2005.As outlined by the U.S. Treasury department, “this designation freezes any assets the designees may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits all financial and commercial transactions by any U.S. person with the designees. In addition, in accordance with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1624, the U.S. Government condemns those who incite others to acts of terrorism and violence”.|$|R
40|$|Terrorism {{has become}} a hot button topic since {{the rise of the}} radicalized Islamist {{organization}} <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda,</b> <b>in</b> the late 1990 ’s. However, the infamous attacks on September 11 th, 2001 are what truly brought this organization and its ideals to the forefront of the world’s attention. This paper provides a comprehensive and in depth analysis of the creation of <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> and traces the path of its connections to the Islamic State, which is currently the dominant radicalized Islamist organization. The Islamic State grew out of the <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> branch <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> and <b>in</b> addition to covering how that growth occurred, this paper will also look at how and why Iraq and also Syria were valuable incubators to both organizations. From the analysis of these countries’ situations, this paper will formulate an implication for a solution to the problems that have plagued them, as well as many other countries in the Middle East. This implication is to partition the land designated as the current countries of Iraq and Syria into multiple, smaller countries that specifically identify with one of the major ethnic/religious groups <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> and Syria. Through the partitioning of this land, the hope is to create a more peaceful and stable environment in the region. This new environment will then help extinguish the possibility of the creation of a power vacuum that could assist in the rise of another nefarious organization similar to or worse than either <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> or the Islamic State...|$|R

5000|$|Since the 2006 {{bombing of}} the al-Askari shrine, it had been under {{protection}} of local guards who were predominantly Sunni. Both American military and Iraqi security officials were worried that the guards had been infiltrated by <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> forces <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b> To counter this the Ministry of Interior in Baghdad were bringing in a new guard unit - predominantly Shiite. This {{changing of the guard}} is believed to have had some role in the timing of the attack. Abdul Sattar Abdul Jabbar, a prominent Sunni cleric, told Al Jazeera television that local Sunnis may have been provoked as he claimed [...] "the new guards had arrived at the shrine shouting sectarian slogans". Gunfire was reported around the shrine before the attack, [...] "which may have been related to the change of guards." [...] Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated that Policemen at the shrine (15 of them according to US military sources) had been detained for questioning along with [...] "an unspecified number of other suspects." [...] It was confirmed that [...] "the entire Iraqi security force responsible for guarding the mosque, the 3rd Battalion of the Salahuddin province police, was detained for investigation." [...] The Interior Ministry would only tell reporters that agents of [...] "a terrorist group" [...] had been arrested and were under interrogation. On Sunday 17 June 2007 Iraqi forces captured four additional suspects and their raid [...] "also turned up a compact disc showing attacks on U.S.-led troops, blasting caps and detonation wire, identification cards for access to al-Askari mosque and photographs depicting terrorist training exercises." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ahmad Hashim Abd al-Isawi was an <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> {{terrorist}} operating <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>in</b> {{the early}} 2000s.

[...] al-Isawi was subsequently handed over to Iraqi authorities and was awaiting his own trial when he testified at one of the resulting 2010 courts-martial. [...] His own trial was held some time before November 2013, and al-Isawi was executed by hanging for the killings.|$|R
40|$|What do Kobe Bryant, Aristotle, and the {{continuing}} U. S. response to {{the terrorist attacks on}} September 11, 2001, have in common? President Barack Obama told the New Yorker in early 2014, {{in response to a question}} regarding the seeming resurgence of <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> <b>in</b> Syria and <b>Iraq,</b> that “[t]he analogy we use around here sometimes, and I think is accurate, is if a jayvee team puts on Lakers uniforms that doesn’t make them Kobe Bryant. ” As this example demonstrates, the Obama Administration and others, in reference to the legality of the use of armed force against <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> and similar groups, have frequently employed an ancient tool of thought dating back to Aristotle—the use of analogies in reasoning. Reasoning by example, or making legal assessments by highlighting similarities and differences among examples, seems to dominate the Obama Administration’s discussions of the legality of its armed response to <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> and its associates. This is reflected in the above Kobe Bryant example, as well as in high-ranking U. S. government lawyers’ repeated use of the U. S. shoot-down of Japanese Admiral Yamamoto’s plane over the Pacific Ocean during World War II to legally justify today’s lethal targeting of individual <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> members. Yet this method of analogical legal reasoning is not restricted to U. S. government lawyers and other officials when arguing the legality of modern drone strikes. It is a hallmark of legal debates, inside and outside of government, regarding the use of military force against non-state terrorist groups in general since September 11, 2001. This Article’s primary point is simply that the inherent vagueness in international law and its interpretive methodologies, and the opaqueness particularly resident in the international legal regulation of the use of force against non-state actors, encourage resort to legal interpretation by analogy when addressing post- 9 / 11 law of war issues. Normatively, this Article warns that such an approach should be more transparent and that its use should be infused with greater methodological rigor. This scene-setting discussion leaves substantive analysis of discrete law of war analogies and process recommendations to a future law review article...|$|R
