40|$|Compiled {{and edited}} by G. R. CessfordThis paper {{discusses}} environmental interpretation for children. Included are definitions of interpretation; reasons for doing it; why emphasis upon children is important; the special requirements of effective interpretation for children, and {{some examples of}} techniques that have been used. The bulk of this paper comprises edited excerpts from the three undergraduate diploma dissertations {{that have been done}} on the topic: - Somerville, M.

40|$|We {{report the}} results of an {{analysis}} of all Spitzer/MIPS 24 micron observations of HD 209458 b, one of the touchstone objects in the study of irradiated giant planet atmospheres. Altogether we analyze 2. 5 transits, 3 eclipses, and a 58 -hour near-continuous observation designed to detect the planet's thermal phase curve. The results of our analysis are: (1) A mean transit depth of 1. 484 % +/- 0. 035 %, consistent with previous measurements and showing no evidence of variability in transit depth at the 3 % level. (2) A mean eclipse depth of 0. 332 % +/- 0. 026 %, somewhat higher than that previously reported for this system; this new value brings observations into better agreement with models. The dayside flux shows no evidence of variability at the 12 % level. (3) Eclipses in the system occur 32 s +/- 129 s earlier than would be expected from a circular orbit, which constrains the orbital quantity (e cos omega) to be 0. 00004 +/- 0. 00033. This result is fully consistent with a circular orbit and sets an upper limit of 140 m/s (3 sigma) on any eccentricity-induced velocity offset during transit. The phase curve observations (including one of the transits) exhibit an anomalous trend similar to the detector ramp seen in previous Spitzer/IRAC observations; by modeling this ramp we recover the system parameters. The photometry which follows the ramp and transit exhibits a gradual, ~ 0. 2 % decrease in flux, similar to that seen in pre-launch calibration data. The large uncertainties associated with this poorly-understood, likely instrumental effect prevent us from usefully constraining the planet's thermal phase curve. Our observations highlight the need for a thorough understanding of detector-related instrumental effects on long time scales when making the high-precision mid-infrared measurements planned for future missions such as EChO, SPICA, and JWST.

Methods: Subjects consisted of all consecutive children with ob-jectively confirmed thrombi for whom TPA thrombolysis was clinically ordered by the <b>authors.</b> <b>Initial</b> dosing used published standard dose (0. 1 – 0. 5 mg/kg per hour).
