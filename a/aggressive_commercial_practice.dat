Each section compares the European protection of <b>aggressive</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> (and also through European legislation implemented in Czech law) with the protection of those practices in U. S. law. The first part of thesis deals with the protection of consumers against <b>aggressive</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>practices.</b> In European law it mainly regulated by Directive on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices.</b> The Directive is implemented in Czech Republic in mainly in Consumer Protection Code and in the Advertising Code. Private protection against <b>aggressive</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> is embodied in provision of unfair competition of the Commercial Code. Protection of personality, privacy and personal data is another form of protection against aggressive practices. In U. S. law, public consumer protection is represented by Federal Trade Commission. In private law, consumers seek redress in court through actions for torts. In relations between competitors is the protection against <b>aggressive</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> regulated by unfair competition and by antirust law. Antitrust law in European Union is represented by 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty. Unfair Competition Law in the U. S. in the B 2 B market is the part of business torts. Antitrust law is represented by Federal Trade Commission and the Ministry of Justice. The last part of Diploma Thesis is concerned with <b>aggressive</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> that very often are accompanying the offers in time-sharing field and with children <b>aggressive</b> <b>commercials,</b> as a example of <b>aggressive</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> in practice...|$|R
5000|$|On {{a literal}} {{reading of the}} Directive, {{misleading}} or <b>aggressive</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> that would not affect the average consumer's economic behaviour, but would distort the economic behaviour of particular kinds of consumer, may be prohibited only by the general clause in Articles 5(1) to 5(3), and not by the specific clauses in Articles 6 to 9. This is because the latter provisions refer exclusively to the [...] "average consumer" [...] (although Article 9(c) also refers to the [...] "exploitation of any specific misfortune or circumstance of such gravity as to impair the consumer's judgement, of which the trader is aware..."). However, it might be fairer to read Articles 5(2)(b) and 5(3) as supplanting the references to the [...] "average consumer" [...] in Articles 6 to 9 in appropriate cases. The UK Government's Department of Trade and Industry published a consultation paper in December 2005, which suggested that that was indeed the intention. There is no clear basis in the text for the favoured interpretation, but the UK Government supports its interpretation {{with reference to the}} European Commission's Explanatory Memorandum. This could be important because depending on {{the answer to this question}} it may be easier or harder to pin down a breach of the Directive.|$|R
40|$|EC law has {{introduced}} special rules into Italian legal system {{to preserve the}} integrity of consumer consent in C 2 B contracts. Over the time, the need to grant consumer centrality, in relation to choices, in the competitive community market, {{has led to an}} extension of his protection in the formation of consent phase. Changes concern both defects and remedies. Along with traditional defects provided for by the civil code (i. e. incapacity, mistake, duress, and fraudolent misrepresentation), new rules have introduced protections to safeguard the weak contracting party’s carefulness, freedom and information. New duties to inform are placed on businesses in contracts negotiated away from business premises; distance selling, distance selling of financial services, and timeshare contracts; contracts for the purchase of package holidays; consumer credit, and electricity and gas supply contracts, {{as well as in the}} labelling of non-food products, and in the sale of dangerous products. New consent defects may be found in contracts concluded by the consumer in pending suits of violations to antitrust regulations. New bans on deceptive or <b>aggressive</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> impose businesses to behave according to general principles of fair dealing and good faith from the very pre-contractual phase. The European contract law draftings confirm the extension of protections warranting the integrity of consent. In order to establish the nature and scope of the possible protection remedies, a coordination with the civil code rules applying to invalid contracts was needed. Last, the most effective remedies to ensure consumers a real protection of the integrity of their choices were explored with reference to the competitive market context, i. e. the relevant scenario of the contracts under examination...|$|R
40|$|The {{commercial}} activity primarily presumes the {{compliance with the}} legal provisions relating to the acts and deeds of commerce. The {{commercial activity}} is, from a legal perspective, a correct exercise of the ownership and free initiative by the legal person in the commercial activities, the business conduct being necessary to circumscribe the legal rules that govern the commercial market. This article has as starting point {{on the one hand}} the need for legal provisions ensuring a real protection to the Romanian consumers exposed to unfair trade practices, {{and on the other hand}} of some comprehensive legal stipulations on tradesmen’s contravention and criminal liability that show an unfair competitive conduct. The general regulatory framework regarding the unfair competition consists of the Law no. 11 / 1991 on combating the unfair competition, the legal stipulations which relate to the European provisions on the matter, namely the Directive 2005 / 29 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council from May 11 th 2005 concerning unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> of enterprises in the internal market to consumers and amending the Directive 84 / 450 /EEC of the Council, of the Directives 97 / 7 /EC, 98 / 27 /EC and 2002 / 65 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) no. 2006 / 2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The European legislation includes the stipulations regarding the unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> prohibited in the E. U. space, as well as the stipulations relating to the economic interests of consumers who enter into transactions with tradesmen. In this respect, the European regulations deem unfair trade practices those acts or actions that violate the principles of professional diligence and which may influence the commercial decisions of consumers, being categorized as misleading <b>practices</b> and <b>aggressive</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>practices.</b> In accordance with the provisions of the Law no. 11 / 1991 on combating the unfair competition, with the ulterior amendments and supplements, unfair competition represents the <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> of the enterprise that contravenes the fair usages and the general principle of good faith and which cause or may cause damage to any market participants. According to art. 301 of the old Criminal Code, the unfair competition consists in the manufacture or circulation of goods bearing a false designation of origin or false indications of origin and application on the products put in circulation of false mentions regarding the patents or the use of certain commercial names or of the denominations of industrial or trade organizations, in order to mislead the beneficiaries. In the new context of the European trading market where our country is a party and which involves certain rigors of expression and the development of online commercial transactions, the specific legislation requires an adaptation to the new conditions and a serious and sustained involvement of the competent bodies in combating and punishing the unfair competition practices...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUnfair <b>Commercial</b> <b>Practices</b> Directive {{remains one}} of the most ambitious acts of {{secondary}} legislation adopted in the field of consumer protection over the past decade. This legal instrument seeks to establish a common European understanding of “unfairness” in business-to-consumer legal relations. Hereby Directive introduced a comprehensive regulatory regime applied to all types of commercial activities that can influence the economic behavior of consumers, covering any business-to-consumer <b>commercial</b> <b>practice</b> before, during and after a transaction, thus including marketing, negotiation, sales practices and after-sales conduct. Unfair <b>Commercial</b> <b>Practices</b> Directive into Lithuanian legal system was transposed by adopting a completely new legal act – Law on Prohibition of Unfair Business-to-Consumer <b>Commercial</b> <b>Practices</b> of the Republic of Lithuania. The implementation of the Unfair <b>Commercial</b> <b>Practices</b> Directive in Lithuania led to a split-up between misleading business-to-consumer <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> and misleading business-to-business advertising regulation regimes. Implementing act among other rules introduced into the national legal system provisions on the prohibition of misleading <b>commercial</b> <b>practices,</b> ensuring that consumers are not misled, thus enabling them to make informed and reasonable choices. The purpose of this article is to examine the norms of national act, implementing the prohibition of misleading <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> into the national legal system in the context of implementing provisions of the other Member States and to reveal core national regulation and application problems. Also, having in mind that in the text of the Directive a distinction between misleading actions and misleading omissions is made, it is analyzed whether the clear line between the application of these rules is made in legal practice. In conclusion authors formulate key recommendations for consumer protection institutions and courts, applying the rules on misleading <b>commercial</b> <b>practices...</b>|$|R

40|$|Since the {{adoption}} of the European directive on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices,</b> its provisions started to apply alongside the existing sector-specific European legislation on consumer protection. With the aim of ensuring a coherent system of European consumer law, the directive stated that, in the case of conflict between its rules and other Community law regulating specific aspects of unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices,</b> the latter shall prevail and apply to those aspects. The directive, however, did not mandate any enforcement mechanism at the national level. The Italian legislation which implemented the European directive conferred a general enforcement power on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> to the national antitrust authority. Italian law was not, however, very clear regarding the competence of the agency in markets subject to the oversight of a different sector-specific authority. This issue was raised before the Italian administrative law Court which, at first, seemed to limit the general competence of the antitrust authority in fields where the contested practices were also considered by sector-specific regulation. For this reason, the European Commission started an infringement proceeding against Italy for not having correctly implemented the directive on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices.</b> As a consequence, a recent reform in Italian law conferred the antitrust authority an exclusive competence to combat unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> also in regulated sectors, after having consulted the sector-specific regulator, apart when the breach of sector-specific regulation does not result in an unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practice.</b> After {{the adoption}} of this provision, the Italian administrative judge finally interpreted the law on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practice</b> consistently with the European directive. The Court denied that {{the adoption of}} secondary legislation by a national sector-specific regulators can exclude the application of the general provisions on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> and affirmed the relevant enforcement competence of the antitrust authority also in regulated sectors. In the light of these different approaches, this paper will attempt to examine the benefits and the drawbacks of the enforcement mechanisms endorsed by the Italian Courts and legislator. The aim of the work is to assess, from a legal perspective, which role should the general antitrust authority play in the enforcement of unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> in markets subject to sector-specific regulation. </p...|$|R
