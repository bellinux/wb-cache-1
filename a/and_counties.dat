5|$|The Han Empire {{was divided}} by {{hierarchical}} political {{divisions in the}} following descending order: provinces (zhou), commanderies (jun), <b>and</b> <b>counties</b> (xian). This model of local government was adopted from the previous government structure of the Qin dynasty.|$|E

5|$|There {{had already}} been public debate {{on the fate of}} retired cricketers, <b>and</b> <b>counties</b> had {{improved}} pay and conditions for their professional players.

5|$|There {{have been}} at least thirty-two {{counties}} established by Texas law that no longer exist.

5|$|Virginia {{is divided}} into 95 {{counties}} and 38 independent cities, the latter acting in many ways as county-equivalents. This general method of treating cities <b>and</b> <b>counties</b> on par with each other is unique to Virginia; only three other independent cities exist elsewhere in the United States, each in a different state. Virginia limits the authority of cities <b>and</b> <b>counties</b> to countermand laws expressly allowed by the Virginia General Assembly under {{what is known as}} Dillon's Rule. In addition to independent cities, there are also incorporated towns which operate under their own governments, but are part of a county. Finally there are hundreds of unincorporated communities within the counties. Virginia does not have any further political subdivisions, such as villages or townships.|$|E
5|$|A main {{sector of}} the {{industry}} is the publishing sector. It ranks 9th out of all states {{in the number of}} establishments, which is 1,015, 10th in the number of employees, and 13th in its contribution to the gross state product. McGraw-Hill operates a division in Columbus, Brown Publishing Company distributes over 70 publications throughout the state, and was recently sold to Ohio Community Media; American Legal Publishing Corporation, headquartered in Cincinnati, codifies ordinances for 1,800 cities <b>and</b> <b>counties,</b> and Knight-Ridder has its roots in Akron, although now headquartered in California.|$|E

5|$|Governor Harrison had wide-ranging {{powers in}} the new territory, {{including}} authority to appoint territorial officials and the legislature, as well as authority to divide the territory into smaller political districts <b>and</b> <b>counties.</b> One of his primary responsibilities was to obtain title to Indian lands that would allow future settlement and increase the territory's population, a requirement for statehood. Harrison was eager to expand the territory for personal reasons as well; his political fortunes were tied to Indiana's eventual statehood. On February 8, 1803, when President Jefferson reappointed Harrison as the Indiana territorial governor, he also granted Harrison the authority to negotiate and conclude treaties with the Indians.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish left a deep mark on Texas. Their European {{livestock}} caused mesquite {{to spread}} inland while farmers tilled and irrigated the land, changing the landscape forever. The Spanish language provided the names {{for many of}} the rivers, towns, <b>and</b> <b>counties</b> that currently exist, and Spanish architectural concepts still flourish. Although Texas eventually adopted much of the Anglo-American legal system, many Spanish legal practices were retained, including the concept of a homestead exemption and community property.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia General Assembly is {{the oldest}} {{continuous}} law-making body in the New World. The state government was ranked most effective by the Pew Center on the States in both 2005 and 2008. It is unique in how it treats cities <b>and</b> <b>counties</b> equally, manages local roads, and prohibits its governors from serving consecutive terms. Virginia's economy has many sectors: agriculture in the Shenandoah Valley; federal agencies in Northern Virginia, including {{the headquarters of the}} U.S. Department of Defense and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); and military facilities in Hampton Roads, the site of the region's main seaport.|$|E

5|$|The {{executive}} {{branch of the}} government is headed by a mayor and vice-mayor. As in other South Korean cities <b>and</b> <b>counties,</b> the mayor is elected directly, while the vice-mayor is appointed. As of 2010, the mayor is Choi Yang-sik, who {{was appointed to the}} position on July 1, 2010 after winning the local election held on June 2 of the same year. He is Gyeongju's fifth mayor to be directly elected, the sixth to preside over the city in its present form, and the 31st mayor since 1955. Like most heads of government in the Yeongnam region, {{he is a member of}} the conservative Grand National Party.|$|E
5|$|In 1789, {{the area}} of modern-day Belgium was divided into two independently-governed polities, both part of the Holy Roman Empire. The Austrian Netherlands, which {{included}} most of the territory of modern-day Belgium, had been in existence {{since the end of}} the War of the Spanish Succession in 1714 when the Habsburg Monarchy annexed the section called the Spanish Netherlands from the Spanish branch of the house. The traditional principalities, duchies <b>and</b> <b>counties</b> surviving from the Middle Ages retained great regional autonomy. The economy of the Austrian Netherlands developed little, as its neighboring states imposed high export tariffs and the port of Antwerp remained blocked by the Dutch. Although Enlightenment ideals developed among the urban bourgeoisie, most of the population remained suspicious of education and extremely politically conservative. The Catholic church was particularly influential, despite the attempts of Emperor Joseph II to reduce its power.|$|E
5|$|Lock Haven {{was laid}} out as a town in 1833, and it became the county seat in 1839, when the county was created out of parts of Lycoming and Centre counties. Incorporated as a borough in 1840 and as a city in 1870, Lock Haven prospered in the 19thcentury largely because of timber and transportation. The forests of Clinton County <b>and</b> <b>counties</b> upriver held a huge supply of white pine and hemlock as well as oak, ash, maple, poplar, cherry, beech, and magnolia. The wood was used locally {{for such things as}} frame houses, shingles, canal boats, and wooden bridges, and whole logs were floated to Chesapeake Bay and on to Baltimore, to make spars for ships. Log driving and log rafting, {{competing}} forms of transporting logs to sawmills, began along the West Branch around 1800. By 1830, slightly before the founding of the town, the lumber industry was well established.|$|E
