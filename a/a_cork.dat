5|$|Birth {{usually takes}} place in the water and {{typically}} produces a single pup weighing 1.4 to 2.3kg (3 to 5lb). Twins occur in 2% of births; however, usually only one pup survives. At birth, the eyes are open, ten teeth are visible, and the pup has a thick coat of baby fur. Mothers have been observed to lick and fluff a newborn for hours; after grooming, the pup's fur retains so much air, the pup floats like <b>a</b> <b>cork</b> and cannot dive. The fluffy baby fur is replaced by adult fur after about 13 weeks.|$|E
5|$|By 1944, {{space was}} running short, and Monsanto began {{negotiations}} {{to acquire the}} Runnymede Playhouse in the wealthy residential Dayton suburb of Oakwood. Built in 1927, the Playhouse was a leisure facility that included an outdoor swimming pool, a ballroom, a squash court, a tennis court with <b>a</b> <b>cork</b> floor and a stage for community theater. It had showers with Italian marble and a -story garage. The estate was owned by the Talbott Realty Company, which was controlled by Thomas's wife's family. The Talbotts were among the heirs of the Delco company, which was by then a part of General Motors.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins lead solitary existences when {{out at sea}} {{and this}} part of their life has been little studied as the task of finding even one bird on the vast ocean is formidable. When at sea, the Atlantic puffin bobs about like <b>a</b> <b>cork,</b> {{propelling}} itself through the water with powerful thrusts of its feet and keeping itself turned into the wind, even when resting and apparently asleep. It spends much time each day preening to keep its plumage in order and spread oil from the preen gland. Its downy under-plumage remains dry and provides thermal insulation. In common with other seabirds, its upper surface is black and underside white. This provides camouflage, with aerial predators unable to observe the bird against the dark watery background and underwater attackers failing to notice it as it blends in with the bright sky above the waves.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1910 World Series, <b>a</b> <b>corked</b> {{baseball}} was secretly introduced into professional baseball {{for the first}} time.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Otis {{admitted}} that he used <b>a</b> <b>corked</b> bat during part of his Major League career.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's <b>a</b> <b>corking</b> story," [...] {{said the}} reporter. [...] "That {{decanter}} is {{exactly like the}} one that John W. Gates always sets out during an interview." ...|$|R
25|$|Baseball (ball): Traditionally {{made quite}} similarly, with <b>a</b> <b>cork</b> center (today usually rubber) wrapped tightly with string and encased in leather.|$|E
25|$|In 1804 <b>a</b> <b>cork</b> {{life jacket}} was {{available}} for sale. The Sporting Magazine October, 1804, Vol.XXV, No.147, Page 129. MALLISON's SEAMAN'S FRIEND.|$|E
25|$|Soon after Miró {{also began}} his Spanish Dancer series of works. These simple collages, {{were like a}} {{conceptual}} counterpoint to his paintings. In Spanish Dancer (1928) he combines <b>a</b> <b>cork,</b> a feather and a hatpin onto a blank sheet of paper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive me, Tenny, old boy," [...] cried Clayton. [...] "It {{certainly}} IS <b>a</b> <b>corking</b> idea--I {{never should}} have suspected you of it. You're quite sure it's original, are you?" ...|$|R
50|$|According to {{a report}} in the Stockton Record, Sprague said he used performance-enhancing {{substances}} later banned by Major League Baseball and admitted hitting a home run with <b>a</b> <b>corked</b> bat.|$|R
6000|$|... "But you're crooked," [...] {{retorted}} the King, [...] "and that debars you. You may be <b>a</b> <b>corking</b> good lawyer, Mr. Popp, but I {{must ask}} you to withdraw your remarks." ...|$|R
25|$|Kerry {{have played}} in just one Munster Minor Hurling Championship Final, in 1938, when they lost to <b>a</b> <b>Cork</b> team that {{included}} the great Christy Ring. They have however won and played {{in a number of}} All-Ireland B Finals.|$|E
25|$|Douglas started {{elementary}} school in Winnipeg. He completed his elementary education after returning to Glasgow. He worked as a soap boy in a barber shop, rubbing lather into tough whiskers, then {{dropped out of high}} school at 13 after landing a job in <b>a</b> <b>cork</b> factory. The owner offered to pay Douglas's way through night school so that he could learn Portuguese and Spanish, languages that would enable him to become <b>a</b> <b>cork</b> buyer. However, the family returned to Winnipeg when the war ended and Douglas entered the printing trades. He served a five-year apprenticeship and worked as a Linotype operator finally acquiring his journeyman's papers, but decided to return to school to pursue his ambition to become an ordained minister.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union {{launched}} World's first satellite of the Earth into an elliptical low Earth orbit on 4 October 1957. A missile {{must be used}} {{to start}} any satellite, space ship. After 1957 Soviet satellites, and later space ships, often fly from the Soviet Union into space as <b>a</b> <b>cork</b> from the bottle with champagne.|$|E
50|$|Barrera {{was accused}} in 1988 of using <b>a</b> <b>corked</b> bat by the Tigres del México club. The umpires {{disagreed}} and the Mexican League fined the Tigres one million pesos for defaming Barrera.|$|R
50|$|The California Wine Club {{partnered with}} ReCork, <b>a</b> natural wine <b>cork</b> {{recycling}} program, in July 2011 to conduct <b>a</b> nationwide <b>cork</b> drive.|$|R
6000|$|LEMMY. Oh, ah! Look 'ere, it was <b>a</b> <b>corked</b> bottle. Now, tyke care, tyke care, 'aughty! Daon't curl yer lip! I shall myke a clean breast o' my betryal {{when the}} time comes! ...|$|R
25|$|If {{a needle}} is rubbed on a lodestone or other magnet, the needle becomes magnetized. When it is {{inserted}} in <b>a</b> <b>cork</b> or piece of wood, {{and placed in}} a bowl of water it becomes a compass. Such devices were universally used as compass until the invention of the box-like compass with a 'dry' pivoting needle sometime around 1300.|$|E
25|$|Between 1729 and 1736, two English scientists, Stephen Gray and Jean Desaguliers, {{performed}} {{a series of}} experiments which showed that <b>a</b> <b>cork</b> or other object {{as far away as}} 800 or 900 feet (245–275m) could be electrified by connecting it via a charged glass tube to materials such as metal wires or hempen string. They found that other materials, such as silk, would not convey the effect.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} lifesaving {{services}} were formed that the personal safety of boat crews heading out in pulling boats in generally horrific sea conditions was addressed. The modern life jacket is generally credited to one Captain Ward, a Royal National Lifeboat Institution inspector in the United Kingdom, who created <b>a</b> <b>cork</b> vest in 1854 to be worn by lifeboat crews for both weather protection and buoyancy.|$|E
5000|$|The draw between Kilkenny and Waterford on 7 August was {{the first}} time a replay was {{required}} to decide an All-Ireland semi-final since 2003, when Wexford <b>an</b> <b>Cork</b> played out <b>a</b> 3-17 to 2-20 tie.|$|R
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>Cork</b> {{began their}} defence of their {{championship}} titles in 1971, Horgan {{was moved to}} centre-back for Cork's opening game. He scored two points from that position, however, Limerick were the winners by 2-16 to 2-14.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, former {{player and}} Major League manager Phil Garner {{admitted}} in January 2010 on a Houston radio station {{that he used}} <b>a</b> <b>corked</b> bat against Gaylord Perry and [...] "hit a home run" [...] with it.|$|R
25|$|Purchases between tenants and landlords were {{negotiated}} by Sheehan and the ILLA branches after O'Brien and Sheehan formed <b>a</b> <b>Cork</b> Advisory Committee in September 1904, to mediate between landlords and tenants in their negotiations. They thereby achieved purchase terms with low interest annuities which produced an exceptionally high take-up of land purchase. Munster tenants availed of land purchase in higher numbers {{than in any}} other province.|$|E
25|$|In 1890 Cork and Wexford did {{battle in}} the All-Ireland final. The game was a {{controversial}} one and was marred by ill-tempered behaviour. <b>A</b> <b>Cork</b> player had his toe broken {{by one of his}} Wexford counterparts. Cork captain Dan Lane walked his men off the field in protest. At the time Cork were trailing by 2-2 to 1-6; however, the GAA's Central Council later backed Cork and the team were awarded the All-Ireland title.|$|E
25|$|Jim Crawford, a {{policeman}} then aged 23, and Herb Jones, a contractor, were credited with saving {{as many as}} 50 lives between {{the start of the}} heavy flooding during the late evening until daybreak. Crawford supplied gas for Jones' boat, and they set out into the river, which flooded as high as the telephone wires. Rescuing people from their porches, second-floor windows, or roofs, Crawford described that he and Jones bounced around like <b>a</b> <b>cork,</b> and dodged debris, houses and telephone poles.|$|E
5000|$|Despite this shortcoming, Gilligan said: [...] "After his superb exposé of Shirley Porter, the gerrymanderer of Westminster City council, Hosken {{has again}} managed to turn unpromising {{territory}} into <b>a</b> <b>corking</b> read. He is the John Grisham of local government." ...|$|R
6000|$|When {{the others}} had labored out, at half-past ten, Babbitt turned to his wife, pleading, [...] "Charley said he had <b>a</b> <b>corking</b> time and we must lunch--said they wanted to have us {{up to the house}} for dinner before long." ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{received}} a lukewarm review in Film Daily, as having some [...] "humorous touches scattered through" [...] but overlong. [...] Variety wrote that [...] "for a cheap picture, it should more than get the production cost back and show <b>a</b> <b>corking</b> profit." ...|$|R
25|$|Small vessels {{headed to}} assist her {{including}} the Port of Dover tugs Lady Brassey and Lady Crundall, trawlers, dredgers and a destroyer. As Maloja steamed astern {{and unable to}} stop, the rescue vessels were unable to get alongside to take off survivors. A heavy sea was running and the hundreds who crowded her decks could only don <b>a</b> <b>cork</b> lifejacket, jump overboard and try to swim clear. A number of her rafts either were launched or floated clear, {{and some of her}} survivors managed to board them. Maloja sank 24 minutes after being mined, followed by Empress of Fort William which sank about 40 minutes after being mined.|$|E
25|$|Exposure {{to extreme}} {{temperature}} and oxygen accounts for Madeira's stability; an opened bottle will survive unharmed indefinitely. As long as <b>a</b> <b>cork</b> {{is put into}} the top of the bottle to prevent the effects of evaporation, fruit flies and dust, a vintage Madeira, once opened, can last for decades. Properly sealed in bottles, {{it is one of the}} longest-lasting wines; Madeiras have been known to survive over 200 years in excellent condition. It is not uncommon to see 150-year-old Madeiras for sale at stores that specialize in rare wine. Vintages dating back to 1780 are known to exist. The oldest bottle that has come onto the market is a 1715 Terrantez.|$|E
25|$|Woody dicots {{and many}} nonwoody dicots have {{secondary}} growth originating from their lateral or secondary meristems: the vascular cambium and the cork cambium or phellogen. The vascular cambium forms between the xylem and phloem in the vascular bundles and connects {{to form a}} continuous cylinder. The vascular cambium cells divide to produce secondary xylem to the inside and secondary phloem to the outside. As the stem increases in diameter due to production of secondary xylem and secondary phloem, the cortex and epidermis are eventually destroyed. Before the cortex is destroyed, <b>a</b> <b>cork</b> cambium develops there. The cork cambium divides to produce waterproof cork cells externally and sometimes phelloderm cells internally. Those three tissues form the periderm, which replaces the epidermis in function. Areas of loosely packed cells in the periderm that function in gas exchange are called lenticels.|$|E
5000|$|Cash {{summed up}} his success as follows: [...] "I owe my success to {{expansion}} pitching, a short right-field fence, and my hollow bats." [...] Later in his career, Cash claimed he used <b>a</b> <b>corked</b> bat in 1961, even showing Sports Illustrated how he made one.|$|R
6000|$|As he {{was leaving}} the club Babbitt heard Chum Frink protesting to Gunch, [...] "--don't know what's got into him. Last Sunday Doc Drew preached <b>a</b> <b>corking</b> sermon about decency in {{business}} and Babbitt kicked about that, too. Near 's I can figure out--" ...|$|R
50|$|Also {{commonly}} included {{were small}} glass test tubes, a spatula, <b>a</b> funnel, <b>corks,</b> <b>a</b> small bottle brush and {{a test tube}} rack. Larger sets also included a methylated spirit burner for heating.|$|R
