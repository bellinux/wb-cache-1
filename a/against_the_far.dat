25|$|Operations in Burma {{over the}} {{remainder}} of 1942 and in 1943 were a study of military frustration. The United Kingdom could only just maintain three active campaigns, and immediate offensives in both the Middle East and Far East proved impossible {{due to lack of}} resources. The Middle East won out, being closer to home and a campaign <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> more dangerous Germans.|$|E
25|$|Writer and comics {{historian}} Mark Evanier {{has suggested}} without confirmation that Kirby also designed the basic image of Daredevil's initial costume, though Everett modified it. That original costume design {{was a combination}} of black, yellow, and red, reminiscent of acrobat tights. Wally Wood introduced Daredevil's modern red costume in issue #7 in which Daredevil's battle <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> physically-superior Sub-Mariner {{has become one of the}} most iconic stories of the series.|$|E
25|$|Head lice (especially in children) have been, {{and still}} are, subject to various {{eradication}} campaigns. Unlike body lice, head lice {{are not the}} vectors of any known diseases. Except for rare secondary infections that result from scratching at bites, head lice are harmless, {{and they have been}} regarded by some as essentially a cosmetic rather than a medical problem. Head lice infestations might be beneficial in helping to foster a natural immune response against lice which helps humans in defense <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> more dangerous body louse, which is capable of transmission of dangerous diseases.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, the Red Army {{pushed the}} Eastern Front towards Lithuania. The Soviets invaded and {{occupied}} Lithuania {{by the end of}} 1944. As forced conscription into Red Army and Stalinist repressions intensified, thousands of Lithuanians used forests in the countryside as a natural refuge. These spontaneous groups became more organized and centralized culminating in the establishment of the Union of Lithuanian Freedom Fighters in February 1948. In their documents, the partisans emphasized that their ultimate goal is recreation of independent Lithuania. As the partisan war continued, {{it became clear that the}} West would not interfere in Eastern Europe (see Western betrayal) and that the partisans had no chance of success <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> stronger opponent. Eventually, the partisans made an explicit and conscious decision not to accept any new members. The leadership of the partisans was destroyed in 1953 thus effectively ending the partisan war, though individual fighters held out until the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|On July 17, 1864, {{just before}} the Battle of Peachtree Creek on July 20, 1864, Confederate President Jefferson Davis {{replaced}} General Joseph E. Johnston as commander of the Army of Tennessee defending Atlanta with the aggressive Lieutenant General, temporary General, John Bell Hood. On July 22, 1864, Hood ordered Lieutenant General Hardee to maneuver around the left flank of the Union Army east of Atlanta for a surprise attack while Major General Cheatham, then in command of Hood's former corps, {{was to make a}} diversionary attack {{on the front of the}} Union force and the cavalry commander, Major General Joseph Wheeler, would attack their supply line. The Battle of Atlanta, fought east and south of the city and near the Union supply lines further east at Decatur, Georgia, ensued. During a hard day of fighting after a night march to get into position, Hardee's men succeeded in bending back the Union left flank and retaking some breastworks that had been built by the Confederates earlier. Union Major General James B. McPherson, who was killed during the battle, anticipated the Confederate maneuver <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> end of his flank, reshaped his line and sent reinforcements to the flank.|$|E

Then the screw moves forward horizontally acting more like a [...] "battering ram" [...] than an auger by intermittently pushing the cake in [...] "impulses" [...] <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> end of the press. While producing slightly less phenolic press fraction, the disadvantage of this press is the decrease efficiency that is almost on par with batch presses.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese army {{provided}} {{military support}} to the Japanese-backed Provisional Priamur Government based in Vladivostok <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Moscow-backed <b>Far</b> Eastern Republic. <b>The</b> continued Japanese presence concerned the United States, which suspected that Japan had territorial designs on Siberia and <b>the</b> Russian <b>Far</b> East. Subjected to intense diplomatic pressure by the United States and the United Kingdom, and facing increasing domestic opposition due to the economic and human cost, the administration of Prime Minister Kato Tomosaburo withdrew the Japanese forces in October 1922.|$|R
25|$|Responding to {{the loss}} of Fort Harrison and the {{increasing}} Federal threat against Richmond, Gen. Robert E. Lee directed an offensive <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Union <b>far</b> right flank on October 7. After routing the Federal cavalry from their position covering Darbytown Road, Field's and Hoke's divisions assaulted the main Union defensive line along New Market Road and were repulsed. The Federals were not dislodged, and Lee withdrew into the Richmond defenses.|$|R
2500|$|Despite his dapper, dandyish appearance, McCourt had a {{reputation}} as a hard character. He took an uncompromising view <b>against</b> both <b>the</b> <b>far</b> left and far right, and was known as a social liberal. The 4-Skins and their colleagues, Cockney Rejects, met and overcame violent opposition from both militant leftists and right-wing extremists. The Italian Oi! band, Asociale, wrote the song [...] "Hoxton Tom for President" [...] in appreciation of McCourt's street-based politics.|$|R
2500|$|After {{witnessing}} {{the impact of}} fascist movements on Europe's societies, Sadoveanu-Evan combined her feminist stance with the cause of anti-fascism. Together with actress Lucia Sturdza Bulandra, she was active within Frontul Feminin (Feminine Front), an organism designed to defend women's rights <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> right threat, and presided upon by Nădejde. According to researcher Ștefania Mihalache, the Front, which was created in 1936 and soon after published a manifesto, had a Marxist bias, centered on [...] "the woman's right to work". Sadoveanu's made trips abroad, and attended, in Paris, the exhibit marking the 50 years since the Symbolist Manifesto.|$|E
2500|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{his term}} McNamara also opposed an anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system {{proposed}} for installation in the U.S. in defense against Soviet missiles, arguing the $40 billion [...] "in itself is not the problem; the penetrability of the proposed shield is the problem." [...] Under pressure to proceed with the ABM program after {{it became clear that the}} Soviets had begun a similar project, McNamara finally agreed to a [...] "light" [...] system which he believed could protect <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> smaller number of Chinese missiles. However, he never believed it was wise for the United States to move in that direction because of psychological risks of relying too much on nuclear weaponry and that there would be pressure from many directions to build a larger system than would be militarily effective.|$|E
2500|$|Influenced by South Africa's {{reluctance}} to use black soldiers {{in what was}} widely considered a [...] "white man's war", Southern Rhodesia did not recruit blacks in large numbers until 1916, {{when the number of}} potential white volunteers not already in uniform became too small to merit further drafts. The Rhodesia Native Regiment (RNR) was formed in that year to join the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment in East Africa, and included 2,507 men by 1918. Organisers expected that most black volunteers would come from the Matabele people, famous for its martial tradition, and therefore originally named the unit the [...] "Matabele Regiment"; however, when the ranks proved to be ethnically diverse, the name was changed. Led by white officers, the black soldiers served with distinction in East Africa, soon becoming regarded as formidable bush fighters. Pitted against the German Generalmajor Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck—who was mounting a successful guerrilla campaign <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> larger Allied forces—they remained in East Africa {{for the rest of the}} war, returning home only in December 1918, soon after von Lettow-Vorbeck surrendered at Abercorn in Northern Rhodesia on 25 November. The RNR was thereupon dissolved.|$|E

50|$|In June 1920, the United States and its allied {{coalition}} partners withdrew from Vladivostok, after the capture {{and execution of}} the White Army leader, Admiral Kolchak, by the Red Army. However, the Japanese decided to stay, primarily due to fears of the spread of communism so close to Japan and Japanese-controlled Korea and Manchuria. The Japanese Army provided military support to the Japanese-backed Provisional Priamurye Government, based in Vladivostok, <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Moscow-backed <b>Far</b> Eastern Republic.|$|R

LGBT rights activist Peter Tatchell has accused UAF of a selective approach to bigotry: [...] "UAF commendably opposes the BNP and EDL but it is silent about Islamist fascists who promote anti-Semitism, homophobia, sexism and sectarian attacks on non-extremist Muslims.

2500|$|With {{increased}} {{military aid}} from the United States, the 5,000-man Guatemalan Army mounted a large pacification effort in the departments of Zacapa and Izabal in October 1966 dubbed [...] "Operation Guatemala". Col. Carlos Arana Osorio was appointed commander of the [...] "Zacapa-Izabal Military Zone" [...] and {{took charge of the}} counter-terror program with guidance and training from 1,000 US Green Berets. Under Colonel Arana's jurisdiction, military strategists armed and fielded various paramilitary death squads to supplement regular army and police units in clandestine terror operations <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>FAR's</b> civilian support base. Personnel, weapons, funds and operational instructions were supplied to these organizations by the armed forces. The death squads operated with impunity – permitted by the government to kill any civilians deemed to be either insurgents or insurgent collaborators. The civilian membership of the army's paramilitary units consisted largely of right-wing fanatics with ties to the MLN, founded and led by Mario Sandoval Alarcón, a former participant in the 1954 coup. By 1967, the Guatemalan army claimed to have 1,800 civilian paramilitaries under its direct control.|$|R

40|$|Waiting for the {{revolution}} is {{a volume of}} essays examining the diverse currents of British left-wing politics from 1956 to the present day. The book is designed to complement <b>the</b> previous volume, <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> grain: <b>The</b> <b>far</b> left in Britain from 1956, bringing together young and established academics and writers to discuss the realignments and fissures that maintain leftist politics into the twenty-first century. The two books endeavour to historicise the British left, detailing but also seeking to understand the diverse currents that comprise 'the far left'. Their objective is less to intervene in ongoing issues relevant {{to the left and}} politics more generally, than to uncover and explore the traditions and issues that have preoccupied leftist groups, activists and struggles. To this end, the book will appeal to scholars and anyone interested in British politics...|$|R

This proved--Frau Ebermann groaned again at the way the world falls to bits when one is sick--proved that Anna had forgotten to shut the outer door of the flat when she went to the chemist.

Now she understood. Whatever {{may have been the}} first worship to which this place was dedicated, Christians had usurped it, and set up here the sacred symbol of their faith, awful enough to look upon in such surroundings. Doubtless, also, the shell-shaped basin at the entrance had served the worshippers in this underground chapel as a stoup for holy water.|$|E

Quest replaced the instrument in his pocket, sprang through the opening and ran for the tower house. Behind him, on its way to New York, he could see a freight train coming along. He could hear, too, Red Gallagher's roar of anger. It was less than fifty yards, yet already, as he reached the shelter of the tower, the thunder of the freight sounded in Quest's ears. He glanced around. Red Gallagher and his mate were racing almost beside it towards him. He rushed up the narrow stairs into the signal room, tearing open his coat to show his official badge.|$|E
