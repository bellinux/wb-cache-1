5|$|Due to {{similarities}} between the perpetrators, the murders were compared by Czech media and experts to a mass murder that took place two years before in Frenštát pod Radhoštěm, another Moravian town lying 90km northwards. In the attack, a 57-year-old man, Antonín Blažek, attempted to blow up <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>of</b> flats after having been ordered to vacate his flat that had been foreclosed by creditors. He first blocked both exits from the building, and then removed and opened the main gas supply into the building's corridor. Interrupted, Blažek set the gas on fire before the gas could spread throughout the whole building. The explosion and subsequent fire, however, were large enough to demolish part of the building, killing Blažek and five other people immediately and wounding eleven others, one of whom died on 17 February 2015.|$|E
5|$|Early on Boxing Day 1964, Hindley {{left her}} {{grandmother}} at a relative's house {{and refused to}} allow her back to Wardle Brook Avenue that night. On the same day, 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey disappeared from a funfair in Ancoats. Despite a huge search, she was not found. The following day, Hindley brought her grandmother back home. By February 1965, Patricia Hodges had stopped visiting 16Wardle Brook Avenue, but David Smith was still a regular visitor. Brady gave Smith books to read, and the two discussed robbery and murder. On Hindley's 23rd birthday, her sister and brother-in-law, who had until then been living with relatives, were rehoused in Underwood Court, <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>of</b> flats not far from Wardle Brook Avenue. The two couples began {{to see each other}} more regularly, but usually only on Brady's terms.|$|E
5|$|Homer portrays Paul Bunyan, a great {{burden on}} the local townspeople, as he crushes their houses and greedily eats all their food. Eventually, the townspeople drug him and drag him out of their town. Out of loneliness, Bunyan carves <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>of</b> stone from the {{mountains}} into a blue ox that he calls Babe, who is rendered alive by an electric shock. In his travels with Babe, Homer creates several landmarks. Bunyan later meets a young woman, (played by Marge) and though she is initially frightened of him, the two fall in love. When a meteor is soon to hit the town, the townspeople call Paul back to help them. Paul obliges and throws the meteor towards Chicago, starting the Great Fire there, but not before it hits him in the backside.|$|E

The stadium {{authorities}} refused to reissue the tickets on crowd safety grounds, and threatened to eject anyone found sitting in the block from the stadium and possibly prosecute them for receiving stolen goods. Liverpool F.C. arranged for most of the affected fans to receive tickets from an allocation that had been held back for a lottery among their supporters. The day after the final, South Wales Police seized 100 stolen tickets. Three people were arrested after 15 forged tickets were found ahead of the match.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns reveals to Smithers that {{he misses}} his {{cherished}} bear Bobo and desperately wants it back {{but has no}} idea where it is. Another flashback reveals Bobo's history: after Mr. Burns leaves it behind, the bear eventually finds its way to Charles Lindbergh, who tosses the bear into a crowd, where it is caught by Adolf Hitler. In 1945, Hitler blames Bobo for losing World War II and tosses him away. Bobo is seen again in 1957 on board the USS Nautilus headed for the North Pole. Bobo becomes encased in <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>of</b> ice until picked up by an ice-gathering expedition in 1993. The bag of ice with Bobo in it {{is sent to the}} Kwik-E-Mart in Springfield. Bart buys the bag of ice, finds Bobo inside and gives it to Maggie to play with.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for the {{expedition}} {{was given to}} Sivert Klevan, an engineer with a good instinct for public relations. The ice was to be procured from the glacier Svartisen, and a glaciologist was brought along to give advice. It {{soon became clear that}} the entire three-ton block could not be brought out in one go. Instead, 200kg blocks were cut out with a chainsaw, carried away on a sled, and flown by helicopter down to the town centre. There they were melted together to make <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>of</b> ice weighing 3,050kg. The block was placed in a specially constructed iron container, which was insulated with wood and glass wool. The container was placed on top of a truck that would carry {{it all the way to}} the Equator, accompanied by a van carrying equipment and a sedan with a film crew.|$|E

5|$|Seneb is {{depicted}} {{with his wife}} and children in a painted sculpture from his tomb, rediscovered in 1926, that is a famous example of Old Kingdom art. It shows him sitting cross-legged on <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>of</b> stone with his wife embracing him and his children standing below him where the legs of a full-size person would ordinarily have been. The composition of the scene thus achieves a harmonious symmetry. It depicts Seneb realistically with the facial features and shortened limbs of an individual with achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism. Paintings and carvings in the tomb give his titles and depict various scenes from his life, such as carrying out inspections of his estate and holding symbols of his office.|$|E

The next shooting schedule, which began on 18 March, lasted for three weeks. Night scenes focusing on Mahesh and others were filmed in Kukatpally in mid-April.|$|E
