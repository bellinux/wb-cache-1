5|$|On 20 August 636, {{the final}} day of the battle, Khalid put into action <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>but</b> bold plan of attack. With his massed cavalry force he {{intended}} to drive the Byzantine cavalry entirely off the battlefield so that the infantry, which formed the bulk of the imperial army, would be left without cavalry support and thus would be exposed when attacked from the flanks and rear.|$|E
5|$|From 1915 Gaudí devoted himself almost {{exclusively}} to his magnum opus, the Sagrada Família, a synthesis of his architectural evolution. After completion of the crypt and the apse, still in Gothic style, {{the rest of the}} church is conceived in an organic style, imitating natural shapes with their abundance of ruled surfaces. He intended the interior to resemble a forest, with inclined columns like branching trees, helicoidal in form, creating <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>but</b> sturdy structure. Gaudí applied all of his previous experimental findings in this project, from works such as the Park Güell and the crypt of the Colònia Güell, creating a church that is at once structurally perfect, harmonious and aesthetically satisfying.|$|E

5|$|The {{committee}} was reliant on public donations and realised {{that it was}} unlikely to raise a large sum of money as communities across Devon would be focusing on their own commemorations and commissioning individual war memorials. Despite this, the {{committee was}} determined to erect some sort of memorial to the county's war dead, and as a compromise sought <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>but</b> elegant monument. They commissioned Lutyens in 1920 and opted for his War Cross design. The committee considered several potential sites, including Cawsand Beacon on Dartmoor and the Haldon Hills in south Devon, but the committee's preferred location was the cathedral close of Exeter, Devon's county town. The specific site was chosen so that the memorial would be visible from the High Street and Broadgate. With its remaining funds, the Devon County War Memorial Committee supported {{the construction of a}} battlefield memorial at La Ville-aux-Bois-lès-Pontavert in France to honour the 2nd Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment, who endured particularly heavy fighting at Bois des Buttes during the Third Battle of the Aisne.|$|E
5|$|The first {{example of}} his final stage {{can be seen in}} <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>but</b> very ingenious building, the Sagrada Família schools, a small school for the workers' children. Built in 1909, it has a {{rectangular}} ground plan of , and contained three classrooms, a vestibule and a chapel. It was built of exposed brick, in three overlapping layers, following the traditional Catalan method. The walls and roof have an undulating shape, giving the structure a sense of lightness but also strength. The Sagrada Família schools have set an example of constructive genius and have served as a source of inspiration for many architects, such is their simplicity, strength, originality, functionality and geometric excellence.|$|E

25|$|The Turing test is {{concerned}} strictly {{with how the}} subject acts– the external behaviour of the machine.

Kabakov interpreted the work as <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>but</b> universal metaphor about the individual who is always waiting for something, but never receives anything. Instead, the Italians and critics of communism interpreted the work as signifying Soviet culture and its lack of material reward. The publicity Kabakov received prevented him from getting work as an illustrator for four years, forcing him to work under someone else’s name. The use of an alter ego would become a common tool in Kabakov’s unofficial artwork.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>simple</b> <b>but</b> less-used {{technique}} is checking oculomotor responses with an optokinetic nystagmus drum, where {{the subject is}} placed inside the drum and surrounded by rotating black and white stripes. This creates involuntary abrupt eye movements (nystagmus) as the brain attempts to track the moving stripes. There is a good correspondence between the optokinetic and usual eye-chart acuities in adults. A potentially serious problem with this {{technique is}} that the process is reflexive and mediated in the low-level brain stem, not in the visual cortex. Thus someone can have a normal optokinetic response and yet be cortically blind with no conscious visual sensation.|$|E
