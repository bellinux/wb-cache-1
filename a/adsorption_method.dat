50|$|<b>Adsorption</b> <b>Method</b> for Sampling of Dioxins and Furans (AMESA) is an {{automatic}} system for continuous monitoring of emissions of {{dioxins and furans}} from industrial processes which require official approval in compliance with environmental regulations. Applications include refuse incinerators and hazardous material incinerators.|$|E
50|$|Silica fume is an {{ultrafine}} {{material with}} spherical particles less than 1 μm in diameter, the average being about 0.15 μm. This makes it approximately 100 times {{smaller than the}} average cement particle. The bulk density of silica fume depends {{on the degree of}} densification in the silo and varies from 130 (undensified) to 600 kg/m3. The specific gravity of silica fume is generally in the range of 2.2 to 2.3. The specific surface area of silica fume can be measured with the BET method or nitrogen <b>adsorption</b> <b>method.</b> It typically ranges from 15,000 to 30,000 m2/kg.|$|E
30|$|Researchers {{have tried}} hard to develop less {{hazardous}} and environmentally safe formulations (El-Nahhal et al. 2001; Lagaly 2001; Nir et al. 2000; Rytwo 2005), including <b>adsorption</b> <b>methods.</b>|$|R
30|$|Conclusions: More than BD event itself, {{the initial}} BI seems to induce the {{essential}} of immune phenotype changes leading to innate immunosuppression.

30|$|The {{most common}} methods used for removal of phenol from {{industrial}} effluents include stripping, solvent extraction, oxidation, ion exchange, biodegradation and <b>adsorption</b> <b>methods</b> (Subramanyam and Das 2009). Out {{of all these}} treatment <b>methods,</b> <b>adsorption</b> process is recognized as the most efficient, promising and widely used fundamental approach in wastewater treatment processes, mainly hinging on its simplicity, economically viable, technically feasible and socially acceptable (Foo and Hameed 2010).|$|R
50|$|Values {{obtained}} for specific surface area {{depend on the}} method of measurement. In adsorption based methods, {{the size of the}} adsorbate molecule (the probe molecule), the exposed crystallographic planes at the surface and measurement temperature all affect the obtained specific surface area. For this reason, in addition to the most commonly used Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (N2-BET) <b>adsorption</b> <b>method,</b> several techniques have been developed to measure the specific surface area of particulate materials at ambient temperatures and at controllable scales, including methylene blue (MB) staining, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether (EGME) adsorption, electrokinetic analysis of complex-ion adsorption and a Protein Retention (PR) method.|$|E
5000|$|Depending on a solid surface's {{ability to}} {{successfully}} form a conjugate base by absorbing an electrically neutral acid, the basic {{strength of the}} surface is determined. [...] "The number of basic sites per unit surface area of the solid" [...] is used to express how much base is found on a solid base catalyst. Scientists have developed two methods to measure the amount of basic sites: titration with benzoic acid using indicators and gaseous acid adsorption. A solid with enough basic strength will absorb an electrically neutral acid indicator and cause the acid indicator's color to change {{to the color of}} its conjugate base. When performing the gaseous acid <b>adsorption</b> <b>method,</b> nitric oxide is used. The basic sites are then determined using the amount of carbon dioxide than is absorbed.|$|E
50|$|The key {{aspect of}} {{competitive}} absorption involves two substrates that phase-separate due {{to one or}} more opposite physical or chemical properties. When these substrates are mixed with a nanoparticle, typically gold, they maintain their separation and form two faces.A good example of this technique has been demonstrated by Vilain et al., where phosphinine-coated gold nanoparticles were exposed to long-chain thiols, resulting in substitution of the phosphinine ligands in a phase-separated manner to produce Janus nanoparticles. Phase separation was proven by showing the thiols formed one locally pure domain on the nanoparticle using FT-IR.Jakobs et al. demonstrated a major issue with the competitive <b>adsorption</b> <b>method</b> when they attempted to synthesize amphiphilic gold Janus nanoparticles using the competitive adsorption of hydrophobic and hydrophilic thiols. The synthesis demonstrated was quite simple and only involved two steps. First gold nanoparticles capped with tetra-n-octylammonium bromide were produced. Then the capping agent was removed followed by the addition of various ratios of hydrophilic disulfide functionalized ethylene oxide and hydrophobic disulfide functionalized oligo(p-phenylenevinylene). They then attempted to prove that phase separation on the particle surface occurred by comparing the contact angles of water on the surface of a monolayer of the Janus particles with nanoparticles made with only the hydrophobic or hydrophobic ligands. Instead the results of this experiment showed that while there was some phase separation, it was not complete. This result highlights that the ligand choice is extremely important and any changes may result in incomplete phase separation.|$|E

However, using Amberlite 2 or 16 resins or wood activated carbon also requires solvents for rhamnolipid recovery (Dubey et al. 2005; Heyd et al. 2008).|$|R

40|$|The author {{performed}} Donaggio {{reaction and}} Akamatsu-Shinmei reaction usiug urinary mucoprotein A(1), A(2), A(3), isolated by the benzoic acid <b>adsorption</b> <b>method</b> of Anderson, Tamm's urinary mucoprotein, urinary mucoprotein obtained by talcum powder <b>adsorption</b> <b>method</b> and Winzler's serum mucoprotein. The author also determined the excretion of Anderson's mucoprotein in fatigue condition. The results obtained are as follows. 1) Anderson's mucoprotein {{proves to be}} strongly positive to Donaggio reaction and the concentration showing one Donaggio unit is 50 - 100 γ/ml, showing the activity almost {{similar to that of}} the Donaggio reaction-positive substance performed by talcum powder <b>adsorption</b> <b>method.</b> 2) The activity of Donaggio reaction of the human serum mucoprotein processed by Winzler's method, whose concentration showing one Donaggio unit being around 31. 2 γ/ml, seems to be higher than that of the Donaggio reaction-positive substance by talcum powder <b>adsorption</b> <b>method.</b> 3) Anderson's urinary mucoprotein is also positive to Akamatsu-Shinmei reaction. 4) Tamm's urinary mucoprotein is Donaggio reaction negative, but after heating it becomes weakly positive, while to Shinmei reaction, it is weakly positive and heating increases its positivity still further. 5) The concentration of urinary mucoprotein prepared by Anderson's quantitative method, increased in the workers of a department store after the work, and in soccer players after the game. Moreover, the quantity of hourly excretion of urinary mucoprotein also increased after the work in the case of workers in the department store. 6) Donaggio reaction values and the quantities of Anderson's urinary mucoprotein fluctuated in parallel to each other after the work and after the game. 7) The recovery rate of the Donaggio reaction values determined by benzoic acid <b>adsorption</b> <b>method</b> of Anderson proved to be 30 - 50 per cent showing the values close to those by talcum powder <b>adsorption</b> <b>method</b> of Honda. 8) From these results, it is deduced that the mucoprotein (Donaggio reaction positive substance) prepared by the talcum powder <b>adsorption</b> <b>method</b> resembles very closely to Anderson's mucoprotein and these two are most likely derived from serum α(1) -globulin, and Tamm's mucoprotein that is negative to Donaggio reaction is in all probability a different mucoprotein excreted in the urinary tract...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cellulose accessibilities {{of a set}} of hornified {{lignocellulosic}} substrates {{derived by}} drying the never dried pretreated sample and a set of differently pretreated lodge-pople pine substrates, were evaluated using solute exclusion and protein <b>adsorption</b> <b>methods.</b> Direct measurements of cellulase adsorption onto cellulose surface of the set of pretreated substrates were also carried out using an in situ UV–Vis spectrophotometric technique. The cellulose accessibilities measured by the solute exclusion and a cellu-lose-binding module (CBM) -containing green fluorescent protein (TGC) <b>adsorption</b> <b>methods</b> correlate well for both sets of samples. The substrate enzymatic digestibilities (SEDs) of the hornified substrates are proportional to the measured cellulose accessibilities. Approximately over 90 % of the SED was contributed by the accessible pore surfaces of the hornified substrates, suggesting that the substrate exter-nal surface plays a minor role contributing to cellulose accessibility and SED. The cellulose accessibilities of the pretreated substrates correlated well with the amounts of cellulase adsorbed. The SEDs of these substrates directly correlated with the amounts of adsorbed cellulase...|$|R
