5|$|The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority was {{exempt from}} {{requirements}} {{to have a}} federal environmental impact study (EIS) conducted on the Creek Turnpike project. As part of {{their opposition to the}} turnpike, Tulsans Against Turnpikes challenged this right. The group announced in April 1989 that if the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), and U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) did not force OTA to conduct an EIS within 60 days they would sue the three federal agencies. Tulsans Against Turnpikes, joined by an area homeowners' association, John Reidel (<b>a</b> <b>homeowner</b> whose property was condemned by OTA and had filed previous suits as early as the 1950s to stop the turnpike's construction), and several other affected individuals, filed the suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma on August 10. Defendants in the suit included the federal agencies, state transportation and environmental agencies, and the city of Tulsa. That November, Tulsans Against Turnpikes filed a motion requesting an injunction against further work on the turnpike.|$|E
5|$|This king {{established}} {{a number of}} enduring traditions in Imerina. A law imposing a fine on <b>a</b> <b>homeowner</b> whose house fire destroys neighboring property was promulgated by Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana. He also established the rule that all citizens of Ambohimanga or Antananarivo should pass to offer hasina to the sovereign and wish him or her a long life if a fire ever broke out in their city, and that citizens should likewise congratulate the owners of houses that were spared from destruction if a fire had occurred nearby. He designated specific areas where water could be drawn for use in royal circumcision ceremonies. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana also created three formal ways of pronouncing a sacred and binding oath; these included the mively rano (striking {{the surface of a}} body of water with a stick), the milefon'omby (striking a calf with a spear) and the misotro vokaka (drinking water mixed with ashes taken from a king's tomb). After capturing Ambohitrabiby, he obliged all the andriana (nobles) and other powerful figures in the community there to formalize their allegiance to him by enacting one of these oaths.|$|E

25|$|To ensure {{effective}} arbitration and {{to increase}} the general credibility of the arbitral process, arbitrators will sometimes sit as a panel, usually consisting of three arbitrators. Often the three consist of {{an expert in the}} legal area within which the dispute falls (such as contract law {{in the case of a}} dispute over the terms and conditions of a contract), an expert in the industry within which the dispute falls (such as the construction industry, in the case of a dispute between <b>a</b> <b>homeowner</b> and his general contractor), and an experienced arbitrator.|$|E
25|$|According to some, {{the century}} egg has over five centuries of history behind its production. Its discovery, though not verifiable, {{was said to}} have {{occurred}} around 600 years ago in Hunan during the Ming Dynasty, when <b>a</b> <b>homeowner</b> discovered duck eggs in a shallow pool of slaked lime that was used for mortar during construction of his home two months before. Upon tasting the eggs, he set out to produce more — this time with the addition of salt to improve their flavor — resulting in the present recipe of the century egg.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{industries}} (small-scale services, for example) tend to {{have more}} VAT avoidance, particularly where cash transactions predominate, and VAT may be criticized for encouraging this. From the perspective of government, however, VAT may be preferable because it captures {{at least some of the}} value added. For example, a building contractor may offer to provide services for cash (i.e. without a receipt, and without VAT) to <b>a</b> <b>homeowner,</b> who usually cannot claim input VAT back. The homeowner will thus bear lower costs and the building contractor may be able to avoid other taxes (profit or payroll taxes).|$|E

Specifically, the Court permitted the City of New London, Connecticut, to force <b>a</b> <b>homeowner</b> to sell her home for new development. The decision that eminent domain could be used to issue a condemnation order on a property for a private purpose caused a backlash.|$|E
25|$|Station {{placement}} and design {{were intended to}} be flexible and change over time, as stations could be built or closed at low cost. However, they were at times dictated by politics rather planning: stops in Ruxton, Riderwood, and Village of Cross Keys were removed due to local opposition, while Mt. Royal and Timonium Business Park stations were kept because the University of Baltimore and a local business group funded them. Falls Road station was built with less parking than ridership required because of community requests, and a fence - erected in response to <b>a</b> <b>homeowner</b> objecting to the visual impact of the station - prevented riders from accessing a nearby commercial building.|$|E
25|$|In November 1948, {{the first}} of these new homes were {{completed}} and ready for occupancy. These one-story, three bedroom houses were constructed on concrete slabs with radiant heating - construction atypical of New England and initially viewed with suspicion by some. This suspicion was apparently unwarranted since the market value of some of the original houses is now over $450,000. The cost of a basic house was $7,820; but <b>a</b> <b>homeowner</b> could also add cedar shingles for $319.00; cedar clapboards with gypsum sheathing ($247.00); a breezeway-type porch without a garage ($325.00) or with a garage ($1,250.00); or a detached garage ($925.00). Some homeowners took advantage of these extras when they selected their houses, while others chose to wait and made additions to their houses at a later date.|$|E

25|$|Biglow and Main were {{concerned}} that the book would diminish sales of Crosby's Bells at Evening and Other Verses, which they had published in 1897 and which contained Lowry's biographical sketch of Crosby. They convinced Crosby to write to both Carleton and Knapp, and to threaten to sue Carleton in April 1904. The threatened lawsuit was to obtain information regarding sales of the book, for which she had been promised a royalty of 10 cents per copy, and to seek an injunction preventing further publication. The proposed injunction was {{on the grounds that}} she had been misrepresented by Carleton; she believed that he had described her as living alone in poor health and extreme poverty, when in fact she was receiving $25 a week from Biglow and Main and was living with relatives who cared for her. Crosby indicated she had no desire to be <b>a</b> <b>homeowner,</b> and that if she ever lived in poverty, it was by her own choice.|$|E
25|$|Above we {{have used}} the {{standard}} mathematical formula for the sum of a geometric series. (Or if ireal =0 then the series in braces sums to p since it then has p equal terms). As an example, assume that S=60,000 per year {{and that it is}} desired to replace Rrepl=0.80, or 80%, of pre-retirement living standard for p=30 years. Assume for current purposes that a proportion z prop=0.25 (25%) of pay was being saved. Using ireal=0.02, or 2% per year real return on investments, the necessary lump sum is given by the formula as (1-0.25)*0.80*60,000*annuity-series-sum(30)=36,000*22.396=806,272 in the nation's currency in 2008–2010 terms. To allow for inflation in a straightforward way, it is best to talk of the 806,272 as being '13.43 years of retirement age salary'. It may be appropriate to regard this as being the necessary lump sum to fund 36,000 of annual supplements to any employer or government pensions that are available. It is common to not include any house value in the calculation of this necessary lump sum, so for <b>a</b> <b>homeowner</b> the lump sum pays primarily for non-housing living costs.|$|E
25|$|Domestic kobolds {{are linked}} to a {{specific}} household. Some legends claim that every house has a resident kobold, regardless of its owners' desires or needs. The means by which a kobold enters a new home vary from tale to tale. One tradition claims that the kobold enters the household by announcing itself at night by strewing wood chips about the house and putting dirt or cow manure in the milk cans. If {{the master of the}} house leaves the wood chips and drinks the soiled milk, the kobold takes up residence. The kobold Heinzelmann of Hundermühlen Castle arrived in 1584 and announced himself by knocking and making other sounds. Should someone take pity on a kobold {{in the form of a}} cold, wet creature and take it inside to warm it, the spirit takes up residence there. A tradition from Perleberg in northern Germany says that <b>a</b> <b>homeowner</b> must follow specific instructions to lure a kobold to his house. He must go on St John's Day between noon and one o'clock, into the forest. When he finds an anthill with a bird on it, he must say a certain phrase, which causes the bird to transform into a small person. The figure then leaps into a bag carried by the homeowner, and he can then transfer the kobold to his home. Even if servants come and go, the kobold stays.|$|E
