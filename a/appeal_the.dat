5|$|If the High Court {{refuses to}} hear an <b>appeal,</b> <b>the</b> case cannot proceed further; similarly, with one exception, once the High Court has heard a case, no {{decision}} may be reviewed by the Court of <b>Appeal.</b> <b>The</b> one exception is laid out in Section 1(7), and provides that leave to appeal is only valid if either the High Court or Court of Appeal certifies it as such, and the High Court confirms that the case concerns a point of law which merits consideration. In National Westminster Bank Plc v Arthur Young McClelland Moores & Co (No.1), the Court of Appeal confirmed that, once the High Court {{has decided not to}} allow an <b>appeal,</b> <b>the</b> registrar of the Court of Appeal cannot intervene and otherwise validate such a request.|$|E

5000|$|After a case {{is decided}} in <b>the</b> Court of <b>Appeals,</b> <b>the</b> losing party may chose {{to accept the}} result, or to <b>appeal</b> further to <b>the</b> Supreme Court of Missouri. In most <b>appeals,</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court of Missouri may, and often does, reject an <b>appeal</b> from <b>the</b> Court of <b>Appeals</b> (called [...] "discretionary jurisdiction"). Historically, less than ten percent of <b>the</b> <b>appeals</b> heard by <b>the</b> Missouri Court of Appeals are {{transferred}} to the Supreme Court. Thus, {{for the vast majority}} of <b>appeals,</b> <b>the</b> Court of <b>Appeals</b> decision is final.|$|R

50|$|The {{admissibility}} of {{an appeal}} may be assessed {{at every stage}} of <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> proceedings.

If <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> is admissible, <b>the</b> Board of <b>Appeal</b> examines whether <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> is allowable, i.e. the Board addresses {{the merits of the}} case.|$|R
5|$|The Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota sued {{in federal}} court to {{overturn}} those regulations. The district courts agreed with them, but upon <b>appeal,</b> <b>the</b> Eighth Circuit consolidated the two cases into one and reversed the judgments, remanding the cases for entry of judgments {{in favor of the}} United States. This decision was at odds with decisions from the Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits, which had all previously ruled that residents may count as students for the purpose of FICA taxes. The Eighth Circuit's ruling created a circuit split, and on <b>appeal,</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.|$|E
5|$|The accused had {{no right}} of <b>appeal.</b> <b>The</b> right was given to their {{relatives}} or other interested persons {{but they were not}} allowed to nominate psychiatrists {{to take part in the}} evaluation, because all psychiatrists were considered fully independent and equally credible before the law.|$|E
5|$|This {{process was}} {{temporarily}} halted in February 2000 due to numerous false billing claims. Following a judicial {{decision by the}} Ontario Divisional Court on November 7, 2005, the Ontario Registrar of Motor Vehicles was ordered to begin denying the validation or issue of Canadian license plates and vehicle permits for 407ETR users who have failed to pay owed fees. On November 22, 2005, the MTO {{announced that it would}} <b>appeal</b> <b>the</b> decision but would begin to deny plates until the appeal was decided. On February 24, 2006, the Ontario Court of Appeals denied the government leave to <b>appeal</b> <b>the</b> 2005 decision. As a result, plate denial remains in place.|$|E

50|$|If the sentence, as {{approved}} by the convening authority, includes death, a bad-conduct discharge, a dishonorable discharge, dismissal of an officer, or confinement for one year or more, the case is reviewed by an intermediate court. There are four such courts—the Army Court of Criminal <b>Appeals,</b> <b>the</b> Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal <b>Appeals,</b> <b>the</b> Air Force Court of Criminal <b>Appeals,</b> and <b>the</b> Coast Guard Court of Criminal <b>Appeals.</b> <b>The</b> Courts of Criminal <b>Appeals</b> review <b>the</b> cases for legal error, factual sufficiency, and sentence appropriateness. All other cases are subject to review by judge advocates under regulations issued by each service. After such review, the Judge Advocate General may refer a case to the appropriate Court of Criminal <b>Appeals.</b> <b>The</b> Courts of Criminal Appeals also have jurisdiction under Article 62 of the UCMJ to consider <b>appeals</b> by <b>the</b> United States of certain judicial rulings during trial. Review under Article 62 is limited to issues involving alleged legal errors.|$|R

The Tamil Tigers also established and implemented a Judicial system which consisted of district courts, high courts and supreme court {{as well as a}} court of <b>appeal.</b> <b>The</b> supreme court was also located in Kilinochchi.|$|E

Fourteen days later, Wotton was sentenced to seven years in prison, reduced to six years for time already served. His family has no plans to <b>appeal</b> <b>the</b> sentence.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the poor}} sound quality limits its {{commercial}} <b>appeal,</b> <b>the</b> album provides historic {{insight into the}} group's club act in the period after Ringo Starr joined but before the emergence of Beatlemania. The Beatles were unsuccessful in legally blocking the initial release of the album; the recordings were reissued in many forms until 1998, when the group were awarded full rights to the performances.|$|E
5|$|At the DAP, Hitler met Dietrich Eckart, {{one of the}} party's founders and {{a member}} of the occult Thule Society.
