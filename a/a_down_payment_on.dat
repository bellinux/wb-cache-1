5|$|The series {{features}} customers, usually two {{to three}} per episode, bringing in anything they believe is resalable within reason to the dealership to help {{cover the cost of}} a new or used vehicle (including pigs, maple syrup, and collectable dolls), rather than paying for it with cash. The customers then negotiate the value of their items, usually with Gardner, but occasionally also {{with other members of the}} shop's staff. The trade usually is not enough to cover the full value of the car or truck; because of this, the value of the trade provides the customers with <b>a</b> <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> the vehicle. Once the trade is completed, Todd, Darcy, and Travis take the items the dealership has acquired and attempt to resell them for a profit.|$|E
5|$|After {{more than}} 60 years of {{continuous}} operation, the Cacchio family {{decided to sell}} the Theatre. Rather than sell to real estate developers, the Cacchios preferred to transfer the property to the Rosendale Theatre Collective, a nonprofit formed in late 2009 {{for the sole purpose}} of buying and preserving the Theatre. The group spent months raising funds for <b>a</b> <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> the building, with the bulk of its money coming from small individual donations. About 60 fundraisers were held, and a large grant was provided by PepsiCo after the Theatre Collective ran a successful social networking campaign for the April 2010 Pepsi Refresh Project. The Cacchios transferred ownership of the property to the Theatre Collective on August19, 2010. Since its purchase, the Theatre has had several equipment upgrades, including a move to digital cinema.|$|E

The RTC {{attributed}} its success in the contest to its use of social networking services, notably Facebook.

Although Cisneros had written her first poem around the age of ten, with her teacher's encouragement she became known for her writing throughout her high-school years. In high school she wrote poetry and was the literary magazine editor, but, according to herself, she did not really start writing until her first creative writing class in college in 1974.
