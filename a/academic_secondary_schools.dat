40|$|Abstract. The {{educational}} system in Austria is very multifaceted, and <b>academic</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>schools</b> represent {{an important part}} in it. This type of schools, in German called “Gymnasium”, covers the age-group from 10 to 18 years and provides pupils and students with a broad and general education. For more than twenty years, informatics and computers have increasingly penetrated into secondary education. Austrian <b>academic</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>schools</b> have much freedom to cope with this challenging task within their autonomy. In this paper, a snapshot of the current situation is given with the main emphasis on the 9 th grade. Only in this age-group, the “PISA-age”, informatics is a compulsory subject. The implementation of additional IT/informatics classes at lower secondary level is exclusively the result of autonomous decisions in schools. Recently, a web-based nationwide online research has been conducted. In this paper some preliminary results are presented...|$|E
40|$|Analyzes the {{historical}} variation {{of secondary school}} tracking in formerly socialist Czechoslovakia, using multinomial logistic regression & focusing {{on the effects of}} family background on the odds of making the transition to vocational, technical, or <b>academic</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>schools.</b> I also test various hypotheses regarding trends in educational reproduction, socioeconomic inequality in access to secondary education, & the impact of political status of parents on access to secondary education. Educational expansion, unlike 'communist affirmative action,' dramatically reduced educational reproduction at the secondary level. Positive & negative {{discrimination on the basis of}} parental occupation, however, considerably diminished the advantage of higher status children in the transition to vocational & technical schools in the early 1950 s & 1970 s, but never affected access to <b>academic</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>schools.</b> The consequences of parental political status for their children's education display remarkable variation, which is unmistakably responsive to historical events. The multinomial transition model also reveals the cross-temporal dynamics of tracking in Czechoslovakia. The postwar expansion of the educational system brought about double benefits. While larger numbers of lower-class, rural, & female students enrolled in secondary schools, their higher enrollments were confined to vocational schools. Though a large number of higher status children were enrolled throughout the 1948 - 1989 period, their enrollments in vocational schools dropped as they began to fill positions in the growing technical & academic schools...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{conducted}} a comparative {{analysis of the}} earnings of workers in Israel who had last attended vocational schools {{and those who had}} last attended <b>academic</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>schools</b> before entering the labor force. Their findings suggest that Israel may provide an example of an educational system in which vocational schooling is economically effective. Vocational schooling in Israel has proven more cost-effective than general academic training. In particular, vocational school attenders who later worked in occupations related to their course of study earned more. Their wages were up to 10 percent more a month than their peers who studied at <b>academic</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>schools</b> and those who attended vocational schools but found employment in other occupations not related to their field of study. These results reinforce similar findings in recent research on vocational schooling in the United States. A caveat is necessary to temper the generally positive findings concerning vocational schooling in Israel. While vocational schooling is cost-effective compared with other forms of secondary schooling, it does not compare favorably with other forms of training for skilled trades, such as apprenticeships and factory-based vocational schools. Another factor is the national consensus in Israel favoring education designed to equip young people for the social and cultural role of integrating the country's heterogenous, largely immigrant population.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the basis of production of educational knowledge transmitted through boy's <b>academic</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>schools</b> under the prewar system in Japan ("Kyusei-chugaku"). Sociology of, or social history of science have investigated the institutionalization of scientific activity : production of 'academic'knowledge. However, little attention has been paid to producing 'educational'knowledge as a unique form of knowledge production. In order to achieve the aim, this paper investigates the authors of textbooks that were found, based mainly on official documents, in use at boy's <b>academic</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>schools</b> in the mid-Meiji to the early Showa period Tokyo. To begin with, it is argued that a community that played an important part in production of textbooks, which took on the nature of production of educational knowledge, appeared in the mid-Meiji period. Next, the authors are analyzed by their occupation, social origin, and educational background (prosopographical approach). The major findings are as follows : (1) Centers of producing educational knowledge moved from secondary schools to post-secondary schools during the last part of Meiji period. (2) Many of the authors came from Tokyo and were out of families of the samurai antecedents. (3) Graduates from post-secondary schools, especially the Imperial University of Tokyo, played an important role in the establishing process of production of educational knowledge in Japan...|$|E

30|$|Austria’s upper {{secondary}} educational system contains four main types of schools 3 : academic secondary school (“Gymnasium Oberstufe”, AHS-Oberstufe); colleges for {{higher vocational education}} (“Berufsbildende Schulen”, BHS); schools for intermediate vocational education (“Berufsbildende Mittlere Schule”, BMS); and apprenticeships (dual education and vocational education). <b>Academic</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>schools</b> are 4  years in duration, and colleges for higher vocational education are 5  years. Both school types finish with a general qualification for university entrance. This {{is not the case}} for the other school types like apprenticeships, which are a characteristic of the Austrian, German, Danish and Swiss school systems (Ebner 2013). In the dual apprenticeship system young people are employed for practical training in a company and simultaneously attend a school. In order to meet the compulsory education of nine years, the students have to attend a pre-vocational school (“Polytechnikum”) before they can start an apprenticeship.|$|E

For example, if parents perceive that the accumulation of skills has a high return—say in terms of their children eventually gaining admission into a selective university or securing high-wage employment—they will be more willing to invest their time and money in schooling. Similarly, the organization of the education system may affect parents’ investment choices. To illustrate, some European and African countries have school systems structured such that not all children are entitled to the transition from primary into <b>academic</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>schools.</b> Their entry, as the school and class to which they are assigned, is contingent on testing performance. Similarly, some countries (e.g., Brazil, Chile, and Turkey) rely largely on test-based admissions for higher education. Parents may be more willing to pay for tutoring in such settings.|$|E

40|$|When {{students}} are tracked into vocational and <b>academic</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>schools,</b> access {{to higher education}} is usually restricted to those who completed an academic track. Postponing such tracking may increase university attendance among disadvantaged students if additional time in school enables them to catch up with their more privileged counterparts. However, if ability and expectations are fairly well set by an early age, postponing tracking during adolescence may not have much effect. This paper exploits an educational reform in Romania to examine the impact of postponing tracking on the proportion of disadvantaged students graduating from university using a regression discontinuity (RD) design. We show that, although students from poor, rural areas and with less educated parents {{were significantly more likely to}} finish an academic track and become eligible to apply for university after the reform, this did not translate into an increase in university completion. Our findings indicate that simply postponing tracking, without increasing the slots available in university, is not sufficient to improve {{access to higher education}} for disadvantaged groups. ...|$|E
40|$|How does NCLB fit in an {{international}} context? Here's what's happening {{in the rest of}} the world. Standardized testing is controversial everywhere, regardless of its purpose. Most countries use testing for tracking and for selecting students for admission into <b>academic</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>schools</b> or universities, but generally not for holding educators accountable. Many countries don't even administer standardized tests until the later grades. In fact, most Canadian universities don't require the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) or other standardized admissions tests—except for students applying with a U. S. high school diploma! (Ghosh, 2004) In a recent collection of studies of education systems worldwide, which I edited, 1 numerous experts discussed current education policies in their countries, including the role that standardized testing plays in their public schools (Rotberg, 2004).

40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper based on Israeli census data, the authors showed that {{vocational}} school completers achieved higher earnings than their counter-parts who attended <b>academic</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>schools,</b> {{but only if}} they worked in occupations related to the vocational course of study pursued. These findings were challenged by Lawrence Hotchkiss; using U. S. follow-up data from the High School and Beyond survey, he argued that the wage advantage of vocational school completers working in related occupations stemmed from employment in a well-paid occupation (a possibility not examined in our earlier estimating model) and was not the result of the training received. In this paper, we replicate the U. S. study using our Israeli data base; the results strongly confirm those from our earlier study. How may the contrasting results for Israel and the United States be explained? We suggest that the U. S. study may be faulted; its focus on young workers in their first job after graduation, may have led to unduly pessimistic results with regard to the labor market outcomes of vocational schooling. ...|$|E
